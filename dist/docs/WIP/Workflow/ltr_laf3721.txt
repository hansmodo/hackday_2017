My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 15th has safely come to hand. 
I am going to give you an account of matters in 
this quarter. The greater part of the enemy are at 
York, which they do not as yet fortify ; but are very 
busy upon Gloucester Neck, where they have a pretty 
large corps under Colonel Dundas. They have at York a forty-four gun ship; frigates and vessels are 
scattered lower down. There is still a small garrison 
at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Should they intend to evacuate, at 
least, they are proceeding with alarming slowness. 
</p><p>
From the enemy's preparations I should infer that 
they are working for the protection of a fleet, and 
for a defence against another ; that in case they 
hold <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, the main body would he at York, 
and a detached corps upon Gloucester Neck, to protect the water hattery. Their fortifications are much 
contracted. From the enemy's cautious and partial 
movements, I should conclude their intelligence is not 
very good, and they wish to come at an explanation 
of my intentions and prospects. We have hitherto 
occupied the Forks of York River, thereby looking 
both ways. Some militia have prevented the enemy's 
parties from remaining any time at or near <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and false accounts have given them some alarms. 
Another body of militia, under Colonel Innes, has kept 
them pretty close in Gloucester town, and foraged in 
their vicinity. 
</p><p>
Upon the receipt of your orders, I wrote to the 
Governor that the intelligence of some plans of the 
enemy rendered it proper to have six hundred militia collected upon Blackwater. I wrote to General Gregory, near <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, that I had an account the 
enemy intended to push a detachment to Carolina, 
which would greatly defeat a scheme we had there. 
I have requested <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> to move towards the 
southward, and be ready to cross James River at Westover. A battalion of light infantry, and our only one 
hundred dragoons, being in Gloucester county, I call 
them my van-guard, and shall take my quarters there 
for one or two days, while the troops are filing off 
towards James River. Our little army will conseqiiently again assemble upon the waters of the Chickahominy ; and should Jamestown Island be thought a 
good place for a junction, we shall be in a situation 
to form it, while we render it more difficult for the 
enemy to attempt a journey to Carolina. 
</p><p>
I shall to-day write to the gentleman. Nothing as 
yet has appeared. I will take measures that he may 
hear from me the moment he arrives ; taking whatever is in the rivers, and taking possession of the 
rivers themselves, while the main body defends the 
Bay; forming a junction of land forces at a convenient and safe point ; checking the enemy, but giving 
nothing to chance, until properly reenforced. This is 
the plan I mean to propose. Some days ago I sent 
Washington to contrive the Maryland new levies out 
of their State. These Marylanders will be five hundred ; Virginians, four hundred ; Pennsylvanians, six 
hundred ; light infantry, eight hundred and fifty ; 
dragoons, one hundred and twenty. Such is the Continental force ; and in the course of eight days the 
already called for militia will make three thousand. 
Every thing I put at the lowest estimate ; but we 
may depend upon two thousand five hundred Continentals, rank and file, exclusive of artillery, and three, 
or, if more are wanted, four thousand miUtia. Maryland would send six hundred militia at least. I have 
two hundred more dragoons and horses ready, and am 
waiting for accoutrements. 
</p><p>
There is such a confusion in affairs in this part of 
the world, that immense difficulties are found for a 
perfect formation of magazines. I have, however, 
strongly urged the matter. The moment I received 
your first letter, I sent Mr. McHenry to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, 
who had long conversations about it with the Governor and Council. I have recommended such plans 
as might answer your purposes. This State has a 
large quantity of beef, corn, some flour, very little 
rum. Maryland ought to be early called upon. Water transportation will, I hope, ease our difficulties. 
Had we any thing like money, matters would go on 
very well. The dry season has rendered most of the 
mills useless. We have no clothing of any sort ; no 
heavy artillery in order. Some arms will be wanting, 
some horse accoutrements, and a great deal of ammunition. Nothing but your own entreaties may have a 
sufficient quantity of those articles transported to 
the head of the Bay. In the present state of affairs, 
my dear General, I hope you will come yourself to 
Virginia, and that, if the French army moves this 
way, I shall have, at least, the satisfaction of beholding you myself at the head of the combined armies ; 
in which case I beg leave to recommend you may 
be accompanied by the heads of departments, which 
will save you an immense deal of trouble. The men 
we have here would not be equal to the task of a 
campaign upon so large a scale. 
</p><p>
In two days I will write again to your Excellency, 
and keep you particularly and certainly informed, unless something is done the very moment, and it will 
probably be difficult. Lord Cornwallis must be attacked with a pretty great apparatus. But when a 
French fleet takes possession of the Bay and rivers, 
and we form a land force superior to his, that army 
must, soon or late, be forced to surrender, as we may 
get what reenforcements we please. Adieu, my dear 
General. I heartily thank you for having ordered me 
to remain in Virginia; and to your goodness to me 
I am owing the most beautiful prospect I may ever 
behold. With the most affectionate respect, I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
