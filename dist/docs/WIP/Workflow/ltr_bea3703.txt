Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Last night, I had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor of yesterday, inclosing a copy of a 
Council of War, held the 6th. I will endeavour, 
agreeably to your Excellency's request, to transmit 
my opinion on the matters submitted, by the time 
required. I sincerely wish the situation of our affairs 
would admit ni}'- giving it with more decision than I 
am able to do at present. 
</p><p>
The order, contained in the postscript of your Excellency's letter of the 7th, to send the eight bargemen 
of Colonel Putnam's regiment to join their regiment, 
I conceive to be on a supposition of their being idle 
at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>. I beg leave to observe, that they are 
now employed as my bargemen ; that all the militia 
oarsmen had, previous to the receipt of the order, 
been drafted, and sent to different commands, at 
King's Ferry and elsewhere, so that it is out of my 
power to procure a proper crew for my barge ; for 
which reasons I have thought proper to detain them 
until I receive your Excellency's further orders on 
the subject. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of inclosing extracts of a letter from Colonel Hay, of the 9th, respecting flour, &c. 
I sincerely wish he may succeed in his endeavours to procure flour (of which I am very doubtful) in the 
quantities he has requested, as I believe the requisition larger than (when all others are answered) the 
State can comply with. 
</p><p>
About thirty bateau-men, mentioned in Colonel 
Hay's letter, were sent down with Captain Denny to 
King's Ferry. As, in case of an evacuation of these 
posts. Colonel Livingston's garrison, with the troops 
sent down, will be sufficient to man the bateaux, I 
think it will be best to order the bateau-men to be 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. Your Excellency's general orders of 
the 28th and 30th ultimo, from the Adjutant-General, 
were received last evening, and published in my orders of this day. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
