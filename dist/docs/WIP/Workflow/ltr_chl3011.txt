DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The recommendation of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a></a>, which you 
transmitted to me ; threw the officers to whom. I communicated it into so great a flame of discontent, that 
I ventured, notwithstanding your orders, to hesitate. 
They accused him of partiality to his connections and 
townsmen, to the prejudice of men of manifestly superior merit. Indeed, it appears, from the concurrent 
testimony of unbiased persons, that some of the subjects he recommended were wretched. In short, I 
was so stunned with their clamor, that I delayed till 
the arrival of the Committee, for which I ought to 
ask your pardon. But, at the same time, I think the 
delay has been salutary. 
</p><p>
My objections to moving from our present post 
are, as I observed before, that it would give us the 
air of being frightened; it would expose a fine fertile 
country to their ravages ; and I must add, that we 
are as secure as we could be in any position what 
ever. We are pretty well disencumbered of our impediments, which I propose depositing in or about 
Crompond, which (though I confess I have not reconnoitred the place), from its situation, must be full as 
safe, and is much more centrical than <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. If, on further examination, it has any material disadvantages, we can easily move from thence. 
</p><p>
As to ourselves, light as we are, several retreats 
present themselves. In short, if we keep a good 
look out, we are in no danger; but I must entreat 
your Excellency to enjoin the officers posted at Fort 
Lee to give us the quickest intelligence, if they observe any embarkations of troops in the North River. 
Our scouts are of late grown more vigilant, and make 
prisoners. The militia, according to their laudable 
custom, would not stay a moment beyond their usual 
time. Oh, General, why would you be overpersuaded 
by men of inferior judgment to your own? It was 
a cursed affair. 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=daw" rel="me">CHARLES LEE</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The returns of the soldiers of the different 
regiments now in the hands of the enemy, according 
to the mode you require, are not yet made out, but 
will soon, and shall be sent.
