SIR, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a fruitless pursuit of the 
French squadron. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will inform your Excellency of the fatal determination of the Count's 
officers in a Council of War, as well as of the several 
remonstrances, and final solemn protest, made by the 
American Generals. The Admiral's ship being dismantled, fore and aft, at the moment he had overtaken 
the British fleet, and was promising himself an important victory, another ship of the line being in 
like manner dismantled, and a seventy-four gun ship 
being separated from the squadron, all the effects 
of a most dreadful storm which suddenly arose, were 
regarded as sufficient reasons, added to the expectation of Admiral Byron's arrival, for abandoning the 
American troops in the midst of a very important expedition, and reducing them to the necessity of making a desperate attack or a precipitate retreat. 
</p><p>
The honor of the French nation, the honor of the 
Admiral, the safety of his fleet, and a regard for the 
new alliance, required a different conduct ; but the 
Count's hands were tied. The cabal of marine officers, who wish his destruction because he was introduced from the land service into their corps, left 
him, it is said, no choice. I cannot, however, but be 
of opinion, that a solemn protest might, by affording a justification for his acting in direct contradiction to 
the unanimous voice of his officers, have induced him to remain here. lie might have been furnished, at 
this place, with all the means of refitting which he 
can expect at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. lie might have been as well 
secured against a superior force ; and, in case he had 
chosen to fight, he would have been in better condition in still water, with dismantled vessels, where 
every one knows that, with springs upon his cables, 
he might fight his artillery as well as if he had 
masts and sails ; whereas, at sea, in case of a separation from his fleet, the Languedoc may fall a prey 
to a vessel of half her force. 
As I find that I am detaining the express, and I 
am sure <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will have written your Excellency more fully than my present hurry and con 
fusion of ideas, for want of sleep, will permit me to 
do, I must entreat your Excellency's excuse for closing my letter abruptly. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
