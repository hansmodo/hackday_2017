MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I HAVE passed through the ceremonial of taking leave 
of the States General, the prince and princess, &c., 
to the satisfaction of all parties, and have been feasted 
at court, and all that ; made my compliments to the 
prince on the 8th of March, his birth day, and to the 
princess at her drawing room, &c., &c., &c., and 
should have been in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> at this hour, if you 
had not laid a plot which has brought me to this 
town. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, at the receipt of your letter, 
came post to meet me, and he cuts out so much business for me, to put the money matters of the United 
States upon a sure footing, that I certainly shall not 
be able to get into the packet at Helvoet before Saturday, and I much fear not before Wednesday, the 
nineteenth. This delay is very painful to me, and you must blame yourself for it altogether. I thought 
myself dead, and that it was well over with me 
as a public man ; but I think I shall be forced, after 
my decease, to open an additional loan. At least, 
this is <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>'s opinion and that of Mr. Van Staphorst. 
</p><p>
1 hope you will have every thing ready, that by 
the twenty-first or second of March, we may set off 
together for Falmouth from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. My love to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and kiss my dear boy. Compliments 
to all friends. I am very impatient under this unforeseen delay ; but our bankers, as well as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, think it absolutely necessary for the public. 
I must, therefore, submit ; but if, in consequence of 
it, you should meet southwesters on the coast of 
America, and have your voyage prolonged three 
weeks by it, remember it is all your own intrigue 
which has forced me to open this loan. I suppose 
you will boast of it as a great public service. 
Yours forever, 
</p><p>
