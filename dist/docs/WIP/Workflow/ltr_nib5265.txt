My dear sir 
</p><p>
In regard to the bonus for a renewal of the Charter my views are these 
</p><p>
As the bonus is in fact only another name for a tax, and like all other taxes disables the Bank to the extent of it from 
giving facilities to the community, a Bonus should not be 
pressed by Gov 4 beyond a very moderate limit, particularly 
as the Gov* is now very rich instead of being needy as it was 
at the time of granting the Charter. 
</p><p>
But if the Bank must pay, I do not think it ought to pay 
more than the sum of $1,500,000: nevertheless it would not 
be proper to decline the charter because more was asked &amp; I 
should be disposed to go as high as two millions or if necessary three; between this last limit &amp; the original sum of a 
million &amp; a half lies the debateable ground. I think you might 
at once agree to any sum not exceeding three millions. If 
more were required or more were insisted upon during the 
passage of the Bill through the House it would be a subject 
of further reference to the Board. To the extent I have mentioned, I am sure there would be no difficulty.
