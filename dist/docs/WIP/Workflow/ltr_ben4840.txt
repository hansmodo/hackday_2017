DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Permit me to thank you, not only on my own Account for 
the Book itself you have so kindly sent me, but in Behalf 
of the Publick for Writing it: It being in my Opinion consider? the profound Study, & steady Application of Mind 
that the Work required, & the sound Judgment with which 
it is executed, and its great and important Utility to the Nation, 
the foremost Production of human Understanding, that this 
Century has afforded us. With great & sincere Esteem I am, my dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>
B. F.
