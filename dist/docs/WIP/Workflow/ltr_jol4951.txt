My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I enclose you a packet which I received from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yesterday. You will be so good as to forward those letters which Mr. Manning commits 
to my care. The two letters which I have kept out of the bundle are one from Mr. Laurens, containing nothing new, and one for Anthony Butler, Esq., D. Q. M. G., which Gov. Johnston desires me to take charge of. 
</p><p>
The commissioners ventured out yesterday as far as German Town with an escort of light troops, which with the number that have crossed into the Jerseys, 
left only 800 men in the city according to the account of a very intelligent deserter. Every account confirms the opinion that s'r H. Clinton is throwing 
his men over the Delaware by degrees, and that the remainder are constantly under marching orders. 
</p><p>
The grenadiers have crossed the river, and the Anspachers have embarked. 
</p><p>
The packet addressed to yourself and Congress, you 
will observe is sealed with the fond picture of a 
mother caressing her children. I am of opinion that 
the commissioners hope to do more by addressing 
themselves to individuals than public bodies. But 
what prospect can they have of succeeding in the 
least of their views. They must, I think, retire disgracefully, for I am persuaded that Congress will not 
lose sight of those well chosen land-marks which they 
declare they mean to steer by. The honour and interest of the nation, and the sacred regard which is due 
to treaties, unite to make us reject their overtures. 
From their conduct, one would think that they have 
as little opinion of our virtue and understanding, as 
they formerly had of our courage. It is our duty 
to convince them how much we have been calumniated in every respect, and to render their superior subtilty in negociations of as little avail as their 
greater experience in the art of war. I begin to regard Johnston as an apostate to the cause of liberty, and to place him among the number of those whose 
secret wish is rather a change of men than measures. 
The nominating him as a commissioner, and vesting 
him and his colleagues with a power of making governors, are strokes of artful policy, against which 
we cannot be too much on our guard. His reputation as a friend to America, his patriotic speeches in the House of Commons, will be made the themes of many a letter and discourse for seducing incautious citizens. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father.
