DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The honorable command given me lately by Congress, would have been very agreeable, if I had not 
conceived the war to be near the close. You may remember, in the last conversation I had with your Excellency, I gave my reasons fully for declining any command in the army. 
</p><p>
It is no small mortification to me, that, by not entering early into the service, I lost the opportunity 
of sharing the honors which many officers have gained by serving under your command. 
</p><p>
The civilities I received from you, whilst I remained in your family at camp, will ever be remembered 
with gratitude ; and if our affairs should again take 
an unfortunate turn, be assured you have not a friend 
more ready than I shall be to share your dangers. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely wish you may live to see the 
liberties of your country established upon the broadest foundation ; which I know has ever been your only object, from the beginning of this contest. I 
am, clear Sir, with the greatest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
