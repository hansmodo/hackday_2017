Sir, 
</p><p>
It may be proper that I report to your Excellency 
the circumstances and events of my late journey to 
<a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. I was unable to leave camp the 2d 
instant until late in the afternoon, which prevented 
my reaching <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> till the evening. 
</p><p>
I immediately waited on the Intendant with Count Chastellux's letter, reciting the agreement he had 
made with me respecting the future employment of 
the vessels, and desiring him to pay me two thousand dollars on account of their services. The Intendant declined doing it, but proposed to see me 
the next morning, when he would get an interpreter, 
that we might fully understand one another. I met 
him at sunrise ; but, after a long conversation, he 
finally refused a compliance, in any respect, with the 
agreement of Count Chastellux. He observed, that 
neither Count Chastellux, as Major-General, nor Count 
Rochambeau, as Commander-in-chief, had a right to 
make any agreements obligatory on him ; that he had 
been constantly disappointed, in every undertaking of 
Government, from Hhode Island to Virginia ; that he was answerable with his head, if the King's army were not duly supplied; that money insured supplies; 
and that he could depend on nothing but the direct 
application of it by his own agents. I was now 
fearful that the proposed plan must be wholly given 
up. But afterwards I concerted measures with Colonel Wads worth and Mr. Carter for prosecuting it, and, 
by their assistance, have been enabled to do it for 
the present. On my arriving at Trebel's Landing, I 
found many vessels unfit for service. These, exceeding twenty in number, I discharged. All the others 
that were unloaded were formed into squadrons for 
different ports, to bring supplies to the army. Most 
of them sailed yesterday morning. 
</p><p>
Commodore Barron arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> just 
in time to go with me to the Landing ; yet, with his 
assistance, I was not able to arrange the vessels, 
finish the unloading of some, furnish them with provisions, and write their various orders, till yesterday 
morning. A competent number will call on the Count de Grasse to land the marines at the place your Excellency directed, if this should not have been already 
effected ; for Commodore Barron informed that before 
he left the fleet, the Admiral intended to land them 
without delay. 
</p><p>
There is one vessel at the Landing, which came 
from Rhode Island with salted provisions, which yet 
remain unloaded. I do not know the quantity she 
has on board, but I believe not above a hundred or 
a hundred and fifty barrels. If there be no material 
objection, I would have it landed, that the vessel 
might be discharged, or employed in transporting 
supplies. At present she serves only as a storehouse 
for that small quantity of provisions, at the rent of 
two thousand five hundred and fifty-five a year. 
I trouble your Excellency with this information, because Colonel Stewart, some days since, suggested that 
it was your Excellency's desire, that this salted meat 
should be preserved for some special occasions, and 
that it was necessary to have it remain on board. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
