Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 5th inst in which you apprize me that you had been 
informed that the Stockholders of the U.S. Bank would accept a charter from this State and you request to know from 
me on what terms this can be effected especially mentioning the number of years of the charter with which the Bank 
would be satisfied the amount of capital as well as the premium &amp; other encouragements that would be given to 
the State in consideration of it. 
</p><p>
Having long had reflected much on this subject, I will answer promptly &amp; without reserve. 
</p><p>
For a variety of reasons, which I forbear to state because 
your duties have made you familiar with them, I believe it to 
be of the greatest importance to our State to appropriate to 
its own benefit the Capital of the Bank of the U.S. which is 
about to be distributed &amp; can never be recalled if it once 
leaves the State. 
</p><p>
I believe that considering the general growth of the whole 
Union and the extraordinary resources of Penn a which 
require only capital to develope them the sum of ten mil 
lions which formed the capital of the first Bank in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a> 
and the sum of 35 millions which formed the capital of the 
present Bank in <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a> was not more than the equivalent of 
TOO millions at this time and that the present institution 
might with great safety &amp; with great advantage be gradually 
increased to fifty millions to an amount not disproportionate 
</p><p>
of securing a charter from the State of Pennsylvania. Clarke was a co-worker of 
Peter Force and aided the latter in collecting and publishing the former's great 
work American Archives, a Documentary History of the English Colonies of North 
America. On October 30, <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, Clarke wrote to Biddle as follows: "I need only 
give the outline of what I consider a splendid operation. Only remember / have 
given it. Let our State of Pennsylvania charter the U.S. Bank, less the Gov* Stock 
and in place of Branches, out of the State create Agencies or whatever you 
please to call them. . . . Let the State lay out the Bonus in Internal Improvements 
and make yourself a name &amp; praise among the nations of the Earth. " 
</p><p>
This suggestion evidently impressed Biddle as the above letter and the following actions of the Bank disclose. Moreover, the economic and political aspect 
of the State favored the Bank men at this particular time. Pennsylvania was al 
ready engulfed in the vast internal improvement speculation which characterized . 
these years and was just beginning to feel the effects of her folly. With her commerce sinking beneath the pecuniary agitation of the thirties, her treasury bankrupt, and her citizens overburdened with taxes, the Pennsylvania Legislature was 
willing to listen to Nicholas Biddle. Furthermore, the Anti-Masonic Party had 
elected their man, Joseph Ritner, as governor upon an implied promise not to in 
crease the debt nor the taxes, and as the Whigs and Anti-Masons had been voting 
together on all measures since <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> under the able leadership of Thaddeus Stevens, Biddle might well deem the time propitious when it is considered how large a sum could be used for the 
general purposes of trade, manufactures &amp; agriculture how much might be advanced to the State for the completion 
of its great Plans of improvement how large a portion 
might be given to private associations for rail roads &amp; canals 
&amp; other objects of general benefit &amp; how much might be judiciously advanced to individuals in the interior for improvements which tho private in their nature are public in their 
results. I believe that to give permanancy &amp; solidity to the 
fiscal arrangements of the State it would be greatly for its 
interest to extend the charter to thirty years. 
</p><p>
I have accordingly endeavored to estimate the value of such 
a charter &amp; I have made up my mind to this conclusion 
which I mention to you at once because I have not the 
least ambition to make any arrangement not mutually advantageous &amp; because after all the benefit of this measure to 
the Commonwealth in its schemes of improvement is far 
greater than the mere price which may be paid for the charter. The question you will perceive is, what inducement * 
can be offered to the Stockholders in other parts of the U.S. 
or in Europe to leave his funds in Penn a . rather than take 
them home to be employed in other States and then what 
reason can be given for accepting a charter from Penn a rather 
from any other of the 24 States having an equal with Penn a 
to give the charter. As a Pennsylvanian devotedly attached 
to her interests &amp; her fame I would give more to Penn a . than 
to any other State for a Charter and my effort would be to 
induce all the other Stockholders to prefer that arrangement to either a division of the funds or the acceptance of a 
charter from any other State. To do which it would be necessary to render the terms beneficial to the State yet not too 
burdensome to the Stockholder.* 
</p><p>
For a charter from Penn a . for the amount of Stock held 
by individuals with a power of gradual increase to fifty mil 
lions of dollars, and for thirty years, I would recommend to 
the Stockholders the following terms. 
</p><p>
To give to the State $2,000,000 either in cash on the day 
when the charter was accepted, or in instalments one fourth 
cash &amp; the rest in equal payments at six twelve &amp; 1 8 
months, the sum of 2,000,000. To lend to the State when 
ever wanted six millions of dollars taking their Stock, which 
need not be repaid before the expiration of the charter, at 
five per cent, which interest payable semi annually &amp; giving 
a premium of ten per cent or if more agreeable to take a 
four per cent stock at par. 
</p><p>
To subscribe the sum of one million to the stock of any 
rail roads or canal companies which the State might elect as 
worthy of particular patronage and 
</p><p>
To advance at all times to the State a temporary loan of 
Five hundred thousand at five per cent 
</p><p>
Allow me in conclusion to suggest one very important consideration. It is this. The charter of the Bank expires on the 
4th of March. The Stockholders are already summoned to 
meet on the iy th of February to make preparations for the 
dissolution of the Bank &amp; some final decision will probably 
be then made for either the division of the funds or an application for a charter from some other authority. It would 
therefore be highly desirable that the final action of the legislature should be known at that period, so that an immediate acceptance of the charter may be made or ulterior measures be adopted. 
</p><p>
I need not say that in this frank exposition I speak only 
my own sentiments I believe such an arrangement would 
be beneficial to the State and as such it might be offered &amp; 
would be accepted. 
</p><p>
* As far as I understand the financial position of the State 
is that a large amount of funds is invested in improvements 
/which do not yet defray their own expenses, but will do so when 
j the whole scheme of improvements is finished. It is desirable 
therefore to make arrangements for the completion of the 
I improvements and until they become more productive to sup- 
l ply the deficiency of income over expenditure. Both these objects would I think be attained by the following arrangement.
