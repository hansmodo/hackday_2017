MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
VIVE la bagatelle ! Dulce est desipere. I have no 
other resource in my solitude amidst all my gloomy 
forebodings of the future miseries of my beloved 
species. Our allies, our only allies, as the demi crazies pathetically call them, have completed their system by turning all their churches into Je ne seals quoi, 
and if they should have any government erected 
among them either by themselves or others, they may 
substitute choruses of boys and girls to chant prayers 
like the Romans 
<block>
" Hie bellum lacrimosum, hie miseram famera 
Pestemque, a populo et principe Caesare, in 
Persas atque Britannos 
</p><p>
Vestra motus aget prece." 
</block>
Their prayers will probably be heard, and war, 
pestilence and famine may be ready to seize the 
Austrians and Britons as soon as they have satiated 
themselves with havock in France. I hope, however, 
that the awful example of that country, whether it 
shall be like to those of Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and 
Gomorrah, or whether it shall terminate less fatally, 
will be a warning to all other nations and to ours 
especially. The Britons and Spaniards, by taking the 
West India Islands, and attempting to hold them, will 
only lay foundations for future wars to restore them. 
In short, I see no end of war. It is a comfort to reflect that they can do no greater evil than put an end 
to their lives. 
</p><p>
What think the clergy of New England ? What 
says Mr. Wibird? Do they still admire the French 
republicans ? Do they think them virtuous ? Do 
they wish to see them imitated by all nations ? Do 
they wish to resign all their salaries, and to have 
their churches all turned into riding houses, the 
Sabbath abolished, and one day in ten substituted 
to sing songs to the manes of Marat ? O, my soul, 
come not thou into the secrets of such republicans! 
The guillotine itself would not make me a sincere re 
publican upon such conditions. 
</p><p>
The spirit, principles and system of rational liberty 
to all nations, is my toast ; but I see no tendency to 
any thing but anarchy, licentiousness and despotism. 
Mankind will not learn wisdom from experience. 
Yours, affectionately, 
</p><p>
