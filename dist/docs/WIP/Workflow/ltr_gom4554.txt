Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany the duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the seventh by the packet. I am still waiting for 
intelligence from the Ministers, who (to judge by appearances) 
slumber profoundly upon the application made to them. Yesterday the two houses of Parliament again entered on business, 
after their recess for the Easter holidays ; and Mr Pitt has 
announced the budget for next Monday. Some rational con 
jectures, as to their dispositions and intentions, may perhaps be 
formed from the business of that day. I have the honor to 
be, &c.
