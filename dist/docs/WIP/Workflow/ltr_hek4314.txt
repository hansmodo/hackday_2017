Sir, 
I have the honor to submit herein, inclosed, a letter to the Governor of Georgia, and one to Mr. Seagrove ; the former draughted by the Attorney-General, 
and both approved by the same, and the Secretary 
of the Treasury. The principles you were pleased to 
suggest have been the basis of these papers. The 
manner of treating the Spaniards and McGillivray, 
was unanimously considered as the most proper to be 
adopted in the present conjuncture. One of the 
Spanish Commissioners is at present in Virginia, and 
the other in the country, but will return either today or to-morrow. I shall see him, and, conformably 
to the advice of the gentlemen, mention the affair 
verbally and informally; the result of which I will 
have the honor to transmit to you. 
</p><p>
Letters have just been received from Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>. All quiet. He has transmitted his ideas of 
the further progress of the war, in case the negotiations should fail, which shall be transmitted by the 
next post. I have directed that the express be furnished with one hundred dollars, out of which he 
will return the money you were pleased to advance 
him. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
