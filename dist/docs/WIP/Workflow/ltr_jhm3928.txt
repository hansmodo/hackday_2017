SIR: 
</p><p>
Those gentlemen who have for some time been so much indisposed, 
as to prevent their attendance in Council, having recovered their health, 
enabled me yesterday to convene a Council, when I laid before them 
your letter respecting the propriety of altering the mode of punishment 
for persons carrying on a clandestine trade with the enemy, from that 
pointed out by my proclamation of the 14th March last, to that pointed 
out under the Sedition Act; when, after mature deliberation, the 
Council were of opinion that an alteration in the mode of punishment 
would by no means be advisable at this juncture; but, at the same 
time, earnestly recommended that the proclamation before mentioned 
should be carried vigorously into execution, which, in their opinion, 
was very well calculated to put a stop to that iniquitous commerce. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
