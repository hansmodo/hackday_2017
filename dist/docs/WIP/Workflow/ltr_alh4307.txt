I am much obliged to your Excellency for the explicit manner in which you contradict the insinuations 
mentioned in my last letter. The only use I shall 
make of your answer, will he to put it into the hands 
of a few friends. 
</p><p>
The Constitution proposed has, in this State, warm 
friends and warm enemies. The first impressions 
every where are in its favor; but the artillery of its 
opponents makes some impression. The event cannot 
yet be foreseen. The inclosed is the first number of 
a series of papers to be written in its defence. 
</p><p>
I send you also, at the request of the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a>, a printed pamphlet, containing the grounds of 
an application lately made to Congress. He tells me 
there is some reference to you, the object of which he 
does not himself seem clearly to understand; but imagines it may be in your power to be of service to 
him. There are public considerations that induce me 
to be somewhat anxious for his success. He is fortified with materials which, in Europe, could not fail to 
establish the belief of the contract he alleges. The 
documents of service he possesses are of a nature to 
convey an exalted idea of them. The compensations 
he has received, though considerable, if compared 
with those which have been received by American 
officers, will, according to European ideas, be very 
scanty in application to a stranger who is acknowledged to have rendered essential services. Our reputation abroad is not, at present, too high. To dismiss an old soldier, empty and hungry, to seek the 
bounty of those on whom he has no claims, and to complain of unkind returns and violated engagements, 
will certainly not tend to raise it. I confess, too, 
there is something in my feelings which would incline 
me, in this case, to go farther than might be strictly 
necessary, rather than drive a man, at the Baron's 
time of life, who has been a faithful servant, to extremities. And this is unavoidable, if he does not 
succeed in his present attempt. What he asks would, 
all calculations made, terminate in this, â€” an allowance 
of his five hundred and fifty guineas a year. He 
only wishes a recognition of the contract. He knows 
that, until affairs mend, no money can be produced. 
I do not know how far it may be in your power 
to do him any good ; but I shall be mistaken if the 
considerations I have mentioned do not appear to 
your Excellency to have some weight. I remain, 
with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant,
