SlR, 
</p><p>
Last evening Colonel Porter delivered me your letter of the 4th instant, to which I have paid all the attention the importance of it demands. 
</p><p>
This Colony, the last fall, not confiding entirely in 
the precarious supply of powder that might be expected from the merchants, imported a considerable quantity, though not so large as was ordered. The supplying the inhabitants, who were in a manner utterly 
destitute, the army near <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and our armed vessels, has so exhausted this stock, that the powder now left, which is all in this place, is greatly insufficient to resist even a short attack upon it. Our situation is the same with respect to lead. So that at present none of either article can be spared from the Colony. 
</p><p>
By a vessel, which arrived here on the 30th ultimo from Cape Francois, we are informed that the 
captain of the vessel, sent from this port to the 
Cape for a quantity of warlike stores, in which the 
Committee of Safety for the Colony of the Massachusetts had interested themselves, had executed his 
commission, and was to sail with a large quantity in 
a day or two, so that she may be hourly expected. 
This Colony, about four weeks ago, despatched a 
suitable vessel with money to purchase fifteen tons 
of powder and other warlike stores, which may also 
soon be expected. Of these vessels we have the 
highest reason to think the enemy have gained intelligence ; the ships of war upon this station having for several days past cruised continually off Block Island, and from thence to Montauk Point, and up the Sound. 
</p><p>
This hath made us think it absolutely necessary to 
send the smallest of our armed sloops to cruise with 
out the ships of war, and endeavour, at all hazards, 
to speak with the vessels expected with powder, and 
order them to another port. She will sail this day. 
The other armed sloop, by being within the river, 
prevents the cutters and barges from committing depredations, so that she cannot be spared; nor, indeed, 
is a vessel of her force required for the enterprise 
you mention. 
</p><p>
We have, in this harbour, a very fine sailing packet 
that would answer the purpose extremely well ; which 
might be equipped with swivels, manned with about 
twenty men, and be ready to sail in less than two 
days. But as I do not think it prudent that her sole 
dependence should be upon getting powder at Bermuda, it will be necessary to send a sum of money 
to purchase a quantity at some other port, in case 
of a disappointment at Bermuda. In the present state 
of the Colony, I do not think it probable that a 
sufficient sum can be procured here for that purpose 
before the sitting of the General Assembly ; and there 
fore advise that application be made to the General 
Court of the Massachusetts Bay to advance part of 
the sum necessary. I believe we may be able to 
supply one half the sum here. Colonel Porter hath 
been at Bedford, and along the Eastern Shore, but 
can hear nothing of Harris. He is now bound as far 
as New London, to endeavour to meet with him; but 
is greatly apprehensive that he is fallen into the 
hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
We have information that several ships of war and 
transports were, the day before yesterday, at New London; and that the country round were alarmed 
and mustering. We also hear that they have taken some stock off the east end of Long Island. 
</p><p>
Sensible of the great scarcity of lead in the country, I some time ago wrote to the Congress of the 
Massachusetts Bay, and to our delegates at the Continental Congress, recommending that a part of the 
large quantity of lead at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> should be immediately brought down; and still think the measure necessary. 
</p><p>
I shall immediately give orders to the Committee 
of Safety to purchase, for the use of the Colony, all 
the tow-cloth that can be had. 
</p><p>
If the powder, supposed to be at Bermuda, be private property, it must be immediately paid for. If 
not, I imagine it will be settled with our other disputes. This is a matter that ought to be known and provided for. 
</p><p>
Upon further consideration, I am very doubtful 
whether a vessel can be immediately provided with 
men here ; and therefore am of opinion that twenty-five or thirty sailors had better be drafted from 
the army, and held in readiness to embark immediately upon the arrival of Harris. 
</p><p>
This letter waits upon you by my son, whom I beg leave to recommend to your favorable notice. I am, with very great esteem, 
</p><p>
Sir, your most obedient 
</p><p>
And most humble servant, 
</p><p>
