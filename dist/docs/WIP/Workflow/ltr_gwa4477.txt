Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The late accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are mysterious and perplexing, but they at any rate demand that we should be in readiness to move. You will therefore 
concentrate as much as possible your brigade, and put 
them under marching orders. The parties at the Clove 
are not to be immediately called in, but the officers 
commanding them should be warned to be in readiness. Should an evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> take place, 
as many strongly suspect, the troops under your command will be next in order for detachment. You will 
therefore desire the officers to make preparation for a 
move farther than merely to join the main body of 
the army. As I am very anxious to learn what they 
are really doing in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, you will oblige me by 
obtaining and sending me as accurate intelligence as 
possible. I am, &c. 
</p>
