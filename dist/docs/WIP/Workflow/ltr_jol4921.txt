My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to enter fully into every 
part of your kind letters dated the 8th and 16th inst, 
but as that will be impossible by the present opportunity I must confine myself to thanking you for the 
information which you have given me in some 
important points, and replying briefly to several questions which you ask me : 
</p><p>
First, the Barou'd Arendt is a German, who served 
as he says in quality of aide de camp to the K. of 
Prussia ; was colonel in our service of a battalion of 
Germans and their descendants raised in Maryland 
and this State, was sent afterwards to take the command at Fort Mifflin where his ill health suffered him 
to stay but a short time. He has undoubtedly great 
military talents ; but I have heard that Gen'l Muhlenberg, who commanded the brigade to which the German 
regiment is attached, and the officers of the regiment, call the baron's probity into question. His Excellency has neither seen nor heard any thing of this gentleman that could give him an unfavourable opinion of him. 
</p><p>
We have never had any particular account of the prizes in the Delaware. One or two of those taken 
on the Jersey shore, from their vicinity to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> yielded but little profit to the captors, as they 
were obliged to burn them before they could unload them. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Neuville with his brother and companions sets out for York to-morrow. I take the 
Cheval'r to be a gentleman whose thirst for glory, and whose military knowledge would make him an acquisition to the army of the United States. The younger 
brother as far as I can judge from his appearance, tho inferior in knowledge, is animated with sentiments that characterize the soldier. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress respecting <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a> and his army, I think both founded in justice 
and policy. It might have been better perhaps if a little more republican laconism had been used in explaining the reasons for it. 
</p><p>
The letter said to be the general's is partly genuine 
and partly spurious. Those who metamorphosed the 
intercepted original committed an error in point of 
time, for Mrs. Washington was with the general in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at the date of it. 
</p><p>
You asked me, my dear father, what bounds I have 
set to my desire of serving my country in the military 
line ? I answer glorious death, or the triumph of the 
cause in which we are engaged. 
</p><p>
I must not conclude without giving you a short 
account of a brilliant defence lately made by a few of 
Cap* Lee's troop. Near two hundred of the enemy's 
light dragoons made an attempt to surprise the captain 
in his quarters. They concealed their march by a 
circuitous road, and arrived at the house a little after 
day-break conducted by an intelligent guide. Lee 
had at the time with him only his lieutenant, Mr. Lindsay, a corporal and four privates, and Major Jameson of the same regiment who happen'd to be 
there on a visit. They posted themselves in the 
house and made the necessary preparations for defence. 
Capt. Delancy, who commanded the enemy's advanced 
guard, led it on bravely till he arrived under cover of 
the eves, while the main body kept up a constant fire 
from a distance on the windows. After repeated 
efforts had been made to enter the house, the party 
repulsed made an attempt to seize the horses which 
were in the stable, but such a well directed constant 
fire was kept up from the house that the bravest dragoon did not venture to dismount. The loss of the 
enemy was one commissioned officer and three or four 
privates. The party in its retreat picked up a quarter-master's serjeant and a couple of videttes. Lieutenant Lindsay was wounded in the hand. Too much 
praise cannot be bestowed upon the officers and men 
</p><p>
who had the honor of forcing such an incomparable 
superiority of numbers to a shameful retreat. Capt. Nichols was at Lee's quarters in his way from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> during the action, and gives our little party 
great applause as I have been told. 
</p><p>
We have some as brave individuals among our 
officers as any that exist. Our men are the best 
crude materials for soldiers I believe in the world, for 
they possess a docility and patience which astonish 
foreigners. "With a little more discipline we should 
drive the haughty Briton to his ships. 
</p><p>
I am unhappy in hearing that your leg continues so 
weak, and wish that I could offer my shoulder as a 
support; but at this distance, I can only help you by 
my prayers, and comfort by assurances of sympathy. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
