MY DEAR General, 
</p><p>
It is with the utmost concern that I hear my letters have not come to hand, and, while I lament the 
miscarriage, I hope you do not impute it to any 
fault on my part. In these times of troubles, it has 
become more difficult to know or to reach opportunities ; and how this will be carried, I leave to the care 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>, who goes to London. 
Our revolution is getting on as well as it can, with 
a nation that has swallowed liberty at once, and is 
still liable to mistake licentiousness for freedom. The 
Assembly have more hatred to the ancient system 
than experience on the proper organization of a new 
and Constitutional Government. The Ministers are 
lamenting their loss of power, and afraid to use that 
which they have ; and, as every thing has been destroyed, and not much new building is yet above 
ground, there is much room for critics and calumnies. 
To this may be added, that we still are pestered by 
two parties; the aristocratic, that is panting for a 
counter revolution, and the factious, which aims at 
the division of the empire, and destruction of all 
authority, and perhaps of the lives of the reigning 
branch; both of which parties are fomenting troubles. 
</p><p>
And after I have confessed all this, my dear General, I will tell you, with the same candor, that we 
have made an admirable and almost incredible destruction of all abuses and prejudices; that every thing 
not directly useful to, or coming from, the people, 
has been levelled; that in the topographical, moral, 
political situation of France, we have made more 
changes in ten months than the most sanguine patriot could have imagined; that our internal troubles 
and anarchy are much exaggerated ; and that, upon 
the whole, this revolution, in which nothing will be 
wanting but energy of government, just as it was in 
America, will propagate and implant liberty, and make 
it flourish throughout the world, while we must wait 
for a Convention in a few years to mend some defects, which are not now perceived by men just escaped from aristocracy and despotism. 
</p><p>
You know that the Assembly have adjourned the 
West India affairs, leaving every j;hing in the actual 
state; namely, the ports opened, as we hear they 
have been, to American trade. But it was impossible, 
circumstanced as we are, to take a definitive resolve 
on that matter. The ensuing Legislature will more 
easily determine, after they have received the demands of . the Colonies, who have been invited to 
make them, particularly on the objects of victualling. 
Give me leave, my dear General, to present you 
with a picture of the Bastille, just as it looked a few 
days after I had ordered its demolition, with the 
main key of the fortress of despotism. It is a tribute, which I owe as a son to my adoptive flither, 
as an Aid-de-camp to my General, as a missionary of 
liberty to its patriarch. Adieu, my beloved General. 
My most affectionate respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Present me most affectionately to George, to Hamilton, Knox, Harrison, Humphreys, and all friends. 
Most tenderly and respectfully. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate and filial friend,
