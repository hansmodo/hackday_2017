Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday I was favoured with your friendly letter of 1st July. . 
</p><p>
To whatever cause the suspension of our correspondence may have been owing, I am persuaded that it did not 
originate cither with you or with me. How far my conjectures on that subject may be well founded, will be ascertained when we meet. 
</p><p>
Had your reason for retiring been less urgent than that of 
ill health, I should have thought it premature. While government remains relaxed, and the laws have yet to acquire 
a due degree of respect and obedience, men of talents, 
weight, and influence should exert themselves to establish 
and maintain constitutional authority and subordination. 
</p><p>
No less wisdom and perseverance is necessary to preserve and secure what we have gained, than were requisite 
in the acquisition ; and experience informs us that internal 
commotions and confusion are as injurious to the peace and 
happiness of society, as war and enemies from abroad. 
Well-ordered government is essential to the duration and 
enjoyment of the tranquillity and leisure you promise yourself at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, and therefore domestic as well as public 
considerations call upon you for such a degree of attention 
to these subjects as your health will admit of. 
</p><p>
I hope and expect next summer to return. Not only my 
family and my private concerns require it, but also the 
principles which led me into public life. But if, on my 
return, I find it my duty to devote more of my time to the 
public, they shall have it, though retirement is what I 
ardently desire. 
</p><p>
I am not surprised that men of certain characters should 
censure the terms of peace. There are men who view subjects only on the dark side ; there are others who find 
fault to show their discernment ; and we meet with some 
whose opinions are wholly decided by ideas of convenience 
and personal politics. I am happy, however, to hear that 
the great majority are content. In the opinion of Europe, 
they have great reason to be so. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
