Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I have written to you often, and particularly of affairs here. The want of intelligence retards every thing ; as I have not a 
word from you since the 5th of June last, I am well nigh distracted. That I may not omit any chance of sending to 
you, I write this, though I have long and minute letters by me waiting the departure of General du Condray and 
his train, who, had I been properly and in season instructed, would before this have been with you. At present I have 
put much to the hazard to effect what I have. Enclosed you have my thoughts on naval operations, and I pray you 
send me some blank commissions, which will enable me to fit out privateers from hence without any charge to you. A 
war appears at hand, and will probably be general. All Europe have their eyes on the States of America, and are 
astonished to find month after month rolling away, without your applying to them in form. I hope such application is 
on its way. Nothing else is wanting to effect your utmost wishes. I am, with compliments to friends, and respect to the Congress, Sec.
