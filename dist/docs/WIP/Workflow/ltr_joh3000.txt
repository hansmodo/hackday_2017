SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letters, Numbers Four and Five, and two other 
letters not numbered, with the inclosures, have been 
duly received and laid before the Congress. 
</p><p>
As there are sundry matters contained in your 
letters, which are of great importance, and on which 
the Congress;, before they come to a final determination, are desirous to have the advantage of your experience and knowledge, they have appointed three 
of their members, namely, Mr. Lynch, <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a>, 
and Mr. Harrison, to wait on you, and confer with 
you and the Governors of Connecticut and Rhode 
Island, the Council of Massachusetts Bay, and the 
President of the Convention of New Hampshire, to 
whom I have wrote on the subject, by order of Congress, and such other persons as to the said Commit 
tee shall seem proper, touching the most effectual 
method of continuing, supporting, and regulating a 
Continental Army. They will set out as soon as 
possible, and expect to be with you by the 12th of 
next month. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the greatest esteem, 
Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
