My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It is a great satisfaction to me to have to acknowledge 
two of your letters, and to be allowed the hope of hearing 
from you more frequently. I should have been very sorry 
to think that I w T as wholly out of your recollection, as I frequently reflect with pleasure on the opportunity I had of 
becoming acquainted with a character which I saw so much 
reason to esteem. 
</p><p>
Mr. Gore delivered to me, a few days ago, your letter of 
introduction. He seems to be a sensible and moderate 
man, and I shall have great pleasure both in facilitating, as 
far as may depend on me, the public objects of his mission, 
and in showing him any private attention and civility 
that maybe in my power. I think he and his colleague 
will be well satisfied with the choice which has been made 
here for that commission. Both Dr. Xieoll and Mr. Ansty 
are known (in some degree) in America, the former by 
character, the latter personally; and I trust the appointment has proved the spirit in which it was made. If I do 
not deceive myself, the choice of the commissioners who 
are going to America will not be less satisfactory. Their 
names are not yet announced, but I look upon the appointment as very nearly, if not quite, fixed. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 1st of May was delivered to me two 
days ago, and I take the opportunity of this mail to answer 
it. I have the greatest pleasure in hearing from you, that 
you consider the questions which have agitated America 
since your arrival as determined. I think we always felt 
that even after the great points were adjusted, and a foundation of solid friendship laid, something must be still left for 
the operation of time and temper. Where so much heat 
has prevailed, irritation will remain among individuals, and 
will occasionally produce inconvenience and embarrassment 
to both governments. Mutual good disposition and confidence, a uniform and steady conduct in great points, and 
moderation respecting those of less importance, must ultimately surmount these difficulties, as they have already 
surmounted others which were much greater. 
</p><p>
With respect to the impressments, I am confident that 
such orders as you speak of have been more than once 
repeated. I speak from general impression, not having had 
opportunity to ascertain the fact since I received your 
letter. But I think I can answer for it that they shall be 
renewed. In this country, much of the detail of that business has fallen within my own knowledge ; and I can say 
positively, that I do not think one instance can be brought 
where a seaman has not been discharged, who could produce, I do not say proof, but any probable, or even plausible ground for supposing him a native citizen of the United 
States, or a resident there at the time of the separation from 
this country. In some instances, the conduct observed has 
been so favourable, that within the last week, before I 
received your letter, two men were discharged, one on producing a certificate of an American consul here, which did 
not recite on what grounds or from what proof it was 
given, but merely asserted the fact that the bearer was an 
American citizen ; and the other, on producing a paper 
neither certified nor attested, but purporting to be a discharge from an American regiment of militia, â€” a paper 
which, even if genuine, may, as you will easily see, have 
passed into twenty hands before it was produced here. 
</p><p>
I saw in the proceedings of the last session of the Congress, some steps taken towards a regular establishment 
for the granting certificates. If such an establishment were 
formed, with proper and sufficient checks to prevent its 
being abused, the effect would be to do away the greatest 
part of our difficulties on the subject. But I much fear that 
the ideas prevalent in America on the subject of emigration, will prevent this ever being well or satisfactorily done. 
</p><p>
I have been led into this discussion by what you say of 
the advantage which might arise from giving orders, which 
I am confident have been repeatedly given. The assurances of Mr. Liston on the subject will also, I trust, be 
such as you seem to desire. 
</p><p>
I beg you to believe that you cannot do a thing more 
agreeable to me, or, perhaps, more useful to the interest 
of both our countries, than in expressing to me at all times, 
freely and without reserve, your opinion as to the means 
of maintaining that spirit which we jointly laboured to establish. This may be a means of rendering our correspondence greatly and permanently beneficial. Agreeable to 
me it can never fail to be, while it conveys to me information of your welfare, and gives me the opportunity of 
assuring you of the very sincere esteem and regard with 
which 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, my dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most faithful and obedient humble servant,
