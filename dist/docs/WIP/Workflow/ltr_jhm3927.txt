SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of yesterday's date is just come to hand. There is but 
one way in which the negroes you mention are to be dealt with; that 
is, as they were taken in arms, they must be tried by the negro law ; 
and, if found guilty, executed, unless there are any whose cases are 
so far favorable as to induce the court to recommend them to mercy, 
and the executive authority interpose and pardon them. Exemplary 
punishments on such notorious offenders will have a very salutary effect, 
especially at this time. With regard to the subject of the trade carried on with the town, which you wrote to me about some days ago, I 
have not been able to collect a Council to advise with them on that 
subject, as they have almost all of them been so much indisposed, that 
they have not been able to attend to business; however, it would not 
be amiss still to hold up the threat of subjecting offenders to trial under 
the Sedition Act, and in the meantime to seize and condemn whatever 
is taken from them, in the utmost latitude of my proclamation. The 
enemy have lately sent some of their emissaries in the country, to persuade the people to carry all the provisions into them that they can collect, in consequence of which they are thronging to town in such 
droves, that the guard at Bacon's Bridge, detachments from the army, 
and even individuals, have made a great number of seizures, which 
have been condemned. This timely exertion has so far deterred them, 
that for several days past they seem to have given up their lucrative 
game, as no seizures have been made, so that their execrable policy has 
failed for once. The enemy has abandoned James Island. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
