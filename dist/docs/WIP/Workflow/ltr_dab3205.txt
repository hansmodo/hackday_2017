DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last, ten persons have been killed and 
wounded, taken by the Indians in Westmoreland county. Parties of regulars and militia have endeavoured 
to overtake them, but without success. 
</p><p>
The accounts I have received, relative to the British garrison at Detroit, differ widely, some making it 
to consist of only two hundred men, some three hundred, and others, upwards of four hundred. This has 
determined me to send Captain Brady, with five white 
men and two Delaware Indians, to Sandusky, to endeavour to take a British prisoner, which I hope he 
will effect. I have likewise offered other Delaware 
warriors fifty hard dollars worth of goods, for one British soldier, and they have promised to bring him immediately. Should an intelligent one be brought 
in, I intend to offer him some indulgence upon his 
giving me the most perfect intelligence in his power. 
</p><p>
I had lately called out eight hundred and twenty five rank and file, and a proportionate number of officers, from the militia, to aid me upon an enterprise 
against the Shawanese towns ; but, upon finding the 
true state of what provisions could be drawn from 
the Commissaries, and that they were prohibited from 
making any further purchases, I was compelled to 
postpone the attempt until a sufficient quantity of 
provisions can be procured. The militia appear to be 
very anxious to aid me, and I sincerely wish it was 
in my power to indulge them. I expect a small sup 
ply from below the mountains, which, if it proves to 
be of good quality, will enable me to subsist the dependent posts until the 1st of September. 
</p><p>
The soldiers frequently desert^ and are often apprehended ; and I expect sundry charges will soon be 
exhibited against some of the civil Staff Officers in 
this district. I shall, therefore, be much obliged fora few more blank orders, to enable me to assemble 
General Courts-Martial for their respective trials. 
</p><p>
I cannot learn that the ordnance and stores, ordered from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, have yet left <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a>, nor do I 
know of what kind they are, nor what their number 
or quality. I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient Servant, 
</p><p>
