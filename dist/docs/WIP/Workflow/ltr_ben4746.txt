QUERIES, recommended to the Consideration of those 
Gentlemen who are for vigorous measures with the Americans. 
</p><p>
1. Have the Colonists refused to answer any reasonable 
requisitions made to their Assemblies by the mother country? 
</p><p>
2. If they have not refused to grant reasonable aids in the 
way, which they think consistent with liberty, why must they 
be stripped of their property without their own consent, and 
in a way, which they think inconsistent with liberty? 
</p><p>
3. What is it for a people to be enslaved and tributary, if 
this be not, viz. to be forced to give up their property at the 
arbitrary pleasure of persons, to whose authority they have 
not submitted themselves, nor chosen for the purpose of imposing taxes upon them? Wherein consisted the impropriety of King Charles's demanding ship money by his sole 
authority, but in its being an exercise of power by the King, 
which the people had not given the King? Have the people 
of America, as the people of Britain, by sending representatives, consented to a power in the British parliament to tax them? 
</p><p>
4. Has not the British parliament, by repealing the stamp 
act, acknowledged that they judged it improper? Is there 
any difference between the stamp act, and the act obliging 
the Americans to pay whatever we please, for articles which 
they cannot do without, as glass and paper? Is there any 
difference as to justice between our treatment of the colonists, 
and the tyranny of the Carthaginians over their conquered 
Sardinians, when they obliged them to take all their corn 
from them, and at whatever price they pleased to set upon it? 
</p><p>
5. If that be true, what is commonly said, viz. That the 
mother country gains two millions a year by the colonies, 
would it not have been wiser to have gone on quietly in the 
happy way we were in, till our gains by those rising and 
flourishing countries should amount to three, four or five 
millions a year, than by these new fashioned vigorous measures to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs? Would 
it not have been better policy, instead of taxing our colonists, 
to have done whatever we could to enrich them; and encourage them to take off our articles of luxury, on which we 
may put our own price, and thus draw them into paying 
us a voluntary tax; than deluge them in blood, thin their 
countries, impoverish and distress them, interrupt their 
commerce, force them on bankruptcy, by which our merchants must be ruined, or tempt them to emigrations, or 
alliances with our enemies? 
</p><p>
6. The late war could not have been carried on without 
America, nor without Scotland? Have we treated America 
and Scotland in such a manner as is likely in future wars to 
encourage their zeal for the common cause ? Or is England 
alone to be the Drawcansir of the world, and to bully not 
only their enemies, but her friends ? 
</p><p>
7. Are not the subjects of Britain concerned to check a 
ministry, who, by this rage of heaping taxes on taxes, are only 
drawing into their own hands more and more wealth and 
power, while they are hurting the commercial interest of the 
empire in general, at the same time that, amidst profound 
peace, the national debt and burden on the public continue undiminished ?
