Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 5th of June came to band on the 25th 
instant. Mr Delap will inform you of the state of remittances in his hands. Messrs Cliffords St Teysett, and Mr Hodgson of Amsterdam, have received next to nothing ; 
about two hundred pounds by the last accounts ; from which 
you will perceive that not one third of the sura proposed 
has come to hand, and even out of that my private expenses and those for promoting the other parts of my mission 
must take something, let me be ever so prudent and cautious. 
</p><p>
To solicit arms, clothing, and tents for thirty thousand 
men, two hundred brass cannon, mortars, and other stores 
in proportion, and to be destitute of one shilling of ready-money, exclusive of the fund of forty thousand pounds originally designed for other affairs, (which you know by the 
protests in London was my case) has left me in a critical 
situation. To let slip such an opportunity for want of ready 
money would be unpardonable, and yet that was taking out 
of a fund before deficient. I hope, however, to execute 
both, though not in the season I could have wished. I have, 
as you see, had but a few days since the receiving of yours, 
in which I have discoursed with some of the persons to 
whom [ had before proposed such a scheme, and think it 
will take well, but as men of property will be engaged in 
it, the remittances should be made very punctual. 
</p><p>
The insurance I am sensible had better be in Europe, 
but it cannot be had at present unless in Holland, where I 
am told there are often disputes with the underwriters. On 
the whole it must be done in America. I can, I believe, 
engage for one hundred thousand pounds sterling during 
the winter. I shall write to you further in a few days. 
</p><p>
You have mentioned to me a loan. I choose to speak of 
this in a letter of business particularly by itself, which I 
will endeavor to do by a young gentleman going on Sunday, to which opportunity I also refer what I have further 
to say on this subject. Pray forward the trifles I am sending to my little deserted family as soon as received. 
</p><p>
Tobacco is rising very fast, being now seven stivers in Holland. The scheme of the Farmers-General here is 
very artful ; they grow anxious. They held high terms on my first application. I turned off, and they are now applying to me, as are also some people further northward. 
</p><p>
God bless and prosper America is the prayer of every one here, to which I say Amen and Amen. 
</p><p>
I am, Sec. 
</p><p>
SILAS DEANE
