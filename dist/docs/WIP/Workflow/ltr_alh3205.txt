Robins's Tavern, 8 miles from <a href='/results.php?city=allentown' rel='city origin'>Allentown</a> ; 12 o clock; <a rel="day origin" value="26">26</a> <a rel="month origin" value="6">June</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1778' rel="origin">1778</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
We have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last reports, were four miles from this 
(that is, their rear), and had passed the road which 
turns off towards South Amboy, which determines 
their route towards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is the extreme distress of the troops for want 
of provisions. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>'s detachment is almost 
starving, and seem both unwilling and unable to march 
further, till they are supplied. If we do not receive 
an immediate supply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated. 
</p><p>
This morning we missed doing any thing from a 
deficiency of intelligence. On my arrival at Crauberry yester-evening, I proceeded, by desire of the 
Marquis, immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=hightstown' rel='city'>Hightstown</a> and Allentown, 
to take measures for cooperating with the different 
parts of the detachment, and to find what was doing 
to procure intelligence. I found every precaution was 
neglected no horse was near the enemy, or could be 
heard of till late in the morning; so that, before we 
could send out parties and get the necessary information, they were in full march; and, as they have 
marched pretty expeditionary, we should not be able 
to come up with them during the march of the day, 
if we did not suffer the impediment we do on the 
score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss where 
the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to our enterprise. If the army is wholly out of supporting 
distance, we risk the total loss of the detachment in 
making an attack. 
</p><p>
If the army will countenance us, we may do some 
thing clever. We feel our personal honor, as well as 
the honor of the army and the good of the service 
interested, and are heartily desirous to attempt what 
ever the disposition of our men will second, and prudence authorize. It is evident the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. 
</p><p>
Desertions, I imagine, have been pretty consider 
able to-day. I have seen eight or ten deserters, and 
have heard of many more. We have had some little 
skirmishing by detached parties. One attacked their 
rear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and 
took seven prisoners. I am, with great respect and 
regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant.

P. S. The Marquis and General Dickinson send 
their compliments. My writing renders theirs unnecessary. 
</p><p>
An officer just comes in, who informs me that he 
left the enemy's rear five miles off, still in march, 
about half an hour ago. To ascertain still more fully 
their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their 
left, towards the head of their column. They have 
three brigades in rear of their baggage.
