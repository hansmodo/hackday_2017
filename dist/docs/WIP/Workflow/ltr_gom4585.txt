Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the eleventh instant. I have no 
doubt but that the advocates of the Assignats forces will triumph in the success of their favorite plan. A momentary advantage was of course to be expected, and in all matters de 
pending on opinion the effect becomes a cause ; hence you 
will find for some time a regular increase of the happy consequences. But this measure has in it the certain cause of evil, 
and that cause will in due time produce its effect, which will 
also be increased by opinion. The bounds of a letter would 
not permit of the full developement of such principles as apply 
to the subject; but a word to the wise is sufficient. 
</p><p>
I would send you Hamilton's plan, (just now received,) but 
Mr Parker has already sent it, and you will find one postage 
sufficient. It was not from what I found in Amsterdam, that I 
was deterred from pursuing the propositions to M. Necker, but 
the conviction that his expectations have been so raised, as to 
shut his ears to anything which could with safety be proposed ; 
and I have not enough of the knight errant in my composition 
to go beyond that line. 
</p><p>
I think <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>'s idea of obtaining money at four 
per cent is premature. Doubtless it will be practicable at a 
future day, when we do not want money, and our loans should 
be so managed now, as to leave room for taking advantage of 
that circumstance hereafter; but such an attempt would not 
succeed at present. Had my proposals been accepted. I think 
I should have so managed as to bring that matter about in a 
very short time ; but everything must be now suspended, for 
a few weeks at least. I am, &c.
