Dear John, 
</p><p>
Your letters of 26th Jan., 25th Feb., and 4th inst., are all before me. They are written with so much friendship 
and affection as to afford me great consolation, and convince me, notwithstanding my heavy losses, that in you I 
have more left than falls to the lot of most of my fellow mortals. May the blessing be continued to me, and I know how to value it. 
</p><p>
I sympathize most sincerely with you in your melancholy apprehensions about your parents. X know and I can feel 
such a loss ; but you draw your consolation from a never failing source, which will enable you to bear this misfortune whenever it shall happen, with that resignation to the will 
of Heaven which becomes one who is satisfied both of its wisdom and goodness. If we could shake off human frailty 
in the hour of affliction, we should certainly think it less reasonable to lament the death of a good man than to complain of the absence of a friend, who by that absence infinitely increases his happiness ; to wish them back is selfish 
and unworthy of true friendship, and yet we may, we must grieve when we arc not permitted to take leave. It is, I 
am sensible, a weakness, but I cannot help suffering myself to be afflicted at this circumstance. I know the pleasure that the best of fathers always took in my company 
and conversation ; and when I indulge the thought, I am unhappy that by my absence I lessened any of his enjoyments. 
But where am I running — God bless you — farewell.

Your friend,
