DEAR M' HALL. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd yours of June 20. &. 22. I have wrote my Mind 
fully to you in former Letters relating to the Stamp Act; 
so that I have but little to add, except what you desire to know 
about the 2/ on Advertisements. It is undoubtedly to be 
paid every Time the Advertisement is inserted. As to the 
Paper sent over, I did it for the best, having at that time 
Expectations given me that we might have had it stampt 
there; in which case you would have had great Advantage 
of the other Printers, since if they were not provided with 
such Paper, they must have either printed but a half sheet 
common Demi, or paid for two Stamps on each Sheet. The 
Plan was afterward altered notwithstanding all I could do, 
it being alledged that Scotland & every Colony would expect 
the same Indulgence if it was granted to us. The Papers 
must not be sent back again : But I hope you will excuse 
what I did in Good will, tho' it happened wrong The 
Molds I still think you should have, as you see that Paper 
from hence is much dearer than we can make it, with all 
Charge of Carriage, but that I hope to get off. 
</p><p>
I would not have you by any means drop the Newspaper, 
as I am sure it will soon recover any present Loss, and may 
be carried on to advantage, if you steadily proceed as I propos'd in former Letters. I am 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN
