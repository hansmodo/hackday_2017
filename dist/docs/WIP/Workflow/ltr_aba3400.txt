MY DEAR SISTER 
</p><p>
I have been sixteen days at sea, and have not 
attempted to write a single letter. 'T is true, I have 
kept a journal whenever I was able ; but that must 
be close locked up, unless I was sure to hand it you 
with safety. 
</p><p>
'T is said of Cato, the Roman Censor, that one of 
the three things, which he regretted during his life, 
was going once by sea when he might have made 
his journey by land. I fancy the philosopher was 
not proof against that most disheartening, dispiriting 
malady, sea-sickness. Of this I am very sure, that 
no lady would ever wish a second time to try the 
sea, were the objects of her pursuit within the reach 
of a land journey. I have had frequent occasion, 
since I came on board, to recollect an observation of 
my best friend's, " that no being in nature was so 
disagreeable as a lady at sea," and this recollection 
has in a great measure reconciled me to the thought 
of being at sea without him ; for one would not wish, 
my dear sister, to be thought of in that light by 
those, to whom we would wish to appear in our best 
array. The decency and decorum of the most 
delicate female must in some measure yield to the 
necessities of nature ; and, if you have no female 
capable of rendering you the least assistance, you 
will feel grateful to any one who will feel for you, 
and relieve or compassionate your sufferings. 
</p><p>
And this was truly the case of your poor sister 
and all her female companions, when not one of us 
could make her own bed, put on or take off her 
shoes, or even lift a finger. As to our other clothing, we wore the greater part of it until we were 
able to help ourselves. Added to this misfortune, 
Briesler, my man-servant, was as bad as any of us. 
But for Job, I know not what we should have done. 
Kind, attentive, quick, neat, he was our nurse for 
two days and nights ; and, from handling the sails 
at the top-gallant-mast head, to the more feminine 
employment of making wine-cordial, he has not his 
equal on board. In short, he is the favorite of the 
whole ship. Our sickness continued for ten days, 
with some intermissions. We crawled upon deck 
whenever we were able ; but it was so cold and 
damp, that we could not remain long upon it. And 
the confinement of the air below, the constant rolling 
of the vessel, and the nausea of the ship, which was 
much too tight, contributed to keep up our disease. 
The vessel is very deep loaded with oil and potash. 
The oil leaks, the potash smokes and ferments. 
All adds to the flavor. When you add to all this 
the horrid dirtiness of the ship, the slovenliness of 
the steward, and the unavoidable slopping and spilling occasioned by the tossing of the ship, I am sure 
you will be thankful that the pen is not in the hand of 
Swift or Smollet, and still more so that you are far 
removed from the scene. No sooner was I able to 
move, than I found it necessary to make a bustle 
amongst the waiters, and demand a cleaner abode. 
By this time, Briesler was upon his feet, and, as I 
found I might reign mistress on board without any 
offence, I soon exerted my authority with scrapers, 
mops, brushes, infusions of vinegar, &c., and in a 
few hours you would have thought yourself in a 
different ship. Since which, our abode is much 
more tolerable, and the gentlemen all thank me for 
my care. Our captain is an admirable seaman, 
always attentive to his sails and his rigging ; keeps 
the deck all night ; careful of everybody on board ; 
watchful that they run no risk ; kind and humane to 
his men, who are all as still and quiet as any private 
family ; nothing cross or dictatorial in his manners ; 
a much more agreeable man than I expected to find 
him. He cannot be called a polished gentleman ; 
but he is, so far as I have seen, a very clever man. 
</p><p>
We have for passengers, a Colonel Norton, who is 
a grave, sedate man, of a good natural understanding, 
improved by business and converse with mankind ; 
his literary accomplishments not very great. A Mr. 
Green, a Scotchman I am persuaded ; a high prerogative man ; plumes himself upon his country ; haughty and imperious, but endeavours to hide this with 
the appearance of politeness, which, however, he is 
too apt to transgress upon any occasion when a 
subject arises which does not entirely agree with 
his sentiments ; he calls himself an Englishman ; has 
been in the British service during the war, as a 
secretary on board some of the British admirals. 
He is a man of sense and of reading, the most so of 
any we have on board. Next to him is Dr. Clark, 
to whom we are under obligations for every kindness and every attention, that it is in the power of a 
gentleman and a physician to show. Humane, benevolent, tender, and attentive not only to the ladies, 
but to every one on board, to the servant as well as 
the master, he has rendered our voyage much more 
agreeable and pleasant than it possibly could have 
been without him. His advice we have stood in 
need of, and his care we have felt the benefit of. 
A brother could not have been kinder, nor a parent 
tenderer, and it was all in the pleasant, easy, cheerful way, without any thing studied, labored, or fulsome ; the natural result of a good heart, possessed 
with the power of making others happy. 
</p><p>
'T is not a little attention that we ladies stand in 
need of at sea ; for it is not once in the twenty-four 
hours that we can even cross the cabin without being 
held or assisted. Nor can we go upon deck without 
the assistance of two gentlemen, and when there, we 
are always bound into our chairs. Whilst you, 
I imagine, are scorching under the midsummer heat, 
we can comfortably bear our double calico gowns, 
our baize ones upon them, and a cloth cloak in addition to all these. 
</p><p>
Mr. Foster is another passenger on board, a merchant, a gentleman soft in his manners, very polite 
and kind ; loves domestic life, and thinks justly of it. 
I respect him on this account. Mr. Spear brings up 
the rear, a single gentleman, with a great deal of 
good humor, some wit, and much drollery ; easy 
and happy, blow high or blow low ; can sleep and 
laugh at all seasons. These are our male companions. I hardly thought a Lieutenant Mellicot 
worth mentioning, who is, I believe, a mere potcompanion, though he keeps not with us except at 
meal-times, when he does not behave amiss. My 
namesake l you know. She is a modest, pretty 
woman, and behaves very well. 
</p><p>
I have accustomed myself to writing a little everyday, when I was able, so that a small motion of the 
ship does not render it more unintelligible than 
usual ; but there is no time, since I have been at 
sea, when the ship is what we call still, that its 
motion is not equal to the moderate rocking of a 
cradle. As to wind and weather, since we came out, 
they have been very fortunate for us in general. 
We have had three calm days, and two days contrary wind, with a storm, I called it ; but the sailors 
say it was only a breeze. This was upon the Banks 
of Newfoundland, the wind at east ; through the day 
we could not sit in our chairs, only as some gentleman sat by us with his arm fastened into ours, and 
his feet braced against a table or chair, that was 
lashed down with ropes ; bottles, mugs, plates, 
crashing to pieces, first on one side and then on the 
other ; the sea running mountain-high, and knocking 
against the sides of the vessel as though it would 
burst them. When I became so fatigued with 
the incessant motion as not to be able to sit any 
longer, I was assisted into my cabin, where I was 
obliged to hold myself in with all my might the remainder of the night. No person, who is a stranger 
to the sea, can form an adequate idea of the debility 
occasioned by sea-sickness. The hard rocking of a 
ship in a storm, and the want of sleep for many 
nights, altogether reduce one to such a lassitude 
that you care little for your fate. The old seamen 
thought nothing of all this, nor once entertained an 
idea of danger. Compared to what they have suffered, I do suppose it was trifling ; but to me it was 
alarming, and I most heartily prayed, if this was 
only a breeze, to be delivered from a storm. 
</p><p>
Our accommodations on board are not what I 
could wish, or hoped for. We cannot be alone, 
only when the gentlemen are thoughtful enough to 
retire upon deck, which they do for about an hour 
in the course of the day. Our state-rooms are about 
half as large as cousin Betsey's little chamber, with 
two cabins in each. Mine had three, but I could not 
live so. Upon which <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a>'s brother gave up 
his to Abby, 1 and we are now stowed two and two. 
This place has a small grated window, which opens 
into the companion-way, and by this is the only air 
admitted. The door opens into the cabin, where the 
gentlemen all sleep, and where we sit, dine, &c. 
We can only live with our door shut, whilst we dress 
and undress. Necessity has no law ; but what should 
I have thought on shore, to have laid myself clown to 
sleep in common with half a dozen gentlemen ? 
We have curtains, it is true, and we only in part 
undress, about as much as the Yankee bundlers ; but 
we have the satisfaction of falling; in with a set of 
well-behaved, decent gentlemen, whose whole deportment is agreeable to the strictest delicacy, both 
in word and action. 
</p><p>
If the wind and weather continue as favorable as 
they have hitherto been, w r e expect to make our 
passage in thirty days, which is going a hundred 
miles a day. 'T is a vast tract of ocean which we 
have to traverse ; I have contemplated it with its 
various appearances. It is indeed a secret world of 
wonders, and one of the sublimest objects in Nature. 
</p><p>
" Thou mak'st the foaming billows roar, 
Thou mak'st the roaring billows sleep."' 
</p><p>
They proclaim the Deity, and are objects too vast 
for the control of feeble man. That Being alone, 
who " maketh the clouds his chariot, and rideth upon 
the wings of the wind," is equal to the government 
of this stupendous part of creation. 
</p><p>
And now, my dear sister, after this minute account 
of my important self, which, judging by myself, you 
take an affectionate interest in, I call upon you to 
inquire after your welfare, my much esteemed 
brother's, and my dear niece's. Not a day or night 
but I visit your calm retreat, look at my own deserted habitation, and recollect past endearments 
with a melancholy composure, and really am so 
vain as to commiserate you on account of the vacuity 
I fancy my absence occasions. 
</p><p>
We are so formed," says an ingenious writer, 
as to be always pleased with somewhat in prospect, 
however distant, or however trivial." Thus do I 
gratify myself with the idea of returning to my native land, though the prospect is distant. " Pleasures," says Pope, "are ever in our hands or 
eyes." I have lost part of the other line, but 
the idea is, that, if we are not in the present possession of them, they rise to us in prospect. 1 ^ I 
will now tell you where T am sitting. At a square 
table in the great cabin, at one corner of which are 
Colonel Norton and Mr. Foster, engaged in playing backgammon ; at the other, Mr. Green, writing ; 
and at the fourth, Dr. Clark, eating ham. Behind 
Colonel Norton, Mr. Spear, reading Thomson's 
" Seasons " with his hat on. Young Lawrence be
1 " Pleasures are ever in our hands and eyes ; 
And when in act they cease, in prospect rise." 
hind me, reading Anson's " Voyages ; " Esther, 1 
knitting ; the steward and boys, bustling about after 
wine and porter ; and last of all, as the least importantly employed, <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a> and Abby, in their 
cabin asleep, and this at twelve o'clock in the day. 
O shame ! The Captain comes down and finds me 
writing ; kindly tenders me some large paper to 
write upon ; I believe he thinks I shall have occasion 
for it. This man has a kindness in his disposition, 
which his countenance does not promise. Mr. Green 
comes down from deck, and reports that the mate 
says we are sixteen hundred miles on our way. This 
is good nearing ; I can scarcely realize myself upon 
the ocean, or that I am within fourteen hundred 
miles of the British coast. I rejoice with trembling ; 
painful and fearful ideas will arise and intermix with 
the pleasurable hopes of a joyful meeting of my long 
absent friend. I frequently recollect some lines of 
Miss More's, in her " Sir Eldred of the Bower," 
describing a mixture of hope and anxiety. She 
says ; 
</p><p>
" 'T was such a sober sense of joy, 
As angels well might keep ; 
A joy chastised by piety, 
A joy prepared to weep." 
</p><p>
I shall write, whilst I am on board, whenever I can 
catch a quiet time. It is an amusement to me ; readinn tires one ; work I do sometimes, but, when there 
is no writing, there is less pleasure in working ; I 
shall keep the letter open until I arrive, and put it on 
board the first vessel I find coming to America. 
'T is impossible for me to find any variety at sea 
to entertain my friends with, so that this letter with 
all its inaccuracies must be submitted to them. Do 
not however expose me, especially where I have a 
little credit ; you know very well that affection and 
intimacy will cover a multitude of faults. 
</p><p>
7 July. 
</p><p>
If I did not write every day, I should lose the 
days of the month and of the week ; confined all day 
on account of the weather, which is foggy, misty, and 
wet. You can hardly judge how irksome this confinement is. When the whole ship is at our service, 
it is little better than a prison. We suppose ourselves near the Western Islands. O dear variety ! 
how pleasing to the human mind is change. I cannot find such a fund of entertainment within myself 
as not to require outward objects for my amusement. 
Nature abounds with variety, and the mind, unless 
fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new 
objects , and the variety of scenes which present 
themselves to the senses were certainly designed to 
prevent our attention from being too long fixed upon 
any one object. " This," says a late celebrated 
medical writer, " greatly conduces to the health of 
the animal frame ; your studious people and your 
deep thinkers," he observes, " seldom enjoy either 
health or spirits." 
I have been in much trouble, upon looking over my 
letters since I came on board, to find those given me 
by my friend, Mrs. Warren, missing. I cannot account for it in any other way, than that I must have 
put them into the pocket of the chaise, when I received them, which I recollect ; and I did not think 
to take them out. You remember the day with all 
the circumstances, and will accordingly apologize to 
our friend, whose goodness, I know, will pardon the 
omission, nor add to my mortification by charging it 
to inattention. 
</p><p>
8 July. 
</p><p>
Another wet, drizzly day, but we must not complain, for we have a fair wind, our sails all square, 
and go at seven knots an hour. I have made a great 
acquisition. I have learnt the names and places of 
all the masts and sails ; and the Captain compliments 
me by telling me that he is sure I know well enough 
how to steer, to take a turn at the helm. I may do 
pretty well in fair weather, but 't is your masculine 
spirits that are made for storms. I love the tranquil 
scenes of life. Nor can I look forward to those in 
which 'tis probable I shall soon be engaged with 
those pleasurable ideas, which a retrospect of the past 
presents to my mind. 
</p><p>
I went last evening upon deck, at the invitation of 
Mr. Foster, to view that phenomenon of Nature, a 
blazing ocean. A light flame spreads over the ocean, 
in appearance, with thousands of thousands of sparkling gems, resembling our fire-flies in a dark night. 
It has a most beautiful appearance. I never view the 
ocean without being filled with ideas of the sublime, 
and am ready to break forth with the Psalmist, 
" Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God 
Almighty ; in wisdom hast thou made them all." 
</p><p>
Saturday, 10th. 
</p><p>
Yesterday was a very pleasant day. Very little 
wind, but a fine sun and a smooth sea. I spent most 
of the day upon deck, reading ; it was not, however, 
so warm but a baize gown was very comfortable. 
The ship has gradually become less irksome to me. 
If our cook was but tolerably clean, I could relish 
my food. But he is a great, dirty, lazy negro, with 
no more knowledge of cookery than a savage, nor 
any kind of order in the distribution of his dishes ; 
but on they come, higgledy-piggledy, with a leg of 
pork all bristly ; a quarter of an hour after, a pudding ; or, perhaps, a pair of roast fowls, first of all, 
and then will follow one by one a piece of beef, 
and, when dinner is nearly completed, a plate of 
potatoes. Such a fellow is a real imposition upon 
the passengers. But gentlemen know but little 
about the matter, and, if they can get enough to eat 
five times a day, all goes well. We ladies have not 
eaten, upon our whole passage, more than just 
enough to satisfy nature, or to keep body and soul 
together. 
Thursday, loth of July. 
On Sunday, I wrote part of a letter to sister Shaw, 
since which I have not used my pen, even in my 
journal. Monday we had a fair wind, but too much 
to be able to write, as it was right aft, and we pitched exceedingly, which is a motion more disagreeable 
to me than the rocking, though less fatiguing. On 
Tuesday a calm. Should you not suppose that in a 
calm we at least had the satisfaction of lying still ? 
Alas ! it is far otherwise, as my flesh and bones 
witness ; a calm generally succeeds a storm or a 
fresh breeze ; the sea has a great swell after the 
wind is silent, so that the ship lies entirely at the 
mercy of the waves, and is knocked from side to side 
with a force you can form no idea of without experience. I have been more wearied and worn out 
with the motion and exercise of a calm than in riding fifty miles in a day. We have had three days 
in succession nearly calm ; the first is the most 
troublesome, as the motion of the sea subsides in a 
degree. It is, however, a great trial of one's patience, to think yourself within a few days of your 
desired port, to look at it as the promised land, and 
yet to be held fast ; 
</p><p>
" Ye too, ye winds, I raise my voice to you. 
In what far distant region of the sky, 
Hushed in deep silence, sleep you when 't is calm ? " 
</p><p>
I begin to think, that a calm is not desirable in any 
situation in life. Every object is most beautiful in 
motion ; a ship under sail, trees gently agitated with 
the wind, and a fine woman dancing, are three instances in point. Man was made for action and for 
bustle too, I believe. I am quite out of conceit with 
calms. I have more reason for it, too, than many 
others, for the dampness of the ship has for several 
days threatened me with the rheumatism ; and yesterday morning I was seized with it in good earnest. 
I could not raise my head, nor get out of bed without assistance. I had a good deal of fever, and was 
very sick. I was fearful of this before I came to 
sea, and had proper medicine put up, which the 
doctor administered. What with that, good nursing 
and rubbing, flannel, &c, I am able to-day to sit up 
in my bed and write, as you see. To-day we have 
a small wind, but 't is right ahead. This is still 
mortifying, but what we had reason to expect. Patience, patience, patience, is the first, second, and 
third virtue of a seaman, or, rather, as necessary to 
him as to a statesman. Three days' good wind 
would give us land. 
</p><p>
Friday. 
</p><p>
We have another wet, misty day ; the cabin so 
damp that I dare not sit in it ; I am therefore 
obliged, confined as it is, to keep in my own little 
room, and upon my bed. I long for the day which 
will give us land. Esther makes but a poor hand 
at sea. Scarcely a day, but what she is sick some 
part of it. I hope she will be the better for it when 
she gets on shore. We have but one passenger 
whom we should have been willing to have been 
without. I have no particular reason to dislike 
him, as he is studiously complaisant to me ; but 
I know his politeness to me is not personally 
upon my own account, but because of my connexion, which gives me importance sufficient to 
entitle me to his notice. Abby says he is exactly such a character as Mr. A . I really think 
there is a striking resemblance. He was always 
inquiring, " Who was such a general ? What was 
his origin and rank in life ? " I have felt a disposition to quarrel with him several times, but have 
restrained myself, and only observed to him, mildly, 
that merit, not title, gave a man preeminence in 
our country ; that I did not doubt it was a mortifying circumstance to the British nobility to find themselves so often conquered by mechanics and mere 
husbandmen ; but that we esteemed it our glory to 
draw such characters not only into the field, but into 
the Senate ; and I believed no one would deny that 
they had shone in both. All our passengds enjoyed 
this conversation, and the gentleman was civil enough 
to drop the subject ; but the venom spits out very 
often : yet the creature is sensible and entertaining 
when upon indifferent subjects. He is a haughty 
Scotchman ; he hates the French, and upon all occasions ridicules them and their country. I fancy, 
from his haughty airs, that his own rank in life has 
not been superior to those whom he affects to despise. He is not a man of liberal sentiments, and is 
less beloved than any passenger we have on board. 
</p><p>
A man's humor contributes much to the making him 
agreeable or otherwise. Dark and sour humors, 
especially those which have a spice of malevolence 
in them, are vastly disagreeable. Such men have 
no music in their souls. I believe he would hardly 
be so complaisant, if he knew how meanly I thought 
of him ; but he deserves it all ; his whole countenance shows his heart. 
</p><p>
Saturday, 17 July. 
</p><p>
Give me joy, my dear sister ; we have sounded today and found bottom, fifty-five fathom. We have 
seen, through the course of the day, twenty different 
sail, and spoke with a small boat upon a smuggling 
expedition, which assured us we were within the 
Channel. 
</p><p>
18 July. 
</p><p>
This day four weeks we came on board. Are 
you not all calculating to-day that we are near the 
land ? Happily, you are not wrong in your conjectures. I do not despair of seeing it yet before night, 
though our wind is very small and light. The 
captain has just been down to advise us, as the vessel is so quiet, to get what things we wish to carry 
on shore into our small trunks. He hopes to land 
us at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, seventy miles distant from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, to-morrow or next day ; from thence we are to 
proceed, in post-chaises, to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. The ship may 
be a week in the Channel before she will be able to 
get up. 
</p><p>
Deal, 20 July, 
</p><p>
Heaven be praised, I have safely landed upon the 
British coast. How flattering, how smooth the ocean, 
how delightful was Sunday, the 18th of July. We 
flattered ourselves with the prospect of a gentle 
breeze to carry us on shore at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, where 
we agreed to land, as going up the Channel always 
proves tedious ; but on Sunday night the wind shifted 
to the southwest, which, upon this coast, is the same 
with our northeast winds. It blew a gale on Sunday night, on Monday and Monday night, equal to 
an equinoctial. We were obliged to carry doublereefed topsails only, and what added to our misfortunes was, that, though we had made land the day 
before, it was so thick that we could not certainly 
determine what land it was. It is now Tuesday, 
and. I have slept only four hours since Saturdaynight, such was the tossing and tumbling on board 
our ship. The captain never left the deck the 
whole time, either to eat or sleep, though they told 
me there was no danger ; nor do I suppose that 
there really was any, as we had sea-room enough. 
Yet, the great number of vessels constantly coming out of the Channel, and the apprehension of 
being run down, or being nearer the land than 
we imagined, kept me constantly agitated. Added 
to this, I had a violent sick headache. ! what 
would I have given to have been quiet upon the 
land. You will hardly wonder, then, at the joy we 
felt this day in seeing the cliffs of Dover, Dover 
castle, and town. The wind was in some measure 
subsided. It rained, however, and was as squally 
as the month of March ; the sea ran very high ; a 
pilot-boat came on board at about ten o'clock this 
morning. The captain came to anchor with his 
ship in the Downs, and the little town of Deal lay 
before us. Some of the gentlemen talked of going 
on shore with the pilot-boat, and sending for us if 
the wind subsided. The boat was about as large as 
a Charlestown ferry-boat, and the distance from the 
ship about twice as far as from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to Charlestown ; a shore as bold as Nantasket beach ; no 
wharf, but you must be run right on shore by a 
wave, where a number of men stand to catch hold 
of the boat, and draw it up. The surf ran six feet 
high, but this we did not know until driven on by a 
wave ; for the pilots, eager to get money, assured 
the gentlemen they could land us safe, without our 
being wet ; and, as we saw no prospect of its being 
better through the day, we accordingly agreed to go. 
We were wrapped up and lowered from the ship 
into the boat ; the whole ship's crew eager to assist 
us ; the gentlemen attentive and kind as though we 
were all brothers and sisters. We have spent a 
month together, and were as happy as the sea would 
permit us to be. We set off from the vessel, now 
mounting upon the top of a wave high as a steeple, 
and then so low that the boat was not to be seen, 
I could keep myself up no other way than as one of 
the gentlemen stood braced up against the boat, fast 
hold of me, and I with both my arms round him ; 
the other ladies were held in the same manner, 
whilst every wave gave us a broadside, and finally a 
wave landed us with the utmost force upon the 
beach, the broadside of the boat right against the 
shore, which was owing to the bad management of 
the men, and the high sea. 
</p><p>
(Thus far I had proceeded in my account, when a 
summons to tea prevented my adding more ; since 
which I have not been able to take my pen. Though 
now, at my lodgings in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, I will take up the 
thread where I left it, until the whole ball is unwound. Every particular will be interesting to my 
friends, I presume, and to no others expose this incorrect scrawl.) 
</p><p>
We consequently all pressed upon the side next 
the shore, to get out as quick as possible, which we 
need not have done, if we had known what I afterwards found to be the case, that it was the only way 
in which we could be landed, and not, as I at first 
supposed, owing to the bad management of the 
boatmen. We should have sat still for a succession 
of waves to have carried us up higher, but the roar 
of them terrified us all, and we expected the next 
would fill our boat ; so out we sprang, as fast as 
possible, sinking every step into the sand, and looking like a parcel of Naiads, just rising from the sea. 
A public house was fortunately just at hand, into 
which we thankfully entered, changed our clothing, 
dried ourselves, and, not being able to procure carriages that day, we engaged them for six o'clock the 
next morning, and took lodgings there, all of us, ten 
in number. Mr. Green set off immediately for <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> ; nobody mourned. We were all glad to retire 
early to rest. For myself, I was so faint and fatigued, that I could get but little. We rose at five, 
and, our post-chaises being all at the door, we set 
off, in the following order ; Mr. Foster, myself, and 
Esther, in one, Dr. Clark and Abby in the second, 
Colonel Norton, <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='me'>Mrs. Adams</a> and brother, in the 
third, and Mr. Spear and Lieutenant Mellicot brought 
up the rear. Our first stage was eighteen miles, from 
Deal to Canterbury, where we breakfasted ; the 
roads are fine, and a stone a novelty ; I do not recollect to have seen one, except the pavements of 
Canterbury and other towns, from Deal to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, 
which is seventy-two miles. Vast fields of wheat, 
oats, English beans, and the horse-bean, with hops, 
are the produce of the country through which we 
passed, which is cultivated like a garden down to 
the very edge of the road, and what surprised me 
was that very little was enclosed within fences. 
Hedge fences are almost the only kind you see ; no 
cattle at large without a herdsman ; the oxen are 
small, but the cows and sheep very large, such as I 
never saw before. When we arrive at the end of 
our stage, we discharge the first carriages, and call 
for new ones, which will be ready in a few moments 
after you issue your orders. Call for breakfast,- you 
have it, perhaps, in ten minutes for ten people, with 
the best of attendance, and at a reasonable price. 
Canterbury is a larger town than <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. It contains a number of old Gothic cathedrals, which are 
all of stone, very heavy, with but few windows, 
which are grated with large bars of iron, and look 
more like jails for criminals, than places designed 
for the worship of the Deity. One would suppose, 
from the manner in which they are guarded, that 
they apprehended devotion would be stolen. They 
have a most gloomy appearance, and really made 
me shudder. The houses, too, have a heavy look, 
being chiefly thatched roofs, or covered with crooked 
brick tiles. Now and then you would see upon the 
road a large wood, looking like a forest, for a whole 
mile, enclosed with a high brick wall, or cemented 
stone ; an enormous iron gate would give one a peep, 
as we passed, of a large pile of building, which 
looked like the castles of some of the ancient 
barons ; but, as we were strangers in the country, 
we could only conjecture what they were, and what 
they might have been. We proceeded from Canterbury to Rochester, about fifteen miles, another 
pretty town, not so large as the former. From 
thence to Chatham, where we stopped at a very 
elegant inn to dine. As soon as you drive into the 
yard, you have at these places as many footmen 
round you as you have carriages, who, with their 
politest airs, take down the step of your carriage, 
assist you out, inquire if you want fresh horses or 
carriages ; " Will supply you directly, Sir," is the answer ; a well-dressed hostess steps forward, making 
a lady-like appearance, and wishes your commands ; 
if you desire a chamber, the chambermaid attends ; 
you request dinner, say in half an hour ; the bill of 
fare is. directly brought; you mark what you wish to 
have, and suppose it to be a variety of fish, fowl, and 
meat, all of which we had, up to eight different 
dishes, besides vegetables. The moment the time 
you stated is out, you will have your dinner upon 
table in as elegant a style as at any gentleman's 
table, with your powdered waiters, and the master 
or mistress always brings the first dish upon table 
in person. But you must know that travelling in a 
post-chaise is what entitles you to all this respect. 
</p><p>
From Chatham we proceeded on our way as fast 
as possible, wishing to pass Blackheath before dark. 
Upon this road, a gentleman alone in a chaise passed 
us, and very soon a coach before us stopped, and 
there was a hue and cry, " A robbery, a robbery ! M 
The man in the chaise was the person robbed, and 
mis in open day with carriages constantly passing. 
We were not a little alarmed, and every one was 
concealing his money. Every place we passed and 
every post-chaise we met was crying out, " A robbery ! " Where the thing is so common, I was surprised to see such an alarm. The robber was pursued 
and taken in about two miles, and we saw the poor 
wretch, ghastly and horrible, brought along on foot ; 
his horse ridden by a person who took him, who also 
had his pistol. He looked like a youth of twenty 
only, attempted to lift his hat, and looked despair. 
You can form some idea of my feelings when they 
told him, " Ay, you have but a short time ; the assize 
sits next month ; and then, my lad, you swing." 
Though every robber may deserve death, yet to exult over the wretched is what our country is not 
accustomed to. Long may it be free from such 
villanies, and long may it preserve a commiseration 
for the wretched. 
</p><p>
We proceeded, until at about eight o'clock I 
was set s down at Low's Hotel in Covent Garden, 
the Court end of the town. These lodgings I took 
only for one night, until others more private could be 
procured. As I found <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> was not here, 
I did not wish such expensive apartments. It was 
the hotel at which he kept, when he resided here. 
Mr. Spear set out in quest of Mr. Smith ; but he 
had received intelligence of my coming out with 
Captain Lyde, and had been in quest of me but 
half an hour before at this very place. Mr. Spear 
was obliged to go first to the custom-house, and, 
as good fortune would have it, Mr. Smith and Mr. 
Storer were near it and saw him alight from the 
coach, upon which he informed them of my arrival. Though a mile distant, they set out upon a 
fall run, (they say,) and very soon, to our mutual 
satisfaction, we met in the hotel. " How do you ? ' 
and " How do ye ? " " We rejoice to see you here ;" 
and a thousand such kind of inquiries as take place 
between friends, who have not seen each other for a 
long time, naturally occurred. My first inquiry was 
for <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>. I found that my son had been a 
month waiting for my arrival in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, expecting 
me with Callaghan, but that, upon getting letters by 
him, he returned to the Hague. Mr. Smith had received a letter from his father, acquainting him that 
I had taken passage with Captain Lyde. This intelligence he forwarded three days before I came, so that 
I hourly expect either <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> or Master John. I 
should have mentioned, that Mr. Smith had engaged 
lodgings for me, to which Mr. Storer and he accompanied me this morning, after paying a guinea and a 
half for tea last evening, and lodging and breakfast, a 
coach included, not however to carry me a greater 
distance than from your house to our own. The gentlemen all took less expensive lodgings than mine, 
excepting Dr. Clark, who tarried with us. He said 
he would not quit us until we were fixed in our 
present hotel ; the direction to which is " Osborne's 
New Family Hotel, Adelphi, at Mrs. Sheffield's, 
No. 6 -" Here we have a handsome drawing-room, 
genteelly furnished, and a large lodging-room. We 
are furnished with a cook, chambermaid, waiter, &c, 
for three guineas a week ; but in this is not included 
a mouthful of victuals or drink, all of which is to be 
paid for separately. 
</p><p>
Friday, 24 July. 
</p><p>
I have little time for writing now, I have so 
many visiters. I hardly know how to think myself 
out of my own country, I see so many Americans 
about me. The first persons who called to see me 
after my arrival here, were Mr. Jackson, Mr. Winslow Warren, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Ward Boylston, Mrs. 
Atkinson, and yesterday morning before I had breakfasted, (for the fashionable hours of the city had 
taken hold of me, not out of choice but necessity ; 
Miss A. having a hairdresser. I had directed breakfast at nine o'clock ; it was ten, however, but those 
were early visiting hours for this fine city, yet,) whilst 
I was bi'eakfasting, who should be announced to me 
but Parson Walter and Mrs. Hallowell ? l both appeared very glad to see me. Mrs. Hallowell treated 
me with her old affability and engaged me to dine 
with her to-day ; " not," says she, " to a feast, for 
we make none ; but to an unceremonious family 
dinner. Luxury," says she, " is the mode, but we 
know, too, how to practise frugality and economy." 
I am not a little surprised to find dress, unless 
upon public occasions, so little regarded here. The 
gentlemen are very plainly dressed, and the ladies 
much less so than with us. 'T is true, you must put 
a hoop on and have your hair dressed, but a common 
straw hat, no cap, with only a ribbon upon the crown, 
is thought dress sufficient to go into company. Muslins are much in taste ; no silks but lutestrings worn ; 
but send not to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> for any article you want ; 
you may purchase any thing you can name much 
lower in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. I went yesterday into Cheapside 
to purchase a few articles, but found every thing 
higher than in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Silks are in a particular 
manner so ; they say, when they are exported, there 
is a drawback upon them which makes them lower 
with us. Our country, alas, our country ! they are 
extravagant to astonishment in entertainments compared with what Mr. Smith and Mr. Storer tell me 
of this. You will not find at a gentleman's table 
more than two dishes of meat, though invited 
several days beforehand. Mrs. Atkinson went out 
with me yesterday, and Mrs. Hay, to the shops. I 
returned and dined with Mrs. Atkinson, by her invitation the evening before, in company with Mr. 
Smith, Mrs. Hay, Mr. Appleton. We had a turbot, 
a soup, and a roast leg of lamb, with a cherry pie. 
I was more gratified by the social, friendly style in 
which I was treated, than if a sumptuous feast had 
been set before me. Mr. Gorharn, a Dr. Parker, Mr. 
Bromfield, and a Mr. Murray from the Hague, came 
to see me yesterday morning ; and, when I returned 
last evening, I found cards left by a number of gentlemen, some of whom I knew, others I did not ; but, 
knowing <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>, and being Americans, they 
called to make their compliments. Prentice Cushing 
I met with yesterday at Mr. A.'s. I am going to-day 
to see Mr. Copley's pictures. I am told he has an excellent likeness of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>. Mr. Murray informed 
me, that he left <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> last Friday excessively 
anxious for my arrival. He had removed Mr. Dumas and family in expectation of my coming. He 
says, John, with whom he went to the Hague, was 
melancholy when Callaghan arrived without me, and 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> more so. T have sent to-day by the post, 
to acquaint him with my being here, but hope every 
hour to see him or Master John. 
</p><p>
The wind has prevented the arrival of the post. 
The city of <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> is pleasanter than I expected ; 
the buildings more regular, the streets much wider, 
and more sunshine than I thought to have found ; 
but this, they tell me, is the pleasantest season to 
be in the city. At my lodgings I am as quiet as at 
any place in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; nor do I feel as if it could be 
any other place than <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. Dr. Clark visits us 
every day ; says he cannot feel at home anywhere 
else ; declares he has not seen a handsome woman 
since he came into the city ; that every old woman looks like Mrs. H , and every young one like 
like the D 1. They paint here nearly as much 
as in France, but with more art. The head-dress 
disfigures them in the eye of an American. I have 
seen many ladies, but not one elegant one since I 
came ; there is not to me that neatness in their appearance, which you see in our ladies. 
</p><p>
The American ladies are much admired here by 
the gentlemen, I am told, and in truth I wonder not 
at it. O, my country, my country ! preserve, preserve the little purity and simplicity of manners you 
yet possess. Believe me, they are jewels of inestimable value ; the softness, peculiarly characteristic 
of our sex, and which is so pleasing to the gentlemen, is wholly laid aside here for the masculine 
attire and manners of Amazonians. 
</p><p>
This moment a very polite card is delivered me 
from Mrs. Hallowell, desiring me to remove my 
looVincrs to her house whilst I continue in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> ; 
to which I have replied, with thanks, excusing myself, that I am very well accommodated, and in 
hourly expectation of my son ; not the less obliged, 
however, by her politeness. Mr. Elworthy I have 
not yet seen, though I have had several messages 
from him. This is not owing to inattention in him, 
but to being informed that every thing was done for 
me before my arrival, which I stood in need of. Our 
ship is not yet got up the Channel ; w T hat a time we 
should have had of it, if we had not landed. Mr. 
Smith expects to sail on Monday or Tuesday ; I shall 
keep open this letter until he goes ; let sister Shaw 
see it, and read such parts as you think proper to 
the rest of our friends ; but do not let it go out of 
your hands. I shall not have time to write to the 
rest of my friends ; they must not think hardly of 
me ; I could only repeat what I have here written, 
and I think it is best to have the whole budget together ; besides, Abby writes to all her acquaintance, which must answer for me. Remember me 
to them all ; first, to my dear and aged parent, 1 to 
whom present my duty ; to Dr. Tufts, to my aunt, 
to uncle <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, to Mr. Wibird, to all my friends 
and neighbours. 
</p><p>
Sunday Morning, 25 July. 
</p><p>
I went yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Storer and 
Mr. Smith, to Mr. Copley's, to see <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s 
picture. 1 This, I am told, was taken at the request 
of Mr. Copley, and belongs to him. It is a fulllength picture, very large, and a very good likeness. 
Before him stands the globe ; in his hand a map of 
Europe ; at a small distance, two female figures, 
representing Peace and Innocence. It is a most 
beautiful painting. From thence, we went to what 
is called Mr. Copley's exhibition. Here is the 
celebrated picture, representing the death of Lord 
Chatham in the House of Commons ; his three sons 
around him, each with strong expressions of grief 
and agitation in his countenance. Every member 
is crowding around him with a mixture of surprise and 
distress. I saw in this picture, what I have every day 
noticed since I came here, a strong likeness of some 
American or other; and I can scarcely persuade 
mvseif that I have not seen this person, that, and the 
other, before, their countenances appear so familiar 
to me, and so strongly mark our own descent. 
There was another painting, which struck me more 
than this. It is the death of Major Pierson, the particular account of which I enclose to you. I never 
saw painting more expressive than this. I looked 
upon it until I was faint ; you can scarcely believe 
but you hear the groans of the sergeant, who is 
</p><p>
This picture is now in possession of the University at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>. wounded, and holding the handkerchief to his side, 
whilst the blood streams over his hand. Grief, despair, and terror are strongly marked, whilst he 
grows pale and faint with loss of blood. The officers 
are holding Major Pierson in their arms, who is 
mortally wounded, and the black servant has levelled his piece at the officer who killed him. The 
distress in the countenances of the women, who are 
flying, one of whom has a baby in her arms, is 
beautifully represented ; but descriptions of these 
things give you but a faint resemblance of what in 
reality they are. 
</p><p>
From thence I went to see the celebrated Mrs. 
Wright, Messrs. Storer and Smith accompanying 
us. Upon my entrance, (my name being sent 
up,) she ran to the door, and caught me by the 
hand ; " Why, is it really and in truth Mrs. 
Adams ? and that your daughter ? Why, you dear 
soul you, how young you look. "Well, I am glad to 
see you. All of you Americans ? Well, I must kiss 
you all." Having passed the ceremony upon me 
and Abby, she runs to the gentlemen. " I make no 
distinction," says she, and gave them a hearty buss; 
from which we would all rather have been excused, 
for her appearance is quite the slattern. " I love 
everybody that comes from America," says she ; 
" here," running to her desk, " is a card I had from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> ; I am quite proud of it ; he came to see 
me, and made me a noble present. Dear creature, 
I design to have his head. There," says she, pointing to an old man and woman, who were sitting in 
one corner of the room, " are my old father and 
mother ; don't be ashamed of them because they 
look so. They were good folks ;" (these were their 
figures in wax- work ;) " they turned Quakers, and 
never would let their children eat meat, and that is 
the reason we were all so ingenious ; you had heard 
of the ingenious Mrs. Wright in America, I suppose ? " In this manner she ran on for half an hour. 
Her person and countenance resemble an old maiden 
in your neighbourhood, Nelly Penniman, except that 
one is neat, the other the queen of sluts, and her 
tongue runs like Unity Badlam's. There was an 
old clergyman sitting reading a paper in the middle 
of the room ; and, though I went prepared to see 
strong representations of real life, I was effectually 
deceived in this figure for ten minutes, and was 
finally told that it was only wax. From Mrs. 
Wright's I returned to my hotel, dressed, and at four 
went to dine with Mrs. Hallowell. Mr. H. had in the 
morning been to see me, and Mr. Thomas Boylston, 
both of whom urged me to take up my lodgings 
with Mrs. Hallowell. I chose to decline, but went 
and dined with them. Here I found Parson Walter. 
We had a handsome dinner of salt fish, pea soup, 
boiled fowl and tongue, roast and fried lamb, with a 
pudding and fruit. This was a little in the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
style. Messrs. Smith and Storer dined with us. Mr. 
Hallowell lives handsomely, but not in that splendor 
which he did in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. On Sunday, I engaged to take a coach for the day, which is only twelve-andsixpence sterling, and go to church at the Foundling 
Hospital. Messrs. Atkinson, Smith, and Storer with me. 
</p><p>
Monday Morning. 
</p><p>
Well, my clear sister, if you are not tired with 
following me, I will carry you to the Foundling 
Hospital, where I attended divine service yesterday 
morning. Really glad I was that I could, after so 
lono- an absence, again tread the courts of the Most 
High, and I hope I felt not unthankful for the mercies I had received. 
</p><p>
This hospital is a large, elegant building, situated 
in a spot as airy, and much more beautiful than 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Common. The chapel, which is upon the 
second floor, is as large as what is called the Old 
South with us. There is one row of galleries ; upon 
the floor of this chapel there are rows of seats like 
Concert Hall, and the pulpit is a small ornamented 
box, near the centre. There were about two thousand persons, as near as I could guess, who attended. 
In the gallery, opposite to where I sat, was the 
organ loft ; upon each side an alcove, with seats, 
which run up like a pyramid. Here the foundlings 
sat, upon one side the boys, upon the other the girls, 
all in uniform ; none appeared under five, nor any 
older than twelve. About three hundred attended 
the service. The uniform of the boys was a brown 
cloth, with a red collar, and a red stripe upon the 
shoulder. The girls were in brown, with a red sirdie round the waist, a checked stomacher and apron ; 
sleeves turned up, and white cloth caps with a 
narrow lace, clean and neat as wax ; their governesses attended with them. They performed the 
vocal music ; one man and woman upon each side 
the organ, who sung an anthem ; both blind, and 
educated at this foundling hospital. When we came 
down, we went into the dining-rooms, which were 
upon each side of the ascent into the chapel ; here 
the tables were all arranged, and the little creatures 
curtseying and smiling ; some as sweet children as 
ever you saw. There is an inscription over the 
door, in gold letters ; " Can a mother forget her sucking child," &c. In a hall are placed the pictures 
of many noted benefactors and founders of this institution. (I should have mentioned that the chapel 
windows are painted glass ; the arms and names of 
the most distinguished benefactors are in the different squares of the glass.) We were shown into 
their bed-chambers, which are long, airy chambers, 
with ten or fifteen windows in each, and about fifty 
or sixty beds, placed in rows upon each side, covered with blue and white furniture check. At the 
head of the chamber is a bed for the governess. 
When you have seen one of them, you have a specimen of the whole. 
</p><p>
I dined with Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson, in company 
with Messrs. Jackson, Smith, &c. Mr. Atkinson is a 
very modest, worthy man, and Mrs. Atkinson a most 
amiable woman. You see no parade, no ceremony. 
I am treated with all the kindness of a sister, in as 
easy a way as I could wish. As I took the carriage 
for the day, after forenoon service, we rode out to 
see Mrs. Atkinson's twins, who are at nurse at 
Islington, about two miles from the city. It is a 
fine ride. We went through a number of the great 
squares. Portland Square is one of the finest. In 
short, the representations, which you and I amused 
ourselves with looking at not long ago, are very 
near the life. When we returned, we dined, and at 
six o'clock went to the Magdalen Hospital, which is 
three miles from where I dined ; for this is a monstrous great city. We were admitted with a ticket. 
This assembly was very full and crowded. Yet no 
children or servants are admitted. In short, I begin 
to hope that this people are more serious and religious than I feared they were. There is great 
decorum and decency observed. Here are only 
two small galleries, which hold the unhappy beings 
who are the subjects of this merciful institution. 
Those who attend the service are placed upon seats 
below, like Concert Hall. The building is about as 
large again as <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> church, in a most delightful situation, surrounded by weeping willows. All 
the public buildings here have large open spaces 
around them, except those churches which are in 
the heart of the city. I observed, upon going in, a 
gallery before me, raised very high, and covered 
with green canvass. Here sat these unhappy 
women, screened from public view. You can discern them through the canvass, but not enough to 
distinguish countenances. I admired the delicacy 
of this thought. The singing was all performed by 
these females, accompanied with the organ ; the 
melancholy melody of their voices, the solemn 
sound of the orcran, the serious and afTectino; discourse of the preacher, together with the humiliating objects before me, drew tears from my eyes. 
The chapel to these apartments is always in the 
heart of the building ; the dining, working, and 
lodging apartments surround them. 
</p><p>
Returned about eight o'clock ; found many cards 
left for me ; some from Virginians, some from 
Marylanders, some from Connecticut. Colonel 
Trumbull has called twice upon me, but I was so 
unfortunate as not to be at home. Amongst the 
Americans who called yesterday to see me during 
my absence, was Mr. Joy. He left his name and 
direction, with a polite billet, inviting me to dine 
with him on Tuesday, if I was not engaged ; and, if 
I was, the first day I was disengaged. I have replied to him that I will wait upon him on Wednesday. Invited by Mr. Murray to the play this 
evening ; declined going, in hopes my best friend 
will be here to attend me very soon ; besides, have 
no clothes yet which will do. No mail from Holland yet arrived ; the wind has been so contrary 
that two are now due. Dr. Clark, our constant and 
daily visiter, is just come in to drink tea with me. 
Messrs. Smith and Storer are here great part of the 
day. Captain Lyde did not get up the Channel 
until Sunday, so that I have no occasion to repent 
landing when I did ; contrary winds and bad weather prevented his coming up only with the tide ; his 
vessel, too, had like to have been sunk by a collier running foul of him. They did him a good 
deal of damage ; these are vessels that take pleasure in injuring others. He told me many dismal 
stories about coming up the Channel, which made 
me determined to land at any rate. 
</p><p>
On Saturday, Mr. Elworthy called upon me, and 
tendered me any service I could wish for. I thanked him, but Messrs. Smith and Storer and Dr. Clark 
render any other assistance unnecessary, as any 
and all of them are ready and willing to oblige me. 
On Sunday morning, Mr. and Mrs. Elworthy came 
to see me. She is a very agreeable woman, and looks 
like one of us, that is, she had more of our American neatness about her than any lady I have seen ; 
for I am yet so impolite as not to be reconciled to 
the jaunty appearance and the elegant stoop. There 
is a rage of fashion which prevails here with despotic sway ; the color and kind of silk must be attended to, and the day for putting it on and off; no fancy 
to be exercised, but it is the fashion, and that is argument sufficient to put one in or out of countenance. 
I am coming on half-way. I breakfast at nine, and 
dine at three, when at home ; but I rise at six. I am 
not obliged to conform in that ; the other hours I am 
forced to submit to, upon account of company. This 
morning, Dr. Clark and Colonel Trumbull are to 
breakfast with me. I long for the hour, when I shall 
set off for the Hague, or see <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> here. I 
meet with so many acquaintances, that I shall feel 
loth to quit the city upon that account. There 
are no Americans in Holland, and the language will 
prevent any sociability but what I find in my own 
family ; but, having a house, garden, and servants 
at command, feeling at home will in some measure 
compensate for the rest. I have a journey of eighty 
miles to make, to Margate, before I can embark ; 
and, as soon as <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> arrives, I suppose we 
must go to France. I have not executed your orders 
with regard to satin, because, upon inquiry, I find 
you can buy cheaper with you. I have not found 
any thing, except shoes, that are lower ; such a satin 
as my black, you must give as much sterling for a 
yard, as I gave lawful money ; no silks but lutestring, and those which are thinner, are worn at this 
season ; mode cloaks, muslin and sarsnet, gauze 
hats, bonnets, and ribbons, every thing as light 
and thin as possible, different gowns and skirts, 
muslin skirts, flounced chintz, with borders white, 
with a trimming that looks like gartering ; the silk, 
which is most in taste, is what is called " new-mown 
hay," the pattern I enclose ; and this part of the 
letter is for the tasty folks of my acquaintance. Mr. 
Smith brings home a specimen of the newest fashioned hats. 
</p><p>
Tuesday Morning. 
</p><p>
Determined to tarry at home to-day, and see company. Mr. Joy came in and spent an hour. He is 
the same pleasing man you formerly knew him ; 
that bashful diffidence is supplied by manly confidence, and acquaintance with the world has given 
ease and politeness to his manners. He really is 
quite the accomplished gentleman, bears a very good 
character, has made a great deal of money, and 
married a Yorkshire lady of handsome fortune 
about three months since. He again repeated his 
invitation to me to dine with him, accompanied by 
Mr. Smith. To-morrow, I go. Many gentlemen 
have called upon me this forenoon, so that I have 
only time to dress before dinner, which I order at an 
earlier hour than the <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> fashion. At three is 
my hour, and breakfast at nine. I cannot dine 
earlier, because from nine till three I am subject 
to company. From the hours of three till five and 
six, I am generally alone, or only Mr. Smith, or Mr. 
Storer here, to whom I am never denied. The servant will frequently come and ask me if I am at home. 
</p><p>
Wednesday. 
</p><p>
I have walked out to-day, for the first time, and a 
jaunt Mr. Storer has led me. I shall not get the 
better of it for a week. The walking is very easy 
here, the sides of the street being wholly of flat 
stones ; and the <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> ladies walk a great deal, and 
very fast. My walk out and in was only four miles ; 
judge you then, what an effect it had upon me. I 
was engaged to dine out. I got home at one, but 
was obliged to lie upon the bed an hour, and have 
not recovered from it yet. 
</p><p>
At four, I was obliged to go out. Mr. Joy lives 
three miles from where I lodge. The house in which 
he lives is very elegant, not large, but an air of taste 
and neatness is seen in every apartment. We were 
shown into the drawing-room, where he awaited us 
at the door, and introduced us to his lady and her 
sister. She is quite young, delicate as a lily, modest 
and diffident, not a <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> lady by any means. 
After we had dined, which was in company with 
five American gentlemen, we retired to the drawingroom, and there I talked off the lady's reserve, and 
she appeared agreeable. Her dress pleased me, 
and answered to the universal neatness of the apartments, furniture, and entertainment. It was a delicate blue and white copper-plate calico, with a blue 
lutestring skirt, flounced ; a muslin apron and handkerchief, which are much more worn than gauze ; 
her hair, a fine black, dressed without powder, with 
a fashionable cap, and straw ribbons upon her head 
and breast, with a green morocco slipper. Our dinner consisted of fried fish of a small kind, a boiled 
ham, a fillet of veal, a pair of roast ducks, an almond pudding, currants and gooseberries, which in 
this country are very fine. Painted muslin is much 
worn here ; a straw hat with a deep crown, lined, 
and a white, green, or any colored ribbon you choose. 
I returned, and found a number of cards left by 
gentlemen who had called during my absence. Tomorrow I am invited to dine again with Mr. Atkinson 
and ladv. I feel almost ashamed to so again, but, 
not being otherwise engaged, they insist upon it. It 
is a thanksgiving day for the peace. I design to 
hear Mr. Duche, who officiates at the Asylum or 
Orphan House. 
</p><p>
Thursday.
 
I found myself so unwell, that I could not venture 
to-day into a crowded assembly. My walk yesterday gave me a pain in my head, and stiffened me so 
that I can scarcely move. Abby, too, has the <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> cold, which they say every body experiences, 
who comes here ; but Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson would 
not excuse my dining with them, and Charles came 
for us. We went and found the same friendly, 
hospitable attention, nothing more on account of 
the day, a neat, pretty dinner, consisting of two 
dishes and vegetables. After dinner, returned the 
visit of Mr. and Mrs. Elworthy, who were very glad 
to see me. Mr. Elworthy carried us to Drapers' 
Hall. This is a magnificent building, belonging to 
a company of that people, to which is a most 
beautiful garden. To walk in some of these places, 
you would think yourself in a land of enchantment. 
It would just suit my dear Betsy's romantic fancy. 
Tell her I design very soon to write to her. It shall 
be a description of some pretty scene at the Hague ; 
and Lucy shall have a Parisian letter ; but, writing 
to one, I think I am writing to you all. 
Friday. 
</p><p>
To-day, my dear sister, I have determined upon 
tarrying at home, in hopes of seeing my son 
or his papa ; but, from a hint dropped by Mr. Murray, I rather think it will be my son, as political 
reasons will prevent <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s journey here. 
Whilst I am writing, a servant in the family runs 
puffing in, as if he were really interested in the matter ; " Young <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> is come." " Where, where 
is he ? " we all cried out. " In the other house, 
Madam ; he stopped to get his hair dressed." Impatient enough I was ; yet, when he entered, we had so 
many strangers, that I drew back, not really believing my eyes, till he cried out, " 0, my mamma 
and my dear sister ! " Nothing but the eyes, at first 
sight, appeared what he once was. His appearance 
is that of a man, and in his countenance the most 
perfect good humor ; his conversation by no means 
denies his stature. I think you do not approve the 
word feelings, but I know not what to substitute in 
lieu, or even to describe mine. His sister, he says, 
he should have known in any part of the world. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> chooses I should come to the Hague 
and travel with him from thence ; and says it is the 
first journey he ever looked forward to with pleasure, 
since he came abroad. I wish to set out on Friday ; 
but, as we are obliged to purchase a carriage, and 
many other matters to do, Master John thinks we 
cannot go until the Tuesday after. In the mean 
time, I shall visit the curiosities of the city ; not 
feeling twenty years younger, as my best friend says 
he does, but feeling myself exceedingly matronly 
with a grown up son on one hand, and daughter 
upon the other, and, were I not their mother, I would 
say a likelier pair you will seldom see in a summer's 
day. You must supply words where you find them 
wanting, and imagine what I have left unfinished, 
for my letter is swelled to such a bulk that I have 
not even time to peruse it. Mr. Smith goes to-morrow 
morning, and I must now close, requesting you to 
make the distribution of the little matters I send, as 
directed. Tell Dr. Tufts, my dear and valued uncle 
and friend, that I design to write to him by the next 
vessel. 
</p><p>
Particularly remember me to uncle <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, to 
Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> and Nancy, and to all my dear <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> 
friends. Tell Mr. Storer, that Charles is very good 
to me, and that, walking with Abby, the other day, 
she was taken for his wife. Ask him if he consents. 
Mr. and Mrs. Atkinson treat me like a sister. I cannot find myself in a strange land. I shall experience 
this, when I get to a country the language of which 
I cannot speak. I sincerely wish the treaty might 
have been concerted here. I have a partiality for 
this country ; but, where my treasure is, there shall 
my heart go. 
</p><p>
I know not when to close ; you must write often 
to me, and get uncle Smith to cover to Mr. Atkinson ; 
then, wherever I am, the letters will come safe. 
</p><p>
Adieu, once more, my dear sister, and believe me 
</p><p>
Most affectionately yours. 
</p><p>
A. A.
