You have my ardent and sincere wishes for your safe and speedy 
junction with our common friends. Our cause is good ; the cause of 
humanity itself, and as it would be blasphemy in the highest degree, 
to think a Good Being would create human nature to make it unhappy, 
and countenance its being deprived of those natural rights without 
which our existence would not be tolerable; our cause may, therefore, be 
justly called the cause of God also. These were my sentiments at the 
time of the Stamp Act, the beginning of our dispute, they have continued 
to be so ever since, and with the blessing of God, I am ready and willing 
to undergo any thing Heaven may still think proper to call me to suffer 
in support of it. We are tried, but I firmly trust not given over, and 
that God will once more restore us to our country and our rights, and 
that soon, when we shall have reason to look up to Him, and be convinced that his correction has been necessary, kind and proper, such as 
no father in our quandam circumstances could avoid giving to his children, unless he had totally delivered them up to their own wild and 
perverse imaginations, and abandoned us altogether. That we may 
pursue every prudent, reasonable, humble and truly political step, devoid 
of passion and vindictive resolutions is my warmest wish, Revenue is 
below a brave man; vengeance belongeth to the Almighty; He has 
claimed it expressly as His right, wisely foreseeing the shocking havoc 
man would make with such a weapon left to his discretion. However, 
a just retaliation, upon an abandoned and cruel enemy, may be some 
times absolutely necessary and unavoidable, but then that necessity 
should glaringly appear, be used sparingly and with propriety, that is, 
as near as possible on the offenders themselves. This even humanity 
may require ; might show steadiness and firmness, and would meet the 
approbation of all the candid part of mankind. Instead of bayoneting 
poor soldiers for the cruelty of their officers, when we have them at our 
mercy when the unexampled cruel treatment of our friends in their 
power absolutely required a return, and when they have unjustly tortured or taken away the lives of any of them, a retaliation in such cases, 
in my humble opinion, would be much better taken of the officers; I 
would save them in the field, and immediately hang a few of the heads 
of them on the lines, in presence of the soldiers taken with them declaring publicly the reasons why it was done, and afterwards if the enemy s 
lines were near, offer them the bodies of such officers to honor them 
with what funeral they thought proper. The higher the rank of the 
officer that fell into our hands, the nearer should we come to and 
punish the cause of the cruelties our friends had suffered, and in my 
opinion show the greater spirit and propriety in taking such a method, 
and the sooner prevent the repetition of their barbarities. Even Lord 
Cornwallis himself, if Fame says true, has been guilty of numberless 
cruelties, in cold blood, and if he fell into our hands, it would be the 
highest justice to make him suffer in an exemplary manner for them.

You will let our friends know our situation, and that though perhaps 
they cannot without great inconvenience detain all the prisoners they take, and are, perhaps, obliged, from peculiar circumstances, to parole 
must have been the case heretofore, yet such miscreants as have acted in high stations, have done us great mischief 
by the example of their defection, and otherwise are continually playing 
us tricks, and by no means are to be trusted, we hope they will for our 
sakes, keep such perfidous wretches at such a distance from Charlestown, 
and parolled if they think proper, at least, where they can do no more 
mischief. This, common fellow-feeling for our friends absolutely requires ; indeed, a contrary conduct will encourage these worst of enernies, and make them contrive to throw themselves artfully in the way 
to be captured that they may carry on their cool, sly, detestable villainy 
with more security. I beg pardon, my dear friend, for troubling you 
with this long scrawl. My love to all our friends; tell them I hope to 
be with them soon, and to set out from hence as soon as possible after 
my family arrives the beginning of next month at farthest ; particularly make my compliments to Gen. Marion. I am much obliged to 
him for his friendship at my plantation on Black River; entreat he 
will continue it. If you cannot see him, contrive, if you can, to let him 
know it. If any thing from thence, by his means or through any of 
my other friends, can be transmitted to my family here, it would be of 
great service to them, and what they will stand in need of.

I am, dear sir, your most affectionate humble servant,

P. S. Poor Kriapp should not be forgot. His firmness and integrity 
under the severe trials we have been witness to, entitle him to particular 
attention.
