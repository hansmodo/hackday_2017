MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have now before me your Favours of Oct. i, 18. 23. 30. 
and Nov. 5, which I shall answer in order. 
</p><p>
I wonder to hear that my Friends were backward in bringing you my Letters when they arrived, and think it must be a 
mere Imagination of yours, the Effect of some melancholy 
Humour you happened then to be in. I condole with you sincerely on poor Debby's Account, and hope she got well to 
her Husband with her two Children. 
</p><p>
You say in yours of Oct. 18, "For me to give you any Uneasiness about your Affairs here, would be of no Service, and 
I shall not at this time enter on it." I am made by this to 
apprehend that something is amiss, and perhaps have more 
Uneasiness from the Uncertainty, than I should have had if 
you had told me what it was. I wish therefore you would 
be explicit in your next. I rejoice that my good old Friend, 
Mr. Coleman, is got safe home, and continues well. Upon 
what you write me now about the Watches, I shall, if I can 
afford it, send you another for yourself. I say if I find I can 
afford it; for I understand the Ballance of the Post Office 
Account which I must pay here, is greatly against me, owing 
to the large Sums you have received. I do not doubt your 
having applied them properly, and I only mention it, that if 
I do not send you a Watch, it will not be thro' Neglect or for 
want of Regard, but because I cannot spare the Cash, for I 
shall not like to leave Debts behind me here. Mrs. Stevens's 
Bills since her Marriage have been accepted as before, I 
should have mention'd it if they had not. Sally Franklin 
whom you inquire after is here at present under Mrs. Stevenson's care, but I expect her Father to fetch her soon. She 
presents her Duty. 
</p><p>
Remember me respectfully to Mr. Rhodes, <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>, 
Mr. Roberts, Mr. and Mrs. Duffield, Neighbour Thomson, 
Dr. and Mrs. Redman, Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Duche', Dr. 
Morgan, Mr. Hopkinson, and all the other Friends you have 
from time to time mention'd as enquiring after me. As you 
ask me, I can assure you, that I do really intend, God willing, 
to return in the Summer, and that as soon as possible after 
seeing and settling Matters with Mr. Foxcroft, whom I 
expect in April or May. I am glad that you find so much 
reason to be satisfy'd with Mr. Bache. I hope all will prove 
for the best. Capt. Falkener has been arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> 
some time, but the Winds being contrary could get no farther, 
so I have not yet received the Apples, Meal, &c., and fear 
they will be spoilt. I send with this, some of the new kind of 
Oats much admir'd here to make Oatmeal of, and for other 
Uses, as being free from Huskes; and some Swiss Barley 
6 Rows to an Ear : perhaps our Friends may like to try them, 
and you may distribute the Seed among them. Give some 
to Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Thomson, Mr. Bartram, 
our Son, and others. 
</p><p>
I cannot comprehend how so very sluggish a Creature as 
Ben. Mecom is grown, can maintain in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> so large 
a Family. I hope they do not hang upon you : for really as 
we grow old and must grow more helpless, we shall find we 
have nothing to spare. 
</p><p>
I hope the Cold you complain of in two of your Letters 
went off without any ill Consequences. We are, as you observe, blest with a great Share of Health considering our 
Years now 63. For my own part, I think of late that my Constitution rather mends: I have had but one Touch of the 
Gout, and that a light one, since I left you ; It was just after 
my Arrival here, so that this is the 4th Winter I have been 
free. Walking a great deal tires me less than it used to do. 
I feel stronger and more active. Yet I would not have you 
think that I fancy I shall grow young again. I know that 
men of my Bulk often fail suddenly : I know that according 
to the Course of Nature I cannot at most continue much longer, 
and that the living even of another Day is uncertain. I there
fore now form no Schemes, but such as are of immediate Execution; indulging myself in no future Prospect except one, 
that of returning to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, there to spend the Evening 
of Life with my Friends and Family. 
</p><p>
Mr. and Mrs. Strahan, & Mr. and Mrs. West, when I last 
saw them, desired to be kindly remembred to you. Mrs. 
Stevenson and our Polly send their Love. Mr. Coombe, who 
seems a very agreable young Man, lodges with us for the 
present. Adieu, my dear Debby. I am, as ever, your 
affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
