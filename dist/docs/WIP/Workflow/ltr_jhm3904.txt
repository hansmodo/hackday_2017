SIR: 
</p><p>
The manner in which you mentioned Mr. P , gave me no kind of apprehension of his being on the confiscation list, therefore, wrote to 
you respecting him as one of those who had not been noticed by the 
Legislature. I am, however, very glad you have proceeded no further, 
and this mistake of mine will serve to make me more guarded in future. 
</p><p>
It is utterly out of my power to grant Mr. P any indulgence, as 
the Act in which he is included is clear and positive. Were I to suffer 
him to remain in the country, it would be a partial suspension of the law, which cannot be done; I must, therefore, desire that Mr. P 
be immediately ordered into Charlestown. An application has lately been 
made me in favor of Mr. Alex. Rose, who had been banished the town 
by the British, but I was obliged to refuse it; and, if Mr. Rose should 
come out, you must order him immediately to return. Before this 
reaches you, you will have received my order for the arms and ammunition you want. My reason for ordering the horses to be returned that 
were impressed by order of Col. Maham, was, that <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> horses were 
to be turned over to his regiment. I thought it impossible that more 
horses could be wanted, after having those of a whole regiment. I am 
sorry to find that this regiment has proved so very insignificant, as not 
to be able to supply more than twelve horses ; however, Maham's order 
was for no more than fifteen, which makes a difference of only three 
horses, consequently the service cannot suffer for want of so trifling a 
number of horses. Another reason was, that I found the authority 
put into very improper hands, instead of its being entrusted to very 
discreet persons. The thing in itself is odious, and ought to be avoided 
if possible ; but, if such a necessity arises as renders the measure in
dispensable, it ought to be exercised with caution and lenity. If I am 
rightly informed, the gentlemen who had the press warrant did, by no 
means, confine themselves to taking horses from such only as showed no 
disposition to serve their country; and another reason that induced me 
to countermand the order was, that I found it created very great discontents, to find that horses, which were immediately to be attached to 
your brigade, should be taken out of another; and, as it was likely to 
be productive of many inconveniences, and having already full enough 
to struggle with, and not conceiving the horses to be substantially necessary, I thought it best to put a stop to any further embarrassments on 
this account. As to Col. Maham's threatening to resign, because he is 
not permitted to do as he is pleases, he must use his own pleasure. I 
can assure him these kind of threats are by no means calculated to 
operate with me in the manrer they are intended to do, but the reverse. 
I am very sorry to find so few of the Charlestown militia at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. 
There is now a newspaper regularly published. Suppose you issue 
general orders for those men to join their several corps within a certain 
limited time, and such as do not, to send a party to take them into custody; and if, on trial, they are convicted, send them to the Continental 
line a few examples, perhaps, may bring them to their senses. It is 
disgraceful in the highest degree that men should require to be thus 
goaded to their duty. An express is this day arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and brings letters from Gillon, who is arrived at the Havanna with five 
prizes, worth 150,000 hard dollars. It is not unlikely he may send a 
vessel or two to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> therefore, could wish a good look-out may 
be kept there, that if they arrive they may not be detained for want of 
a pilot. They talk much at the Northward of the French fleet coming 
either here or to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, early this spring. Let either be the object, 
the issue will be highly important. I could wish Charlestown to be the 
first, not only as most interesting to us, but because I believe the 
attempt here would be successful, and I have very great doubts about 
the other; and, because I fear if our allies were to meet with a rebuff 
in one place, they will not be so ready to attempt another, as success is 
always a stimulus to encounter new dangers. I suppose you will think 
I have little to do, to write so much about politics this is not the fact; 
but my pen naturally run into its old channel before I recollected my 
self. I wish I had time to give you these occurrences oftener than I 
do; however, if you will give me leave, I will subscribe to our news 
paper for you, from whence you will stand a better chance of getting 
JQ^WS than from ray pen. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
