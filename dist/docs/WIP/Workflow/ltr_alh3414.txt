I was among the first who were convinced that an administration by single men was essential to the proper 
management of the affairs of this country. I am persuaded 
it is the only resource we have to extricate ourselves from 
the distresses which threaten the subversion of our cause. 
It is palpable that the people have lost all confidence in our 
public councils, and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are 
as well apprized as myself, that our friends in Europe are 
in the same disposition. I have been in a situation that 
has enabled me to obtain a better idea of this than most 
others, and I venture to assert, that the court of France 
will never give half the succours to this country while congress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, 
which they would grant if these were entrusted to individuals of established reputation, and conspicuous for probity, 
abilities, and fortune. 
With respect to ourselves, there is so manifest and rooted 
a diffidence of the government, that if we could be assured 
the future measures of congress would be dictated by the 
most perfect wisdom and public spirit, there would be stiH 
a necessity for a change in the forms of our administration, 
to give a new spring and current to the passions and hopes 
of the people. To me it appears evident, that an executive 
ministry, composed of men wjth the qualifications I have 
described, would speedily restore the credit of government 
abroad and at home ; would induce our allies to great exertions in our behalf; would inspire confidence in moneyed 
men in Europe, as well as in America, to lend us those 
sums of which it may be demonstrated we stand in need, 
from the disproportion of our national wealth to the expenses of the war. 
</p><p>
I hope, sir, you will not consider it a compliment, when 
I assure you that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of 
your nomination to the department of finance. 
</p><p>
In a letter of mine last summer to Mr. Duane, urging, 
among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I 
mentioned you as the person who ought to fill that department. I know of no other in America who unites so many 
advantages ; and, of course, every impediment to your acceptance is to me a subject of chagrin. I flatter myself, 
congress will not preclude the public from your services, by 
an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions ; and as one 
deeply interested in the event, I am happy in believing you 
will not easily be discouraged from undertaking an office, 
by which you may render America and the world no less a service than the establishment of American independence. 'Tis by introducing order into our finances, by restoring 
public credit, not by gaining battles, that we are finally to 
attain our object. 'Tis by putting ourselves in a condition 
to continue the war, not by temporary, violent, and unnatural efforts to bring it to a decisive issue, that we shall in 
reality bring it to a speedy and successful one. In the 
frankness of truth, I believe, sir, you are the man best capable of performing this great work. 
</p><p>
In expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and 
that you will ultimately act on terms you approve, I take 
the liberty to submit to you some ideas, relative to the objects of your department. I pretend not to be an able 
financier. It is a part of administration which has been 
least in my way, and of course has least occupied my inquiries and reflections ; neither have I had leisure or materials 
to make accurate calculations. I have been obliged to depend on memory for important facts, for want of the authorities from which they are drawn. 
</p><p>
With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily 
be crude and defective ; but it may be a basis for something 
more perfect, or if it contains any hints that may be of use 
to you, the trouble I have taken myself, or may give you, 
will not be misapplied. At any rate, the confidence I have 
in your judgement, assures me that you will receive with 
pleasure communications of this sort. If they contain any 
thing useful, they will promote your views, and the public 
benefit ; if not , the only evil is the trouble of reading them ; 
and the best informed will frequently derive lights even 
from the reveries of projectors and quacks. There is scarcely 
any plan so bad as not to have something good in it. I trust 
mine to your candour, with this apology, you will at least 
do justice to my intention. 
</p><p>
With these preliminary remarks, he proceeds to the inquiry as to " what ought to be done in the finances of the 
United States ?" First, to estimate its capacity for revenue, and the proportion between its abilities and its wants, 
by examining the proportion the revenues other countries 
have borne to their wealth, and applying the rule to America. Second, by comparing the result of that rule with the 
product of taxes in those states which have been most earnest in taxation. 
</p><p>
The result obtained, by an examination applied to Great 
Britain, France, and the United Provinces was, that the revenue is one fourth of the circulating cash in commercial 
countries, so far as this is a just representative of its labour 
and commodities. 
</p><p>
He then states the current cash of America, previous to 
the war, to have been about thirty millions of dollars, of 
which one eighth was specie ; and that the proper revenue, 
at that time, was seven and a half million of dollars. But 
as the system of taxation was carried to an extreme in those 
countries, that the rule is inapplicable in its full extent to 
the United States ; though a much larger amount than might 
be expected, could be levied during the war, without burthening the poorer classes, from the greater equality of fortunes, and a more equal division of the public burthens. 
Making the necessary qualifications, he arrives at the result, that the present revenue was one fifth less than it had 
been before the war. Having adverted to the causes of the 
diminished circulation, which he considers as principally 
artificial, he comes to the conclusion, allowing for the diminution of foreign trade, and the loss of territory, that the 
states have a nett revenue of six millions of dollars ; a result which is nearly confirmed by a detailed examination of 
the previous product of the taxes, of which Massachusetts 
was supposed to have raised one fifth. 
</p><p>
Taking this as the amount of revenue, he next proceeds 
to ascertain, by general rules, the military capacity of the 
country, which although it had at times risen to thirty thousand men, might be estimated at twenty thousand. The 
expenses incident to the support of which force, with the 
necessary civil expenditures, rendering the amount of the 
annual charges of the countiy less than eleven million of 
dollars, left a deficit of four and a half millions to be supplied 
by credit, foreign or domestic. He then examines the prospect from foreign loans, which taking into view the political and financial embarrassments of France, he supposes 
may justify an expectation of a loan annually of eight or ten 
million of livres, which would only meet a third of the national wants. 
</p><p>
From Spain, after remarking on her cold and passive 
policy, in pursuance of which the bills drawn on her, though 
not rejected, had not been paid, he expects nothing. 
Their method of prosecuting the war, can scarcely be resolved into Spanish supineness, but seems to have a more 
corrupt original. A bigotted prince, governed by a greedy 
confessor, is a character on which little dependence can be 
placed," 
</p><p>
Holland, as a government, stands in need of all its credit 
for its own uses. But from the Dutch capitalists much 
might be expected, though not on the faith of the United 
States, by the establishment of a system such as he is about 
to propose. The prospects of internal loans to government, both from the want of confidence, and the more advantageous terms of traffic in which individual wealth could 
be employed, he rates very low. 
</p><p>
"To surmount these obstacles," he observes, "and give 
individuals ability and inclination to lend, a plan might be 
devised which, by incorporating their means together, and 
uniting them with those of the public, will, on the foundation of that incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit 
that will supply the defect of moneyed capital, and answer 
all the purposes of cash. A plan which will not only advance the interest of the lenders, secure the independence 
of their country, and in its progress have the most beneficial influence upon its future commerce, but be a source of 
national strength and wealth. I mean," he says, " the institution of a national bank. This I regard, in some shape 
or other, as an expedient essential to our safety and suecess, unless by a happy turn of European affairs, the war 
should speedily terminate, in a manner upon which it would 
be unwise to reckon. There is no other that can give to 
government that extensive and systematic credit, which the 
defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to 
its operations. The longer it is delayed, the more difficult 
it becomes. Our affairs grow every day more relaxed and 
more involved. Public credit hastens to a more irretrievable 
catastrophe. The means for executing the plan are exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making 
in Massachusetts, would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on which the bank must stand. 
</p><p>
I am aware of all the objections that have been made to 
public banks, and that they are not without enlightened and 
respectable opponents. But all that has been said against 
them only tends to prove, that like all other good things, 
they are subject to abuse, and when abused, become pernicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments, may 
be proved to be injurious. If is certain that the monies 
of South America have had great influence in banishing 
industry from Spain, and sinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce, and riches, or, in other 
words great national prosperity, may, in like manner, be 
denominated evils ; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate ambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, 
and all those vices which corrupt a government, enslave the 
state, and precipitate the ruin of a nation. But no wise 
statesman will reject the good, from an apprehension of the 
ill. The truth is, in human affairs, there is no good, pure 
and unmixed. Every advantage has two sides ; and wisdom consists in availing ourselves of the good, and guarding, as much as possible, against the bad. 
</p><p>
"The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and 
private credit. The former gives power to the state, for 
the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among individuals. 
</p><p>
Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist the 
true wealth and prosperity of a state. 
</p><p>
Most commercial nations have found it necessary to institute banks ; and they have proved to be the happiest engines that ever were invented for advancing trade. Venice, 
Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are examples of 
their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the 
figure they have made at different periods, in a great degree, to this source. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been able to make in so many illustrious and successful wars, essentially to that vast fabric of 
credit, raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone, she 
now menaces our independence. She has indeed abused 
the advantage, and now stands on a precipice. Her example should both persuade and warn us. 'Tis in republics, where banks are most easily established and supported, 
and where they are least liable to abuse. Our situation 
will not expose us to frequent wars, and the public will 
have no temptation to overstrain its credit. 
</p><p>
"In my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have 
no other resource. The long and expensive wars of King 
William had drained England of its specie ; its commerce 
began to droop for want of a proper medium ; its taxes 
were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The administration wisely had recourse to the institution of a bank, 
and it retrieved the national difficulties. We are in the 
same, and still greater want, of a sufficient medium. We 
have little specie ; the paper we have is of small value, and 
rapidly declining to less. We are immersed in a war for 
our existence as a nation, for our liberty and happiness as 
a people. We have no revenues, nor no credit. A bank, 
if practicable, is the only thing that can give us either the one or the other. Besides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution, and the advantages we should 
enjoy from it in common with other nations, our situation, 
relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give us 
some peculiar advantages. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the 
abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it. Some persons, 
disgusted by the depreciation of the money, are chimerical 
enough to imagine it would be beneficial to abolish all paper, and annihilate the whole of what is now in circulation, 
and depend altogether upon specie, both for commerce and 
finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the attempt would be fatal. We have not a competent stock 
of specie in this country, either to answer the purpose of 
circulation in trade, or to serve as a basis for revenue. 
The whole amount of what we have, I am persuaded, does 
not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the circulating 
medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient for the operations of commerce, would be to suppose 
that our domestic and foreign commerce were both reduced 
four-fifths ; a supposition that carries absurdity on the face 
of it. It follows, that if our paper money were destroyed, 
a great part of the transactions of traffic must be carried on 
by barter ; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined ; destructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of 
the paper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree." 
</p><p>
Having shown that if all the specie could be drawn into 
the treasury annually, the consequence of such a measure, 
which never was effected in any country, would be a complete stagnation of business ; and that a recourse to taxes 
in kind, would prove wholly inefficacious, he proceeds to 
observe, 
</p><p>
The error of those who would explode paper money 
altogether, originates in not making proper distinctions. 
Our paper was, in its nature, liable to depreciation, because it had no funds for its support, and was not upheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March, 
1780, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute 
of the latter, which is equally essential. No paper credit 
can be substantial or durable, which has not funds, and 
which does not unite immediately the interest and influence 
of the moneyed men, in its establishment and preservation. 
A credit begun on this basis will, in process of time, greatly 
exceed its funds ; but this requires time, and a well settled 
Opinion in its favour. 'Tis IN A NATIONAL BANK ALONE THAT WE CAN FIND THE INGREDIENTS TO CONSTITUTE A WHOLESOME, SOLID, AND BENEFICIAL PAPER CREDIT." 
</p><p>
The length to which these extracts have extended does 
not warrant the publication more at large of this elaborate 
document. A mere outline of the plan, consisting of twenty articles, is all that will now be given. 
</p><p>
The capital of the bank was to consist of a stock of three 
millions of dollars, divided into thirty thousand shares, to 
be exempted from all taxes and impositions. 
</p><p>
The subscription, according to the respective amounts, 
to be in proportionate quantities of specie, personal, and 
landed securities; the object being to secure the largest 
possible amount of specie. The bank to have all legal 
corporate immunities, and the stock to be protected from 
attachment, making each member of the incorporation liable, by suit, to the extent of his stock. 
</p><p>
The privilege of subscribing for one half of the capital 
stock, to be reserved to the United States, to the particular states, or to foreigners, and the .United States to become conjointly responsible with the private proprietors, 
for all the transactions of the bank, which was to be authorized to issue notes, with and without interest, a part only 
payable in America, the residue in Europe. The aggregate 
of the notes not to exceed the amount of the bank stock ; 
with a power to lend at an interest not to exceed eight percent., and to borrow to the amount of one half of its stock, 
to purchase estates, by principal or by annuities, to have 
the privilege of coining, to the amount of one half of its 
stock, (the quantity of alloy, &c. to be determined by congress,) and to have, also, the power of discounting foreign 
bills of exchange, to receive deposits of plate or money, 
which deposits were to be exempt from taxation, to have 
the right of contracting with the French government, for 
the supply of its fleets and armies in America, and to contract with congress for the supply of their armies, with 
a condition to lend the United States, on a certain unalienable fund of one hundred and ten thousand four hundred 
pounds per annum, the sum of twelve hundred thousand 
pounds, at an interest of eight per cent., payable in twenty 
years, or sooner, at the option of congress, and a similar 
rate to govern all future loans ; for which fund the United 
States, and the individual states, to be severally pledged. 
</p><p>
The bank to become responsible for the redemption of 
all the paper ; the old, at forty for one, in parts of one third, 
at the end of every ten years, with interest at five per 
cent. ; the new, as specie, in six years, so as to fulfil the 
previous engagements of congress ; for which responsibility, adequate funds, payable to the bank, equal to the discharge of the whole paper currency in thirty years, bearing an interest of two per cent., were to be established. 
</p><p>
The bank notes to be received in payment of all public 
customs and taxes, at an equivalent with gold and silver, 
with power to dissolve itself at pleasure, having made 
effectual provision for the payment of its debts. Its stock 
to be transferable. To be chartered for thirty years, and 
no other bank, public or private, to be permitted during 
that period. Three offices to be established, one in each 
of the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, 
to facilitate the circulation and payment of the bank notes ; 
the whole to be managed by twelve general directors, eight 
to be chosen by the private proprietors, and four by congress ; the minister of finance having the privilege of inspecting all their proceedings. 
</p><p>
A full examination of the principles of the proposed institution would exceed the proper limits of this work, but 
a few desultory observations on some of the features of this 
plan, may not be misplaced. 
</p><p>
The introduction of landed security, as a part of the capital stock, is the provision which, in a merely commercial 
view, might perhaps have been deemed most objectionable. 
But it is to be remembered, that commercial convenience 
was merely an incidental consideration. The primary object was similar to that of the bank of England ; after absorbing the previous issues, to obtain a monopoly of the circulation, and by that means to secure a safe and uniform 
currency. 
</p><p>
But had the sole purpose of <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> been the 
granting facilities to trade, it is by no means obvious that 
his plan would have been less effective. 
</p><p>
It is true, that the country would not furnish an adequate 
amount of specie, or of equivalent available personal securities to fill the stock ; and that for this reason, the deficiency was sought to be supplied by landed security. But 
this landed security, though less readily convertible than 
the government debt of England, which forms the basis of 
its bank, might be pledged for an amount of cash of relative value, and there would still exist the use of the lands, 
and the use of the value of its representative. 
</p><p>
That the landed security was not convertible to meet the 
immediate wants of the bank, would be less objectionable, 
in the minds of those who entertain the opinion, not without 
strong reasons, that the capital of a bank should remain a 
permanent vested fund, upon which to base a credit, not a 
fund to be appropriated to its current uses. 
</p><p>
It is possible that this provision might have diminished 
the number of merely moneyed subscribers ; but as this plan 
was to go into operation, at a time when the prevailing distrust of paper securities would dispose individuals, amidst a 
choice of evils, to prefer an institution which would furnish 
this additional support, to a capital of which the specie component was the most alluring ingredient, this disadvantage 
would have been more than compensated. 
</p><p>
The power of coining money, was introduced merely to 
enable the bank to convert its plate into specie ; but it was 
a power which, under proper checks, might have been extended with advantage. 
</p><p>
The privilege of contracting with the French government, for the supply of its armies, was highly desirable 
from this consideration, that the greater part of the specie 
was derived from the expenditures of France, and passing 
through the bank, would have increased its credit and efficiency, while the great profits to be derived from the contracts, would have offered large inducements to subscribers. 
</p><p>
The article which rendered the bank responsible for the 
redemption of the existing paper, had in view the importance of relieving the country from a fluctuating medium, 
which infected all credit. The amount of the annuity to 
be secured by congress to the bank, was not fixed, from 
the difficulty of estimating the whole amount of the government issues; a difficulty which was increased by this 
circumstance, that this plan proposed to embrace all the 
State emissions, as essential to every efficient scheme of 
finance, a fact of high interest, in reference to the great 
question of the " Assumption," which threatened an insuperable obstacle to the fiscal system of the present government. 
</p><p>
The permission to the bank to dissolve or sell at pleasure, was introduced to encourage men to adventure in it, from a confidence, that when once engaged, the profits 
would induce them to continue. 
</p><p>
In reply to the inquiry, where funds are to be procured, 
in the present impotent state of the federal government, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> says, " I answer, there are ample means, 
and they must be had. Congress must deal plainly with 
their constituents ; they must tell them that power without 
revenue, is a bubble ; that unless they give them substantial resources of the latter, they will not have enough of 
the former either to prosecute the war, or to maintain the 
union in peace ; that in short, they must, in justice to the 
public, and to their own honour, renounce the vain attempt of carrying on the war without either, a perseverance in which can only deceive the people, and betray 
their safety. They must demand an instant, positive, and 
perpetual investiture of an impost on trade ; a land tax 
and a poll tax to be collected by their own agents. This 
act to become a part of the confederation. It has ever 
been my opinion, that congress ought to have complete sovereignty in all but the mere municipal law of each state, 
and 1 wish to see a CONVENTION OF ALL THE STATES, with 
full power to alter and amend, finally and irrevocably, the 
present futile and senseless confederation." 
' After stating the plan of the bank, " these," he says, " as 
has already been observed, are only intended as outlines. 
The form of administration for the bank, and all other matters, may be easily determined. If the leading principles 
are once approved, we shall find good models in the different European banks, which we can accommodate to our circumstances. Great care, in particular, should be employed 
to guard against counterfeits ; and, I think, methods may 
be devised that will be effectual. 
</p><p>
I see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of 
this kind, but a distrust of the final success of the war, which 
may make men afraid to risk any considerable part of their 
fortunes in the public funds ; but without being an enthusiast, I will venture to assert, that with such a resource as 
is here proposed, the loss of our independence is impossible. 
All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband 
the army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to 
create in the people a general disgust and alarm, which may 
make them clamour for peace on any terms. But if a judicious administration of our finances, assisted by a bank, 
takes place, and the ancient security of property is restored, 
no convulsion is to be apprehended ; our opposition will 
soon assume an aspect of system and vigour, that will relieve and encourage the people, and put an end to the hopes 
of the enemy. 'Tis evident, they have it not in their power to subdue us by force of arms ; in all these states they 
have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor is 
it possible for them much to augment this number. The 
East and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the 
islands they have not, at this time, above five thousand men ; 
a force not more than equal to the proper garrisoning of 
Jamaica alone, and which, the moment they lose a maritime 
superiority in those seas, will leave them much cause to fear 
for their possessions. They will probably send out fifteen 
hundred or two thousand men to recruit their regiments 
already here, but this is the utmost they can do. 
</p><p>
"Our allies have five thousand men at Rhode-Island, 
which in the worst event that can happen, will be recruited to eight, to co-operate with us on a defensive plan. 
Should our army amount to no more than fifteen thousand 
men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion 
of the enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling 
them to renounce their offensive, and content themselves 
with maintaining one or two capital points. This is on the 
supposition, that the public have the means of putting their 
troops in activity. By stopping the progress of their conquests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgraceful defensive, we destroy the national expectation of success, from which the ministry draw their resources. They 
are in a situation, where the want of splendid successes is 
ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme 
boundary ; they have mortgaged all their funds ; they have 
a large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which is 
funded. This must necessarily create apprehensions in 
their most sanguine partizans, and if these are not counteracted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot 
much longer continue the delusion. Indeed, in that case, I 
suppose they must themselves despair. The game we play, 
is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have calculated, 
in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous 
side ; many events may turn up in the course of the summer, 
to make even the present campaign decisive."
