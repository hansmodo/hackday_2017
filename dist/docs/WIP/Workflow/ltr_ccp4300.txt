Dear General, 
</p><p>
South Carolina has ratified the Federal Constitution. 
Our Convention assembled the 12th instant, and yesterday the vote of ratification was taken ; - one hundred and forty-nine ayes, and seventy-three noes. I 
inclose you a list of the members who voted on each side. You will be pleased to find, that the names you are best acquainted with were in favor of the 
Constitution, and that those who were against it have declared they would do all in their power to 
reconcile their constituents to its adoption, and would exert themselves in its support. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Pinckney joins me in tendering our best respects to Mrs. Washington and yourself, and to Major Washington and his lady ; and I remain, 
</p><p>
With sincere gratitude, for all your favors, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=ccp" rel="me">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a>.

P. S. Major Butler, out of a principle of delicacy too refined, declined serving in the State Convention. You will not therefore see his name among the yeas or nays.
