Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The opposition of Virginia, and of her offspring, Kentucky, appears bolder and more considerable than I had 
apprehended. The reform that seems to have taken place 
in the Carolinas is, however, a consoling and important 
circumstance. I have been inclined to believe that the 
Congressional election was the principal object of these 
inflammatory proceedings, which discredit and injure us so 
much abroad, and when passed, that these States would 
display less turbulence.

According to present appearances, the war must recommence between France and Austria, if it has not already 
begun ; but that an honest and solid confederacy against 
France is likely to take place between the great powers, is 
more than I dare even to expect. Russia is uncommonly 
zealous. Passawan Ouglou has accepted pardon and promotion ; and it is just now said, how accurately is another point, that Prussia and Austria are to lay aside their mutual 
jealousy, and to consult and act together for their common safety.

The commercial condition of England is extremely prosperous, and not withstanding the hazardous and really dreadful situation of Ireland, this country is united in an uncommon degree, and appears resolved to persevere in the war. 
The minister, at the opening of his budget, estimates the 
total income of all the people of Great Britain at a hundred 
million per annum ; and it is confidently expected, that the 
taxes of this year will considerably exceed one-third of this 
sum.

The Directory lately hold a language respecting America 
more moderate, but not less artful and dangerous. Whether any change in their privateering laws will be made, I 
think uncertain ; if my conjectures respecting the view's of 
the Directory are correct, these laws will be new modified, 
or at least for a time suspended. After the experience we 
have had, it will be humiliating if we are deceived by the 
artifices that will be practised among our people. 
I am always and sincerely, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient and faithful servant,
