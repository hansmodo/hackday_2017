Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I went to dine with the Count de Montmorin,  
and expressed to him my wish that France might seize the 
present moment to establish a liberal system of commercial 
policy for her colonies. I observed, that her interest was 
deeply at stake, because America could always dispose of the 
Islands, and would naturally wish to see them in possession 
of that power, under whose government they would be most 
advantageous to her. That nothing could tend so much to 
make the United States desirous of an alliance with Britain, 
as to exclude them from a free trade with the French colonies. 
That, if the metropolis wishes to preserve the affection of her 
distant subjects, and to derive from them the greatest commercial benefit, she ought to suffer them to draw their subsistence from that quarter, where they can obtain it most cheaply. He assured me, that he was fully of my opinion ; said 
that our position rendered it proper to make in our favor an 
exception from their general system respecting other nations, 
and that he hoped, within a fortnight, something might be done. 
But he lamented, as he had done before, that they have no 
chief minister, and consequently no fixed plan nor principles. 
I shall see him again before I depart, and also <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De La Luzerne</a>, within whose department this matter regularly lies. 
He is an adherent to the exclusive system, which is unfortunate. 
</p><p>
In the National Assembly, also, there is a considerable difficulty. Among the most violent of the violent party, are some 
representatives of cities on the western coasts of this kingdom, 
where the chief commerce is with the Islands; and those 
who wish for the closest union with America, do not wish to 
offend these gentlemen; and therefore are desirous of waving 
the matter at present. For my own, I am very desirous that 
the business should be put in train, at least. If successful, so 
much the better  7 but at any rate, it will give an alarm on the 
other side of the channel. If either of these rival nations sets 
the example, the other will soon follow ; and although it is not 
very clear, that the actings and doings of the Assembles Nationale in general will long endure, yet whatever they 
grant to us in this particular business, those who come after 
them will be fearful of retracting. Under these impressions, 
for a long time past, I have been endeavoring to smooth the 
way towards our object, and I believe in the success. 
I am, &tc.
