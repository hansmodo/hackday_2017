DEAR GENERAL : 
</p><p>
I have just received your letter of the 5th. I am sorry the enemy 
is so situated as to give them an opportunity to carry off the produce of 
the country, without your having it in your power to injure them. 
Cannot small parties interrupt them, or is there any move that we can 
make that may tend to dislodge them. Great preparations are making 
in Charlestown for the evacuation of the place. I am persuaded it 
will take place soon, and the more scanty we can render their supplies 
of provisions, the sooner it will happen, and the fewer negroes they will 
have in their power to take with them. I am glad you have got through 
the disagreeable business of uniting Maham's and Hampton's corps. 
In the present form I am in hopes they will be useful. Should the enemy 
leave Santee, you will cross the river and move towards the Cooper. 
But it is necessary I should inform you that the enemy are advised of 
my wishes on this head, having taken Mr. Singleton with a number of 
letters among others, one for you. With respect to the beef collectors, 
I am a stranger to it. We have no Commissaries of our own, they are 
all under the government of Mr. Hort, and by him appointed. But I 
should not suppose these people will dare to rise in the present situation of things, and it is necessary they should contribute to the support 
of the army as well as other parts of the State. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
