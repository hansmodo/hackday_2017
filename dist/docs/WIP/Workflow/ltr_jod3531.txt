THE French consul had agreed to carry me, Mr. Dana, Mr. Allen, and my three children and our three 
servants, this day to <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a>, which is about five 
leagues from this place, by water, in a barge of four 
teen oars, but the weather proved so boisterous that 
it was impossible to go. 
</p><p>
To give you some idea of the place where we are, 
Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortegal are two long arms 
of land stretched out into the sea, which embrace a 
large body of water. Within this bay are two other 
points of land, within one of which is <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a>, where 
we now are, and within the other is <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a>, where 
we intended to have gone this day, if the weather had 
permitted ; but we hope to go tomorrow. We can 
get neither horses, nor mules, nor carriages, in this 
place, for ourselves or our baggage, which I am much 
surprised at, as it is so grand a port. Living and conveniences for conveyance are very dear in this place, 
which will run my expenses very high. There is 
nothing remarkable here but the natural strength of 
the place and the artificial fortifications, together with 
the arsenals, dry docks, barracks and military matters by sea and land. The city is small, not very 
well built nor accommodated. Very little commerce 
or manufactures, industry or diversions. There are 
two or three elegant churches, and there is an Italian 
opera. There is the appearance of much devotion, 
and there are many ecclesiastics.

It is dull enough to be in a country, so wholly ignorant of the language and usages ; but we have furnished ourselves with a dictionary and grammar, and 
are learning every hour. Charles is much pleased 
with what he sees and hears, and behaves very discreetly. John is writing to you and his sister and 
brother. I excused myself from dining today on 
board the Souverain and on board the Jason, two 
French men-of-war. Yesterday I dined on board the Triomphant, and the children on board the Jason. 
The French officers appear today with cockades in 
honor of the triple alliance a large white ribbon 
for the French, a smaller red one for the Spaniards, 
and a black one for the Americans, which makes a 
pretty appearance.

Upon looking a little into the Spanish language, I 
find it so very nearly like the Latin, that I am persuaded we shall learn more of it in a month than we 
did of French in half a year. The manners of the 
Spaniards and French are as opposite as grave and 
gay. The dress of the Spanish officers is much like 
the French. That of the people a little different. 
Men and women, gentlemen and ladies, are very fond 
of long hair, which often reaches, braided in a queue 
or bound round with a black ribbon, almost to their 
hams. The ladies wear cloaks, black or white, which 
come over their heads and shoulders and reach down 
to their waists. They have fine black eyes, and con 
sequently dark, but yet lively complexions.

When, O when shall I see you again and live in 
peace ? 
</p><p>
The Russian ambassador lately appointed to relieve 
the one lately in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, passed through France and 
was a fortnight or three weeks at Paris, from whence 
the shrewd politicians have conjectured that peace 
was about to be mediated by that power. But it is 
said that England is as reluctant to acknowledge the 
independence of America as to cede Gibraltar, the 
last of which is insisted upon as well as the first. 
But this is only bruit.

Adieu.
