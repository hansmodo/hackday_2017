Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's letter of yesterday, 
and am very glad that you have ordered up the 
troops which are to compose the garrison, as it is 
very necessary they should be here, that things may 
be got into some kind of order before the winter. 
At present, they are very much deranged. The laying in a proper stock of fire-wood is a very heavy, 
but a very essential business, and the militia, which 
have been employed in cutting it, I am told, have 
done little more than supply the post at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, 
and are very little ahead. I expect a report of the 
quantity to-day from Colonel Hughes, to whom I 
have recommended to allot them a moderate task per 
day, as the best means to make them most useful. 
</p><p>
The magazine of provisions is very nearly exhausted; thirty barrels only of salted meat on hand, exclusive of what is in the works (about five days' for 
the troops posted in them), and no cattle, and the 
men have been some days reduced to three quarters 
of a pound of flour. I expect, however, two hundred 
barrels of that article to-day, and have written to 
Colonel Hay (to be laid before the Legislature of 
this State), very pressingly, to have an immediate 
and ample supply of provisions thrown in, as it may 
not be possible to do it some time hence, from the 
state the river is frequently in, about the beginning 
of winter. 
</p><p>
I directed Colonel Livingston to collect and send 
up here all the boats that were not necessary below, 
provided they had not been ordered there by your Excellency for some particular purpose. His answer 
is, that they were ordered there for transporting the 
cannon, in case it became necessary to evacuate the 
posts he commands. They will therefore remain there 
unless I have your directions to the contrary j hut I 
must beg leave to suggest to your Excellency that, 
after the intention of the enemy becomes apparent 
with respect to them, it will most probably be too 
late to evacuate them with any probability of saving 
the cannon and stores. If they be evacuated before 
their intention is discovered, it will be in their power 
to occupy them, after they may have failed in an 
attempt upon this place. I find some heavy brass 
field-artillery here, which is not, I suppose, intended 
for garrison use, and had better be removed. Some 
repairs have been making upon the carriages, but 
that might as well be done anywhere else. The 
Pennsvlvania brigade shall march as soon as the 
other troops arrive. 
</p><p>
The times of the militia begin to expire on the 
14th, and will all be expired on the 24th. I have 
not heard from Major Tallmadge, nor have any accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> by any other way. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
