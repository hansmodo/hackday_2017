SIR, 
</p><p>
Threescore years did the oppressed United Provinces 
maintain a war in defence of their liberties against the then 
powerful kingdom of Spain, with all the wealth of the Indies 
at its command; and finally obliged to acknowledge their 
independency in a formal treaty, sitting down with the loss 
of territory, treasure and reputation, and with a broken 
strength that has never since been recovered. 
</p><p>
Contractors, jobbing mercantile members of parliament, 
officers starving on half pay, and gunsmiths who toast, as 
the papers tell us, a speedy and a perpetual war, may wish, 
rather than no war at all, for a civil one in America. These 
in all conversations, to encourage us in undertaking it, 
slight the strength of those distant people, think nothing of 
that enthusiasm for liberty, which in other countries and ages 
has supplied all deficiencies, and enabled a weak people to 
baffle the efforts of a stronger ; but tell us that half a dozen 
regiments are sufficient to reduce in less than a year every 
province on the continent. Half a dozen being once engaged in this blessed service, it is easy to write and shew the 
necessity for more : The more there are the greater the profits to those gentry. And whatever becomes of us poor devils 
that live by manufactures or by trade, that are to pay taxes, 
or that have money in the funds, they will amass fortunes, 
buy our estates, bribe our boroughs, and vote in parliament 
the rectitude of the measure. 
</p><p>
I believe our officers and soldiers as brave as any in the 
world; and from that very opinion of their bravery I conjecture they would not generally relish the being ordered on 
this murdering service against their countrymen; to shed 
English blood, to stifle the British spirit of liberty now rising 
in the Colonies ; that LIBERTY which we should rather wish 
to see nourished and preserved there, as on a loss of it here 
(which from our vices is perhaps not far distant) we or our 
posterity may have occasion to resort to and participate of; 
and possibly some of the ablest officers may choose, with 
Sir Jeffery Amherst, rather to resign their commissions. But 
whatever may be the bravery and military powers of our 
troops, and whatever the zeal with which they would proceed 
in such a war, there are reasons that make me suspect that 
it will not be so soon terminated as some folks would have 
us believe. 
</p><p>
My reasons are drawn chiefly from a computation founded 
on facts. It is well known that America is a country full of 
forests, mountains, &c. That in such a country a small 
irregular force can give abundance of trouble to a regular 
one that is much greater: And that, in the last war, one of 
the fifteen Colonies we now have there (and one far short 
of being the strongest) held out five years against twenty-five thousand British regular troops; joined by twenty-five 
thousand Colonists on their own pay, and aided by a strong 
fleet of men of war. What the expence was to this nation, 
our treasury books and augmented debt may shew. The 
expence to America, as their pay was higher, could not be 
much less. The Colony we made war upon was indeed aided 
by France, but during the whole contest not with more than 
five thousand men. Now supposing that the twenty-five 
thousand Colonists, that then joined us, should hereafter 
be against us, and that this makes no difference, and considering that instead of one Colony to conquer, we are to have 
fifteen, and that possibly some of our good neighbours may 
think of making a diversion in their favour, I apprehend it 
not out of the way to allow five years still to a Colony ; and 
this by my computation, will amount to just seventy five 
years. I hope Messieurs the company of gunsmiths will for 
the present be so good as to be content with a civil war of 
seventy-five years, and perhaps we may scarce be able to 
afford them a perpetual one. 
</p><p>
And what are we to gain by this war, by which our trade 
and manufactures are to be ruined, our strength divided 
and diminished, our debt increased, and our reputation, as 
a generous nation, and lovers of liberty, given up and lost? 
Why, we are to convert millions of the King's loyal subjects 
into rebels, for the sake of establishing a new claimed power 
in P to tax a distant people, whose abilities and circumstances they cannot be acquainted with, who have a 
constitutional power of taxing themselves; who have never 
refused to give us voluntarily more than we can ever expect 
</p><p>
to wrest from them by force; and by our trade with whom 
we gain millions a year ! 
</p><p>
And is there not one wise and good man to be found in 
Britain, who can propose some conciliating measure that 
may prevent this terrible mischief? I fear not one. For
