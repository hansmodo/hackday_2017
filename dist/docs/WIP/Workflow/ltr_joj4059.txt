Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
By this time, I suppose there is much canvassing for 
foreign appointments. I thank you for thinking of me, but 
as I mean to return in the spring, your arrangements, so 
far as respects me, must be altered. Upon this point I am 
decided, and beg of you to tell my friends so. 
</p><p>
Orders are gone to evacuate New- York. The present 
British ministry are duped, I believe, by an opinion of our 
not having decision and energy sufficient to regulate our 
trade, so as to retaliate their restrictions. Our ports were 
opened too soon. Let us, however, be temperate as well 
as firm. 
</p><p>
Our friend Morris, I suspect, is not a favourite of this 
court. They say, he treats them as his cashier. They 
refuse absolutely to supply more money. Marbois writes 
tittle-tattle, and I believe does mischief. Congress certainly should remove to some interior town, and they should send a minister forthwith to England. The French 
ambassador at Petersburg has thrown cold water on Dana's being received before a pi ace. 
</p><p>
The ministers of this court are qualified to act the part of Proteus. The nation, I think, is with us, and the king 
seems to be well disposed. Adieu. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
