My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This letter will accompany the duplicate of my last to Mr Jefferson, of the 6th of March. Be so kind, I pray you, as to 
let me know which of my letters are missing. I presume 
there must be great chasms in my correspondence, as I have 
received the acknowledgement of very few of my letters; and 
yet I have written always by duplicates, frequently by triplicates and quadruplicates. 
</p><p>
Permit me, my dear Sir, to congratulate you on your 
appointment. It is honorable to you, and will, I believe, be 
useful to the United States. The more so, as your convictions 
respecting our form of government will restore that harmony 
to our Executive departments, a want of which gave much 
pleasure to the enemies of America. I flatter myself also, that 
your habits of attention to business will produce a more 
active correspondence with the public servants abroad. 
</p><p>
Mr Jefferson desired me some time ago to mark the state of 
depreciation to him ; which I continued to do, but omitted in 
my last, because it continued nearly in the same situation as 
when I last communicated it. The fact is, that there is now 
no certain or steady rate, because, as you will see by the gazettes, dealers in that business are frequently guillotined. 
There is no foreign exchange, and in purchases very little, if 
any, allowance would be made on payments in specie ; and 
yet bullion is higher than it was before the Assignats were 
issued. The exact rate I do not know. Louis d ors, I am 
told, are much higher than they were, owing, as I have formerly mentioned, to the greater facility of concealing or transporting them. 
</p><p>
I have long since pointed out the danger of something very 
like a famine, which has indeed in many parts put on its most 
distressing forms. Men have literally expired for the want 
of food, with the means of buying it in their possession, could 
it have been bought. Luckily, or rather providentially, the 
season advances with a rapidity scarcely ever experienced. I 
have rye in the ear, and sanfoin in blossom. It is true, that 
the sandy soil contributes to push forward vegetation ; but still 
it is a phenomenon. Apricots as large as a pigeon's egg in the 
middle of April, and that in the latitude of forty-eight to forty-nine. These facts, which, in common cases, would be more 
properly communicated to an agricultural society than to a 
Minister of State, are of vast importance, for the great bulk of 
this nation live chiefly on vegetable substances ; and in the 
south, where the scarcity was greatest, I presume, from what 
I see here, that the earth begins to furnish a tolerable support 
to its inhabitants. A frost, such as we experienced in the end 
of last May, would do more towards the starvation system, 
than all the armies and fleets in Europe. 
</p><p>
In my last, I mentioned that the King of Prussia persisted 
in the alliance, although he intended to be paid for his efforts. 
I am still of the same opinion, though it is confidently asserted 
that he means to withdraw, leaving only his contingent as a 
co-estate of the Empire. His past conduct gives no room to 
suppose, that a sacred regard to engagements taken would 
prevent him from abandoning his allies ; but I think there is 
the stronger tie of a common interest. Austria and England, 
particularly the latter, are more pointedly interested than he. 
I conclude, therefore, that the business will wind up by a good 
round subsidy, (perhaps a million sterling,) and inconsequence 
of it a very large body of Prussian troops added to the army 
in Flanders. 
</p><p>
By garrisoning a few posts along the Rhine, and leaving 
the country exposed to incursion, the allies will force the 
German militia to defend themselves ; and as to the ravages 
which may be committed, a few consolatory phrases will, per 
haps, be the only compensation, which the sufferers will ever 
receive. If this conception of the business be just, the Prussian Cabinet will keep up the idea, that it means to recall its 
army, until the last moment, and those armies will then 
turn off to the left into the Low Countries, or perhaps be 
transported by water. Something or other of an extraordinary 
nature is in agitation o~ both sides, for the armies have been 
long looking at each other, without striking or even aiming a 
blow. I have no doubt but the Allies count on the public 
discontents here, and certainly they have some foundation ; 
but as, on their side, there is no one chief who can act decisively, or form solid engagements for the whole alliance, it 
is not possible to take that advantage of those discontents, which certainly would not escape the intelligent mind of a Caesar or an Alexander. 
</p><p>
In the course of my correspondence with your predecessor, 
I have endeavored to communicate to him my views of men 
and things, and to prepare his mind for events, which appeared to me probable, and which have in due course of time 
taken place. This is what I conceived to be one of the 
most important duties of my station ; and if I have not 
been more full and particular, it is because the names 
of those, who, in their turn, were to rule and to perish, seemed to me of secondary moment ; and because, 
judging, in my lamentable dearth of intelligence, from such 
feeble lights as I could collect in scattered rays from different quarters, it seemed to me that my letters would 
have been more acceptable, had I been deceived as to facts 
and probabilities, or capable of communicating sentiments 
and opinions I did not entertain. 
</p><p>
It has appeared to me, that Paris decides for the whole of 
France, and that the Sans Culottes (alias populace) decide 
for Paris ; that, of course, factions would continually arise, 
waging inexplicable war with each other, and that the 
momentary influence of each, being founded on fear only, 
could not take on any stable form, or possess any durable 
existence ; that each new stroke of the guillotine would 
weaken the force of liberal sentiment, and, consequently, 
diminish the chances of a free system. 
</p><p>
I must repeat here, that plots and conspiracies are not to 
be attributed to the genius and temper of those who plot and 
conspire, but to the state of society ; for it would be, I think, 
inconsequent, to imagine that in a given number of individuals, born in different countries or places, there should be a 
very great disproportion of talents and qualities. It seems 
more regular to believe, that in a virtuous and just society, 
the good qualities which exist are drawn into action, and the 
bad repressed by despair of success ; while, on the contrary, 
in a depraved and vicious society, the good must remain inactive for the want of confidence and support, while the bad, 
released from the fear of shame, and prompted by cupidity or 
ambition, count on the submission of the society, if they ac 
quire the means of inspiring fear into the great mass, of which 
each individual pursues his personal interest unrestrained by 
moral principle. 
</p><p>
After this preface, which might better, perhaps, have been 
spared, -I proceed to mention, that many different schemes 
were, I think, carrying on to destroy the existent government. 
As to the idea that foreign powers excited the parties, I am 
not disposed either to adopt or reject it. I do not consider it 
as being at all r necessary to the formation of a conspiracy, al 
though very necessary to the destruction of those engaged in 
it. I explain ; the pride of the nation will at any time rouse 
them from the perfect insensibility with which they would 
behold the Convention, and all its Committees, thrown into 
the river ; and therefore it is useful to rouse that pride, by stating every attempt to overturn the government as originating 
with the foreign foe. And I remark here, that in the different 
reports made respecting these conspiracies, and the accusations against those engaged in them, it is as it were taken for 
granted, that the people would quietly submit to those, who 
by a coup de main should put themselves in possession of self 
created power. 
</p><p>
I do not say that this is true, but I have no doubt that a 
certain duration of general terror, as the basis of a system of 
government, must inevitably produce that effect. The period 
of duration, required for any particular nation, will depend 
somewhat on the national character, but more on the morality 
of the people. To reason therefore a priori on the subject, 
our ideas must take on as much of an algebraic as logical 
form. 
</p><p>
In examining historical facts, on the contrary, we are too apt, 
I think, to ascribe to individuals the events which are produced 
by general causes. The two factions lately crushed may be 
called the Dantonist and Hebertist. I should more readily 
attribute to the latter, than to the former, a connexion with foreign powers. I have strong reasons to believe that Danton 
feared from them, and hoped from those who destroyed him. 
The Hebertists, however, may be considered, I think, as the 
Anti-Conventional, and the Dantonists as the Royal, faction. I 
except always the Aristocrats, who are in fact null., and who 
in the various changes which impend will, I am persuaded, 
have very little, if any, share. The more ardent spirits among 
them flew off long ago, either into foreign countries or the Vendee. I speak in generals, not universals. Those who remain 
are of that waxen substance called the men of property, who 
in foreign wars count so much, and civil wars so little. 
</p><p>
Danton always believed, and, what is worse as to himself 
at least, always maintained, that a popular system of government 
for this country was absurd ; that the people were too ignorant, too inconstant, and too corrupt to support a legal administration 5 that, habituated to obey, they required a master ; and 
that, even had they been educated in the principles of freedom, and joined to the energy of sentiment the force of habit, 
yet like ancient Rome they had reached the period in which Cato was a madman, and Caesar a necessary evil. His conduct was in perfect unison with those principles when he acted ; but he was too voluptuous for his ambition, too indolent 
to acquire supreme power. Moreover, his object seems rather 
to have been great wealth, than great fame. He has fallen 
at the feet of Robespierre. 
</p><p>
As to the Hebertists, whatever may have been the ultimate 
view of some, I presume that the greater number had nothing 
more in view, than a second edition of the 31st of last May. 
The destruction of all these Chiefs has given great power to 
the Comite de Salut Public, whose monthly renewal is so 
much a thing of course, that they may be considered as a permanent body. Hence it follows, that the next considerable 
party ought to arise there. The Hebertists believed the Convention to be so low in public opinion, that they could overturn 
it without the aid of its own members. They were deceived, 
or at least they were anticipated. The Dantonists supposed, 
that in the want of respect for their rulers, the people would 
readily turn on the little prisoner in the temple, that enthusiastic sentiment so congenial to the heart of man, so essential 
to that which beats in a French bosom. They also were anticipated ; but if they judged rightly, they have unveiled a 
dreadful mystery. 
</p><p>
Some one observed the other day, in conversation, that 
all the men of the tenth of August have passed away already, 
and those also of the second of September. It is certain that 
the tenth of August is chiefly to ba attributed to Westermann, 
one of those lately guillotined, and that Danton was among 
the prime movers of the scenes of September. The reason for 
that massacre will be found, perhaps, in the old adage, dead 
men tell no tales. Oliver Cromwell understood well the value 
of mob sentiment, when he replied to his chaplain, vain of the 
applauding crowd which thronged round his master's coach, 
there would be as many, and as glad, to attend me at the gal 
lows. t do not believe that a good man in America can feel 
all the force of that expression ; and, therefore, I believe it is 
very difficult to form on certain subjects a just opinion. 
</p><p>
You will ask, perhaps, whether these factions are totally 
crushed, and whether, if so, similar factions are likely to arise. 
T think I have anticipated that question ; and the general re 
flections, which, perhaps, have already fatigued you, contained 
the anticipated reply. I will not, therefore, repeat ; and, be 
sides, in the vast field of conjecture, each man is free to take 
the path which his judgment may direct, or inclination choose. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly mentioned the embargo at Bordeaux. 
Mr Fenwick, our Consul, came on lately to solicit redress on 
behalf of all the neutrals concerned, being furnished with the 
special powers of the other Consuls. Previous to his arrival, I 
had written to the Minister a letter of the eighth of last month, 
of which I enclose a copy. Mr Fenwick, after a sedulous 
attendance on the Comite de Salut Public, was so happy as to 
obtain a decision. By the bye, the Charge d Affaires of Den 
mark told me last December, that he was confidentially informed, that the embargo would not be taken off till the month of 
April.

In the course of the investigations, which lately took place 
respecting plots and conspiracies, some of the Ministers were 
arrested, and among them the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The 
system also is changed, as you will see by the gazettes, so that 
in future these agents are to be in name what they were be 
fore in fact. The Charge. Provisoire of the department of 
Foreign Affairs has sent me a copy of the arrete of the Comite de 
Salut Public, of which, as well as of his note and my reply, you 
will find copies enclosed. I also enclose a short correspondence with the Charge d Affaires of Malta. I have, &c.
