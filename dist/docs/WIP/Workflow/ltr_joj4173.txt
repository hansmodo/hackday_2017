Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 25th November. 
Although the privations you voluntarily submit to, exceed 
the " ne quid nimis" of the wise man, they evince a sound 
mind, and will, I hope, tend to preserve it long in a sound 
body.

My inquiries respecting speltz were in terms too general. 
To sow wheat here is like taking a ticket in a lottery ; 
more blanks than prizes. The fly destroys more than we 
reap. A substitute, therefore, is desirable ; and if speltz, like: 
rye, escapes the ravages of that insect, it might be a good 
one. 1 did not recollect that it required a particular process 
for cleaning. As we have no mill here adapted to that 
purpose, it would be useless to introduce it. 
</p><p>
From your description of the rye sent to you from 
France, it appears far to exceed the kind we have. 1 wish 
that instead of dividing it. you had sowed the whole in your 
own ground, and distributed parcels <>t the increase. It is 
said that the quality of rye depends greatly on that of the 
soil. The prevailing opinion here is, that the rye of this 
country is all of one and the same species, and yet in some 
parts the rye bread is excellent, and in others black and 
strong. The weight and quality of the rye you mention 
lead me to suspect that it is of another species, or a distinct 
variety. I doubt there being danger of its depreciating, 
unless sown too near our own, or in particular cases of 
neglect. I know but of one kind of grain which, notwithstanding good management, depreciates here ; and that 
is oats. 
</p><p>
I am glad your second volume will soon be published. 
I expect to read it with pleasure, especially as there has 
been a hand in it which can make a " goose-quill" diffuse 
the " utile" and the " dulce" through many a page. I suppose a number will be printed for sale; if so, be so good 
as to desire the bookseller to send for me six sets. I mean 
to place a set in our town library, and to distribute others 
among certain persons in the neighbourhood, who, in my 
opinion, would make a proper use of them. 
</p><p>
Among the accounts you received from Doctor Logan, 
there are some which I did not expect, particularly those 
which respect the relative state of the manufactures and 
agriculture of England. In the present violent fluctuation 
of European affairs, it does not appear to me extraordinary 
that bullion should occasionally be scarce, and paper depreciate even in England. I suspect it to be merely occasional 
and transient, for I have heard of no adequate cause which 
could produce and continue to produce such effects. That 
nation, I am persuaded, wish to be and remain on friendly 
terms with us. I have some reason to believe that the idea 
of "dividing" is not a new one. If the micrometer is practically accurate, the inventor has done more than I should 
have expected. 
</p><p>
Civil discord, it seems, is assigning to Spanish America 
a part in the prodigious tragedy now exhibiting on the theatre of the world. We have seen and heard of strange 
things, and unless you should take your " French leave" 
before the curtain drops, you will doubtless see and hear of 
many more. I expect to take my leave more deliberately, 
but probably more early. Be that as it may, it is a comfortable reflection, that when we do, hope will be the only 
article in Pandora's box that we shall take with us. Although a little more indisposed than I lately was, I am still 
much less unwell than I was at this time last year ; so that 
at present there is some prospect of my living to see further 
proofs of the perfectibility of human nature by modern 
philosophers, and of the increased illumination of this age 
of reason. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely,
