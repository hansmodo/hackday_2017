DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have long since wrote your Excellency, 
was there any thing in this quarter worth engaging 
your attention. I found, upon my journey home, That there was not the least probability of the enemy's 
attempting to rescue <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> and army. I therefore went to New Hampshire, where I tarried 
about twelve days. Upon my arrival there, I found 
no troops worth mentioning, and, by the inclosed re 
turn, your Excellency will see we are little better 
now. Connecticut has not sent us a man; Massachusetts, but fifty ; New Hampshire, owing to my pushing the matter, have theirs principally on the roads. 
</p><p>
The three last-mentioned regiments will leave me 
to-morrow; their time expires this night. When your Excellency has viewed this return, you will be surprised at the indolence of the enemy. They are 
three thousand six hundred strong, of British and 
Hessians, besides a small regiment of Greencoats, 
made up of deserters and refugees from us. This 
regiment consists of one hundred and twenty-seven, 
and is commanded by one Whitmore. They have 
drafted none from Rhode Island, this year, except 
fifty-four to join the light infantry of their Grand 
Army. Those sailed with Lord Howe. The enemy 
are busy in fortifying the Island, and are much afraid 
that we are about to attack them. I wish the deception may continue. Captain Whipple, in the <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> frigate, passed their shipping, with a strong gale of wind, the night of the 30th ultimo, under a 
severe fire, which he warmly returned, and got safe 
to sea. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new in this quarter, save that 
General Pigot politely requested nie to disperse his 
handbills among the people, which I refused, and delivered them over to the Assembly.* I since hear, 
that while I was viewing the sea-coast below the 
enemy, the populace rose and burnt them under the gallows. When any thing worth your Excellency's 
notice occurs, I shall give you the earliest intelligence. Interim, I have the honor to be, dear General, with the highest sentiments of gratitude and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
