</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wish to make a suggestion to you &amp; as in all cases 
the plainest course is the best, I proceed at once to my purpose. How it may accord with your own views I do not know 
but your conduct in <a href='/results.php?year=1834'>1834</a> has given me a very strong feel 
ing towards yourself &amp; your administration, and it is as the friend of both that I speak. 
</p><p>
The subject most canvassed at present is the retirement 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> a question of much importance to the 
country &amp; of great interest to yourself. Looking at it in 
both aspects, I have reached these conclusions 
</p><p>
1st as regard's the country 
</p><p>
I take it for granted that there is no fitter man for the place. 
</p><p>
This is settled by acclamation 
</p><p>
His successor must be his inferior 
</p><p>
Now his value lies in being precisely where he is. If he went to England he would be only a single minister now 
he is the instructor of all your ministers. Even in England the strength of his name would be greater as Secretary of 
State giving your instructions to the resident minister in England, than if he were there in person while to all other 
foreign governments that strength would be lost. 
</p><p>
Then 
</p><p>
2. as regards himself, 
</p><p>
You could not find a successor who would be so valuable 
&amp; faithful an assistant to you. 
</p><p>
There is no man sufficiently] prominent to justify his selection who would not be liable to more personal and political 
objections, than he has. Yet he has now but shown them. He 
has run that gauntlet He is seasoned and is acknowledged on all hands to do honor to your choice. Besides 
and this is the great matter for you personally he is the 
Secretary of State and nothing more. He has no political 
party, no body of political adherents. All these he has left for 
you. He has therefore no political aspirations. His strong 
hold on the country is that he can do the duties of the 
Department better than any one else and he will do it. 
He must work cordially with you without any cross purposes or intrigues having no political objects of his own. I 
remember well how my old friend <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a> was annoyed 
by having in his Cabinet three aspirants * for the Presidency. 
</p><p>
I would therefore not let him go from the Department of 
State whether he wishes it or not. 
</p><p>
Yet after all, these may be the thoughts of a retired person who is entirely wrong: for I do not sufficiently under 
stand the personal footing upon which you are &amp; which in truth, must decide the question. But if there be no private 
reasons for your separation, all the public considerations are against it. 
</p><p>
Allow me to request that you will not answer this note. 
It is a subject easy for one to write about not easy for you 
</p><p>
and my purpose is merely to convey the very sincere sentiment of a friend without troubling you with an increase of correspondence.
</p><p>
MEMORANDUM 2 OF BIDDLE TO DANIEL WEBSTER 
</p><p>
<a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a> 	<a rel='day origin' value='5'>5</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1843' rel="origin">1843</a> 
You are going to resign that you think inevitable 
</p><p>
well 
</p><p>
But the matter of resignation is less important than the manner. 
</p><p>
In parting with the President the programme will of course 
be perfectly amiable. Nothing will be visible on either side 
but reciprocal good will and you are hereafter to be the 
object of a friendship much cemented by separation. That 
settled, the next question is what do you retire to? and by 
what route? 
</p><p>
You retire of course to absolute private life. Any thing 
else will be a fall obvious and incurable. 
</p><p>
Then by what route do you retire ? 
</p><p>
If you have any political engagement with any one of the 
candidates, I have no more to say you must of course 
abide his fortunes. 
</p><p>
But if you are entirely uncommitted the three roads of retreat are open the route of <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> the route of the Loco Focos, the route of the Whigs. 
</p><p>
Now I take the route of <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> to be entirely impossible. The moment you leave him, you cease all political sympathy with his administration. 
</p><p>
The route of the Locofocos is equally impracticable. They will never leave their own leaders they will never move 
cordially under the banner of him against whom they have all their lives been fighting. 
</p><p>
There remains only the route of the Whigs. 
</p><p>
Now I have studied that part of the map with less judgment of course but with more impartiality perhaps than you 
have done because your own sensitiveness has made you more alive to the conduct of that party. 
</p><p>
They have had jealousies and heart burnings with regard 
to you they have treated you unkindly &amp; unjustly. Coldness there has been shyness, alienation, soreness at the 
injury done to them by your ceasing to act with them. But 
in my judgment there is no bitterness no wound not easily 
healed and the prevailing sentiment is rather regret &amp; sorrow 
than hostility. 
</p><p>
Believing therefore that you must fix yourself somewhere, 
that seems to be the best place. 
</p><p>
And I have imagined this course 
</p><p>
One of these days and soon before your motives are 
misinterpreted go to some public meeting not apparently made for the purpose, and say 
</p><p>
Six months ago I told you in Fanueil Hall that I was a 
Whig unchangeably. I repeat it now you separated from 
me, not I from you because I staid in power. But I did not 
so, because I thought I could do good. I think I did do good in making the English Treaty * and you agreed that I was right. 
</p><p>
Well, I thought by staying a little longer I could do more 
good. 
</p><p>
I told you so, and tried. 
</p><p>
But I find that I cannot do the good I proposed and therefore I would not remain in place a moment longer than I could serve the country. 
</p><p>
And so I have come back to you. 
</p><p>
I ask nothing I want nothing I take my stand in the ranks of the party willing to work with you, to support our measures, and our men. 
</p><p>
Such a step will be decisive it would be hailed with a shout throughout the country. 
</p><p>
It would make a brilliant retreat it would extricate you from your present awkward position and make your future 
path public &amp; private as smooth as you could desire. 
</p><p>
Think of this 
</p><p>
I offer it because I wish you to know my views before I know yours. 
</p><p>
If you have decided or shall decide otherwise I will bring myself to think it best, but now : 
</p><p>
this line of retreat both in a military &amp; civil aspect is the best in my judgment. 
</p><p>
You would think so too, if you studied the retreats of Lord Wellington in Spain. 
</p><p>
If possible, I would say nothing or what is equivalent to nothing at parting. 
</p><p>
The fear is that you may seem to approve too much of the past which is much to be avoided.
