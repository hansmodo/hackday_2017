Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I transmit herewith a duplicate of what I had the honor to 
write on the twenty-first of last month. Since that period, this 
government, perceiving that they had been wholly deceived 
respecting the British nation, have made advances towards 
conciliation. At least, so I am informed ; and also, that these 
advances are by a declaration that, however general the terms 
of their decree, they had no idea of exciting revolt, except in 
the dominions of the powers leagued against them. That as 
these powers had entered into France with design to change 
the established government, they are justified in turning against 
them the weapons of revolt, which they had intended to use. 
</p><p>
If this should ever become an object of diplomatic controversy, it will perhaps be objected, that until the asserted meaning of a general decree be declared by some other decree, 
the words must be taken in their plain and natural import. 
Should such new decree be passed, which by the bye would 
take from France a very powerful engine, the case of Savoy 
will be quoted, where, whatever may have been the supposed 
intentions, no facts existed to support the conduct which has 
been pursued, in such manner as to show a consistency with 
the limited interpretation put upon the decree. Lastly, as to 
the Austrian Netherlands, it will, I presume, be alleged, that 
not only the aggression was on the part of France, but that it 
was avowedly made with a view to excite revolt in that country. 
</p><p>
But I do not believe we shall have any such war of words, 
for I am convinced that France must, to avoid a war, do some 
thing more than make professions and explanations. I say 
nothing about the navigation of the Scheldt, and the projected 
invasion of Holland. I shall not, either, make any remarks on 
the unanimity in the British Parliament, which your; good 
sense and knowledge of that people had certainly anticipated. 
</p><p>
Accept, I pray you, Sir, the compliments of the season, and 
believe me, &ic.

P. S. The French armies are at length permitted to go 
into winter quarters ; that under Dumouriez amounted by the 
last returns to thirty-five thousand effectives, after the junction 
of Valence and Miranda.
