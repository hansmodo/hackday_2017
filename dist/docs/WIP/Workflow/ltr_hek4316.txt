My dear Sir,
</p><p> 
I cannot refrain from trespassing on your time, by expressing to you the perfect satisfaction, which the 
people of New England possess, by the operations of the General Government. The unanimity of the Legislature of this State was such, as to overbear all 
dispositions of a disorganizing nature. Had the Legislature conceived it proper, or Constitutional, they 
would have expressed their approbation in the highest degree. But they conceived this would be a two-edged sword. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, the Governor, may console himself with his good intentions, but he has no 
credit for them in the opinion of the wise and enlightened part of his countrymen. 
</p><p>
The whole country, from Maryland to New Hampshire inclusively, may be considered as a phalanx of good order and attachment to the administration of 
the General Government. A conviction of the existence of this disposition, and the most cordial affection to you, must afford you sensations of satisfaction 
which are inexpressible, especially after the gloomy threatenings of anarchy, which prevailed but in too many places the last summer. May this satisfaction never be clouded for a moment ! 
</p><p>
I am, with perfect attachment, &c., 
</p><p>
