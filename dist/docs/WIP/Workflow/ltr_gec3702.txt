Reflecting, with a most sincere satisfaction, on the 
marks of confidence which you have so repeatedly bestowed upon the Government of this State, we esteem 
it incumbent on us to afford your Excellency the perusal of a letter which we have addressed to Congress, a copy whereof we have the honor to inclose. 
Minute as we have been in a detail of our distresses, they fall far short of those we at this instant 
actually experience. Since we despatched the letter to 
Congress, petitions have been presented to us from 
every quarter of the frontiers, claiming protection, and 
entreating us, if we cannot afford it, in some degree, 
immediately, and during the campaign more effectually, to advise them of it, that they may take the 
advantage of the snow to remove their families and 
effects to the interior part of the State. Whilst these 
applications were under consideration, in order to devise the means of relief for those unhappy people, the 
enemy have commenced their barbarities, and butchered some of the inhabitants in Tryon county, numbers of whom, impelled by apprehensions too well 
founded, are already moving, and the remainder preparing to follow. In the dilemma to which this calamity has reduced us, we wish, in order to prevent 
a total depopulation of the best part of our remaining territory, to have it in our power to assure the 
inhabitants that the two regiments of our State 
line will be destined for the frontier service ; and we 
therefore take the liberty to request your Excellency 
to enable us to give these assurances, and to be informed from you whether this, or any other equal 
force, will remain for the protection of the northern 
and western frontiers. As nothing but the fullest 
conviction that such severe calamities will follow from 
withdrawing these troops, as will be replete with 
ruin to the common cause, could have induced us to 
this request, we trust in your Excellency's candor 
for a favorable construction of our intentions, as any interference in your command is the farthest from 
our wish. 
</p><p>
A want of ability to raise a competent body of 
troops for the defence of the frontiers, and a conviction of the necessity of at least doubling their number, induce us to entreat your Excellency to afford 
us whatever further assistance you may have in your 
power. Were it necessary to urge any motives to a 
gentleman who so eminently turns his attention to 
the commonweal of the Confederacy, we might state 
many to evince the importance of perfectly securing 
the country in question. We are convinced it is not; 
relying, in the fullest confidence, that all will be 
done for us that with propriety can be expected. 
</p><p>
The want of some artillerists and field-artillery, 
when the enemy penetrated into the country in the 
last campaign, was an evident disadvantage. We 
could, therefore, wish for such a portion of them 
as your Excellency may judge adequate to this service. The frequent calls on the militia, in the course 
of the last campaign, have exhausted all our stock of 
ammunition ; and, as we have not the means of obtaining any, except from the public magazines, permit us to entreat your Excellency to direct a quantity to be expedited to this place for the use of the 
troops (the militia), who may be called into the field. 
</p><p>
The Commanding Officer here will, doubtless, inform 
your Excellency that the troops in this department 
are destitute of provisions of the meat kind ; that, 
on the 6th instant, there was beef at Fort Schuyler 
only for fourteen days, and that the troops in this 
city and Schenectady are billeted upon the inhabitants, for want of that article of provision. As a 
present relief, we have advanced all the money in 
our treasury, amounting to about twelve hundred dollars of the new emission, to our agent to purchase 
beef. From this, however, we expect little success, 
as there are no beef cattle within the State ; and, 
should the agent succeed in making purchases to 
the amount of the cash, it will produce, at most, only 
a temporary supply. We therefore take the liberty 
to suggest to your Excellency the necessity of an 
order from you in favor of the Deputy Commissary 
of Issues, in This department, upon the magazine at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, in Massachusetts, or any of the Purchasing 
Officers in the other States bordering upon this, for 
a supply of beef for the use of the troops in this 
department ; which, if granted, the bearer will convey 
to the Deputy Commissary of Issues, who is now in 
this place. 
</p><p>
By order, and in behalf of the Legislature, I have 
the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and 
esteem, yours, &c.
