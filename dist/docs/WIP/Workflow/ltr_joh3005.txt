SIR, 
</p><p>
In my former letter, I mentioned the disagreeable 
news received from Canada. The Congress have taken 
that matter into consideration; and, having examined 
Mr. Antill, and duly deliberated on the situation of 
our affairs in that quarter, they have come to sundry 
resolutions, which I have the honor to inclose. 
</p><p>
I would just observe, that, by Mr. Antill's examination, it appears our loss is greater than what is set 
forth in the despatches he brought, a copy of which was transmitted to you. Almost the whole of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s gallant detachment are taken prisoners, 
having, after four hours resistance, been obliged to surrender at discretion. However, we have the satis faction to hear the prisoners are treated with humanity. 
</p><p>
The Congress are anxious, as Avell from motives of 
policy as of justice and humanity, to repair our 
losses in that quarter, and, if possible, to gain possession of Quebec, and drive our enemies out of that 
country before they can be reinforced in the spring. 
An active, able General is wanted to take the command there, arid if such an one can be spared from 
the service at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, it is their desire you should 
send him. 
</p><p>
The battalion from Pennsylvania, and that from 
New Jersey, will set forward the beginning of next 
week. 
</p><p>
As it is of great importance, as well for the security and relief of our friends as for confirming the 
wavering, that speedy succours should arrive, I am 
directed to request you to detach, from the camp at 
<a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, one battalion, if the service there will 
permit you to spare one, with orders to march, with 
the greatest expedition possible, to Canada. If this 
cannot be complied with, you will use your utmost 
endeavours in stimulating the Governor of Connecticut and the Convention of New Hampshire, to whom 
I write by this opportunity, to forward, with the utmost despatch, the very first companies that can be 
raised in those Colonies. You can easily conceive 
what effect the arrival of even one company will 
have on the minds of our friends, especially when 
they shall be satisfied it will soon be followed by 
more.

The Colony of South Carolina has been so fortunate as to oblige Lord William Campbell, with the 
vessels of war, to quit their harbour. Being earnestly 
desirous of providing for their defence, they have resolved to fit out some armed vessels, but not having 
seamen among themselves, they have despatched Captain Cochran to the northward, to enlist a number of 
seamen for the service of that Colony. Lest the 
offers he was empowered to make might prejudice 
the service, the Congress have chalked out a plan 
for him to go by, as you will see in the inclosed 
extracts, and I am directed to desire you will please 
to forward this service. 
</p><p>
Yesterday Dr. J. Smith, who made his escape from 
Frederick, was brought to this town. He was taken 
at the Little Meadows, on his way to Detroit, and 
had with him letters from Connolly to the commanding  officer there. 
</p><p>
I hinted to you, in my former letter, that the congress were taking measures for the defence of the 
Middle and Southern Colonies. For this purpose. over and above those destined for Canada, they have 
ordered four battalions to be raised in the Colony of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, two in New Jersey, four in Pennsylvania, 
one in the Counties on Delaware, six in Virginia, 
three in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, and 
one in Georgia, each to consist of seven hundred and 
twenty-eight men, including officers, making in the 
whole, with those for Canada, thirty-four battalions. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
