SIR: 
</p><p>
I received of Captain Falconer your kind letter of Nov. 
1 8, with a very welcome present of another Dozen of your 
wine. The former has been found excellent by many good 
judges, my Wine Merchant in particular was very desirous 
of knowing what quantity of it might be had and at what 
price, in which I could give him no satisfaction. I only 
said that as the grapes being uncultivated, were not very 
juicy, I apprehended so many of them must be required, and 
so much labour in gathering, and pressing them to produce 
a little wine, that the price could not be very low. I shall 
apply this parcel as I did the last towards winning the hearts 
of the Friends of our Country, and wellwishers to the Change 
of its Government The Partizans of the present, may as 
you say flatter themselves that such Change will not take 
place, till the Proprietor's death, but I imagine he hardly 
thinks so himself. Anxiety and uneasiness are painted on his 
brow and the woman who would like to see how he would 
look when dead, need only look at him while living In 
that respect at least he appears to be a good Christian as one 
that dieth daily With great regard, and many thanks for 
your kindness to me, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your much obliged Friend and humble Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
