My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We are doing some little matters about the Sub 
Treasury bill, which, from all I can understand, will not pass. 
At the same time I wish to omit nothing to prevent its passage and therefore I will thank you to send me by return 
of mail if convenient, a list marked with all those who you are 
</p><p>
^sure will vote against it, &amp; let me know also how many votes 
you want in addition. Perhaps we may prove to some of our 
Penn a members, that their course is injurious to the state &amp; 
to themselves. 
</p>
