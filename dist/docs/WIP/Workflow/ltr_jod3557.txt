MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS moment, returning from Mr. Bridgen's, where 
I had been to deliver him a letter to you, written 
this morning, I found your very acceptable favor 
of the 23d. I am very glad you are so well situated, so much pleased with your journey and present accommodations. Don t be solicitous about me. 
I shall do very well. If I am cold in the night, and 
an additional quantity of bed clothes will not answer 
the purpose of warming me, I will take a virgin to 
bed with me. Ay ! a virgin. 
</p><p>
What ? Oh ! Awful ! what do I read ? 
</p><p>
Don t be surprised. Do you know what a virgin 
is ? Mr. Bridgen brought me acquainted with it this 
morning. It is a stone bottle, such as you buy with 
spruce beer and spa water, filled with boiling water, 
covered over or wrapped up in flannel, and laid at a 
man's feet in bed. An old man, you see, may com 
fort himself with such a virgin as much as David did 
with Abishag, and not give the least jealousy even to 
his wife, the smallest grief to his children, or any 
scandal to the world. Tell Mr. Bridgen, when you 
see him, that I am indebted to him for this important 
piece of knowledge, which I would not sell for a 
great deal of money. 
</p><p>
Tell Colonel Smith I am half disposed to be almost 
miffed with him, for going off without giving me his 
letter about the Indians ; and what completes the mis 
chief is, that he has all the books locked up in his 
room. Pray him to write me if it is possible to get 
at the letter or the books ; both are what I want. My 
love to Abby Smith and her knight, and to all the 
party. Mr. Shippen is with you ere now. He was so good as to pick a bone with me once, and Mr. Cutting is very good. We now talk politics all alone, 
and are much cooler and more rational than when we 
</p><p>
dispute in company. 
</p><p>
Yours forever, 
</p><p>
