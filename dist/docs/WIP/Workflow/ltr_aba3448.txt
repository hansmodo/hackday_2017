MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I arrived here on Sunday last, and without meeting 
with any accident worth noticing, except losing ourselves when we left <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, and going eight or 
nine miles on the Frederick road, by which means 
we were obliged to go the other eight through 
woods, where we wandered two hours without finding a guide, or the path. Fortunately, a straggling 
black came up with us, and we engaged him as a 
guide, to extricate us out of our difficulty ; but woods 
are all you see, from <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> until you reach the 
city, which is only so in name. Here and there is a 
small cot, without a glass window, interspersed 
amongst the forests, through which you travel miles 
without seeing any human being. In the city there 
are buildings enough, if they were compact and 
finished, to accommodate Congress and those attached to it ; but as they are, and scattered as they are, 
I see no great comfort for them. The river, which 
runs up to <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>, is in full view of my window, 
and I see the vessels as they pass and repass. The 
house is upon a grand and superb scale, requiring 
about thirty servants to attend and keep the apartments in proper order, and perform the ordinary 
business of the house and stables ; an establishment 
very well proportioned to the President's salary. The 
lighting the apartments, from the kitchen to parlours 
and chambers, is a tax indeed ; and the fires we are 
obliged to keep to secure us from daily agues is 
another very cheering comfort. To assist us in this 
great castle, and render less attendance necessary, 
bells are wholly wanting, not one single one being 
hung through the whole house, and promises are all 
you can obtain. This is so great an inconvenience, 
that I know not what to do, or how to do. The ladies from <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> and in the city have many of 
them visited me. Yesterday I returned fifteen visits, but such a place as <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> appears, 
why, our Milton is beautiful. But no comparisons ; 
if they will put me up some bells, and let me have 
wood enough to keep fires, I design to be pleased. I could content myself almost anywhere three 
months ; but, surrounded with forests, can you believe that wood is not to be had, because people 
cannot be found to cut and cart it ! Briesler entered into a contract with a man to supply him with 
wood. A small part, a few cords only, has he 
been able to get. Most of that was expended to 
dry the walls of the house before we came in, and 
yesterday the man told him it was impossible for 
him to procure it to be cut and carted. He has 
had recourse to coals ; but we cannot get grates 
made and set. We have, indeed, come into a new 
country. 
</p><p>
You must keep all this to yourself, and, when 
asked how I like it, say that I write you the situation 
is beautiful, which is true. The house is made habitable, but there is not a single apartment finished, 
and all withinside, except the plastering, has been 
done since Briesler came. We have not the least 
fence, yard, or other convenience, without, and the 
great unfinished audience-room I make a dryingroom of, to hang up the clothes in. The principal 
stairs are not up, and will not be this winter. Six 
chambers are made comfortable ; two are occupied 
by the President and Mr. Shaw ; two lower rooms, one for a common parlour, and one for a levee-room. 
Up stairs there is the oval room, which is designed 
for the drawingroom, and has the crimson furniture 
in it. It is a very handsome room now ; but, when 
completed, it will be beautiful. If the twelve years, 
in which this place has been considered as the future 
seat of government, had been improved, as they 
would have been if in New England, very many 
of the present inconveniences would have been removed. It is a beautiful spot, capable of every improvement, and, the more I view it, the more I am 
delighted with it. 
</p><p>
Since I sat down to write, I have been called 
down to a servant from <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, with a billet 
from Major Custis, and a haunch of venison, and a 
kind, congratulatory letter from Mrs. Lewis, upon 
my arrival in the city, with Mrs. Washington's love, 
inviting me to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, where, health permitting, I will go, before I leave this place. 
</p><p>
The Senate is much behind-hand. No Congress 
</p><p>
has yet been made. 'Tis said is on his 
</p><p>
way, but travels with so many delicacies in his rear, 
that he cannot get on fast, lest some of them should 
suffer. 
</p><p>
Thomas comes in and says a House is made ; so 
to-morrow, though Saturday, the President will meet 
them. Adieu, my dear. Give my love to your 
brother, and tell him he is ever present upon my 
mind. 
</p><p>
Affectionately your mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
