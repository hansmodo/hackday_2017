DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
You request in your letter that I would candidly give my opinion of your conduct, while you acted under me in a military capacity; what I 
think of your ability in discharging the duties of your department; and, also, that I would recollect, if possible, all that passed between us 
relative to the acceptance and resignation of your appointment to it. 
</p><p>
When I was ordered to your State, several respectable characters requested to attend me as Brigade-Major, but, as I had made it a rule 
to appoint to office, whenever in my power, the inhabitants of that particular State where I was immediately acting, in preference to all others, I declined accepting transfers; and never, as I recollect, deviated from 
this rule, but in the instance of Major Connor, whom I found established in that rank, and who, after your resignation, and Gen. Armstrong's departure, I therefore adopted. Gen. Lee, when he appointed 
me to command in your State, desired me to nominate some person 
as my Major of Brigade; at that time, you were personally unacquainted with me, but I had observed you very active in, and attentive to, duty, always attending parades, relief of guards, and, in 
short, so assiduous and useful, that I was induced, without either your request or the least recommendation of you, to offer you the place 
of Brigade-Major. You told me that, provided Colonel Pinckney had no objection, you would, during the existence of actual service, 
cheerfully accept it, because you might, by that means, have an opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of discipline, which would render you 
useful to your country as a militia officer; but that you did not desire 
to derive either emolument or reward from the appointment. You, accordingly, served me in South Carolina and Georgia, I believe, about 
five months; in the first of these you not only acted as Brigade Major, but did a great deal of duty in the militia ; in the latter, you served 
Gen. Lee, in the absence of Col. Bullet, in the capacity of Adjutant General, without in the least neglecting the duty of your particular appointment; and it is but justice to you to say, that I found you active 
and capable in a post both difficult and fatiguing, and that you acquitted yourself to my entire satisfaction. The General often spoke of you in 
terms of approbation, and strongly recommended to me to keep you in 
the army if possible. When he returned to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and all actual 
service had ceased, you requested leave to resign, and, upon my earnestly urging you to continue with me, you reminded me of the conditions 
upon which you had been appointed repeating, that as your principal view, in entering the regular service, was to gain a knowledge of discipline that would render you serviceable as a militia officer, in which 
capacity you conceited you could be most useful to your country, you were desirous of returning to your duty in the corps to which you 
belonged, where you would, with pleasure, exert yourself to the utmost of your ability. 
</p><p>
These, sir, are aH the circumstances I can just now recollect, and I have been thus particular because you desired it. The manner of my expression you will excuse, as I write in a hurry. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
