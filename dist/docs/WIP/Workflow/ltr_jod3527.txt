THE weather continuing fine, I went to Saint Denis, 
a little village about eight miles from this place, 
where are the tombs of all the kings and queens. 
The statues of all lie in state in marble. The church 
is called the royal Church of Saint Denis, is magnificent, and there is an apartment in a chamber, where 
the crowns and many other curiosities are preserved. 
It is curious to see such a collection of gold, ivory 
and precious stones ; as there is every species, I sup 
pose, that is mentioned in the Revelation. The diamonds and rubbies glitter. But I confess I have so 
much of the savage sachem in me, that these things 
make no great impression upon me. There are several little crucifixes here, which the ecclesiastic, who 
showed them, told us, were made of bits of the true 
cross. This may be, for any thing that I know.

In my return, I took a circuit round by Montmartre, 
and dined at home with the Dr., who has a fit of the 
gout, but is getting better.

The situation in which my masters have left me 
puzzles me very much. They have said nothing to 
me. But one set of gentlemen write that I am to go 
to Spain, another to Holland, a third to Vienna ; but, 
upon the whole, I believe they don t intend to send 
me to either, but leave me to stay here in a ridiculous 
situation, or return home if I can get there. I shall 
return unless I should receive, before the time arrives 
for the vessel to sail, orders which I can execute with 
honor, and with a prospect of rendering some service 
to the public. But of these two last points, I will 
judge for myself.
