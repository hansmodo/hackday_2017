My D'r Sir, 
</p><p>
The contents of this letter you will comprehend, when you connect with it a late conversation held by yourself with 
a mutual acquaintance of ours, and to whom an unexpected 
opportunity has been offer d of gaining the following information, on which you may rely as of the highest, &amp; most direct authority. 
</p><p>
You need not be informed of the hostility of the Administration to the Institution over which you preside, but the 
following items must prove interesting. At this moment the opinion of the different members as to the immediate 
withdrawal of the Government Deposites is asked, and their individual opinion stands thus. In the first place the 
President considers that he has conquered all of his difficulties but that of the Bank, &amp; this he is determined to 
accomplish "coute qui coute." Were it left to Kendall &amp; himself they would withdraw the Deposites immediately, 
but believing as they do, that the Bank has 40 or 50 millions discount in the Western Country, which it will be compelled to curtail, whether or no, they prefer the odium to rest 
on its Head, instead of that of the Government. Mr. McLane 
considers that the Government would be prostrated by their 
taking this step, and therefore is adverse to the withdrawal 
at present. The Post Master Gen'l , objects to the step at this 
moment also, but considers the convenience of making his 
Deposits in State Banks so important, that he contemplates 
asking permission (which he thinks will not be refused him) 
of making his separate deposits in them, more especially 
as you will not permit him to overdraw, without a confidential letter from him to that effect. Taney is for immediate withdrawal. And the influence of such men as Com 6 Stewart, 
Whitney, &amp;c, is exerted to effect this object, which will produce the natural consequence of lowering the market value 
of the Stock. The present disposition of the influential party 
is to withdraw the deposits in October next. But the wily 
Magician is for throwing the responsibility on Congress, believing that they will have a sufficient majority to Carry 
their measure. His hostility to the Bank is implacable; and 
the various offers made to them by different State Banks tally's much better with their ulterior views than the security offered by the present mode of Deposit. In a few words, 
if it be not determined on to withdraw the Deposits in 
October, the firm belief is, that the President, instead of 
recommending this measure in his next annual Message, will 
simply state in it some definite period when he is determined 
they shall be withdrawn.

I give you the above information at the request of Mr. Oliver, and should any thing further be communicated which 
we may deem important, you shall be made acquainted with it. 
</p><p>
I need not point out the source of this information but will merely add, that you may rely on the its correctness. 
</p><p>
That it may prove of service to you is the sincere wish of
