Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to you yesterday. Colonel Touzard, who takes charge of my letters, having been 
detained a day longer, it furnishes the opportunity of sending 
this day's gazettes, and such intelligence as is now arrived. 
</p><p>
It appears that the army of Dumouriez is attached to him, 
and will go all the lengths which he desires. What is worse, 
te that the militia also adhere, so that he has all chances now 
in his favor, and probably as soon as the magazines are duly 
replenished he will advance, for under such circumstances we 
are not to expect much resistance from the frontier towns. 
The affair of Custine has been very serious. 
</p><p>
The garrison of Mayence is shut up in that town, and if it 
capitulates the enemy will derive from the magazines lodged in 
it the means needful for ulterior operations. Hence I conclude, 
that such terms will be offered as will be accepted. Custine's 
left flank is entirely open, and in all human probability the 
several passes in the Vosges mountains will be occupied by 
the column of Hessians, and in that case his retreat to France 
becomes impossible, and he must make the best of it in 
Alsace. Every hour is now big with important events, and 
how matters will go in this city, the Lord knows. I am, &c.
