Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It gave me pleasure to receive from Dr. Edwards your 
letter of the 7th ult., and to converse with him on the subjects alluded to in it. My letters to you and others on 
your side of the water have, since my return, been few, 
and not very interesting. The risks to which letters are 
exposed in times like these, rendered me more reserved 
than I should otherwise have been. 
</p><p>
You have doubtless by this time heard that Mr. Benson 
has been chosen the third commissioner for ascertaining 
the river St. Croix, intended by the treaty of peace. He 
is now on that business ; a better appointment could not 
have been made. Whatever the decision may be, both 
parties will, I am persuaded, have reason to be satisfied 
with it. 
</p><p>
You are now placed, as you well observe, in a situation 
delicate and important. Your reflections on it are just and 
proper. The interest I take in what concerns you induces 
me to enlarge a little upon them. 
</p><p>
To settle and agree on the principles which ought to 
govern in the capture cases, as well as the application of 
them to those cases, will require great care, consideration, 
and impartiality. The majority of the commissioners 
being Americans, the honour of our country will be increased or diminished by their decisions. I flatter myself 
they will be such as to merit the approbation of distant and 
disinterested generations in both countries. 
</p><p>
It is natural that the claimants should, and they doubtless 
-will be, sanguine in their expectations. Some of them 
may be difficult to satisfy, and perhaps become clamorous. 
Firmness, therefore, as well as integrity and caution, will 
be requisite to explore and persevere in the path of justice. 
They who, in following her footsteps, tread upon popular 
prejudices, or crush the schemes of individuals, must expect clamours and resentment. The best way to prevent 
being perplexed by considerations of that kind is to dismiss 
them all, and never to permit the mind to dwell upon them 
for a moment. I suspect it is with men in these cases, as it 
is said to be with women in certain others, they who hesitate 
are in danger of being lost. 
</p><p>
Although a judge may possess the best talents, and the 
purest intentions, yet let him keep a jealous eye over his 
sensibilities and attachments, lest they imperceptibly give 
to error too near a resemblance to truth. Nay, let him 
even watch over that jealousy, for the apprehension of 
being thought partial to one side, has a tendency to incline 
a delicate mind towards the other. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Very sincerely your friend, 
</p><p>
