Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my letter of the 28th ultimo, I informed you of 
the succours you might expect, if necessary. The six companies of Van Schaick's regiment have since sailed. 
Hazen's will follow to-morrow. I have now to communicate my sentiments in general, respecting the disposition and application of this force. 
</p><p>
It is clearly my opinion, that the reinforcements lately 
ordered to the northward should be kept together as 
much as circumstances will admit, or at least so near 
as to be speedily assembled upon an emergency ; as 
it is not certain or probable, that they will be continued permanently in that quarter, and as they are 
designed while there to strike the enemy, should they 
be so presumptuous as to attempt to penetrate into 
the country. It also appears to me, that the force on 
the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers ought not to be so 
widely scattered as formerly, but stationed in as compact a manner as may be, except such light parties 
as occasion may require to be kept out. By distributing the troops, with a view of protecting every inch 
of ground, the efficient force is dissipated and lost, 
and the several posts are so weakened as to invite 
the enemy to enterprise. I wish you therefore to concentrate your strength as much as possible at the points 
you may judge most expedient, to form a plan of defence for the frontier, and to transmit to me the result of your determination. I am, dear Sir, &c.t 
</p>
