MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE only time to enclose you something. Dr. Priestley breakfasted with me. I asked him whether 
it was his opinion that the French would ultimately establish a republican government. He said it was, 
and his opinion was founded upon the prophecy. 
France appeared to him to be one of the horns that 
were to fall off. He acknowledged, however, the 
uncertainty, and related a paragraph from a French 
writer who travelled in England immediately before 
the restoration of Charles the second. " That the 
people were much engaged in disputing about a form 
of government, but that all agreed there would never 
be any kings in England again." 
</p><p>
When statesmen found their judgments upon prophecies I can never confide in their opinions.
