DEAR SALLY, 
</p><p>
I received your agreable Letters of Oct. n. and Nov. 5. 
I met with Mr. Bache at Preston, where I staid two or three 
Days, being very kindly entertained by his Mother and Sisters, 
whom I lik'd much. He came to town with me, and is now 
going home to you. I have advis'd him to settle down to 
Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he will always be with you. 
I am of Opinion, that almost any Profession a Man has been 
educated in, is preferable to an Office held at Pleasure, as 
rendering him more independent, more a Freeman, and less 
subject to the Caprices of Superiors. And I think, that in 
keeping a Store, if it be where you dwell, you can be serviceable to him as your Mother was to me : For you are not 
deficient in Capacity, and I hope are not too proud. 
</p><p>
You might easily learn Accounts, and you can copy Letters, 
or write them very well upon Occasion. By Industry & 
Frugality you may get forward in the World, being both of 
you yet young. And then what we may leave you at our 
Death may be a pretty Addition, tho' of itself far from sufficient to maintain & bring up a Family. It is of the more 
Importance for you to think seriously of this, as you may 
have a Number of Children to educate. 'Till my Return you 
need be at no Expence for Rent, etc, as you are all welcome 
to continue with your Mother, and indeed it seems to be your 
Duty to attend her, as she grows infirm, and takes much 
Delight in your Company and the Child's. This Saving 
will be a Help in your Progress : And for your Encouragement I can assure you that there is scarce a Merchant of 
Opulence in your Town, whom I do not remember a young 
Beginner with as little to go on with, & no better Prospects 
than Mr. Bache. That his Voyage hither might not be quite 
fruitless, I have given him 2Oo Sterling; with which I wish 
you good Luck. 
</p><p>
I hope you will attend to what is recommended to you in 
this Letter, it proceeding from sincere Affection, after due 
Consideration, with the Knowledge I have of the World and 
my own Circumstances. I am much pleas' d with the Ace' 
I receive from all Hands of your dear little Boy. I hope he 
will be continu'd a Blessing to us all. Tho' I long to see my 
Family, I am glad you did not come over, as the Expence 
would have been very great, and I think I shall not continue 
here much longer. It is a Pleasure to me that the little 
Things I sent you prov'd agreable. I am ever, my dear 
Sally, your affectionate Father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
