MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Since the General wrote you, this morning, he has conversed with 
the person mentioned in his letter ; he is impressed with the idea of 
the enemy's intending to advance immediately; preparations are making to accomplish it as early as possible. The movement towards the <a href='/results.php?city=santee' rel='city'>Santee</a> was probably to draw the attention of part of our force to that 
quarter. You will join the army with the troops under your command as early as possible. Be pleased to communicate to Gen. Marion on the 
subject. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> wishes to hear from you this night. I am with sincerity yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jbu" rel="me">J. BURNET</a>, Aide-de-Camp,
