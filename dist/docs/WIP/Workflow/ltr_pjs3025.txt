DEAR, SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 24th instant, 
which I received half an hour ago, having just arrived 
from Moses Creek, where I keep my quarters. 
</p><p>
So far from the militia that are with me increasing , they are daily diminishing, and I am very confident that in ten days, if the enemy should not Disturb us, we shall not have five hundred left ; and although I have entreated this and the Eastern States 
to send up a reenforcement of them, yet I doubt much 
if any will come up, especially from the Eastern 
States, where the spirit of malevolence knows no 
bounds, and I am considered as a traitor. 
</p><p>
I believe your Excellency has spared me all the 
troops you prudently could, but we are still too weak 
in this quarter, especially as sickness decreases us 
with great rapidity. Our men living entirely upon 
fresh meat occasions much disease. Salt meat we 
have none of, nor is any to be got in this quarter. 
If it can be spared from any post below, I wish a 
quantity may be ordered up. 
</p><p>
I have informed you that, on the 26th, an advanced picket was attacked near Fort Edward. Last night 
a body of regular troops appeared at that place, how 
ever not in such force but that they suffered our 
men, about one hundred and fifty in number, to come 
off unmolested. I believe their main body will be 
down in a few days. We are preparing to receive 
them in the best manner we can. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to see <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a></a>. He may 
possibly be able to do something with the New T England militia. 
</p><p>
I do not think it would be prudent, at present, to 
send <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a></a> to Fort Schuyler. I will try to 
send another General Officer to that place. I am, dear 
Sir, with great regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
