DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From the last accounts from Great Britain, it appears absolutely necessary that there should be an 
augmentation of the American forces, in consequence 
of which I suppose there will be several promotions. 
As I have no desire of quitting the service, I hope 
the Congress will take no measure that will lay me 
under the disagreeable necessity of doing it. I have 
ever found myself exceeding happy under your Excellency's command. I wish my ability to deserve 
was equal to my inclination to merit. How far I 
have succeeded in my endeavours, I submit to your 
Excellency's better judgment. I hope I shall never 
be more fond of promotion than studious to merit it. 
Modesty will ever forbid me to apply to that House 
for any favors. I consider myself immediately under your Excellency's protection, and look up to you for 
justice. Every man feels himself wounded, where he 
finds himself neglected, and that in proportion as he 
is conscious of endeavouring to merit attention. I 
shall be satisfied with any measure that the Congress 
shall take, that has not a direct tendency to degrade 
me in the public estimation. A measure of that 
sort would sink me in my own esteem, and render 
me spiritless and uneasy in my situation, and consequently unfit for the service. 
</p><p>
I wish for nothing more than justice, either upon 
principle of merit or rank, and will at all times rest 
satisfied when your Excellency tells me I ought to 
be. I feel myself strongly attached to the cause, to 
the Continental Congress, and to your Excellency's 
person and I should consider it a great misfortune 
to be deprived of an opportunity of taking an active 
part in the support of the one, and the promotion of 
the other. 
</p><p>
But should any thing take place contrary to my 
wishes, which might furnish me with sufficient reason 
of quitting the service, yet I will not do it, until the 
danger and difficulties appear less than at present. 
Believe me to be, with the highest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
