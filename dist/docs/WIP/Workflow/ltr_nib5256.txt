Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The President has undertaken to say of the Bank 
that which is wholly without foundation &amp; to denounce the 
institution. The whole influence of his government, &amp; of the 
presses subservient to his government, is employed in endeavoring to break down the Bank. In this situation, the Bank can only find safety in such explanations of its proceedings as will satisfy the country that it has been justly 
assailed &amp; that its operations are highly beneficial. But how 
it is to make these explanations, except thro the press, the 
only channel of communication with the people ? And if it 
employs that channel, why should it ask of printers to insert its explanations gratuitously? If a grocer wishes to ap 
prize the public that he has a fresh supply of figs, the printer 
whom he employs for that purpose never thinks of giving his 
labor for nothing, but charges him for his trouble in inserting 
the advertisement. If the Bank in a like manner wishes a 
printer to insert information about its concerns, why should 
it not pay him for his trouble? The payment for the printing 
of documents thus disseminated is not only so proper but so 
just, that one is amused by the affected squemishness of the 
other printers who do not happen to be employed when they 
denounce the Bank for circulating documents which Congress itself has ordered to be disseminated by means of extra 
copies, and what is worse than all, paying the printers for their labor. . . .
