Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving yours of the 29th of March, and 
in consequence I send the enclosed formula of the certificates 
of registry, with which American vessels ought to be furnished. 
Our government grants these certificates only to those vessels, 
which belong exclusively to American citizens. They must 
also have been built in the United States, or at least have 
belonged since the sixteenth of May, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>, to American 
citizens. The law of the United States also exacts, that the 
captain be an American citizen, and that before the vessel is 
recorded, one of the owners shall make attestation under oath, 
of the truth of these facts. In fine, captains and owners are 
forbidden to give, sell, or lend these certificates, and in case 
they are made use of by any foreign vessel under the American flag, the offender shall incur the penalty of confiscation. 
</p><p>
Such, Sir, are the regulations made on the 1st of September, <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>; and I have not learned that since that time there 
have been others. I have read, it is true, in one of our gazettes, that in the course of the month of January, a new law 
on the subject had been presented to the President of the 
United States for his acceptance, but I am ignorant of its con 
tents, not having yet received a copy of it. I am persuaded 
however that it does not differ essentially (as to the subject 
in question) from that which I have just had the honor of presenting to you. I shall hasten to communicate it to you as soon 
as it arrives, for it is my inclination, as well as my duty, to 
prevent as much as possible foreigners, and especially the enemies of France, from enjoying the privileges of our neutrality. 
</p><p>
I am fully persuaded, Sir, of the friendly disposition of the 
French republic towards that of America, and I shall continue 
to render a faithful account of it, for I sincerely desire to 
strengthen more and more the bonds, which unite the two countries. Will you have the goodness to give me a copy of the decrees passed by the Convention, to which you did me the honor to refer ? Hitherto I have been unable, in my despatches, 
to speak of them except in general terms, as they have not 
been communicated to me in any other manner, than through 
the very uncertain channel of the gazettes. I have the honor 
to be, &c.
