My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received your letters of the 26th and 30th 
ultimo and 1st instant. I cannot learn that any troops 
have yet arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> from Virginia. A fleet 
of twenty sail came in last Saturday with troops, but 
they are said to be Hessian recruits from Europe. The 
<a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>e frigate has arrived at Newport from Count de Gitisse. He was to leave St. Domingo the 3d of this 
month, with a fleet of between twenty- five and twenty-nine sail of the line, and a considerable body of land 
forces. His destination is immediately for the Chesapeake ; so that he will either be there by the time this 
reaches you, or you may look for him every moment. 
Under these circumstances, whether the enemy remain 
in full force, or whether they have only a detachment 
left, you will immediately take such a position as will 
best enable you to prevent their sudden retreat through 
North Carolina, which I presume they will attempt 
the instant they perceive so formidable an armament. 
Should <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a>, with the troops destined for 
South Carolina, still remain in the neighbourhood of 
James River, and should the enemy have made no detachment to the southward, you will detain those troops 
until you hear from me again, and inform <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> of the cause of their delay. If Wayne should 
have marched, and should have gained any considerable distance, I would not have him halted. 
</p><p>
You shall hear further from me as soon as I have 
concerted plans and formed dispositions for sending a 
reinforcement from hence. In the mean time, I have 
only to recommend a continuation of that prudence 
and good conduct, which you have manifested through 
the whole of your campaign. You will be particularly 
careful to conceal the expected arrival of the Count; 
because, if the enemy are not apprized of it, they will 
stay on board their transports in the Bay, which will 
be the luckiest circumstance in the world. You will 
take measures for opening a communication with Count de Grasse the moment he arrives, and will concert 
measures with him for making the best use of your 
joint forces until you receive aid from this quarter. I 
would not wish you to call out a large body of militia upon this occasion, but rather keep those you have 
compact and ready for service. I am, &c. 
</p>
