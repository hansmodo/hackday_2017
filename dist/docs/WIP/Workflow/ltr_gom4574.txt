My Dear Doctor, 
</p><p>
I am pretty well convinced that I am not fit for a traveller  
and yet I thought otherwise when I left America. But what will 
you say to a man, who has passed through Rouen without 
looking at the great bell, and who has been above two months 
in Paris without ascending to the top of Notre Dame ; who 
has not been inside of any church whatever, except one which 
is building ; who has not been but three times at Versailles, 
and on neither of those times has seen the King or Queen, or 
had the wish to see them ; and who, if he should continue here 
twenty years, would continue in ignorance of the length of the 
Louvre, the breadth of the Pont Neuf, the depth of the Seine, 
and a thousand other lengths, breadths, and dimensions, which 
are of the last importance, as everybody knows ? 
</p><p>
Should you ask me what I have seen, I might reply in the 
words of Nat Hyde, of stammering memory, It is hard to say. 
A man in Paris lives in a sort of whirlwind, which turns him 
round so fast that he can see nothing. And as all men and 
things are in the same vertiginous condition, you can neither 
fix yourself nor your object for regular examination. Hence 
the people of this metropolis are under the necessity of pronouncing their definitive judgment from the first glance ; and 
being thus habituated to shoot flying, they have what the sports 
men call a quick sight. Ex pede Herculem. They know a 
wit by his snuff-box, a man of taste by his bow, and a states 
man by the cut of his coat. It is true, that, like other sports 
men, they sometimes miss ; but, then, like other sportsmen, 
too, they have a thousand excuses, besides the want of 
skill. The fault you know may be in the dog, or the bird, or 
the powder, or the flint, or even the gun, without mentioning 
the gunner. 
</p><p>
We are at present in a fine situation for what the bucks and 
bloods would term a frolic, or high fun. The ministers have 
disgusted this city by the manner of convoking them to elect 
their representatives for the States-General, and at the same time 
bread is getting dearer, so that when the people assemble on 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next, what with hunger and 
discontent, the least spark would set everything in a flame. 
The state physicians have, by way of antidote, brought between 
fifteen and twenty thousand regular troops within and about 
the city, so that at any rate the bons Bourgeois may not have 
all the fun to themselves. This measure will rather tend to produce than to prevent a riot. For some of the young nobility have 
brought themselves to an active faith in the natural equality of 
mankind, and spurn at everything which looks like restraint. 
There are some anecdotes of this sort, the most whimsical and 
ridiculous imaginable, but I have neither time nor inclination 
to communicate them.

I am, &c.
