Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the Sunday night after leaving <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, I arrived here, where, to my surprise, I found 
that a quorum of the Senate was not assembled, and but a small majority of Representatives. 
</p><p>
On this day we went to business ; and, to my very great satisfaction, I heard a unanimous vote of the 
electing States in favor of calling you to the honorable office of President of the United States. Before 
this period, I judged it might not be acceptable to speak my sentiments to you on this subject. But 
now, I hope I may be permitted to express my ardent hope, that your inclinations may correspond with 
the united wish of America, that you should preside over those councils which you have so greatly contributed to render independent. Indeed, I am sure 
that the public happiness, which I know you have so much at heart, will be very insecure without your acceptance. 
</p><p>
The two Houses feel the necessity of proceeding to the preparation of some important business, that 
it may be in all possible forwardness against your arrival; that of securing the impost on the spring 
arrivals, seems to be the most pressing. An express goes also to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> immediately, to inform him 
of his election to the office of Vice-President. I pray to "be remembered affectionately to your lady and 
the family at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. With every sentiment 
of respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rhl" rel="me">Richard Henry Lee</a>.
