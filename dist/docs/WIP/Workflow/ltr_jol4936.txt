I was obliged to write you a hurried letter by the 
hands of Gen'l Du Portail and had barely time to 
acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 15th . 
Yesterday I had the pleasure of receiving your kind 
letter of the 22 d with S. Carolina papers and letters 
from England. Among them was the enclosed for 
you, which I take to be from my wife. Her last date 
to me is the 1st November, at which time she and your 
granddaughter were well. I enclose you likewise the 
last letter from Mr. Manning, the others were all of 
old dates. As Gen'l Mclntosh is ordered with a 
detachment on the other side Schuylkil, to cover the 
passage of a large drove of cattle that have crossed 
the Delaware at Sherard's ferry, I take the liberty of 
detaining the N. papers till his return, which will be 
in a day or two, that he may not miss what will be so 
great a treat to him. He has mentioned to me several 
times of late, that he fancied you were retaliating his 
ancient delinquencies. 
</p><p>
I am grieved that you persevere in your resolution 
of retiring from Congress. Your reelection is a 
testimony of the good opinion of your countrymen, 
and I think it is needless to urge the necessity of 
increasing rather than diminishing the number of 
able and virtuous men in the grand council of the 
nation. 
</p><p>
The retiring of a single one at the present crisis 
is a dangerous example, and may fatally strengthen 
the hands of those who have not the cause of liberty 
and the interest of their country at heart. I have 
long anxiously desired to see you, but the unabating 
flow of business in the general's family restrained 
me from asking leave. Two of our gentlemen l are 
appointed commissioners to meet General Howe at 
German Town, for negociating the exchange of 
prisoners. Their absence will render the presence 
of the rest more than ever necessary; but if you 
will give me notice when it will be convenient for 
me to come, I will ask for a short furlough, that I 
may have the happiness of embracing you, and saying many things which are not so well expressed in 
writing. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> has commenced the functions of 
inspector general. Several officers whose character 
and abilities give them influence, and are pledges of 
success, are to be nominated as sub-inspectors ; intelligent active men are appointed to each brigade to 
serve as brigade inspectors. The baron has given 
some elementary lessons in writing, preparatory to 
ulterior instructions ; and we hope by this institution 
that the important end of establishing uniformity of 
discipline and manoeuvres throughout the army will be accomplished. 
</p><p>
This I communicate to yourself only, for I don t know whether the general communicates this plan by this courier for ratification. 
</p><p>
The baron discovers the greatest zeal, and an 
activity which is hardly to be expected at his 
years. The officers in general seem to entertain 
a high opinion of him, and he sets them an excellent 
example in descending to the functions of a drillsergeant. 
</p><p>
A French gentleman of the name of Ternaut with 
whom I was slightly acquainted at the cape Fraiois, 
is arrived in camp, and offers himself as one of the 
sub-inspectors. His talents qualify him in a superior 
degree for the office. He has travelled so much 
as to have worn off the characteristic manners of 
his nation, and he speaks our language uncommonly 
well. 
</p><p>
The baron is very desirous of having him as an 
assistant, and says he is persuaded he will be an acquisition to the States. The only thing against him is, 
that he comes without recommendatory letters. The 
Congress have I think very wisely resolved against 
employing any more foreigners unless they are forced 
to it by the special contracts of their embassadors, or 
very pointed recommendations. On this account the 
General has, in order that the baron might not lose so 
good an assistant, put the matter upon this footing : 
that Mr. Ternaut may exercise the office of sub-inspector without rank for the present ; and that when 
his practical abilities are as well known as his theoretical, Congress will determine a rank suitable to his 
merit. It is to be observed that he studied engineering particularly, and would have wished to join the 
corps here, but party differences were an invincible 
obstacle. He has not, however, confined his views to 
that branch of military science, but seems to be equally 
well instructed in every other. 
</p><p>
If an exception to the generally established rule is 
ever to be made, I think it can never be with more 
propriety than in favour of a person who merits such 
qualifications. 
</p><p>
The baron desires his friendly compliments to you. 
Apropos to him, his secretary, and a Mon r de Pontieres have certificates signed by the president of 
Congress setting forth that they are to have the rank 
of captains. 
</p><p>
I think they were not announced as such to the General. <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a>'s secretary is desirous of 
drawing his pay, and upon application to the General, who is not explicitly acquainted with the intentions of 
Congress in this matter, was required to draw on account. This has created some uneasiness in the 
Baron's mind, and he wishes to know whether Mr. Duponceau is not entitled to the pay, as well as rank of captain. 
</p><p>
I think if I could have half an hour's conversation 
with you, my dear father, I could prove to you so 
clearly how much the public interest is concerned in 
your remaining in Congress, that you would not 
refuse yourself to tins duty. Anticipating the pleasure 
of embracing you, I am, my dear father, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
