MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR favor, dated at Amsterdam in July, was last evening handed me, and this evening your letter of 
the 10th of September, by Colonel Ogden, reached me. I had for some time supposed that the delay 
of public business would retard your return ; and, knowing that the definitive treaty was not completed 
until September, and that the commercial treaty was still to form, I had little reason to expect you, unless 
your state of health required an immediate resignation of all public business. Your letter, therefore, 
which informs me of your determination to pass another winter abroad, is by no means unexpected. 
That we must pass it with a vast ocean between us is a reflection no ways pleasurable, yet this must be 
the case. I had much to do to persuade myself to venture a summer passage, but a winter one I never 
could think of encountering. I am too much of a coward. It is now the middle of November. It 
would be December or January, before I could possibly adjust all my affairs ; and I know of no person 
with whom I am acquainted, except Mr. Jackson of Newburyport, who is now going abroad. Mr. Temple and family sail this month. Besides, there is a stronger objection with me than even a winter s voyage. Congress have not appointed any person 
yet to the Court of Britain. There are many who wish for that place. Many who have a more splendid title, and many more thousands, to claim it with. 
I know Mr. Jay has written pressingly to Congress in your favor, and absolutely declined it himself; but whether you will finally be the person is among 
the uncertain events. One thing, however, is certain ; that I do not wish it. I should have liked very well 
to have gone to France and resided there a year ; but to think of going to England in a public character, and engaging, at my time of life, in scenes quite 
new, attended with dissipation, parade, and nonsense, I am sure I should make an awkward figure. The 
retired domestic circle, " the feast of reason and the flow of soul," are my ideas of happiness, and my most 
ardent wish is to have you return and become master of the feast. My health is infirm. I am still subject 
to a severe nervous pain in my head, and fatigue of any kind will produce it. Neither of us appears to 
be built for duration. Would to Heaven, the few remaining days allotted us might be enjoyed together. It has been my misfortune, that I could not 
attend to your health, watch for your repose, alleviate your hours of anxiety, and make you a home 
wherever you resided. More, says a skilful doctor, depends upon the nurse than the physician. My 
determination is to tarry at home this winter ; and, if I cannot prevail upon you to return to me in the 
spring, you well know that I may be drawn to you, provided there is any stability in Congress. One strong tie, which held me here, is dissolved. My 
dear parent used to say, " You must never go, child, whilst I live." It is far from being my inclination.

Mr. Thaxter will be able to give me, when he arrives, the best intelligence upon the subject. I wrote largely to you last week. I hope this letter will 
go by a French brig. 
</p><p>
Adieu, and believe me, whether present or absent, 
Most affectionately yours.
