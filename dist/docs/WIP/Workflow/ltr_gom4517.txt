Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot omit so good an opportunity of communicating to you my thoughts on the present situation of affairs. Knowing 
as I do, that your heart is actuated by the same principles of justice, and the same sentiments of policy, which, influence my 
own, I can venture on a freedom of communication which, to 
most men, would be imprudent. The approach of peace cannot but give very serious thoughts to every officer and soldier 
of the American army. The promises made by the public will, if performed, be of beneficial importance, and, if broken, 
extremely injurious. The main army have had anxieties on this subject ; and though I do not pretend to guess precisely 
their sentiments, I am convinced they will not easily forego their expectations. Their murmurs, though not loud, are 
deep ; and I do not think that the committee they have sent hither will, from their report, allay the apprehensions which were excited. 
</p><p>
From this committee, however, I learn that they were precipitating themselves in the road to ruin. I mean by pursuing 
a recommendation to the several States for compensation. 
This, which would have divided them into thirteen different 
parts, would have made it easy to elude the force of their applications, or, after their compliance, to have resumed any 
grants made in consequence of them, when the army should 
have been disbanded. At present, however, the committee have 
become so thoroughly persuaded, that the army will be defrauded, unless they unitedly pursue a common object, that I 
believe it will soon become the general sentiment. If the army, in common with all other public creditors, insist on the 
grant of general permanent fluids for liquidating all the public 
debts, there can be little doubt that such revenues will be obtained ; and there can be no doubt, that, when they are obtained, they will afford to every order of public creditors a solid 
security. The half-pay promised the officers is estimated to 
be worth five and a half years' full pay in hand. 
</p><p>
Admitting, then, that the proper revenues were obtained, 
the officer would be able always to sell his stock for the value. 
It is needless to say, that the United States have no other mode 
of paying the arrearages due to the army. It is also unnecessary to mention, that this kind of provision ought to be made 
for debts of every description. The effect of it, in all its 
parts, you will, I am sure, be at no loss to trace ; and you will 
agree with me in opinion, that Congress can, by that means, 
obtain a degree of influence essential to the happiness of this 
country. Now, my dear Sir, I am most perfectly convinced, 
that, with the due exception of miracles, there is no probability 
that the States will ever make such grants, unless the army be 
united and determined in the pursuit of it ; and unless they be 
firmly supported, and as firmly support the other public creditors. That this may happen must be the entire wish of every 
intelligently just man, and of every real friend to our glorious 
revolution,
