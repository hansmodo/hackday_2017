Sir, 
</p><p>
The Committee appointed by Congress to quiet the 
disturbances of the Pennsylvania line, &c., think it 
proper to inform your Excellency that they arrived 
at this place last night, after dark; and that President Reed, who acts in concert with us, has proceeded to the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, at which 
place those troops are now posted. We are happy to inform your Excellency, that some favorable appearances of a speedy and honorable, as well as a 
safe, accommodation have appeared in their conduct 
this morning, as they have given an earnest of their 
sincerity and intentions, by no means equivocal, by 
seizing a negotiator, sent to them from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
together with his conductor, both of whom they delivered up to <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, and have sent them 
out, under a guard, with their papers. They are actually now in the hands of President Reed; and we 
do ourselves the honor of sending your Excellency a 
copy of the terms offered them, in writing, by those 
emissaries. Should your Excellency have any communications to make to Congress relative to the present state and temper of the army, we request that 
you will be pleased to make them through us, and 
direct them to this place. I am, with the highest 
and the most sincere esteem and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">John Sullivan</a>. 
</p><p>
By order of the Committee.
