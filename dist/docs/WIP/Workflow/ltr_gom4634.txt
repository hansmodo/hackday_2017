My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write to you on the twenty-third of 
October. Since that date the exterior affairs of this country 
have put on a more steady appearance. My letter of the twenty-first instant to Mr Jefferson will communicate my view of 
things, to which I could add but little at this day. 
</p><p>
I have not mentioned to him the appointment of M. Genet, 
as Minister to the United States. In fact, this appointment 
has never been announced to me. Perhaps the Ministry think 
it is a trait of republicanism to omit those forms, which were 
anciently used to express good will. In the letter, which is 
addressed to you, is a strain of adulation, which your good 
sense will easily expound. Let it be compared with <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun's</a> letter to me of the 30th of August. The fact is, that 
they begin to open their eyes to their true situation ; and be 
sides they wish to bring forward, into act, our guarantee of 
their islands, if the war with Britain should actually take 
place. 
</p><p>
As to that war, I am told that the British ultimatum is as 
follows. France shall deliver the royal family to such reigning 
branch of the Bourbons as the King may choose, and shall re 
call her troops from the countries they now occupy. In this 
event, Britain will send hither a Minister, and acknowledge 
the republic, and mediate a peace with the Emperor and 
King of Prussia. I have several reasons to believe, that this 
information is not far from the truth, and that if the Ministers 
felt themselves at liberty to act, they would agree to the terms. 
These terms are, it is said, consequential to the sentiments de 
livered by opposition in the British Parliament ; who are, as 
you will see become quite insignificant, but it was thought best 
to place them in a necessity of supporting the measures of 
administration. 
I consider these terms, or something very like them, in a 
different point of view. If the French retire, and consequently eat up again their high toned declarations in favor of 
the people, and denunciations against Kings, they will, at the 
next attempt, find as many enemies as there are men in the 
neighboring countries, and of course the mediator will pre 
scribe such terms as he may think proper. Secondly, as it 
is almost evident that the republic must be torn to pieces by 
contending factions, even without any foreign interference, her 
population, wealth, and resources, above all her Marine, must 
dwindle away ; and as much of her intelligence and industry, 
with the greater part of her money capital, must on this hypothesis seek the protection of law and government on the other 
side of the channel, he r rival will increase both in positive and 
relative power. Thirdly, an exiled monarch on the other side 
of the Pyrenees, (for it is at Madrid that he would probably 
take refuge,) would enable Britain at any moment to distract 
the French affairs, and involve the republic in a war with 
Spain. Lastly, it seems an almost necessary conclusion, that 
if France in some years of convulsive misery should escape 
dismemberment, she would sink under severe and single despotism, and when relieved therefrom by the King, or his descendants, or relations, she would be in a state of wretchedness 
for at least one generation. 
</p><p>
I understand that the French, in the consciousness that 
their principles have ruined their colonies, are willing to pay 
them as the price of peace ; but on the other hand Mr Pitt 
has, I am told, refused the offers which the colonists have 
made to him, partly because he does not wish to excite alarm, 
and partly because the only useful part of the colonies, their 
commerce, will, he conceives, naturally fall to Britain in pro 
portion to the interior ruin, which has already made great 
ravages in this country. 
</p><p>
If the terms offered by Britain, whatever they may be, are 
not accepted, I think a declaration will not suddenly follow, 
but only an increase of preparations ; because time must be 
given for the co-operators, Spain and Holland, who are both of 
them slow. Besides, it will be necessary that a body of Prussian troops should be collected, through Westphalia, in the 
neighborhood of Flanders, to be joined by Dutch, Hanoverian, 
and perhaps British troops. The more the French advance, 
the more they expose themselves to this danger ; and you may 
rely, that if a large body of troops be thrown into Flanders, 
that country will join them eagerly to expel or destroy the 
French. 
</p><p>
I think it possible, that in case the war should break out , 
there may be a treaty of partition, in which the Elector Palatine 
may have Alsace and Lorraine in lieu of Bavaria, and that the 
Low Countries may be given by the Emperor, in exchange for 
Bavaria, to the Duke and Dutchess of York. This would 
suit everybody but France, and she will not in such case be 
consulted. 
</p><p>
I have not yet seen M. Genet, but Mr Paine is to introduce 
him to me. In the mean time I have inquired a little what 
kind of a person he is ; and I find that he is a man of good 
parts and very good education, brother to the Queen's first 
woman ; from whence his fortune originates. He was, through 
the Queen's influence, appointed as Charge d Affaires at Petersburg, and when there, in consequence of despatches from 
M. de Montmorin written in the sense of the revolution, and 
which he interpreted too literally, he made some representations in a much higher tone than was wished or expected. It 
was not convenient either to approve or disapprove of his con 
duct, under the then circumstances, and his despatches lay unnoticed. This, to a young man of ardent temper, and who, 
feeling genius and talents, may perhaps have rated himself a 
little too high, was mortifying in the extreme. He felt himself 
insulted, and wrote in a style of petulance to his chief, believing always, that if the royal party prevailed, his sister would 
easily make fair weather for him at court ; which I doubt not. 
At the overturn of the monarchy, these letters were so many 
credentials in his favor to the new government, and their dearth of men has opened his way to whatever he might wish. 
He chose America, as being the best harbor during the storm, 
and if my informant be right, he will not put to sea again until it is fair weather, let what will happen. 
</p><p>
In addition to what I have said respecting the King to Mr Jefferson, it is well to mention to you, that the majority have it 
in contemplation not only to refer the judgment to the electors of France, that is, to the people, but also to send him and his 
family to America, which Paine is to move for. He mentioned this to me in confidence, but I have since heard it from 
another quarter.. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you many and 
happy years.
