DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Your vigilance and foresight have saved us from the difficulties that threatened us. We are no longer afraid of starving. I 
wait now with impatience for the arrival of those troops, mentioned in your last, which I believe, from the number of boats on 
the way, will soon be here, to take the advantageous post I formerly spoke of, on a hill to the westward. 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had some proposals of an accommodation, through the channel of the Caghnawagas, from the formidable St. Luc le Corne, and other principal inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. To-morrow is appointed for a conference at Laprairie. I 
have sent Major Brown to manage it. Macpherson goes with 
him, and Mr. Livingston of Chamblee will attend. The result 
of this negotiation I hope soon to make you acquainted with. 
Mr. St. Luc's character gives me all the reason in the world 
to be on my guard against him. I shall insist on some substantial proof of his sincerity. Mr. Livingston, some days ago, took 
post at Hazen's house, with near two hundred Canadians. They 
are erecting a battery there, which seems to make the garrison 
very uneasy. 
</p><p>
Yesterday they attacked them with their row-galley, but were 
beaten back without loss on the side of the Canadians. No certain intelligence yet of Arnold's arrival, though there are flying 
reports to that purpose. I wish he was at <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, with all my 
heart. I believe there is nothing to oppose him. I am extremely happy you have sent for more powder. I believe we 
have not more than two and one-half tons. This I am afraid 
will not do. Send us as many men as you can possibly furnish with provisions. I am greatly in want of them. Our feebleness has intimidated the Canadians from embarking in so uncertain an adventure. Were I strong enough to send five hundred 
men to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, it would certainly declare for us ; at least I 
have great reason to think so. The miserable weather we have 
had has distressed us much, but I hope it is now over. 
</p><p>
Let the hard cash come as soon as possible, that our reputation may hold good. 
</p><p>
Mr. Carleton has not departed, as I informed you. We want 
both iron and steel, and turner's tools. The large mortar is 
ready to play, I shall send some more boats in a few days. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
