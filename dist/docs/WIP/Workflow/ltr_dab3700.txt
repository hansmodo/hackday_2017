Dear General, 
</p><p>
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter 
I have received from Colonel Bowman, and copies of 
three several letters from the Reverend Mr. Zeisberger. The accounts contained in them are somewhat 
alarming ; but I hope that my messages to the different Indian nations will prevent the British from 
carrying their expedition into execution. 
</p><p>
Captain-Lieutenant Brady is just returned from 
Sandusky. He took two squaws prisoners, within a 
mile of their principal town. One of them made her 
escape after six days march ; the other he brought to 
Cuscusky, where he met seven warriors, who had 
taken a woman and child from Chartier's Creek. He 
fired upon the Captain of the party and killed him, 
and has brought in the white woman and the Indian's scalp; but the squaw made her escape at the 
same time. When Captain Brady fired upon the Indian party, he had but three white men, and only 
two rounds of powder left. He was without provisions for six days, but has brought his whole party 
safe to this place. His perseverance, zeal, and good 
conduct, certainly entitle him to promotion; and I 
beg leave to recommend him to your Excellency's 
notice. 
</p><p>
I have provisions, at the dependent posts, for four 
weeks to come ; and, by collecting all the cattle in 
the possession of the Commissaries, this garrison may 
be subsisted for the same term. But what I shall 
do for further supplies, I cannot devise, unless I send 
out foraging parties, and impress cattle; for the public has neither money nor credit here. 
</p><p>
The artillery is arrived, and the military stores are 
safely lodged. The company consists of three officers, 
and twenty-five non-commissioned officers and privates. I have not had the honor of a line from your 
Excellency since that of the 14th of March; but I 
hope one may be on the road for me, before this 
reaches head-quarters. Captain McIntyre will set out, 
a few days hence, towards the Indian country, with 
a small party of men, to take some prisoners or 
scalps. With the most sincere respect and esteem, I 
have the honor to he, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most ohedient, and most humble servant,
