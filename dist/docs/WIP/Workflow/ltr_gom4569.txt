Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany what I had the honor to write on 
the twenty-fourth. In the afternoon of that day I received a note from Mr Burgess, appointing an hour on the twenty-fifth for an interview with the Duke of Leeds. I attended, 
but something or other kept his Grace away. The twenty-sixth I received a note apologizing for the disappointment, and 
requesting my attendance the twenty-seventh. I waited on 
him again. A note had been sent, informing me that a severe 
indisposition kept the Duke at home ; but this I did not receive 
in season to prevent the visit. Mr Burgess therefore mentioned to me the contents of it. The Duke, it seems, wished, if 
I had any communications to make before I went to Paris, that 
they should come through Mr Burgess. I told him, that as he 
well knew, I had to make none, and only put myself in the 
way of receiving them. He said that the business remained 
as it was when he last spoke to me ; that he could now say, 
however, the Duke had a person in his eye to be sent to 
America. I told him carelessly, that I had heard Mr Elliott 
was appointed. He said no appointment had been made ; it 
would be improper, until they should have determined what 
such person was to do. I smiled at this, and he was a little 
confused. He said he wished to make their communications 
through me, and hoped I should be again in London next spring. I told him, that perhaps I might, but that was of no 
consequence ; they could easily find a channel of their own. 
</p><p>
There was nothing in this which at all surprised me. It needs no comment,- and is, indeed, exactly what I expected. 
Next spring they will know better what to look for from their 
present negotiations. This intended appointment of Mr Elliott was during the height of the armament. He, on being 
spoken to, thought the affair was concluded, and mentioned it 
to his friends. One of them told me of it. At that time he 
was to have gone out immediately ; but the whole affair is now 
suspended. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
