Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Shortly after your departure from this place, I went to my 
farm, and returned hither last Sunday evening. Living out of 
the busy world, I had nothing to say worth your attention, or 
I should earlier have given you the trouble you must now experience. Although not very inquisitive about political opinion, I have not been quite attentive. The States eastward 
of New York appear to be almost unanimous in favor of the 
new Constitution, (for I make no account of the dissension in 
Rhode Island.) Their preachers are advocates for the adoption, and this circumstance, coinciding with the steady support 
of the property, and other abilities of the country, makes the 
current set strongly, and, I trust, irresistibly that way. 
</p><p>
Jersey is so near unanimity in her favorable opinion, that we may count with certainty on something more than votes, should 
the state of affairs hereafter require the application of pointed arguments. New York, hemmed in between the warm friends 
of the Constitution, will not easily, unless supported by powerful States, make any important struggle, even though her citizens were unanimous, which is by no means the case. Parties there are nearly balanced. If the assent, or dissent, ol 
the New York legislature were to decide OD the fate of America, there would still be a chance, though I believe the force; 
of government would preponderate, and effect a rejection. But the legislature cannot assign to the people any good reason, 
for not trusting them with a decision on their own affairs, and must therefore agree to a convention. In the choice of a 
convention, it is not improbable that the federal party will prove strongest, for persons of very distinct and opposite interests have joined on this subject. 
</p><p>
With respect to this State, I am far from being decided in my opinion, that they will consent. True it is, that the city 
and its neighborhood are enthusiastic in the cause, but I dread the cold and sour temper of the, back counties, and still more 
the wicked industry of those, who have long habituated themselves to live on the public, and cannot bear the idea of being removed from the power and profit of State government, which 
has been and still is the means of supporting themselves, their families, and dependants, and (which perhaps is equally 
grateful) of depressing and humbling their political adversaries. What opinions prevail more southward I cannot guess. 
You are in a better condition, than any other person, to judge of a great and important part of that country. 
</p><p>
I have observed, that your name to the new Constitution has been of infinite service. Indeed, I am convinced, that if 
you had not attended the Convention, and the same paper had 
been handed out to the world, it would have met with a colder reception, with fewer and weaker advocates, and with more 
and more strenuous opponents. As it is, should the idea prevail, that you will not accept of the Presidency, it would prove 
fatal in many parts. The truth is, that your great and decided superiority leads men willingly to put you in a place, 
which will not add to your personal dignity, nor raise you higher than you already stand. But they would not readily 
put any other person in the same situation, because they feel 
the elevation of others, as operating by comparison the degradation of themselves, and, however absurd this idea may be, 
yet you will agree with me, that men must be treated as men, 
and not as machines, much less as philosophers, and least of all 
things as reasonable creatures, seeing that in effect they reason 
not to direct, but to excuse, their conduct. 
</p><p>
Thus much for the public opinion on these subjects, which 
is not to be neglected in a country where opinion is everything. I am, &,c.
