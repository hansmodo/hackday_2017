DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 15th and 19th instant; and have the pleasure to acquaint you that, after a tedious march, 
we are returned to this place ; the fleet passed down 
by here yesterday, and did but little damage on their 
return. 
</p><p>
Some heavy artillery, and a reinforcement of Continental troops, I am informed by General Grates, are 
on their way to join me. By a deserter, and two of 
our people who escaped from the enemy at Yerplanck's Point, day before yesterday, I am informed 
that four regiments are gone from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to reenforce General Howe, which caused General Yaughan's 
hasty return down the river, probably to increase the 
reenforcement, as fifteen hundred of the York militia 
are ordered to be drafted, to supply their place at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I trust and hope the succour they are 
sending will arrive too late to relieve General Howe. 
We have collected twenty-three boats that escaped 
the enemy, some of which want repairing, besides the 
boats supposed to be left up Esopus Creek, and the 
new galley, which have not been reconnoitered. 1 
shall order the boats that want repairing to be re 
paired, and some new ones to be built immediately. 
With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
