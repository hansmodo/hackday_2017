MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, but not without some difficulty. My disorder increased rather than diminished, so that I was under the necessity of being carried in a litter a considerable part of the way. I 
consider it as a piece of the greatest good fortune 
that the Congress have detached a Committee to this 
place, otherwise I should have made a most ridiculous figure, besides bringing upon myself the enmity of the whole Province. My hands were effectually 
tied up from taking any step necessary for the public service by the late resolve of the Congress, put ting every detachment of the Continental forces under the command of the Provincial Congress where such detachment is. 
</p><p>
I should apprise you that General Clinton arrived 
almost at the same instant with myself. he has brought no troops with him, and pledges his honor that none are coming. he says it is merely a visit 
to his friend Tryon, If it is really so, it is the most whimsical piece of civility I ever heard of. He informs us that his intention is for North Carolina, 
where he expects five regiments from England ; that he only brought twO companies of light infantry from 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This is certainly a droll way of proceeding. 
To communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited.

The Congress Committees, a certain number of the 
Committee of Safety, and your humble servant, have 
had two conferences. The result of these conferences 
is such as will agreeably surprise you. It is, in the 
first place, agreed, and justly, that to fortify the town 
against shipping, is impracticable ; but we are to fortify lodgments in some commanding part of the city 
for two thousand men. We are to erect inclosed batteries on both sides the water near Hell Gate, which will answer the double purpose of securing the town 
against piracies through the Sound, and secure our 
communication with Long Island, now become a more 
capital point than ever, as it is determined to form 
a strong fortified camp of three thousand men on the 
Island, immediately opposite to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The pass 
in the Highlands is to be made as respectable as possible, and guarded by a battalion. In short, I think 
the plan judicious and complete. The two brass 
pieces and other articles will be sent down as you 
request. You have heard of the fate of the cannon 
near King's Bridge. As I write with pain, you will 
excuse my abrupt conclusion. 
</p><p>
Yours, dear General, 
</p><p>

P. S. My love to Gates and the rest, female and 
male.
