DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Immediately on my arrival here, I called for a re 
turn of the troops and Continental stores in this 
State, and the State of Georgia, but I have not yet 
obtained them ; otherwise, I should have done myself 
the honor of inclosing them; but, from all I can 
learn, there are very few Continental stores in either 
of the States. 
</p><p>
The troops have been supplied by this State ; and 
the heads of the several departments of Medical, 
Commissary, and Quarter-master, when supplies were 
necessary, have applied to the civil authority (there 
being no military chest here), who granted them, or 
not, as their own judgments dictated, which mode of 
doing business often created dissensions between the 
civil and military, and a militation of orders. 
</p><p>
In this situation I found matters, and that the 
army (to use Major-General Howe's own words) "had 
been in a state of abject dependency on the civil 
authority." Indeed, the Continental officer commanding in the department has not had it in his power, 
from the want of supplies which he could control, to 
march the troops without the consent of the President of this State, however urgent the necessity. I 
hope things will be better settled, and that I shall 
never be driven to the hard necessity of altercating 
with the civil power, than which nothing would be 
more disagreeable. 
</p><p>
The enemy from St. Augustine lately marched into 
Georgia. They summoned a small fort in Sunbury, 
but, satisfied with the spirited answer given by the 
officer commanding it, retreated over the Altaniaha 
River. They plundered negroes, cattle, c., to a 
considerable amount. I am not able to learn whether 
they have left the State or not. What was their 
original motive, whether a diversion of the troops 
here, whether to cooperate with a force from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or to secure a quantity of provisions, is not 
yet determined. I think the latter is most probable, 
though there are some reasons to suppose they expected to act in conjunction with a body from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
There are here very few troops, and I think a 
very small proportion of those called for by Congress 
will arrive. By the next opportunity, I hope to for 
ward the returns of the troops, and of the few Continental stores in this department. I have the honor 
to be, dear General, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
