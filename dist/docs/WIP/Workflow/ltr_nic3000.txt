SIR, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
your being appointed General of the Armies of the 
United Colonies, which hath given sincere pleasure 
to every friend of America, and will, I hope, prove 
glorious to yourself, and be attended with essential 
advantages to your country. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly of this Colony have the 
deepest sense of the necessity of a strict union, and 
the most vigorous efforts, of the Colonies to preserve 
them from unlimited servitude ; and their utmost Exertions in the common cause may be depended upon. 
</p><p>
I also assure your Excellency, that I shall give 
you every possible assistance in my power; and that 
I am with very great regard, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
