Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany a duplicate of what I had the honor 
to write on the twenty-third of last month. Since which, viz. 
on the sixth instant, I received yours of the tenth of June ; 
that of the twenty-ninth of April has not arrived. If I could 
have permitted myself to have formed a personal wish, it 
would have been precisely what has happened. To be recalled on the application of the Committee of Salut Public, and 
to preserve, at the same time, the confidence of government, 
is getting out of a wretched position on better terms than I 
ever hoped for. Accept, therefore, my thanks, my sincere 
and hearty thanks, and present them, I pray you, to the 
President. My only remaining wish respecting this affair is, 
that my successor may fully succeed, and realize the expectations of the United States, or even surpass them. 
</p><p>
It is, I think, proper to correct two things in my last now 
enclosed. First, as to the dissolution of the alliance against 
France. I incline to think, at present, that it will take on a 
new form, instead of being dissolved. Secondly, as to the 
harvest. It is less abundant than was supposed. I will not 
say anything, just now, respecting Robespierre, &c. &tc. If 
my return to America should be delayed, I will inform you 
pretty fully of the state of things by the first safe opportunity. 
Accept, in the mean time, the assurances of that esteem and 
respect, with which I am, my dear Sir, &c.
