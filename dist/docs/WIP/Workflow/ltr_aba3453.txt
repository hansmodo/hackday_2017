SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of June 13th, came duly to hand. If it 
had contained no other sentiments and opinions than 
those which my letter of condolence could have excited, and which are expressed in the first page of 
your reply, our correspondence would have terminated here. But you have been pleased to enter 
upon some subjects which call for a reply ; and as 
you observe that you have wished for an opportunity 
to express your sentiments, I have given them every 
weight they claim. 
</p><p>
" One act of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>'s life, and one only (you 
repeat) ever gave me a moment's personal displeasure. I did consider his last appointments to office as 
personally unkind ; they were from my most ardent 
political enemies." 
</p><p>
As this act, I am certain, was not intended to give 
any personal pain or offence, I think it a duty to 
explain it, so far as I then knew his views and 
designs. The Constitution empowers the President 
to fill up offices as they become vacant. It was in 
the exercise of this power, that appointments were 
made, and characters selected, whom <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
considered as men faithful to the constitution, and 
where he personally knew them, such as were capable of fulfilling their duty to their country. This 
was done equally by <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington</a> in the last 
days of his administration, so that not an office 
remained vacant for his successor to fill upon his 
coming into office. No offence was given by it and 
no personal unkindness thought of. 
</p><p>
But the different political opinions, which have so 
unhappily divided our country, must have given rise 
to the idea that personal unkindness was intended. 
You will please to recollect, Sir, that at the time 
these appointments were made, there was not any 
certainty that the Presidency would devolve upon 
you, which is another circumstance to prove that no 
persona] unkindness was intended. No person, I 
am sure, was ever selected from such a motive, and 
so far was <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> from harboring such a sentiment, that he had not airy idea of the intolerance of 
party spirit at that time. I know it was his opinion, 
that if the Presidency devolved upon you, except in 
the appointment of Secretaries, no material change 
would be made. I perfectly agree with you in opinion that those should be men in whom the President 
can repose confidence, possessing opinions and sentiments corresponding with his own ; or if differing 
with him, that they ought rather to resign their offices 
than to cabal against measures which he may consider 
essential to the honor, safety and peace of the country. Neither ought they to unite with any bold and 
daringly ambitious character to overrule the Cabinet 
or to betray the secrets of it to friends or enemies. 
The two gentlemen who held the offices of secretaries, when you became President, were not of this 
character. They were persons appointed by your 
predecessor nearly two years previous to his retirement. They had cordially cooperated with him, and 
were gentlemen who enjoyed the public confidence. 
Possessing, however, different political sentiments 
from those which you were known to have embraced, 
it was expected that they would, as they did, resign. 
</p><p>
I have never felt any enmity towards you, Sir, for 
being elected President of the United States. But 
the instruments made use of and the means which 
were practised to effect a change have my utter abhorrence and detestation, for they were the blackest 
calumny and the foulest falsehoods. I had witnessed 
enough of the anxiety and solicitude, the envy, 
jealousy and reproach attendant upon the office, as 
well as the high responsibility of the station, to be 
perfectly willing to see a transfer of it ; and I can 
truly say, that at the time of election, T considered 
your pretensions much superior to his who shared an 
equal vote with you. Your experience, I dare venture to affirm, has convinced you, that it is not a 
station to be envied. If you feel yourself a freeman, 
ai.d can conduct, in all cases, according to your own 
sentiments, opinions and judgment, you can do more 
than either of your predecessors could, and are 
awfully responsible to God and your country for the 
measures of your administration. I must rely upon 
the friendship you still profess to entertain for me, 
(and I am conscious I have done nothing to forfeit 
it), to excuse the freedom of this discussion, to which 
you have led with an unreserve, which has taken off 
the shackles I should, otherwise, have found myself 
embarrassed with. And now, Sir, I will freely disclose to you what has severed the bonds of former 
friendship, and placed you in a light very different 
from what some viewed you in. 
</p><p>
One of the first acts of your administration was to 
liberate a wretch, who was suffering the just punishment of his crimes for publishing the basest libel, 
the lowest and vilest slander which malice could 
invent or calumny exhibit, against the character and 
reputation of your predecessor ; of him, for whom 
you professed a friendship and esteem, and whom 
you certainly knew incapable of such complicated 
baseness. The remission of Callender's fine was a 
public approbation of his conduct. If abandoned 
characters do not excite abhorrence, is not the last 
restraint of vice, a sense of shame rendered abortive ? If the Chief Magistrate of a nation whose 
elevated station places him in a conspicuous light 
and renders his every action a concern of general 
importance, permits his public conduct to be influenced by private resentment, and so far forgets what 
is due to his character as to give countenance to a 
base calumniator, is he not answerable for the influence which his example has upon the manners and 
morals of the community ? 
</p><p>
Until I read Callender's seventh letter containing 
your compliment to him as a writer and your reward 
of fifty dollars, I could not be made to believe that 
such measures could have been resorted to, to stab 
the fair fame and upright intentions of one who, to 
use your own language, " was acting from an honest 
conviction in his own mind that he was right." This 
Sir, I considered as a personal injury ; this was the 
sword that cut asunder the Gordian knot, which 
could not be untied by all the efforts of party spirit, 
by rivalry, by jealousy, or any other malignant fiend. 
</p><p>
The serpent you cherished and warmed bit the 
hand that nourished him and gave you sufficient 
specimens of his talents, his gratitude, his justice and 
his truth. When such vipers are let loose upon society, all distinction between virtue and vice is levelled ; 
all respect for character is lost in the deluge of 
calumny ; that respect, which is a necessary bond in 
the social union, which gives efficacy to laws, and 
teaches the subject to obey the magistrate, and the 
child to submit to the parent. 
</p><p>
There is one other act of your administration 
which I considered as personally unkind, and which 
your own mind will easily suggest to you ; but as it 
neither affected character nor reputation, I forbear to 
state it. 
</p><p>
This letter is written in confidence. Faithful are 
the wounds of a friend. Often have I wished to have 
seen a different course pursued by you. I bear no 
malice. I cherish no enmity. I would not retaliate 
if it was in my power ; nay more, in the true spirit of 
Christian charity, I would forgive as I hope to be 
forgiven. With that disposition of mind and heart, I 
subscribe the name of 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
