My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received yours of the twentieth of October, which 
was very long on its way. You will find that events have 
blackened more and more in this country. The present prospects are dreadful. It is not so much perhaps the external 
force, great as that may be, for there are always means of de 
fence in so vast a nation. The exhausted state of resources 
might also be borne with, if not remedied. But the disorganized state of the government appears to be irremediable. The 
venality is such, that if there be no traitors, it is because the 
enemy have not common sense. Without the aid of venality, 
there are not a few who, from mistaken zeal, and from ignorance, contribute to the success of those powers who are leagued against France. Many also under the garb of patriotism 
conceal their attachment to the, former government. In short, the 
fabric of the present system is erected on a quagmire. The 
new constitution has not yet made its appearance, but it is easy 
to conjecture what it will not be. In the mean time I learn, 
that the ministers of War and Marine declare it impossible for 
them to go on. How all this will end, God only knows, but I 
fear it will end badly. 
</p><p>
I will not speak of my own situation ; you will judge that it 
is far from pleasant. I could be popular, but that would be 
wrong. The different parties pass away like the shadows in a 
magic lantern, and to be well with any one of them, would 
in a short period become the cause of unquenchable hatred 
with the others. 
</p><p>
Happy, happy America ; governed by reason, by law, by the 
man whom she loves, whom she almost adores. It is the pride 
of my life to consider that man as my friend, and I hope long to 
be honored with that title. God bless you, my dear Sir, and 
keep and preserve you. Your cool and steady temper is now 
of infinite consequence to our country. As soon as I can see 
the way open to anything decisive, I shall inform you of it. 
At present I weary myself with unavailing reflection, meditation, and conjecture. A partition seems the most probable 
event at present. Adieu.
