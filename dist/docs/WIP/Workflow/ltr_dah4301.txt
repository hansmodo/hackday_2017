My dear General, 
</p><p>
Finding an opportunity to <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a>, I could not 
excuse myself from giving you the progress of our 
negotiation since my last. 
</p><p>
On Monday last (that is to say, the day after the 
arrival of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and myself), a Deputation 
from all the Creeks of the Tuccasee, the Hallowing, 
and the Tallassee Kings, waited upon us, to congratulate us on our arrival ; to express^ in general terms, 
their desire of peace ; to smoke the pipe of friendship 
as a token of it; and to brush our faces with the 
white wing of reconciliation, in sign of their sincere 
intention to wipe away all past grievances. We gave 
them friendly assurances in return. They, with the 
fat King, the Euchee King, and two or three other 
great Chiefs, dined with us, and seemed well satisfied. In the afternoon, we crossed to the Indian 
camp, had an interview with McGillivray, showed him 
our full powers, and asked, in writing, for such evidence of theirs as the nature of the case would admit. Much general talk, expressive of a real desire 
to establish a permanent peace upon equitable terms, 
took place. 
</p><p>
The next day, McGillivray dined with us; and, although he got very much intoxicated, he seemed to 
retain his recollection and reason beyond what I had 
ever seen in a person when in the same condition. At 
this time I became intimate, to a certain degree, with 
him, and endeavoured to extract his real sentiments 
and feelings, in a conversation alone, confidentially. 
He declared he w^as really desirous of a peace ; that 
the local situation of the Creeks required that they 
should be connected with us rather than any other 
people ; that, however, they had certain advantages in 
their treaty with Spain, in respect to a guaranty and 
trade, which they ought not, in justice to themselves, 
to give up without an equivalent. Upon his desiring 
to know what were our intentions, especially as he 
knew from my character, and from my having been 
long in habits of intimacy with <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, 
that I would tell him what he might depend upon, 
I assured him, upon my honor, that our policy with 
respect to his nation was indeed founded upon honesty, magnanimity, and mutual advantages. We descended to no particulars, farther than my assuring 
him of our good opinion of his abilities, and desire to 
attach him, upon principles perfectly consistent with 
the good of his nation, to our interest. I concluded 
by intimating what, in that case, we might possibly 
consider ourselves at liberty to do for him. Mr. Griffin arrived that night. 
</p><p>
Wednesday was occupied in arranging the proposed 
draught of a treaty, and drawing up a talk to be delivered the next day. The other Commissioners desired me to go over the Oconee, and communicate 
these draughts in confidence to McGillivray. I did, 
and found him dissatisfied with the proposed boundary, and some other things. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> had, 
in the morning, been in McGillivray's camp, and 
agreed with him that the Chiefs should receive our 
propositions at our camp ; but, finding a jealousy prevailed with some of the Indians, lest a design might 
be formed to circumvent them, on my return we 
wrote that, if it was more convenient, we would make 
our communications in their camp. This proposal 
they acquiesced in very gratefully. On Thursday, at 
eleven o'clock, we were received with more etiquette 
than ever I had before witnessed, at the great ceremony of Blade Drink. We made our communications 
in the square of the nation, and returned. 
</p><p>
Yesterday morning McGillivray wrote to us that 
the Chiefs had been in Council until late the night 
before; that they objected to some part of our talks, 
and principally to that which related to boundary; 
that it w^as, however, his decision that the matter 
should rest as it was for the present ; and that a kind 
of truce should be established until they should hear 
further from us on the part of the United States. 
111 the mean time, he signified that some presents to 
the Chiefs would be necessary. In answer, we wrote 
him, after recapitulating the substance of his letter, 
that, as the Chiefs objected to some of the articles 
proposed by us, we desired to receive from them in 
writing the only terms upon which they would enter 
into a treaty with us ; that we were as well prepared 
to treat now as we should be at any other time ; we 
did not believe that it was by any means probable 
that the United States would ever send another Commission to them; and that we were not authorized to 
make any presents whatever, unless we should conclude a treaty of peace with them. 
</p><p>
Finding, from verbal information, that a capital misconception had happened to the Indian Chiefs, with 
regard to one of the rivers marked in the boundary, 
the other Commissioner wished me to go over to the 
Creek camp, explain the mistake to McGillivray, and 
make the necessary alteration in the draught. I had 
a very long private conversation with him, and he 
appeared for himself to be much better contented tho.n 
he had hitherto been. The difficulties in regard to 
boundaries seemed to be in a great measure overcome; and an apprehension of the ill consequences of 
their breaking with Spain, together with an earnest 
solicitude to have a free, unincumbered port, were 
now apparently the great obstacles. He was very 
much agitated, very much embarrassed, and hardly 
knew what to determine upon. 
</p><p>
After I left him, he expressed to an interpreter a 
belief, that a permanent peace might take place before we parted. How that may be, probably this day 
will decide. In the afternoon, yesterday, McGillivray 
sent over John Galphin, with Galphin's father-in-law, 
the Hallowing King, to acquaint us that all the 
towns, except the Cowetas, were removed about two 
miles back, for the sake of pasture for their horses. 
Should they go off without any further discussions, 
it will be a clear indication that they prefer a connection with Spain rather than with America; and 
that they wish for war rather than for peace. 
</p><p>
I have not leisure to give you a description of 
the person and character of McGillivray. His countenance has nothing liberal and open in it; it has, 
however, sufficient marks of understanding. In short, 
he appears to have the good sense of an American, 
the shrewdness of a Scotchman, and the cunning of 
an Indian. I think he is so much addicted to debauchery, that he will not live four years. He dresses 
altogether in the Indian fashion, and is rather slovenly than otherwise. His influence is probably as 
great as we have understood it was ; and his services 
may certainly be very important, if he can be sincerely attached to our interests. I hope to have 
hereafter the honor of reporting to you the substance 
of several confidential discourses, which have occurred 
between him and me. 
</p><p>
My most affectionate regards to Mrs. Washington 
and the family. Conclude me with every sentiment 
of devotion and consideration, my dear General, 
Your most obliged friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=dah" rel="me">David Humphreys</a>.  
</p><p>
P. S. The Commissioners have acted perfectly harmoniously in every measure which they have hitherto 
taken. The characters of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a> and Mr. Griffin have the greatest weight with McGillivray 
and the Creeks.
