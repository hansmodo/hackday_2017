My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I rec'd this morning your favor of the 29th ulto 
which did not reach me until the Committee to whom Mr Gales application was referred had decided upon it &amp; their 
report was adopted by the Board today. 
</p><p>
I have, indeed we all have, very favorable dispositions 
towards Mr Gales, &amp; would gladly assist him if it could be 
done with propriety. But it would be wrong for us to con 
sider the matter in any other than a pecuniary light or to treat 
it on any other than simple business principles. The value 
of his paper &amp; the advantage of its continuance are considerations entirely foreign to us^ and the very circumstance that 
but for the B. U. S. any newspaper would be discontinued, 
or that the Bank had gone out of its way in order to sustain 
any newspaper either in administration or in opposition would 
be a subject of reproach &amp; what alone makes reproach uncomfortable of just reproach to the Bank. I have striven to 
keep the Bank straight &amp; neutral in this conflict of parties, 
&amp; I shall endeavor to persevere in that course. If then the 
support of the Nat 1 Int r . offers no adequate temptation to 
hazard the property of the Bank, the loan is on business principles not a proper one. The responsibilities of the party now 
amount to a little above $50,000 : for this the Bank has it is 
conceived just enough &amp; no more to make the debt secure, &amp; 
all the other means of the parties are already pledged for 
other debts. The only chance there of any accession of means is in the contingency of their receiving the appointment of 
printers to the next Congress a contingency which a politician may regard as surrounded by different degrees of probability but which to a Banker seems an unsteady basis for 
a loan of $15,000. I am very sorry that we were obliged to decline but really saw no other course, unless we were ready 
in all impartiality, to furnish the means for a newspaper under the next administration. I have written thus freely 
because I thought it would interest you to know the fate of his application &amp; the reason of it.
