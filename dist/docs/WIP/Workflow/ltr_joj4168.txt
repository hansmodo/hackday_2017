Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Soon after receiving your letter of the 18th of September 
last, I was called to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> by the death of the only remaining child of my daughter, whose grief for the loss of her 
son and of her husband was still fresh and severe. 
</p><p>
I returned on the 3d of November with a pain on my 
side, which the doctor ascribed to an obstruction in the 
liver. The complaint increased, and kept me in close confinement during the winter and spring. It reduced me to 
such a state of debility, that I have as yet regained only 
sufficient strength to ride two or three miles at a time. I 
am better, but not well, and it is uncertain whether I ever 
shall be ; such mementoes are useful, though unpleasant, and 
therefore I ought to make the best of them. 
</p><p>
Your remarks relative to plaster will induce me, if I live, 
to extend the application of it to' the various objects you 
mention. I directed it to be freely used in the garden this 
spring, and am pleased with the results. The effect of 
plaster on vegetation is to me a mystery ; if it acts only by 
attracting water, why does the ground (as some say) grow 
tired of it, and require a supply of common manure to 
renew the efficacy of it. Often-repeated experiments, and 
long continued observation, naturally lead to important discoveries ; but the very limited duration of human life rarely 
allows sufficient time for the talents and perseverance of 
any individual to arrive at their "ne plus." Here the antediluvians had the advantage of us, and many of them doubtless made the most of it. Hence it may be presumed that 
they carried many of the useful arts, as well as those which 
belong to the departments of vice, to a higher degree of 
perfection than they are at present. To me it does not 
appear improbable, that the celebrated works of remote 
antiquity, were not a little indebted to information which 
passed through the flood. 
</p><p>
National interest unites, with other considerations, in 
drawing our attention to agriculture. I think it has greatly 
improved in our country since the revolution, and there is 
reason to believe that the " resuscitation" you are attempting would be generally useful. I wish it may be effected, 
but unless a number of gentlemen, well qualified for the 
purpose, will heartily and diligently unite with you, I fear 
your endeavours will not be so successful as they are commendable. 
</p><p>
You are right in supposing that we are much of an age. 
In December next, I shall have lived sixty-four years — a 
long course of years when to come — a dream when past. 
But whether life is, or is not composed of " such stuff as 
dreams are made of," it is a valuable gift, and is capable of 
many enjoyments, to be found by all who rationally seek 
and use them. Among the enjoyments which men derive 
from each other, those which arise from such social intercourse as you allude to, certainly are to be placed in the 
first class. This class, however, like the first class of almost 
every species of good, has more items in theory than in 
actual experience. 
</p><p>
I think with you that the Spaniards deserve credit for 
the spirit they have exhibited. There are fine points in 
their character. In a conversation respecting them, with 
the late Abbe Mably, he said, " Monsieur, ils sont plus 
hommes que nous." This was a great deal for a Frenchman to say. I sincerely wish them success, but my expectations of it have not been sanguine. Their hatred of 
France, and their attachment to their religion, &c, may 
continue to stimulate their indignation and their valour; 
but it does not appear to me that their opposition has been, 
or probably will be, so managed as to prove effectual. As 
yet, there has been no display of civil or military talents 
equal to the occasion; we may guess, but we cannot 
prophecy. 
</p><p>
Perilous times have descended upon all Europe, and Bonaparte seems to be the Nebuchadnezzar of the day. Divines 
say, that in prophetic language nations are called seas. 
According to that language, Europe is a tempestuous and 
a raging ocean ; and who can tell which of the governments 
afloat upon it will escape destruction or disaster ? Some 
dark clouds from that tempest have reached, and lately 
obscured, our political sky ; nor has it again become quite 
serene and clear. This country, as well as others, will 
experience deep distress ; but I do not believe that you or 
I will live to see it. From transitory and ordinary evils 
we cannot expect to be exempt. We may suffer from rash 
experiments, from the pressure of fraternal embraces or 
resentments, from the machinations of demagogues, and 
gradually from the corruption incident to the love of money, 
&c; but, for my own part, I do not apprehend any thing 
like the speedy approach of an " overturn." You have had 
a democratic tornado at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. It did but little 
harm ; perhaps it did some good. I found it gave you 
something to do ; and I found also, as I expected, that you 
did it. Too many in your State, as in this, love pure 
democracy dearly. They seem not to consider that pure 
democracy, like pure rum, easily produces intoxication, and 
with it a thousand mad pranks and fooleries. Ebriety, 
whether moral or physical, is dillicult to cure ; and the more 
so, as such patients cannot easily be convinced of the value 
and the necessity of temperance and regimen. 
</p><p>
I observe that I have written a long letter. Feeling a 
little fatigued, I must forego the pleasure of adding much 
to it. It is pleasant to think loud in safe company, and I 
sometimes allow myself that indulgence in writing. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>

P.S. A frost in this month has injured the leaves of this 
spring's shoots of my peach trees. Beans, cucumbers, &c. 
have also suffered by it.
