MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your kind favor of the 7th 
ultimo, on the 19th, accompanying your valuable present, the epaulettes and sword-knot. You will permit me to return my most cordial thanks for them, 
and to assure your Excellency that this testimony of 
your approbation of my conduct fills me with the 
highest sentiments of duty and affection, will always 
be remembered with the warmest gratitude, and ranked among the first honors which have been conferred 
upon me in life. I must have been insensible, in 
deed, not to have felt this honorary, and very particular mark of respect ; blind, not to have discerned 
the candor and friendship with which I have been 
treated, from my first being honored with a command 
under your Excellency; criminally inattentive, not to 
have noticed the concern you have expressed for my 
safety and perfect recovery ; and must ever be unhappy in reflection, should I not pay you that tribute of love and esteem which justice and gratitude indispensably demand.

My leg hath acquired such degree of strength, that 
I can bear considerable weight on it. There have 
been lately several exfoliations the openings are now 
small; the limb is free from pain and inflammation, and 
puts on a better appearance than it hath ever before.

By the advice of my surgeons, for the sake of a 
ride, I came to this town, the week before the last, 
with Mrs. Lincoln. She was immediately taken with 
the smallpox, in the natural way, and now lies very 
ill. I am, my dear General, with regard and esteem. 
Your obliged, humble servant, 
</p><p>
