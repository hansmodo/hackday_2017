Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 1st inst. informing me that I had been 
elected one of the vice-presidents of the American Bible 
Society, arrived by the last mail. 
</p><p>
I rejoice in the institution of that national society, and 
assure the Board of Managers, that I am very sensible of the 
honour they have done me, in thus connecting me with it. 
</p><p>
The events and circumstances under which such societies have been established and multiplied, in my opinion, indicate an origin, which makes it the duty of all Christians to 
unite in giving them decided patronage and zealous support. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with respect and esteem, 
Rev. sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
