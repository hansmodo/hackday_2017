Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to write to you a short letter on the third 
of last month. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> is since returned from 
his political campaign in Auvergne, crowned with success. 
He had to contend with prejudices, and the interests of his 
order, and with the influence of the Queen and Princes, 
(except the Duke of Orleans ;) but he was too able for his 
opponents. He played the orator with as much eclat as ever 
he acted the soldier, and is at this moment as much envied 
and hated as his heart could wish. He is also much beloved 
by the nation, for he stands forward as one of the principal 
champions for her rights. 
</p><p>
The elections are finished throughout this kingdom, except 
in the capital, and it appears from the instructions given to the 
representatives, (called here les Cahiers,) that certain points 
are. universally demanded, which when granted and secured 
will render France perfectly free, as to the principles of the 
constitution. I say the principles, for one generation at least 
will be required to render the practice familiar. We have, I 
think, every reason to wish that the patriots may be successful. 
The generous wish that a free people must have to disseminate freedom, the grateful emotion which rejoices in the happiness of a benefactor, and a strong personal interest as well in 
the liberty as in the power of this country, all conspire to make 
us far from indifferent spectators. 
</p><p>
I say, that we have an interest in the liberty of France. 
The leaders here are our friends. Many of them have imbibed their principles in America, and all have been fired by 
our example. Their opponents are by no means rejoiced at 
the success of our revolution, and many of them are disposed 
to form connexions of the strictest kind, with Great Britain. 
The commercial treaty emanated from such dispositions ; and 
according to the usual course of those events, which are shaped by human wisdom, it will probably produce the exact 
reverse of what was intended by the projectors. The spirit of 
this nation is at present high, and M. Necker is very popular ; 
but if he continues long in the administration, it will be some 
what wonderful. His enemies are. numerous, able, and 
inveterate. His supporters are indifferent as to his fate, and 
will protect him no longer than while he can aid in establishing 
a constitution. But when once that great business is accomplished, he will be left to stand on his own ground. The 
court wish to get rid of him, and unless he shows himself 
very strong in the States-General, they will gratify their wishes. 
His ability as a minister will be much contested in that assembly, but with what success time only can determine.

The materials for a revolution in this country are very indifferent. Everybody agrees that there is an utter prostration of 
morals; but this general position can never convey to an 
American mind the degree of depravity. It is not by any 
figure of rhetoric, or force of language, that the idea can be 
communicated. A hundred anecdotes, and a hundred thou 
sand examples, are required to show the extreme rottenness 
of every member. There are men and women who are 
greatly and eminently virtuous. I have the pleasure to number many in my own acquaintance ; but they stand forward 
from a back ground deeply and darkly shaded. It is how 
ever from such crumbling matter, that the great edifice of 
freedom is to be erected here. Perhaps, like the stratum of 
rock, which is spread under the whole surface of their country, it may harden when exposed to the air ; but it seems 
quite as likely that it will fall and crush the builders. 
</p><p>
I own to you that I am not without such apprehensions, for 
there is one fatal principle which pervades all ranks. It is a 
perfect indifference to the violation of engagements. Inconstancy is so miogled in the blood, marrow, and very essence of 
this people, that when a man of high rank and importance laughs 
to day at what he seriously asserted yesterday, it is considered 
as in the natural order of things. Consistency is a phenomenon. Judge, then, what would be the value of an association, should such a thing be proposed, and even adopted. The 
great mass of the common people have no religion but their 
priests, no law but their superiors, no morals but their interest. 
These are the creatures who, led by drunken curates, are now 
in the high road a la liberte, and the first use they make of it 
is to form insurrections everywhere for the want of bread. We 
have had a little riot here yesterday, and the day before, and I 
am told that some men have been killed ; but the affair was so 
distant from the quarter in which I reside, that I know nothing of the particulars. 
</p><p>
I am almost at the bottom of my paper, without mentioning 
what I at first intended. Six days ago I got from the maker 
your watch, with two copper keys, and one golden one, and a 
box containing a spare spring and glasses, all which I have de 
livered to Mr Jefferson, who takes charge of them for you. 
I am, &ic.
