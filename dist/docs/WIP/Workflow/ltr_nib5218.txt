My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
In consequence of your letter I wrote to the proper source suggesting the gentleman mentioned by you and 
have this morning an answer of which the following is an extract. 
</p><p>
" In regard to the appointment of Mr it is well known here that he is in embarrassed circumstances and his notes 
now in the Bank are considered discounted on one name, which however is unquestionably good. Repeated efforts 
have been made to obtain an additional name, in which we have failed. It is with much inconvenience he meets even 
his check of 10 per cent and his note for $3330 has recently passed the Board for the same amount (now under protest) 
on condition of his paying 20% on the next renewal. Under these circumstances however happy I should otherwise be 
to have him attached to the Board, I cannot at present consistently recommend him for a Director." This presents a 
strong case. Obliged as we are to look at the pecuniary side of men's characters, to be in embarrassed circumstances and to 
be even under protest, are deemed disqualifications for sitting at the Board which must decide on his own applications for 
loans. It is probable that you are not aware of these facts and I mention the subject thus early, so that in case you wish to 
make any further remarks on it, they may be in time for the election on the 11th of next month. I will only add that as the 
letter to me is in the most entire confidence, you will consider it in the same manner. I should particularly regret that 
your correspondent knew the source of the objection as it might excite personal hostility towards a very worthy man. . . .
