MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Your imagination was so glowingly alive in your 
last descriptive letter that mine lags after it in vain. 
From the vivid warmth of the coloring I should fancy 
that the cold north wind had not blown rudely upon 
you this season. 
</p><p>
For the numberless blessings which have crowned 
the past year my heart glows with gratitude and my 
mind expands in grateful acknowledgment to that 
bountiful Being who hath made me to differ from 
many others. 
</p><p>
In the year past, several of my friends and acquaintance have ceased from their labors. Their 
works remain with us. In the death of Mrs. Warren
and Vice President Gerry I recognise that of no ordinary characters. Mrs. Warren was like a shock of corn 
fully ripe for the harvest. The celestial spirit which 
animated the clay was not altogether extinct. It 
ascended to catch new life and vigor in the pure 
regions of bliss and to share in the joys of our heavenly inheritance. 
</p><p>
With Mr. Gerry died one of the first and oldest 
patriots of the revolution a firm steady and unshaken 
friend of more than fifty years ripening. " Such 
friends grow not thick on every bough." His age 
promised a longer life and his usefulness was not 
impaired by it. " Back-wounding calumny the 
whitest virtue strikes." He shared largely in the 
abuse of party factions and may have been kindly 
recalled before the next election lacerated his reputation and bespattered his fair and honorable fame. I 
rejoice that Mr. Gore's motion in the Senate prevailed, 
and think it an honorable trait in that gentleman's 
character to whom Mr. Gerry had been a successful 
political competitor and rival, to show himself superior 
to political division, and become the friend of the family by exerting himself to assist it. This is the 
temper and spirit of a Christian. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Your sister, 
</p><p>
A. A.
