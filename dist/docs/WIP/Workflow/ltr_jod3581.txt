MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE all along flattered myself with hopes that I 
might with propriety have taken leave of the Senate 
and returned home as soon as the roads might be settled, but such is the critical state of our public affairs, 
and I daily hear such doctrines advanced and supported 
by almost and, sometimes, quite one half of the Sen 
ate, that I shall not prevail on myself to abandon my 
post. This day, the senators were equally divided 
upon a question, which seemed to me to involve no 
thing less than peace and war, and I was obliged to 
decide it, to the no small chagrin of a number. If 
this country is involved in war, it shall not be by my 
fault ; but if it comes either from the malice of our 
enemies or the imprudence of our own people, it may 
perhaps be found that I shall not shrink from its difficulties sooner than some who now seek it in disguise. 
Business is now carried on with rapidity in both 
houses, and I shall have a month of severe duty. I 
have not been absent a day. It is, to be sure, a punishment to hear other men talk five hours every day 
and not be at liberty to talk at all myself, especially 
as more than half I hear appears to me very young, 
inconsiderate, and inexperienced.

The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> town meetine, as it terminated, did a 
service to the public. If government must be affronted or intimidated by popular clubs and partial 
meetings of the people, it is a pity that our cities are 
not all as capable as <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> of discussing great questions. But in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> there is 
meeting against meeting, and club against club, to 
the utter confusion of the public opinion. 
</p><p>
It is rumored that we are to lose two ministers of 
state l by resignation, but I would not have the report 
propagated from me. I suffer many melancholy 
hours on account of my dear mother, and as many 
on your account. Your trial must be severe, and I 
often wish I were with you to cheer up your spirits 
and share a part of your cares. The spring opens, 
the birds sing, the weather is fine, and all things cheerful, but my thoughts about my home and our public 
prospects. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear partner, ever your 
</p><p>
JOHN ADAMS,
