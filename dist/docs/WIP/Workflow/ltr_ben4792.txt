SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt of the Truth of what the Papers tell us, 
that a certain great Person is half-starved on the Blade-Bone 
of a Sheep (I cannot call it of Mutton, there being none on 
it) by a Set of the most careless, worthless, thoughtless, 
inconsiderate, corrupt, ignorant, blundering, foolish, crafty, 
& knavish Ministers, that ever got into a House and pretended 
to govern a Family and provide a Dinner. Alas for the poor 
old England of Craven Street! If they continue in Power 
another Week, the Nation will be ruined. Undone, totally 
undone, if I and my Friends are not appointed to succeed 
them. I am a great Admirer of your useful and impartial 
Paper ; and therefore request you will insert this without fail, 
</p><p>
from 
</p><p>
Your humble Servant, 
</p><p>
"INDIGNATION."
