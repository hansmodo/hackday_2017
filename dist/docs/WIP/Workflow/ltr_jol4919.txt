My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
This will be delivered to you by the Chevalier de 
Mauduit de Plessis, whose name I mentioned to you 
in one of my late letters. I am happy in having an 
opportunity of recommending so worthy a man to your 
protection. he was employed by the Commander in 
chief, to act at Red Bank in the capacities of engineer 
and commandant of artillery, and acquitted himself 
so well as to obtain panegyricks approaching to rapture from the officers who were witnesses of his conduct. The alterations which he made in the works of 
his post shew'd that he had not contained himself to 
one branch of military knowledge, but had extended 
his studies with success to one which is generally held 
as a mystery apart. His admirable behaviour during 
the action which proved fatal to so many daring Hessians ; his saving some valuable artillery and stores by 
preferring the public interest to his own safety; his 
exposing his life by blowing up the magazine at Fort 
Mercer without the preparation which is usually made 
in such cases for the security of the operator, and his 
gallant conduct on all occasions, entitle him to the 
promotion which his Excellency solicits for him. The 
letter which Mr. Duplessis now carries to Congress 
would have gone in the order of time, if his modesty 
had not made him backward in speaking of himself. 
I interest myself greatly in his success because I know 
his merit. As this is the only reason that can prevail 
with you to befriend any man who is soliciting public 
reward, I recommend this gentleman with confidence ; 
and if it is in your power to assist him in procuring a 
brevet of lieutenant colonel, expressing the reasons 
for his promotion, and bearing date the 26th November, in order that those who are not his seniors in 
France may not have a right to command him here, 
I entreat you to do it, as you will essentially serve a 
young man, whose military ardour and talents make 
him valuable to the United States. 
</p><p>
I am with every sentiment of filial affection your 
</p><p>

</p><p>
As there is a great demand for commissions, his 
</p><p>
Excellency desires me to apply for a large number of 
blanks to be sent by the next courier. 
The Honble Henry Laurens, Esq r ., 
President of Congress.
