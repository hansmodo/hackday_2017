SIR, 
</p><p>
Thursday night I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, and immediately gave orders for moving the Continental troops 
over the bay to <a href='/results.php?city=greenwich' rel='city'>Greenwich</a>; but, the weather proving 
so very stormy the whole day, that could not be effected before Saturday evening. I came myself that 
night to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, and gave orders for Jackson's 
regiment, stationed here, to march this morning for 
Plainfield ; if the weather continues tolerable, I have 
no doubt but the whole will reach <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> Saturday. 
I have advised with those who are the best acquainted with the different routes at this season of the 
year ; they all prefer that by <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, upon account 
of the facility of passing the ferries, and the goodness of the roads that way. 
</p><p>
I shall bring with me only four pies of light 
brass field artillery, and propose leaving what is 
called the park, here, with a small guard to take 
care of it. If your Excellency wishes more to be 
brought forward, it may be easily done after the receipt of your farther orders. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
