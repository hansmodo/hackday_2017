My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the twenty-fifth of March. 
Not having had time to read the gazettes , which are but just 
(and but in part) arrived, I cannot from them derive the in 
formation you allude to, but my first glance at them shows 
what I am sorry to see, and from thence I am induced to 
quote a sound maxim from an excellent book. { JL house divided against itself cannot stand. 
</p><p>
As to your re-acceptance, Sir, you know my sentiments, 
which on that, as on some other subject, are, I think, unchangeable. It will be time enough for you to have a successor, when 
it shall please God to call you from this world's theatre. If 
such successor is then able to fill the President's chair, it will 
be matter of surprise to those, who can from a competent idea 
of the office, but during your life I consider the thing as utterly impossible. And do not imagine, my dear Sir, that you can 
retire, though you may resign. You will in such case become 
the man of the opposition, however your good sense may differ 
from their madness, and your ^irtue from their villany. De 
pend on it, theyw ill cite you as being of their sentiment. If 
you are silent you assent, and if you speak you are committed. 
In the mean time your poor successor is obliged to struggle 
under all the weight of your reputation, as well as that of the 
office ; and he must be a strong man who can carry either ; of 
course a very rash man who would attempt to take up both. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find, that the determination to maintain 
a strict neutrality is so general in America. I shall not dwell 
on that topic, because my several letters to Mr Jefferson contain enough of it to weary your patience. By the bye, I am 
mortified more than I can tell you, at the delay my letters experience in their passage. I task my mind to its utmost bent 
to discover those events, which are most likely to happen, in 
order that (so far at least as my judgment can be relied on) 
you may be duly prepared, and after all you hear of the event 
before my almanac comes out. This is provoking, and would 
be much more so, did I not find from experience that the 
things I wish are done as well, and perhaps better than if my 
conjectures had reached you. 
</p><p>
I trust that long ere this you will have received what I had 
the honor to write on the twenty-eighth December, sixth and 
tenth January, and fourteenth February. You will have seen 
that in the end of last month and beginning of this, the long 
expected insurrection took place, by which a new set of men 
are brought into power. Sould the present society be able to 
establish themselves, I think M. Genet will have a successor ; 
and if, the revolution completed, things return to the point 
from whence they started, I am sure M. Genet will have a 
successor. As to those who rule, or rather the few by whom 
they are directed, you may depend that they have just ideas 
of the value of popular opinion. They are not, however, in 
a condition to act according to knowledge, and should they be 
able to reach a harbor, there will be quite as much of good luck 
as of good management in it. At any rate, a part of the crew 
will be thrown overboard. It is my opinion that the members of the Convention lately arrested will do nothing, for the 
greater part of them have only parole energy ; and if I were 
called on by any cogent motive to act, it should be in conformity to that idea. In my letter to Mr Jefferson of this day I 
tell him, that I shall implicitly obey his orders; but this is in 
reply to the broad hint, that my embarrassments may have 
arisen from inattention to the principles of free government. 
You may rely, Sir, that I shall be cautious to commit the 
United States as little as possible to future contingencies. In 
my last letter I gave you my idea of popularity : 
</p><p>
I have never thought that three parties would conveniently 
exist in any one country, and therefore it seems to me that 
one of those into which they who call themselves democrats 
are divided, must join the royalists. I do not inquire what 
negotiations are carried on to that effect, for I have no desire 
to meddle with such affairs, directly or indirectly, and should 
be very sorry to have the appearance of siding with any one 
party or faction whatever, being convinced that I can best do 
the business of the United States by keeping aloof from them 
all. 
</p><p>
Those who command the royal or Christian army, as they 
call themselves, on the Loire, are good officers. Their enemies have, in my mind, passed the highest eulogium on tlrem, 
in saying that the soldiers are brought to such a pitch of folly 
and madness, as to rush on, armed only with clubs, and possess themselves of the artillery to whose fire they were expos 
ed. As far as I have been able to learn, they profess them 
selves the friends of order and justice, and act conformably to 
such professions, protecting both persons and property wherever they arrive, and paying for whatever they take. Hence 
it happens, that their dominion is constantly extending itself, 
and if they should get possession of Nantes, which seems to be 
their present object, they will be truly formidable, because 
then by means of the Loire a passage will be opened into the 
heart of the kingdom for as many troops as foreign powers 
may choose to send thither, or if they should prefer fighting 
the battle with Frenchmen, they, need only furnish money and 
warlike stores, and they would have as many men as they 
please, and the most fertile part of France to subsist in. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir ; may God bless and keep you, not 
merely for your sake, and still less for that of your friends, but 
for the general good of our country.
