DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received your favor by master George, and have carefully observed the contents. I have had a Captain, one Sergeant, and 8 picked men 
out in the upper part of my regiment for some time, in order to prevent those fellows from plundering the good people, and to have them taken 
and brought to justice. I am about to try to embody a part of the regiment to send to town ; how they will turn out I can't tell, but I fear 
but poorly. I have made it as public in these parts, as possible, about 
the Governor promising to get salt for the back country ; and it has 
given some satisfaction to the people but at present it is bad, for 
many a poor man is obliged to turn out his hogs for the want of salt. 
To my knowledge some people must suffer greatly. I have sent a pay 
bill of Capt. I. Gray's with Mr. McNear to get the money, and should 
take it as a singular favor if it could be got. The Captain deserted his 
country, and the men will probably lose their money, and I am likely 
to be a great loser by it myself. I have advanced a great part of their 
</p><p>
wages to them myself. If I could get the money, I am going to that 
part of the regiment, and will settle with every man myself. If it is 
possible, I should be glad to get the money, as I am going to that part 
of the regiment the latter end of this week. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most respectful and humble servant, 
</p><p>
