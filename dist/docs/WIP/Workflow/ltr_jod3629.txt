MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE received in your favor of the 15th an entertaining account of Vortigern and Rowena.
</p><p>
Our wagon is mired to the axletree in a bog, and 
unable to advance or retreat. The people only can 
draw it out ; but whether it will be backwards or for 
wards I know not. The horses upon Portland hill 
employed to draw up hill, are so equally matched 
with the load and those behind, that the wheels can 
roll neither up nor down. Pegged like Ariel in a rifted oak, we can only sprawl in the air with our 
arms and legs, and fill the atmosphere with our cries 
and clamors. 
</p><p>
I forgot to mention the young men's land. I must 
have it. I always understood there were but eleven 
acres. The price is exorbitant. But pray the doc 
tor to make the best bargain he can, and finish the 
business. I mean the land of the young Haydens. 
</p><p>
The charming letter from our son I return. I 
know very well all his meaning. He will see man 
kind in his youth. 
</p><p>
I am, with attachments and wishes and affections 
unutterable, 
</p><p>

Yours of the 18th reached me in four days, i. e., 
on the 22d. I know your difficulties. I mean to do 
very little at farming. I will let out on shares all I 
have next year. I see no prospect of leaving this 
city before the fifth or sixth of June. Obstinacy 
must be resisted with rational firmness and steadiness.
