Dear General, 
</p><p>
I informed your Excellency, this morning, that the 
enemy were on the advance, in force. I now acquaint you that they proceeded, with vigor, until 
they had gained Connecticut Farms ; they then were 
checked by Colonel Dayton's regiment. They have 
since advanced, in two formidable columns, on the 
Springfield and Vauxhall roads. After very obstinate 
resistance, they are now in possession of Springfield, 
with one column ; with the other, they are advanced 
near the bridge leading to Vauxhall where Angell's 
pickets lay. From present prospects, they are directing their force against this pass, which I am determined to dispute, so far as I am capable. They are 
pushing a column to our left, perhaps to gain the 
pass in our rear towards Chatham. If they pursue 
this object, we must abandon our present position 
The militia turn, and are few ; and that few are so 
divided as to render little or no support. 
</p><p>
They advance with seven pieces of artillery in 
front, and appear not disposed to risk much. The militia are collecting, and I hope to derive support 
from them. I am 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
