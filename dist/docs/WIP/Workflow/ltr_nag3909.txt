DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 16th June and 8th July I have had the pleasure to 
receive, and am made happy that you have brought Major Ganey, and 
his party, to submit to the laws of the State without making much use 
of force. Nothing reflects more honor upon an officer than accomplishing that by address which others could effect only by force; to save the 
effusion of human blood must be the wish of every humane and generous 
bosom. I fancy you must be mistaken about Mr. RavenePs being in 
confinement. Capt. Warren, our Commissary of prisoners, was in town 
to examine the state of all the prisoners, as well militia as regulars; his 
report contains no such thing. Capt. SkeJly is released in consideration of Judge Pendleton being set at liberty. The Judge has come 
out, and Capt. Skelly gone in. Should it be found that Mr. Ravenel 
is in confinement, which I cannot suppose, I will write to Gen. Leslie 
on the subject. It is evidently for the interest of those corps of Maham 
and Hampton to be incorporated. Neither would have existence long 
without it; but, by being consolidated, they will have, perhaps, a permanency during the war, and provision made for them accordingly. 
You will inform the officers thereof, that it is a matter settled between 
the Governor and myself, that the two corps be united, and that they 
are to be considered in future upon the State establishment. This was 
thought advisable after the fullest examination of the matter, and I 
</p><p>
hope the officers will make no difficulty in concurring in a measure 
equally beneficial to them, as necessary for the public good. The requisition for the militia was upon the supposition that the garrison of 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> might come to Charlestown, and give the enemy such an 
additional force as to enable them to give a blow to our army. I believe 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> is not fully evacuated, and therefore nothing to apprehend at 
present; you will remain, therefore, on the other side of Cooper River, 
between that and Santee, to protect the people from the daily depredations of little parties from Charlestown. If the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> 
arrives, I will notify you, and direct you where to form a junction with 
me. It is said that Fanning is determined to have you, dead or alive, 
therefore, take care of yourself. It is, also, reported, by a person in the 
enemy's secrets, that a large party of the enemy is to move out soon 
into St. Thomas and St. Stephens parishes. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

By a woman from town last night, I have just heard the garrison of 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> is actually arrived at Charlestown. If it should prove true, 
you will hear from me again immediately.
