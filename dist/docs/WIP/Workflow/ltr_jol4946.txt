My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have to ask pardon for omitting in my last, to 
thank you for the striped dimity, which you were so 
kind as to send me. It did not occur to me till it 
was too late to recall the messenger, and my uneasiness was the greater, as I had heen frequently a delinquent in this way. 
</p><p>
Yesterday we celebrated the new alliance, with 
as much splendour as the short notice would allow. 
Divine service preceded the rejoicing. After a pro 
per pause, the several brigades marched by their right 
to their posts in order of battle, and the line was 
formed with admirable rapidity and precision. Three 
salutes of artillery, thirteen each, and three General discharges of a running fire by the musquetry, were 
given in honour of the king of France, the friendly 
European powers, and the United American States. 
Loud huzzas ! 
</p><p>
The order with which the whole was conducted, 
the beautiful effect of the running fire, which was 
executed to perfection, the martial appearance of the 
troops, gave sensible pleasure to every one present. 
The whole was managed by signal, and the plan, as 
formed by <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a>, succeeded in every 
particular, which is in a great measure attributed to 
his unwearied attention, and to the visible progress 
which the troops have already made, under his 
discipline. 
</p><p>
A cold collation was given afterwards, at which all 
the officers of the army, and some ladies of the neighbourhood were present. Triumph beamed in every 
countenance. The greatness of mind and policy of 
Louis XVI were extol'd , and his long life toasted with as much sincerity as that of the British king used to 
be in former times. The General received such 
proofs of the love and attachment of his officers as 
must have given him the most exquisite feelings. 
</p><p>
But amid all this inundation of joy, there is a con 
duct observed towards him by certain great men 
which, as it is humiliating, must abate his happiness. 
I write with all the freedom of a person addressing 
himself to his dearest friend, and with all the unconstraint of a person delivering an unconsequential 
private opinion. I think, then, the Commander in 
Chief of this army is not sufficiently informed of all 
that is known by Congress of European affairs. Is it 
not a galling circumstance, for him to collect the 
most important intelligence piece-meal, and as they 
choose to give it, from gentlemen who come from 
York ? Apart the chagrin which he must necessarily 
feel at such an appearance of slight, it should be considered that in order to settle his plan of operations 
for the ensuing campaign, he should take into view 
the present state of European affairs, and Congress 
should not leave him in the dark. 
</p><p>
If ever there was a man in the world whose mode 
ration and patriotism fitted him for the command of a 
republican army, he is, and he merits an unrestrained 
confidence.

You will receive copies of letters from and to the 
genera], respecting Monsieur de Neuville. If I recollect right, that gentleman aims at the rank of brigadier. This, I can venture to assure you, the General does not think either politic or proper to be granted to 
him. I took the liberty of mentioning this, that the 
General's letter which is couched in polite terms, 
might not induce an opinion of his approving the 
demands of M. de la Neuville. The general thinks 
him a man of merit and liberal sentiments, but that 
he looks too high. I take the liberty which is 
allowed when the restraint of officiality is laid, to say 
many things which cannot with propriety be said in 
public letters. And am with as much respect for you 
in your public capacity, as love and friendship in our 
</p><p>
private relation, 
</p><p>
Your
