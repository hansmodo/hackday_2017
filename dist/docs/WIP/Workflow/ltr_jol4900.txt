My Dear Uncle : 
</p><p>
I arrived here the 7th inst,, and have since had the pleasure of conversing, at three different times, with 
<a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met">Doctor Franklin</a>. His accounts of America are, that she will be much better provided for, the ensuing 
campaign, than she was for the last ; that the members of the congress are as unanimous, as the members of 
popular assemblies generally are ; and that the spirit of the people does not, by any means, flag. It is a 
secret yet whether France will assist America or not. The fact, as it appears to me, is, that France does not 
choose to involve herself in a war by declaring herself openly, when she can give special succors without any 
risk. There are more French officers in America than can find employment ; the French ports are daily 
receiving American vessels. Some time ago, two armed vessels, one of which was loaded with military 
stores, were cleared out for St. Domingo, and a number of French officers took their passages in them. By some means or other, Lord Stormont discovered that 
these vessels were employed by <a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="">Silas Deane</a>, and the cargoes intended for America. He went immediately, 
at an unusual hour for business, to Versailles, and represented the matter to M. de Vergennes, minister and secretary for the foreign department; he had obtained an exact list of every thing on board ; said 
he had sufficient proof that the whole was designed for the rebellious English colonies; and demanded that these vessels should be stopped. The answer was 
that a courier should be dispatched ; a courier was dispatched, but the bird had flown. 
</p><p>
To-night, I take place in the diligence for Bordeaux, from whence I hope soon to embark for my own country. Cochran has sailed, which I am very 
sorry for, as my acquaintance with him, and the good character of his vessel, made me wish to be his passenger. 
</p><p>
Present my tenderest love to my dear aunt and sisters. I am afraid I shall not be able to write to 
my dear Patty. That God may grant you all his blessing, is the constant prayer of your most affectionate 
</p><p>
