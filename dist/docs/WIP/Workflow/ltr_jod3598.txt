MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
ALTHOUGH the -weather is the most beautiful I ever 
knew in December, the time seems longer to me than 
ever any time did in America. The business of Congress this session is dulness, flatness, and insipidity 
itself.

I have been much engaged in reading the trials of 
Muir, Margarot, Watt, Downie, and Walker. Mr. Walker, of Manchester, appears to have been very 
ill used by the church party ; but he was honorably 
acquitted. The others, I suppose, could not be held 
guiltless according to the laws of Scotland and England. The severity, however, of their sentences 
may excite rather than suppress discontent and mu 
tiny. Self-created societies must be circumspect. It 
is very easy for them to trangress the boundaries of 
law, and as soon as they do, they become unlawful 
assemblies, seditious societies, mischievous conventions, pernicious associations, dangerous and destructive combinations, and as many such hard appellations as you choose to give them. I take it for 
granted that political clubs must and ought to be lawful in every free country. I belonged to several in 
my youth, and I wish I could belong to one now. It 
would save me from ennui of an evening, which now 
torments me as bad as the blue devils would if I had 
them, which, by the way, I never had, and so can t 
say by experience. Low spirits and blue devils are 
not the same. 
</p><p>
I think I will read Svvedenborg's works. I dare 
say they are as entertaining as the Pilgrim's Progress, 
or Robinson Crusoe, or the Seven Champions. Any 
thing that shows a strong and strange imagination, 
and is neither melancholy nor stark mad, is amusing. 
I fear the atheistical and theistical philosophers, lately 
turned politicians, will drive the common people into 
receptacles of visionaries, enluminees, illuminees, 
&c., &c., &c., for the common people will undoubtedly insist upon the risk of being damned rather than 
give up the hope of being saved in a future state. 
The people will have a life to come and so will I. 
</p><p>
I fear you will think me a little crazy, so I conclude. I send you a history of Geneva. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
