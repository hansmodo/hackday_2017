Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this day honoured with your letter of yesterday. 
I expect to sail in the course of a fortnight, and, if my 
prayers and endeavours avail, my absence will not be of 
long duration. 
</p><p>
From the confidence you repose in me, I derive the most 
pleasing emotions, and I thank you for them. Life is uncertain â€” whether I take your letter with me, or leave it here, 
it would, in case of my death, be inspected by others, who, 
however virtuous, might be indiscreet. After much reflection, I conclude it will be most prudent to commit it to you, 
without retaining any copy or memorandum, except in my 
memory, where the numerous proofs of your kind attention 
to me are carefully preserved. 
</p><p>
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and affectionate servant, 
</p><p>
