Dear Kitty, 
</p><p>
Why so long silent, my good friend ? Many months 
have elapsed since we have been favoured with a line from 
you. I hope want of health has not obliged you to deny us 
that satisfaction. Want of inclination, I am sure, has not. 
Of that we have received too many unequivocal proofs to 
entertain the most distant doubt. You have long been my 
faithful, steady friend. I know the value of your esteem 
and regard, and be assured that you possess mine in a very 
high degree. Much do I wish for the happy moment when 
we shall all meet, and when Ave shall communicate to each 
other many things, which, however interesting, must be 
very sparingly trusted to paper. The necessity of this 
caution has imposed upon us a long and painful reserve, for 
between friends, few things are more agreeable, as well as 
useful, than free and undisguised communications. This is 
a pleasure to which I have been greatly a stranger since I 
left America, and it is in that country only that I expect 
again to enjoy it. Experience has taught me reserve, but 
it has also taught me that with you it will he unnecessary. 
This is a pleasant idea, and my mind dwells upon it with 
great satisfaction. How few are there in this world, my 
dear Kate, capable of a firm, uniform attachment; much 
fewer, I assure you, than I once thought: but youth is 
credulous, and consequently must be often disappointed. 
I hope my disappointments are nearly at an end ; for I expect very little, except from you and a few others.

I have letters from Sally almost every week. Thank God, she continues well. She tells me our little girls grow 
charmingly. My absence from her has been much longer than I expected. On coming to London, I was taken ill of 
a dysentery, and afterward, with a sore throat. Some remains of the latter still trouble me. Upon the whole, 
however, I am better, and the waters of this place have 
done me good. I propose next week to return to London, 
and from thence make the best of my way to France. I 
am impatient to be with my little family, and to have my 
sweet little girls upon my knee, while their mother tells me 
the domestic occurrences which have happened in my absence. Believe me to be, with great and sincere regard, 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant, 
</p><p>
