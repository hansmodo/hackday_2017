MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
You say Mr. H. is very full of his praises of <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>. So is Dr. Edwards. He says <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a>'s correspondence will do him infinite honor when 
it comes to be published, and all that. Monroe's house has been a school for scandal against his country, its government and governors, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a> and his 
treaty, &c. Edwards says, as Dr. Rush told me, 
that Washington's character was in total contempt in 
France. This I shall not believe till I have better 
evidence than that of any or all these great person 
ages ; nay, than all the Directory, Ancients and five 
hundred.

<a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Madison</a></a> is to retire. It seems the mode of becoming great is to retire. Madison, I suppose, after a retirement of a few years, is to be President or 
Vice President. Mr. Cabot, I suppose, after aggrandizing his character in the shade a few years, is to be 
some great thing too ; and Mr. Ames, &c., &c., &c. 
It is marvellous how political plants grow in the shade. 
Continual daylight and sunshine show our faults and 
record them. Our persons, voices, clothes, gait, air, 
sentiments, &c., all become familiar to every eye 
and ear and understanding, and they diminish in pro 
portion, upon the same principle that no man is a hero 
lo his wife or valet de chambre. These gentlemen 
are in the right to run away and hide. Tell Mr. Cabot so if you see him. His countrymen will soon 
believe him to be a giant in a cave, and will go in a 
body and dig him out. I wish, but don t tell Cabot 
so, that they would dig up Gerry.

I have bespoken a chariot, and am treating for 
horses. We read of a vessel from Rotterdam arrived 
at Lisbon, or its neighborhood, by which I hope there 
may be letters from our young friends, as late as the 
middle of November. My anxiety for letters from 
them increases every day. They have more accurate views and intelligence than any others, and, 
what is of more importance still, more application 
and industry. 
</p><p>
The weather has moderated a little. I am, with 
anxious desires to see you, which I fear cannot be 
gratified before July, 
</p><p>
Yours forever, 
</p><p>
