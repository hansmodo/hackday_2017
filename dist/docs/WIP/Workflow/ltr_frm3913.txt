SIR: 
</p><p>
I send you two letters addressed to Gov. Martin, which you will send 
by express that may be depended on it requires expedition. I send a 
letter for Ganey; please forward. Mrs. P has abused the trust 
reposed in her, in making use of the pass more than once. You may 
permit Mr. Dyer to bail for his future good behaviour. I am sorry to 
find the guard at Cat Island do not do their duty, in suffering boats to 
pass the Musketoe Creek. I hope some steps will be taken to prevent 
such an evil so much to the prejudice to our service. The few men of 
yours here are not to be spared yet, and hope you will make yourself 
satisfied, as it is not in the power of government to get money as yet to 
pay the troops in her service, but hope, it will be soon. Col. Moultrie 
will give you all the news here ; I have not time just now to write 
them to you. 
</p><p>
I am your obedient servant,
