My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
At this late hour, and from this remote corner, J am to ac 
knowledge your favors of the 19th and 25th of June. I did 
not reply from Paris, because I wished for a safe conveyance ; 
and although none offers itself at present, yet I will write what 
occurs for communication, and take a future chance for transmission. 
</p><p>
The assurances of friendly esteem, which your letters convey, are very pleasing ; but, indeed, I never doubted of the 
sentiments you express, and even go so far as to natter myself, 
that the measure in question was not agreeable to you. It 
was highly so to me, and although I am persuaded that you 
will believe me, on my word, I will nevertheless assign some 
reasons why a change of situation was desirable. 
</p><p>
And first, you will see from what is publicly known respecting those, who administered the French despotism, how painful it must have been to represent our virtuous Republic to 
such persons. I had stayed, at some risk, after the 10th of 
August, because I thought the interests of America required 
it, and I did not ask my recall at a subsequent period, because 
it would not have been honorable to abandon a post which, if 
no longer unsafe, was at least very unpleasant. I felt that I 
was useless, and indeed that nobody could be useful, until 
some permanent system should be established. I saw misery 
and affliction every day, and all around me, without power to 
mitigate, or means to relieve ; and I felt myself degraded by 
the communications I was forced into with the worst of man 
kind, in order to obtain redress for the injuries sustained by 
my fellow citizens. 
</p><p>
During that state of things, I was grossly insulted by the arrest of a lady in my house, by order of the Committee of 
General Safety. I could not resent this, as I ought to have done, by quitting the country, because a great number of our 
citizens were then detained in France, with much of their 
property, and I knew the violence which those who administered the government were capable of. Moreover, I saw with 
regret, that the temper of America was not such as her best 
citizens could have wished ; and the conduct of Britain, rendered a temporizing conduct with France indispensable. My 
representations obtained a half apology and promise of satisfaction, but occasioned the order to solicit my recall ; of which I 
was apprised within four and twenty hours after it was given, 
and might easily have shown whence it originated ; but, to tell 
you the truth, I was inclined to wish that I might be removed 
on their application. I really believe it was necessary to my 
reputation. So long as they believed in the success of their 
demand, they treated my representations with indifference and 
contempt ; but at last, hearing nothing from their Minister on 
that subject, or indeed on any other, they took it into their 
heads that I was immovable, and made overtures of conciliation. 
</p><p>
At this time I began to apprehend, that we should be plunged into a war with England, in which case it would have be 
come my duty to aid the French as far as my abilities might 
go; but as I knew their temper, I replied to the advances 
made, that I was not to be affected by smooth words, so that 
they must begin by complying with the various demands I had 
made, and show me by facts that they were well disposed. 
Shortly after this, I received a volunteer letter from the Commissary of Exterior Relations, (a poor creature, who scarce 
dared to do anything without an order from the Committee of 
Safety), assuring me that he had transmitted my various representations to the Commissary of the Marine, and expected 
soon to give me satisfactory answers. It was written ten days 
before the death of Robespierre, shortly after which, Mr Monroe arrived. He was fortunate in not reaching France at an 
earlier period ; for, if I may judge by what fell within my observation, he would have been a little too well with that party, 
to be viewed in a neutral light by their opponents. I hope he may succeed in obtaining the redress of those grievances, 
which our countrymen labored under ; but on the 12th of October, when I left Paris, nothing was done. I build my present hopes, however, on Mr Jay's treaty, for they will now be 
somewhat more cautious respecting us than they have been. 
</p><p>
In reply to what you say about my return to America, I 
must tell you, that I could not depart in such season as that 
my communications could be of much importance, and there 
fore as I must have exposed myself to the inconveniences of 
a winter's passage, I deferred my voyage ; and the rather, as I 
have some affairs in London which I wish to wind up. I 
should have gone thither for that purpose direct, but the 
French would have harbored jealousies respecting my journey, which for many reasons I wished not to excite, and 
therefore I came round through Switzerland to this city, in 
which I am now weather bound. So much for my history. 
</p><p>
As to the state of political affairs, the Polish insurrection 
is, as you know, completely subdued, and of course the attention of Europe is all turned to France, which has lately 
triumphed in every quarter by the extreme misconduct of her 
enemies. It seems at present that they are coming to their 
senses, and if I am rightly informed, they have at length 
abandoned the idea of a dismemberment, and mean to pursue 
simply the re-establishment of the throne. If they act wisely 
and vigorously in that direction, it seems to to me that they 
must succeed, for the French are wearied and exhausted by 
the contest. They detest and despise their present rulers, 
and as far as I have been able to judge, they ardently desire 
the restoration of their Prince. 
</p><p>
You will ask, perhaps, why then do they not restore him ? 
It is because they dare not act, nor even speak, so that they 
do not know each other's opinions, and of course each individual apprehends from the general mass ; but everything 
which has taken place leaves them to look back with regret 
to their ancient situation. In judging the French, we must 
not recur to the feelings of America during the last war. We 
were in the actual enjoyment of freedom, and fought not to 
obtain, but to secure its blessings. The people elected their 
magistrates during the continuance of the war. The property 
of the country was engaged in the Revolution, and the oppressions which it occasioned were neither great, extensive, 
nor of long duration. 
</p><p>
But in France they have been lured by one idle hope after 
another, until they are plunged in the depth of misery and 
servitude ; servitude so much the more degrading, as they 
cannot but despise their masters. I have long, you know, 
predicted a single despotism, and you have seen how near 
they have been to that catastrophe. Chance, or rather the 
want of mettle in the usurper, has alone saved them to the 
present moment ; but I am still convinced, that they must end 
their voyage in that port, and they would probably reach it, 
should they make peace with all their foreign enemies, through 
the channels of a civil war. Adieu, my dear Sir. I wish you 
many and happy years, and am very truly yours,
