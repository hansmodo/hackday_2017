Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received the honor of your letter of this day's 
date. I well remember the nature of the conversation you allude 
to, as well as the particular points upon which the two countries mutually complain of a non-observance of treaty. Each 
party may perhaps have reason for complaint. I can assure you, 
Sir, 1 sincerely lament it. I am not entering into a ministerial 
discussion upon the subject of our not being already further advanced, in what we are both interested in, a real bond fide intercourse of friendship, but am only acknowledging, confidentially, my own private opinion, and what it has not been hitherto in 
my power to remedy. 
</p><p>
I shall, I trust, be enabled very soon to address myself upon 
a new subject to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>General Washington</a> ; and in the mean time, 
shall be very happy to see you, Sir, before your departure for 
America. I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.
