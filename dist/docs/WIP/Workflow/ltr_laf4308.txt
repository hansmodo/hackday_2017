The inclosed, my dear General, is a vocabulary 
which the Empress of Russia has requested me to 
have filled up with Indian names, as she has ordered 
a universal dictionary to be made of all languages. 
It would greatly oblige her to collect the words she 
sends, translated into the several idioms of the nations on the banks of the Ohio. Presley Neville, 
and Morgan, at <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, and General Muhlenberg, 
in Fayette county, and our other friends, would undertake it for us, and would be very attentive to accuracy. I beg your pardon, my dear General, for the 
trouble I give you, but have been so particularly applied to that I cannot dispense with paying great 
attention to the business. 
</p><p>
This goes with so long an epistle of mine, that I shall only present you here with my best love and 
wishes; and I am my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your respectful and tender friend,
