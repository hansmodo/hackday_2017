Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with your letter of the 2d ultimo, 
respecting the African Free-school in the city of New-York. 
It is, in my opinion, a charitable and useful institution, and 
well entitled to encouragement and support. From your 
account of its present embarrassments, I am induced to think 
that, in order to its being and remaining on a respectable 
and permanent footing, some vigorous and well devised 
measures should be in ken to obtain adequate and durable 
funds. The uncertain donations occasionally solicited and 
expected from charitable, but scattered and unconnected 
individuals, will, probably, be always incompetent, and 
must obviously be too precarious to afford ground for seasonably calculating the prudence and extent of expenditures. 
</p><p>
The existing debts should doubtless be paid : indeed they 
cannot be paid too soon, and it is desirable that new ones 
be not contracted. For my part, I am persuaded that it 
can very seldom be discreet, for institutions depending on 
charity to contract debts, and then apply to charity to pay 
them. 
</p><p>
What should be done? is the question. Two things 
occur to me, which I will take the liberty to suggest. 
</p><p>
First, The society of Friends in general, and particularly 
those in New- York, have given more patronage to the 
objects connected with this school, than any other society 
or denomination in the State ; and. from circumstances 
peculiar to their association and discipline, they are enabled to pursue and accomplish their objects with more than 
ordinary union and effect. 1 fence, 1 am led to believe, that 
it those of your society in New-York would recommend 
this school to the notice and liberality of their brethren in 
the country, and desire them also to requesl the aid of all 
-disposed persons, of other denominations, in their 
respective neighbourhoods, a considerable sum might he 
collected; especially considering the prudence, as well as 
zeal, with which your affairs arc usually managed. On this, 
or any other plan which would in some degree be general 
through the country, 1 would readil) be one of the contributors. 
</p><p>
aidly. I submit to your consideration the expediency 
of regularly putting at interest one-tenth of the annual 
income of the school, whatever it may he, and wh ; :ver 
it may arise, and invariably to bring the yearly e\ 
ot the school to a level with the remaining nine-tenths. ( In 
this plan both the principal of the stable funds, and the income of the school (so far as if comprehended the interest 
ol those lends) would increase from year to year. In time, 
the interest alone would form an income so considerable, as 
to be productive of more good, than if the institution had 
continued to depend and subsist on scanty and precarious 
supplies. 
</p><p>
It may also be well to consider, whether the benevolent 
objects of this institution might not be promoted by an act 
of incorporation, with such provisions in it as would conduce to its stability, and extend its usefulness. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to inform me whether any particular attention 
is paid by the superintendents to the children after they 
have left it, and whether it is part of th plan to endeavour 
to have them bound out to trades, or to service in decent 
families. To me it appears important that they be not left 
entirely either to their parents or to themselves; it being 
difficult to give them good morals, manners, or habits, in 
any other way than by placing them under the care and 
direction of persons better qualified for those purposes than 
their parents generally are. 
</p><p>
With esteem and regard, I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
