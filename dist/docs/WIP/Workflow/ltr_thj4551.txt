Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter of the 16th instant, with its documents accompanying this, will sufficiently inform you of the transactions which 
have taken place between M. Genet, the Minister of France, 
and the government here, and of the painful necessity they 
have brought on, of desiring his recall. The letter has been 
prepared in the view of being itself, with its documents, laid 
before the Executive of the French government.* You will, 
therefore, be pleased to lay it before them, doing everything 
which can be done on your part, to procure it a friendly and 
dispassionate reception and consideration. The President 
would, indeed, think it greatly unfortunate, were they to take 
it in any other light ; and therefore charges you very particularly with the care of presenting this proceeding in the most 
soothing view, and as the result of an unavoidable necessity on 
his part. 
</p><p>
M. Genet, soon after his arrival, communicated the decree 
of the National Convention of February 15th, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, authorising 
their Executive to propose a treaty with us on liberal principles, such as might strengthen the bonds of good will, which 
unite the two nations ; and informed us in a letter of May 23d, 
that he was authorised to treat accordingly. The Senate being then in recess, and not to meet again till the fall, I apprised 
M. Genet that the participation in matters of treaty, given by 
the constitution to that branch of our government, would of 
course delay any definitive answer to his friendly proposition. 
As he was sensible of this circumstance, the matter has been 
understood to lie over till the meeting of the Senate. You will 
be pleased, therefore, to explain to the Executive of France this 
delay, which has prevented as yet our formal accession to their 
proposition to treat, to assure them that the President will 
meet them with the most friendly dispositions, on the grounds 
of treaty proposed by the National Convention, as soon as he 
can do it in the forms of the constitution, and you will of 
course suggest for this purpose, that the powers of M. Genet 
be renewed to his successor. I have the honor to be, &ic.
