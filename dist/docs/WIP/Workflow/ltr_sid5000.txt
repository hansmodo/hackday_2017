I wrote you every material occurrence to the time of my leaving Bordeaux, and sent duplicates by Captains Palmer, 
Bunker, and Seaver, one of which you will undoubtedly have received, before this comes to hand. I left that city 
on the last of June, and arrived here the Saturday following, having carefully attended to every thing in the manufacturing or commercial towns in my way, which, indeed, 
are neither numerous nor of great consequence. I spent at Angouleme a day in viewing what, as to manufactures alone, 
deserves attention on the journey ; the foundery for cannon, where the greatest part of those used in the kingdom are 
manufactured. The cannon are cast solid, after which they 
are put as in a turner's lathe, and bored out, and the outside smoothed and turned at pleasure ; they can bore and 
complete a twelve pounder in one day in each lathe, which takes four men only to work ; the workmen freely showed 
me every part of their furnace and foundery. On Monday after my arrival, I waited on my bankers, and found that 
Mr Bancroft had arrived the same day with me, Mr Thomas Morris and M. Venzonals about ten days before. I 
waited on M. Dubourg and delivered him <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>'s letter, which gave the good gentleman the most sincere and real pleasure. 
</p><p>
M. Penet, on his arrival in Paris, waited on M. Dubourg, showed him a copy of his contract with the committee of 
Congress, and told him he had letters from <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> to him, but had left them on the road, or at Rotterdam, through 
fear of a search ; he told M. Dubourg, to whom he was a perfect stranger, so many particular circumstances, that he 
could not doubt of his sincerity, and in consequence he embarked in his affairs to a large amount. Five or six 
weeks have now passed without the arrival of the letters said to be left on the road. Arms, powder, Sec. to a large 
sum were in readiness, when my arrival gave him confidence, that I would take the burden off him, as he doubted 
not that my credentials would be explicit. I saw immediately the arrangement of the whole, and that M. Penet 
had returned to France, (copy of the contract excepted,) almost as empty handed as he came to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, yet 
had found means to collect a very considerable quantity of stores, part of which he had actually shipped. This circumstance gave me hopes, yet I found that it would now be 
expected I should become responsible for the articles, which embarrassed me much, since to detain them would 
be quite disagreeable, and to step out of my own line and involve myself with Messrs Plairne and Penet's contract, would be equally so. 
</p><p>
M. Penet had somehow got intelligence of my being in France, and that I was expected at Paris ; he, therefore, 
waited for me, and I saw him the next day at my hotel, when he complained of want of remittances, and desired 
me to pledge my credit for the stores, which I waived in the best manner I could, for I saw the consequences might involve me in many difficulties, and frustrate my greater 
designs. I, therefore, told him I would certify to the merchants, if necessary, that the Congress would pay for 
whatever stores they would credit them with, and in the mean time, advised him to proceed strictly agreeable to the 
letter of the contract, and I was positive that the Congress would fulfil their part of it. I fully satisfied both him and 
M. Dubourg, and he parted for Nantes to ship the goods the next day. I must do him the justice that is his due ; 
he has been indefatigable in the business, his heart seems to be entirely in it, and I believe him honest, but his connexions either commercial or political are not, of themselves, equal to such an undertaking, but the cause he was 
employed in, had, in a great measure, I found, supplied this deficiency, which was to me a favorable appearance. 
M. Dubourg told me that the ministers would not see me, as they meant to be quite secret in any countenance 
they gave the United Colonies, and that my arrival in France was already known in London, in consequence of 
which Lord Stormont arrived express but a few days before, 
and had applied to the court on the subject. I showed him 
my commission, and told him I was determined to apply ; 
for every circumstance, in my opinion, was favorable instead 
of otherwise. On this he wrote a letter to Count de Vergennes, asking liberty to introduce me the Thursday following, on which day I went to Versailles, and though the letter had not been delivered to his excellency, yet he gave us 
immediate admission. Fortunately his chief secretary 
spoke English well, by which means I had an opportunity 
of conversing freely with him on the subject of my commission for two hours, and was attentively and favorably 
heard by him, and was asked many questions, which shows 
that the American disputes had been, and still were a principal object of attention. I pursued nearly the line marked out 
by my instructions, stating the importance of the American 
commerce and the advantages Great Britain had received 
from a monopoly of it. That all intercourse ceasing between 
the two countries the Colonies had considered where they 
might dispose of that produce, which they necessarily had 
so large a surplus of, and receive for their raw or first materials the various manufactures they wanted. That they 
first turned their eyes on France, as the best country in 
Europe for them to be connected with in commerce. 
That I was purchasing a large quantity of manufactures for 
which I expected to pay the money, and that I should want a quantity of military stores, for which remittances would 
be made. That I doubted not the Colonies had before this declared independency, and that I should soon receive 
instructions in consequence, more full and explicit ; ilnit in the mean time they were very anxious to know how such a 
declaration would he received by the powers in Europe, particularly by France, and whether, in such case, an ambassador would be received from them, &.c. 
</p><p>
To which he replied, that the importance of the American commerce was well known, and that no country could 
so well supply the Colonies, and in return receive their produce as France ; it was, therefore, the interest of both to 
have the most free and uninterrupted intercourse, for which reason the court had ordered their ports to be kept open, 
and equally free to America, as to Britain. That, considering the good understanding between the two courts of 
Versailles and London, they could not openly encourage the shipping of warlike stores, but no obstruction of any kind 
would be given ; if there should, as the custom houses were not fully in their secrets in this matter, such obstructions should be removed, on the first application. That I 
must consider myself perfectly free to carry on any kind of commerce in the kingdom, which any subject of any other 
state in the world might, as the court had resolved their ports should be equally free to both parties. That I was 
under his immediate protection, and should I meet with any 
difficulty, either from their police, with the rules of which he supposed me unacquainted, or from any other quarter, 
I had but to apply to him and every thing should be settled. That as to independency, it was an event in the womb of 
time, and it would be highly improper for him to say any thing on that subject, until it had actually taken place ; mean 
time he informed me, thai the British ambassador knew of my arrival, a;id therefore advised me not to associate with 
Englishmen, more than I was from necessity obliged; as he doubted not I should have many spies on my conduct. 
</p><p>
I then told him the precautions I had taken and should 
persevere in, in coming from Bermuda, and that I did not 
mean in public to pass for other than a merchant from that 
island, on speculation, during the present cessation of commerce in America ; but at the same time I told his excellency, that I was well assured it was known in London, that I 
was coming long before I arrived at Paris, and I doubted 
not, they conjectured my errand, but at the same time, I 
should take every precaution in my power ; and most sincerely thanked him for his protection and assistance so generously offered, which he might depend I would never 
abuse. He was pleased with my having come by Bermuda, and passing as an inhabitant of that island, and said, if 
questioned, he should speak of me in that character. He 
then asked me many questions with respect to the Colonies, 
but what he seemed most to want to be assured of, was their 
ability to subsist without their fisheries, and under the interruption of their commerce. To this I replied, in this manner, that the fisheries were never carried on, but by a part 
of the Colonies, and by them, not so much as a means of subsistence, as of commerce. That the fishery failing, those 
formerly employed in them turned part to agriculture, and 
part to the army and navy. That our commerce must for 
sometime be in a great measure suspended, but that the 
greater part of our importations were far from being necessaries of life, consequently we should not suffer under the 
want of them, whilst it was not wealth or luxuries that we were contending for. That our commerce ceasing, it would 
be out of the power of our enemies to support themselves on 
our plunder and on the other hand, our ships, as privateers, might harass their commerce, without a possibility of their 
retaliating. That I hoped to see a considerable marine force in the Colonies, and that, joined to the impossibility of 
Britain's guarding so extensive a coast, would preserve some of our commerce, until it should be thought an object deserving the protection of other powers. 
</p><p>
After many questions on this subject, he put this, in which I thought he seemed interested, — whether, if the Colonies 
declare an independency, they would not differ among themselves ? To this I replied, that the greatest harmony 
had as yet subsisted, and I had no grounds to doubt it in future ; that the common danger, which first drove them into 
measures, which must end in such a declaration, would subsist, and that alone was sufficient to ensure their union. 
</p><p>
He then desired me to give his secretary my address, and said, though he should be glad to see me often, yet as 
matters were circumstanced, his house was too public a place but that I might put the same confidence in his secretary as himself, to whom I might apply for advice and direction, but that whenever any thing of importance occurred, I need but inform him, and he would see me ; but on 
common occasions, I must address the secretary, which would be every way more convenient as he understood the 
English language well, and was a person in whom the greatest confidence could be placed. Having settled the mode 
of intercourse, I expressed the sense I had of his excellency's politeness, and the generous protection he had given 
me, and on parting said, if my commission or the mode of introducing the subject were out of the usual course, I must 
rely on his goodness to make allowances for a new formed people, in circumstances altogether unprecedented, and for 
their agent wholly unacquainted with courts. To which he replied, that the people and their cause were very respectable in the eyes of all disinterested persons, and that the interview had been agreeable. 
</p><p>
After this I returned to Paris with M. Dubourg, whose 
zeal for the American cause led him to draw the most 
favorable consequences from this beginning. The next day 
while from home I was informed that count Laureguais had 
inquired out my lodgings, immediately after which he asked 
leave to go for England, which was refused him by the 
court. The same day I was informed that Sir Hans Stanley and Sir Charles Jenkinson, who I knew were at Boidcaux when I left it, were in France, for the sole purpose of' 
inquiring what agents were here from the Colonies, and 
what commerce or other negotiation between diem and the 
Colonies was carrying on. This alarmed ray friends, and 
as I had agreed for other lodgings, to which I was next day 
to remove, M. Dubourg advised me to secrete both, my 
lodgings and name. I told him that the count Laureguais' conduct appeared mysterious, yet I could never think 
of keeping myself secret, for though I should not seek these 
gentlemen, nor throw myself purposely in their way, yet I 
must think it an ill compliment to Count Vergennes, to suppose after what had passed, that I was not on as good and 
safe footing in France, as they or any other gentleman could be. However, his uneasiness made him write to the Count 
what he had advised, who returned for answer, that such a step was both unnecessary and impolitic, as it would only 
strengthen suspicions by giving every thing an air of mystery, while there was not the least occasion for it. 
</p><p>
The next day I had a fresh conference with M. Dubourg, who brought me a number of memorials from officers and 
engineers offering their services in America ; some of whom, I believe, deserve the utmost encouragement ; but 
more of this hereafter. While I was casting in my mind, how best to improve the present favorable crisis for supplying the 
Colonies, Monsieur Beaumarchais made proposals for procuring whatever should be wanted, but in such a manner as 
was understood by M. Dubourg to amount to- a monopoly, which indeed was not his only objection, for Monsieur 
Beaumarchais, though confessedly a man of abilities, had always been a man of pleasure and never of business ; but 
as he was recommended by Count Vergennes, Dubourg could not avoid noticing him, but immediately expostulated 
with the Count in a letter, which brought on embarrassments no way favorable, and I saw that M. Dubourg was so far 
from sounding the views of his superior in this manoeuvre, that he was, with the best intentions in the world, in danger of counteracting his own wishes, the extent of which were, to obtain the supplies of merchants and manufacturers on the credit of the Colonies, in which the strictest 
punctuality and most scrupulous exactness would be necessary, and which under the present difficulties of remittance, 
I feared would not be lived up to. 
</p><p>
As I had learned, that in the late reform of the French army, they had shifted their arms for those of a lighter kind, 
the heavy ones, most of which were the same as new, to the amount of seventy or eighty thousands, lay useless in magazines, with other military stores, in some such proportion, I apprehended it no way impossible to come at a supply 
from hence, through the agency of some merchant, without the ministry being concerned in the matter. In such case 
the merchant would be accountable to the ministry, and the Colonies to the merchant, by which means a greater time 
of payment might be given, and more allowance in case of our being disappointed. With this in view I went to Versailles on Wednesday, the 17th, and waited on M. Gerard, 
first secretary of foreign affairs, and presented to him the enclosed memorial, which led to a very particular conversation on the affairs of America, and which I turned finally on this subject, to which he would not then give me 
any immediate answer, but promised me one in a day or two. Returning to town, I found Messrs Dubourg and 
Beaumarchais had a misunderstanding, the latter giving out that he could effect every thing we wished for, and the 
former, from the known circumstances of M. Beaumarchais, and his known carelessness in money matters, suspecting he 
could procure nothing, and the more so as he promised so largely. They parted much displeased with each other, 
and Mons. Beaumarchais went directly to Versailles. On M. Dubourg's coming and informing me what had passed, 
I immediately wrote to M. Gerard the enclosed letter, and in return was desired to come with M. Dubourg the next morning to Versailles. 
</p><p>
We went as desired, and after explaining many things to 
M. Gerard, had a conference with his excellency, from 
whom I had fresh assurances of the utmost freedom and 
protection in their ports and on their coasts ; that in one 
word, I might rely on whatever Mons. Beaumarchais should 
engage in the commercial way of supplies, which, indeed, 
was all I wished for, as I was on the safe side of the question, viz. on the receiving part. I communicated to his 
excellency that clause of my instructions for procuring 
arms, he. of which he asked a copy. I then informed 
him, that I considered the present as a most critical juncture of American affairs, that the campaign would undoubtedly be carried far into the winter, that supplies now shipped might arrive very seasonably in the fall to enable the 
Colonies to hold out the present campaign. He replied 
that no delay should be made by any obstruction of any 
officer, or others of the customs or police. He then told 
me that the Count Laureguais was, perhaps, a well meaning man, but not sufficiently discreet for such purposes as this ; that Mr Lee, meaning Mr Arthur Lee of London, 
had confided, he feared, too much in him, and wished me 
to caution him on the subject, and that if I would write to 
him, he would enclose it in a letter of his, by a courier 
that evening. I most readily embraced this safe way of 
corresponding, and sent a letter I had before written, with 
an addition on this subject, a copy of which is enclosed. I have thus given you the heads of my negotiation to this 
time, July 20th, and will not take up your time in making 
remarks on it, and the prospect before me, which are obvious ; but inform you of the plan I mean to pursue, in the 
execution of my commission, and hint some methods, by 
which I think I may be enabled to complete every part of 
it to your satisfaction, and the relief of my country, which 
is all my wish, and the extent of my most ambitious hopes. 
I go on the supposition of an actual unconditional independency, without which little can be effected publicly ; with 
it, almost every thing we can wish for. 
</p><p>
It is by no means probable that Europe will long remain 
in a state of peace ; the disputes between Portugal and 
Spain are on the point of producing an open rupture ; the 
former relies on England ; the latter will look to this kingdom, and has already applied to this Court on the subject. 
Nothing but the division of Poland has taken the king of 
Prussia's attention off from the injustice done him by Great 
Britain, at the close of the last war. He has now completed his part of that extraordinary work, and I am well 
informed, listens with pleasure to the dispute between the United Colonies and Great Britain. He is ambitious of 
becoming a maritime power, and is already in possession of the capital ports on the Baltic ; but without commerce it is 
impossible to effect the design, and no commerce can put 
him so directly in the road as the American. The consumption of coffee, sugar, and other West India productions, increases fast in the north of Europe, and it must be his interest, at least, to supply his own dominions. In 
case of a war in Europe, France, Spain and Prussia might be brought into one interest, and the emperor of Germany 
is too closely connected with his majesty of France to take part against them, after which Great Britain, having her 
whole force employed in America, there could be nothing 
on the one hand to prevent Spain and France from reducing Portugal to a submission to the former, nor from Prussia and France subduing and incorporating into their own dominions Hanover, and the other little mercenary electorates, which lie between them, and which for several centuries have been one principal cause of every war that has happened in Europe. 
</p><p>
With respect to Russia, it is as closely allied to Prussia, as to Great Britain, and may be expected to be master in 
the contest. Denmark and Sweden are a balance for each other, and opposites. Not to enlarge on this plan at present, 
I have only to suggest, that an application to the king of Prussia will do no harm, and may be attended with good 
and great consequences ; the Prussian ambassador at this court and at that of London may be sounded on the subject. 
But my powers and instructions arc so limited, that I can by no means take such a step ; yet when I see Great Britain exerting her whole force, and that of her allies, and courting every power in Europe to aid her, I can but wish 
she may be counteracted in her own system, and by having 
employ found for her in Europe, bring her to leave America 
in peace, and I think myself bound in duty to hint at what to 
me seems the most probable means. Dr Bancroft was full with me in this opinion. Mons. Chaumont, a very wealthy 
person, and intendant for providing clothes, &,c. he. for the French army, has offered me a credit on account of the 
Colonies, to the amount of one million of livres. which I have accepted. I ha\e in treaty another credit, which 
joined to this will purchase the articles directed in my instructions ; the credit will be until 1 May next, before which 
I hope remittances will be made. I have purchased of said M. Chaumont a quantity of saltpetre at ten sous, or five 
and one fourth per cent, in order that Captain Morgan might not return empty. 
</p><p>
As soon as I have given the orders for despatching him, and settled some other matters here, I design for Dunkirk 
to ship the Indian goods, which I hope may arrive in season for the winter supply, though I leave you to consider my 
situation with only about G or <a href='/results.php?year=7000'>7000</a> pounds to complete a contract of forty, and the bills for my private expenses being 
protested, obliged to support myself out of that capital, which I labor to do with all the economy in my power. Dr Bancroft is returned to London, and by him I wrote to Messr. Gamier, and agreed on a mode of correspondence. I think 
your remittances in armed vessels will be much the best 
method, and I have ordered Captain iNForgan's sloop to be 
armed, and should she arrive safe, recommend him, as one 
I am confident will serve the Colonies with great zeal and 
fidelity ; and I have had some experience of the goodness 
of his temper and his abilities. Mr Seymour, his mate, is 
also deserving of encouragement, as a good seaman and of 
undaunted resolution. I am not without hopes of obtaining 
liberty for the armed vessels of the United Colonies to dispose of their prizes in the ports of this kingdom, and also 
for arming and fitting out vessels of war directly from hence, 
but I will not venture on this until I see what effect my last 
memoir may have ; the substance of which is, to shew the 
danger to France and Spain, if they permit Great Britain 
to keep so enormous a force in America, and to recover the 
dominion of the Colonies ; also how fully it is in their power 
to prevent it, and by that means deprive Great Britain of 
the principal source of her wealth and force, even without 
hazarding a war of any consequence in point of danger. 
</p><p>
This memoir, which takes several sheets, I am unable to 
send you a copy of, as I have no one to assist me, and 
must make out several copies for the persons to whom they 
are to be delivered. I was directed to apply for arms and 
clothes for 25,000 men, and for 100 field pieces, with ammunition and stores in proportion. This I wished to get of the 
ministry direct, but they evaded it, and I am now in treaty 
for procuring them, through the agency of Mons. Chaumont and Mons. Beaumarchais, on a credit of eight months, 
from the time of their delivery. If I effect this, as I 
undoubtedly shall, I must rely on the remittances being 
made this fall and winter without fail, or the credit of the 
Colonies must suffer. If I can get the arms out of the 
magazines, and the field pieces here, I hope for a much longer credit ; but if we send to Sweden for the brass cannon, 
the credit will not be lengthened beyond that. Some new 
improvements have lately been made in this branch, consequently the cannon now manufactured will be preferable to 
those of former construction. Some engineers here assert, 
that iron is preferable to brass, that is, wrought iron, out of 
which the pieces may be made lighter, and to a better purpose. Considering the want of these pieces, and the plenty 
of iron in America, the experiment might, I think, be made 
without delay. I am still in hopes of procuring an admission of the article of tobacco directly from America, but 
the Farmers-General will not offer equivalent to the risk. 
</p><p>
Without intelligence from April to this time, leaves me 
quite uncertain and extremely anxious about the line of conduct now pursuing by Congress, and consequently I cannot, 
without further intelligence and instructions, proceed in 
my negotiation either with safety or honor. The resolution of Congress of the 15th of INlay, is not considered by 
the ministry as a declaration of independence, but only a 
previous step, and until this decisive step is taken, I can do 
little more to any purpose. This taken, I dare pledge myself, 
the United Colonies may obtain all the countenance and 
assistance they wish for, in the most open and public manner, and the most unlimited credit with the merchants of 
this kingdom ; I must therefore urge this measure, if not 
already taken, and that the declaration be in the most full 
and explicit terms. 
</p><p>
Merchants here would speculate deeply in the American trade, could they be insured at any premium within bounds. 
I wish to know if offices are already open, and I would suggest that if the Congress would take the insurance under 
their own direction, it would give it such a proportionably greater credit, that supplies would most certainly be obtained 
in plenty. I shall be able to procure a private interview with the Spanish Ambassador, and shall present him my 
memorial, and am in a train, which I think will carry it quite to the fountain head. 
</p><p>
Thus I have in a minute, possibly a tedious detail, mentioned every thing material on my mind, which has occurred since my arrival, and submit the whole to the wisdom 
and candor of the honorable Congress, observing that I had gone to the extent of my instructions, and though I 
have been successful beyond my expectations, yet I have but been laboring principally to set certain great wheels in 
motion, which still want something more decisive on my part, and I am confident of all that is wanting to set them so 
effectually moving, as to roll the burden and calamities of war from our doors back with aggravated ruin on its 
authors, which, if I can be the means of effecting, the world may bestow the rest of its honors on whom it pleases ; I 
shall be contented, the extent of my most ambitious hopes thus accomplished. 
</p><p>
I have now to urge a survey with respect to the contents of this letter ; more that is said in Congress transpires and 
crosses the Adantic, than you conceive of ; more than I can account for, without having uncharitable thoughts of individuals, still without fixing them on any one. I have written a short letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr Jay</a> on common affairs, \ind have enclosed 
one to Mons. Longueville, which I pray may be forwarded ; the letter is from his friends here, who have heard of his 
being a prisoner somewhere in America. M. Dubourg has continued to render me every assistance in his power ; to be 
particular would swell this letter beyond all bounds ; his 
abilities and connexions are of the first style in this kingdom, and his zeal for the cause of the United Colonies is to 
be described only by saying, that at times it is in danger of urging him beyond both ; in short, I am every way deeply 
indebted to him, personally for bringing me acquainted with agreeable persons of rank and character, and on account of 
my honored constituents, for assisting me to make such a favorable beginning and progress in my business. I know 
not how affluent he may be, but as he has really for some time devoted himself to assist in this negotiation, I am confident something honorable will be thought of for him. I have complimented him by asking of him his portrait to be 
sent to his and my friends in America, in my private capacity, mentioning our mutual friend <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>. This I 
found so agreeable, that I am confident some such distinction would be more acceptable than more lucrative rewards. 
Dr B. took pains to collect all the political publications of the last year for me and brought them with him ; he was at 
considerable expense in his journey ; I sent him from Bordeaux a bill of £30, and paid his expenses in my lodgings here ; at parting I desired him to keep an account, and when the money was expended to inform me. This gentleman is certainly capable of giving as good, if not the best 
intelligence of any man in Great Britain, as he is closely connected with the most respectable of the minority in both 
houses, not particularly obnoxious to the majority, and for his abilities, they are too well known to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a> to need 
any attempt to do them justice in a letter. I am. with the highest esteem and respect for the honorable Congress and 
their Committee of Secret Correspondence, &:c. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=sid" rel="me">SILAS DEANE</a>.
</p><p>
August 1st. — Since writing the foregoing I have been at and am of opinion, that a war between Portugal 
and Spain is at the door, and I have had an interview proposed with the ambassador of Portugal, who resides here on commercial affairs, which I have most readily embraced, and expect to see him again on Wednesday next, after 
which I will write you further ; his proposals are merely commercial, as is his station, hut something else may be investigated. 
</p><p>
August 21st. — I should have sent this off earlier, but delayed on account of hearing something more directly ; 
if I might depend on certain articles for which I was in treaty, I am now assured I may, and the whole will be ready 
to ship in all the month of October. My next labor will be to obtain a convoy, which I do not despair of, though 
it is a delicate question, and I have only sounded at a distance, yet I have no doubt of obtaining one, at least, off the 
coast of Europe, and the articles will be shipped as for die West India islands. I propose arming and well manning 
the vessels in which these articles shall be embarked, and I advise again the sending all remittances to Europe in armed 
vessels ; the probability of meeting with English merchants is well worth the risk. I hope that it will be considered 
that 100 field pieces, and arms, clothing and accoutrements, with military stores for 25,000 men, is a large affair ; and 
that although I am promised any credit, yet as they must be paid for, the sooner the better, if to be done without too great a risk. 
</p><p>
A considerable part of these articles are now on hand, and orders are issued for the others by the contractors this 
day. I prefer Bordeaux to any other port for shipping them from, but the remittances must be made to several, on which 
I will give you my opinion in my next. A number of gentlemen of rank and fortune, who have seen service, and 
have good characters, are desirous of serving the United Colonics, and have applied ; pray let me have orders on 
this subject ; if it be politic to interest this kingdom in the present contest, what way so effectual as to get into their 
debt for supplies, and employ persons of good family and 
connexions in it, in our service ? I have given encouragement, on which some are prepared to embark. One Mons. C. a celebrated engineer, who was chief in that way in the 
Turkish army, is returned, and is willing to go to America, 
but the ministry cannot as yet spare him, as certain regulations are making elsewhere ; possibly he may go out sometime in the winter ; he is a first character in his profession and otherwise. Indeed, this contention has set on foot such 
a spirit of inquiry in Europe into the state of America, that I am convinced that at the first close of this war, if, as I 
trust in God, it will close in our favor, there will be an inundation of inhabitants from this side of the globe. Many 
persons of capital fortunes have declared to me their resolution of moving to America, as soon as the liberties of 
America shall be established, and that many of their friends will accompany them.
</p><p>
August 15th. — I received from a friend at Amsterdam, a letter informing me that he would be with me on the JOtl),and 
as the vessel could not be sooner ready to sail, I determined not to risk this packet by a private hand, or by the public 
post; he is now arrived and takes charge of it in person. Were it possible, I would attempt to paint to you the heart 
rending anxiety I have suffered in this time, through a total want of intelligence ; ray arrival here, my name, my lodgings, and many other particulars have been reported to the 
British administration, on which they sent orders to the British ambassador to remonstrate in high terms, and to enforce 
their remonstrances, despatched Wedderburn from London, 
and Lord Rochford from Holland, as a person of great interest and address here to counteract me. They have been 
some time here, and the city swarms with Englishmen, and as money purchases every thing in this country, I have had 
and still have a most difficult task to avoid their machinations. 
Not a coffee-house or theatre, or other place of public diversion, but swarms with their emissaries; but knowing the ministry are my friends, I attend these places as others, but cautiously avoid saying a word on American affairs any where, except in my own hotel or those of my intimate friends. .

I have seen many more of the persons in power in this time, and had long conversations with them ; their intentions are 
good and they appear convinced but there is wanting a great and daring genius at their head, which the Count Maurepas is very far from being ; he has even imbibed a 
notion, that no assistance is necessary, as the Colonies are too powerful for Great Britain. All eyes are turned on the 
Due de Choiseul. I am convinced the moment he comes into office, an active, open, and . will be taken. I think he will be minister very soon ; meantime I 
have nothing to complain of the 
</p><p>
Indeed they will not be ahered if he takes the lead. I find M. Beauraarchais, as I before hinted, possesses the entire confidence of the ministry ; he is a man of wit and genius, and a considerable writer on comic and political subjects ; all my supplies are to come through his hands, which 
at first greatly discouraged my friends, knowing him to be a person of no interest with the merchants, but had I been as 
doubtful as they, I could not have stepped aside from the path so cordially marked out for me by those I depend on. 
M. Coudray, the engineer I before hinted at, obtained liberty last week to go for America with as many engineers as he 
should choose, and was not only assured of M. Beaumarchais being able to procure the stores he had stipulated for, but 
received orders for them, and liberty to take 200 pieces of brass cannon, lest part might be intercepted. M. Coudray 
has the character of the first engineer in the kingdom, and his manners and disposition will, I am confident, be highly 
pleasing to you, as he is a plain, modest, active, sensible man, perfectly averse to frippery and parade. My friends 
here rejoice at the acquisition, and considering the character of the man, and at whose hands I in effect received 
him, I must congratulate you on it. Several young gentlemen of fortune, whose families are nearly connected with 
the Court, are preparing to embark for America, by each of whom I shall without disguise, write you the characters they sustain here ; I have told them that merit is the 
sole object with the Congress. The bearer can give 
you some idea of the situation I am in, should this packet fail, and should he arrive with it he may explain some 
part of it. I am confident his attention to the affairs of America here will be considered by the Congress; I 
have found him in the mercantile way active and intelligent. 
Mr Carmichael is now with me from Maryland, and I find him a person of great merit. Respecting the Colonies he is recommended such by from whom be has 
received a letter but of no immediate importance ; he proposes seeing me here this month. M. Dumas has written 
me two letters from the Hague, but so timid that he has not 
ventured to sign either, though he speaks in the highest terms of the American cause. The pamphlet called Common Sense has been translated, and has a greater run, if 
possible, here than in America. A person of distinction 
writing to his noble friend in office, has these words ; — " Je 
pease comme vous, raon cher Compte, que le Common 
Sense est une excellente ouvrage, at que son auteur est un 
des plus grands legislateurs des millions d'ecrivains, que 
nous connoissions ; il n' est pas douteux, que si les Americains suivent le beau plan, que leur compatriote leur a trace, 
iis deviendront la nation la plus florissante et la plus heureuse, qui ait jamais existe."

Thus freely do men think and write in a country long since deprived of the essentials of liberty ; as I was favored 
with a sight of the letter, and permitted to make this extract, I thought it worth sending you as a key to the sentiments 
of some of the leading men. I must again remind you of 
ray situation here ; the bills designed for my use are protested, and expenses rising fast in consequence of the business on my hands, which I may on no account neglect, and a small douceur, though I have been sparing in that way, is 
sometimes of the utmost importance. The quantity of stores to be shipped will amount to a large sum, the very 
charge on them will be great, for which I am the only responsible person. Five vessels arrived from America 
with fish, which is a prohibited article, and the officers of the customs detained them, on which I was sent to and 
informed, that if those vessels came from the Congress to me, they should be permitted to unload and sell. Here 
was a difficulty indeed, for the Captain had not so much as applied to me by letter ; however, I assured die that 
there could be no doubt but they were designed for that use, and that the letters to me must have miscarried, on 
which orders were issued for unloading and storing those cargoes until further intelligence should arrive. I mention 
this case in confidence, and pray that in future some regulation may be made on this subject, and that vessels coming out may be directed to apply to uie as their agent or owner at least, and I will procure in the different ports 
houses of known reputation to transact their business. This is absolutely necessary, for by this means their articles may be admitted. Tobacco may come in this way, 
and every other article. deeply indebted ostensibly 
to M. Beaumarchais, he can obtain the liberty for the discharge of their debts. M. Coudray will see that the articles of ammunition, cannon, &:c. are provided in the best manner for the army, and will embark himself by the 1st of October.

I wrote you from Bermuda on the subject of seizing and fortifying that island. I am well informed the British 
ministry have had it in contemplation, and propose doing it next spring. Mr Warder, of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, came a few 
days since from Bordeaux to Paris, and called on me with some young gentlemen from New England ; he brought 
letters from my good friends Messrs in consequence of letters to them from Mr Alsop. I received him as I do 
all ray countrymen, with real pleasure. A gentleman present warned him against conversing with a particular person 
in Paris, to which ]Mr VV. seemed to agree, yet I am told he went directly from my hotel to that person, and informed 
him of every thing he heard mentioned, and of every person he saw visiting me ; happily he could inform nothing of 
any consequence ; for my chamber was full of a mixed company, and the conversation was general and in French 
and in English ; but this conduct of his, with his want of common complaisance in leaving the city without calling 
on me to receive any letters I might have for London, which he had promised to convey, has given me some uneasiness, and I mention the incident only as a caution 
how and what persons are recommended. The pleasure I feel in seeing one of my countrymen is such, that I may 
be in as great danger from them as others, possibly much 
more. J should be unhappy if any suspicion should operate to the prejudice of this person without cause, but ray 
friends here, who are kindly attentive to every thing that is said or done which respects America, think very strange of his conduct.

I rely on your indulgence for the length and incorrectness of this letter. I have had much on my hands, 
and no one to assist me in copying, &;c. Visits from persons to whom I cannot be denied, or visiting them, with constant applications made on various subjects, take up my mornings, and I have had only now and then an evening to write in.

I have seen the prime agent, who proposed something in the way of supplying the Colonies with military stores from 
Prussia. I shall confer further on the subject with him 
and write you. I have drawn up a memorial on the commerce of America, and its importance to Europe, and shall 
present it tomorrow to the different personages concerned. I shall send a copy, if I can get one made, by this conveyance. The debt of the Colonies in carrying on the war is a common topic for ministerial writers, but permit me to 
assure you at the close of this long letter, that the demand for land in America, if its liberties are established, will more 
than compensate the whole expense, I will in a future letter be more explicit on this important subject, but am well 
convinced of the certainty of this fact, " that the advance 
in the price of lands in America, if the Colonies are victorious, will more than reimburse the expenses of the war." 
I have nothing material to add. Never were a people more anxious for news than the people of this kingdom are for 
news from America, and surely you will put me down as one of the first in the roll of American heroes, when 
you consider my situation, plunging into very important engagements, which I can by no means avoid, yet without 
funds to support them. But I will not enlarge on this subject, and only say, that I have met with every possible 
encouragement from every person I have seen, whether in or out of office, and I believe no person in the same space 
of time ever conferred with more of both. IMy being known to be an American, and supposed to be one of the 
Congress, and in business for the United Colonies, has introduced me beyond what almost any other recommendation could have done, which I mention to convince you of 
the attention paid here to the cause of the United Colonics, and how very popular it has become in this country.

I have repeatedly seen Mr Hopkins, formerly of Maryland, now advanced to be a brigadier general in this service ; 
he talks of coming out to America ; should the Due de Choiseul, who is his friend and patron, come into the lead 
of administration, he might come out to advantage. Insurance from London to Jamaica is 20 per cent. If a few of 
our cruizers should venture on this coast they might do very well, as they would find protection in die harbors of 
this kingdom. Coming ostensibly for die purpose only of commerce or otherwise, no questions would be asked, and 
they might wait until an opportunity offered (of which they might be minutely informed,) and then strike something to 
the purpose. I give this hint to individuals, rather than to 
the honorable Congress as a body. The bearer, Mr Mc Creary, has obliged me by copying my memoir, which 
I send herewith. It has had a great run among the ministers of this and some other courts in a private way. M. 
Beaumarchais writes by this opportunity ; he has shown me 
his letter, and I have agreed in general to the contents, not 
understanding any exclusive privilege for his house. Every 
thing he says, writes, or does, is in reality the action of the 
ministry, for that a man should but a few months since confine himself from his creditors, and now on this occasion 
be able to advance half a million, is so extraordinary that 
it ceases to be a mystery. M. Coudray was not in the 
Turkish service as I was informed ; it was a gentleman 
who proposes accompanying him, but he is an officer of the 
first eminence, an adjutant general in the French service, 
and his prospects here of rising are exceeding good ; but 
he is dissatisfied with an idle life. His proposals in general 
have been, that he should be general of the artillery, and 
subject only to the orders of congress or their committee 
of war, or of their commander in chief of the army where 
he might be. In the next place, that he should rank as 
major general, and have the same wages, he. coming in as 
youngest major general for the present, and rising of course. 
Many other particulars are not yet adjusted, but considering the importance of having two hundred pieces of brass 
cannon, with every necessary article for twenty five thousand men, provided with an able and experienced general 
at the head of it, warranted by the minister of this court to 
be an able and faithful man, with a number of fine and spirited young officers in his train, and all without advancing 
one shilling, is too tempting on object for me to hesitate 
about, though I own there is a silence in my instructions. 
I therefore honestly declare, I am at your mercy in this 
case, and I have no uneasiness of mind on the occasion, 
for should I be sacrificed, it will be in that cause to which 
I have devoted my life and every in ii. The terms of M. Coudray may be thought high, but consider a person leaving a certain and permanent service and his native 
country, to go he hardly knows where, and it must be supposed he will ask at least as good terms as he could have 
in his own country, but as the terms have not been particularly considered, I must defer any thing further on this subject for the present, hourly in hopes of some explicit intelligence from the honorable Congress. You have the good 
wishes of every one here. Chevalier de Chastellier desires 
me this instant to write down his compliments to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, and with pleasure I say, the being known to be his 
friend, is one of the best recommendations a man can wish 
to have in France, and will introduce him when titles fail.
