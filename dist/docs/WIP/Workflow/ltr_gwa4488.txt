Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a>, enclosing the examination of two prisoners 
who were taken lately by one of his scouts ; from 
whence it appears the enemy in Canada have not 
made any movements in force, or preparations for an 
incursion ; and indeed this intelligence corresponds so 
exactly with that which has been received through 
other channels, that I cannot but regret having sent 
the reinforcement to the northward, at a time when 
the aid of every man was so essential to the success 
of the operations in contemplation. 
</p><p>
As it will be indispensably necessary, when we advance towards the enemy's lines, to withdraw the regular force from the northward, I have thought proper to 
advise <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> and your Excellency of it, that 
provision might be made as far as practicable to replace these troops with the men engaged for the campaign and the three years' service. At the same time 
that I express my unhappiness at being forced to the 
measure, and assure your Excellency, that nothing but 
necessity could induce me to recall the Continental 
troops, I wish it may be understood, that, when the moment of operating arrives, there is not any consideration which can persuade me to counteract the plan, that 
has been concerted between the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> 
and myself. But lest the enemy should attempt to 
take advantage of their absence, to make inroads on 
the frontier, in order to distract our attention and cause 
a diversion in favor of their most important post, I beg 
leave to recommend in the strongest terms, that every 
means in your power should be made use of to guard 
against such an event. 
</p><p>
I will also take the liberty to suggest, whether an 
additional security might not be afforded to those posts, 
which are exposed to the ravages of the enemy, by 
my sending a Continental officer to assist in rousing 
and assembling the force of the country, and to put 
himself at the head of such militia and volunteers, as 
might be drawn together on an emergency from the 
district of country called Vermont ; and whether, in that 
case, Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='co-worker'>General Stark</a> would not be a proper 
character to employ on this service, especially as he 
has already obtained a reputation from his successes 
in that quarter, and is undoubtedly a man of bravery, 
and has been accustomed to command irregular troops 
in action. It appears to me, that a popular officer in 
that situation would be extremely advantageous on 
many accounts. Whether there may be reasons of 
state against it, I know not. I have, therefore, submitted it to your consideration. I beg your opinion 
freely on the subject, and have the honor to be with 
great respect, &c. 
</p>
