SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your favor, proposing a descent 
on Long Island, although I was so unhappy as not to 
be able to meet Generals <a href="/results.php?tla=gec" rel="">Clinton</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=bel" rel="">Lincoln</a> at this 
place, as requested, I applied to the State of Rhode 
Island, and obtained their consent and orders, that 
Colonel Richmond, and such part of his battalion as 
shall not enlist on board the Continental vessels, 
should assist in the enterprise. Colonel Richmond 
will accordingly begin his march this day for New London, and bring with him the whaleboats collected 
in Massachusetts Bay and Rhode Island, to the number of between eighty and ninety, which, it is apprehended, will be of great use to the troops ordered on 
this service, especially to secure and assist their retreat, should it be attempted to be cut off. When 
Colonel Richmond arrives at New London, he has 
orders to put himself under the command of such 
General Officer as your Excellency shall appoint, 
</p><p>
I have this day conferred with Colonels McIntosh 
and Livingston on the subject. They inform me they 
are supplied with provisions and ammunition for their 
purpose, and only want such a number of water-craft, 
as, with the whaleboats divided into three parts, in 
the whole may be sufficient to transport twelve hundred men ; as he means each division to be so placed 
at the inlets to the Island, as, if cut off from one, 
he may resort to the other to make his retreat sure, 
if necessary. These I have ordered for him, and they 
will be provided and ready without delay. 
</p><p>
The number of men he proposes to set out with 
will doubtless be sufficient for his first attempts. But 
what reinforcements will be necessary soon to follow, 
to answer every purpose, your Excellency will judge. 
They may be thrown over from Stamford or Nor walk 
very soon, if placed there. I am apprehensive lest 
some difficulties may arise with regard to the command of this detachment. Colonel McIntosh is a 
superior officer to Lieutenant-Colonel Livingston ; and 
Richmond is superior in rank to both. Colonel Livingston appears to be a young gentleman of real 
spirit and abilities, and has every advantage in his 
knowledge of the Island, and the people there. The 
other gentlemen have also their merit. May not a 
difficulty arise as to the command? I hope there will not. As the gentlemen are all well disposed, I 
hope they will cooperate to the best advantage in 
the whole. What is further necessary to render their, 
operations effectual, you will please to consider and 
direct. 
</p><p>
Our naval expedition against the ships of the enemy in the Sound is still in contemplation, and preparations are making for the same as fast as we can. 
Commodore Hopkins writes me, the 5th instant, that 
the Alfred and Hampden are ready, and that the two 
new frigates there would be ready in about a week, 
if they can be manned, neither of them having more 
than half their complement at that time. Our ship 
and brig will, we trust, be ready to join them, and 
when they are equipped it is proposed that they first 
attack the two frigates that infest the coast and 
Sound, if they, or either of them, shall appear in 
their way; otherwise they will proceed directly up 
the Sound, and give the best account they can of 
the ships this side Hell Gate, which is the principal 
object. I am now informed that the two frigates and 
the Alfred are manned from Colonel Richmond's regiment, which I hope will prove true ; but, if not, am 
in hopes they may be completed by volunteers from 
Rhode Island and New London; but if they should 
still fall short of their full complement, I beg leave 
to suggest to your Excellency whether they could 
not, without inconveniency, be filled up from some 
parts of your army, unless the row-galley men, by 
the enemy's ships passing up the North River, are 
rendered useless, in which case they may be ordered 
to some proper place along the Sound, for Commodore Hopkins to take them in. 
</p><p>
I have given Commodore Hopkins the utmost assurance to give him all possible intelligence, from 
time to time, of the enemy's ships of force this side 
Hell Gate, that he may be apprised what he has to 
encounter. To that purpose I beg leave to suggest 
to your Excellency to give orders to such commanders of the guards, or posts, in sight of the enemy's 
ships, to give me intelligence of their force, situation, 
and motions, or whether and when joined by any 
other of the enemy's ships through Hell Gate. 
</p><p>
I have heard that one twenty-four gunship of the 
enemy has already passed through to them. Since 
my last from Commodore Hopkins, am informed that 
the Columbus, Captain Whipple, has arrived in port 
at Rhode Island. I have wrote to him to take her 
with him, which will make considerable addition to 
his force. Please to afford me your advice and fullest 
information. I cannot but flatter myself with strong 
hopes of advantages to be derived from this adventure of our ships, as well as the expedition to Long-island. Secrecy in both is of utmost importance. I 
am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
