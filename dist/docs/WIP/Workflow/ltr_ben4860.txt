DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am glad to find by your Favour of the 2yth past, that you 
are returned safe & well to Paris after your Expedition to the 
Sea Coast, and that you intend to publish an Ace' of your 
Experiments. Your doing it as you propose in a Letter to 
me I shall esteem a very great Honour. Nothing new in the 
Philosophic Way has occurred here since my last, in which 
I think I mentioned Dr. Priestly's Experiments whereby he 
found that growing Vegetables restore Air that has been spoilt 
by Putrefaction. Your Friends here expect your Return with some Impatience. I am, with sincere Esteem & 
Respect, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged & most obedt humble Serv. 
</p><p>
B. F.
