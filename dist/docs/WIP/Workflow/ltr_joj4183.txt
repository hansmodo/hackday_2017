Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
I received on Saturday last the interesting letter which 
you did me the favour to write on the 31st ult, together 
with the two pamphlets which you was so obliging as to 
send with it. 
</p><p>
Marks of respect to the characters of such men as Dr. 
Elliot, not only tend to console their afflicted relatives, but 
also to cherish the virtues by which they were distinguished. 
"Unhappily, there is too much reason for the common 
remark, that obituary commendations by anonymous writers 
are so frequently misapplied as to be worth very little. 
The sermon (as was proper) describes the Dr.'s character 
in general terms, but the testimony which it bears to his 
merit is ample, clear, and decided ; and considering from 
whom it comes, leaves no room for doubt or scruple 
</p><p>
As the intruded memoir, to contain a more detailed account of Dr. Elliot, is to be published in the next volume of 
Historical Collections, and consequently under the auspices 
of the society, it will be appreciated by that circumstance, 
and doubtless have also the advantage of being written in 
a manner worthy of the subject, and of such respectable 
patrons. This will be bestowing merited praise in a handsome manner. Not a few of the name, and I presume of 
the same family, of Elliot, have in this country laboured 
faithfully in promoting the best interests of man. Their 
services will be remembered in heaven, and ought not to 
be forgotten on earth. I feel for the Dr.'s family. Death 
daily severs many tender ties . . . but not for ever. 
</p><p>
I thank you very sincerely for your kind offers of service, and with pleasure reciprocate them. They prompt 
me to request the favour of you to send me the 1st volume 
of the new series, as well as the 10th volume, mentioned in 
my letter to Dr. Elliot. 
</p><p>
I am, Rev. sir, 
Your much obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
John- Jay.
