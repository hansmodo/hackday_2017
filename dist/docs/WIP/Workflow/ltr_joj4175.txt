Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the book on the Resources of Great 
Britain, which you was so obliging as to send me. It 
abounds in interesting matter, and if the facts and calculations stated in it are correct, there appears to be reason to 
conclude that Britain has less danger to apprehend from a 
long-continued war, than from a premature peace.

In the twelfth page there is an anecdote which seems to 
refer to me : if it does, it is proper for me to observe that 
your information on that head is not entirely accurate. 
While in France I was neither present at the death, nor at 
the funeral of any French philosopher. During my residence there, I do not recollect to have had more than two 
conversations with atheists about their tenets. The first 
was this : I was at a large party, of which were several of 
that description. They spoke freely and contemptuously 
of religion. I took no part in the conversation. In the 
course of it, one of them asked me if I believed in Christ ? 
I answered that I did, and that I thanked God that I did. 
</p><p>
Nothing further passed between me and them or any of them on that subject.

Some time afterward, one of my family being dangerously ill, I was advised to send for an English physician, 
who had resided many years at Paris. He was said to be 
very skilful, but, it was added, he is an atheist. I sent 
him, and had reason to think highly of his skill. For 
several weeks the patient required numerous visits, so that 
I saw the doctor often. He was a sedate, decent man. I 
frequently observed him drawing the conversation towards 
religion, and I constantly gave it another direction. He 
nevertheless, during one of his visits, very abruptly remarked, that there was no God, and he hoped the time 
would come when there would be no religion in the world. 
I very concisely remarked, that if there was no God, there 
could be no moral obligations, and 1 did not see how society 
could subsist without them. He did not hesitate to admit, 
that if there was no God, there could be no moral obligations, but insisted that they were not necessary, for that 
society would find a substitute for them in enlightened selfinterest. I soon turned the conversation to another topic, 
and he probably perceiving that his sentiments met with a 
cold reception, did not afterward resume the subject.

I am, sir,

Your obliged and obedient servant,
