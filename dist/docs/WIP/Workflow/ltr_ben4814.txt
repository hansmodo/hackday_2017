SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine of May 1st, I enclosed a copy of the petition intended to be presented to the King in Council, in behalf of the 
possessors of the lands claimed by Sir William Baker's assigns. 
I am now to acquaint you, that it was presented accordingly, 
and is referred down to the Board of Trade for their opinion. 
But, as the Board is about to adjourn for some months, we 
are advised not to press the consideration of it till they meet 
again, as they have now too little time to attend to it properly. 
Immediately on their return to business, we shall urge for 
their report. 
</p><p>
I see by the newspapers that your new Assembly is also 
dissolved. 2 I am sorry for these differences, which must be 
uncomfortable to you and all that wish the welfare of the 
province. 
</p><p>
It is now thought that a peace between the Turks and Russians is likely soon to be concluded, which gives a better 
prospect of the continuance of peace among the other powers 
of Europe ; for it seldom happens that a war, begun between 
any two of them, does not extend itself sooner or later till it 
involves the whole. Spain showed a strong inclination to 
begin with us ; but, France being not willing or ready to join 
her, she has smothered that inclination for the present. 
With great esteem, I am, Sir, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
