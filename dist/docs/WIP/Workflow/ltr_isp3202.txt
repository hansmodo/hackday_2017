DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 31st October and 1st November, I 
have been favored with, and have taken the necessary precautions that your army should be supplied 
with provisions. 
</p><p>
In my last, I informed you that General Warner's 
brigade were ordered to join you ; but, as they are 
raised only till the 1st of December, the officers and 
men think it exceeding hard that they should be 
obliged to make that long march, and their times out 
soon after they could reach you. I have, in consequence of their request, detained them here, to make 
obstructions in the river. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> and my 
self have been down to view the forts, and are both 
of opinion that a boom, thrown across at Fort Constitution, and a battery on each side the river, would 
answer a much better purpose than at Fort Montgomery; as the garrison would be reenforced by militia with more expedition, and the ground much 
more definable. 
All these circumstances considered, we have concluded to obstruct the navigation at the former place, 
and shall go about it immediately. 
</p><p>
The cannon that were left at the forts are rendered entirely useless, except six twelve-pounders at 
Fort Constitution- and these are spiked, and the 
trunnions broke off, but may be stocked, so as to 
answer the purpose tolerably well. 
</p><p>
I yesterday received a letter from Colonel Hamil 
ton, dated at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, ordering me to send forward 
one thousand more Continental troops than was pro 
posed when he was here ; this will leave me with 
about three hundred Continental troops, and no militia except those whose times are out the first of December, to cover all this distressed country. I do not 
think I can justify myself in this, without first acquainting you; and, if I then have your Excellency's 
orders, I will, with pleasure, immediately and promptly comply with them. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you that, for want of pay, 
General Poor's brigade of Continental troops have 
refused to cross the North River. The troops mutinied, the officers endeavouring to suppress them, 
and they so determined to go home, that a Captain, 
in the execution of his duty, ran a soldier through 
the body, who soon expired, but not before he shot 
the Captain through, who is since dead. I have got 
several of them in provost guard, and a general Court martial sitting for their trial. About twenty of them 
have made their escape, and gone home. I have sent 
off some light-horse, and officers of the brigade, to 
bring them back. In order to make peace, and reenforce you as soon as possible, I am endeavouring 
to borrow about one thousand or fifteen hundred 
pounds, to give them a month's pay. In the mean 
time they are curing themselves of the itch. As soon 
as this operation is over, they will march immediately. This, I acknowledge, is a bad precedent, but it 
is a worse one to keep troops ten months without pay. 
This department is absolutely in distress for money, 
and the necessary business cannot be carried on with 
out a supply is immediately sent. I am, dear General, 
very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. I have just received information from Generals Dickinson arid Parsons, that Sir Henry Clinton 
has embarked about six thousand troops as a reenforcement for General Howe ; they have not yet sailed. I shall go down to White Plains this afternoon, 
to make a show there. Possibly this will prevent 
their going so soon as they would otherwise, if at 
all.
