DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 8th, this moment came to hand. I shall forward the letter to General Stevens by express. The stores at Dobbs's Ferry I 
had just given orders to the Quartermaster to prepare wagons to remove. I think the enemy will 
meet with some difficulty in crossing the river at Dobbs's Ferry. However, it is not best to trust too much to the expected difficulties they may meet there. 
</p><p>
By the letter that will accompany this, and was to 
have gone last night by <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>Major Mifflin</a>, your Excellency will see what measures I took before your favor 
came to hand. The passing of the ships up the river 
is, to be sure, a full proof of the insufficiency of the 
obstructions in the river to stop the ships from going  up ; but that garrison employs double the number of men to invest it that we have to occupy it. 
They must keep troops at King's Bridge, to prevent 
a communication with the country; and they dare 
not leave a very small number, for fear our people 
should attack them. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I cannot help thinking the garrison is of advantage; and I cannot conceive the garrison to be in any great danger. The men can be 
brought off at any time, but the stores may not be 
so easily removed; yet I think they can be got off, 
in spite of them, if matters grow desperate. This 
post is of no importance only in conjunction with 
Mount Washington. I was over there last evening. 
The enemy seem to be disposing matters to besiege 
the place ; but Colonel Morgan thinks it will take 
them till December expires before they can carry it. 
If the enemy do not find it an object of importance, 
they will not trouble themselves about it; if they 
do, it is open proof they feel an injury from our 
possessing it. Our giving it up will open a free 
communication with the country, by the way of 
King's Bridge, that must be a great advantage to 
them and injury to us. 
If the enemy cross the river, I shall follow your 
Excellency's advice respecting the cattle and -forage. 
Those measures, however cruel in appearance, were 
ever my maxims of war, in the defence of a country ; in attacking, they would be very improper. 
</p><p>
By this express, several packets from Congress are 
forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
I shall collect our whole strength, and watch the 
motions of the enemy; and pursue such measures, 
for the future, as circumstances render necessary. 
</p><p>
As I have your Excellency's permission, I shall 
order General Stephen on as far as Aquackanock, at 
least. That is an important pass. I am fortifying it 
as fast as possible. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, 
</p><p>
And very humble servant, 
</p><p>
