DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived on Sunday, but did not take my seat in 
Congress until this morning, as I deemed it prudent 
previously to address them on the subject of their 
appointment of the 21st January, which I did by 
letter ; a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose 
for your Excellency's perusal. I believe there is a 
determination not to accept of any services I may be 
able to render them, in the line in which I have offered them. Many here affect not to see the propriety of the distinction I have drawn ; but I shall 
be satisfied if the candid and ingenuous, who are not 
always a majority, in or out of doors, shall discover 
that it is not one without a difference. 
</p><p>
The measure I proposed to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a>, the 
moment before I parted with him, I learnt, on my 
arrival, had already been decided upon as unnecessary, and I was confidentially advised that it would 
be in vain to urge it. I must, therefore, forbear, 
however strongly impressed with its importance. 
</p><p>
I do not advise you of the intelligence from Carolina, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> will probably be more full 
on the subject than I can be. The Minister has a 
letter from an agent, in which he informs the former, 
that part of the British were destined pour Ics Antilles. 
</p><p>
I believe it will be necessary for <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a> to address Congress very pointedly on the subject of 
the wagoners, as I find a disposition in many to 
have them drawn from the army. The reasons why 
they should not, if even the army would after all be 
sufficiently in force, will be obvious to him, and I 
wish him to adduce them fully, to corroborate what 
I shall deliver on the subject before his letter arrives. 
</p><p>
Our finances are completely deranged. A Committee 
of the Whole have had them under consideration, for 
some time before my arrival. They have been on 
the business to-day, without making any progress. It 
seems a paradox, that the whole should be more in 
competent than a part; but I am so perfectly persuaded of it, that I shall strive to get it referred to a few. I have thrown together my ideas on the subject. How they will be accepted I must leave to 
time; though I believe some good would result, if 
they were adopted. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to entreat your lady to accept of 
my best respects ; and to believe that I am most sincerely, with those sentiments of affection and esteem, 
which afford an ingenuous mind the most sensible of 
all satisfactions, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
