SIR, 
</p><p>
I am. particularly instructed, by Congress, to answer that part of your letter of 29th ultimo, directed to the Board of War, which relates to the filling up 
vacancies in the army. The Congress are concerned to find, that an opinion is entertained that greater confidence has been placed in, and larger powers 
given to other commanders in that respect, than to yourself. 
</p><p>
They have, in no instance, except in the late appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to the command in Canada, parted with the power of filling up vacancies. 
The great confusion and many disorders prevalent 
in that army, and its distance, induced Congress to 
lodge such a power in that General, for the limited 
space of three months, and only during his continuance in Canada. Should Congress ever empower its 
Generals to fill up the vacancies in the army, they 
know of no one in whom they would so soon repose 
a trust of such importance as in yourself; but future 
Generals may make a bad use of it. The danger 
of the precedent, not any suspicion of their present 
Commander-in-chief, prompts them to retain a power 
that, by you, Sir, might be exercised with the greatest public advantage. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose sundry resolves, 
and to request your attention to them. They relate 
principally, as you will perceive, to some new regulations with regard to Paymasters, Commissaries, and 
Quartermasters in the American army, and are intended to prevent confusion and disorder in those several departments. 
</p><p>
The Congress approve of your employing, in the service of the States, the Stockbridge Indians, if you think proper. 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolve, for taking into the pay of the States such of the seamen as may fall into our hands on board of prizes, will, I trust, be attended 
with the good effects Congress had in view when they passed it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with perfect respect and esteem, Sir, your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
N. B. Your favor of 5th instant, just come to hand, will be replied to by to-morrow's post.
