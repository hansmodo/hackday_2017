Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inclose to you an ordinance, 
that we have just passed in Congress, for establishing 
a temporary Government beyond the Ohio, as a measure preparatory to the sale of the lands. It seemed 
necessary, for the security of property among uninformed, and, perhaps, licentious people, as the greater 
part of those who go there are, that a strong-toned 
Government should exist, and the rights of property 
be clearly defined. Our next object is, to consider 
of a proposition made for the purchase of five or six 
millions of acres, in order to lessen the domestic debt. 
An object of much consequence this, since the extinguishment of this part of the public debt would not 
only relieve from a very heavy burden, but, by demolishing the ocean of public securities, we should 
stop that mischievous deluge of speculation that now 
hurts our morals, and extremely injures the public 
affairs. 
</p><p>
Our Gazettes continue to be filled with publications 
against the Spanish treaty, and for opening the Mississippi; some of them plausible, but generally weak and indecent. This seems to be contending for an 
object unattainable for many years, and probably never without war, not only with Spain, but most 
likely with the Bourbon alliance ; and, by such contention, exposing the Government of the United 
States to a dishonorable acquiescence under the captivity of its citizens and confiscation of their effects by Spain on the Mississippi, or entering prematurely 
into a destructive war in resentment for such doings ; at the same time discarding the friendship for the 
enmity of a powerful monarch, and thereby probably losing what we may possess, our share of a commerce 
that yields annually four or five millions of dollars for codfish only, independent of the flour, and many 
valuable articles of American production, used in Spain, and not interfering with their own aqueducts; 
to say nothing of a most lucrative contraband trade from the ocean and on the Mississippi, which a friend 
might wink at, but which a vigilant and powerful enemy will prevent. It seems to me that North 
America is going, if we are prudent, to be the entrepot between the East Indies and Spanish America. 
If to these we could join the settlement of a disputed boundary, and obtain a powerful guaranty therefor, 
surely such considerations greatly outweigh the farsought apprehension of an alliance of the Kentuckians 
with the British ; and especially when we consider, that a conduct which will procure the enmity of 
Spain, will probably force her into the open arms of Great Britain, much to our commercial and political 
injury. And, after all, if this navigation could be opened, and the benefits be such as are chimerically 
supposed, it must, in its consequences, depopulate and ruin the old States. 
</p><p>
The argument may shortly thus be stated ; â€” Spain will not agree to the navigation within her limits. 
Can we force it in twenty-five years ? If we cannot, why risk, for an unattainable object, the loss of valuable objects, and the incurring pernicious consequences ? 
A candid and impartial consideration of this subject. 
</p><p>
must, I think, determine the question without difficulty. But I beg your pardon, Sir, for writing so 
much on this question, which, I doubt not, but you have fully considered before. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the truest respect 
and esteem, dear Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
