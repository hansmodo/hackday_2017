Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
I have received your festina Jente letter, but wish it had 
been at least partly in cipher ; you need not be informed of 
my reasons for the wish, as by this time you must know 
that seals are, on this side of the water, rather matters of 
decoration than of use It gave me nevertheless great 
pleasure to receive that letter, it being the first from you 
that had reached me, the Lord knows when. I find you 
are industrious, and of consequence, useful ; so much the 
better for yourself, for the public, and for our friend Morris, 
whom I consider as the pillar of American credit. 
</p><p>
The king of Great Britain, by letters patent under the 
great seal, has authorized Mr. Oswald to treat with the 
commissioners of the United States of America. His first 
commission literally pursued the enabling act, and the authority it gave him was expressed in the very terms of that 
act, viz. to treat with the colonies, and with any or either 
of them, and any part of them, and with any description of 
men in them, and with any person whatsoever, of and concerning peace, &c. 
</p><p>
Had I not violated the instructions of Congress, their 
dignity would have been in the dust ; for the French minister even took pains, not only to persuade us to treat under 
that commission, but to prevent the second, by telling Fitzherbert that the first was sufficient. I told the minister that we neither could nor would treat with any nation in the 
world on any other than on an equal footing. 
</p><p>
We may and we may not have a peace this winter. 
Act as if the war would certainly continue. Keep proper 
garrisons in your strong posts ; and preserve your army 
sufficiently numerous, and well appointed, until every idea 
of hostility and surprise shall have completely vanished. 
</p><p>
I could write you a volume, but my health admits only 
of short intervals of application. 
</p><p>
Present my best wishes to Mr. and Mrs. Morris, and 
such other of our friends as may ask how we do. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Morris, 
</p><p>
Very much your friend, 
</p><p>
