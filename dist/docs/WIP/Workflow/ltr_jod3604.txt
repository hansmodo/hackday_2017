MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Senate assembled yesterday at eleven, twenty- 
five members present. The new senators were 
sworn, and a committee waited on the President, who 
immediately sent a message with the treaty, which 
was read, together with part of a volume of negotiations which accompanied it. Mr. Butler and Mr. Green arrived last night, as I hear, so that we shall 
be very full. 
</p><p>
I can form no conjecture of the time when the Sen 
ate will adjourn. The President and lady, and Miss 
Nelly, make many kind inquiries concerning you and 
Mrs. Smith, &c, &c. 
</p><p>
Your curiosity, I doubt not, is all alive. But 
mum mum mum. 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a mysterious poem for your amusement. 
</p><p>
Yours, as ever, 
</p><p>
