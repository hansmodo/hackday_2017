Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of receiving your letters of the 7th, 14th and 
17th instants. I thank you for your attention in expediting the 
exequatur of the Sieur de la Motte, and in obtaining the liberation of the American citizen, Mountflorence. Citizen Griffith 
is still detained. 
</p><p>
I receive, every day, letters which present to me the sad 
picture of what the commerce of the United States suffers at 
Bordeaux. Our vessels came on the faith of treaties. 
Some carried provisions there, others went to take as freight, 
cargoes for the French Colonies, or foreign ports. Many 
were to return loaded with corn, flour, salt provisions, and 
other eatables. All are detained there. 
</p><p>
I will not repeat to you, Sir, the various observations, which 
I have had the honor to make to you at different times on 
this subject, for the principles of justice are so evident, that it 
is useless to speak of them. I will only mention, therefore, a 
motive of a different kind, but yet deserving attention. The 
advantage, not to say the necessity, of obtaining supplies of 
provisions for France, from foreign sources, is readily acknowl 
edged. Everything then which opposes this, is prejudicial to 
the most important interests of the Republic. Now, how can 
you persuade neutral vessels to enter French ports, when it 
will be obvious to them that they incur the risk of being 
detained there ? I should ill fulfil my duty, as the representative of a friendly and allied nation, did I not point out to you 
the danger to which the provisioning of France, and especially 
the capital, is exposed. 
</p><p>
It is true, interest is the moving spring of commercial operations, but the American owners, who have made voyages for 
France, in preference to the other countries of Europe, have 
also followed the impulse of feeling, which always influences 
the judgment, and consequently the calculations. Those of 
your friends, then, who are most attached to you. are the sufferers from this detention. I leave it to your good sense, Sir, 
to infer the consequences, and flatter myself that a just indemnification for this detention, and speedy permission to depart, 
will soon efface the unpleasant impression of the losses, which 
they have sustained, and that a hundred vessels, which are in 
the port of Bordeaux, will return loaded with flour, in three 
or four months, and thwart the designs of those who wish to 
starve the city of Paris. I have the honor to be, &tc.
