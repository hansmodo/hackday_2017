MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Would not an early attempt upon the city of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, by part of the Continental troops and the 
eastern militia, be attended with great probability of 
success ? Indeed, if there was but a small prospect 
of our carrying the city, it appears to me that our collecting a respectable body of men in its vicinity 
would be attended with many good effects ; as there 
by we should probably divide the enemy, put them 
on the defensive, and oblige them to govern their 
movements by ours. We should be in a good situation to guard the North River, and even give succour to the northern parts of the State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
should Britain be so infatuated as to attempt a second 
invasion thereof. We should then receive an easy 
supply of provisions and forage. We should draw the enemy from an open champaign country to one strong 
by nature, less favorable to their designs, and more 
friendly to ours. We should have our rear open to a strong and plentiful country, filled with men friendly to the common cause. We should bring back the 
war to a climate more healthy, at least for the New 
England people, than a southern one, for which reason the militia could with greater ease be drawn 
forth. We should avoid those inconveniences, which 
necessarily arise from the want of provisions and forage, when our whole force is collected in one camp, 
and have an opportunity of fighting the enemy in 
detachments, which is of importance to us, as a considerable proportion of our men will be undisciplined. 
</p><p>
I hope these suggestions do not convey the most 
distant idea of a measure injurious to the Southern 
States. Nothing can be farther removed from my 
mind than the thought that the cause can be sup 
ported but by our most vigorous, united, and confidential exertions. We are all embarked on the same 
bottom, and shall be saved or lost together. Should 
the Union be broken, and we find ourselves sinking, 
in vain will the Southern States lay the blame of the 
sad event upon the Northern, or the Northern re 
criminate upon the Southern. 
</p><p>
I am happy to inform your Excellency, that my 
wounded leg daily acquires strength, and there is no 
present appearance of any further exfoliations. It is a little shorter than the other. However, the defect 
I hope to supply by a corked shoe, and that it will 
not be long before I shall be able to walk.* I am, 
dear General, with sentiments of regard and esteem, 
Your affectionate, humble servant,
