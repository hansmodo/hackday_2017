SIR, 
</p><p>
Finding that a story, long since propagated, under circumstances which it 
was expected would soon consign it to oblivion, (and by which I have been 
The redoubt on the right was also taken, but with less 
celerity, the Americans having the work in their possession, and being regularly formed, while their allies were 
yet engaged in removing the abatis. 
</p><p>
The fate of the enemy was now decided. The second 
parallel was continued during the night, the two redoubts 
enveloped, and a line of communication opened with the 
first before break of day. As a last effort, a sortie was 
made, towards day-light of the sixteenth, which proved unsuccessful.

Cornwallis, who knew the weakness of his defences, 
and had planned his only hopes on succour from New- York, 
resolved to make a uv^peyate attempt to cross to Gloucester, intending to escape by land to New- York. Boats were 
prepared, and a part of the troops embarked;, when a violent storm arose, which drove the boats down the rivei, r^ 
prevented the completion of his bold design. New batteries 
were now finished by the Americans; the whole works 
were mounted, and a heavy and irresistible cannonade encomplimented at the expense of Generals Washington and <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>La Fayette</a>,) hag 
of late been revived, and has acquired a degree of importance by being repeated in different publications, as well in Europe as America, it becomes a duty to 
counteract its currency and influence by an explicit disavowal. 
</p><p>
The story imports in substance, that <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>General La Fayette</a>, with the approbation or connivance of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, ordered me, as the officer who 
was to command the attack on a British redoubt, in the course of the siege of 
<a href='/results.php?city=york town' rel='city'>York Town</a>, to put to death all those of the enemy who should happen to be 
taken in the redoubt, and that through motives of humanity I forbore to execute 
the order. 
</p><p>
Positively and unequivocally I declare, that no such nor similar order, nor 
any intimation nor hint resembling it, was ever by me received, or understood 
to have been given. 
</p><p>
It is needless to enter into an explanation of some occurrences on the occasion alluded to, which may be conjectured to have given rise to the calumny. 
It is enough to say, that they were entirely disconnected with any act of either 
of the Generals who have been accused.

With esteem I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
