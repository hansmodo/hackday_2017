Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your note, in which you politely informed me that you had laid before Congress the letter, which I did 
myself the honor of writing to your Excellency a few days since. I now return you my thanks for the attention you have 
paid me, and again take the liberty to ask of you to remind Congress, that the circumstances under which I left France, 
and the situation of the affairs in Europe, which I had been principally concerned in transacting, (as I had the honor of 
mentioning to Congress) render it indispensably necessary on my part, that I return as early as possible, and that if 
my further attendance here is not necessary, I pray to be informed of it, that I may be at liberty to visit my friends, 
and prepare for my voyage ; or that if further intelligence is expected from me, I may have an early opportunity of giving it. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself your Excellency and the Congress will not judge my repeated applications improper, when the 
circumstances which attended my leaving Europe, and the situation I have been in since my arrival in America, are recollected and considered. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sic.
