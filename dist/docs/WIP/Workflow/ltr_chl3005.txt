DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now so far recovered, though far from well, that I shall set out in two days. The stripping 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> so entirely of its heavy cannon, is a most unfortunate circumstance, as the transportation 
of them from this place is a business of monstrous difficulties, expense, and labor. 
</p><p>
The Congress have, as yet, not taken the least step 
for the security of this place. The instant I leave it, 
I conclude the Provincial Congress and inhabitants in 
general will relapse into their former hysterics; the 
men-of-war and Mr. Tryon will return to their old 
station at the wharves; and the first regiments, who 
arrive from England, will take quiet possession of 
the town and Long Island. I have written letters 
till I am tired, on the subject, to the Congress, but 
have received no answer. The Committee of three, 
who were here to confer with me, agreed it was 
necessary that five thousand men should be in the 
place. They left us, and no notice has been taken 
of the affair since. Great and extensive works were 
resolved upon ; and we have scarcely sufficient numbers to mark out the ground, much less to throw 
up the works. In short, I know not what to make 
of this apathy on so important a subject. 
</p><p>
Messrs. Price, Walker, and, since them, the volunteer Melchior, are arrived from Canada. It is very 
lucky, for they can communicate all the necessary 
lights to the Congress with respect to the measures which must be taken in that country. By their accounts, nothing is so much wanted as artillerymen. 
Captain Lamb's company were all taken prisoners. I 
wish, indeed it is necessary, you should spare us a 
company from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. We cannot possibly do with 
out them. We have none here. I entreat, dear General, you would detach Captain Badlam's company. 
The Captain and I are now well acquainted, and agree 
wonderfully. The Pennsylvania and Jersey troops march for Canada; are good and strong in numbers. 
The spirit of enlisting prevails through the whole 
country. I am told, but cannot believe it, that the 
New England Delegates oppose the enlisting for a 
year. They say, by means of a shorter engagement 
the whole country would be soldiers. A curious whim 
this. Who the d 1 can fill their heads with such 
nonsense ? 1 should think a letter from you on the 
subject, to either of the Adamses, would have a good 
effect, 
</p><p>
I have this moment received yours of the 22d. It 
is a sort of reprimand for not having more exactly 
informed you of the occurrences here. I do assure 
you, General, that I have wrote fully and frequently. 
It is true, I believe, two posts have carried no letters 
from me, but I would not trouble you when I had 
nothing material to communicate. I shall not in 
trench myself behind the parade of great business, 
for my first business is to be attentive to my General. Nor shall I make a plea of the loss of Palfrey, 
since whose departure I have been obliged to write 
with my own hand every the most trifling note. But, 
in fact, though I confess I am naturally remiss, I 
have not neglected my duty in this point. I have 
suffered no safe opportunity to escape me. But 
enough of this. 
</p><p>
I shall now give you a detail of what we have 
been doing, and in what circumstances we arc. Our 
force, including the minute-men, amounts to about 
seventeen hundred men. Ward's regiment, which is 
the strongest, I have stationed on Long Island. They 
are employed in making fascines, and preparing other 
materials for constructing three redoubts, one of which will, in great measure, (in correspondence with a battery which I have sunk opposite to it in the city), 
secure the entrance of the East River. Waterbury's and Stirling's regiments are quartered in the city; the former in the upper barracks, the latter in the 
lower. Two hundred minute-men are likewise lodged in the town. Drake's regiment of minute-men, and one more company (in all about two hundred), are 
stationed at Horen's Hook, which commands the pass of Hell Gate. They are employed in throwing up a redoubt to contain three hundred men. 
</p><p>
As to the town, having few hands, and the necessary duty being hard, I have been able to effect little. I have indeed thrown down the side of the fort next 
the town, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for the use of the enemy. It was absolutely impossible to be moulded into any thing which could 
annoy their ships. I have likewise thrown a traverse, 
or barrier, across the Broadway, two hundred yards 
in the rear of the fort, with four pieces of cannon, to 
prevent the enemy lodging themselves in the remains 
of the fort, and repairing it. It is likewise my intention to barricade all the streets leading into the 
Broadway, both on the right and left, to secure us 
against being taken in reverse. Batteries are to be 
erected on the eminence behind Trinity Church, to 
keep their ships at so great a distance as not to 
injure the town. As we are surrounded by navigable 
waters, I consider inclosed works as rather dangerous. It was, therefore, my intention to throw up a 
great number of large fleches or redans at certain Distances, one behind another, so as to render it a Disputable field of battle against any force. King's 
Bridge, being a most important pass, without the 
command of which we could have no communication 
with Connecticut, I had resolved to make as strong 
as possible. 
Such were my schemes ; but as the Congress have 
not furnished the force which I was taught to expect 
from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we have not had it in our power 
to effect more than I have related. Governor Tryou 
and the Asia still continue betwixt Nutten's and Bedloe's Islands. It has pleased his Excellency, in violation of the compact he had made, to seize several 
vessels from Jersey, laden with flour. It has, in 
return, pleased my Excellency to stop all provision 
from the city, and cut off all intercourse with him, a 
measure which has thrown the Mayor, Council, and 
Tories into agonies. The propensity, or rather rage, 
for paying court to this great man, is inconceivable. 
They cannot be weaned from him. We must put 
wormwood on his paps, or they will cry to suck, as 
they are in their second childhood. 
</p><p>
Captain Smith is just returned from Fort Constitution. He gives me a most terrible account of it. 
The expense of its construction has been enormous. Its defects, both in point of situation, laying out, finishing, &c., are numerous. He has made the plan 
of another, which will command, as far as I can judge from it on paper, the river effectually. 
</p><p>
I have now related, as minutely as necessary, our situation. As I shall set out very soon, it will probably be my last from this place. I must entreat, once more, dear General, that you will spare us a 
company of artillery. Badlam seems rather averse, on proposing it. 
</p><p>
Adieu, dear Sir. Yours, with the greatest respect 
and affection, 
</p><p>
