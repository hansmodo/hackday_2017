DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have no letter of yours since my last, in which I answered all preceding ones. 
</p><p>
Last week I dined at Lord Shelburne's, and had a long 
conversation with him and Mr. Conway (there being no other 
company) on the subject of reducing American expense. 
They have it in contemplation to return the management of 
Indian affairs into the hands of the several provinces on which 
the nations border, that the colonies may bear the charge of 
treaties, &c., which they think will then be managed more 
frugally, the treasury being tired with the immense drafts of 
the superintendants, &c. I took the opportunity of urging 
it as one means of saving expense in supporting the out-posts, 
that a settlement should be made in the Illinois country; 
expatiated on the various advantages, viz. furnishing provisions cheaper to the garrisons, securing the country, retaining the trade, raising a strength there which on occasion 
of a future war, might easily be poured down the Mississippi 
upon the lower country, and into the Bay of Mexico, to be 
used against Cuba or Mexico itself. I mentioned your plan, 
its being approved by Sir William Johnson, the readiness and 
ability of the gentlemen concerned to carry the settlement 
into execution, with very little expense to the crown, &c. 
The secretaries appeared finally to be fully convinced, and 
there remained no obstacle but the Board of Trade, which 
was to be brought over privately, before the matter should be 
referred to them officially. In case of laying aside the superintendants, a provision was thought of for Sir William 
Johnson. 
</p><p>
We had a good deal of farther discourse on American 
affairs, particularly on paper money: Lord Shelburne declared himself fully convinced of the utility of taking off the 
restraint, by my answer to the Report of the Board of Trade. 
General Conway had not seen it, and desired me to send it to 
him, which I did next morning. They gave me expectation 
of a repeal next session, Lord Clare being come over: but 
they said there was some difficulty with others at the Board, 
who had signed that Report; for there was a good deal in 
what Soame Jenyns had laughingly said, when asked to concur in some measure, / have no kind of objection to it, provided we have heretofore signed nothing to the contrary. 
</p><p>
In this conversation I did not forget our main Pennsylvania business, and I think made some farther progress, 
though but little. The two secretaries seemed intent upon 
preparing business for next Parliament, which makes me 
think, that the late projects of changes are now quite over, 
and that they expect to continue in place. But whether they 
will do much or little, I cannot say. 
</p><p>
Du Guerchy, the French ambassador, is gone home, and 
Monsieur Durand is left minister plenipotentiary. He is 
extremely curious to inform himself in the affairs of America ; 
pretends to have a great esteem for me, on account of the 
abilities shown in my examination; has desired to have all 
my political writings, invited me to dine with him, was very 
inquisitive, treated me with great civility, makes me visits, 
&c. I fancy that intriguing nation would like very well to 
meddle on occasion, and blow up the coals between Britain 
and her colonies; but I hope we shall give them no opportunity. 
</p><p>
I write this in a great hurry, being setting out in an hour 
on another journey with my steady, good friend, Sir John 
Pringle. We propose to visit Paris. Durand has given me 
letters of recommendation to the Lord knows who. I am 
told I shall meet with great respect there ; but winds change, 
and perhaps it will be full as well if I do not. We shall be 
gone six weeks. I have a little private commission to transact, of which more another time. 
</p><p>
Communicate nothing of this letter but privately to our 
friend Galloway. I am your affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
