Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favors of the 2d and 5th instant have afforded 
me infinite satisfaction, as the measures you are pursuing for subsisting the army perfectly accord with my 
ideas, and are, I am certain, the only ones, which can 
secure us from distress or the constant apprehensions 
of it. Had magazines of any consequence been formed in the different States, in pursuance of the late requisitions of Congress, the disposal of the articles collected at a distance from the army would have merited 
your attention ; but so little has been done in that way, 
that I imagine you will not think the matter worthy of 
notice, when I inform you of the trilling quantities 
which remain on hand. No magazines of flour have 
been formed at any place. No salt meat was put up 
in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There had 
been, by estimate, seven or eight thousand barrels of 
meat and fish put up in Connecticut, of which between 
two and three thousand have come forward, and the remainder is, I believe, in motion. Massachusetts put up very little salt meat, and most of it has been consumed 
upon the communication by the recruits, or transported 
to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Rhode Island purchased one thousand barrels, of which about six hundred remain at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, 
and I would wish them to be still kept there for a particular purpose. I could never learn, with certainty, 
how much was put up in New Hampshire ; but I have 
directed all that was at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> to be transported 
by water to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, as I wish to form a small magazine of salt provision at that place, as I mentioned 
before, for a particular purpose. No magazines of rum 
have been formed. We have been in a manner destitute of that necessary article, and what we are now 
likely to draw from the several States will be from hand 
to mouth. From the foregoing state of facts you will 
perceive in how small a degree the requisitions of 
Congress have been complied with, and may form a 
judgment of the miserable manner in which the army 
has been subsisted. 
</p><p>
Having lately, at the request of the Board of War, 
furnished them with my opinion of the quantity of provision, which ought to be laid up at the several posts, 
they will be able, at the interview which you propose 
to have with them, to lay before you my ideas upon the 
subject of a contract for supplying the army. I beg 
you to be assured, that I never can think your correspondence tedious or troublesome. Duty as well as 
inclination will always prompt me to listen with pleasure to your observations upon the state of our public 
affairs ; and I shall think myself happy, if I can in any 
manner contribute to assist you in the arduous task 
you have undertaken. I shall very anxiously wait for 
the visit, which you promise to make me. I am, with 
very sincere respect and esteem, &c.
