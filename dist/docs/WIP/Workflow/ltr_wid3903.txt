</p><p>
SIR : In compliance with your request, I do myself the pleasure of 
committing to paper some of the principal circumstances and arguments 
relative to the late proposition of an union between South Carolina and 
Georgia. 
</p><p>
By our General Assembly, which is a pretty numerous body, it was 
unanimously resolved, that an union between the two States would tend 
effectually to promote their strength, wealth and dignity, and to secure 
their liberty, independence and safety. Commissioners were sent to 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> to treat of an union, and I was honored by being sent upon 
this business. 
</p><p>
Immediately after I arrived in <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, I found that every gentle 
man in public office, with whom I conversed, was strongly against an 
union. However, I had the pleasure to find some gentlemen of fortune, 
though not in office or convention, who heartily approved the measure. 
</p><p>
The convention was adjourned when I arrived, the beginning of January last, but upon their meeting, I notified that I had important matters to lay before them, as commissioner from South Carolina. I then 
was assured and I gave full credit to it, that I should fail in my application, but I proceeded in the discharge of my duty. 
</p><p>
Being admitted to an audience in convention, after a short introduction of what I had to say, I stated that chance had originally placed the 
present districts of South Carolina and Georgia under one government 
at Charles Town and although these districts, then forming but one, 
had been separated and placed under two governments, yet nature 
pointed out that the two should again form but one ; for their climate, 
soil, productions and interests were the same. That if they continued 
two States, we had only to recollect the history of mankind, and the nature of things to foresee that from such causes their counsels and con 
duct would clash; and, of course, jealousies, and rivalship would daily 
increase between them, to the natural prejudice of their internal improvement, common production and foreign commerce. That there 
might be dangerous disputes about boundaries and the property of the 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> River; since on these subjects many people in Carolina and 
Georgia thought very differently ; a natural and great obstruction to 
the rise of the value of property. But that on the other hand, by an 
union, all such jealousies, rivalship, prejudice, danger and obstruction 
would be removed. Improvements of every kind, especially in agriculture, inland navigation and foreign commerce would be studied and advanced with rapidity. The expenses of Government would be lessened, 
to the great ease of the people, because only one establishment of civil 
officers would be paid in the room of two. The public defence would 
be more powerful, and at a less expense under one Government than 
under two, which might be jealous of, and therefore often desirous to 
thwart each other, and at any rate certainly liable undesignedly to defeat 
each others plans, to the ruin of the people concerned. And thus, sir, 
you see many important advantages that would be common to the two 
States by an union. But there are others which would be peculiar to Georgia. 
</p><p>
By an union, the land in Georgia would rise in value, because the 
Carolina planters would be encouraged to extend their improvements 
into Georgia, and the merchants carry that trade immediately to Georgia, which otherwise must continue to be carried on as it always has 
been, and especially of late, through Carolina. The Georgia currency, 
always hitherto of inferior value to that of Carolina, (some more than 
20 per cent.,) would be put upon an equal footing with that of South 
Carolina. The town of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, in particular, and the adjacent 
lands, would be of much more importance and value, because <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> 
river would be immediately cleared, a measure that would encourage 
and occasion an immense increase of agriculture upon all the land 
within reach of its navigation, and hence an amazing increase of produce and river navigation, all of which would centre in <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. 
Thus, in a state of separation from South Carolina, <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> could 
reasonably expect, and that but by slow degrees, and at a distant day, 
only the one-half of the produce of a well-improved cultivation of the 
lands on that river, but by an union, she would in a very short time 
receive the whole of that improved cultivation and trade ; and her own 
commerce would be increased almost beyond imagination, although she 
would lose the seat of Government. Finally, I may add, that in a 
state of separation in all probability <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> will be ruined, because 
it will be our interest to preserve our trade to our own people. A town 
will rise on the Carolina side of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, which will be sure to 
preserve our half of the trade of that river, and by being wisely sup 
ported, it may draw to it the other half, also; and let it not be said? 
we cannot find a situation for a town, because it ought to be remembered, that history is full of instances of towns having been built and 
made to nourish, in situations that had been deemed impracticable for 
such purposes. Rivers and lands make wealthy towns, for these are 
natural causes; the presence and expenses of a few officers of Government are but as drops of water in the ocean; these go but a little way 
towards filling a Government post with loaded ships. The principal 
material for the building of such towns are policy and opulence. I 
thank God Carolina is known not to be in want of either. 
</p><p>
In short, sir, it was in vain I declared that Georgia should not be 
liable to pay a shilling of the public debts of South Carolina; that we 
would not be unwilling even to aid Georgia in the discharge of her 
own ; that we would condition against the taking up of great tracts of 
land south of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river; and that we were desirous of granting 
in the treaty of union, whatever they could reasonably ask for in case 
of an union. It would be the duty and interest of the inhabitants 
north of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, to promote the prosperity of those south of 
it equally the same, as it was the duty and interest of the people of 
Georgia north of Ogeechee, to aid those south of that river. Upon 
the whole, that we sought to promote the general welfare, and that we 
knew such an end would not be obtained but by an union having justice and equity for its basis. 
</p><p>
Having discoursed upon such topics about an hour, I delivered a 
written proposition as a ground-work to proceed upon, and then de 
parted. The Convention then determined (as it was said) to consider 
the subject the next day; and in the meantime, in the evening, I re 
paired to Dr. Jones, their speaker, and informed him, that as the public 
body of Georgia had heard at large the Carolina reasonings upon the 
expediency of the union, I thought it equitable that the representatives 
of Carolina should also hear at large the Georgia reasonings upon the 
same subject, in order that if objections were made, they might, by 
knowing, have an opportunity of endeavoring to obviate them and I 
desired he would in the morning take the sense of the Convention on 
this subject. He did so, and informed me that I was not to be admitted as a public person to hear their reasonings. Thus, while 1 
found they had shut my mouth, I was made sensible that they thought 
their objections would appear to be more weighty by being secured 
against the possibility of a reply. And so Mr. Button Gwinnett appeared as the champion against me, when he had taken care to deprive 
me of an opportunity of exposing the fallacy of his arguments. 
</p><p>
However, I took notes of his principal answers to what I had said; 
and in an hour after, in presence of an officer of high military rank, 
and of three or four members of the Convention, I produced those 
notes, and asked if they were just; and they agreed with me that what 
he had said, was either gross misrepresentations of what I had advanced, 
or no answer to my arguments. In the afternoon the Convention de 
livered to me a paper containing their rejection of the proffered union, 
founded, as I apprehend, upon a reason which does not exist in nature. 
For, they declared, they could not treat of an union, because of such a 
particular article (which they specified) in as they said, the Confederation of the United States, to which they had acceded. A Confederation, sir, which I do assure you never existed as a public Act of the 
General Congress, binding upon the States; but which, nevertheless, 
the Convention were taught to receive as a public Act of Congress, and 
to consider as such. The Convention were certainly innocent, but some 
individual is culpable. I received the paper, and in silence quitted the 
room. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most humble servant,
