I thank you, my dear Sir, for your kind favor of 
the 26th ultimo, which I received on the 7th instant. 
 On the dispersion of the insurgents at Worcester, 
which was dictated more by the inclemency of the 
weather, and the consideration of having effected their 
object, than by any apprehensions of coercion from 
Government, many people were of opinion that the 
disorders were at an end, and that Government would 
resume its tone. They did not reflect that the Court, 
which w^as the great object of the insurgents assembling, was adjourned ; and that, having no further 
business at that time, they went to their respective 
homes. But, as soon as any object presented, they 
again reassembled in sufficient numbers to effect it. 
This was the case at Springfield, in the county 
of Plampshire, the inferior Court of which was to 
have met on the last Tuesday of December, but was 
prevented from doing any business by a party of 
about three hundred armed men. The Government 
of Massachusetts are now convinced that all lenient 
measures, instead of correcting, rather inflame the disorders. The Executive, therefore, have determined on 
coercion ; and they will soon try this remedy, under 
the direction of our friend Lincoln. I believe, with 
you, had this measure been tried in the first instance, 
the rebellion would not have arisen to its present 
height. But it can scarcely be imagined that it 
should now fail, if the arrangements should be well 
taken on the part of Government. If it is not administered now, it may be too late in the spring or 
summer ensuing. 
You ask, what prevented the Eastern States from 
attending the September meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>. It is 
difficult to give a precise answer to this question. 
Perhaps, torpidity in New Hampshire ; faction, and 
heats about their paper money, in Rhode Island ; and 
jealousy, in Connecticut. Massachusetts had chosen 
Delegates to attend, who did not decline until very 
late ; and the finding other persons to supply their 
places was attended with delay, so that the Convention had broken up by the time the new-chosen Delegates reached <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
With respect to the Convention proposed to meet 
in May, there are different sentiments. Some suppose 
it an irregular assembly, unauthorized by the Confederation, which points out the mode by which any 
alterations shall be made. Others suppose that the 
proposed Convention would be totally inadequate to 
our situation, unless it should make an appeal to the 
people of every State, and a request to call State 
Conventions of the people, for the sole purpose of 
choosing Delegates to represent them in a General Convention of all the United States, to consider, revise, amend, or change the federal system, in such a 
manner as to them should seem meet, and to publish 
the same for general observance, without any reference to the parts, or States, for acceptance or confirmation. Were this mode practicable, it would certainly be the most summary, and, if the choice of 
Delegates was judicious in proportion to its importance, it might be the most eligible. There are 
others who are of opinion that Congress ought to 
take up the defects of the present system, point them 
out to the respective Legislatures, and recommend 
certain alterations. The recommendations of Congress 
are attended with so little effect, that any alterations 
by that means seem to be a hopeless business. Indeed, every expedient which can be proposed, conditioned on a reference back to the Legislatures, or 
State Conventions, seems to be of the same nature. 
</p><p>
Some gentlemen are apprehensive that a Convention, of the nature proposed, to meet in May next, 
might devise some expedients to brace up the present defective Confederation, so as just to serve to 
keep us together, while it would prevent those exertions for a national character, which are essential to 
our happiness ; that in this point of view, it might 
be attended with the bad effect of assisting us to 
creep on, in our present miserable condition, without 
a hope of a generous Constitution, that should at once 
shield us from the effects of faction and despotism. 
</p><p>
You will see by this sketch, my dear Sir, how 
various are the opinions of men, and how difficult it 
will be to bring them to concur in any effective Government. I am persuaded, if you were determined 
to attend the Convention, and it should be generally 
known, it would induce the Eastern States to send 
Delegates to it. I should therefore be much obliged 
for information of your decision on this subject. At 
the same time, the principles of the purest and most 
respectful friendship, induce me to say that, however 
strongly I wish for measures which would lead to 
national happiness and glory, yet I do not wish you 
to be concerned in any political operations of which 
there are such various opinions. There may, indeed, 
arise some solemn occasion, in which you may conceive it to be your duty again to exert your utmost 
talents to promote the happiness of your country. 
But this occasion must be of an unequivocal nature, 
in which the enlightened and virtuous citizens should 
generally concur. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the contrary opinions respecting 
the proposed Convention, were I to presume to give 
my own judgment, it would be in favor of the Convention; and I sincerely hope that it may he generally attended. I do not flatter myself that the 
public mind is so sufficiently informed and harmonized 
as that an effective Government would be adopted by 
the Convention, and proposed to the United States ; 
or, if this w^ere practicable, that the people of the 
several States are sufficiently prepared to receive it. 
But it seems to be highly important that some object should be held forth to the people as a remedy 
for the disorders of the body politic. Were this done 
by so respectable a set of men as would be sent to 
the Convention, even if it were not so perfect in the 
first instance as it might be afterwards, yet it would 
be a stage in the business, and men's minds would 
be excited on the subject, and towards a good Constitution. Were strong events to arise between this and the time of meeting, enforcing the 
necessity of a vigorous Government, it would be a 
preparation which might be embraced by the Convention to propose at once an efficient system! 
</p><p>
Although it may be confessed that a Convention, 
originating from the respective Legislatures, instead 
of the people themselves, is not the regular mode 
pointed out by the Confederation, yet, as our system, 
in the opinion of men of reflection, is so very defective, it may reasonably be doubted whether the constitutional mode of amendment would be adequate to 
our critical situation. If, on an examination, this 
should be found to be the case, the proposed Convention may be the best expedient that could be 
devised. Unrestrained by forms, it would be able to 
consider every proposition fully, and decide agreeably 
to the sentiments of the majority. But, in a body 
constituted as Congress is, a single member frequently 
may frustrate the opinions of seventeen eighteenths 
of the United States, assembled by representation in 
that body. There are a variety of other reasons which, 
in my mind, have the influence to induce a preference for the Convention. But the different opinions 
respecting it will probably prevent a general attendance. 
</p><p>
In my former letters, I mentioned that men of reflection and principle were tired of the imbecilities 
of the present Government ; but I did not point out 
any substitute. It would be prudent to form the plan 
of a new house, before we pull down the old one. The 
subject has not been sufficiently discussed, as yet, in 
public, to decide precisely on the form of the edifice. 
It is out of all question that the foundation must be 
of republican principles, but so modified and wrought 
together, that whatever shall be erected thereon, 
should be durable and efficient. I speak entirely of 
the Federal Government, or, which would be better, one 
Government, instead of an association of Governments. 
Were it possible to effect a General Government of 
this kind, it might be constituted of an Assembly or 
lower House, chosen for one, two, or three years ; a 
Senate, chosen for five, six, or seven years ; and the 
Executive, under the title of Governor-General, chosen 
by the Assembly and Senate, for the term of seven 
years, but liable to an impeachment of the lower 
House, and triable by the Senate. A Judicial, to be 
appointed by the Governor-General during good behaviour, but impeachable by the lower House, and triable by the Senate. The laws passed by the General Government, to be obeyed by the local Governments ; 
and, if necessary, to be enforced by a body of armed men to be kept for the purposes which should be 
designated. All national objects to be designed and 
executed by the General Government, without any 
reference to the local Governments. This rude sketch 
is considered as the Government of the least possible powers to preserve the confederated Governments. To attempt to establish less, will be to hazard 
the existence of republicanism, and to subject us 
either to a division of the European powers, or to a 
despotism arising from high-handed commotions. 
</p><p>
I have thus, my dear Sir, obeyed what seemed to be your desire, and given you the ideas which have 
presented themselves from reflection and the opinion of others. May heaven direct us to the best means for the dignity and happiness of the United States! 
</p><p>
I hinted, in the former part of this letter, that the 
Executive of Massachusetts were determined on coercion, under the auspices of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. He will 
begin his operations on the 20th instant, with a body 
of four thousand men, including six companies of artillery with field-pieces. They will be drafted from 
the militia for a certain time. If the insurgents decline meeting him in force at Worcester, the 23d 
instant, to which time the Court of Common Pleas is 
adjourned, he will proceed to Hampshire county and 
Berkshire, at which places the Courts will also sit. 
If the insurgents decline meeting him at those places, 
he will detach parties to bring in the most culpable, 
in order for a trial by law. The process of this business will be interesting, and its issue important; both 
of which I shall do myself the pleasure of informing 
you of 
</p><p>
Mrs. Knox thanks Mrs. Washington and you, with 
great sincerity, for your kind washes, and prays that 
you both may enjoy every happiness ; to which I 
say, Amen. I am, clear Sir, with the most respectful 
and unalterable affection, yours, &c.,
