Sir, 
</p><p>
I am duly honored with your Excellency's letters 
of the 4th and 12th instant. It is much to be regretted, though not to be wondered at, that steps of 
so inflammable a tendency have been taken in the 
army. Your Excellency, in my opinion, has acted 
wisely. The best way is ever, not to attempt to 
stem the torrent, but to direct it. I am happy to 
find you coincide in opinion with me on the conduct 
proper to be observed by yourself I am persuaded, 
more and more, it is that which is most consistent 
with your own reputation and the public welfare. 
</p><p>
Our affairs wear a most serious aspect, as well foreign as domestic. Before this gets to hand, your 
Excellency will probably have seen the Provisional 
Articles between Great Britain and these States. 
</p><p>
It might, at first appearance, be concluded that they 
will be the prelude to a general peace. But there 
are strong reasons to doubt the truth of such a conclusion. Obstacles may arise from different quarters; 
from the demands of Spain and Holland; from the 
hope in France of greater acquisitions in the East; 
perhaps still more probably from the insincerity and 
duplicity of Lord Shelburne, whose politics, founded 
in the peculiarity of his situation, as well as in the 
character of the man, may w^ell be suspected of insidiousness. I am really apprehensive, if peace does 
not take place, that the negotiations will tend to sow 
distrusts among the allies, and weaken the force of 
the Common League. We have, I fear, men among 
us, and men in trust, who have a hankering after 
British connection. We have others, whose confidence 
in France savors of credulity. The intrigues of the 
former, and the incautiousness of the Latter, may be 
both, though in different degrees, injurious to American interests, and make it difficult for prudent men 
to steer a proper course. 
</p><p>
There are delicate circumstances with respect to the 
late foreign transactions, which I am not at liberty to 
reveal, but which, joined to our internal weaknesses, 
disorders, follies and prejudices, make this country 
stand upon precarious ground. Some use may be 
made of these ideas, to induce moderation in the 
army. An opinion that the country does not stand 
upon a secure footing, will operate upon the patriot> 
ism of the officers against hazarding any domestic 
commotions. 
</p><p>
While I make these observations, I cannot forbear adding that, if no excesses take place, I shall not be 
sorry that ill humors have appeared. I shall not regret imjjortimit?/, if temperate, from the army. 
</p><p>
There are good intentions in the majority of Congress, but there is not sufficient wisdom or decision. There are dangerous prejudices, in the particular States, opposed to those measures which alone 
can give stability and prosperity to the Union. There 
is a fatal opposition to Continental views. Necessity 
alone can work a reform. But how produce this necessity; how apply it; how keep it within salutary 
bounds ? I fear we have been contending for a shadow. 
</p><p>
The affair of accounts I considered as having been 
put on a satisfactory footing. The particular States 
have been required to settle till the 1st of August, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>; and the Superintendent of Finance has been 
directed to take measures for settling since that period. I shall immediately see him on the subject. 
We have had eight and a half States in favor of 
a commutation of half-pay for an average of ten 
years' purchase; that is, five years full pay, instead 
of half-pay for life, which, on a calculation of annuities, is nearly an equivalent. I hope this will now 
shortly take place. We have made considerable progress in a plan, to be recommended to the several 
States, for funding all the public debts, including 
those of the army; which is certainly the only way 
to restore further credit, and enable us to continue 
the war by borrowing abroad, if it should be necessary to continue it. 
</p><p>
I omitted mentioning to your Excellency, that, from 
European intelligence, there is great reason to believe, at all events, peace or war, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will be 
vacated in the spring. It will be a pity if any domestic disturbances should change the plans of the 
British Court. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. Your Excellency mentions, that it has been 
surmised the plan in agitation was formed in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; that combinations have been talked of between the public creditors and the army ; and that 
members of Congress had encouraged the idea. This 
is partly true. I have myself urged on Congress the 
propriety of uniting the influence of the public creditors, and the army as a part of them, to prevail 
upon the States to enter into their views. I have 
expressed the same sentiments out of doors. Several 
other members have done the same. The meaning, 
however, of all this, was simply that Congress should 
adopt such a plan as would embrace the relief of all the public creditors, including the army, in order that 
the personal influence of some, the connections of 
others, and a sense of justice to the army, as well as 
the apprehension of ill consequences, might form a 
mass of influence on each State in favor of the measures of Congress. In this view, as I mentioned to 
your Excellency in a former letter, I thought the 
discontents of the army might he turned to a good 
account. I am still of opinion, that their earnest, 
but respectful applications for redress will have a 
good effect. 
</p><p>
As to any combination of force, it could only be 
productive of the horrors of a civil war, might end 
in the ruin of the country, and would certainly end 
in the ruin of the army.
