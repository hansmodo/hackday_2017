Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 13th instant I received and read with great pleasure your interesting and friendly letter of the 18th July 
last. There are several topics in it on which I should like 
to converse with you: they shall be noticed in some future 
letters. As I cannot write or read much at a time without 
fatigue, I shall confine myself at present to the one on which 
you express a wish to know my sentiments. 
</p><p>
A satisfactory answer to the question of " reform," can 
only result from a judicious selection and combination of 
the reasons and circumstances which bear relation to it. 
Of many of these my information is so imperfect, as that 
it would be rash to form a decided judgment. I have not 
sufficient data whereon to calculate, whether so much good 
may reasonably be expected from such a measure, as would 
justify the risk of inconveniences, to which every important 
innovation is more or less liable. 
</p><p>
The principles of the English constitution appear to 
require that the whole number of representatives should 
be fairly apportioned among the whole number of electors. 
But I have observed nothing in it which even implies what 
is called " universal suffrage." It is not a new remark, 
that they who own the country are the most fit persons to 
participate in the government of it. This remark, with 
certain restrictions and exceptions, has force in it ; and 
applies both to the elected and the electors, though with most 
force to the former. 
</p><p>
I do not know what the proposed plan of reform precisely 
is. J{ it be only to apportion the representatives among 
the counties, or other convenient election districts, whether 
now existing, or to be instituted, according to the number 
of their respective electors ; I should consider it as being a 
just and constitutional measure, and should adopt it, unless 
some existing or impending circumstances should render it 
unseasonable. I am the more inclined to this opinion by 
the present state of your aristocracy, which is such, as not 
unnaturally to excite a jealousy that it will obtain, if it has 
not already obtained, an undue ascendency. The French 
revolution has so discredited democracy, and it has so few 
influential advocates in Europe, that I doubt its giving you 
much more trouble. On the contrary, there seems to be a danger of its depreciating too much. Without a portion 
of it there can be no free government. What that portion 
should be in England, is a question to which your constitution affords, in my opinion, the best answer. To pi -serve 
balances in times like these, isdifficult; mere palliative -pro 
hac vice expedients seldom produce durable good. They 
so frequently violate sound established principles, as rarely 
to prevent more trouble than they cause. The fluctuation 
ot human affairs occasionally imposes changes on nations 
as well as on individuals, to which they find it necessary 
and prudent to accommodate, by corresponding or by countervailing changes. These, if made considerately and in 
season, generally conduce to security and order. Whether, 
during the rage and range of democracy, your aristocracy 
received greater accessions of strength than the public 
safety and sound policy required, I do not know. There 
seems, however, to be reason to apprehend, that when 
things return to a calm and settled course, the commons 
will feel the influence of the lords out of doors, and consequently within doors, in a greater degree than the constitution allows. If so, that consideration becomes an argument 
in favour of the proposed " reform." 
</p><p>
I will add an observation which strikes me as having: 
weight. Some of the boroughs appear to have degenerated 
into a mere mean, by which opulent political leaders supply 
themselves with able and active partisans and advocates. 
These, although received in parliament as members, are in 
fact and truth the representatives of their employers, and 
not of the nation. It must be admitted that these employers have often taken into their service men of great talents, 
and in many instances, of great worth. Wise and good 
borough-holders, like wise and good kings, doubtless wish 
and endeavour to make the best appointments ; but ought 
either borough-holders or kings to appoint representatives 
for the nation ? 
With great esteem and regard, and the best wishes for 
the prosperity of yourself and family, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and faithful servant,
