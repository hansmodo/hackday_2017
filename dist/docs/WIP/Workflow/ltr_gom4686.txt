Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In mine of the sixteenth, I omitted to mention the fall of 
the Brissotin party and of the Duke of Orleans ; but it was a 
thing so much of course, that you had, doubtless, anticipated it. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you that silver was nearly at par. In 
effect, it is now under par. Crowns, I am told, sell at two 
per cent discount, and bullion, I know, is at fifty two livres 
per marc, and the price for many years preceding the revolution was fifty-four, as I am told. For some days past there 
has been no foreign exchange. There are no buyers, be 
cause the person, who takes a bill, is considered as suspect 
ed, and persons suspected are put in prison, and persons in 
prison are so numerous, that none can get out, because, in the 
multitude of applications, there is no time to examine any 
particular complaint. 
</p><p>
You will form some more accurate idea of this situation, 
when I tell you that a young American by the name of Griffith, having lost at Havre my certificate that he was an 
American citizen, was taken up. I declined interfering for 
him at first, because I suspected that the certificate had been 
made use of for some sinister purpose ; but, when all matters 
were cleared up to my satisfaction, I applied to the Minister, 
and he to the Committee of Safety. I have repeated my applications for a month past, and, he has repeated his, and as 
yet nothing satisfactory is done, although I have no doubt of 
the disposition of government to give us satisfaction. 
</p><p>
They deliberate at present on the means of bringing their 
system a little more into form, and the Minister tells me that, 
as soon as that is effected, I shall have less frequent reason to 
complain, and more speedy and effectual redress. I hope 
this may be the case, for at present it is terrible. 
</p><p>
We have, as Mr Fenwick informs me, ninety-two sail of 
vessels at Bordeaux. I have formerly mentioned to you the 
embargo laid in that port. It has, at length, produced the 
greatest distress. The crews have consumed their provisions. 
The merchants will be saddled with heavy loss and cost. I 
have made reiterated applications ; but the situation of that 
city has prevented the Comite de Salut Public from a direct 
interference. The Commissaires have persisted in their 
measure of shutting the port. They promise Mr Fenwick 
redress from day to day. The Minister cannot promise 
redress to me, but he promises to try for it, and I believe he 
does try ; but I am sure that it is as yet without effect. 

In my last conference on the subject, two days ago, after 
having advanced the various reasons arising from the justice 
of the demand, and after stating to him the very great hard 
ship of the case, I hinted the extreme bad policy which 
would deter any American vessel from coming to France, 
unless reparation were made. I know not, as yet, the effect ; 
but I am sure that all commerce between this country and 
America must soon terminate, unless a more regular and 
orderly system shall soon take place. I expect that all the 
ports of America will be filled with complaints. And, from 
what Mr Fenwick writes, I suppose the public servants will 
be criminated, because France is without a regular government. This, to be sure, is not very just, but it is very natural. A choleric man beats the post, which he has struck his head against. I am, &c.
