My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your three letters, one of the 1'st 
inst., and two of the 3 d , with the very seasonable sup 
ply of buff cloth, which, that I may not disgrace the 
relation in which I stand to the president of Congress, 
and the Commander in chief of the armies of the 
United States, by an unworthy appearance, shall be 
immediately converted to proper use. My obligation 
is the greater, as my want was more pressing, and I 
entreat your acceptance of due thanks. The necessity 
of the case can only plead my excuse for intruding 
such minutious objects on a mind filled with the interests of a great empire. 
</p><p>
The method which you allude to, of procuring the 
necessary article in question, has been clandestinely 
practiced by many. The policy of continuing the law 
which prohibits this commerce, is disputed. It does 
not appear to me, that a connivance at it on the part 
of the states would importantly injure our own manufactories, or encourage those of Great Britain. How 
far it might be pernicious in draining us of specie, and 
in reducing the present slender resources which we 
have for supporting our prisoners among the enemy, 
I cannot pronounce. The greatest objection I think 
is, that our country people and soldiers would be 
debauched by this interest, It is probable that one of 
the principal marts of the continent has capitally suffered by tiro, and that we shall more than ever find it 
expedient to relax the vigor of our first resolutions 
against all kind of commerce with the enemy. 
</p><p>
The naval expedition in which some of our brave 
landsmen, you say, have embarked, will, I hope, be 
crowned with deserved success. 
</p><p>
The accounts which you have heard of repeated 
successes of the enemy's parties have probably been 
exaggerated. The major superintending the Taylors, 
from the best accounts I have been able to gather 
from two of our soldiers, who made their escape, and 
concurrent circumstances, appears to me inexcusable. 
lie had sufficient warning to have admitted of his 
posting his guard advantageously, and repelling the 
enemy with loss, in case they should have hazarded 
an assault. 
</p><p>
The number of men unfit for duty by reason of their 
nakedness, the number sick in hospitals, and present 
under innoculation, certainly emaciate the effective 
column in our returns. 
</p><p>
Similar causes, added to the severity of the season, 
have prevented our completing the works of the camp, 
in such a manner as would have been indispensably 
necessary if we had been engaged with a more alert 
and enterprising antagonist. 
</p><p>
The repeated cavils of some general officers have 
driven the engineer in his own defence to substitute 
lines to redoubts in fortifying the camp, whereby 
the labor of the soldier was greatly augmented, and 
</p><p>
the extent to be mann'd is considerably increased. 
The position which we at present occupy, is not that 
which was at first judiciously chosen. The bridge 
over Schuylkil which was intended to be one of the 
avenues of retreat is so placed, that it is impossible to 
cover it by any work. Perhaps in case of attack, we 
shall be obliged to abandon both that and our huts, 
to the destroying hand of the enemy, and if we fight 
at all, must make a stand in the rear of both. 
</p><p>
It is a very bad principle, to trust to the usual sluggishness and inactivity of the enemy. But when I 
reflect upon the great indulgence of Gen'l Howe, I draw 
some consolation from hoping that he will not do violence to his nature by any extraordinary exertions at 
the present moment, but postpone his visit till we be 
better prepared for receiving him. These truths are 
deposited in the breasts of a few, and must be deplored 
in silence. But every prudent method and General argument should be used to stimulate the different 
states to the immediate completion of their regiments. 
</p><p>
I am truly sensible of your kindness 011 the subject 
of my black battalion. Nothing would tempt me to 
quit my present station, but a prospect of being more 
useful in another. 
</p><p>
The ambition of serving my country, and desire of 
gaining fame, leads me to wish for the command of 
men. I would cherish those dear, ragged Continentals, 
whose patience will be the admiration of future ages, 
and glory in bleeding with them. 
It gives me the most serious concern, to find that you have any thoughts of retiring from Congress. 
That body collectively it is a deplorable truth has 
fallen into disrepute. Firm and disinterested patriots 
are more than ever wanted. I entreat you in the 
name of your country, not to lessen their numbers at 
this critical epoch of our affairs. I think the sum 
proposed might be very usefully disposed. The 
effect greatly depends upon a judicious distribution, 
and would be more certain if the sum could be augmented by other contributions. A gift of this kind, 
deposited in the hands of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Franklin</a>, at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, might prove a blessing to the sick and naked. 
Blankets, and a few of the little articles which comfort 
disordered nature, would lessen the horrors of a goal, 
and keep our unhappy soldiers from despair. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a> has had the fortune to please 
uncommonly, for a stranger, at first sight. 
</p><p>
All the Gen'l officers who have seen him, are prepossessed in his favor, and conceive highly of his abilities. 
I must tell you tho , by the bye, that Congress has mistaken his rank in Prussia. He was there lieutenant general quarticr maitre, which in good English 
is deputy quarter master general. He had never any higher rank in the Prussian service, than that of 
colonel. But he was lieutenant general of the Margrave de Baden's troops, after he had retired from the 
Prussian army in disgust, As far as my line can reach, I conceive the baron to be profound in the military science. 
</p><p>
The General seems to have a very good opinion of 
him, and thinks he might be usefully employed 
in the office of inspector general, but I fancy is 
cautious of recommending it to Congress, as he might 
appear implacably to pursue a certain person to whom 
Congress gave that post. Now it is a doubt with me 
whether the gentleman in question was not virtually 
removed from the inspectorship by being ordered on 
the Canadian expedition. In that case, the difficulty 
would be obviated. The baron's own desire is to 
have for the present the rank and pay of major Gen'l ; 
not to have any actual command, until he is better 
known, and shall be better qualified by a knowledge 
of our language, and the genius and manners of the 
people. Then, if any stroke is to be struck, his ambition prompts him to solicit a command. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington has received the miniature, and 
wishes to know whether Major Rogers is still at 
York. The defects of this portrait I think are, that 
the visage is too long, and old age is too strongly 
marked in it. He is not altogether mistaken, w T ith 
respect to the languor of the general's eye ; for altho 
his countenance when affected either by joy or anger, 
is full of expression, yet when the muscles are in a 
state of repose, his eye certainly wants animation. 
My proficiency in this kind of drawing never went 
beyond sketching a profile. I never attempted to 
paint a miniature likeness of a full face. There is a 
miniature painter in camp who has made two or 
three successful attempts to produce the general's 
likeness. 
</p><p>
The indulgence granted to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>, I have 
no doubt will operate rather to our advantage, than 
otherwise. He is too much a man of the world not 
to have a convenient pliability, and therefore I am 
not surprised that in his present circumstances, he 
has paid homage to Congress. 
</p><p>
Since the 1st of the month, we have had twenty-two 
deserters from the enemy, exclusive of those of our 
own soldiers, who, during their confinement, had 
been driven by unremitting inhumanity to enter their 
service, and embraced the first opportunity to escape. 
Of the latter class, so many have given them the slip 
immediately on receiving their new clothes, that Gen'l Howe under pretence of paying the passages of our 
deserters to England, for their greater security against 
our pursuit, distributes them on board the fleet, where 
they will either be made seamen, or kept for the ser 
vice of the islands, E. Indies, etc. By the accounts of 
deserters yesterday, it appears that the enemy have 
embarked, or are preparing to embark, a considerable 
number of invalids. The intelligence given by the 
majority of them confirms our ideas of the weak 
state of their regiments, and from Mr. Howe's characteristic caution almost ensures us against an attack 
before his reinforcements arrive. 
</p><p>
We have the pleasure to be informed that the 
recruiting service goes extremely well on in the Delaware state, and there are good prospects in the eastern 
states of completing the regiments speedily. You will 
be informed of Capt. Barry's success with two or three 
armed boats on the Delaware. Two transports loaded 
with forage, one of them mounting six four pounders 
attended by a schooner, mounting eight four pounders 
and four howitzers, fell into his hands, by his gallantry and address. The schooner had 011 board a 
lieutenant of engineers and company of artificers, 
some valuable intrenching tools, officers baggage and 
wines, delicacies destined for Gen'l Howe's table, etc. 
Capt Barry was obliged to destroy the ships, and set 
out on a new cruise with the schooner. A large fleet 
of the enemy's vessels were coming up the river. 
Barry mantained an obstinate light ; his men once 
leaped into the boat and were preparing to desert him ; 
his presence of mind and singular address recovered 
them. He renewed the combat, but surrounded and 
overpowered, he was obliged to run his schooner on 
shore, where he saved the camion and every thing 
valuable, and rendered the schooner useless. You 
may see that I write in great haste, which I am the 
more sorry for, as it would give me pleasure to dwell 
upon the praises due to Capt. Barry. Among other 
tinners taken on board the schooner are a number of German letters and papers relative to the foreign regiments in British service, from whence we hope to 
gain some useful intelligence. Gen'l Knyphausen's 
order of the Lion'd or is likewise taken, but will be sent unto him. 
</p><p>
I am ever your most affectionate 
</p><p>

With this you will receive a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron Steuben</a>. 
</p><p>
If among the books Duplessis has given you, there is one entitled La Tactique de Ghibert, I am very anxious to read it. 
</p><p>
Likewise the work of Mesnil Durand.
