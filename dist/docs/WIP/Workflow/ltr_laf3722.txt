My DEAR General, 
</p><p>
We arrived last night at this place, and were much 
favored by the weather in our recognizing of the 
Island, where, I confess, my feelings were different 
from what I had experienced when looking at these 
forts with a hopeful eye. I saw the fatal sentry, alluded to by Colonel Gouvion, on an upper battery of 
Jeffery's Hook. I also saw a small vessel playing 
off this Hook J but quite a trifling thing, without 
guns, and but two men on board. Nothing else on 
the river but the usual guards of Spiten Devil. 
</p><p>
As you have been pleased to consult me on the 
choice of an Adjutant-General, I will repeat, here, my 
dear General, that, though I have a claim upon General Hand, in every other point of view, his zeal, 
obedience, and love of discipline, have given me a 
very good opinion of him. Colonel Smith has been 
by me wholly employed in that line, and I can assure you that he will perfectly answer your purpose. 
</p><p>
Unless, however, you were to cast your eye on a 
man who, I think, would suit better than any other 
in the world. Hamilton is, I confess, the officer whom 
I should like to see in that station. With equal advantages, his services deserve from you the preference 
to any other. His knowledge of your opinions and 
intentions on military arrangements ; his love of discipline ; the superiority he would have over all the others, 
principally when both armies shall operate together; 
and his uncommon abilities, â€” are calculated to render 
him perfectly agreeable to you. His utility would 
be increased by this preferment ; and on other points 
he could render important services. An Adjutant-General ought always to be with the Commander-inchief. Hamilton should, therefore, remain in your 
family ; and his great industry in business would render him perfectly serviceable under all circumstances. 
On every public or private account, my dear General, I would advise you to take him. 
</p><p>
I shall, on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, write you 
how those matters are going, upon which I build my 
private schemes. But I heartily wish that some account or other from Europe may enable you to act, 
this winter, on maritime operations. I hate the idea 
of being from you for so long a time ; but I think I 
ought not to stay idle. At all events I must return 
when your army takes the field. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself with the hope of meeting Mrs. 
Washington on the road. Adieu, my dear General. 
Most affectionately and respectfully yours, 
</p><p>
