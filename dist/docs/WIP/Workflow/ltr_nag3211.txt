SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had a long conversation with General 
Schuyler this morning, and have seen the powers 
and appointments upon the present business intrusted to the direction of the Committee, as well as their 
powers to act under. From all which I am fully 
of opinion, that the plan is altogether incompetent to 
the purpose and end proposed. Time will not permit 
me to enter into the detail of objections, nor perhaps 
would their force appear in the same point of light 
to another, who has had less experience in the difficulties attending the business, than I have. 
</p><p>
It is my opinion, that your Excellency ought to 
ask the decided opinion of the Committee, in writing, 
whether they think their powers are competent to 
the business expected of them. If they say not, as 
I am sure they must, then I would require of them 
the powers and the plan they conceive necessary to 
support the enterprise ; the whole of which I would 
state to Congress, supported with my own sentiments, 
as well with respect to the defects of the present 
plan, as the plan necessary for the business. Nothing, 
but some such decisive measure as this, will put the 
business on a proper footing. The measure will, at 
least, place your conduct in the fairest point of light. 
It will free the Committee from their present embarrassments, and place the labouring-oar where it ought 
to be. If you undertake the business upon the present footing, and exercise powers beyond the present 
scheme, it will be asked, why you did not ask for 
an enlargement of the Committee's powers, if you 
deemed them inadequate. And if you engage and 
fail for want of support, it will be asked, why you 
embarked in such a business, without being fully persuaded that the means were adequate to the end. In 
whatever point of view I consider the subject, I see 
the greatest propriety in your Excellency stating to 
the Committee this qusere, whether it is their opinion they can give you such support as will warrant 
your engaging in a cooperation with the French 
forces for the redemption of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have just seen <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, who says your Excellency desires my opinion upon the position the 
fleet off the Hook ought to take, upon the supposition it is a French fleet, and come with a view of 
cooperating with us. It is my opinion, if your Excellency intends to support the expedition against 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> at all events, without regard to the powers or plan laid down by Congress (if that should 
fail or appear inadequate to the end), then the fleet 
and forces ought to be immediately brought into the 
Hook, and the troops landed upon Staten Island, 
where our army ought to reenforce them at the 
same instant of time. But, if your Excellency is determined to depend upon civil government for sup 
port altogether, without any exertions of your own, 
and you think the present plan and powers of the 
Committee defective, it is my advice, to let the fleet 
and forces go into Rhode Island ; unless you should 
think it advisable to put one thousand or fifteen 
hundred men on board, and push on the fleet, without 
loss of time, to the southward. 
</p><p>
To bring the fleet into the Hook, without having taken some decisive resolution upon the line of conduct you mean to pursue, may tend to embarrass you and injure our ally. We ought carefully to 
avoid bringing our friends into distress and disgrace, 
if we cannot avail ourselves of the benefit intended us. 
</p><p>
I shall be at head-quarters in a few minutes, and 
will give your Excellency my further sentiments on 
the matter. I am, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
