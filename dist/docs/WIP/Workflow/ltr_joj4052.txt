Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 26th 
December last, which the marchioness was so kind as to 
send me yesterday. I congratulate you on your safe arrival at Cadiz, and you have my best wishes, that the same 
good fortune you have hitherto experienced, may continue 
to attend you. 
</p><p>
The state of my health making a change of air and exercise advisable, I left Paris ten days ago on an excursion 
into Normandy. Hence, I suppose, it has happened that 
I have neither heard of nor seen your letters to Dr. 
Franklin. 
</p><p>
If I am not mistaken, a copy of the American preliminaries has been sent to Spain ; and I flatter myself that Count de Montmorin will think them perfectly consistent with our 
engagements to our allies. It appears to me singular that any doubts should be entertained of American good faith ; 
for as it has been tried and remains inviolate, they cannot easily be explained on principles honourable to those who 
entertain them. America has so often repeated and reiterated her professions and assurances of regard to the treaty 
alluded to, that I hope she will not impair her dignity by making any more of them ; but leave the continued uprightness of her conduct to inspire that confidence which it 
seems she does not yet possess, although she has always merited. 
</p><p>
Our warmest acknowledgments are due to you for the zeal you manifest to serve America, at all times and in all places ; but, sir, I have little expectation that your plan of 
a Spanish loan will succeed. I confess that I am far from being anxious about it. In my opinion, America can, with no propriety, accept favours from Spain. 
</p><p>
My absence from Paris has deprived me of the means of information, and therefore I cannot at present gratify either 
your wishes or my own on that head. God knows whether or not we shall have peace. A variety of contradictory 
reports daily reach me, but they deserve little credit. It is again said, that <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is evacuated â€” that may be. 
It is also said, the enemy have left New-York ; but I adhere to my former opinion, and do not believe a word of it. Mrs. Jay writes me that Mr. Oswald is gone to London, 
but for what purpose I am ignorant. Thus, my dear sir, are we held in a state of suspense, which nothing but time 
can remove. I purpose to return next week to Paris, and shall then write to you again. Adieu. 
</p><p>
I am, with perfect respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Dear sir,' 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
