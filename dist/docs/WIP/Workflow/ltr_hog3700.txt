Sir, 
</p><p>
My public letter to Congress has surely been transmitted to your Excellency. Since then, I have been 
able to collect authentic returns of the killed, wounded, and missing of the officers of the Maryland line, 
Delaware regiment, artillerists, and those of the legion 
under Colonel Armand. They are inclosed. The militia broke so early in the day, and scattered in so 
many directions upon their retreat, that very few 
have fallen into the hands of the enemy. 
</p><p>
By the firmness and bravery of the Continental 
troops, the victory is for from bloodless on the part 
of the foe J they having upwards of five hundred 
men, with officers in proportion, killed and wounded. 
I do not think Lord Cornwallis will be able to reap 
any advantage of consequence from his victory, as 
this State seems animated to reinstate and support 
the army. Virginia, I am confident, will not be less 
patriotic. By the joint exertions of these two States, 
there is good reason to hope that, should the events 
of the campaign be prosperous to your Excellency, 
all South Carolina might be again recovered. Lord 
Cornwallis remained with his army at Camden, when 
I received the last accounts from thence. I am cantoning ours at Salisbury, Guilford, Hillsborough, and 
Cross Creek. The Marylanders and artillerists, with 
the general hospital, will be here ; the cavalry near 
Cross Creek, and the militia to the westward. This is 
absolutely necessary, as we have no magazine of provisions, and are only supplied from hand to mouth. 
Two days after the action of the 16th, fortune seemed determined to continue to distress us; for Colonel 
Sumpter, having marched near forty miles up the 
river Wateree, halted with the wagons and prisoners 
he had taken the 15th; by some indiscretion the 
men were surprised, cut off from their arms, the 
whole routed, and the wagons and prisoners retaken. 
</p><p>
What encouragement the numerous disaffected in 
this State may give Lord Cornwallis to advance further into the country, I cannot yet say. Colonel 
Sumpter, since his surprise and defeat upon the west 
side of the Wateree, has reinstated and increased his 
corps to upwards of one thousand men. I have 
directed him to continue to harass the enemy upon 
that side. Lord Cornwallis will therefore be cautious 
how he makes any considerable movement to the 
eastward, while this corps remains in force upon his 
left flank, and the main body is, in a manner, cantoned in his front. Anxious for the public good, I 
shall continue my unwearied endeavours to stop the 
progress of the enemy, to reinstate our affairs, to recommence an offensive war, and recover all our losses 
in the Southern States. But, if being unfortunate is 
solely reason sufficient for removing me from command, I shall most cheerfully submit to the orders 
of Congress, and resign an office few Generals would 
be anxious to possess, and where the utmost skill 
and fortitude are subject to be baffled by the difficulties which must for a time surround the Chief in 
command here. That your Excellency may meet 
with no such difficulties; that your road to fame and 
fortune may be smooth and easy, is the sincere wish 
of. Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. Your commands, in respect to the Virginia 
line, shall be exactly and faithfully obeyed.
