Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 26th inst. in relation to the Presidency of the Bank, and shall cheerfully 
give as you request such views of the subject as my service in the Bank &amp; my acquaintance with the community may suggest. 
</p><p>
If the Bank were in a prosperous situation with an efficient Direction &amp; a full complement of experienced officers 
the President might, be as so many Presidents, are, a gentle 
man of high character to do the honors -of the Bank without much attention to its business. But you well know that 
the Bank of the U.S. is deficient in these respects and the 
next President must have such a decided influence over 
its management as very materially to affect its future for 
tunes. He should if possible therefore unite in his person 
these qualifications, talent for business standing with 
the gov. &amp; residence in Phil'a. 
</p><p>
1st. I say talent for business rather than what is commonly 
called a man of business for without meaning at all to 
disparage the knowledge of details which men of business 
are presumed to possess I am quite satisfied from what I 
have myself seen at the Bank that the mere men of business are by no means the most efficient in the administration. The fact is that the misfortunes of the Bank which 
grew principally out of the injudicious extension of the 
Western Branches 1 were actually occasioned by the men of 
business &amp; their errors were precisely the faults into which 
the men of business were most likely to fall. They trusted 
the Western people with money as they trusted them 
with goods and suffered themselves to be deluded by 
the visions &amp; currencies of equalizing exchanges more &amp; 
liberal habits of thinking would have easily dispelled be 
cause without intending reflections, there are not in the 
Bank such a set of officers as there should be &amp; the 
personal inspection of a President is therefore the more 
necessary. 
</p><p>
2. He should be known to, &amp; stand well with the Gov fc 
not an active partizan not even a party man but a 
man in whom the gov would confide. I am far from thinking that the gov 1 should have any direct or indirect influence 
over the Bank on the contrary the less of it which exists 
the better for both. But the gov is a great stockholder and 
a great customer and as the gov Directors cannot exercise the same degree of concert &amp; previous communication 
as the rest of the Directors stockholders do. It would be 
not unwise to consult to a certain extent the feelings of the gov* where the great interests of the Bank may depend so 
much on its countenance &amp; protection. 
3. His being a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>n tho not an essential is yet 
a desirable circumstance. The Bank has by a combination 
of circumstances become so odious in Phil'a., that it is exceedingly difficult as you well know to procure a competent 
Direction. There are certainly all the materials of an excel 
lent Board, if they would consent to rally round any one 
individual and the character of the Bank will wholly 
depend on the local Board, the Distant Directors are in 
fact from the very nature of things rather ornamental than 
useful. Now I fear that a stranger would not easily obtain 
the aid of such a Board as ought to be collected. If yet such 
is the importance of that circumstance that I am not sure 
whether the wisest plan would not be first to make a list of 
20 Directors &amp; the best names of the City &amp; then see under 
what President 15 or 1 6 of them would consent to serve 
and name him accordingly. . . .

[ This letter, although it has no definite address, is undoubtedly written to one of the directors of the Bank. The Biddle Correspondence contains a number of letters from different members of the board urging Biddle to present his views on the qualifications of a President and subtly hinted the desirability of his appearing as a candidate; and it is evidently in reply to one of these requests that the above letter was drafted. ]
