MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MY vote, I believe, will never be again given for an 
adjournment of Congress to an earlier day than that 
which is designated by the constitution, because I 
find that gentlemen cannot conveniently leave their 
plantations and professions in season to be here sooner. 
A fortnight has been already lost and we have no certainty of making a Senate on Monday. 
</p><p>
By the papers that wrap Dumouriez's Memoirs, you 
will see the drooping state of a silly and wicked rebellion. Lee, assisted by Hamilton perhaps, appears with dignity, moderation and decision. The 
triumph of Smith, Ames, and Dexter, is very exhila 
rating to the friends of peace, and equally mortifying 
to the unblushing advocates of confusion. 
</p><p>
I am more conveniently quartered than I ever was 
before, since my family left this town. 
</p><p>
My love and duty, &c., 
</p><p>
