DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 25th ultimo, I received 
information at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, that the enemy had arrived, with upwards of twenty ships, at Tybee, near the mouth of the River <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and in a harbour south of the river. The few troops at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> were 
immediately put in motion, and marched for Georgia, 
On my way, I met an express from General Howe, 
who w^as in Georgia, informing that, on the morning 
of the 29th, the enemy landed, in force, a little 
below the town of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> ; and that he, with five 
or six hundred men, occupied the heights in front of 
it ; but, upon perceiving that the enemy had turned 
his right, at some considerable distance, through a 
swamp he thought impassable, ordered a retreat, 
which he effected with part of the troops, though 
the enemy, it is said, were twenty-five hundred or 
three thousand strong. His loss, in men and officers, 
I inclose. What stores were lost, I cannot yet learn; 
among them were six field-pies. One of the field pies only was under the direction of Major-General 
Howe. 
</p><p>
The General speaks well of his officers and men ; 
and that more than they did, could not have been 
expected. lie retreated over the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. I met 
him here, where we are collecting the troops. Our whole force at this place amounts to about fourteen 
hundred. As soon as a body of men, equal to covering the State of Georgia, can be collected, we shall 
recross the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. It ought to be with a respect 
able force, for the communication with this State is 
frequently cut off by the <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> overflowing its 
banks, which renders the causeways impassable in 
boats or otherwise. There are no strong grounds in 
this country; many of the inhabitants of the State 
are unfriendly; and, besides, the country abounds 
with navigable rivers; all of which the enemy command, and through which they can, at any time, fall 
in our rear. 
</p><p>
I have met with almost every disappointment since 
I came into this department. After an encouragement to expect a force consisting of seven thousand 
men, besides the militia of South Carolina and Georgia, I have now only fourteen hundred. I was as 
sured that there were a great plenty of supplies 
and military stores ; instead of which, there were no 
field-pies, arms, tents, camp utensils, lead (and very 
little powder), intrenching tools; and, in short, hardly 
an article in the arsenal or Quartermaster-General's 
store, under the direction of the Commanding Officer in this department. This deficiency of stores did not 
arise from the neglect of the Commanding Officer, 
but the want of a military chest. I forbear; the 
subject is disagreeable ; for you to hear, will be 
painful. 
</p><p>
I expected, before now, to have had the honor of 
forwarding to your Excellency a return of the troops 
here, but the distracted state of affairs still prevents it. 
</p><p>
I have daily the unhappiness to see families of 
affluence fleeing before the enemy, reduced in a few 
hours to a state of want. 
</p><p>
My wound, which was nearly closed when I left 
camp, is opening again, and in a worse condition 
than it was seven months ago ; but I flatter myself 
nothing worse than some small exfoliations will take 
place. I am, my dear General, with the highest sentiments of esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

January Qth. Last evening I heard that the enemy were reenforced by troops from St. Augustine, 
and now amounted to four thousand ; and that Colonel Campbell, the Commander of the British forces 
in Georgia, had left <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and marched, with his 
main body, up the river, whether with a design to 
cross and attack this post or not, is uncertain.
