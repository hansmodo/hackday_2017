MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS is one of my red letter days. It is the anniversary of the signature of the declaration of an armistice between the United States and Great Britain in 
<a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>. There are several of these days in my calendar, which I recollect as they pass in review, but 
which nobody else remembers. And, indeed, it is 
no otherwise worth my while to remember them than 
to render an ejaculation of gratitude to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
for the blessing. 
</p><p>
We are wasting our time in the most insipid manner, waiting for the treaty. Nothing, of any consequence, will be done till that arrives and is mauled 
and abused, and then acquiesced in. For the antis 
must be more numerous than I believe them, and 
made of sterner stuff than I conceive, if they dare 
hazard the surrender of the posts and the payment for spoliations, by any resolution of the House 
that shall render precarious the execution of the 
treaty on our part.

I am, as you say, quite a favorite. I am to dine 
to-day again. I am heir apparent, you know, and a 
succession is soon to take place. But, whatever may 
be the wish or the judgment of the present occupant, 
the French and the demagogues intend, I presume, to 
set aside the descent. All these hints must be secrets. 
It is not a subject of conversation as yet. I have a 
pious and a philosophical resignation to the voice of 
the people in this case, which is the voice of God. 
I have no very ardent desire to be the butt of party 
malevolence. Having tasted of that cup, I find it 
bitter, nauseous, and unwholesome.

I hope Copeland will find his six loads to complete 
the meadow, and take the first opportunity to cart 
or sled the manure from the yard at home up to the 
top of Stonyfield hill. The first season that happens 
fit for ploughing, should be employed in cross ploughing the ground at home over the way. The news 
of my mother's arm growing better has given me 
great pleasure. Of the four barrels of flour I have 
shipped to you, present one of them to my mother 
from me, with my duty and affection. Tell my brother 
I hope he has seen his error, and become a better 
friend of peace and good government than he has 
been somewhat inclined to be since the promulgation 
of the treaty. 
</p><p>
I am, with affections, as ever, your 
</p><p>
