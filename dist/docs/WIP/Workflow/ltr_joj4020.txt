<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> presents his compliments to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>,

interesting.

Extract of a letter from Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, of the 15th 
March, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, to the President of Congress. 
</p><p>
" The enclosed copy of my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>, of the 4th instant, in answer to his of the 14th ult. 
from <a href='/results.php?city=middlebrook' rel='city'>Middlebrook</a>, will give Congress a true idea of my 
opinion respecting our entering Canada, and the only route 
which we can take with reasonable hopes of success. Individuals, and not the public, will be benefited by an expedition into Canada by either of the routes from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. 
That of Co-os alone is practicable, but not without the 
co-operation of the allied fleet. 
</p><p>
"<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a>'s letter of the 14th of February is 
enclosed. It being the only letter I have received from his 
excellency since December, Congress will immediately 
judge of the extent or limitation which it is proper to observe in their instructions to me."
