Sir, 
</p><p>
When characters rendered amiable by virtues and important by talents, are exposed to suspicions, and become subjects of investigation, the sensibility of individuals 
as well as the interest of the public are concerned in the 
event of the inquiry. 
</p><p>
It gives me, therefore, great pleasure to transmit to you 
an unanimous act of Congress of the 11th instant, not only 
acquitting your conduct in the transaction it relates to of 
blame, but giving it that express approbation, which patriotism in the public, and integrity in every walk of life always 
merit, and seldom fail ultimately to receive. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, 
With great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
</p><p>
President of Congress.
