Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received the copy of a declaration, made by the 
captain and crew of the American ship, the Little Cherub, 
which proves that this ship, having taken on board thirty French 
passengers, whom the Spanish government had sent away, 
conducted them to Havre ; which place he left on the third in 
stant, provided with a passport from the Executive Council, for 
going to Hamburg ; that, on the evening of the sixth, being 
then near Dunkirk, he was taken by the privateer, le Vrai 
Patriote, and the lugger, FJlrgu-s, belonging to the Republic, 
and conducted to this latter port ; that the captain and crew 
have been very ill treated, although they made no resistance ; 
and that the French having entire possession of the American 
ship, one of them seized the second mate by the collar, and 
without the slightest provocation blew his brains out. Facts 
of so serious a nature oblige me, Sir, to make complaint to 
you, and earnestly beg that a strict search may be made into 
this business, and in case they should be proved to be such as 
they were represented to me, that the murderer may be punished with death. 
</p><p>
I was much astonished, Sir, to learn, some days since, that 
the Convention had repealed, on the 28th of last month, its de 
cree of the 23d, and that consequently the provisions of the 
decree of the 9th, acknowledged to be contrary to the treaty 
by that of the 23d, were again in force. I could not believe 
it, but a copy of the decree has been sent to me. 
</p><p>
I see that the Committee of Public Safety, in conjunction 
with that of the Marine, was charged with making a definitive 
report on this affair, in the course of three days. It is very 
important to pass a definitive resolution respecting it, for the 
fate of a rich cargo is already depending on it, and we must 
expect to see contests of this kind multiply, in which cupidity on one side, and fear on the other, give rise to calumnious in 
sinuations, which lead persons of little information to believe, 
that national decisions are influenced by individual interests- 
I have the honor to be, &c.
