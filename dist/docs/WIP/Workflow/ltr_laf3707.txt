My dear General, 
</p><p>
There is no fighting here, unless you have a naval 
superiority, or an army mounted upon race-horses. 
Phillips's plan against <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> has been defeated. 
He was going towards <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and I thought it 
would be enough for me to oppose him at some principal points in this State. But now it appears I shall 
have business to transact with two armies, and this 
is rather too much. By letters from North Carolina 
I find that Lord Cornwallis, who, I had been assured, 
had sailed for <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, is advancing towards <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>. In consequence of letters from the same quarter, 
General Phillips has altered his plan, and returned to 
a place called Brandon, on the south side of James 
River, where he landed the night before last. Our 
detachment is under march towards the <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> road. 
His command of the water enabled him to land where 
1 could not reach him. The bridge at Petersburg is 
destroyed; and unless he acts with an uncommon degree of folly, he will be at <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> before we are. 
Each of these armies is more than double the superior to me. we have no boats for militia, and less 
arms. I will try to do for the best, and hope to deserve your approbation. 
</p><p>
Nothing can abstract my sight from the supplies 
and reenforcements destined to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s army, while I am going to get beaten by both armies, 
or each of them separately. The Baron remains at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, where he hurries the collection of recruits, 
and every other requisite. I have forbidden every 
department to give me any thing that may be thought 
useful to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> ; and should a battle be expected (an event which I will try to keep off), no 
consideration will prevent our sending to Carolina 
eight hundred recruits, who, I hope, may be equipped 
in a fortnight. When <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> becomes equal 
to offensive operations, this quarter will be relieved. 
I have wrote to Wayne to hasten his march ; but, unless I am very hard pushed, I shall request him to 
proceed southward. The militia has been ordered out, 
but are now unarmed, and not yet used to this business. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, from whom I have as yet no 
letters, was, on the 2Gth, before Camden, but did not 
think himself equal to the storming of the works. 
</p><p>
Most respectfully, &c.,
