Dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing of consequence has transpired since I had 
the honor last to write to you. The British fleet continue off the harbour, sometimes at anchor, at other 
times cruising. Yesterday afternoon I counted twelve 
sail, principally large ships, at anchor, and four sail 
of frigates and sloops of war, cruising ; the former 
to the east of Block Island, the latter between that 
place and Point Judith. Their intention, undoubtedly, is to block up the squadron under the command 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Ternay</a>, intercept the expected second 
division of our allies, cut ofi all supplies by water, 
and impede the operations of the campaign; and, I 
fear, without the arrival of a further naval force, they 
have laid an embargo on the squadron now here. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> arrived here the last 
evening. Universal joy was diffused throughout the 
camp. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=wih" rel="me">William Heath</a>.

P. S. The troops, which put into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, arrived here last night, by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. Inclosed is a return of the platform plank, at this place, belonging to the public. 
</p><p>
Upon the appearance of the British fleet, standing 
in for this place, I ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Greene</a>'s regiment, 
and the recruits for the Rhode Island line, who were 
under orders to march to the army, to take post at 
Howland's and Bristol Ferry, Butts's Hill, and the 
dock where our flat-bottomed boats lie. This gave 
great satisfaction to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count Rochambeau</a>, who, under 
present appearances, is very earnest to have them 
remain a few days longer, for the security of the 
ferry, flat-bottomed boats, &c. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis</a> is of the 
same opinion.
