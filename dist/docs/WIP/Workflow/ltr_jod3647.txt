MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
THIS day you promised me to begin your journey ; 
but if the weather is as disagreeable with you as it is 
here, I could not exact the fulfilment of the engagement. I fear you will have bad roads and unpleasant weather. You talk of your perplexities and say 
you must get out of them yourself. Do you think 
mine less severe, public or private ? 
</p><p>
My dear and venerable mother! alas, I feel for 
her. She can compliment her daughter yet that 
is a good sign. As to the husband, it seems to me 
that the mother and the daughter ought to think a little of the president as well as the husband. His 
cares! his anxieties ! his health ? Don t laugh. His 
comfort ; that his head may be clear and his heart 
firm, ought to be thought on more than the husband. 
Provide every thing for my aged and worthy mother. 
I hope to see her yet again before October.

You, and such petit maitres and maitresses as you, 
are forever criticising the periods and diction of such 
great men as presidents and chief justices. Do you 
think their minds are taken up with such trifles ? 
There is solid, keen, deep sense in that morsel of Ellsworth's. You ought to be punished for wishing it 
not published. 
I warrant you, I shall soon be acquitted of the crime 
of Chronicle, Argus and Aurora praise. Let it run 
its rig, however, and say nothing at present. Your 
moral reflections on worldly possessions and earthly 
comforts, your look into futurity for brighter scenes 
and fairer prospects, are wise. 
</p><p>
You can t imagine what a man of business I am. 
How many papers I read and how much I write every 
day. I fear you will effeminate me when you come. 
I have determined to send my coachman and horses 
to Paul us Hook for you. As soon as I know the day 
you will be ready to get your coach over to the hook, 
I will endeavor to contrive that the horses shall be 
ready to be harnessed at your command. You will 
find the coachman very attentive, sober, skilful and obliging. 
</p><p>
I am forever your
