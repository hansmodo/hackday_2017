Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to mention to you a young gentleman, captured by the enemy when the Buckskin 
fell into their hands in the Chesapeake Bay, and 
who was put on shore under parole, and wishes to 
be discharged from the obligation as soon as possible, 
as he conceives it restrains him not only from acting 
in the field, should the situation of his country require his services, but even from attending the hospitals for his instruction, which he is very desirous 
of doing. The person I speak of is Dr. John Lewis, 
a son of the late Mr. Charles Lewis, whose name I 
mentioned to you some years ago, while he was in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and, being refused the liberty of coming 
out, was at length obliged to return to Great Britain. 
His parole is, I think, singular, as it extends only to 
his not doing or speaking any thing to the prejudice 
of the enemy, without the clause of rendering himself when called for.

You will receive from the President a copy of a 
Report which has passed in Congress, in consequence 
of Colonel Harrison's communications. You will also 
be informed of the arrival of Provost, with a reenforcement to the enemy in the south, and of his progress since his arrival. Arnold's position at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, Provost in North Carolina, and Cornwallis in 
South Carolina, will, I fear, effectually obstruct the 
supplies from our State, or so delay them as to render Greene's situation critical. If the French ships 
from Rhode Island shall succeed in their enterprise 
in the Chesapeake, the event will be propitious, and 
produce the happiest effects. Our State will be 
thereby further aided by a supply of one thousand 
stand of arms, and some stores retaken and sent forward in one of the French frigates. The arrival of 
Provost, and the great want of arms in the Southern 
States, it must be confessed, presents a rather gloomy 
prospect ; and, under this temper of mind, you will 
receive a letter reiterating what has, I think, been 
several times intimated, a desire that you will pay 
particular attention to the Southern department. I 
wish we could but content ourselves with a communication of ficts, and any reflections upon them for 
illustration, leaving the combination and execution of 
the various operations of a campaign to those whose 
business it is to project and execute them.

Paul Jones's arrival gives us no relief in clothing 
or arms, a disappointment the more to be regretted 
as our wants increase. Yet we know not whom to 
blame. Jones will, I expect, unfold this dark, and, 
as yet, mysterious business. I presume you must 
have been informed that Virginia has receded from her former instructions to her Delegates in Congress, 
restricting the claim, on her part, to the free navigation of the Mississippi, which, if approved by Congress, 
will probably bring about an alliance with Spain, and 
an acknowledgment of our independence. No doubt 
this event, if it takes place, will give us more credit 
in Europe ; but we pay dear for it. 
</p><p>
We are about appointing the officers who are to 
be at the head of our great departments. Yesterday 
<a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, without a vote against him (though 
S. A., and his colleague. General W., declined to ballot), was chosen Financier. I cannot say he will 
accept, but have some hopes he wilL Our finances 
want a Necker to arrange and reform them. Morris 
is, I believe, the best qualified of any our country 
affords for the arduous undertaking. We shall, in a 
day or two, appoint the officers for the Foreign Affairs and the Marine. I wish we had men in these 
offices as well qualified to execute them, as Morris in 
the Treasury. Some, however, that are nominated, if 
they can be chosen, will do very well. We are under difficulties about the War Office, lest any person 
we could now put into it may not answer so well as 
the present Commissary. This may, and I expect 
will, postpone that appointment. 
</p><p>
With great esteem, I am, dear Sir, yours, &c.,
