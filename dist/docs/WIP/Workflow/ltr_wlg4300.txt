Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 25th of April, 
for which I am much obliged to you. I am sorry 
for the melancholy occasion which has induced you 
to leave <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, and for the affliction which the loss of such near relations must involve Mrs. Washington in.

The ordinance for disposing of the western territory has been under consideration ever since I wrote 
you last, and has undergone several alterations ; the 
most considerable of which is, that one half of the 
land is to be sold by sections or lots, and the other 
half by entire townships; and the dimension of each 
township is reduced to six miles. I now expect the 
ordinance will be completed in a few days, it being 
the opinion of most gentlemen that it is better to 
pass it in its present form nearly, than to delay it 
much longer, and incur the risk of losing the country altogether. As soon as it is finished, I shall do 
myself the honor to inclose you a copy ; and, though 
it will be far from being the best that could be 
made, yet I verily believe it is the best that, under 
present circumstances, can be procured. There have 
appeared so many interfering interests, most of them 
imaginary, so many ill-founded jealousies and suspicions throughout the whole, that I am only surprised the ordinance is not more exceptionable. Indeed, if 
the importunities of the public creditors, and the reluctance to pay them by taxation, either direct or 
implied, had not been so great, I am satisfied no 
land ordinance could have been procured, except under such disadvantages as would, in a great degree, 
have excluded the idea of actual settlements within 
any short length of time. This is not strange, when 
we reflect that several of the States are averse to 
new votes from that part of the Continent, and that 
some of them are now disposing of their own vacant 
lands, and of course wish to have their particular 
debts paid, and their own countries settled in the 
first instance, before there is any interference from 
any other quarter.

With respect to the different places of sale, it is 
certainly open to the objections you mention; but it 
was absolutely necessary to accede to the measure, 
before we could advance a single step. Since the receipt of your letter, I have hinted to some of the 
members the propriety of altering this part ; but find 
that the idea of allowing the citizens of each State 
an equal chance of trying the good lands at their 
own doors, was one of the strongest reasons with 
them for consenting to the ordinance. As to the individual States interfering in the sale, it is guarded 
against; and in case the Loan-Officer, who is responsible only to Congress, cannot dispose of the land in 
a limited time, it is to be returned to the Treasury 
Board. With respect to the fractional parts of townships, the ordinance has now provided for all cases 
which can occur, except with respect to the Pennsylvania line. The course of the new State from the 
Ohio will be due north ; and the dispute with Pennsylvania will be open to discussion hereafter. 
 I am sorry to observe, tliatj thronglioiit this measure, there has been a necessity for sacrificing one's 
own opinion to that of other people, for the purpose 
of getting forward. There have never been above ten 
States on the floor; and nine of these were necessary 
to concur in one sentiment, lest they should refuse 
to vote for the ordinance on its passage. The price 
is fixed at a dollar the acre, liquidated certificates ; 
that is, the land is not to be sold under that. The 
reason for establishing this sum was, that a part of 
the House "were for half a dollar, and another part for 
two dollars, and others for intermediate sums between 
the two extremes ; so that, ultimately, this was agreed 
upon as a central ground. If it is too high (which 
I am afraid is the case), it may hereafter be corrected by a resolution. I still mean to move for some 
amendments, which I think will not only advance the 
sale, but increase the facility of purchasing to foreigners; though, from present appearances, I own I have 
but little hopes of success.

After this affair is over, the requisition for the current year will be brought forward. The article of 
thirty thousand dollars, for the erection of federal 
buildings at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, I have already objected to, and 
shall continue to oppose, by every means in my power, as I look upon the measure to be fundamentally 
wrong ; and I am in hopes nine States cannot be 
found to vote for it. Should those in opposition to 
the measure be able to put off the execution for the 
present year, it is to be expected that the Southern 
States W'ill open their eyes to their true interests, 
and view this subject in a different light. What I at 
present fear is, that, failing to get this article allowed in the requisition, they will attempt to draw the 
money from Holland by a vote of seven States, inasmuch as a hundred thousand dollars were voted at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> for that purpose, although no particular fund 
was assigned. I own this matter has given me some 
disgust, as I see an intemperate ardor to carry it 
into execution before the sense of the Union is 
known; and I have no doubt that some gentlemen 
have come into Congress expressly for that purpose.

I take the liberty of introducing Mr. Sitgreaves, a 
Delegate from North Carolina, a gentleman of great 
worth, who is travelling through our own State to 
his ow^n country He will be very happy to communicate to you the news of this place. I inclose you 
the report of a Committee for altering the first paragraph of the ninth article of the Confederation, which 
embraces objects of great magnitude, and about which 
there is a great difference of sentiment. I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect, 
Your affectionate friend and most obedient servant,
