Sir,
</p><p>
By some of those unlucky incidents, which attend the passage across the Atlantic, the letter with which you honored me, dated January 16, did not reach me till the latter end of June last. 
</p><p>
There are few persons in Europe who would not be highly flattered by a correspondence with <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague'>General Washington</a> ; but, when this gratification, which, from 
the consideration of popular eminence, must be felt by every vulgar mind, is enlarged by a genuine taste for 
moral excellence, it raises the most lively sentiments of self-complacency and gratitude. 
</p><p>
When I returned from <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I had the pleasure of seeing a portrait, which 
bore the strongest resemblance to the original of any I had seen. If you favor me with another letter, you will do me great pleasure if you will inform me 
whether Mr. Pine is much advanced in his grand de-sign of portraying the capital events of the civil wars, and whether he is likely to succeed in his attempt. 
</p><p>
Give me leave. Sir, to return you our thanks for those obliging and benevolent sentiments with which your letter is replete. We present our best respects 
to Mrs. Washington ; our best compliments and good wishes to the amiable pair who have united their fortunes since our departure from America ; and our 
love to the little people, who, we sincerely hope, will both, in their different characters, afford an ample recompense for the benevolent care and culture they 
have received. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
