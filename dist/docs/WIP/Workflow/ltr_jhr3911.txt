SIR: 
</p><p>
I think it proper to acquaint you, and I desire that you will immediately make it known, throughout your regiment, that I expect to be 
met by the full number which I have called for, from it, at Wright's Bluff, with the utmost expedition, and that every defaulter may be 
assured, that my Proclamation of last month, shall most certainly be carried strictly into execution against him. As a further means of put 
ting those who may not incline to come out, in a way of rendering service to their country, which perhaps, they may do, when they have left 
their own homes, and joined the army, that I hope to have soon collected, I desire that you will cause those, who from love and zeal for 
their country, march readily to bring with them, as many as they possibly can, of such as are lukewarm, or desirous of remaining inactive, 
rather than of defending the State. I rely on your utmost exertions to procure the force required, as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
And am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhr" rel="me">J. RUTLEDGE</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. You will immediately appoint Commissioners (men of integrity and judgment,) in the district of your regiment, to make provision, 
at the public expense, for the subsistence of such families as may suffer 
by their parents or husbands being absent on militia duty.
