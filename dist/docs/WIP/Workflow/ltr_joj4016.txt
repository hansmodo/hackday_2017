Dear Kitty, 
</p><p>
A report has just reached here that the enemy have 
visited <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, and burnt your father's house. 
This, if true, is a misfortune to the family, which I hope 
they will bear with proper fortitude and dignity. Similar 
losses have been my lot : but they never have, and I hope 
never will, cost me an hour's sleep. Perseverance in doing 
what we think right, and resignation to the dispensations of 
the great Governor of the world, offer a shield against the darts of this sort of affliction, to everybody that will use 
it. Adieu. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Kitty, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and brother, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
