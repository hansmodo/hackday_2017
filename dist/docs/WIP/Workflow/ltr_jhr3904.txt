SIR: 
</p><p>
You are immediately to detach two hundred and fifty men, rank and 
file, of your regiment, properly armed and accoutred, with the necessary number of officers, the whole under the command of a field officer, 
to join and put themselves under the orders of Brig. -Gen. Williamson, to assemble and encamp the remainder of your regiment at Friday's 
Ferry, on the twenty-third day of February, inst., there to wait any further orders. 
</p><p>
Your men may be assured, that any arrears of pay shall be very soon settled and discharged; that, in future, they will receive their pay 
with more regularity than heretofore ; that, in all probability, the pay 
of privates will be augmented by an ordinance now before the Legislature, to a dollar per day, and that everything in the town shall be done 
to render their situation, on service, as comfortable as possible, and I trust that I shall be readily and cheerfully obeyed. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
