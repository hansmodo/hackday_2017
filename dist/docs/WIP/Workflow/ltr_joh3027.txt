SIR, 
</p><p>
The complaints of the want of men to the north 
ward are so great and urgent, that Congress, with a 
view of affording them some assistance, have come to 
the inclosed resolve ; by which you will perceive it 
is their desire that five hundred riflemen, under the 
command of an active officer, should be immediately 
sent into that department, to oppose the incursions of 
the Indians. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 16th instant, I was last night 
honored with, containing sundry inclosures, which shall 
be communicated to Congress to-morrow. The plan 
you have adopted and recommended for the defence 
of the River Delaware, is ordered to be carried into 
execution. As soon as Congress shall come into any 
resolves on the subjects of your several letters, the-result shall be immediately transmitted. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
