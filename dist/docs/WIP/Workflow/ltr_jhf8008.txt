My dear Sir : Your letter of February reached me in Washington some time since. I read it with much satisfaction. It was a great pleasure to find that you retained so lively a 
recollection of our intercourse in California. But my own experience is, that permanent and valuable friendships are most often formed in 
contests and struggles. If a man has good points, then they become salient, and we know each other suddenly. 
</p><p>
I had both been thinking and speaking of you latterly. The Banks balloting in the House and your movements in Kansas had naturally carried my mind back to our one hundred and 
forty odd ballots in California, and your letter came seasonably and fitly to complete the connection. We were defeated then ; but that contest was only an incident in a great struggle, 
and the victory was deferred, not lost. You have carried to another field the same principle, with courage and ability to maintain it ; and I 
make you my sincere congratulations on your success - incomplete so far, but destined in the end to triumph absolutely. 
</p><p>
I had been waiting to see what shape the Kansas question would take in congress, that I might be enabled to give you some views in relation to the probable result. Nothing yet 
has been accomplished ; but I am satisfied that in the end congress will take efficient measures to lay before the American people the exact truth concerning your affairs. Neither you nor 
I can have any doubt what verdict the people will pronounce, upon a truthful exposition. It is to be feared, from the proclamation of the 
President, that he intends to recognize the usurpation in Kansas, as the legitimate government, and that its sedition law, the test oath, and the 
means to be taken to expel its people as aliens, will all directly or indirectly be supported by the army of the United States. Your position 
will undoubtedly be difficult, but you know I have great confidence in your firmness and prudence. When the critical moment arrives, you 
must act for yourself - no man can give you counsel. A true man will always find his best counsel in that inspiration which a good cause 
never fails to give him at the instant of trial. All history teaches us that great results are ruled by a wise Providence, and we are but units in the great plan. Your action will be 
determined by events as they present themselves, and at this distance I can only say that I sympathize cordially with you; and that, as you stood by me firmly and generously when 
we were defeated by the Nullifiers in California, I have every disposition to stand by you in the same way in your battle with them in Kansas. 
</p><p>
You see that what I have been saying is more a reply to the suggestions which your condition makes to me, than any answer to your letter, which more particularly regards myself. 
The notices which you had seen of me, in connection with the Presidency, came from the partial disposition of friends, who think of me more flatteringly than I do of myself, and do 
not, therefore, call for any action from us. Repeating that I am really and sincerely gratified in the renewal of our old friendship, or rather 
in the expression of it, which I hope will not hereafter have so long an interval, I am yours, 
very truly,
