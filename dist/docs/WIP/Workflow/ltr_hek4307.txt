It is a long time, my dear Sir, since I have had 
the pleasure of addressing you, owing to my having 
been into Massachusetts and the Province of Maine, 
during the period of the last four months. I have 
received your favor, inclosing some foreign applications 
for admission into the <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>. These papers are 
placed on the files of the Society, but cannot be 
acted on until the next general meeting, to be held 
in <a href='/results.php?year=1792'>1792</a>.

In the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
and Connecticut, the great object of organizing the 
new Constitution, engrosses the attention of the people. It is with sincere satisfaction that I can assert, 
from personal observation, that the affection for the 
new system is increasing in these States, and that it is 
daily becoming highly popular. The Senators of those 
States are characters calculated to inspire confidence 
in the new Government, and are all highly federal. 
I am persuaded the Representatives will generally, if 
not entirely, be of the same description. As to Rhode 
Island, the majority are in such a train that nothing 
good can at present be expected from them; their 
paper money system and tender laws are sufficiently 
characteristic of their pursuits. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are also 
laboring under errors of conduct; but, from the powerful party in favor of the new system, something 
may be hoped from their ensuing elections. New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland are 
right. The late choice of Representatives in Pennsylvania, may be considered as a new and fair appeal 
to the people, as it respects their approbation of the 
new Government. Although the party in favor of 
their local Constitution have been brought to operate 
against the General Constitution, yet it appears the 
majority of the people are its firm supporters.

Mr. John Adams will probably have the plurality 
of votes for Vice-President. From his principles of 
government, as well as his professions of regard to 
the character universally decided on for the President, 
he will probably make a good Vice-President.

Major Haskell, who is going to Europe, is very 
solicitous to obtain your Excellency's certificate of his 
services. He sustained the character of a brave and 
good officer, and at present he supports the reputation of a good citizen. It is "with diffidence I ask 
this certificate ; but the request is made under such 
auspices, I cannot avoid it.

Our three youngest children have lately had the 
measles, and are, we hope, safely through the disorder. Our eldest children, Lucy and Harry, are about 
sickening with it. Mrs. Knox presents her respects 
to you, and unites with me in presenting our respects to Mrs. Washington. I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and humble servant,
