MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR proposal of coming to Europe has long and 
tenderly affected me. The dangers and inconveniences are such, and a European life would be so dis 
agreeable to you, that I have suffered a great deal of 
anxiety in reflecting upon it. And upon the whole, I 
think it will be most for the happiness of my family, 
and most for the honor of our country, that I should 
come home. I have, therefore, this day written to 
Congress a resignation of all my employments, and as 
soon as I shall receive their acceptance of it, I will 
embark for America, which will be in the spring or 
beginning of summer. Our son is now on his journey from Petersburg, through Sweden, Denmark, 
and Germany, and if it please God he come safe, he 
shall come with me, and I pray we may all meet once 
more, you and I never to separate again. 
Yours most tenderly, 
</p><p>
