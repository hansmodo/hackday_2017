My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Your kind letter of the 12th , concluded on the 15th , has been deliver'd to me barely time enough to run it over. 
</p><p>
The express is to be sent back immediately with 
dispatches that were ready, so that I shall have but 
few moments allowed me for writing to you. The 
little innovation in the epithet applied to Gen'l Howe's 
oration, I took the liberty of forming from Kite, a 
character in the comedy of the Recruiting Officer, 
and meant to draw a parallel between the sergeant's 
harangue and that of the General but upon recollection I believe I have done the former an injustice 
who confined his promises to more practicable things. 
I shall not now have time to give you my dear Father 
a particular account of the progress of the besiegers 
and persevering defence of our brave garrison, to the 
time when perpetual hail of musquetry and hand 
grenades from the round tops of the Empress of 
Russia, an East Indiaman cut down and converted 
into a floating battery of 18 twenty-four pounders, 
made it impossible for men to do any thing more in 
the fort than sacrifice themselves unrevenged. I hate 
to blame without sure grounds ; but as far as I can 
judge at this distance, the naval department has been 
deficient in its duty. The Commodore is brave, but 
has no command. The questions now are can we 
prevent the enemy's raising the chevaux de frise by 
keeping possession of Red Bank or Fort Mercer if 
the enemy should effect a lodgment on Mud Island 
can our fleet maintain its present position ? Is it not 
possible to take the Empress of Russia, and sink an obstruction in the channel thro which she pass'd ? I say 
yes to them all, except the second and the enemy's lodgm' may be prevented. 
</p><p>
You, my dear father will call me a presumptuous young man, especially when you hear that three general officers are gone to investigate these points on the 
spot. Pardon the manner of my letter, in consideration that I have been endeavouring to satisfy the problem which requires the most written in the least given 
time. Chagrined at the necessity of taking leave so abruptly, I console myself with the prospect of writing more deliberately in a day or two. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
