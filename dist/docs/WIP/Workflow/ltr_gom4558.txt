Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will find enclosed the copy of what I took the liberty 
to trouble you with on the thirteenth of last month. On Satur 
day, the seventeenth, I dined in company with Mr Fox. The 
state of French politics formed, of course, a large part of the 
conversation. The situation of other countries was then passed in review, and it became a question how far Britain might 
be engaged in the affairs of the continent. At length I took 
an opportunity to ask what system the administration had 
adopted respecting America. He told me that he could not 
tell, but he believed they had none, and would in all probability be governed by events. That he did not believe Mr Pitt 
would trouble his head about the matter, but would probably 
leave it to Lord Hawkesbury and Mr Grenville, who are both 
of them indisposed to us ; whereas Pitt himself is, he supposes, 
rather friendly than otherwise. Mr Fox said further, that he 
and Burke are now almost alone in their opinion, that we 
should be permitted to trade in our own bottoms to their 
islands, and that this opinion loses ground daily ; though for 
his own part he persists in it. 
</p><p>
I find that the ministers apply for information respecting 
America, and particularly American commerce, to a Mr Irvin, 
who long resided in America, and is now in the customs ; a 
mighty sour sort of creature, and one who seems to have a 
mortal aversion for us. I met him at dinner one day, and he 
took pains to let me know, that he was doing all he could to 
prevent any encouragement from being given to our exports, 
by the corn bill, which is now on the carpet. He declared 
that he would, by the force of starvation, oblige the people of 
Britain to raise corn enough for their own consumption, and 
that even the supply of the West India Islands ought to be 
provided in this country. 
</p><p>
You will readily perceive, sir, from this rude sketch of influential characters, that there is but little disposition for treating 
with us at present. I am, &c.
