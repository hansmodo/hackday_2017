Dear General, 
</p><p>
We are going on with the regimental arrangements as fast 
as possible, and I think the day begins to appear with respect to 
that business. Had our Saviour addressed a chapter to the rulers of mankind, as he did many to the subjects, I am persuaded his good sense would have dictated this text ; Be not wse 
overmuch. Had the several members, who compose our 
multifarious body, been only wise enough, our business would 
long since have been completed. But our superior abilities, 
or the desire of appearing to possess them, lead us to such 
exquisite tediousness of debate, that the most precious moments pass unheeded away like vulgar things. 
</p><p>
As to what you mention of the extraordinary demeanor 
of some gentlemen, I cannot but agree with you, that such 
conduct is not the most honorable. But, on the other hand, 
you must allow that it is the most safe, and certainly you are 
not to learn, that, however ignorant of that happy art in your 
own person, the bulk of us bipeds know well how to balance 
solid pudding against empty praise. There are other things, 
my dear Sir, besides virtue, which are their own reward. 
And the feelings of others will, unless I mistake, sooner or 
later break out into a retribution of those acts and neglects, 
which at present pass away unnoticed by the herd of observers, or rather lookers on.

As to your friend, who has thought proper to demand of 
you a command, I did believe from the first, that his resignation was, like some former ones from the same quarter, 
merely calculated to gain either promotion, or favor, or revenge. I was therefore led to expect, that his merits and 
our misfortune in losing him would become the topic of 
declamation, and took the earliest opportunity to express in the 
very strongest terms my satisfaction, my joy, at the receipt of 
the letter from him, and of consequence to assign the reasons why this event gave me so much pleasure. This gave a very 
different turn to affairs. Panegyric dwindled to apology, 
and no opposition was made to the main point of accepting 
his resignation. The next day I was informed, that he did not 
intend to resign, that his letter was quite misunderstood. &tc. 
The gentleman, however, had been so unlucky, as to use the 
most pointed terms, and therefore his aid, from whom the 
information came, was told that the observations he made came 
too late. I am persuaded, that he will attempt to get reinstated, 
if the least probability of success appears, but L am equally persuaded, that his attempts will fail. I believe his friends 
are hitherto of the same opinion, and therefore we have 
as yet had no attempts made in Congress, and possibly we 
never shall. I am, &c,
