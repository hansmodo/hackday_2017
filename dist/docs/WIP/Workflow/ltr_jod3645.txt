MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM so constantly engaged in business, most of which 
is new to me, that it seems as if it was impossible to 
find time to write even to you ; yet I believe I write 
every post. 
</p><p>
It proves to be a tedious business to clear the 
President's house for me. I am now told it will 
not be ready this week. You will see by the Gazette how the new Pennsylvania house is disposed of. 
The weather is bad. I have a great cold. The news 
is not pleasant, and I have no society but statesmen. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> has been here and is gone off to-day 
for Virginia. He is as he was, 
</p><p>
I cannot write to you about any thing at home. 
You must do as you judge best. I like all that you 
have proposed to me. I must not write about public 
affairs. I must go to you or you must come to me. 
I cannot live without you till October. But all will 
depend upon events and intelligence to come. My 
regards to the neighbors, duty to my mother, love to 
relations, &c. Oh ! my poor meadow and wall, &c., 
&c., &c. It would do me good like a medicine to 
see Billings one hour at any sort of work. 
</p><p>
I have no letter to-day, but I shall have one on 
Wednesday or Saturday. I find you don t forget 
your ever affectionate 
</p><p>
