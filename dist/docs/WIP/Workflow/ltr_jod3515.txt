MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE have received information that so many of our 
letters have been thrown overboard, that I fear you 
will not have heard so often from me as both of us 
wish. I have written often, but my letters have not 
been worth so much as other things which I have sent 
you. I sent you a small present by Captain Niles, 
but he is taken by a Jersey privateer. I sent you also 
some other things by Captain Barnes ; and what affects 
me quite as much, I sent the things that my dear 
brother Cranch requested me to send, by the same 
vessels. These vessels were chosen because they 
were fast sailers, and so small as to be able to see 
danger before they could be seen ; but all is taken 
and sent into Guernsey and Jersey. By Captain 
Tucker, I sent you the whole of the list you gave me 
of articles for the family. These, I hope, have ar- 
rived safe, but I have been so unlucky that I feel 
averse to meddling in this way. The whole loss is a 
trifle, it is true. But to you, in the convenience of the 
family, and to Mr. Cranch in his business, it would 
have been of value. If the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> arrives, the little 
chest she carries to you will be of service. 
</p><p>
My anxiety for you and for the public is not diminished by time or distance. The great number of 
accidental disappointments in the course of the last 
summer are afflicting. But we hope for better luck 
another year. It seems to be the intention of Heaven 
that we should be taught the full value of our liberty 
by the dearness of the purchase, and the importance 
of public virtue by the necessity of it. There seems 
to be also a further design, that of eradicating forever 
from the heart of every American, every tender sentiment towards Great Britain, that we may, sometime 
or other, know how to make the full advantage of our 
independence by more extensive connexions with other 
countries. Whatever syren songs of peace may be sung 
in your ears, you may depend upon it from me, (who 
unhappily have been seldom mistaken in my guesses of 
the intentions of the British government for fourteen 
years,) that every malevolent passion and every insidious art will predominate in the British cabinet 
against us. Their threats of Russians and of great 
reinforcements are false and impracticable, and they 
know them to be so ; but their threats of doing mis 
chief with the forces they have, will be verified as far 
as their power. 
</p><p>
It is by no means pleasant to me to be forever impuling malicious policy to a nation that I have ever 
wished and still wish I could esteem. But truth must 
be attended to ; and almost all Europe, the Dutch especially, are at this day talking of Great Britain in 
the style of American sons of liberty. I hope the unfortunate events at Rhode Island I will produce no 
heart-burnings between our countrymen and the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met acquaintance'>Comte D Estaing</a>, who is allowed by all Europe to be 
a great and worthy officer, and by all who know him to be a zealous friend of America. 
</p><p>
I have enjoyed uncommon health since my arrival 
in this country, and, if it was peace and my family 
here, I could be happy. But never, never shall I en 
joy happy days without either. My little son gives 
me great pleasure both by his assiduity to his books, 
and his discreet behavior. The lessons of his mamma are a constant lesson to him, and the reflection 
that they are so to his sister and brothers are a never- 
failing consolation to me at times when I feel more 
tenderness for them than words can express, or than I 
should choose to express, if I had power. Remember 
me in the most affectionate manner to our parents, 
brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and what shall I say 
children. 
</p><p>
My respects where they are due, which is in so 
many places that I cannot name them. With regard 
to my connexions with the public business here, which 
you will be naturally inquisitive to know something of, 
I can only say, that we have many disagreeable cir-

wishes of our constituents, and to give satisfaction to 
certain half-anglified Americans, and what is more 
serious and affecting, to real and deserving Americans, 
who are suffering in England, and escaping from 
thence. But from this court, this city and nation, I 
have experienced nothing but uninterrupted politeness. It is not possible for me to express more tenderness and affection to you than will be suggested by 
the name of
