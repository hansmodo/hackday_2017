Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have thoughts of sailing for London in the Miller, and I beg your sentiments with the same candor, that I deliver my 
own. I shall pay most regard to your advice, because I believe it will be dictated by friendship, and founded on a more intimate knowledge of me than I possess. 
</p><p>
The advantages I expect from a twelve months' sojourning in England are shortly these. I hope to form some acquaintances, that may hereafter be of service to me, to model 
myself after some persons, who cut a figure in the profession 
of the law, to form my manners and address by the example of 
the truly polite, to rub off in the gay circle a few of those many barbarisms, which characterize a provincial education, and 
to curb that vain self sufficiency, which arises from comparing 
ourselves with companions who are inferior to us. As this 
last is the most agreeable, so it is the most dangerous kind of 
flattery, the surest source of vanity, a disease which can be 
cured only by conversing with our superiors in understanding. 
</p><p>
There are many dangers, which it is alleged attend a 
young man thrown from under his parents' wings upon the 
gay stage of pleasure and dissipation, where a wanton circle 
of delusive joys courts his acquaintance, and an endless variety of objects prevents satiety and removes disgust ; and to all 
the trite observations that may be made on this subject in the 
present instance, perhaps it may be added, that I have naturally a taste for pleasure, and, if it be allowed that I have a 
taste for pleasure, it may naturally follow that I shall avoid 
those low pleasures, which abound in as great an exuberance 
on this as on the other side of the Atlantic. As for those 
poignant joys, which are the lot of the affluent, like Tantalus 
I may grasp at them, but they will certainly be out of my 
reach. I might go farther and make my observations more 
particular, but as Lord Bacon told the Commons, with respect 
to his Majesty's power and prerogative, these things are better 
to be imagined by you than expressed by me. 
</p><p>
I desire, however, that you will consider how much better my time may now be spared than hereafter. I have somehow or other been so hurried through the different scenes of 
childhood and youth, that I have still some time left to pause 
before I tread the great stage of life, and you know how much 
our conduct there depends upon the mode of our education. 
After what I have said, it will be needless to add, that my inclinations have taken part in this debate. However, believe 
me, my doubts and hopes have agreed to make you their arbiter, and there is a rule of submission entered in the court of 
conscience. I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant,
