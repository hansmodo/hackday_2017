DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I have not now before me your letter, which came with the 
sample of silk, having put it into the hands of Mr. Walpole 
with the sample, who has promised me full and particular 
answers to all your queries, after the silk has been thoroughly 
examined. In the mean time he tells me, the best sort appears to him to be worth in itself twenty-seven or twenty eight shillings a pound, and will fetch that price when some 
imperfections in the reeling it are remedied. He tells me 
farther, that the best eggs are to be had from Valencia in 
Spain, whence he will procure some for you against the next 
year ; the worms from those eggs being the strongest, healthiest, and producing the finest silk of any others; and he 
thinks you should get some reelers from Italy, which he would 
likewise undertake to do for you if desired. He is one of 
the most opulent and noble-spirited merchants of this kingdom. 
</p><p>
I shall write to you fully by Osborne, with all the information I can procure. In the mean time, please to present my 
respects to the gentlemen concerned in the affair, and assure 
them of my best services. I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
