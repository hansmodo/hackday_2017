DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Two days ago I arrived here from Virginia, which 
the late short adjournment just allowed me time to 
visit and return from. I brought two letters from 
thence for you, which come with this. Having some 
business with Colonel Mason, I travelled that road, 
and having sent to your lady to know if she had 
any commands this way, had the pleasure to learn 
that all were well at <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>. As I suppose 
it will be agreeable to you to know what is passing 
in Virginia, I have inclosed you the proceedings of 
our last Convention, with two of Purdie's Gazettes. 
</p><p>
I am greatly obliged to you for your favor of 
August the 29th, and you may be assured I shall 
pay great attention to it. When I mentioned securing  the entrance of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, it was 
more in the way of wishing it could be done, than 
as conceiving it very practicable. However, the reasons you assign are most conclusive against the at 
tempt. I assure you, that so far as I can judge 
from the conversation of men, instead of there being 
any who think you have not done enough, the wonder seems to be, that you have done so much. I 
believe there is not a man of common sense, and 
who is void of prejudice, in the world, but greatly 
approves the discipline you have introduced into the 
camp ; since reason and experience join in proving, 
that without discipline armies are fit only for the 
contempt and slaughter of their enemies. Your 
labors are no doubt great, both of mind and body, 
but if the praise of the present and future times 
can be any compensation, you will have a plentiful 
portion of that. Of one thing you may certainly 
rest assured, that the Congress will do every thing 
iii their powder to make your most weighty business 
easy to you. I think you could not possibly have 
appointed a better man to his present office than Mr. 
Mifflin. He is a singular man, and you certainly 
will meet with the applause and support of all good 
men, by promoting and countenancing real merit and 
public virtue, in opposition to all private interests 
and partial affections. You will see, in the proceeding's of our Convention, that they have agreed to 
raise the pay of our rifle officers and men to the 
Virginia standard. It may, perhaps, encourage them 
to be told this. 
</p><p>
We have no late accounts from England ; but from 
what we have had that can be relied on, it seems 
almost certain, that our enemies there must shortly 
meet with a total overthrow. The entire failure 
of all their schemes, and the rising spirit of the 
people, strongly expressed by the remonstrance of 
the Livery of London to the King, clearly denote 
this. The ministry had their sole reliance on the 
impossibility of the Americans finding money to sup 
port an army, on the great aid their cause would 
receive from Canada, and consequent triumph of their 
forces over the liberties and rights of America. The 
reverse of all this has happened ; and very soon, now, 
our commercial resistance will begin sorely to distress the people at large. 
</p><p>
The ministerial recruiting business in England has 
entirely failed them ; the ship-builders in the royal 
yards have mutinied ; and now they are driven, as 
to their last resort, to seek for soldiers on the High 
lands of Scotland. But it seems the greatest willingness of the people there cannot supply more 
than one or two thousand men, a number rather calculated to increase their disgrace, than to give success 
to their cause. 
</p><p>
I beg your pardon for engaging your attention so 
long, and assure you that I am, with unfeigned 
esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and countryman, 
</p><p>
