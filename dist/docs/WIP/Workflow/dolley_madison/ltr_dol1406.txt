TO HER NIECE, MARY CUTTS.

Your letter, my dearest niece, with the one before it, came quite sa fely, for which 
I return many thanks and kisses. I rejoice too, dear Dolly, to see how well you write 
and express yourself, and am as proud of all your acquirements as if you were my 
own daughter. I trust you will yet be with me this summer, when I shall see 
your improvement in person also, and enjoy the sweet assurance of your affection. 
Mary Lee and her husband have been in disposed, but are better. They say often 
they hope you will come with your dear mother, as do all your relatives and friends 
in this quarter. The old lady, even the negroes, young and old, want to see you, dear.

We had old Mr. Patterson and his son Edward from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> to stay with us 
several days, and they tell me that Madame Bonaparte is still in France, and her 
son gone to Rome to visit his father. Mr. Monroe left us yesterday, disappointed in 
his views of raising money from his land. Mr. B. continued on his way to the Springs, 
and I was disappointed at not sending a packet to you, inclosing the flounce which 
I wanted you to wear, worked by me long ago.

I received by the last post a letter from your cousin Payne, at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> ; he 
writes in fine health and spirits, and says he will be detained only a few weeks 
longer in that city. I sincerely hope to see him soon, though it is impossible for 
him to prefer Virginia to the North. If I were in <a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a> with you I know I 
could not conform to the formal rules of visiting they now have, but would disgrace 
myself by rushing about among my friends at all hours. Here I find it most agreeable 
to stay at home, everything around me is so beautiful. Our garden promises grapes 
and figs in abundance, but I shall not enjoy them unless your mamma comes, and 
brings you to help us with them ; tell the boys they must come too. Alas ! poor Walter, away at sea ! I can scarcely trust my 
self to think of him, his image fills my eyes with tears. 
</p><p>
Adieu, and believe me always your tender mother and aunt, 
</p><p>

P. S. We are very old-fashioned here. Can you send me a paper pattern of the 
present sleeve, and describe the width of dress and waist ; also how turbans are 
pinned up, bonnets worn, as well as how to behave in the fashion?
