TO MRS. ISAAC WINSTON.

April, <a href="/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.

I consider myself a most unlucky being, my dearest aunt, in regard to my letters 
to you, for you certainly cannot have received my two last or you would have alluded to them in yours, which we have 
this moment received. What must my dear uncle think of me ! but I will now 
take the opportunity to scold you for not knowing my heart better, which has always been open to you, you speak to me 
in apologies for my Cousin Dolly's stay, when I have considered it as a favor, and a 
very great pleasure, only wishing we could live together all our lives. We hope and 
expect to go to you in May. Public business, perhaps, was never thicker. I have 
just received a long letter from mamma, who is quite well, and I pray that your 
fears may not be realized, my dear aunt, but that you may yet spend a great deal 
of time together in this life. I should be miserable, indeed, if I did not feel such a 
conviction. I am taking care of my best prunes and figs for you. Tell dear uncle 
I am ashamed to speak to him, but he will see by this that it was not my fault. Fare 
well, dearest aunt, I have nothing new to tell you as you must know all about Burr.

Ever your devoted, <a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
