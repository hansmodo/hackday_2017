MY DEAREST MARY, I hasten to answer your nice letter in order to obtain 
your forgiveness about the mislaid letter ; I fear Beckey may have used it to kindle 
the fire she was so anxious about for her master, and as far as I can discover collected everything in the way of paper on 
my table this morning. It was so short I hope you can recollect enough of it to 
write it again for your amiable correspondent, to whom give my assurance of 
love. I am so grieved that your mamma is not well, but trust it proceeds from 
fatigue. Do persuade her to go to see Mrs. B., and not to worry about household 
cares. I hope the alarm of "insurrections" is over in the city, though every one should 
be on guard after this. I am quiet, hearing little about it, and quite helpless if 
in danger. Tell Mr. Trist I send him a few leaves, if not the whole flower, of his 
dear lady (Cape Jessamine), who is now blooming, when all her contemporaries 
have changed color and are passing away, emblematic of her good disposition and 
heart, whose fragrance will last until the end.

Your Uncle Madison still wears the bead ring you placed on his finger, and I 
see him look at it every now and then without saying anything. 
</p><p>
My eyes are troubling me, still I write on a great deal of nonsense. To-morrow 
I expect a large party from Richmond and the lower country to stay with us. I feel 
very grateful to all those ladies who are so kind to your mother while she is ailing, 
and could love the blackest Indian who was good to her ; indeed, it seems to me 
I would like to bribe the whole world to make her well. Payne is on the wing 
again with three gentlemen in his train. 
</p><p>
Adieu, dearest niece. Ever yours, 
</p><p>
