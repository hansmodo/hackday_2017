We spent last evening at Mr. Pichon's. Our city is now almost deserted, and will 
be more so in a week or two. Dr. and Mrs. T. sat yesterday for the last time to 
Stuart. He has now nearly finished all his portraits, and says he means to go directly 
to <a href="/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, but that is what he has said these two years ; being a man of genius, 
he of course does things differently from other people. I hope he will be here next 
winter, as he has bought a square to build a " Temple " upon. Where will you celebrate the Fourth of July, my dear sister ? 
We are to have grand doings here. Mr. Van Ness is to deliver an oration, Mr. L. 
says, in the woods, and the ladies are to be permitted to partake of the mirth. We 
have lately had a great treat in the company of a charming Prussian Baron. All 
the ladies say they are in love with him, notwithstanding his want of personal 
charms. He is the most polite, modest, well-informed, and interesting traveller we 
have ever met, and is much pleased with America. I hope one day you will become 
acquainted with our charming Baron Humboldt. He sails in a few days for France with his companions, and is going to publish an account of his travels in South 
America, where he lived five years ; proposing to return here again. He had with 
him a train of philosophers, who, though clever and entertaining, did not compare to the Baron.
