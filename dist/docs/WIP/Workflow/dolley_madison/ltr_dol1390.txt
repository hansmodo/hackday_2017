TO GOVERNOR COLES, ILLINOIS.

I am afraid, dear cousin, that while you and I deliberate who to choose for a wife, 
we shall lose some -of the finest girls now grown. For instance, it is reported that 
Ellen Randolph is to be married to General Cooke, and Virginia to William Burwell. Our niece Eliza 
was married to Mr. Willis in May, and his sister is to be bound 
to her brother on the 16th of this month ; still I have hopes for you, that your future 
one may become manifest to reward your merits and long search.

We have been expecting a visit from my beloved Sally, until within the last few 
days, when I was informed she had gone to the Virginia Springs. Payne still says he will write to you. I suspect he begins to 
feel with you that a good wife would add to his happiness. I am sadly disappointed 
at not having my dear Lucy with me next winter ; the Judge has persuaded her to 
remain in Frankfort until they can remove altogether, which the change in the judiciary will soon authorize him to do. We 
have now with us a visitor from <a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, the curious Captain O'Brion ; he tells 
us a medley of news, blended with sea-phrases, which, to appreciate, you must 
hear. The President passed a day with us on his return to the city, and looked much 
better than was expected after his fatigues. <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> has gone with him to Loudon. 
I must not expect to amuse you, only in truth can assure you of our affectionate interest and friendship, hoping to see you soon amongst us.
