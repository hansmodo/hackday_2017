TO MR. EDWARD COLES. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, May 12, <a href="/results.php?year=1813">1813</a>. 
</p><p>
Your letter caused me great affliction, my dear cousin ; the continuation of your 
illness, and Payne's reluctance at leaving America, left me without fortitude to 
write, until now that a letter has come from my son on ship-board, in which he 
expresses satisfaction at all around him. He had seen Mr. Swertchkoff, who assured 
him you would soon be well in spite of yourself. We indulge this pleasing hope 
in addition to that of your remaining with us, to the last. Not that I would for the 
world retard any plan for your prosperity ; but that I flatter myself the western 
country may be given up for something more consonant with your happiness, and 
that of your connections, among them there are none who feel a more affectionate interest in you than <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> and 
myself. I hope you will believe that such is our regard and esteem for you that we 
should consider your leaving us a misfortune. <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> can do very well with 
out a secretary until your health is reestablished. The winter is not a season for 
emigration, so that next summer you will be better able to make your election to go, or not to go.

And now if I could I would describe to you the fears and alarms that circulate 
around me. For the last week all the city and Georgetown (except the Cabinet) have 
expected a visit from the enemy, and were not lacking in their expressions of terror 
and reproach. Yesterday an express announced the pause of a frigate at the 
mouth of the Potomac. The commander sent his boats to examine a Swedish ship 
that lay near, but our informer was too frightened to wait for further news. We 
are making considerable efforts for defense. The fort is being repaired, and five hundred 
militia, with perhaps as many regulars, are to be stationed on the Green, near the 
Windmill, or rather Major Taylor s. The twenty tents already look well in my eyes, 
who have always been an advocate for fighting when assailed, though a Quaker. 
I therefore keep the old Tunisian sabre within reach. One of our generals has 
discovered a plan of the British, it is to land as many chosen rogues as they can 
about fourteen miles below Alexandria, in the night, so that they may be on hand to 
burn the President's house and offices. I do not tremble at this, but feel hurt that 
the admiral (of Havre de Grace memory) should send me word that he would make 
his bow at my drawing-room very soon. Mrs. Buonaparte and Miss Stevenson returned to their house four days ago to 
secure their wardrobe, but I question whether they leave us again, as strangers 
and members are crowding in. Mr. Monroe and family dined with us yesterday in 
a large party given to Mr. Jones. Mr. Hay is with them, having come to escort 
Mrs. Monroe to Richmond on a visit of three weeks to her two daughters. Cousin 
Sally is still in South Carolina, and Miss Mayo is as gay as ever. <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a> has not 
been very well of late, and her children are ill with measles, so that I confine my self very much with them. 
</p><p>
Be careful of yourself, dear cousin, and return as soon as you can to your anxious friends.
