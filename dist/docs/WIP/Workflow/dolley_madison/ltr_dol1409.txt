DEAREST MARY, Yours, ending on the 2d of January, came to relieve my oppressed heart with the tidings of your beloved mother s recovery 
from that extreme illness, under which I knew or feared she was laboring. 
</p><p>
I had written a week ago this day to Dolly and one to you, inclosed to your 
father, which could hardly have reached you, or you would have yielded to my 
pleadings for that single line by every post which would tell me your mamma is better 
and has a prospect of regaining her health. To secure this, my dearest girls, you must 
help her in every way you can, keep her room quiet, and herself free from the 
slightest agitation or uneasiness. The nervousness of which Dr. Sim speaks must 
be attended to with all your delicacy of thought and conduct ; her sufferings have caused it, and now, no one should approach 
her who is not sensible of the importance of smiles and comfort to one who has been 
so near the grave. May Heaven sustain and support her for many years to come to bless you with her protecting love. 
</p><p>
I inclose " The Oxonians," which I could not read, while my heart was oppressed by 
fears for you all. We are well and send love Your own aunt, 
</p><p>
