MY DEAREST <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, I received with joy your letter last evening, which, being 
longer than usual, raised my spirits, which have been rather low in these troublous 
times. No Constitution heard of yet ; the Hornet went to take despatches and to let 
them know our determination to fight for our rights. I wrote by the Hornet to Mrs. Barlow, and begged her to send me any thing she thought suitable in the way of 
millinery. I fear I cannot obtain a new-fashioned pattern for you, but will make 
you a cap such as is much worn. The intrigues for President and Vice - President 
go on, but I think it may terminate as the last did. The Clintons, Smiths, Armstrongs, et cetera, are all in the field, and I 
believe there will be war. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> sees no end to the perplexities without it, 
and they seem to be going on with the preparations. General Dearborn, you know, 
is nominated to command. Congress talks of adjourning for two months, but I believe it is merely a threatening, and they 
will sit until June. Before then I trust you will be able to come on, as the roads become passable by April. 
</p><p>
Devotedly your sister, 
</p><p>
