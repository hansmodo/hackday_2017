If my beloved sister has received my last from <a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, she will be unhappy 
to find that I was obliged to take this journey in such dangerously hot weather, but 
it proved not unpleasant, for I was easier riding than in any other position. My 
health and spirits revived every day with the drive, and here I am on my bed, with 
my dear husband sitting anxiously by me, who is my most willing nurse. But you 
know how delicate he is. I tremble for him ; one night on the way he was taken 
very ill with his old complaint, and I could not fly to aid him as I used to do. Heaven 
in its mercy restored him next morning, and he would not pause until he heard my 
fate from Doctor Physic.

Your devoted sister, <a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY </a>.
