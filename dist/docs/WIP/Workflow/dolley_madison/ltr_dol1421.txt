I could never doubt your sympathy, dear brother, and require it much now. When 
can you come and see me? I hope it will be soon, relying on that hearty welcome 
always in store for you, and each one of your dear children, who have been even as 
my own. I wish you would see Mr. Morris at the Highlands, and say to him from me 
that his friendship is a dear consolation. I prize his advice, and, as from my early 
and most faithful friend, will strive to follow that contained in his letter of the 1st 
as well as any other which he may extend to me when he visits <a href="/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>. ... I 
would write more, dear Richard, but have no power over my confused and oppressed 
mind to speak fully of the enduring goodness of my beloved husband. He left me many pledges of his confidence and love ; 
especially do I value all his writings. From the proceeds of the first part of the "Debates in the Convention," I have to pay donations to several institutions. My 
brother and son are making a copy to send to England.

Adieu, with love,
