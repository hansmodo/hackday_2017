MY DEAREST ANNA, Yours from Maine reached me yesterday, and I need not say 
how delighted I am at your description of places and persons, and at the knowledge 
of your felicity. We go to <a href="/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a> this week. Payne continues weak and 
sick ; and my prospects rise and fall to sadness as this precious child recovers or 
declines. You have heard, no doubt, of the terrible duel and death of poor Hamilton. I sent the President word of your 
offer to get the glass, etc.
