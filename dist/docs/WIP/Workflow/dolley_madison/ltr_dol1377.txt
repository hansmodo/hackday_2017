<a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">WASHINGTON</a>, March 27, <a href="/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.

I am grieved, my dear <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, at not hearing a word from you since you left us ! 
What can be the matter ? If the precious children engross your time, surely my 
good brother would think to relieve my anxiety by writing himself. This is the 
twelfth day of your absence, and I know not where to direct to you, but shall venture this to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; the postmaster 
will forward it, should you be gone. <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> is very unwell with a cold, but is 
able to go to the office. We see no certain prospect of going to Orange yet. The 
President has a sick headache every day, and is obliged to retire to a dark room 
every morning by nine o clock ; he will not leave this until April 6th. I suppose 
you have heard that Burr is retaken, and on his way to Richmond for trial. We 
are quiet, and have but few parties. We went to the wedding feast of Miss Stoddard, and dined last Saturday with Mr. Erskine. Miss Clinton is still here with her father, but they have sent for a vessel, 
and intend sailing in a few days.

Ever thy loving sister, <a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY</a>.
