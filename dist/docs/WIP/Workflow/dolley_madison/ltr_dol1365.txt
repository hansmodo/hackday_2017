I am always rejoiced to hear from you, 
dearest <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, and glad you have recovered my letters. There is so much I could tell 
you about these new French people, things that could not fail to divert you, but I must forbear, and am learning to hold my tongue well. Madame shows me 
everything she has, and would fain give me of everything. She decorates herself 
according to the French ideas, and urges me to do the same. She is very anxious 
to see my " belle soeur," as she styles you, and oh ! Anna, I m dying to come to your 
country ; if I could only be with you how glad I should be.
