TO MRS. JOHN PAYNE.

Expressions are wanting, my dearest mother, to convey to you my feelings ; I 
have not been very well since hearing from poor Mary, and it seems to me I can 
never feel as I have done. Dolly and Lucy both gone ! they are now angels, and 
can never know evil or misery ; ought we not to console ourselves with this reflection? I trust my beloved mother, whose 
trials have been so many, will exercise her fortitude, which is to preserve her for 
those of us that are left. I wrote thee by the last post, and have written repeatedly 
to John, but received only the inclosed letters. I shall now look out for vessels going to the Mediterranean, and write by 
them to him ; thine for him, thee had better inclose to me. Payne is to follow us 
in the stage on the 14th ; I am looking for a letter to cheer me with news of thy health. 
</p><p>
Ever thine, affectionately, 
</p><p>
