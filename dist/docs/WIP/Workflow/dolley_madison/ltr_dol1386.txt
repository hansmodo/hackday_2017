This unexpected opportunity and short notice, my beloved friends, scarce gives 
me time to embrace you round ; still I do it with my whole heart. I have received 
all your most welcome letters Mr. Barlow's and Mr. Lee s, by the Constitution, 
with one, too, from Mr. Warden all of which I should like to answer now, were 
it not that the despatches go in one hour, and I can only return to each individual 
my love and best thanks for their goodness and friendship. Before this, you know of 
our Embargo, to be followed by War ! ! Yes, that terrible event is at hand, I fear ; 
our appointments for the purpose are mostly made, and the recruiting business 
goes on with alacrity. The major-generals are Henry Dearborn, <a href="/results.php?tla=top" rel="">Thomas Pinckney</a>, Joseph Bloomfield, J. Winchester, Wm. Polk, Wm. Hull, et cetera. You will 
have an account of our political situation in all its shades by this vessel. We anticipate some little contention among our 
selves on the death of the Vice-President, whose physicians give out that he cannot 
live until morning. The sentiment is in favor of John Langdon as his successor. 
Congress will remain in session, perhaps, until July ; if not, full power to declare 
war will be vested in the President.

Your letters by the Neptune were particularly acceptable, as we had been worried by a report that the Emperor had 
seized the Hornet, and as I promised to write you everything, personal or impersonal, you will pardon me if I say aught 
that gives you pain, in preparing you for the disappointment expressed at Mr. Barlow's having told the state of his negotiations to Mr. Granger, who directly gave it 
circulation, and a place in the newspapers. The objection to this communication is 
" that you may yet be disappointed ; the anticipations of such a treaty might cause 
improper speculations ; " " that Mr. G. was not a proper channel," and much of the 
same kind. All this is from the people, not from the Cabinet, yet you know every thing vibrates there.

Tell Mr. Lee that I shall be ever grateful for the fatigue and trouble he must 
have experienced for my sake, in procuring the valuable collection he sent me ; 
the bill was immediately paid, but he will be astonished at the amount of duties 
two thousand dollars. I fear I shall never have money enough to send again. All 
the articles are beautiful ; the heads I could not get on, being a little tight, so I 
shall lay them aside until next winter, when I can have them enlarged to fit. 
The flowers, trimmings, and ornaments were enchanting. I wish I could gratify 
you, my dear friend, in the matter of the portraits you so kindly wish of us ; but I 
see little prospect at present of accomplishing it. Stuart is far from us, and we 
have no painter of skill in this place ; be assured, if an opportunity occurs, I will do 
my best to send you what you wish. My sister Lucy has gone, and <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a> not yet come ; you may imagine me the very 
shadow of my husband. Do write me continually of your dear selves, and what 
you are doing ; you cannot image the impatience felt when you are silent. 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate 
</p><p>
