<a href="/results.php?city=montpelier" rel="city">Montpelier</a>, August 28, <a href="/results.php?year=1808">1808</a>. 
</p><p>
With heartfelt joy, my beloved sister, did I receive the short letter of my brother, 
giving the good tidings of your third son, and the promising health of you both. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=mad' rel='spouse met'>Mr. Madison</a>, Lucy, George, and Payne were with me, and we all clapped our 
hands in triumph. The post did not come for a week after the letter, or I should have 
written you directly; and since that we have passed nearly a week at Monticello. 
Mrs. Randolph has a third son likewise, and she calls him Benjamin Franklin. 
Ann is to be married on the 15th, and I left them busy in their preparations. The Monroes were at their seat near here, but I did not see much of them. 
</p><p>
Lucy left me on the 24th, and George seemed no better. We expect to go back 
to the city the last of September, because of public business. The President and 
Madison have been greatly perplexed by the remonstrances from so many towns 
to remove the Embargo. You see they refer to Congress, and the evading it is 
a terrible thing. Madison is uneasy and feels bound to return to the seat of government, where I shall be sorry to go so 
soon. The hope of my meeting you, dear <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a>, is the chief sweetener to my prospect. The family here are as they always 
are, most affectionate and kind, and send a thousand loves to you. I expect a large party to fill the house next week. 
</p><p>
Ever thy <a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">DOLLY</a>.
