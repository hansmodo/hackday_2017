I have received by post just now, my ever dear cousin, your welcome letter, and 
cannot express my anxiety to embrace you once more ; but a spell rests upon me, and 
withholds me from those I love most in this world ; not a mile can I go from 
home ; and in no way can I account for it, but that my husband is fixed here, and 
hates to have me leave him. This is the third winter in which he has been engaged 
in the arrangement of papers, and the business seems to accumulate as he proceeds, 
so that it might outlast my patience, and yet I cannot press him to forsake a duty 
so important, or find it in my heart to leave him during its fulfillment. We very 
often speak of you, and the many causes of our admiration for you, concluding, by 
assuring one another, that if we could leave home this winter, it should be only to visit 
you and Mr. Stevenson. Allow us, then, my dear, to retain the privilege you so 
kindly give us, of our rooms, where you shall some day see us.

This fall I had the pleasure of receiving a visit from Mrs. Randolph, her sister, and 
Ellen ; they told me you had been indisposed, and from your silence, I feared you 
had not recovered. I receive letters every week from my sister <a href="/results.php?tla=apc" rel="sibling met">Anna</a> ; she is in a 
round of pleasant society, and though devoted as ever to her children, takes time 
to enjoy a good dance. Mrs. Brown, whom you may remember, has rented a house 
near her, gives a great many handsome parties. Mrs. Crawford, <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel=''>Mrs. Adams</a>, and many others keep up the fashion of dissipation. Our love, dear cousin, to you and yours, hoping to see you ere long. 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours,
