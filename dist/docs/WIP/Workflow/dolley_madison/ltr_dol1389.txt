July 2, <a href="/results.php?year=1813">1813</a>.

I have the happiness to assure you, my dear cousin, that <a href="/results.php?tla=mad" rel="spouse met">Mr. Madison</a> recovers ; 
for the last three weeks his fever has been so slight as to permit him to take bark 
every hour and with good effect. It is three weeks now I have nursed him, night 
and day, sometimes with despair ! but now that I see he will get well I feel as if 
I might die myself from fatigue. Adieu ! 
</p><p>
Ever yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=dol" rel="me">D. P. MADISON.</a>.
