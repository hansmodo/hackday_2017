DEAREST DOLLY, Payne met a friend (Mr. H.) of yours yesterday at Orange 
Court House, and brought him home to dinner, with his two cousins. We were 
much pleased with his society, as well as the account he gave of you and Mary. He 
told me of your pleasant party, and how much he admired and regarded you both, 
but not half as much about you as I want to know ; indeed, how could he, when my love for you makes me wish to trace your 
every word and deed throughout the year. He gave me your letter, and told us about 
all the great personages now with you ; but what was my grief to receive only one 
music-box ! the box I prized the one you and Mary gave me was missing ! I will hope, however, that it was left with you, 
and I shall still hear it in these deep shades. 
</p><p>
Your inquiries after your uncle, and how we pass our time, can be more accurately 
answered. My days are devoted to nursing and comforting my sick patient, who 
walks only from the bed in which he break fasts to another, in the little room in which 
you left him ; he is a little better, but not well enough to get into a carriage to drive 
to the Springs, which I fondly hoped he might do. I expect Mrs. Randolph, Septimia, and two Misses Jefferson Randolph 
to-morrow, to pass a few days. My love to Dolly and Richard, and accept my apology for this scrawl. 
</p><p>
Your own and always, 
</p><p>
