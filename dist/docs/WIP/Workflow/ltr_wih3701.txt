Dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing of any considerable consequence has happened since I had the honor last to write you. The 
French troops are landed, and encamped in a fine 
situation, to the south-east of the town, and extend 
nearly across the Island. The troops make a good 
appearance. The legion, under the command of the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Duke De Lauzun</a> (the officer who took Senegal the 
last year), is as fine a corps as ever I saw. It is 
about six hundred strong. The officers express, the 
highest satisfaction at the treatment they meet with. 
The markets are become very good, and great regularity is preserved. In short, in every respect, I may 
say, hitherto every thing appears agreeable and satisfactory. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received a letter from a gentleman in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, advising that a vessel is just sent 
into that port, which was one of a fleet of thirty-six sail from Ireland for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I have given information of it to the General and Admiral, and, I apprehend, some of the fleet will go out on a cruise. The 
Hermione has been cruising for these three or four 
days. 1 have the honor to he, with the greatest respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
