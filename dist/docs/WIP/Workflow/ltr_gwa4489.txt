Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive the disappointment and mortification you have suffered, upon finding the flattering 
prospects of filling your line so unexpectedly blasted, 
by the anxious sensations I have experienced on the 
same subject. If what has been so often urged and 
repeated will not excite the States to the most strenuous exertions, in completing the Continental battalions, 
I almost despair of success from any thing I can add to 
my former representations, arguments, and entreaties. 
</p><p>
This however should not relax our unremitting endeavours to serve our country to the extent of our abilities 
in every possible way. 
</p><p>
The desire you express for active service is very 
commendable. I beg you will be persuaded, that I 
have not the least inclination to restrain so laudable a 
passion. You will therefore be at liberty to attempt 
to rouse the spirit of the country, and put yourself at 
the head of the cavalry, in the manner you propose. 
I sincerely 'wish your efforts may be crowned with 
success. If the State has not already appointed a 
general officer to command the State troops, destined 
for the southern service, I could wish these troops might also be put under your orders. Possibly it might be well to present an offer of your services, and 
to intimate that you have my consent to accept this command, if the State should think proper to confer it upon you. I am, &,c.
