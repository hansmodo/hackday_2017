DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I duly received your several Favours of July 12, Nov. 6, 
and 15, and am glad that my little Communications afforded 
you any Pleasure. I join with you most cordially in Wishes 
of a perfect happy Union between Great Britain and the 
Colonies. This is only to be expected from Principles of 
Justice and Equity on both sides, which we must endeavour 
to cultivate. I think there is now a Disposition here to treat 
us more equitably, and I hope it will increase and prevail. 
</p><p>
I esteem the Appointment to the Agency of your Province, 
unexpected and unsolicited by me, as one of the greatest 
Honours for which I must think myself indebted to your 
Friendship. I wish I may be able to do my Country effectual 
Service ; nothing could make me more happy. I shall however, use my most faithful Endeavours. I had, before I 
heard of this Appointment, openly opposed the Project of 
abridging our Charter Privileges, which some of our Adversaries were extremely busy in ; designing to do it by an act 
of Parliament ; a Bill for the purpose being, as I have heard, 
actually drawn ready to be brought in. I boldly and openly 
asserted that Parliament had no such power; and that an 
Attempt of that kind would, by alarming all America, raise 
a new Flame there, & tend more to loosen the Connections 
now subsisting, than any step that had yet been taken. I do 
not know that the freedom I use in declaring and publishing 
these Sentiments had much Effect ; I rather think the Apprehension of an approaching War inclined Government to milder 
Measures, and to hearken less to the mad Projects of our Adversaries. So it is, however, that the Scheme has been laid 
aside, and will, I think, hardly be resumed, tho' the Expectation of War is much lessened. 
</p><p>
It makes me happy to learn that my Ideas on a certain subject appeared just to you and your Friends. I have now in 
hand a piece (intended for the publick at a convenient Time) l 
which I hope will satisfy many others even on this side the 
Water, that every lady of Genoa is not a Queen of Corsica. 
Just at this Juncture here, perhaps His more prudent to be 
quiet, to stir no new questions, to let heats abate ; and when 
men are cooler, Reason may be better heard. I think I shall 
send my Manuscript to America for the Perusal and Correction of my Friends and for their Advice on the Expediency 
of its being published, before I venture it into the World. 
You I hope will give me leave to trouble you with it, as it 
seems to me a Question of great Importance to us all. 
</p><p>
You have given, in a little Compass, so full and comprehensive a View of the Circumstances on which is founded the 
Security Britain has for all reasonable Advantages from us, 
tho' things were put into the same State in which they were 
before the Stamp Act, that I cannot refrain communicating 
an Extract of your Letter, where I think it may be of Use; 
and I think I shall publish it. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt of an Intention here to make all our 
Governors independent of the People for their Support, as 
fast as the American Duties will bear the Expense. In this 
Point I think all Parties are against us: And nothing appears to them more unreasonable than that we should wish 
to have our Governors under such Influence, when the King himself, as they say, is always made independent of the Parliament here, in that Respect, by a fixed Civil List Revenue. 
I have endeavoured to show the Injustice of taxing those 
Colonies (who have always supported their own Government) 
for the support of other Governments in which they have no 
Interest, and the great Difference between a Prince, whose 
Welfare and that of his Family is intimately connected with 
the Prosperity of the Nation, and a governor who comes 
from another Country to make Money, and intends to return 
to the Place whence he came, where he will not hear the 
Complaints and Curses of those he has oppress'd and plunder'd, nor his Children be less respected or fare the worse for 
the Malfeasance of their Father. But it is so sweet a thing 
to have the Giving of Places of great and sure Profit to Friends 
and Favorites; and the prospect of doing it out of other 
Revenues than those of this Nation, at which Parliament is 
therefore less likely to take Umbrage, is so tempting, that I 
think scarce anything said or to be said here will avail much 
towards discouraging the project. There is indeed one Thing 
(if that is in their power), the refraining absolutely from 
the Use of all Commodities subject to the Duty. The Deficiency of the Revenue to pay the Salaries, and those to be 
made good by the Treasury here, might possibly put some 
Check to the Career. And if the Assemblies should at the 
same time decline giving any more annual Supports, and 
leave all Governors to their Appointments out of the Revenue, 
giving bountifully to a good Governor at the End of his Administration, and leaving bad ones to be rewarded by their 
Masters ; perhaps by this means some of that Influence with 
Governors might be retained, which induces them to treat the 
People with Equity and Moderation. But if our People will, 
by consuming such Commodities, purchase and pay for their 
Fetters, who that sees them so shackled, will think they 
deserve either Redress or Pity. Methinks that in drinking 
Tea, a true American, reflecting that by every Cup he contributed to the Salaries, Pensions, and Rewards of the Enemies 
and Persecutors of his Country, would be half choak'd at the 
Thought, and find no Quantity of Sugar sufficient to make 
the nauseous Draught go down. 
</p><p>
I hope your Health is restored, and that your valuable Life 
will be long continued, for the Benefit of your Friends, Family, 
and Country. 
</p><p>
With sincere and great Esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
Your affectionate and most obedient Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
