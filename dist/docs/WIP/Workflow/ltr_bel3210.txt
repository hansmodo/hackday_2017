MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Since my last, the enemy have, very unexpectedly, 
brought over the ships mentioned in the inclosed 
paper. It has been thought there was not water 
enough for a sixty-four gun ship. Before they came 
into the harbour, it was determined to form a line of battle across the channel, with our ships, to act in 
conjunction with Fort Moultrie ; but afterwards, as the 
enemy were so vastly superior to our force, it was 
thought best to remove our ships up to the town in 
Cooper River, and land their heavy cannon and men. 
We are endeavouring to obstruct the channel from the town to Shute's Folly. If we should succeed, great 
good will result from the measure, as thereby we 
shall prevent the enemy from running up that river, 
and cutting off our communication with the country 
on the east. 
</p><p>
The enemy are extending their works on Ashley 
River, from the mouth of Wappoo, with a design to 
cover their stores, which they can land near the first 
work, at the mouth of the creek, and remove them a 
mile or two across land to the head of another creek, 
which empties into the Ashley, where they have a 
work also, which is opposite a good landing on this 
side. I think they will throw their troops across 
above, take post at this landing, and then transport 
their stores, which will save them a very long land 
carriage. 
</p><p>
I lament, most sincerely, that, from the want of a 
sufficient power, we cannot oppose their passing this 
river, which might easily be effected, and oblige the 
enemy to take a circuit of forty miles. General Woodford is not yet arrived. By his letter of the 
6th instant, he informs me that his troops would 
leave Petersburg the day after. His numbers, by 
some means or other, are greatly reduced. By his 
return, he has only seven hundred and thirty-seven 
fit for action. 
</p><p>
General Scott informs me that he is coming on 
without the remainder of his troops. Want of clothing 
is the cause. A few of them have been persuaded to 
take care of General Woodford's baggage. Many of 
the North Carolina militia, whose times have expired, 
leave us to-day. They cannot be persuaded to re 
main longer, though the enemy are in our neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
General Mclntosh received, a few days since, a re 
solve of Congress, founded on a letter from the Governor of Georgia, and one from the Speaker of the 
Assembly of that State, purporting that he had lost 
the confidence of the people; in which resolve he is 
suspended from acting in the Southern department. 
I have not only to lament the loss of so good an officer, but that Congress have so suddenly come into a resolution, which must wound the feelings of an 
old servant of the United States, and who, by the 
war, is reduced from a state of great affluence to 
that but a little removed from beggary. He has the 
command of the country militia of this State, now in garrison. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with the highest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
