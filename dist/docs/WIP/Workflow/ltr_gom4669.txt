Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Enclosed herewith you will find my account up to the first 
of last month. I did not send it sooner, because I wished to 
comprise therein those of the Consulates, none of which are 
come forward. I shall, therefore, write to them on the subject. You will observe, that I charge therein twenty-four 
livres, given to an American sea officer. He appeared to be, 
and really was, in very great distress, so that I could not 
avoid giving what I conceived needful to carry him to the 
nearest seaport. He has since applied to me again repeatedly, but he has been refused all farther aid. 
</p><p>
You will find also a charge for engraving passports. 
This became necessary, because from the time of my arrival, 
or very shortly after it, the difficulties in the way of travelling 
were so great, that people, with all the formalities required by 
law, could scarcely get along ; and among the municipalities a 
handsome piece of paper, with a seal to it, had much more 
effect than the ministerial signatures. If, however, either or 
both of these charges be deemed improper, let them be re 
charged to me. 
</p><p>
I sent out more pamphlets than those I have brought to 
account, because, when an opportunity offered, I put up not 
only those I had procured for your office, but all others which 
were at hand, and which having been originally purchased for 
my own information, I did not think it proper to charge them 
to the United States. 
</p><p>
I also enclose herein a table of the value of the Assignats, 
compared with specie, for one year ending with the last of 
June. During the month of July, they may be stated at 
about twenty per cent ; but upon that value, as well as on 
those contained in the table, it is necessary to observe first, 
that the fluctuations of exchange are great ; so that, to deter 
mine with precision the value requires information, which I 
believe it is impossible to obtain. For instance, louis d ors 
have sometimes borne a premium of above five per cent 
compared with silver ; and at other times have gone at par. 
Nay, this change has taken place from one day to another ; 
and on the same day there has been a difference of above five 
per cent in the price of specie. It would be necessary, therefore, to know at which of two such different prices, the greatest sum was negotiated ; and also, in other cases, whether the 
principal negotiations were in gold or silver. At first sight, 
indeed, it might be supposed that the metal of highest price 
was the one principally bought ; but I am assured that this 
rule did not hold good ; and as for the reason why it did not 
hold, we must seek it in the trick of the day, or the lie of the 
day. Sometimes, also, in the searchings and plunderings. 
</p><p>
But, secondly, this table, however accurate it might be, 
would not, I conceive, form a proper standard on which to 
proceed in our custom houses, because the value of commodities has been by no means dependent on that of the assignats. 
The prices have considerably increased, but not proportionately ; and the particular increase depends on the article, so that 
a history of each would be necessary. Bread, although sup 
plies have constantly been brought from abroad, has been 
kept very nearly to the old standard. Flesh is more than 
double. Vegetables four, or five, or six, times as dear as 
formerly. Merchandizes for export have not risen in proportion. Wines and brandies were getting up rapidly, but the 
war damped them. They took afterwards a great rise from 
the demand of the armies, so that the low Burgundies were 
getting up to the price of the high almost. 
</p><p>
I am not enough acquainted with the subject to go into the 
needful details, and only say thus much, to show that merchandizes did not depend for price on the same principles 
as the precious metals, since these last were purchased by 
the Nation for its armies, by the emigrants for their support, 
and by people in general, as a resource in the moment when 
paper should be decried. 
</p><p>
Lastly, the price of specie did not go on regular principles 
of apportionment or comparison with the mass of paper. In 
the months of May or June, I 792, it rose, because the old 
Ministers having purchased large sums of specie, their successors found that they could dispense with immediate supplies. 
In July, August, and September, notwithstanding the political 
events, it was kept tolerably steady by the stockjobbing maDoeuvres, backed with the sums in the Treasury, and also by 
the fear of plunder after the tenth of August ; for many were 
plundered during the visites domiciliares, and it was given out 
by authority, that specie would be taken by force, and paper 
given in exchange. The benefits, which those at the centre 
of these operations expected to derive^ were prevented by the 
great, and unlocked for, successes of the French arms in October and November. In the end of November, and in the 
beginning of December, the proportion was about seventy-three per cent, being higher than is stated in the table, be 
cause in November, the exchange was lower in the beginning, 
and in December at the end of the month 5 wherefore the 
average of each is diminished. 
</p><p>
In the month of December, the trial of the King, the probability that he would be put to death, the consequences naturally resulting from that catastrophe, the certainty of another, and 
more serious campaign, the situation of the armies, and, in fine, 
the abundance of the Assignats, when the cold weather forced 
back presumptuous hope into the region of austere reflection, 
brought down the exchange to about sixty per cent. In January it was tolerably steady at about fifty-eight, and in February at about fifty-six. The paper during this period went on 
in its natural course of gentle decay. In the beginning of 
March it was still at about fifty-six ; but the successes of the 
enemy shortly after reduced it to forty-eight. In the beginning of April, it was brought down to about forty-four; so that 
in one month's time it lost about one fifth of its value. From 
that time it went on gradually again, being about forty-two at 
the end of April, and then rapidly, so as to be about thirty in 
the end of June, consequently the degradation monthly, for 
those two months, was about one sixth each. 
</p><p>
But in July it took a terrible plunge, viz. from thirty to 
twenty, being one third of the value taken off in a few 
days. This was owing, in part, to a view of public affairs 
both foreign and domestic, and partly to stockjobbing manoeuvres carried on by authority, with a view to ruin the stockjobbers. These manoeuvres had, in part, their effect, for having 
forced the exchange below its natural level, it rose towards the 
end of the month, and, of course, those who speculated on a 
farther fall were taken in. The prime movers did, indeed, 
expect a wonderful rise, from the taking out of circulation 
about 1,700,000,000 of livres, on which the king's head is 
impressed ; but this stroke was broken, by the necessity of 
confining it to one half the sum, being the large Assignats, because 
the small ones dispersed in the hands of the Sans Culottes 
might have deprived the government of the support of its 
friends. 
</p><p>
But, besides this, the stroke was in itself a bad one, because 
it injures the paper more by depreciating its credit, than it 
benefits what remains by lessening the mass, even could the 
mass be thereby lessened, which it is not, for all the effect is to 
give a different direction to the proscribed paper in those districts which respect the decree. Many people persist in believing that the Assignats, with that condemned impression, are 
better than the others, and even that their value is increased 
by the decree, which, drawing a line of division between 
them, leaves the future government at liberty to annul the circulation now favored with an appearance of justice. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that men calculate upon the dissolution of 
the present system as on a datum, although the period, in 
which it is to arrive, is considered as uncertain. It is far from 
being impossible that they reckon without their host ; but the 
opinion is as important as the thing in respect to a species of 
money, whose value depends on opinion. Another circumstance, which should have been taken into consideration, and 
which was not duly weighed, is, that the value of the mass 
of paper depends on the course in the capital, and there the 
new Assignats must be rather more plentiful than the old ; of 
course destroying the old cannot do much good to the new. 
And, besides, the holders of the old, as well as the new, being 
in effect the great money dealers, can by their united efforts 
apportion the value to each as they please, and their common 
interest will excite a common action ; and they have over the 
government an advantage, which no power of legislation can 
compensate, because they act with the paper in circulation, 
and the government with that which goes to increase the circulation, and which, of course, lessens the value which they wish 
to increase. 
</p><p>
From all this I conclude, that the paper must go on perishing day by day, and, like other consumptive patients, be alike 
weakened by the doctor and the disease. On the whole, Sir, 
to return to your original object, I believe the safest way in 
America, and the most equitable, would be to value articles imported from this country at the prices of <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a>. I am, &ic.
