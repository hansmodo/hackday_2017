Dear Sir, 
The delay which has hitherto occurred in transmitting to you the inclosed proceedings, will be ascribed, 
I hope, to its true causes; one of which will be 
found in my last letter, and the other, in the daily expectation of Mr. Ross's visit to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, in 
pursuance of our resolution of the 8th of December, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1785'>1785</a>. You may possibly be surprised, that a work, 
which has already expended a considerable sum of 
money, should be delineated in so few words as the 
copies now sent contain. But I beg leave to inform 
you, that we have detailed, in the execution, almost 
the whole of the resolutions. 
</p><p>
For example ; we have procured the ascertainment 
of a precise point to which the navigation is to be 
extended. Crow's Ferry being now established as 
such. We are authorized to borrow money at six 
per cent., and to extend the number of shares. Inexperienced as we were, we yet conceived that our 
duty called for an examination of the ground between <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> and Westham. The difficulties seemed greater than we at first apprehended. As soon 
as the report is prepared by a more skilful hand 
than we affect to be, it shall be forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
The old books of subscriptions are not complete, as 
I supposed when I wrote to you last. Seven shares 
are still unoccupied, of which we shall reserve the 
five which you wished for yourself It was impossible to engage any other labor than that of blacks; 
and this necessity has obliged us to bring the laborers into actual service earlier, perhaps, than we 
should have done in the present state of our imperfect knowledge of canals. But the subscribers would 
have been dissatisfied, had we not begun in the 
course of this year ; and negroes, you know. Sir, 
must be hired in January at farthest. 
</p><p>
Concerning our progress in this great business, our 
plans, and future expectations, we beg you to inquire 
of James Harris, our Manager, who will deliver this 
letter. He is a quaker, of good character as a man, 
and a mechanic, formed by nature for the management of water, when applied to mills. He has added 
nothing to his natural turn by the view of any great 
works. We therefore request, if you see no impropriety, that you would give him such a passport to 
the Potomac works, as will enable him to get a 
thorough insight into what is there projected. You 
perceive that Mr. Ross was originally intended to be 
sent to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> for this purpose ; but he has 
been, for a length of time, under a severe disease, 
and is not yet restored. The office of subordinate 
Manager, mentioned in one of the resolutions, does 
not exist ; it being swallowed up in that of Mr. Harris. It is not improbable that Mr. Harris may 
continue his journey to the Susquehanna Canal. If 
so, we shall thank you to furnish him with a certificate of being employed by the James River Company, in any manner which may appear most likely 
to introduce him into an acquaintance with those of 
that scheme who may be most intelligent. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear Su, I have written to you, at the 
desire of my brethren in office, a tedious account of 
our operations. Permit me, therefore, to return to 
the contemplation of private friendship, and to assure 
you that I am always, 
</p><p>
With the greatest respect and esteem, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
