Sir, 
</p><p>
My letter of the 7th ultimo, covering the returns 
of the army, I hope has been safely delivered. Since 
which I have been duly honored with your Excellency's favors of the 23d of April and 22d of May. 
The troops have been so badly clothed, and the season is so very hot, that many of the soldiery have 
been seized with fevers, which renders them unfit for 
service, although it has by no means proved mortal. 
I have procured, with the aid of the Executive of 
this State, materials for a check shirt, a pair of overalls, and a coatee, for each of them, which will alleviate their distress until the supplies from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> arrive. 
</p><p>
On the 7th instant, I changed the position of the 
army, in hopes of finding one more healthy. I have 
taken post on the south side of Ashley River, seven miles below Bacon's Bridge, and fifteen from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. The ground is high and dry ; the water is good ; 
and it has the appearance of the most healthy place 
this country affords. We have been daily in expectation of hearing of the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. It is 
an event which I believe has been determined on for 
some time past. The people of this country have 
their expectations raised, and are sanguine in their 
hopes that <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will be speedily abandoned. 
There are some preparations on which their opinions are founded ; but I must confess, they seem to be 
rather contracting; their works than abandoning; the place. The situation of their troops at the Quarterhouse, they find so very unhealthy, that they will be 
under the necessity of leaving it. They have advanced their works one mile on the neck, to which 
they will retire. 
</p><p>
The enemy are so well informed of the want of 
energy and exertion in the States, that I am apprehensive they will withdraw part of their troops, leaving a small garrison to be held in constant readiness 
to evacuate, whenever they find a combined attack 
meditated against them. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Greene joins me in returning the most sincere 
thanks for your and Mrs. Washington's attention, and 
we beg you will accept our best wishes for your happiness. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect 
esteem and respect your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. The copy of a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a>, 
and the returns of the army, will accompany this 
letter.
