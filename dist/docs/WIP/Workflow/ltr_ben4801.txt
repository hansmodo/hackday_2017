DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received your kind Favour of January i by <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, to whom I should be glad to render any Service 
here. I wrote to you some Weeks since in Answer to yours of 
July and November, expressing my Sentiments without the 
least Reserve on Points that require free Discussion, as I know 
I can confide in your Prudence not to hurt my Usefulness here, 
by making me more obnoxious than I must necessarily be 
from that known Attachment to the American Interest, which 
my Duty as well as Inclination demands of me. 
</p><p>
In the same Confidence I send you the inclosed Extract 
from my Journal, containing a late Conference between the 
Secretary l and your Friend, in which you will see a little of 
his Temper : It is one of the many Instances of his Behaviour 
and Conduct, that have given me the very mean Opinion I 
entertain of his Abilities and Fitness for his Station. His 
Character is Conceit, Wrongheadedness, Obstinacy, and 
Passion. Those, who would speak most favourably of him, 
allow all this ; they only add, that he is an honest Man, and 
means well. If that be true, as perhaps it may, I wish him a 
better Place, where only Honesty and Well-meaning are required, and where his other Qualities can do no harm. 
Had the War taken place, I have reason to believe he would 
have been removed. He had, I think, some Apprehensions 
of it himself at the Time I was with him. I hope, however, 
that our Affairs will not much longer be perplex'd and embarass'd by his perverse and senseless Management. I have 
since heard, that his Lordship took great Offence at some of 
my last Words, which he calls extreamly rude and abusive. 
He assured a Friend of mine, that they were equivalent to 
telling him to his Face, that the Colonies could expect neither 
Favour nor Justice during his Administration. I find he did 
not mistake me. 
</p><p>
It is true, as you have heard, that some of my Letters to 
America have been echo'd back hither; but that has not been 
the Case with any that were written to you. Great Umbrage 
was taken, but chiefly by Lord Hillsborough, who was disposed before to be angry with me, and therefore the Inconvenience was the less; and, whatever the Consequences are 
of his Displeasure, putting all my Offences together, I must 
bear them as well as I can. Not but that, if there is to be 
War between us, I shall do my best to defend myself and 
annoy my Adversary, little regarding the story of the Earthen 
Pot and Brazen Pitcher. One encouragement I have, the 
knowledge, that he is not a whit better lik'd by his Colleagues 
in the Ministry, than he is by me, that he cannot probably 
continue where he is much longer, and that he can scarce be 
succeeded by anybody, who will not like me the better for his 
having been at Variance with me. 
</p><p>
Pray continue Writing to me, as you find Opportunity. 
Your candid, clear, and well written Letters, be assured, are 
of great use. With the highest Esteem, I am, my dear 
Friend, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
