My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am still unable to say any thing decisive relative to the 
objects of my mission. Appearances continue to be singularly favourable, but appearances merit only a certain 
degree of circumspect reliance. The delays occasioned by 
the new arrangement of the ministry cannot be of long 
continuance. Circumstances must soon constrain them to 
form some ultimate system relative to the United States ; 
and although I have much reason to hope it will be favourable to our wishes, yet I confess I am not without apprehensions, that certain points not by us to be yielded, will 
occasion difficulties hard to surmount. Personally, I have 
every reason to - be satisfied, and officially, I have as yet no 
reason to complain. 
</p><p>
Shortly after my arrival, I dined with <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. 
The cabinet ministers were present, but not a single foreigner. On Monday next I am to dine with the lordchancellor, and on next Friday with Mr. Pitt. I mention 
these facts to explain what I mean by favourable appearances. I think it best that they should remain unmentioned 
for the present, and they make no part of my communications to Mr. Randolph or others. This is not the season 
for such communications ; they may be misinterpreted, 
though not by you. 
</p><p>
I fear the posts may labour, but they must not be left. 
We must not make a delusive settlement ; that would disunite our peop-c, and leave seeds of discord to germinate. 
I will do every thing that prudence and integrity may dictate or permit. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to accommodate rather than dispute ; 
and if this plan should fail, decent and firm representations 
must conclude the business of my mission. As vet, I do 
not regret any step I have taken. I wish I may be able to 
say the same at the conclusion. 
</p><p>
Yours, affectionately, 
</p><p>
