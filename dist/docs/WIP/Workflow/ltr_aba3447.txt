Well, my dear son, South Carolina has behaved as 
your father always said she would. The consequence to us, personally, is, that we retire from 
public life. For myself and family, I have few regrets. At my age, and with my bodily infirmities, 
I shall be happier at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. Neither my habits, 
nor my education or inclinations, have led me to an 
expensive style of living, so that on that score I have 
little to mourn over. If I did not rise with dignity, 
I can at least fall with ease, which is the more difficult task. I wish your father's circumstances were 
not so limited and circumscribed, as they must be, 
because he cannot indulge himself in those improvements upon his farm, which his inclination 
leads him to, and which would serve to amuse him, 
and contribute to his health. I feel not any resentment against those who are coming into power, and 
only wish the future administration of the government may be as productive of the peace, happiness, 
and prosperity of the nation, as the two former ones 
have been. I leave to time the unfolding of a drama. I leave to posterity to reflect upon the times 
past ; and I leave them characters to contemplate. 
My own intention is to return to <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> as soon as 
I conveniently can ; I presume in the month of January.

Governor Davie arrived yesterday with the treaty. 
Judge Ellsworth was landed in England for the 
benefit of his health. The public curiosity will be 
soon satisfied. Peace with France, a revenue increased beyond any former years, our prospects 
brightening upon every side. What must be the 
thoughts and the reflections of those, who, calling 
themselves Federalists, have placed their country in 
a situation full of dangers and perils ; who have 
wantonly thrown away the blessings Heaven seemed 
to have in reserve for them ? The defection of 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has been the source. That defection was 
produced by the intrigues of two men. One of 
them sowed the seeds of discontent and division 
amongst the Federalists, and the other seized the 
lucky moment of mounting into power upon the 
shoulders of Jefferson. The triumph of the Jacobins 
is immoderate, and the Federalists deserve it. It is 
an old and a just proverb, " Never halloo until you are 
out of the woods." So completely have they gulled 
one another by their Southern promises, which have 
no more faith, when made to Northern men, than 
lovers' vows.

I have not heard from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> since I wrote you last. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Thomas, 
</p><p>
Your ever affectionate mother, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
