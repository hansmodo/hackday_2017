SIR: 
</p><p>
Since you left me, Mr. Dewees has shown me the bill for the goods 
you mentioned to me this morning. You will procure as much rough 
rice as will pay the amount, giving a receipt for it on the public ac 
count, and shall be glad you would send the goods to Capt. Roux. 
You will give what you think is a reasonable profit. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
