Sir, 
</p><p>
I have written repeatedly to Congress, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='co-worker'>Mr. Morris</a>, and enclosed my accounts ; as I have not been honored 
with any answer, I fear either that my letters may have been intercepted, or that the multiplicity of business has prevented. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay has been here some days ; he has looked into my accounts with the public, and I have given him a 
copy of them, which he has promised me to send by the most safe conveyance, and does me the favor of enclosing 
this to you, which is simply to request that you would take, or procure to be taken, such measures as will bring on a 
final and decisive settlement of my accounts. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay tells me, that he has no orders on the subject, and that it lies in your department. I have, therefore, 
taken the liberty to address myself to you. 
</p><p>
Mr Barclay, after viewing my accounts, proposed that auditors, or arbitrators, should be named at Paris, to audit 
and settle the accounts. I have not the least objection to this, nor shall I have any against any person, or persons, 
named by Congress, provided they are such as have a competent knowledge of accounts, and are impartial. I am 
willing, either to nominate one part of them, or to leave the whole nomination to <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, as Congress shall prefer, 
or to submit my accounts to the examination of Mr Barclay alone, provided that he be empowered to take the opinion 
of disinterested persons on the spot, as to any dubious or uncertain articles, and to make a final close of the affair. 
</p><p>
You will, by exerting your interest to bring this affair to a settlement, do, as I conceive, material service to the public, 
and certainly lay the utmost obligations on one, who has the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, etc. 
</p><p>
