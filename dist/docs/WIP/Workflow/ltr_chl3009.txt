MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the happiness to congratulate you on a very signal success (if I may not call it a victory), 
which we have gained over the mercenary instruments of the British tyrant. I shall not trouble you with a detail of their manoeuvres or delays, but defer it to another time, when I have more leisure to 
write, and you to attend. Let it suffice, that having lost an opportunity (such as I hope will never again present itself) of taking the town, which, on my arrival, was utterly defenceless, the Commodore thought proper, on Friday last, with, his whole squadron, consisting of two fifties, six frigates, and a bomb (the 
rates of which you will see in the inclosed list), to attack our fort on Sullivan's Island. 
</p><p>
They dropped their anchors about eleven in the 
forenoon, at the distance of three or four yards be 
fore the front battery. I was myself, at this time, 
in a boat, endeavouring to make the Island; but the 
wind and tide being violently against us, drove us 
on the main. They immediately commenced the most 
furious fire I ever heard or saw. I confess I was in 
pain, from the little confidence I reposed in our 
troops ; the officers being all boys, and the men raw 
recruits. What augmented my anxiety was, that we 
had no bridge finished for retreat, or communication ; 
and the creek, or cove, which separates it from the 
continent, is near a mile wide. I had received, like 
wise, intelligence that their land troops intended at 
the same time to land and assault, I never in my 
life felt myself so uneasy; and what added to my 
uneasiness was, that I knew our stock of ammunition 
was miserably low. I had once thoughts of ordering 
the commanding officer to spike his guns, and, when 
his ammunition was spent, to retreat with as little loss 
as possible. However, I thought proper previously to 
send to town for a fresh supply, if it could possibly 
})e procured, and ordered my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Byrd, 
(who is a lad of magnanimous courage) to pass over 
in a small canoe, and report the state of the spirit 
of the garrison. If it had been low, I should have 
abandoned all thoughts of defence. His report was 
flattering. I then determined to maintain the post at all risks, and passed the creek or cove, in a small 
boat, in order to animate the garrison in proprid persona ; but I found they had no occasion for such encouragement. 
</p><p>
They were pleased with my visit, and assured me 
they never would abandon the post but with their 
lives. The cool courage they displayed astonished 
and enraptured me, for I do assure you, my dear 
General, I never experienced a hotter fire. Twelve 
full hours it was continued without intermission. The 
noble fellows, who were mortally wounded, conjured 
their brethren never to abandon the standard of li 
berty. Those who lost their limbs deserted not their 
posts. Upon the whole, they acted like Romans in 
the third century. However, our works were so 
good and solid, that we lost but few; only ten killed 
on the spot, and twenty-two wounded, seven of whom 
lost their legs or arms. The loss of the enemy, as 
you will perceive by the inclosed list, was very 
great. As I send a detail to the Congress, I shall 
not trouble you with a duplicate ; but, before I fin 
ish, you must suffer me to recommend to your esteem, friendship, and patronage my (though young) 
Aids-de-camp, Byrd and Morris, whose good sense, 
integrity, activity, and valor, promise to their country 
a most fruitful crop of essential services. Mr. Jenifer, 
of Maryland, a gentleman of fortune, and not of the 
age when the blood of men flows heroically, has 
shown not less spirit than these youngsters. I may 
venture to recommend in these high terms, because 
the trial was severe. 
</p><p>
Colonel Moultrie, who commanded the garrison, deserves the highest honors. The manifest intention 
of the enemy was to land, at the same time the 
ships began to fire, their whole regulars on the east end of the Island. Twice they attempted it, and twice 
were repulsed by a Colonel Thompson, of the South 
Carolina Rangers, in conjunction with a body of 
North Carolina regulars. Upon the whole, the South 
and North Carolina troops and Virginia Rifle battalion we have here, are admirable soldiers. The enemy 
is now returned to their old station on this side the 
bar. What their intention is, I cannot divine. One 
of the five deserters, who came over to us this day, 
is the most intelligent fellow I ever met with. The 
accounts of their particular loss and situation are his, 
and I think they may be depended upon. 
</p><p>
For God's sake, my dear General, urge the congress to furnish me with a thousand cavalry. With 
a thousand cavalry I could insure the safety of these 
Southern Provinces ; and without cavalry, I can an 
swer for nothing. I proposed a scheme in Virginia 
for raising a body almost without any expense. The 
scheme was relished by the gentlemen of Virginia, but 
I am told the project was censured by some members 
of the Congress, on the principle that a military servant should not take the liberty to propose any 
thing. This opinion I sincerely subscribe to, when 
our distance from the sovereign is so small, and the 
danger so remote, as to admit of proposing, deliberating, resolving, and approving ; but when a General is 
at a vast distance, and the enemy close to him, I 
humbly conceive that it is his duty to propose and 
adopt any thing, without other authority than the 
public safety. From want of this species of troops, 
we had infallibly lost this Capital, but the dilatoriness and stupidity of the enemy saved us. 
</p><p>
I this instant learn that the Commodore is fixing 
buoys on the bar, which indicates an intention of 
quitting the place. It is probable that they will bend 
their course to Hampton, or Chesapeake Bay. 
</p><p>
I am extremely happy, dear General, that you are 
at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, for their counsels sometimes lack a 
little military electricity. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the Adjutant-General to send you 
a return; I mean only a return of the strength of 
this place. I suppose it will be imperfect, for it is 
an Herculean labor, to a South Carolina officer, to 
make any detail. God bless you, my dear General, 
and crown you with success, as I am, 
</p><p>
Most entirely and affectionately, yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. I am made quite happy by the resolution of Congress to keep Canada. Had it been relinquished, all would have been lost.
