My dear Sir 
</p><p>
The mail of this morning brought me your favor of the 28th inst. the business part of which was immediately arranged. 
</p><p>
I regret, my dear Sir, this controversy as much as you can 
&amp; would gladly have shunned it, but believing that it is safer 
for the country to have no Bank than to have it subject to 
political influences, it was impossible not to resist these pre 
tensions from so many quarters to interfere in its administration. In doing this I am not conscious of having gone 
beyond the limits of a necessary self defence; and no one 
would regret more than I would, if I thought you right in 
believing that the Board had persisted in imputing to Mr Ingham a purpose which he has disavowed. But what the 
Board imputed to him &amp; what has he disavowed? He has in so 
many words, sent to the Board the views of the administration as to the mode in which they ought to choose and dismiss their officers saying that it is his "high public duty" to 
communicate it &amp; their "very high obligation" to conform 
to it. All that the Board have answered is, that he had no 
right to give advice and that if he had, the advice is bad. 
They have never imputed to him a design to acquire undue 
influence they have only said that his theory would lead 
to it. They have never imputed to him a connexion with the 
movements of other people they have only cited these 
movements in illustration of the danger of his theory. I hope most sincerely that he has no such connexion &amp; would be 
the first to render justice to him whenever an opportunity 
occurs. For really he ought not, and I am sure will not ascribe 
to us the least unkindness toward him. To show you the 
temper in which this whole matter has been conducted, I will 
mention a simple fact. The only political character in the 
Board is <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr. Sergeant</a> and he was a member of the Committee 
to whom Mr. Inghams first letter was referred. But so fearful 
was I lest any political bias should interfere, that I would not 
communicate with <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr. Sergeant</a> nor was he consulted until 
during my absence his professional opinion was asked about 
the removal of the Pension Office, he being the standing counsel of the Bank. Moreover of the five gentlemen composing 
that Committee, two were the political friends of Gen'l  Jackson. All our predispositions therefore were kindly, and it 
was not until the feelings &amp; the spirit of the Board were wounded, that they were compelled to vindicate the independence of the Institution. 
</p><p>
Having done this, all feeling has subsided &amp; it will remain for the Secretary himself to restore the relations of the Bank &amp; the 
Treasury to their former friendly footing. He has only to say that we have misapprehended him that he did not claim 
a right to interfere with the concerns of the Bank and had nothing to do with the movement, of these other people 
and I should immediately say, as I have no doubt the Board would say, that the explanation was very agreeable that 
we regretted any misapprehension, and any expression on the part of the Board which might be considered as applying 
to a supposed design to interfere would of course be inapplicable on the present occasion. This I think he might do with 
great propriety and I am sure that he would be met in the most friendly temper. He ought to do it, because I think he 
began this whole business. My impression is that he would have done well to say in answer to Mr Woodbury that he 
should apply to the Bank and not to the Treasury there being a peculiar awkwardness in any interference on the part 
of the Sec'y . Not having done so he has become inevitably blended with these other movements of a parcel of intriguers, 
all participation in which, he owes it to himself to disclaim. No one will be better pleased than I shall be at his doing so. 
I had intended on my return from the North to explain to the Sec'y the whole machinery of this cabal of which he was 
to have been made the unconscious instrument &amp; to put him on his guard against similar machinations in future. But the 
tone of his second letter made me abstain from any thing which might be misconstrued into an acknowledgement that 
he was entitled to any such explanations. . . .
