Sm,

Yesterday evening, the Congress completed the business of the Medical Department, and on so large 
and liberal an establishment that we may rationally 
expect the most beneficial effects will flow from it. 
Every encouragement is given to gentlemen of skill 
and reputation in that art to enter into our army ; 
and a variety of regulations adopted to carry the 
plan more effectually into execution. As I have the 
honor of inclosing the resolves on this subject, I beg 
leave to refer your attention to them. 
</p><p>
It is with particular pleasure I transmit the resolution of Congress directing monuments to be erected 
to the memory of Major-General Warren and Brigadier-General Mercer. Every mark of distinction shown 
to those illustrious men, who offer up their lives and 
liberty for the happiness of mankind, reflects the 
highest honor upon those who pay the tribute, and, 
by holding up to others the prospects of fame and 
immortality, will animate them to tread in the same 
path. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
