DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 23d instant, 
inclosing one to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, which I immediately forwarded to him. I am sensible that, however 
distressing the situation of our western frontier may 
be, your Excellency has taken every method to afford it security that is in your power, consistent 
with the general good of the service. I would not 
wish, therefore, that any representation of mine should 
occasion a diminution of your present force ; and, as 
Colonel Graham's regiment is composed of men who 
are intimately acquainted with every part of the 
country between the enemy's lines and yours, and 
may be of peculiar service where they now are, I 
would beg leave to submit to your Excellency's further consideration, whether it would not be most advisable to continue it with you at present; in which 
case, I will endeavour to call out a larger proportion 
of the militia for the defence of the frontiers. This, 
I think, the militia ought cheerfully to submit to, as, 
if they were not required for that service, it would 
be but reasonable that they should march to reenforce the army under your Excellency's immediate 
command. 
</p><p>
I have already ordered out one fourth part of the 
militia of Orange and Ulster to the western frontier 
of those counties, who will amount to near six hundred men, and have directed them to take their stations so as to secure the most important passes leading into the settlements. If they do this, and are 
vigilant, I trust that part of the country will experience a degree of safety. In addition to this, I have 
issued positive orders to Brigadier-General Ten Broeck, 
and the commanding officers of the several regiments 
in Tryon county, to detach one fourth of their militia 
(such regiments as may be necessary for the safety 
of the northern frontier excepted) for the protection 
of the western frontier in that quarter, and to act 
under and assist Colonel Butler in any offensive operations which may be thought necessary to be carried on by him against the enemy. 
</p><p>
Colonel Butler (whose march, on receiving the intelligence I lately transmitted to your Excellency, I 
wished to be hastened) was this morning at New 
Windsor, and will proceed directly to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and 
from thence to Schoharie or Cherry Valley, as General Stark (whose department he will then be in) 
shall direct; and, if joined by Alden's regiment, and 
the detachment of militia which I have ordered out, 
they will form a pretty respectable force in that 
quarter. In the mean time, if I should receive any 
new intelligence that may render its augmentation 
necessary, it shall immediately be communicated to 
your Excellency. I propose, if nothing extraordinary 
happens to prevent it, to do myself the pleasure of 
waiting on your Excellency next week. I am, with 
the highest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
