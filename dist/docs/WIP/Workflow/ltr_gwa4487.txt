Sir, 
</p><p>
Having been made acquainted by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with the design of the Count de Grasse to 
come to this coast with his fleet, I cannot forbear expressing my ardent wishes, that a body of land forces 
might also attend this naval armament ; for I am apprehensive, that such a decided superiority of men may 
not be drawn together by the time Count de Grasse 
will be here, as to insure our success against the enemy's most important posts. His continuance in these 
seas may also be limited to a short period ; and the 
addition of a respectable corps of troops from the West 
Indies would, in all human probability, terminate the 
matter very soon in our favor. 
</p><p>
If these should likewise be your sentiments, and if 
this plan should not interfere with the intentions and 
interest of his Most Christian Majesty elsewhere, I entreat your Excellency, by the first good conveyance, to 
represent the propriety and necessity of the measure 
to the commanders in the West Indies ; that by one 
great and decisive stroke the enemy may be expelled 
from the continent, and the independence of America 
established at the approaching negotiation. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
