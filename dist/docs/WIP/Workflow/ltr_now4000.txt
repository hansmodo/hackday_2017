Sir, 
</p><p>
For your favour of the 31st ult. with the enclosed bill, 
be pleased to accept my most grateful acknowledgments. 
The interest you have manifested in my labours, and the 
liberality accompanying it, are the more acceptable, as they 
have been unsolicited. 
</p><p>
It is not improbable that some ill-founded apprehensions 
that I might attempt changes of orthography, have had their 
effect in preventing subscriptions ; but there are several 
other causes. 
</p><p>
On the subject of orthography, gentlemen might have 
been easy, as any considerable changes must prevent the 
sale and use of a work of this sort, and they might rationally conclude that I would not put myself to an immense 
trouble and expense, to write a book which would not find 
purchasers. 
</p><p>
My plan is different from any thing before attempted. I 
have examined and collated the radical words in twenty 
languages, including the seven Asiatic languages, or rather 
dialects of the Assyrian stock. This will enable me to 
explain many things in the English language which have 
hitherto been obscure. Indeed, this research has opened a 
field entirely new, and it is probable will lead to many 
important discoveries, not only in the origin and affinity of 
languages, but in history sacred and profane. 
</p><p>
The price of the work cannot be known at present ; but 
if I live to complete it, I shall not only present you a copy, 
but hold myself answerable to refund the principal of the 
sum advanced. 
</p><p>
With gratitude and respect, I am sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
