MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I DINED on Monday at the Presidents with young La Fayette and his preceptor, tutor or friend, whatever 
they call him, whose name is Frestel. I asked them 
with Mr. Lear to breakfast with me this morning and 
they agreed to come ; but last evening, Mr. Lear 
came with a message from the President to ask my 
opinion whether it would be advisable for the young 
gentleman, in the present circumstances of his father 
and mother and whole family, and considering his 
own tender years, to accept invitations and mingle in 
society ? Whether it would not too much interrupt 
his studies ? The youth and his friend had proposed 
these questions to the President and asked his advice, 
and expressed their own opinion, that retirement 
would be more advisable and more desirable. I agreed 
in opinion with the President and his guests, and as I 
had been the first who had invited them, at the President's request agreed to excuse them from accepting 
my invitation, that they might have it to say as a 
general apology that they had accepted none. There 
is a resemblance of father and mother in the young 
man. He is said to be studious and discreet. I hope 
he will live to become as respectable, and a more 
fortunate man than his father. You must have 
known him at five or six years of age, as well as his 
sister Anastasia, who is now with her parents.

The majority of the House of Representatives appear to be resolute to do nothing. In fact they have 
done nothing, and Mr. Giles boasts that he has a majority of ten determined to do nothing concerning the 
treaty with England. For my own part, I see no 
thing better than a crisis working up, which is to determine whether the constitution is to be brought to 
its end this year, or last a few longer. Not the tavern at Cowes, not the tavern at Harwich or at Helvoet, not the taverns at Nantes, L Qrient, and Brest, 
nor the calms, storms and contrary winds of a long 
voyage at sea, nothing but a journey through Spain, 
from <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> to Fontarabia is more tedious than the 
operations of our government under this constitution. 
</p><p>
I have received your's of April 1. You must get 
labor as reasonably as you can. But I almost wish 
we had let our homestead upon shares as well as the 
others. Another year I will, if I don t stay at home 
to take care of it. 
</p><p>
I am, affectionately, 
</p><p>
