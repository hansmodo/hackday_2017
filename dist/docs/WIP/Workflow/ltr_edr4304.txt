Sir, 
</p><p>
By the papers, which I have now the honor of returning to you, a "wish seems to be expressed that the President should recommend to Congress a digest 
of federal law, the appointment of one person only to such a service, and the selection of the author of those papers for that work. 
</p><p>
Whether, at a future day, when Congress shall appear to have neglected or slumbered over the subject, it may be expedient to rekindle their attention 
by a special recommendation, I pretend not to foresee. But, at present, it may be affirmed, that the House of Representatives possess, in the four last 
paragraphs of the notes to the Report on the Judicial System, an unequivocal suggestion of this very point. I therefore take the liberty of referring you to them. 
</p><p>
The suggestion, indeed, having come from a quarter which affects no title to the deference of that body, would undoubtedly be enforced by the solicitude of the Executive. But I have greatly erred, if 
I do not discover one characteristic of its conduct to be, not to throw any weight of personal or official character into measures, when no crisis demands it. 
If, then, the judicial system shall ever be revised, a federal code will stand prominent to view. If the judicial system shall not be revised, the federal code 
itself, as speaking more feebly to the particular interests and feelings of the House, can hardly expect 
to be more kindly treated. In the midst of the agitations, which have been or will be produced by deliberations on the war, the excise, the fisheries, the 
manufactures, the trade with Great Britain, the regulations of a mint, the militia, and many other topics of an animating cast, it will probably be asked, what 
peculiar and immediate urgency has the President remarked for inviting Congress to this abstract inquiry? 
Is there any danger of the two branches of the Legislature forgetting it, if it be important ? Especially 
as it is their direct duty to originate proposals for establishing or amending any system of laws. 
</p><p>
If, with a recommendation to this effect, another 
should be united, that a single person should execute 
the work, some uncommon sensations of surprise may 
be created. To qualify that single person, he ought 
to be accurately versed in the legislation and jurisprudence of every State. Nay, I am not certain that 
he ought not to know the very prejudices of each 
State. For it will not be enough to draw a line of 
partition between the Federal and State Governments, 
without having some regard to the temper of the 
latter. The necessary information can be contributed 
only by a number of able men, differently situated in 
the United States. These men can be found, and 
perhaps their reluctance may be overcome, and they 
may be induced to divide the Herculean task among 
them. But, even with a division of the responsibility, 
they ought to be diffident. 
</p><p>
Should it, however, be thought advisable, that the 
project should be now favored by a special communication from the President, and that a single person 
should be preferred, I certainly shall add nothing 
concerning any gentleman who may be so happy as 
to enjoy the highly-valuable endowments requisite for 
the fulfilment of the trust. But may it not be seriously apprehended, that the employment of a Judge 
in such a business, will excite a jealousy among those 
of his associates, who will not acknowledge their inferiority? Will it not warp him in all his decisions 
to those interpretations which he may have given of 
the Constitution? May he not rather lean in his 
judgments more to what he recollects to have been 
his intention in drawing a law, than obey the settled 
rules of construction? And who can say, let him be 
a Judge or Tvliat he will, that the glossary or comment, which he alone shall furnish, may not, insensibly, and contrary to his own honest mind, be tinctured with party views? 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, although I believe that the digest, 
will sooner or later be attempted, yet am I sure that 
the Legislature will not cordially patronize it, until 
its necessity shall be more obvious. I intended to 
have waited on you personally with this letter j but 
having been detained in Court during the whole 
week, I was unable to do so. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be. Sir, with a sincere, and 
affectionate attachment and respect, &c., 
</p><p>
