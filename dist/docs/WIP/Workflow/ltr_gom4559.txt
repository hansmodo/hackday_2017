Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter of the 
first instant. On the night of the fourth there was a hot press 
here, which has continued ever since, and the declared object 
is to compel Spain to atone for an insult offered to Great 
Britain, by capturing two vessels in Nootka Sound. Permit 
me to mention, incidentally, that it would not be amiss for the 
American captain, who was a witness of the whole transaction, to publish a faithful narrative. 
</p><p>
The general opinion here is, that Spain will submit, and that 
Spain only is the object of this armament. But I hold a very 
different faith. If Spain submits, she may as well give up her 
American dominions ; for the position advanced here is, that 
nations have a right to take possession of any territory unoccupied. Now, without noticing the inconsistency between this 
assertion, and those which preceded the war of <a href='/results.php?year=1755'>1755</a>, when 
France built Fort du Quesne upon ground unoccupied by 
British subjects, it cannot escape the most cursory observation, 
that the British, sitting down in the vicinity of Spanish settlements, will establish such a system of contraband traffic as 
must ruin the commerce of Cadiz, and the revenue now 
derived from it by the Spanish monarch. 
</p><p>
In former letters I have communicated in some measure my 
ideas upon the second opinion. I shall not therefore recapitulate them, but only in general notice, that the armament against 
Spain, should Spain shrink from the contest, will undoubtedly 
be sent to the Baltic, with decisive effect. You will observe 
also that the ministers count upon the nullity of France, of 
which I shall say a word presently. 
</p><p>
In consequence of the orders for impressing seamen, a number of Americans were taken, and the applications made for 
their relief were in some instances ineffectual. On the morning of the twelfth, Mr Cutting called to inform me, that he was appointed agent to several of the American masters of ships. 
I gave him my advice as to the best mode of proceeding, and 
particularly urged him to authenticate all the facts by affidavits, assuring him that if he was unsuccessful, I would endeavor to obtain the assistance of such persons as I might be 
acquainted with. On the seventeenth, Mr Paine called to tell 
me, that he had conversed on the same subject with Mr Burke, 
who had asked him if there was any minister, consul, or other 
agent of the United States, who could properly make application to the government, to which he had replied in the negative ; but said, that I was here, who had been a member of 
Congress, and was therefore the fittest person to step forward. 
In consequence of what passed thereupon between them, he 
urged me to take the matter up, which I promised to do. On 
the eighteenth I wrote to the Duke of Leeds, requesting an 
interview. He desired me to come at three o clock the next 
day ; but his note was delivered after the hour was passed, 
and very shortly after it, came another note, giving me an 
appointment for the twentieth. 
</p><p>
Upon entering his closet he apologized for not answering 
my letters. I told him that I had in my turn an apology to 
make for troubling him with an affair^ on which I was not authorized to speak. He said I had misunderstood one part of 
his letter to me, for that he certainly meant to express a 
willingness to enter into a treaty of commerce. I replied, that 
as to my letter I supposed he would answer it at his leisure, 
and therefore we would wave the discussion. That my 
present object was to mention the conduct of their pressgangs, who had taken many American seamen, and had entered American vessels with as little ceremony as those 
belonging to Britain. I believe, my Lord, this is the only 
instance in which we are not treated as aliens. He acknowledged that it was wrong, and would speak to Lord Chatham 
on the subject. I told him that many disagreeable circumstances had already happened, and that there was reason to expect many more, in a general impress through the British 
dominions. That masters of vessels, on their return to America, would excite much heat ; c and that, my Lord, combined 
with other circumstances, may perhaps occasion very disagreeable events. 
</p><p>
He then repeated his assurances of good will, and expressed an anxious wish to prevent all disagreement ; observing at 
the same time, that there was much difficulty in distinguishing seamen of the two countries. I acknowledged the 
inconveniences to which they might be subjected by the pretence of British seamen to be Americans, and wished there 
fore that some plan might be adopted, which, founded on good 
faith, might at the same time prevent the concealment of 
British sailors, and protect the Americans from insult. As a 
means of accomplishing that end, I suggested the idea of certificates of citizenship to be given by the admiralty courts 
in America to our seamen. He seemed much pleased, and 
willing at once to adopt it ; but I desired him to consult first 
the King's servants in that particular department ; and having 
again reminded him that I spoke without authority, took my 
leave ; but at his request, promised to visit him again the next day. 
</p><p>
The morning of the twenty-first I found him sitting with Mr Pitt, to whom he presented me. The first point we took up 
was that of the impress. Mr Pitt expressed his approbation 
of the plan I had proposed to the Duke, but observed that it 
was liable to abuse, notwithstanding every precaution which 
the admiralty offices in America could take. I acknowledged 
that it was, but observed, that even setting aside the great political interests of both countries, it was for the commercial interest of Britain rather to wink at such abuse ; for that if they 
should be involved in a war with the House, of Bourbon, our 
commerce with Britain must be in American bottoms ; be 
cause a war premium of insurance would give a decided 
preference to the manufacturers of other countries in our 
markets ; but that no wages would induce American seamen 
to come within the British dominions, if they were thereby liable to be impressed. Mr Pitt replied to this, that the 
degree of risk, and consequently the rate of insurance, must 
depend upon the kind of war. Not taking any direct notice 
of this expression, I observed, that notwithstanding the wretched state of the French Government, there still existed much 
force in that country, and that the power of commanding 
human labor must also exist somewhere ; so that if the government would not arm their fleets, there would still be many 
privateers, and that in effect, the slenderest naval efforts must 
involve merchant vessels in considerable danger. 
</p><p>
Returning then to the consideration of the principal point, 
we discussed the means of carrying the plan with effect, and 
for that purpose I recommended that his majesty's servants 
should order all their marine officers to admit as evidence 
of being American seamen, the certificate to that effect of the 
admiralty in America, containing in it a proper description of 
the person, &c. ; but without excluding, however, other evidence ; and observed, that, in consequence of the communication, if such orders were given, the executive authority in 
America, without the aid of the legislature, by directions to 
the several admiralties, might carry the plan into effect, so 
far as relates to those seamen who should apply for certificates. I am induced to believe that this measure, if adopted, 
will not only answer the desired end, but be productive of 
other good consequences in America, which I will not now 
trouble you with the detail of. 
</p><p>
This affair being so far adjusted, we proceeded to new matters, 
and they both assured me that I had misapprehended the Duke's 
letter in regard to a treaty of commerce. I answered cooly, that 
it was very easy to rectify the mistake, but it appeared idle to 
form a new treaty until the parties should be thoroughly satisfied 
with that already existing. Mr Pitt then took up the conversation and said, that the delay of compliance on our part had 
rendered that compliance less effectual, and that cases must 
certainly exist where great injury had been sustained by the 
delay. To this I replied that delay is always a kind of breach, 
since as long as it lasts it is the non-performance of stipulations. 
I proceeded then to a more exact investigation of the question. 
And first, as I knew them to be annoyed with many applications 
for redress by those who had, and those who pretended to have suffered, I attempted to show what I really believe to be the fact, 
viz. that the injury was much smaller than was imagined, be 
cause among the various classes of American debtors, those 
only should be considered who had the ability, and not the will, 
to pay at the peace, and were now deprived of the ability. 
These I supposed to be not numerous ; and as to others, I stated interest as the natural compensation for delay of payment, 
observing that it was impossible to go into an examination of all 
the incidental evils. 
</p><p>
In the second place, I desired him to consider, that we in 
turn complained, that the British government had not, as they 
ought, paid for the slaves who were taken away. That we 
felt for the situation they were in, of being obliged either to break 
faith with the slaves whom they had seduced by the offer of 
freedom, or to violate the stipulations they had made with us 
upon that subject. That we were willing, therefore, to wave 
our literal claims ; but had every right to insist on compensation ; and that it would not be difficult for the planters to show, 
that they had sustained an annual loss from the want of men to 
cultivate their lands, and thereby produce the means of paying 
their debts. Mr Pitt exclaimed at this, as if it were an exaggerated statement. I at once acknowledged my belief that 
in this, as in all similar cases, there might be some exaggeration 
on both sides ; but, sir, what T have said tends to show that these 
complaints and inquiries are excellent, if the parties mean to 
keep asunder ; if they wish to come together, all such matter 
should be kept out of sight, and each side perform now, as 
well as the actual situation of things will permit. Mr Pitt then 
made many professions of an earnest desire to cultivate the 
best understanding, Stc. &tc. On the whole, he thought it 
might be best to consider the subject generally, and to see if, 
on general ground, some compensation would not be mutually made. I immediately replied, ( If I understand you, Mr Pitt, 
you wish to make a new treaty, instead of complying with the 
old one. He admitted this to be in some sort his idea, I said, 
that even on that ground I did not see what better could be 
done, than to perform the old one. As to the compensation for 
negroes taken away, it is too trifling an object for you to dispute, so that nothing remains but the posts ; I suppose, there 
fore, that you wish to retain those posts. Why, perhaps we 
may. ( They are not worth the keeping, for it must cost you 
a great deal of money, and produce no benefit. The only reason you can have to desire them, is to secure the fur trade, and 
that will centre in this country, let who will carry it on in America. I gave him the reasons for this opinion, which I am sure 
is well founded, but I will not trouble you with them. His answer was well turned. If you consider these posts as a trivial 
object, there is the less reason for requiring them. Pardon 
me, sir, I only state the retaining of them as useless to you, but 
this matter is to be considered in a different point of light. 
Those who made the peace acted wisely in separating the possessions of the two countries by so wide a water. It is essential to preserve this boundary, if you wish to live in amity with 
us. Near neighbors are seldom good ones, for the quarrels among 
borderers frequently bring on wars. If is, therefore, essential 
for both parties that you should give them up ; but as to us it 
is of particular importance, because our national honor is interested. You hold them with the avowed intention of forcing us 
to comply with such conditions as you may impose. Why, 
sir, as to the consideration of national honor, we can retort the 
observation, and say our honor is concerned in your delay 01 
performance of the treaty. No, sir, your natural and proper 
course was to comply fully on your part, and if then we had re 
fused a compliance, you might rightfully have issued letters of 
marque and reprisal to such of your subjects as were injured 
by our refusal. But the conduct you have pursued naturally 
excites resentment in every American bosom. We do not think 
it worth while to go to war with you for these posts ; but wt know our rights, and will avail ourselves oj them, when time 
and circumstances may suit. I 
</p><p>
Mr Pitt asked me if I had powers to treat. I told him I 
had not, and that we could not appoint any person as minister, 
they had so much neglected the former appointment. He asked me whether we would appoint a minister if they did. I told 
him that I could almost promise that we should, but was not 
authorized to give any positive assurance. The question then 
was, how to communicate on this subject. I suggested, that 
since much time might be unnecessarily consumed by reason 
of the distance and uncertainty of communication, it would per 
haps be expedient for them to appoint a minister, and delay 
his departure until we should have made a similar appointment. Mr Pitt said they might communicate to you their intention to appoint, &c. I told him, that his communication 
might encounter some little difficulty, because you could not 
properly hear anything from the British Consuls, these being 
characters unacknowledged in America. His pride was a little touched at this. I should suppose, Mr Morris, that attention might as well be paid to what they say, as that the Duke of 
Leeds and I should hold the present conversation with you. 
By no means, sir, I never should have thought of asking a conference with his Grace, if I had not possessed a letter from the 
President of the United States, which you know, my Lord, I 
left with you, and which I dare say you have communicated to 
Mr Pitt. He had. Mr Pitt said they could in like manner 
write a letter to one of their consuls. Yes, sir, and the letter 
will be attended to, but not the consul, who is in no respect different from any other British subject ; and this is the circumstance 
which I wished you to regard. He said in reply to this, that 
etiquette ought not to be pushed so far as to injure business, 
and keep the countries asunder. I assured him that the rulers 
of America had too much understanding to care for etiquette ; 
but prayed him at the same time to recollect, that they (the 
British,) had hitherto kept us at a distance, instead of making 
advances. That you had gone quite as far as they had any 
</p><p>
reason to expect, in writing the letter just mentioned, but that 
from what had passed in consequence of it, and which, as he 
might naturally suppose, I had transmitted, we could not but 
consider them as wishing to avoid an intercourse. He took up 
this point, and expressed again his hope that I would remove 
such an idea, assuring me that they were disposed to cultivate 
a connexion, &c. &c. To this I replied, that any written communications which his Grace of Leeds might make should be 
duly transmitted ; but I did not like to write mere conversation, 
because it might be misconceived ; and disagreeable questions 
afterwards arise, whereas written things remain and speak for 
themselves. They agreed to the propriety of this sentiment. 
</p><p>
I observed further, that our disposition towards a good understanding was evidenced, not only by your letter, but also by 
the decision of a majority of the House of Representatives, 
against laying extraordinary restrictions on British vessels in 
our ports. Mr Pitt said, that instead of restrictions, we ought 
to give them particular privileges, in return for those which we 
enjoy here. I assured him that I knew of none, except that of 
being impressed, a privilege which of all others we least wished 
to partake of. The Duke of Leeds observed, in the same 
style of jocularity, that we were at least treated in that respect 
as the most favored nation, seeing that we were treated like 
themselves. But Mr Pitt said seriously, that they had certainly evidenced good will towards us, by what they had done 
respecting our commerce. I replied, therefore, with like seriousness, that their regulations had been dictated by a view to 
their own interest ; and therefore, as we felt no favor, we owned no obligation. The subject being now pretty well exhausted, they promised to consult together, and give me the result 
of their deliberations. This I am yet to receive ; but I learn 
that Mr Greenville has this day consulted some persons skilled 
in the fur trade, and that from his conversation it seemed 
probable that they would give up the posts. My information 
is good. 
</p><p>
I have already said that the Ministers here count upon the 
nullity of France. They do not however expect that she will 
violate her treaty with Spain, and therefore they are rather. 
I believe, in hopes that Spain will submit to such terms as 
they may impose. How far they may be bound to aid Prussia seems as yet to be doubtful ;. but for my own part I believe, 
that a war is inevitable, and I act on that ground. If it does 
not take place, they will, I think, desire such things of us, in a 
treaty of commerce, as we shall not be disposed to grant ; but 
if it does happen, then they will give us a good price for our 
neutrality ; and Spain, I think, will do so too ; wherefore this 
appears to be a favorable moment for treating with that court 
about the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
Before I close this letter, already too long, I must entreat 
permission to make one or two explanatory observations/. It 
is evident that the conduct of this government towards us, from 
the time of my first interview with the Duke of Leeds, has de 
pended on the contingencies of war or peace with the neigh 
boring powers ; and they have kept things in suspense accordingly. When, therefore, they came a little forward, it proved 
to me their apprehension of a rupture I have some reason 
to think, that they are in greater danger than they are them 
selves aware of, and I have much cause to suspect that they 
meditate a blow in Flanders, in which it is not improbable that 
they will be foiled and disappointed. Believing, therefore, 
that I knew their motives, it only remained to square my con 
duct and conversation accordingly. And here you will con 
sider, that the characteristic of this nation is pride ; whence it 
follows, that if they are brought to sacrifice a little of this self-importance, they will readily add some other sacrifices. I 
kept therefore a little aloof, and did not, as I might have done 
obtain an assurance that they would appoint a minister if you 
would. On the contrary, it now stands on such ground that 
they must write a letter, making the first advance, which you 
of course will be in possession of. And to that effect I warned them against sending a message by one of their consuls. I 
am, &c.
