SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favour of October 3ist came to hand a few days 
since, with the vote of the House of Representatives appointing me their agent here, which, as it was unsolicited on my 
part, I esteem the greater honour ; and shall be very happy, 
if I can, in that capacity, render my country any acceptable 
service. 
</p><p>
I have also just received your letter, of November 6th, 
containing an account of the state and circumstances of the 
province, and the grievances it labours under, with sundry 
depositions and other papers. Another of November iyth, with a pamphlet, entitled, the "Proceedings of Council," 
&c. ; another of November 23d, containing an order on Mr. De Berdt for papers. I can at present only say, that I shall 
immediately endeavour to make myself master of the business 
committed to my care, that so, when the Parliament and public 
boards, which are now adjourned for a month, shall meet 
again, I may be ready to proceed, in such manner, as, on conferring with Mr. Bollan, shall appear advisable for obtaining 
redress of the grievances so justly complained of. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you, from good authority, 
that the project formed by the enemies of the province, for 
bringing into Parliament a bill to abridge our charter rights, 
though at first it received some countenance, and great pains 
were taken to recommend it, is now laid aside. I do not 
presume to suppose, that the opposition I gave to it, (by showing the imprudence of the measure, and declaring openly my 
opinion on all occasions, that, the charter being a compact 
between the King and the people of the colony who were out 
o) the realm of Great Britain, there existed nowhere on earth a 
power to alter it, while its terms were complied with, without 
the consent o] BOTH the contracting parties^) had any weight 
on the occasion. I rather think, that a disposition prevails of 
late to be on good terms with the colonies, especially as we 
seem to be on the eve of a war with Spain ; and that, in consequence of that disposition, which I hope we shall cultivate, 
more attention has been paid to the sober advice of our 
friends, and less to the virulent instigations of our enemies. 
</p><p>
I beg you will present my dutiful respects to the House of 
Representatives, and assure them of my most faithful endeavours in their service. With great esteem and regard, I 
have the honour to be, &c. B. FRANKLIN.
