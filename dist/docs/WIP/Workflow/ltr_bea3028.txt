GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I wrote you from <a href='/results.php?city=lachine' rel='city'>La Chine</a>, yesterday morning, that the army 
marched at six o clock for this place. We arrived here with the 
main body at six o clock in the afternoon, when we discovered 
several of the enemy s, bateaux taking our unhappy prisoners off 
an island at one league distance from us. Words cannot express 
our anxiety, as it was not in our power to relieve them. Our 
bateaux were a league behind, coming up the rapids very slowly. 
I sent several expresses to hurry them. However, it was sunset 
before they arrived and I could embark all my people ; previous 
to which arrived some Caghnawaga Indians whom. I had sent 
early in the morning to the savages, demanding a surrender of 
our prisoners, and, in case of refusal, and that any of them were 
murdered, I would sacrifice every Indian who fell into my hands, 
and would follow them to their towns and destroy them by fire 
and sword. The answer I received was, that they had five hundred of our prisoners collected together, and that if we offered to 
land and attack them at Quinze Chiens, where they were posted, they would immediately kill every prisoner, and give no quarter to any who should fall into their hands hereafter. 
</p><p>
Words cannot express my feelings at the delivery of this message. Torn by the conflicting passions of revenge and humanity, 
a sufficient force to take ample revenge, raging for action, urged 
me on one hand ; and humanity for five hundred unhappy wretches, 
who were on the point of being sacrificed if our vengeance was not 
delayed, plead equally strong on the other. In this situation, I 
ordered the boats to row immediately for the island, where our 
prisoners had been confined. We there found five unhappy 
wretches, naked, and almost starved; the rest, they informed me, 
were all taken off by the savages just before, except one or two, 
who, being unwell, were inhumanly butchered. I immediately 
ordered the boats to row for Quinze Chiens, about four miles 
from the island on the main land. There the enemy had two 
brass six-pounders, were intrenched round the church, and well 
fortified. They began firing upon us, when we approached within 
three quarters of a mile of the shore, with their cannon and 
small arms. We rowed near in shore without returning a shot. 
By this time it was so dark we could not distinguish a man on 
shore, and, as Ave were unacquainted with the ground, and our 
people much fatigued, I judged it most prudent to return to St. 
Ann s. 
</p><p>
On our arrival, I called a Council of War, who were unanimous 
for attacking the enemy early in the morning ; and, at two 
o clock in the morning, Lieutenant Parke was sent to me with a 
flag and articles for exchange of prisoners, entered into by Major Sherburne and Captain Forster. One article was, that there 
should be an exchange of prisoners of equal rank, and that our 
troops should be under an obligation not to take up arms again; 
but the King's troops were to be at full liberty. This article I 
rejected, and despatched Lieutenant Parke to acquaint Captain Forster that I would enter into articles for exchange of prisoners 
on equal terms, which, if he refused, my determination was to 
attack him immediately ; and, if our prisoners were murdered, to 
sacrifice every soul who .fell into our hands. Captain Forster 
agreed to these terms, and sent them back signed. As they 
were not so explicit as I judged necessary, with some alterations 
and explanations I returned them. Inclosed you receive a copy, 
as finally agreed to. This matter was finished at six o clock this evening, and to-morrow morning part of the prisoners are to be sent to Caghnawaga. 
</p><p>
You may be surprised that six days were allowed for the deli 
very of the prisoners, and that hostilities should in the mean 
time cease. This does not include the savages. Captain Forster 
pretended it was not in his power to fix on any particular time 
for that purpose, but would engage, on his honor, to deliver them 
as soon as possible ; and proposed, if it could be done in less 
time, hostilities should then commence, of which Captain Forster 
is to determine and acquaint me this evening. The base, hypo 
critical conduct of the King's officers, their employing savages to 
screen them in their butcheries, their suffering their prisoners to 
be killed in cool blood, I will leave with you to comment on. I 
observed to Captain Forster, that it appeared very extraordinary 
to me, that he could influence the savages to deliver up the prisoners, and could not keep them from being murdered in cool 
blood, or prevent their being stripped naked, contrary to the 
agreement made with the garrison at the Cedars. 
</p><p>
I intend being with you this evening, to consult on some effectual measures to take with these savages, and still more savage 
British troops, who are still at Quinze Chiens. As soon as our 
prisoners are released, I hope it will be in our power to take 
ample vengeance, or we nobly fall in the attempt. I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. A party of fourteen or fifteen Canadians, taken at the 
Cedars, are excluded from the above treaty; Captain Forster 
alleging that he had positive orders from government for that 
purpose. 
</p><p>
ARTICLES FOR EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. 
</p><p>
After the maturest deliberation on the customs and manners 
of the savages in war, which I find so opposite and contrary 
to the humane disposition of the British Government, and to 
all civilized nations, and to avoid the inevitable consequences of 
the savage customs in former wars (which by their threats and menaces I find is not changed), that of their putting their prisoners to death, to disencumber themselves in case of their being attacked by their enemy ; I have, therefore, in compliance with 
the above disposition in Government, and the dictates of humanity, thought fit to enter into the following articles of agreement 
with General Arnold, in the name of the power he is employed 
by, and of the officers and soldiers, who shall be released by 
this agreement, whose rank and numbers shall be indorsed on 
this cartel. 
</p><p>
1st. That there shall be an exchange of prisoners faithfully 
made, returning an equal number of his Majesty's troops of the 
same rank with those released by this agreement, as soon as 
possible, within the space of two months, allowing a moderate 
time for casualties that may render the performance of this article impracticable. 
</p><p>
2d. That the prisoners shall be conducted in safety, with all 
possible convenience and despatch that circumstances will permit 
to the south shore of the River St. Lawrence, from which they 
are to repair to St. John s, and return to their own countries 
immediately, without committing any waste or spoil on their 
march thither, allowing ten or twelve to go to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> to 
transact their private affairs. 
</p><p>
3d. That the prisoners so returned shall not, under any pretext whatsoever, either in words, writing, or signs, give the least 
information to Government enemies, or their adherents now in 
arms, in the least prejudicial to his Majesty's service. 
</p><p>
4th. That hostages be delivered for the performance of these 
articles to the full, according to the sense and spirit of the agreement, without any equivocation whatsoever. 
</p><p>
5th. That the security of the subscribers be given to the in 
habitants for all the waste and spoil committed by the detachments under Colonel Bedel, on fair accounts, attested and signed, 
being delivered, and for which the hostages are not to be answerable. 
</p><p>
It being our full intention to fulfil the above articles, we 
mutually sign and interchange them as assurances of performance. 
</p><p>
Given under our hands this 27th day of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
VAUDREUIL. 
</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King's troops. 
</p><p>
Article 2d. The prisoners shall be sent to the south shore 
of St. Lawrence within one league of Caghnawaga, and from 
thence to St. John's and their own country, except twelve, who 
have liberty to go to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, for which purpose six days shall 
be allowed, and hostilities to cease on both sides. 
</p><p>
Article 4. Four Captains shall be sent to Quebec as hostages, and remain there until prisoners are exchanged. 
</p><p>
Article 5th. The Continental troops, from principle, have ever 
avoided plundering. Upon proof being made of any waste committed by Colonel Bedel's detachment, reparation shall be made. 
Given under our hands this 27th of May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>, at St. Ann s. 
</p><p>
BENEDICT ARNOLD, 
Brigadier-General of the Continental troops. 
</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King's troops. 
</p><p>
Two Majors, nine Captains, twenty subalterns, four hundred and forty-three soldiers. But if the prisoners can be conducted 
in less time, this truce to cease on the return of the last boats employed on this service, on notice given. 
</p><p>
GEORGE FORSTER, 
Captain Commanding the King's troops. 
</p><p>
May 27th, 1770. Answer. If Captain Forster will choose to 
have hostilities commence in less time than six days, it will be 
perfectly agreeable to me, provided the time is fixed on, and 
notice given this evening. 
</p><p>
BENEDICT ARNOLD, 
</p><p>
Brigadier- General.
