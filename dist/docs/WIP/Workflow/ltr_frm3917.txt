SIR: 
</p><p>
My last acquainted you that your letter was laid before the Governor and Council, Since that, I have received their instructions, and have sent <a href="/results.php?tla=frm" rel="colleague met">Col. Peter Horry</a>, CoL Baxter and Major James, to confer with you, and offer such terms as I can, and wish it may be acceded to, and 
prevent the effusion of blood and distresses of the women and children. The Colonels will give you a paper, in which you will find the determination of the British making peace with the Americans, which leaves you no hope of being supported by them. I have marched thus far 
with my brigade, for the purpose^of either making terms, or prosecuting the war, whenever the term of the truce expires. And you may 
depend that I shall not infringe it until then; but wish that you may know your own interest, by submitting in time, and preventing ill consequences from obstinacy, which must terminate in your own and your 
people's destruction, and cannot be prevented when the North Carolinians come on, who are on the march, and are near at hand. Col Horry, and the gentlemen above mentioned, will talk with you, and 
acquaint you with every particular with which they are charged. In the meantime, you will consider them under the sanction of a flag of truce ; and you, or such men as will meet them at Birche's, shall be protected under that sanction. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your humblfe servant,
