Dear John, 
</p><p>
I am two letters in your debt, and am conscious that I 
shall make an ill return for them in offering you this product of a midnight hour, after a day spent in the fatigue of 
business and ceremony that our present situation exacts. 
But having just been informed by Mr. Piatt that he sails 
to-morrow morning, I cannot permit him to go, without 
offering you my congratulations on an event which you 
have so greatly contributed to bring about, the evacuation 
of tins city by the British on Tuesday last. 
</p><p>
Our enemies are hardly more astonished than we are 
ourselves, and than you will be when you hear that we 
have been five days in town without the smallest disturbance ; that the most obnoxious royalists that had sufficient 
confidence in our clemency to stay had not met with the 
least insult. Their shops were opened the day after we 
came in, and Rivington himself goes on as usual. The 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Gazette is as well received as if he had 
never been printer to the king's most excellent majesty. 
So that your friends in Europe will find their apprehensions 
ill-founded, and that the race of tories will not, after all, be 
totally extinct in America. Perhaps, by good training and 
by crossing the breed frequently (as they are very tame), 
they may be rendered useful animals in a few generations. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your prints of the air-balls ; but wish to 
have some fuller account of their composition, and the use 
proposed to be made of them. As an architect, I cannot 
but be curious about the first castles in the air that promise 
to have some stable use. 
</p><p>
Receive my congratulations on the birth of your daughter, and make my compliments to Mrs. Jay on the occasion. 
</p><p>
I had hardly finished the last line, when I was alarmed 
by a very loud rumbling noise, accompanied by a quick 
tremulous motion of the earth. The family are too much 
alarmed to permit me to add more. Adieu.
