SIR: 
</p><p>
I presume the draught has been made of a fourth part of your regiment, for patrol duty, according to the directions I gave some time ago, 
and expected that the remainder would have been in town before now. I 
think it necessary, that a field officer should be here with them you 
will be pleased to repair hither, with such of the regiment as are not 
to do patrol duty, as soon as possible. The persons belonging to your 
regiment, who have taken protection, are to be tried here by a court 
from that regiment. It is therefore necessary, in order that their case 
may be decided, that a part of the regiment should be here you will 
suffer such other as Mr. Harden names to go with him on a particular 
piece of business, which I have committed to his charge; you will order 
all the evidences against the plunderers you've sent down, to repair 
hither immediately, that they may be brought to trial for their offences 
before a Court Martial. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your very humble servant, 
</p><p>
