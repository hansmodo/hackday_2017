Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Shortly after the intelligence of hostilities by the Algerines, 
I applied to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as being interested in putting a stop thereto, in order to cover the arrival 
of provisions in our ships. It was agreed that the Republic 
should, in conformity to our, treaty, endeavor to obtain a 
treaty for us with the Algerines. But as it was uncertain 
whether the Dey would negotiate such treaty with the agents 
of France, I was desired to name one for the United States. 
</p><p>
I therefore stated my want of power ; but it being impossible to get a seasonable answer from America to letters on the 
subject, I agreed to make the appointment of a person, who 
should come forward in case of necessity. I accordingly 
have sent M. James Leray, a naturalized citizen of America, 
to accompany the French Commissioners. He will appear 
as a Frenchman, unless circumstances call for the production 
of his powers. My instructions to him, after stating my want 
of authority, are, in substance, to aid in obtaining the best 
possible treaty for the smallest possible sum, and to confine 
the duration thereof to one year, unless approved of by the 
President, and to procure the liberation of our captivated fellow citizens. 
</p><p>
The French Commissioners are not yet gone, though it is 
now two months since everything was agreed on. Such are 
the delays, which result from the disorganized state of affairs 
in this country. I am, &tc.
