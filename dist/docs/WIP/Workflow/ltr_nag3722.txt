Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='met'>Governor Rutledge</a> arrived in camp a few days 
since, and informed me that a French fleet of twenty 
sail of the line, besides frigates, were to be on the 
coast by the 25th of this month, to cooperate with 
the American army for dispossessing the enemy of 
the several posts they hold in the United States; 
and that there are to come with the fleet from five 
to ten thousand troops, to facilitate operations. So 
great a naval and land force, aided by our own exertions, cannot fail, if properly directed, of totally 
ruining the enemy in this country. As late and full 
information will be necessary to enable your Excellency to judge what objects to give the preference 
to, as well as what force may be necessary for each, 
I have taken the earliest opportunity to communicate the fullest intelligence I possess from tins quarter. 
And, as you may wish to make more inquiries, I 
have sent the despatches by one of my Aids, Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, that you may not only be satisfied in all matters respecting our situation, but that 
you may have a better opportunity of conveying such 
instructions in return as may be unsafe to write. 
</p><p>
Major Burnett, one of my Aids, who is much indisposed, set out from this camp eight or ten days 
since for the northward. By him I wrote fully our 
situation, and I desired him to give your Excellency 
such information as I had omitted to mention in my 
letter. But, as this is a new matter, I thought it 
most advisable to send Colonel Morris, notwithstanding, I have received no letters from the Marquis for 
near a month, and none from your Excellency since 
the 1st of June, in which you informed me of the 
preparations making for an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
By this time I suppose the operations are in great 
forwardness ; and, if the force from the islands arrive 
agreeably to the Ministers' expectations, the reduction 
of the place must be speedy and certain. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
as a place of arms, and from the importance of its 
situation to harass and distress our people, may be 
considered as the greatest object on the Continent; 
and, in my opinion, every effort should be made for 
its reduction in preference to all others. If that 
place w\as reduced, and the enemy could not repossess it, I think it would lay the foundation for their 
evacuating all the possessions in the United States 
south of it. There would be no harbour for their 
shipping, except in Virginia, and no convenient place 
there for an army to winter in, which would necessarily oblige them to quit their possessions in that 
quarter. 
</p><p>
The forces that the enemy have in Virginia under 
Lord Cornwallis, and at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, from the best 
information I can get, amount to little more than five 
thousand men. The Marquis's regular force is not 
more than two to three ; but there is a large body 
of militia in the field, and it may be increased to almost any number, if arms could be had. Twenty-five 
hundred regular forces, to be added to the Marquis's 
arm}, besides what may be expected from Pennsylvania and Virginia, would oblige Cornwallis to take 
a position and fortify himself; and if the supplies to 
his army could be cut off by water, which the fleet 
may easily effect, after the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
lie would be obliged to surrender in a fortnight or 
three weeks at most, for want of provisions; for I 
believe he has none laid in at any point, nor in 
expectation of being obliged to act on the defensive. 
At least, I am persuaded he has no apprehension of 
having his water communication interrupted. After 
the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I should suppose the 
whole French fleet might enter the Chesapeake, and, 
all hopes of escaping by water being removed, it 
would greatly contribute to the speedy surrender of 
the enemy, from the terror and apprehensions it would 
raise among the troops. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> is the greatest object to the southward, 
as well from the strength of its garrison and dependencies, as from the advantages the enemy derive from 
the trade of the place, and the distress it brings 
upon the people for want of commerce, particularly 
in the article of salt. The place is strong, and difficult to approach. Large shipping can be of no use 
in the reduction of it. Frigates are the largest size 
that can enter the harbour. The enemy have fortified 
none of the islands, nor have they added many works about the town. However, they have erected two large new works in front of the old lines, that mount 
from twenty to thirty pieces of cannon each. These 
works have great command of the town, as well as 
the rivers. One other new work is nearly completed 
on the marsh, called Shute's Folly, on the harbour 
side of the town, and intended to defend the place 
against shipping. The enemy have, from the best information I can get, in this State about four thousand infantry and four hundred horse, of regular 
troops. Besides these, they have near one thousand 
militia and Tories, who adhere to their interest. In 
addition to this, one thousand sailors, and four or five 
hundred negroes, may be calculated upon. Their collective strength will amount, in all probability, to between six and seven thousand men of different characters ; and the militia Tories, from their being such 
exceeding good marksmen, will not be the least useful. 
</p><p>
Our force in Continental troops will amount to little more than fifteen hundred men; from four to five 
hundred State troops, belonging to South Carolina; 
and, I imagine, from fifteen hundred to two thousand 
militia may be raised in North and South Carolina, 
to join in the reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. A greater 
force than this cannot be calculated upon, nor am I 
altogether certain so large a body of militia can be 
kept up during the siege ; but it is possible a much 
greater can be got out upon so important an occasion, 
and when things wear so flattering a face. To reduce 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> with certainty and despatch, not less than 
ten thousand troops should be added to the force that 
may be expected here; but if this force cannot be 
had, I should think it should be attempted with less. 
The garrison will doubtless have provisions in plenty ; 
and I believe, if we can command the water, our army 
may be easily supplied, provided the operations are 
brought to an issue before the 1st of January, or by 
that time. I have inclosed some notes respecting the 
places the most proper for landing ; but <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a> and General Duportail can give you more particular information respecting this matter. If the 
operations cannot be carried on in Virginia and here 
at the same time, I think <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> must have the 
preference, as the greatest object. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> being taken, the enemy 
will most assuredly leave Virginia, should time fail 
us to effect the reduction of the whole, which I hope 
will not be the case. All the stores of every kind 
necessary for the siege must come with the fleet, as 
we have nothing here to prosecute one with. The 
reduction of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will naturally produce the 
surrender of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> and Wilmington, especially as 
there is but little force at either ; not more than four 
hundred at one, and three hundred at the other. I 
think <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> may be reduced in thirty days, after 
the troops effect a landing; and there can be no difficulty in this, as the enemy have no force at any of 
those places, nor will they venture to detach from 
town for the purpose. And it is not impossible, if the 
enemy should attempt to hold the upper country, a 
landing may be effected so speedily as to prevent 
their getting into town. This would greatly facilitate 
the reduction of the place, as well from the effect it 
would have upon the spirits of the garrison, as from 
the diminution of their force. 
</p><p>
I suppose the British fleet on this coast, on the 
arrival of the French fleet, will immediately take 
shelter in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and assist in the defence of the 
place, or run off to the West Indies. The first would be the most desirable, and is what I hope our good 
ally will oblige them to do. This would secure a 
superiority by sea during the whole campaign, which 
may be doubtful, should Admiral Rodney follow the 
French fleet from the West Indies, and effect a junction with the force on this coast. But, if the French 
effect a junction of theirs first, and block up the British in New York, so as to prevent a junction of 
their shipping, the enemy will not have it in their 
power either to raise the siege of the place or take 
off the garrison. But should the British fleet on this 
coast even run for the West Indies, there is the 
greatest probability of the two fleets missing each 
other on their passage, and still leave our allies masters of the sea, at least until <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> can be reduced. But what I most wish is, that the force our 
ally means to employ upon this coast may be superior to the enemy's collective strength, both from the 
West Indies and on this coast. This will insure us 
success at all events. 
</p><p>
As your Excellency is doubtless more fully informed respecting the force of both fleets, and of the 
intentions of our ally, than I am, and also of the 
probable aid which we may expect either from Europe 
or elsewhere, and as that will altogether govern our 
operations, I shall wait your directions respecting our 
preparations in this quarter. The enemy have no 
fortified posts in this State except <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, or in 
Georgia except <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. But their army is upon 
the Congaree, near McCord's Ferry. The distresses 
of the country are so great, and their calamities increase so fast for want of salt and many other articles, as well as from the ravages of the enemy, that 
I wish it may be in our powder, by the generous exertions of our good ally, to effect something for their 
relief, more than the little temporary respites arising 
from partial advantages, which are all we can hope 
or expect from our little force in this country. If 
Lord Cornwallis should find that his situation in Virginia may expose him to the loss of his army, it is 
highly probable he will attempt to get back to 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> by land or water. The first I shall endeavour to guard against, and the last I hope our 
ally will be able to prevent, by sending a few frigates into the Bay, or stationing them off the Capes. 
The cavalry of Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's 
corps have taken, killed, and wounded, near forty of 
the enemy's cavalry since my last. The most considerable attack was made by Captain Watts. He charged 
a party of twenty odd of the enemy, with an inferior 
force, took six, killed three, and wounded eight or 
nine more. The enterprise of our cavalry equals any 
thing the world ever produced. With the most perfect respect and esteem, I am, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant,
