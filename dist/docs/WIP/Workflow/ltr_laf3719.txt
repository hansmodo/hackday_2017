My dear General, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 2d instant is just come to hand. 
Mine of yesterday mentioned that the ships in York 
River had gone down. Inclosed is an account I receive of an engagement off the Capes. What disposition has been made for the internal protection 
of the Bay, I do not know. James River is still 
guarded, but we have not as yet received any letter 
from Count de Grasse, relative to his last movements. 
I hasten to communicate them, as your Excellency 
will probably think it safer to keep the troops at 
the Head of Elk until Count de Grasse returns. Indeed, unless the greatest part of your force is brought 
here, a small addition can do but little more than we 
effect. Lord Cornwallis will, in a little time, render 
himself very respectable. I ardently wish your whole 
army may soon be brought down to operate. 
</p><p>
AVe will make it our business to reconnoitre the 
enemy's works, and give you, on your arrival, the 
best description of them in our power. I expect the 
Governor this evening, and will again urge the necessity of providing what you have recommended. By 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I hear that two British 
frigates followed the French fleet, and returned after 
they had seen them out of the Capes, A spy says 
that two schooners, supposed to be French, have been 
seen landing, up York River. But we have nothing 
so certain as to insure your voyage, though it is probable that Count de Grasse will soon return, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to request, my dear General, that in 
your answer to the Marquis de St. Simon, you will 
express your admiration at the celerity of their landing, and your sense of their cheerfulness in submitting to the difficulties of the first movements. Indeed, I should be happy something might also be 
said to Congress on the subject. Your approbation 
of my conduct emboldens me to request that, as <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> will of course take command of the 
American part of your army, the division I shall have 
under him may be composed of the troops which 
have gone through the fatigues and dangers of the 
Virginian campaign. This will be the greatest reward of the services I may have rendered, as I confess I have the strongest attachment to those troops. 
With the highest respect, I have the honor to be. 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
