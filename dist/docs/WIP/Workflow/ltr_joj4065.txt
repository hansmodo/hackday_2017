Dear Morris, 
</p><p>
The sight of your friendly letter of the 25th of July last, 
and of those it recommends, gave me much pleasure. 
Marks of remembrance from old acquaintances, and the 
society of fellow-citizens in a foreign country, excite agreeable sensations. I have, as yet, met with neither men nor 
things on this side of the water which abate my predilection, or, if you please, my prejudices in favour of those on 
the other. I have but few attachments in Europe much 
stronger than those we sometimes feel for an accidental 
fellow-traveller, or for a good inn and a civil landlord. 
We leave our approbation, and good wishes, and a certain 
degree of regard with them, by way of paying that part of 
the reckoning and travelling expenses which money cannot 
always defray. My affections are deeply rooted in America, 
and are of too long standing to admit of transplantation. 
In short, my friend, I can never become so far a citizen of 
the world as to view every part of it with equal regard ; 
and perhaps nature is wiser in tying our hearts to our native 
soil, than they are who think they divest themselves of foibles in proportion as they wear away those bonds. It is 
not difficult to regard men of every nation as members of 
the same family ; but when placed in that point of view, 
my fellow-citizens appear to me as my brethren, and the 
others as related to me only in the more distant and adventitious degrees.

I am glad my letter by Mr. Grigby gave you reason to 
infer an alteration for the better in the state of my health, 
because I flatter myself it afforded pleasure to my friends. 
The tact is, that my disorder has been gradually declining 
ever since I left the city ; but although the pain in my 
breast has diminished, it still continues, and daily tells me 
memento mori. As to the fever which the influenza left 
me, it has at last, thank God, taken its leave. During all 
my sickness, I have been happy in preserving a constant 
flow of spirits ; and cheerfulness, that agreeable companion, 
has never forsaken me. I hope a trip to Bath will so 
patch up my " house of clay" as to render it tenantable 
a good while longer ; a thorough repair I do not promise 
myself. 
</p><p>
Your account of my son pleases me. I expect and wish 
to see him next summer ; for it is time to lay the foundation of those habits and principles by which I am desirous 
that his conduct through life should be influenced. Nature 
has not given to children any instinctive affections for their 
parents ; and youth, that fair season of virtue and ingenuousness, presents the only opportunity for our perfectly 
gaining their hearts. This conspires with a great variety of 
other considerations to call me home ; and I should not be 
satisfied with myself if I prolonged my excursion from private life beyond the term which, for public reasons, I at first 
prescribed it. When a man's conduct ceases to be uniform 
and consistent, it ceases to be proper. My little girls are 
well, and their mother is not much otherwise. So much 
for domestic matters ; now for a few lines on politics. 
</p><p>
While there are knaves and fools in the world, there will 
be wars in it ; and that nations should make war against 
nations is less surprising than their living in uninterrupted 
peace and harmony. 
</p><p>
You have heard that the Ottoman and Russian empires are 
on the point of unsheathing the sword. The objects of the 
contest are more easy to discern than the issue ; but if Russia 
should extend her navigation to Constantinople, we may be 
the better for it That circumstance is an additional motive to our forming a treaty of commerce with her. Your 
commercial and geographical knowledge render it unnecessary for me to enlarge on this subject. But whatever we 
may have to do abroad, it is of little consequence when 
compared to what we have to do at home. 
</p><p>
I am perfectly convinced that no time is to be lost in 
raising and maintaining a national spirit in America. Power 
to govern the confederacy, as to all general purposes, should 
be granted and exercised. The governments of the different 
States should be wound up, and become vigorous. America 
is beheld with jealousy, and jealousy is seldom idle. Settle 
your boundaries without delay. It is better that some 
improper limits should be fixed, than any left in dispute. 
In a word, every thing conducive to union and constitutional energy of government should be cultivated, cherished, 
and protected, and all counsels and measures of a contrary 
complexion should at least be suspected of impolitic views 
and objects.

The rapid progress of luxury at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is a frequent 
topic of conversation here ; and what is a little remarkable, 
I have not heard a single person speak of it in terms of 
.approbation.

Believe me to be

Your friend and servant,
