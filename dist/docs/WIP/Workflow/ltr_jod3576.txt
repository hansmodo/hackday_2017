MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
I AM weary of this scene of dulness. We have done 
nothing and shall do nothing this session, which ought 
to be done, unless we should appropriate a sufficient 
sum of money for treating with the Algerines. We 
are afraid to go to war, though our inclinations and 
dispositions are strong enough to join the French re 
publicans. It is happy that our fears are a check to 
our resentments ; and our understandings are better 
than our hearts. 
</p><p>
One day spent at home would afford me more in 
ward delight and comfort than a week or a winter in 
this place. We have frequent rumors and alarms 
about the yellow fever, but when they come to be 
traced to their sources, they have hitherto proved to 
be false. There is one at present in circulation which 
is not quite cleared up, and the weather is extremely 
warm, muggy, foggy, and unfavorable for the season. 
The river is open and, some say, is never frozen over 
after this time. Others say there have been instances 
in the last week in January.

Thomas visits me of evenings, and we converse 
concerning Hambden and Falkland, Charles and Oli 
ver, Essex and Rupert, of whose characters and con 
duct he reads every day in Lord Clarendon. I fear 
he makes too many visits in families where there are 
young ladies. Time is spent and nothing learned. 
Pardon me ! Disciple of Wolstoncraft ! I never relished conversations with ladies, excepting with one at 
a time, and alone rather than in company. I liked 
not to lose my time. I begin now to think all time 
lost that is not employed in farming ; innocent, heal 
thy, gay, elegant amusement ! Enchanting employ-ment ! how my imagination roves over my rocky 
mountains, and through my brushy meadows. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.
