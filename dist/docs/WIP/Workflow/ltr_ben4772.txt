SIR : Discoursing with Captain Folger, a very intelligent 
Mariner of the Island of Nantucket, in New England, concerning the long Passages made by some ships bound from 
England to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I received from him the following Information, viz., 
</p><p>
That the Island in which he lives is inhabited chiefly by 
People concerned in the Whale Fishery, in which they employed near 150 Sail of Vessels; that the Whales are found 
generally near the Edges of the Gulph Stream, a strong Current so called, which comes out of the Gulph of Florida, 
passing Northeasterly along the Coast of America, and then 
turning off most Easterly, running at the rate of 4, 3^, 3, and 
2 J Miles an Hour. That the Whaling Business leading these 
People to cruise along the Edges of the Stream in quest of 
Whales, they are become better acquainted with the Course, 
Breadth, Strength, and Extent of the same, than those Navigators can well be who only cross it in their Voyages to and 
from America, that they have Opportunities of discovering the 
strength of it when their Boats are out in the pursuit of this 
Fish, and happen to get into the Stream while the Ship is out 
of it, or out of the Stream while the Ship is in it, for then they 
are separated very fast, and would soon loose sight of each 
other if care were not taken that in crossing the Stream to 
and fro, they frequently in the same meet and speak with 
Ships bound from England to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Virginia, &c. who 
have Passages of 8, 9, and 10 weeks and are still far from 
Land, and not likely to be in with it for some time, being engaged in that part of the Stream that sets directly against 
them, and it is supposed that their Fear of Cape Sable 
Shoals, George's Banks, or Nantucket Shoals, hath induced 
them to keep so far to the southward as unavoidably to engage them in the said Gulph Stream, which occasions the 
length of their Voyage, since in a Calm it carries them directly 
back, and tho' they may have fair Winds, yet the Current 
being 60 or 70 Miles a Day, is so much subtracted from the 
way they make thro' the Water. At my request Captain 
Folger hath been so obliging as to mark for me on a Chart 
the Dimensions, Course and Swiftness of the Stream from 
its first coming out of the Gulph when it is narrowest and 
strongest, until it turns away to go to the southward of the 
Western Islands, where it is Broader and Weaker, and to 
give me withall some written Directions whereby Ships 
bound from the Banks of Newfoundland to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> may 
avoid the said Stream ; and yet be free of Danger from the 
Banks and Shoals above mentioned. As I apprehend that 
such Chart and Directions may be of use to our Packets in 
shortning their Voyages, I send them to you, that if their 
Lordships should think fit, so much of the Chart as is contained within the Red Lines may be engraved, and printed, 
together with the Remarks, at the Charge of the Office; or 
at least the Manuscript Copies may be made of the same for 
the use of the Packets. The Expence of the former would not 
much exceed the latter and would besides be of general Service.
