Sir, 
</p><p>
In answer to your Excellency's questions, proposed 
to the Council of General Officers on the 6th instant, 
I beg leave to observe that, from the uncertainty of the arrival of the second division of the French fleet, 
as well as of their force, and from the fluctuating 
situation of our affairs, which may be totally changed 
in a short time, by a variety of circumstances which 
may happen, it appears to me extremely difficult to 
determine, with any degree of precision, the line of 
conduct proper to be observed. 
</p><p>
If the second division of the French fleet may be 
soon expected, and their force, of which I am ignorant, will give us a decided superiority over the enemy as well by land as sea, I am of opinion every 
necessary preparation and disposition should be made 
to attack <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, provided we have a sufficiency 
of ammunition and military stores, and there is a 
prospect of the army (when collected) being supplied 
with provision (the former I much doubt). But if 
there is not good reason to suppose the second division of the French fleet, with a force superior to that 
of the enemy, will arrive in the course of a month, 
I am of opinion no offensive operations can, with 
prudence, be undertaken this fall against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> j 
in which case, it is possible the enemy will detail a 
part of their force in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to join those in 
South Carolina, or to cooperate with those in Virginia or Maryland. 
</p><p>
I am, therefore, of opinion, that the Pennsylvania 
line, which I suppose to amount to twenty-five hundred or three thousand men, should hold themselves 
in readiness to march; and if the same division of 
the French fleet does not arrive by the 1st of October, that then the Pennsylvania line should march to 
the relief of the Southern States, who, with the aid 
of so formidable a regular force here, if they do their 
duty, will be able to repel the enemy in that quarter; and, if the French fleet should arrive too late to 
operate against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, South Carolina may be an 
object worthy their attention. 
</p><p>
Without a decided superiority by sea, I am of opinion no offensive operations against the enemy can, 
with prudence, be undertaken this fall; and, it is to 
be hoped, that the States, by this time, are convinced of the necessity of immediately raising an army 
during the war, and that they will, without loss of 
time, take future measures for that purpose. I should 
suppose the Pennsylvania line might be replaced by 
some of the troops at Rhode Island, before the time 
is expired for which the militia are called out. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
