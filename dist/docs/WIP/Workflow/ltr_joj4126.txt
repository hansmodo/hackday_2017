Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
A letter which I wrote tcyou on the 29th October last, 
contained the following paragraph, viz. : 
</p><p>
" I am authorized by <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a> to assure you, in the 
most explicit terms, that no instructions to stimulate or 
promote hostilities by the Indians against the United States, 
have been sent to the king's officers in Canada. I am preparing an official representation to him on this subject, and 
he will give me an official answer to it ; but as this cannot 
be done in season to forward by this vessel (for letters after 
this day will be too late to go by her), his lordship has 
permitted me to make this informal communication to you 
for your satisfaction. I am to lay before him a statement 
of the evidences relative to the interferences complained 
of, to the end that it may be sent to Canada, and strict 
inquiry made into the truth of the allegations and facts in 
question." 
</p><p>
My time and thoughts have ever since continued to be 
so entirely engrossed by the treaty which is now concluded, 
and was this day signed, as that it really has not been in 
my power to finish and present this representation. 
As to the treaty, it must speak for itself. A hasty letter 
which I have written to Mr. Randolph, contains some 
remarks on a few of the articles in it. That letter is far 
from being so particular as L could wish, but I cannot help 
it. My whole time has been employed. To do more was 
not possible. I wish that I could accompany the treaty, but 
I feel that I ought not to expose myself to the severities of 
a winter's voyage. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly anxious to return ; for although I have 
every other reason to be satisfied with my situation, yet I 
am not at home. I ought not to conceal from you, that the 
confidence reposed in your personal character was visible 
and useful throughout the negotiation. 
</p><p>
If there is noc a good disposition in the far greater part 
of the cabinet and nation towards us, I am exceedingly 
deceived. I do not mean an ostensible and temporizing, 
but a real good disposition. I wish it may have a fair trial. 
With perfect respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
