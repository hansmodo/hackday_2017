Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
10th inst. which I assure you requires no apology, as I am al 
ways not merely willing, but anxious to learn the opinion of 
judicious friends of the Bank. 
</p><p>
Since the Bank has ceased to be the depository of the public revenue, the indulgence formerly given to the State } 
Banks could scarcely be expected as it would be unreasonable and unjust to the Stockholders of the Bank of the 
U.S. to let the State Banks have the use of a large part of its capital without interest, while they were making interest
on it. The Board have therefore made a recent order for the J 
periodical settlement of those balances from the State Banks. The general object was to keep down this accumulation of 
debt from those institutions at the same time, nothing was 
more remote from the desire of the Bank than to oppress the 
State Institutions. On the contrary we should be disposed to give every reasonable facility in the settlement of the balances. 
It was probably some misapprehension of the design of the Bank which occasioned the excitement to which you allude 
&amp; which I trust will cease when the nature of these periodical regulations of the balances is better known from practice.
