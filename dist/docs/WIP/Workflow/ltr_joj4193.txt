Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the papers which you were so obliging as 
to send me. Accept my thanks for them. Gratitude is 
due to those who employ their time and talents in promoting 
the common welfare. Your exertions to improve agriculture, and render it more productive, are known and acknowledged. The paper on " mildew in wheat," I have 
sent to New-York to be published. The multitude of 
interesting facts which have been collected during the last 
twenty years, doubtless furnish materials for a comprehensive system of husbandry ; such a work, ably executed, 
would be useful. 
</p><p>
Credit is also due to your endeavours to make known 
and excite attention to the means which conduce to health 
and longevity. The proposed edition of the code on these 
subjects, in one octavo volume, will be better calculated for 
general use and extensive circulation, than the larger work 
from which it is to be extracted. I hope it will soon be 
finished and find its way to this country. It must be an 
agreeable reflection to you, that you have been "diligent in 
well-doing." 
</p><p>
My health has for years been declining, and my age 
reminds me that the re-establishment of it is not to be expected. What you have written of the flesh-brush will 
induce me to use it more frequently. It can do no harm 
and may do good, and that is no inconsiderable recommendation. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes that your health and longevity 
may be such as to give additional weight to your remarks 
respecting them, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your faithful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
