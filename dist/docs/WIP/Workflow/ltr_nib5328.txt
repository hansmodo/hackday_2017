My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . The tide now has begun to turn, and the Bank 
has received to day a triumph such as it never enjoyed in any 
part of its career. You know that the stand taken by the Bank 
was, that it would not resume until the Govt. changed its 
course, as there could be no security for specie payments 
while the Gov't  itself made the distinction between specie &amp; 
notes. Accordingly the contest has literally been between 
the Bank &amp; the Executive. With what result you will see by 
the proceedings of yesterday when on the very same day the 
Specie Circular was repealed in the Senate by a vote of 34 to 
9, and in the House by 154 to 29. I have immediately endeavoured to justify the confidence of the country by issuing \ 
a note to <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> 1 in which suppressing all feelings of triumph, I merely announced the fact that we should now 
proceed to take measures for resumption. At the same time 
we resolved to yield to our <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> friends who wished us 
to have a Branch there under the new Banking law. This 
application is itself one of the most extraordinary symptoms 
of the good feeling which pervades the commercial community of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I send you an extract from the newspaper of to-day containing a notice of it, as well as my letter to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''><a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr. Adams</a></a> &amp; I will inclose, if they can be prepared in 
time, copies of the correspondence with <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> on the 
subject. 
</p><p>
I now mean to turn my immediate attention to making a simultaneous movement in the South &amp; West, so as to make the resumption really worth having &amp; I hope I to be able to rally up the whole country to an efficient exertion. 
</p><p>
The efforts made here to injure the Bank and which are 
echoed on your side, have ceased to have any effect here, &amp; 
the Bank will probably be in a more desirable situation than 
it ever was. 
</p><p>
I shall even not be very much surprized if some coquetting 
passes between our administration friends and the Bank, as 
we are in a singularly amiable humour. 
</p><p>
You know that Woodbury is appointed Chief Justice of 
New Hampshire &amp; leaves the Treasury, being in fact turned 
out in the shape of a resignation; so that according to Euro 
pean ideas, the President's ordinance being repealed, by both 
Houses of Congress, &amp; the Minister who issued it being dis 
missed, it may be regarded as a civil revolution on the side of 
the Bank.
