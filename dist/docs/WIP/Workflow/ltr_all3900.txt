SIR: 
</p><p>
It was with deep concern I viewed, on the proceedings of the last 
sessions of your Assembly, acts for amercing the property of some 
persons, and confiscating that of others, whose principles had attached 
them to the cause of their Sovereign. Yet, alarming as these public 
resolutions appeared, I was in hopes humanity, as well as policy, would 
have arrested their execution, and that I should not have been compelled to take measures for their counteraction, injurious to the country, 
and therefore painful to me; but when these hopes were disappointed, 
and I found the effects of the loyal and well-affected removed from their 
estates, and carried to parts far distant from them, I could no longer 
remain the quiet spectator of their distresses; but, in order to induce a 
more just line of conduct, have employed a part of the force intrusted to 
my charge for their protection, in seizing the negroes of your friends, 
that restitution may be thereby made to such of ours as may suffer 
under these oppressive and ruinous resolutions. This, sir, was the 
object of the late excursion towards Santee, and these principles will 
greatly mark the future operations of this army, unless a relinquishment of this assumed right on your part should justify less destructive 
measures on mine. To point out to you, or the world, the distinction 
between temporary sequestration and actual confiscation, would be im 
pertinence; but, will by no means be so to observe on the opposite con
duct, pursued by each party in carrying into execution these very different measures, for which you have endeavored to involve in perpetual 
ruin the persons and estates of those whose violent opposition to the 
King s Government compelled the withholding from them, for a time, 
their possessions in this province, for the great attention which has 
been invariably paid to their property the connected state in which it 
was preserved, and the liberal allowances that were made to their fami 
lies insomuch, that whilst other estates were running to waste by the 
distractions of the country, these have greatly thriven at the expense 
of Government. Thus far I have deemed it necessary to urge the 
motives of humanity, policy and example, for your suspension of such 
rigorous procedures; and should you think a meeting of Commissioners 
on each side might tend to lessen the devastations of war, and secure 
inviolate the property of individuals, I shall have a peculiar happiness 
in embracing proposals that may accomplish such benevolent purposes. 
But if, notwithstanding this earnest representation, you should still per 
severe in executing these Acts of your Assembly, I trust this letter will 
hold me justifiable to the world for any measures which necessity may 
adopt, in counteraction of steps unjust in their principles, and person 
ally distressing in their consequences; and that whilst I only endeavor 
to secure to those who, with respectable steadiness, have attached them 
selves to our cause, the full possession of their effects, or, in case of 
losses, to provide an equitable restitution for them, I shall be clearly 
exculpated from all the honors and calamities which the road you now 
point out unavoidably leads to. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obdt. and humble servant,
