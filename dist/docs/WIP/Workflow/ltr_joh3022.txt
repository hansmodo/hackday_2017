SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves of Congress, which I have 
the honor of transmitting, will naturally claim your 
attention, from their great importance. The regulation. relative to the payment of the troops and the 
department of the Paymaster-General will, I hope, be 
the means of introducing order and regularity into 
that part of the army, where, it must be confessed, 
they were extremely wanted. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> having laid before Congress the proceedings and sentence of a Court-Martial on a certain James Molesworth, who was accused and found 
guilty of being a spy, they immediately approved the 
same. He has since suffered the punishment due to 
his crime. From his repeated confession, it appears 
that Mr. Galloway was extremely active in engaging 
him to undertake this infamous business, and was 
the person employed to make the bargain with him. 
He says, indeed, Lord Howe was present; but, from 
the description he gave of his person, it is supposed 
he must be mistaken. 
</p><p>
The Congress have directed <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to take 
General Fermoy with him to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and such 
other French officers as he may think proper. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel=''>General St. Clair</a>, being ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, but previously 
to repair to this city to await the further order of 
Congress, you will please to direct him to repair here 
accordingly, as soon as possible. I have the honor to 
be, with the most perfect esteem and respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
