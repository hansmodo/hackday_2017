Dear Colonel, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your friendly letter of the 16th 
instant, and its enclosures, which contain useful as well as 
agreeable information. I am glad to see <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> doing 
something in the naval way, and think the encouragement 
given by your Convention to the manufacture of arms, 
powder, saltpetre, and sea salt, does them honour. 
</p><p>
Many of the reasons you allege for delaying taxation are 
weighty, and I confess did not occur to me. It is certainly 
unreasonable to impose on the city, in its present circumstances, so great a share of the public expenses. 
</p><p>
The late election, so far as it respects yourself, has taken 
a turn I did not expect, and am at a loss to account for, 
except on the principle of your holding a military office, or 
that mutability which from various causes often strongly 
marks popular opinions of men and measures in times like 
these. But whatever may have been the reason, I am persuaded that the zeal you have shown and the sacrifices you 
have made in this great cause will always afford you the 
most pleasing reflections, and will one day not only merit, 
but receive the gratitude of your fellow-citizens. Posterity 
you know always does justice. Let no circumstances of 
this kind diminish your ardour ; but by persevering in a 
firm, uniform course of conduct, silence detraction and 
compel approbation. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for your kind attention to my 
house ; and be assured that I shall omit no opportunity of 
evincing the esteem and sincerity with which I am 
Your friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
