My dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of yesterday, inclosing a letter from Stephorsts at Amsterdam, which 
served as a cover to a letter from my wife, of the 23 d 
October, in which she informs me that my uncle and 
family were shortly expected in London, to take leave 
of their friends, previous to setting out for the south 
of France. 
</p><p>
Deserters and inhabitants from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> say 
that there are no troops arrived there, except a few 
German convalescents from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Neither 
does it appear by their accounts that the large fleet 
mentioned by General Smallwood, which probably 
consists of victuallers and forage ships, is arrived yet 
at the city. 
</p><p>
Our commissioners proceeded yesterday morning 
to German Town according to agreement, and a strict 
neutrality and suspension of hostilities are to be 
observed in all the extent of the village during the 
conference. The English commissioners, I am in 
formed, returned to town last night. If they intend 
to do so every night, they will have the advantage of 
constant and more minute consultations with their 
principal. 
</p><p>
I must not omit to inform you that <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a> 
is making a sensible progress with our soldiers. The 
officers seem to have a high opinion of him, and 
discover a docility from which we may augur the 
most happy effects. 
</p><p>
It would enchant you to see the enlivened scene of 
our Campus Martins. If Mr. Howe opens the campaign with his usual deliberation, and our recruits or 
draughts come in tolerably well, we shall be infinitely 
better prepared to meet him, than ever we have been. 
</p><p>
Mr. Francis, who will deliver you this, takes charge likewise of your Carolina newspapers. 
</p><p>
He speaks of you in terms of such high respect, as are exceedingly grateful to one who is so devoted 
</p><p>
to you as your 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I inclose you a billet which I received this morning from Bringhurst.
