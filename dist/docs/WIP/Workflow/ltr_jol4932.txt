My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I was obliged to write briefly and in haste, by the 
last courier. I have since had several long conversations with the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>, who appears to me a 
man profound in the science of war, and well disposed 
to render his best services to the United States. In 
an interview between him and the general, at which I 
assisted in quality of interpreter, he declared that he 
had purposely waved making any contract with Congress, previous to his having made some acquaintance 
with the Commander in chief, in order that he might 
avoid giving offence to the officers of the army, and 
that the general might decide, in what post he could 
he the most useful. If I have conceived rightly of his 
character and abilities, he would make us an excellent 
quarter master general, in the military part of the 
department; his office being confined to the choice 
of positions, regulation of marches, etc. But as the 
civil and military duties with us are blended, he can t 
be disposed of in this way; his being a foreigner, 
unfitting him totally for the latter. I think he would 
be the properest man we could choose for the office 
of inspector general, and there are several good assist 
ants that might be given him. I have the highest 
opinion of the service he would render in this line, as 
he seems to be perfectly aware of the disadvantages 
under which our army has labored from short enlistments and frequent changes; seems to understand 
what our soldiers are capable of, and is not so staunch 
a systematist as to be averse from adapting established 
forms to stubborn circumstances. He will not give us 
the perfect instructions, absolutely speaking, but the 
best which we are in a condition to receive. We want 
some kind of general tutoring in this way so much, 
that as obnoxious as Conway is to most of the army, 
rather than take the field without the advantages that 
might be derived from a judicious exercise of his 
office, I would wish every motive of dissatisfaction 
respecting him for the present to be suppressed. 
</p><p>
The baron proposes to take the rank of major 
general, with the pay, rations, etc. He does not wish 
for any actual command, as he is not acquainted with 
our language and the genius of our people. 
</p><p>
It gives great uneasiness to hear it whispered that 
Congress will not probably ratify the arrangements 
proposed for the benefit of the army. If we had as 
much virtue as we ought to have, this would produce 
no dangerous change ; but according to the present 
interested ideas of men, many of our best officers will 
very likely retire from the service. 
</p><p>
The whole corps of officers look up to the commit 
tee of Congress, and anxiously wait the result of their 
recommendations. The most disinterested lament the 
delay, and tremble for the cause of their country. 
My dearest friend and father, adieu. 
</p><p>
I am your most affectionate 
</p><p>
