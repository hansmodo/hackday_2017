Sir, 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor of presenting to you some of those views, which the very delicate affair of the 
removal affords, and the result of a provisional inquiry which I set on foot. 
</p><p>
1. The charges have come in an ambiguous form, 
half private, half public \ and it must be uncertain, 
until the arrival of the new Minister from France, to 
what extent those charges are to be pressed. To 
seize so imperfect an opportunity for dismission, might 
argue an eagerness to get rid of the officer ; and, 
before such a stroke is given to the reputation of 
any man, ought he not to be heard ? 
</p><p>
2. I understand, however, that a middle ground 
has been recommended ; by exchanging the gentleman in question for another diplomatic resident. At 
first sight, this expedient has the advantage of being 
conciliatory, although, even in this particular, it may 
possibly fail. But what will be the reason given out 
to the world for such an alteration ? I here take it 
for granted, that if, on any such occasion, the Cabinet 
can conceal the genuine motive, on this it will be 
notorious. It will be known in France, and throughout the United States, that the disgust of the French 
Ministry at the hostility of our officer's politics was 
the leading cause of the decisive step. The people 
of the United States will immediately say, that he 
is not only protected in his misconduct, but that a 
partiality is discovered for his ideas on government, 
against which they are eminently inveterate, from 
their real sympathy with the revolution of France. 
Again; it will be difficult to satisfy the people of 
France, that it was consistent with an affectionate 
regard for their welfare, to send a Minister thus prejudiced against them, whom they assert to be "dangerous from his talents," to the Court of London, 
which has now probably become an avowed enemy 
to them. 
</p><p>
3. I doubt, therefore, exceedingly, whether any determination ought yet to be made ; especially as, during the recess of the Senate, you may remove, if you 
think proper. But I can scarcely doubt on the impropriety of the substitute proposed, considered relatively to the present time, although after circumstances may perhaps require these sentiments to be 
revised. 
</p><p>
4. Supposing the ultimate possibility of a dismission, I have labored, provisionally, to bring about the 
other arrangement. But I find this to be impracticable ; the one gentleman being immovable in the 
resolution which he expressed to you the other day, 
and the other gentleman being very explicit, that it 
is absolutely inadmissible, in his mind, to enter into 
the Administration under either of the aspects contemplated, or, indeed, under any other. 
</p><p>
I have the honor, &c., 
</p><p>
