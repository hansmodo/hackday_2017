Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
Since writing to you this morning it has occurred to me that you may have it in your power to do a great service to 
the Bank as well as to <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>. No man can now fail to perceive that the remarks on the Bank in the President's Message were unfortunate, &amp; have tended to make many sober 
men uneasy about the stability of our finances &amp; the soundness of our currency. As respects the Bank, it has gained 
friends by the reports in Congress &amp; by the general discussion 
of its affairs throughout the Country, so that at present I 
consider the Bank decidedly popular with the great mass of 
the Community. As a proof of it we have now before us no 
less than ten applications for branches one in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
one in Ohio, one in Virginia, two in South Carolina, one in 
Florida, one in Indiana, &amp; I believe that there is a decided 
majority in both houses of Congress favorable to it. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances the opposition to the President will naturally endeavor to turn the Bank question against 
him to represent him &amp; his friends as unfriendly to sound currency. 
</p><p>
In this the Bank will give of course no assistance. It means 
to be as it has been perfectly neutral &amp; unpartial minding 
its own business &amp; not medling with other people's &amp; no 
thing shall force it or seduce it from its strict line of duty. 
But it is worthy of great consideration for <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> &amp; 
his friends whether it would not be right for them to remove 
the impression of his &amp; their hostility to the Bank. I do not 
believe that <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> or his particular friends are hostile 
to the Bank. He expressed his doubts &amp; his belief about it. I 
am sure he was wrong, but I am equally sure that he was perfectly honest, &amp; if I do not much mistake his character he will 
if he thinks he has not done justice to the Bank in the first 
instance, be ready to do it ample justice when on more reflection &amp; examination he becomes satisfied that he can do 
so. This he will have a fine opportunity of doing &amp; at the same 
time of disarming his political antagonists of what they may 
make a powerful weapon at the next meeting of Congress. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> does not perhaps know (for persons in high 
stations do not always hear the whole truth) that the part 
of his Message which relates to the Bank has been a source 
of regret to many of his most attached friends &amp; to most if 
not all the political associates around him. He has now a 
fair x opportunity of converting that right into pleasure &amp; 
triumph. 
</p><p>
In his next message he will be able to state that since his last message nearly 10 millions of principal of the public 
Debt were paid off in January &amp; July. In his last message he was kind enough to speak with approbation of the agency 
of the Bank in making that payment without the least in convenience to the Country. Now, what I think his friends 
desire is that he should renew the expression of that approbation to the Bank it would perhaps be an act of justice 
and it would be an act both of justice &amp; policy to himself &amp; 
his friends by correcting an opinion that has gone abroad that he &amp; they are unfriendly to the Institution. He could say 
this without looking to the past or the future without committing himself or his friends &amp; the friends of the Bank 
would be gratified by such an evidence that his feelings were kindly towards the institution. This is a very simple &amp; 
easy thing to do &amp; yet I believe it would be very useful. Now how shall it be brought about? I have an idea that if 
any body can do it you can, &amp; if Judge Overton were disposed to aid he could be very useful. I submit the matter to 
your judgment to do what you may think right. I suggest it to you as a friend of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> &amp; a friend of the Bank 
believing that it would be useful to both but as I have made it a law not to interfere in political matters in case 
you should think the suggestion worth acting upon, you will have the goodness to do it without reference to me.
