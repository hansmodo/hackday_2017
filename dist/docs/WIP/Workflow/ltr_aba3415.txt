MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, being Sunday, I went with your father 
to the Foundling Church, Dr. Price, whom we 
usually attend, being absent a few weeks in the 
country. When I returned from church, I went 
into my closet and took up my pen, with an intention of writing to you ; but I really felt so triste at 
not having heard of your arrival, that I could not 
compose myself sufficiently to write to you ; so I 
scribbled to your brothers. By the time I had finished my letters, I was called to tea. Mr. Brown, 
the painter, came in and spent part of the evening. 
I read a sermon in Barrow upon the government of 
the tongue, and went to bed with one of my old impressions, that letters were near at hand.

This morning went below to breakfast ; the urn 
was brought up boiling ; the chocolate ready upon 
the table ; enter Mr. Spiller, the butler, who, by the 
way, is a very spruce body, and after very respectfully bowing with his hands full, " Mr. Church's 
compliments to you, Sir, and has brought you this 
packet, but could not wait upon you to-day, as he 
was obliged to go out of town." Up we all jumped ; 
your sister seized hold of a letter, and cried " My 
brother, my brother ! " We were not long opening 
and perusing, and " I am so glad," and " I am so glad," was repeated from one to another. Mamma 
did not fail remarking her old impression. The 
chocolate grew cold, the top of the tea-pot was forgotten, and the bread and butter went down uneaten. 
Yet nobody felt the loss of breakfast. So near akin 
are joy and grief, that the effect is often similar.

Our countrymen have most essentially injured 
themselves by running here in shoals after the 
peace, and obtaining a credit which they cannot 
support. They have so shackled and hampered 
themselves, that they cannot extricate themselves. 
Merchants, who have given credit, are now suffering, and that naturally creates ill-will and hard 
words. His Majesty and the ministry show every 
personal respect and civility which we have any 
right to expect. The Marquis de la Fayette writes, 
that he had always heard his Majesty was a great 
dissembler, but he never was so thoroughly convinced of it as by the reception given to the American Minister. I wish their conduct with regard to 
our country was of a piece with that which they 
have shown to its representative. The Marquis of 
Carmarthen and Mr. Pitt appear to possess the 
most liberal ideas with respect to us, of any part of 
the ministry. With regard to the negroes, they are 
full and clear that they ought to be paid for ; but, as 
to the posts, they say the relinquishment of them 
must depend upon certain other matters, which you 
know they were not at liberty to explain in private 
conversation ; but it is no doubt they mean to keep 
them as a security for the payment of the debts, 
and as a rod over our heads. They think we are 
as little able to go to war as they are. The budget 
has not yet been officially opened. A generous 
treaty has been tendered them, upon which they 
are now pondering and brewing. The fate of the 
Irish propositions has thrown weight into the American scale ; bat there are so many bones of contention between us, that snarling spirits will foment 
into rage, and cool ones kindle by repeated irritation. It is astonishing, that this nation catch at 
every straw which swims, and delude themselves 
with the bubble that we are weary of our independence, and wish to return under their government 
again. They are more actuated by these ideas in 
their whole system toward us, than by any generous 
plans, which would become them as able statesmen 
and a great nation. They think to effect their plans 
by prohibitory acts and heavy duties. A late act 
has passed, prohibiting the exportation of any tools 
of any kind. They say they can injure us much 
more than we can them, and they seem determined 
to try the experiment. Those, who look beyond the 
present moment, foresee the consequences, that this 
nation will never leave us until they drive us into 
power and greatness that will finally shake this 
kino-dom. We must struggle hard first, and find 
many difficulties to encounter, but we may be a 
great and a powerful nation if we will. Industry 
and frugality, wisdom and virtue, must make us so. 
I think America is taking steps towards a reform, 
and I know her capable of whatever she undertakes. 
I hope you will never lose sight of her interests ; 
but make her welfare your study, and spend those 
hours, which others devote to cards and folly, in investigating the great principles by which nations 
have risen to glory and eminence ; for your country 
will one day call for your services, either in the 
cabinet or field. Qualify yourself to do honor to 
her.

You will probably hear, before this reaches you, 
of the extraordinary affair respecting the Cardinal 
Rohan. It is said that his confinement is in consequence of his making use of the Queen's name to 
get a diamond necklace of immense value into his 
hands. Others say it is in consequence of some reflections cast upon the character of the Queen ; others 
suppose that the real fact is not known. I send you 
one newspaper account of the matter, and have not 
room to add more than that I am
