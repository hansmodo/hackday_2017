Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The observations you made in our walk yesterday were of so interesting a nature, that I hope you will excuse 
my recurring to the subject of them. About to enter on a scene where I may not be permitted long to remain merely a 
spectator, &amp; in which all my success will be influenced by my first steps, I feel a natural anxiety to prescribe a course of 
conduct which may become the rule of my political life. The 
violence of party x which disgraces our country is indeed discouraging to one who feels no disposition to become the follower of any sect, or to mingle political animosities with the intercourse of society. But I have sometimes thought that 
the interests of the nation might be advanced without joining those who think themselves exclusively its friends, and 
that even the intemperance of party would respect a manly independence founded on honor &amp; maintained with firmness 
without descending to adopt the prejudices or to be guided 
by the passions of others. You Sir more than any other character with whom it has been my happiness to be acquainted 
have passed thro all the stages of political advancement honorable for yourself &amp; useful to your country. From you 
therefore I am particularly desirous of receiving advice which would be useful to a person who like myself has a profession 
the pursuit of which is a primary object, but who from many motives aspires to any political distinction which may be acquired &amp; preserved by honorable means. 
</p><p>
The kindness &amp; confidence with which you have hitherto favored me as they are a principle inducement will I trust be at the same time the apology for this trouble.
