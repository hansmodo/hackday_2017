My dear Sir 
</p><p>
It strikes me that the resolutions of our legislature will 
place Mr. Dallas in an attitude equally new, and imposing ; 
offering an opportunity of distinction, which a young states 
man could scarcely hope for in his dreams, &amp; which the oldest 
statesman might pass a whole life without encountering. It 
seems to me, his position is precisely this He wishes to 
be the Pennsylvania candidate for the Vice Presidency and then 
</p><p>
"Glamis and thane of Cawdor 
"the greatest is believed." 
</p><p>
The Pennsylvanians are disposed to assist him and to exclude 
Mr. V Buren. To promote this Mr. Dallas should identify 
himself with all the Pennsylvania interests, more especially 
those interests to which <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Van Buren</a> is supposed to be 
hostile. He should therefore go immediately to the President 
with these resolutions of Penn. 1 in his hand he should 
warn him against irritating our State, especially as the of 
fence to her is wholly gratuitous. He should say to him you 
are not opposed to this bank essentially; you mean to agree 
to it with certain modifications. Now let me mediate between 
you and the Bank; let us agree on the modifications; the Bank 
will consent to them, and I will report them, the rechartering 
of the Bank will thus become a measure of yours you will 
gratify Penn a . you will take from your adversaries their 
most formidable weapon, and secure the ascendancy of your 
friends. If the President will do this his success is certain, if Mr. Dajlas will do this, besides sustaining his father's work 
&amp; conferring a great blessing on the Country, he will assure/ 
to himself distinguished consideration through the nation. 
</p><p>
I do not know how he is disposed for such an enterprize, but he ought to give ten years of his life for this chance of attaining it. Tell him so, and if in half an hour afterwards he is not 
on his way to the Presidents, why then the stars have conjoined for him in vain.
