Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 5th inst. Mr, Norris gave me your obliging letter of the 20th September last. I regret that he did not come 
here sooner, for it will always give me pleasure to have 
opportunities of evincing my esteem and regard for you, 
by attention to those who possess yours. Mr. Carmichael, 
whom I had long expected with the public accounts, did 
not arrive until the 27th ult. ; when Mr. Ridley had just 
gone to England, and Mr. Barclay, who had been long there, was and still is absent. Nothing but the settlement of 
those accounts now detains me here, and a mortifying detention it is, considering that the best season for being at sea 
is passing away. While I stay, Mr. Norris shall perceive 
that he could have brought few recommendations to me so 
acceptable as yours, and those amiable qualities for which 
you commend him. I wish he may return as uncorrupted 
as he came. Paris is a place better calculated for the improvement of riper years ; and in my opinion, very young 
men should not visit it. Our country has already sent 
some here, who will return the worse for their travels. I 
hope your young friend may escape. If he should, you 
may congratulate him on having made the choice of Hercules, for he will be tempted. On the 1st instant, I received 
your favour of January last, by Colonel Harmar. J flatter 
myself that the delays attending the ratification of the 
treaty will not occasion difficulties ; especially as one of the 
ministers who made the peace is now at the head of the 
British administration. If European commercial restrictions produce unanimity, and tend to raise a national spirit 
in our country, which probably will be the case, I shall 
think them blessings. It is time for us to think and act like 
a sovereign, as well as a free people, and by temperate and 
steady self-respect to command that of other nations. It is 
but too much the fashion to depreciate Congress, and I fear 
that, as well as many other of our new fashions, will cost 
us dear.

Be pleased to present our compliments to Mrs. Thorn p-. 
son. With great and sincere regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
John' Jay,
