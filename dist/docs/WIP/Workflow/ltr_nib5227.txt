My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... I do not incline to fear anything for the Bank 
from the change of Administration. <a href='/results.php?tla=rir' rel='colleague'>Mr Rush's</a> excellent 
report sets the seal upon that question, &amp; I should think that 
no administration would venture to set the monied concerns 
of the country afloat as they once were. When we see who is 
to be our new Secy of the Treas'y, we can consider seriously 
the application for a renewal. . . .
