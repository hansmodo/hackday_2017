Sir, 
</p><p>
The attention, which several pressing affairs required, made 
it impossible for me sooner to answer the letter, which 
you did me the honor of writing to me on the 14th. I 
have examined, with respectful care, the decree of the 9th of 
May, emanating from the conduct of your enemies, and sup 
ported by some reasons to which you have given their 
greatest lustre. 
</p><p>
It is possible, Sir, that the difference of our position leads 
us to see the same object in a different manner. But although 
T cannot be of your opinion, I do not intend farther to discuss 
the considerations, which have produced the decision of the 
French government. I confine myself to the rendering of a 
faithful account of it to the government of the United States, 
and I am persuaded that in considering them, liberal friend 
ship will put in the balance the difficulties of a revolution, and 
of a war without example. 
</p><p>
I ought, however, to observe to you, Sir, that the question 
does not appear to me to turn on the law of nations, but on an 
exception to that law, by the stipulations of a treaty. This 
treaty, in derogating from this law, in favor of merchandizes of 
your enemies found in our vessels, has derogated, in like manner, from it, to the prejudice of our merchandizes found in the 
vessels of your enemies. We have seen at Philadelphia the 
public sale of a cargo, the property of one of our citizens, taken by a French privateer on board an English vessel. All 
opposition was of no avail, because, according to the constitution, our treaties are the supreme law of the land. You will 
agree, Sir, that it is hard for my fellow citizens not to have 
the advantage either of the treaty or of the law of nations ; to 
lose their merchandizes by the treaty, and not to be able to 
compensate themselves for it, under the protection of this same 
treaty, by the freight of enemy's merchandizes. In comparing 
the facts of the same epoch, you will be amazed on seeing 
what passed at Paris and at Philadelphia. Your good sense 
will lead you to anticipate the claims of our merchants, and 
the insinuations of our enemies. I have the honor to be, &LC.
