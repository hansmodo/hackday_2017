Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Although I am much pressed for time, and consequently 
cannot indulge myself in the pleasure of a long conversation, I 
must pay you a visit, and say how do you do, while I deliver 
the packages, which Mr Jefferson is so kind as to entrust to 
my care. I will not have the assurance, with his dispatches in 
my hand, to say a word about politics. And more especially, 
as he has not only the advantage, by frequent access to the 
ministers, of seeing more distinctly those movements, which 
others contemplate at a distance ; but also because he is very 
much in the confidence of the patriotic party here, and consequently well informed of their views and intentions.

If, in the course of my observations, anything should turn 
up worthy of notice, I will seize an early opportunity to make 
the communication. But my present opinion is, that until 
some time after the States- General shall have assembled, this 
government will offer little or nothing for the contemplation of 
your department. If any new lesson were wanting to impress 
on our hearts a deep sense of the mutability of human affairs, the double contrast between France and America two years 
ago, and at the present moment, will surely furnish that important lesson. 
</p><p>
I trust that my country, in proportion as she acquires dignity by wise and honest measures, will show to others the respect and attention, which, while they flatter and conciliate the 
weak on whom they are bestowed, shed lustre on the greatness from which they emanate. I wish but why attempt to 
express those hopes and wishes, which constantly swell my 
heart for her prosperity ? To read or write them all would 
tire both you and me ; besides, it is a useless task, for I am persuaded you will find them all in your own bosom. I am, etc.
