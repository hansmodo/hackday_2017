DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I feel myself doubly honored by your favor of the 
14th instant, from the confidence of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> in the free communication of his sentiments, 
and in the coincidence of his ideas with my own 
upon a question, upon the wise decision of which the 
inheritance, possibly the establishment of the freedom 
and independence of these States, seem to depend. 
The respect, Sir, that I owe you demands an immediate reply, and yet the variety of avocations in 
which I am engaged does not afford me moments for 
arranging or expressing my thoughts suitably to the 
importance of the subject. I am, nevertheless, encouraged to proceed, without hesitation, from a conviction that, were I to deliver my opinions at full 
length, I should be obliged to borrow your Excellency's words, which I have the honor of assuring 
you, Sir, are, in more than one instance, repetitions 
of my own, and that in every other, one excepted, 
our sentiments on this momentous discussion exactly 
accord. 
</p><p>
I believe, and upon good ground, the scheme for 
an expedition into Canada, in concert with the arms 
of France, originated in the breast of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel=''>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, encouraged, probably, by conferences with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>, and I also believe it to be the off 
spring of the purest motives, so far as respects that 
origin; but this is not sufficient to engage my concurrence in a measure big with eventual mischiefs. 
As deeply as my very limited time and faculties had 
suffered me to penetrate, I had often contemplated 
our delicate connection with France ; and, although it 
is painful to talk of one's own foresight; had viewed 
and foretold, fifteen months ago, the humiliating state 
to which our embryo independence would be reduced 
by courting from that nation the loan of more money 
than should be actually necessary for the support of 
the army and of our unfortunate navy. 
</p><p>
I was one of the six unsuccessful opponents to the 
resolution for borrowing money from France for paying the interest of our Loan-Office certificates. We 
have, in this single article, plunged the Union into a 
vast amount of debt; and, from neglecting to exert 
our very small abilities, or even to show a leading disposition to cancel any part of the former demand 
against us, our bills for that interest are now floating, 
in imminent danger of dishonor and disgrace. Fully 
persuaded of the true value of national honor, I 
anxiously wished to support our own by a propriety 
and consistency of conduct, and I dreaded the consequences of subjecting our happiness to the disposal 
of a powerful creditor, who may, upon any specious 
grounds, interpret national honor to our destruction. 
I warned my friends against the danger of mortgaging these States to foreign powers. Every million 
of livres you borrow implies a pledge of your lands ; 
and it is optional in your creditor to be repaid at 
the Bank of England, with an exorbitant premium, 
or to collect the money due to him in any of your ports, and according to his own mode, whenever national interest shall require the support of pretended 
national honor. 
</p><p>
Hence your Excellency will perceive what were 
my feelings, when the propositions for subduing Canada, by the aid of a French fleet and army, were 
first broached to me. I demurred exceedingly to the 
Marquis's scheme, and expressed some doubts of the 
concurrence of Congress. This was going as far as 
I dared, consistently with my office, or considering 
him as a gentleman of equal honor and tenacity. 1 
trusted the issue of his application to the sagacity 
of Congress; the business was referred to a Commit 
tee., who conferred with the Marquis; their report 
was framed agreeably to his wishes; but the House 
very prudently determined to consult the Commander-in-chief previously to a final determination; and al 
though your Excellency's observations are committed, 
I am much mistaken if every member in Congress is 
not decided in his opinion in favor of them. If the 
prosecution of so extensive an object is, from the 
present state of our army and funds, impracticable 
on our part, it becomes altogether unnecessary to 
discuss the point in a political view. And I trust 
the Marquis will be satisfied with such reasonings, in 
apology for our desisting from the pursuit of his favorite enterprise, as our circumstances will dictate. 
</p><p>
The immense debts which we are involved in, 
abroad and at home, demand the utmost serious attention, and call for an exertion of the collected wisdom of all these States, in order to secure what we 
have saved from the ravages of the enemy. I am 
very short-sighted if there be, at this time, any encouragement for attempting distant conquests. I have 
been uniformly averse from every proposition which 
is intended to dissipate our strength and to accumu 
late our debt. Events have confirmed my opinion; 
and at this instant, taking in view all circumstances, 
I have doubts of the policy, and more of the success, 
of the pending expedition against East Florida. Congress will probably recommend to the States to raise a tax of near twenty millions the ensuing year. This, 
I hope, will have a good effect, by returning many 
of us to first principles, from which we have been too 
long wandering. This almost intolerable burden will 
rouse and animate our fellow-citizens ; they will probably send men of ability to investigate causes, to 
inquire into expenditures, and to call delinquents for 
unaccounted millions to severe reckonings ; they will 
do, what they have hitherto shamefully neglected, pass 
necessary laws for this purpose. 
</p><p>
This heavy tax, and the prospect of increasing impositions, will show our constituents the necessity for 
consolidating our strength, as well as the impropriety 
and danger of new extensive military enterprises. 
Virtue and patriotism were the motto of our banners, 
when we entered this contest. Y/here is virtue, 
where is patriotism, now; when almost every man 
has turned his thoughts and attention to gain and pleasures, practising every artifice of change-alley, or 
Jonathans ; when men of abilities disgracefully neglect the important duties for which they were sent 
to Congress, tempted by the pitiful fees of practising 
attorneys; when members of that body artfully start a point, succeed, and then avail themselves of the 
secrets of the House, and commence monopolizers, 
and accumulate the public debt for their private 
emoluments ? I believe many such tricks have been 
acted. The particular instance which I allude to cost 
these States a large sum of money without putting 
the criminal to the expense of a blush. When men, 
in almost every important public department, are actually concerned in commerce, incompatible with the 
strict duties of their respective officers; when the most 
egregious delinquents meet with support in Congress, 
and escape examination. I am tired, and fear tiring 
you, Sir, with this horrible, half-finished picture. 1 
will therefore leave it, but not before I add that the 
United States of America are in most deplorable circumstances ; that the requisitions of a foreign Minister 
have fixed the eyes of Europe upon them; that their 
weaknesses, their wickednesses, are no longer hidden, 
and that the States respectively are much to blame, 
and that, without speedy reformation, their shame 
and ruin collectively will follow. 
</p><p>
The disaster of Admiral Byron's fleet, and the 
successful departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel=''>Count D Estaing</a>'s, are events 
much in our favor; that is to say, if we are pleased 
to make a wise improvement of them; but, from experience fearing the contrary, I am almost tempted 
to wish they had not happened. These fortunate circumstances will lull us to sleep again, and, while ourally is gaining honor, aggrandizement, and the highest national advantages, we shall be sinking into a 
state little better than tributary and dependent. Be 
this as it may, the world will ever honor by acknowledging the virtues of the man, who, from my inmost 
soul, I believe keeps us at this moment from crumbling. I have the honor to be, with the most sincere 
respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your much obliged and obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
