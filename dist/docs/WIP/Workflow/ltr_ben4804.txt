SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your several Favours of Oct. 9. and December 13. inclosing Bills of Exchange, viz. On which are paid and carried to the Credit of the Province 
Account. I am much obliged to you and the Assembly 
for so readily transmitting them; and it makes me very 
happy to understand that my Endeavours in their Service are 
in any degree acceptable. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the ample Recommendations brought 
over by M r Winter, the Bishop of London has refused him 
Ordination, for two Reasons, as I understand, his mechanical 
Education, and his Connection with M r Whitefield & the 
Methodists. I did not think either of these of so much 
Weight as to discourage me from attempting to get him 
ordain'd by some other Bishop of London as might overcome 
his Lordship's Objections. Accordingly I endeavoured 
to engage in his Favour the Associates of D r Bray, a Society 
of which I have long been a Member. As it was established 
for Purposes similar to that of M r Louberbuhler's Will, I 
hope they would readily have afforded us the Weight of their 
Recommendation, or my laying before them a Copy of the 
Will, Copies of several Letters from you and M r Flabersham, 
&c. But the Idea of his being a Methodist, and the Imagination of his neglecting the Negroes and becoming an Itinerant Preacher, disturbing regular Congregations, &c. &c. 
as soon as he should obtain Ordination, I found were thought 
sufficient Reason to prevent their concerning themselves in 
the Affair. However I do not yet quite despair of it. 
</p><p>
Mentioning M r Whitefield, I cannot forbear expressing the 
Pleasure it gave me to see in the Newspapers an Account of 
the Respect paid to his Memory by your Assembly. I knew 
him intimately upwards of thirty years. His Integrity, 
Disinterestedness, and indefatigable Zeal in prosecuting every 
good Work, I have never seen equalled, I shall never see exceeded. 
</p><p>
The enclosed Paper has been put into my Hand by M r Maudit, a principal Man among the Dissenters here. I 
promised him to communicate it to you. The Dissenters 
were for complaining to Government, and petitioning for 
Redress; but M r Maudit advis'd that M r Frink should first 
be written to, as possibly he might be dissuaded from persisting in such Demands. I know nothing of the Circumstances 
but what appears in the Paper, nor am I acquainted with 
your Laws; but I make no doubt you will advise what is 
proper and prudent to be done in the Affair. The Dissenters 
in those Northern Colonies where they are predominant, 
have by Laws exempted those of the Church of England residing among them from all Rates and Payments toward the 
Support of the Dissenting Clergy ; and methinks it would be 
a Pity to give them a Handle against re-enacting those Law 
when they expire ; for they are temporary, and their perpetual 
Laws tax all Sects alike. The Colonies have Adversaries 
enow to their common Privileges : They should endeavour to 
agree among themselves, and avoid everything that may 
make Ill-Blood and promote Divisions, which must weaken 
them in their common Defence. 
</p><p>
If the Laws of your Province are printed, I should wish to 
be furnished with a Copy; it must be sometimes of Use to 
me in the Management of your Business. 
</p><p>
With great Esteem and Respect, I have the Honour to be, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
humble Servant 
</p><p>
B FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall shortly write fully to the Committee relating 
to the Matters referr'd in the Letter of May 23, '70 in the 
mean time be so good as to inform them that the Business has 
not been neglected. The Hurry in our Public Councils during 
the first Part of the Winter, occasion'd by the Expectation 
of an immediate foreign War, and the domestic Confusion 
that took place after the Convention, have been great Hindrances to proceeding in American Affairs.
