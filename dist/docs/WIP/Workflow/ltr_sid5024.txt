Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
Just as I had closed my despatches by the Generals de Coudray and Baron de Kalb, I was most agreeably 
surprised with a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>, at Nantes, where he arrived, after thirty days passage, with two prizes. I 
hourly expect him here, but knowing of his arrival, I despatch this with a duplicate to Havre de Grace, to go 
by the ships sailing thence, and have only time to inform you, that I sent an express instantly to j\Ir Lee to join us 
here without delay, for the news of <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr Franklin</a>'s arrival may occasion his friends being forbid coming from London 
to France. Nothing has, for a long time, occasioned greater speculation than this event, and our friends here are 
elated beyond measure, as this confirms them you will not negotiate with England ; and for me, I will not attempt to 
express the pleasure I feel on this occasion, as it removes at once difficulties under which I have been constantly in 
danger of sinking. I may not add, as I shall miss the post, but am, with the most grateful and respectful compliments to the Congress, &lc.

P. S. The King of Portugal is dead. The Comte Grimaldi, Prime Minister of Spain, has resigned, which 
will tend to accelerate a rupture in Europe, which I think unavoidable.
