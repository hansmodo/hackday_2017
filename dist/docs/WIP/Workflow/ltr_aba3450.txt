DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge the receipt of the raspberry 
bushes, and the pot of strawberry vines, for which 
accept my thanks. I have had them placed in a 
good part of the garden, and shall pay particular 
attention to them. I hope I shall be able to treat you 
with a plate of them, when I shall have the pleasure 
of seeing you at <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 
</p><p>
Whatever strange events occur in the political 
world, I think your path plain ; the strict and impartial discharge of the duties of your office, with a 
prudent silence, without becoming the demagogue 
of any party. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to send the enclosed by a safe 
hand. My love to Mrs. Smith and the children. 
Tell her I have commenced my operations of dairywoman; and she might see me, at five o'clock in the 
morning, skimming my milk. Adieu, my dear Sir. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
