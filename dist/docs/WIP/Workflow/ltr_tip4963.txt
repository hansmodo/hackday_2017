SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter, 
by Colonel Lee, conferring upon me the office of Adjutant-General. And since, notwithstanding all my objections, 
tis your Excellency's pleasure, I am happy to declare my 
acceptance of it. At the same time, I am constrained, 
from my real feelings, again to express my fears that I shall 
fall short of your Excellency's expectations. Few people 
are competent judges of military abilities ; and most are 
apt to form their opinions very superficially. Hence I have 
as often been mortified as pleased by the favorable sentiments which some have expressed concerning me, conscious 
that many times I did not merit their applause. I know 
not who have recommended me to your Excellency ; I wish 
they may not have judged too favorably of my abilities. 
However, I am determined to exert myself to the utmost 
to serve your Excellency and my country ; and if, after all, 
I fail of executing the office with propriety, seeing I at first 
declined it, partly from an apprehension of inability, your 
Excellency will acquit me of presumption in accepting it at 
your repeated request. My affairs are complicated, but I 
will prepare to attend you with all possible despatch. General Glover accepts the post assigned him, aud we shall 
doubtless go to head-quarters together. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING, JR.
