Upon your arrival at Crown Point, you will proceed with the fleet of the United States under your command, down Lake 
Champlain, to the narrow pass of the Lake made by the Split 
Rock, or to the other narrow approach down the Lake, made 
by Isle-aux-Tetes and the opposite shore. You will station the 
fleet in the best manner to maintain the possession of those 
passes, according as your judgment shall determine, cautiously 
avoiding to place the vessels in a manner, which might unnecessarily expose them to the enemy's heavy artillery from the 
shore. You will most religiously observe, that it is my positive 
order that you do not command the fleet to sail below the pass 
of the Isle-aux-Tetes, above mentioned, incessantly reflecting, 
that the preventing the enemy's invasion of our country is the 
ultimate end of the important command with which you are 
now intrusted. It is a defensive war we are carrying on ; 
therefore no wanton risk or unnecessary display of the power 
of the fleet is at any time to influence your conduct. 
</p><p>
Should the enemy come up the Lake, and attempt to force 
their way through the pass you are stationed to defend, in that 
case you will act with such cool, determined valor, as will 
give them reason to repent their temerity. But if, contrary to 
my hope and expectation, their fleet should have so increased 
as to force an entrance into the upper part of the Lake, then, 
after you shall have discovered the insufficiency of every effort 
to retard their progress, you will, in the best manner you can, 
retire with your squadron to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. Every vessel in the 
fleet being furnished with a bateau, you will have it in your 
power to keep out scout-boats at night, and occasionally to annoy the enemy's small craft. In the daytime your boats can 
act, when opportunity offers, under cover of the cannon of your 
fleet. 
</p><p>
As the most Honorable the Congress of the United States 
rest a great dependence on your wise and prudent conduct in 
the management of this fleet, you will on no account detach 
yourself from it, upon the lesser services above mentioned. A 
resolute but judicious defence of the northern entrance into this 
side of the Continent, is the momentous part which is commit 
ted to your courage and abilities. I doubt not you will secure 
it from further invasion. 
</p><p>
As I am entirely unacquainted with marine affairs, I shall 
not presume to give any directions respecting the duty and Discipline of the seamen and marines on board the fleet. 
</p><p>
I have traced the great outline of that service which your country expects from the rank and character you have acquired. 
I have, as is my duty, fixed the limits beyond which you are 
not to go. But you must communicate that restriction to no 
body. I wish, on the contrary, that words, occasionally dropped 
from you with that prudence which excludes every sort of affectation, and which I believe you possess, may, together with 
all your motions, induce our own people to conclude it is our 
real intention to invade the enemy, which, after all, may hap 
pen. It will keep up their spirits, without affecting your reputation, whatever may be the event. 
</p><p>
It only remains for me to recommend you to the protection 
of that Power, upon whose mercy we place our hopes of freedom here, and of happiness hereafter. You will frequently report the state and situation of your fleet, and of every interesting occurrence.
