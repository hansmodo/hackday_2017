Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the sixteenth of January, of which I now 
enclose a copy. It has so happened that a very great pro 
portion of the French officers, who served in America, have 
been either opposed to the revolution at an early day, or felt 
themselves obliged at a later period to abandon it. Some of 
them are now in a state of banishment, and their property confiscated. Among these last there are a few, who had entrusted 
to their agents the certificates received from our treasury, and 
these last under the pressure of penal decrees either detain 
those certificates, or have delivered them up to those persons 
appointed by the republic to take charge of confiscated property. 
</p><p>
There certainly can be no question on this subject, under 
the laws hitherto existing among nations ; but I shall not undertake to decide either on rights or pretensions to right, 
especially where I am not authorised to act ; but it is proper 
that I should lay before you a state of facts, for your ulterior 
decision. The only one at present before me is the case of 
Colonel Laumoy, to whom I shall write in answer to his ap 
plications, that I am not authorised to make payment but on 
production of the certificate, and therefore he must address 
himself on the subject to you, in the full confidence that right 
and justice will take place, such being the clear determination 
of the United States. I am, &tc.
