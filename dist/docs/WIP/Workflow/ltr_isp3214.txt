DEAR GOVERNOR, 
</p><p>
As I am informed by your brother, General James Clinton, with 
whom I had the pleasure to dine to-day, that you were at <a href='/results.php?city=pleasant valley' rel='city'>Pleasant Valley</a>, this waits on you to desire your advice and counsel at 
head-quarters, with all convenient despatch, upon some interesting 
matters, as the enemy have evacuated <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, Fort Montgomery, and all adjacent posts, and gone down the river with their 
whole fleet. With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
