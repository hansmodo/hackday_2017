Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to enclose a letter and sundry papers relating to it, from Messieurs Shweizer, Jeannerst & Co. I have 
referred these gentlemen to Mr Short, telling them that it is 
most fitting in many respects that they should apply to him. 
</p><p>
As it is possible, however, that this business may come before 
you, I think it a duty to convey some observations which occur 
to me, and which may not perhaps strike you, because matters 
of that sort have not, I believe, much occupied your attention. 
Previous thereto I beg leave, however, to give you a history of 
my acquaintance with it. In a letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, of the 
31st of January, <a href='/results.php?year=1790'>1790</a>, I mentioned what had passed between M. 
Necker and me respecting the debt due by the United States to 
France, and I hinted the means of turning to useful account a 
very precipitate step of the public agents in Holland. About 
this time I received your orders to communicate with the British 
ministers, and although I did by no means consider that in the of duty on American ships, without any particular object except to 
punish Lafayette. This may seem a strange reason, but it is a true 
one. The Aristocrats, as such, are his enemies, and those who wished 
to preserve the valuable revenue upon tobacco were mortified, at seeing it thrown away in the manner I have related. Some of my particular acquaintances in the Assembly, to whom I mentioned the ill 
policy of these decrees, assured me that they would not have been 
passed had <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, who was present, opposed them ; 
but he being there, they left him to step forward, it being as it were his 
particular business ; and he being silent, they were taken by surprise , 
whereas had he been absent they would certainly have made head, and 
obtained an adjournment at least. The exclusion of our ships, also, 
from being admitted as French bottoms, arises from the same desire to 
show that his support of America is useless, and at the same time they 
have circulated that he prefers America to France, in consequence of 
which he is afraid to do anything pointed, lest he should lose his 
popularity. 
light of an appointment to office, yet from motives of delicacy I 
determined to extricate myself from the affairs of the debt, as 
speedily as I could with propriety. Various applications were 
made to me from different quarters, to which I replied evasively ; but in my arrival in this city last November, I informed the parties that I had reasons of a private nature, which deter 
red me from holding any share in their speculation. I con 
versed with Mr Short on the same subject, and communicated 
to him confidentially my reasons for declining an interest, as 
well as my opinion respecting the use which might be derived 
from such negotiation. 
</p><p>
A few days after the President of the Committee of Finance, 
happening to meet me at the Count de Montmorin s, mentioned some proposals then before them, which to the best of my 
remembrance were extravagant I declined giving an opinion 
without previously seeing and considering the terms, upon 
which he and M. de Montmorin agreed together, that before 
anything was concluded the various propositions which might 
be made should be submitted to my examination. Here the 
thing dropped, and the enclosed papers show the reason why, 
for it appears from them that a bargain was made shortly after 
by the Controleur General with a different company. Mr Short mentioned this to me on his return hither in the end of 
March, telling me that the parties concerned were, as he was 
informed in Amsterdam, men of no credit nor capital. I of 
course agreed with him in opinion, that if so, it was not worth 
while to listen to them. 
</p><p>
A few days after one of them called on me, and after giving a history of the affair, begged me to make use of my good 
offices. I told him at once that it was ridiculous to ask a com 
mission of five per cent on changing the nature of our debt. 
That it was quite as convenient to owe France as to owe the 
subjects of France ; and further, that before any treaty was offered, persons of credit and capital should appear. As soon 
as I made this last observation, he drew out the letter of the 
Comptroller General, and showing me the second clause of it, replied; that after what was there contained no man had a right 
to question the solidity of the society. He then added, that 
for my private satisfaction he would prove that people of the 
first fortune were connected therein, and indeed he gave me 
such proof. I told him upon this, that they must apply to 
Mr Short, or to their own ministry, whose support would be 
much more efficacious than the sentiments of any private individual. I mentioned nevertheless to Mr Short, the substance 
of this conversation. While he was in the country the enclosed letter was received. He returned to town yesterday, and 
called on me in the evening, when I communicated to him the 
purport of it. 
</p><p>
I have ever been of opinion, that as we are not in condition 
to pay our debt to France, a bargain by which the period can 
be prolonged, without loss to either party, is desirable. I say 
without loss, because the conduct of this nation has been so 
generous to us, that it would be very ungrateful indeed to take 
advantage of those necessities, which the succor afforded to 
America has occasioned. Such bargain must be either with 
the government or with individuals. But after the repeated 
delays on our part, to ask longer time would not look well. 
Indeed no such treaty could be made without the consent of 
the Assembly, and their observations would not be pleasant. 
A bargain with individuals has the advantage of bringing in 
the aid of private interest to the support of our credit, and 
what is of very great consequence, it would leave us at liberty 
to make use of that credit for the arrangement of our domestic 
affairs. And on this head I must mention to you, my dear 
Sir, that it has been my good fortune to prevent some publications, which would have been particularly injurious to us. 
Their object was to complain of the United States for speculating in their own effects with the funds of France ; urging that 
while we owed heavy instalments already due here, all the 
loans we obtain in Holland ought to be applied to the discharge of them, and therefore that the speculations in our domestic debt were a double violation of good faith, &ic. &c. 
The present state of things here has occasioned so great a 
fall in the exchange, that money borrowed in Holland is remitted with great gain, consequently loans made there just 
now answer well, and it is evident that the parties, who are 
endeavoring to contract, count on a considerable profit from 
that circumstance. Much however is to be said on this part 
of the subject. 
</p><p>
First, it is questionable whether our reputation may not be 
a little affected, for you will recollect that about one third of 
our debt to France arose from a loan made on our account in 
Holland of five millions of florins, for which the King paid us here 
ten millions of livres, without any deduction for charges of any 
sort. The nation is now obliged to pay this five millions in 
Holland, and for us to borrow that amount there, and then 
squeeze them in an exchange, which distresses both their commerce and finances, looks hard. There was a good deal of 
murmuring about it when the last operation of 1,500,000 guilders took place, and I should not be at all surprised if some 
patriot, by way of showing his zeal, should make a violent at 
tack in the Assembly when the next payment is made. There 
are many of these patriots, who if they can inculpate ministers 
and distress those of different sentiments, do not care a jot for 
consequences. 
</p><p>
But supposing this not to happen, it is not possible for a 
nation to make the advantage, which individuals do in such 
things, because they must employ individuals, each of whom 
will be too apt to look a little to his own advantage. There is 
a difference also between the gain made upon parts, and that 
which would arise on the whole, for even if we could borrow all 
at once so large a sum, there can be no doubt that the remittance of it hither would greatly alter the exchange. But it is 
not possible to borrow it speedily, and the present unnatural 
state of things will, in all probability, be changed. In fact the 
leading characters are very seriously alarmed at it. If their 
paper currency should be either redeemed, or annihilated, 
or abolished tomorrow, the exchange would immediately turn 
in favor of France, and then we should lose on remittances. 
</p><p>
So much for this affair in its little details ; but there is a 
great view of it, which forcibly strikes my mind. If we were at 
liberty to turn all our efforts towards our domestic debt, we 
should by raising its value prevent speculations, which are very 
injurious to the country, if not to the government. Millions 
have already been bought at a low price, and afterwards negotia 
ted in Europe. Neither is that all, for if we can borrow at 
five per cent and buy up our six per cent debt at par, we gain 
at once by that operation one fifth of the interest, or twenty per 
cent, which, besides all the other good consequences, is much 
more than ever we shall get by any management of our debts 
on this side of the water. 
</p><p>
I have given you, my dear Sir, these hints in abridgement, 
because my time will not admit of dilating them ; attribute them, 
I pray you, to the true cause, and believe me always very sincerely yours,
