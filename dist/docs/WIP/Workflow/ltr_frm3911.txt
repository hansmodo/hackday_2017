SIR: 
</p><p>
I am posted here, two miles in front of the Continental army, within 
three-quarters of a mile of the above bridge. The General, according 
to custom, keeps me between him and the enemy. By what I can 
learn, we shall not move from here until the army move. Gen. Pickens 
brigade is here under me; Capt. Gee's men are come here. You will 
relieve those at Cat Island by some other men. I hope by this you 
</p><p>
have received the arms. Send me by the first opportunity a general 
return of your corps, of men, horses, saddles and arms; as you have 
all the officers except Maxwell, you cannot be at a loss. If any officers 
or men are on a furlough, you must call them in, and give no more leave 
of absence on any account. I shall send a waggon for rum, sugar and 
coffee; please get it ready for me. This place is a starving hole, where 
nothing can be had, and nothing can be expected but hard knocks. 
Gen. O'Hara and seventeen empty transports are arrived, and Gen. 
Leslie is going away, said for Jamaica. Deserters just come in say 
they are levelling their works, and are to contract their garrison ; some 
say part of the troops are going with <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Leslie</a>. I wrote you in 
my last that you may do as you please with Shad's daughter. Tell 
Capt. Roux he is retained in the service, and is in the second regiment. 
I have not time to write him. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
