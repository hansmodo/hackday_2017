SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday with the cavalry, where I 
expected to have found forage sufficient to subsist the 
cavalry, at least for a few days. My Brigade Forage-master had been informed, by Colonel Biddle, that such 
provision was made, and that he would have nothing 
more to do than issue the same ; but, so far to the 
contrary, there was not a load of hay in town. With 
the greatest difficulty we have "been enabled to put 
our heads under cover. I applied to the civil magistrates for directions relative to the forming a magazine. In the mean while, the horses must subsist. I 
am, therefore, obliged to divide them into several 
squads, and send them out about two miles in the 
rear of the town, until the necessary provision, both 
for forage and quarters, can be made. 
</p><p>
It will be impossible for me to quarter the cavalry 
in this place, unless the galley-men are removed ; but 
they say they have an order from the Governor and 
Council to remain here ; and, having prior possession, 
think they are entitled to hold it. I wait your Excellency's positive order in what manner to proceed; 
and if, in this case, I must execute my first orders, 
it will be necessary that the galley-men should receive orders to evacuate the town. I have the honor 
to assure your Excellency that the cavalry is in want 
of every article. It must be exercised and taught 
the service, from the Colonel to the private. Colonel Kowacz is a man of great merit, and deserves the 
charge of Master of Exercise. He is an officer worthy 
of research ; and, exclusive of a thorough knowledge 
of his abilities, I request his being employed by your Excellency. I can recommend, and assure your Excellency will never have reason to repent your confidence in him. If this proposal should be agreeable 
to your Excellency, the sooner I am informed the 
better, as he will be of infinite service to the cavalry 
this winter in quarters. 
</p><p>
I have met with an armourer, who lives at Easton. 
He undertakes to furnish me with pikes, pistols, carbines, &c. If your Excellency approves of him, the 
Quartermaster-General will take your orders on that head. 
</p><p>
There are some excellent horses in this country ; 
and; as Colonel Luterloh has received orders to press 
all horses fit for the service, he may procure a number here ; but this must not be delayed, as I am in 
formed many persons buy them for the use of the 
enemy. I am, with respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Very humble, and obedient servant,
