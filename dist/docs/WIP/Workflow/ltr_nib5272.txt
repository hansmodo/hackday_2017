My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... On the subject of printing &amp; printers I have no difficulty &amp; no reserve as you may have seen in the course 
of the enquiry. The press is the channel of communication 
between the Bank &amp; the Country, and I have no more difficulty about remunerating privately for the work done on 
account of the Bank, than I would for paying the passage of the clerks of the Bank, in a steam boat or a stage when they 
were travelling on the business of the Bank. Why should we? If the grocer at the corner wishes to apprize the Community that he has some fresh figs, he is obliged to pay the Editor 
of the Newspaper by the inch, it would not be fair therefore to let the Editor do work in every respect similar for the 
Bank, without any remuneration, while he has to pay for paper &amp; types &amp; printing. I will thank you therefore to ask 
Mr Gales to print six thousand extra copies of his paper containing <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> &amp; your report together, and send them to proper persons in proper places. . . .
