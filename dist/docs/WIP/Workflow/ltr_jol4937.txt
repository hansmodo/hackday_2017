Last night General McIntosh returned with the 
agreeable intelligence that the supply of cattle which 
he was ordered to protect was out of danger. 
</p><p>
He received the S. Carolina newspapers in ecstacy, and we had some serious conversation together upon the subject of your retiring from Congress, in which 
we determined that your presence in that assembly is more necessary now, than it would have been at any other period since the revolution. More judgment, more spirit, more firmness in the conduct of the 
political bark are required than ever. So far are we from thinking that your service may be dispensed with on account of the appointment of the other delegates from S. Carolina, that we judge it more peculiarly incumbent on you, in consequence of the choice 
of one whose great talents, from a defect of probity, render him the more dangerous to remain a guardian of the liberties of these rising Slates; and not by your 
</p><p>
absence to strengthen the party of men who make their individual selves the centre of the universe. 
</p><p>
I conjure you, my dearest friend and father, in the 
name of your country, not to leave the fate of this 
empire, this last asylum of liberty, at their disposal. 
Every one of your letters, in which you so pathetically 
describe the low ebb of patriotism, furnishes me with 
irrefutable arguments. 
</p><p>
You do not particularly mention your reasons for 
quitting the Congress at this time. Impaired health, 
diminution of property and other reasons which have 
their weight might be urged, but what can be put in 
competition with the object of your present labours. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that Congress is about to reward 
Captain Lee of the dragoons for his distinguished 
services. His brilliant actions have been so frequent, 
that I think their decision need not be preceded by 
much deliberation. 
</p><p>
Nothing but his own modesty has prevented his 
being recommended to the notice of Congress long 
since. This officer only wants a larger sphere of 
action to show the extent of his military talents, and 
it will be for the benefit of the service, as well as a 
piece of justice to entrust him with a larger command, 
and honour him with a higher rank. The presence of 
disinterested patriots is wanted, if it were only to 
patronize real merit, and oppose the sudden rise of 
persons who have nothing but connections and family 
interest to recommend them. 
From some accounts lately received, it appears that 
Gen'l Howe is concentrating his forces. Such of his 
transports as are at sea will be much exposed to the 
dangers of a lee-shore, by the storm of eastern wind 
which seems to increase every moment. The advantage which he will have over us, if his transports are 
safe, and have tolerable passages will be, a power 
of taking the field earlier than we can. If he would 
do us the favour of attacking us in the position we are 
now fortifying, we might safely allow him a superiority of numbers. But we must have our tents early, 
for in case of attack, we must sacrifice our huts. 
</p><p>
This goes under the care of Brigadier Gen'l Woodford, who is proceeding to Virginia on public and private business. 
</p><p>
With the tenderest affection, your dutiful son.
