DEAR GENERAL,
</p><p>
In my last I had the honor to inform you of my 
being in possession of the enemy's works on the 
north part of Rhode Island, and of the arrival of the 
British fleet the moment we had landed; as also of 
the sailing of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> in quest of them. As 
this unfortunate circumstance deprived us of the assistance we promised ourselves from the French troops, 
I waited on the ground till the 10th, at night, when, 
finding my numbers had increased sufficiently to warrant my advancing to the town, without waiting the 
return of the fleet, I issued orders for the army to 
march the 11th, at six in the morning. But fortune, 
still determined to sport longer with us, brought on a storm so violent that it last night blew down and 
almost ruined all the tents I had. The arms, of 
course, were rendered useless, and almost the whole 
of our ammunition ruined. The much greater part 
of the army have no kind of coverings, nor would 
tents, if they had them, prove a sufficient security 
against the severity of the storm. My men are 
mostly lying under the fens, half covered with 
water, without ammunition, and with arms rendered 
useless. 
</p><p>
The communications between us and the main are 
cut off by the violence of the wind, which will scarcely permit a whaleboat to pass. Should the enemy 
come out to attack us, our dependence must be upon 
the superiority of our numbers and the point of the 
bayonet. How our militia may behave on such an 
occasion, I am unable to determine. To retreat is 
impossible; therefore we must conquer or perish. 
Perhaps, under such circumstances, an attack upon 
us might be of great advantage. Several men have 
perished from the severity of the weather, and I expect more will, as I see no probability of the storm 
ceasing. All our hopes of assistance from the French 
fleet are at an end, as this storm must have driven 
them far off from tin's post, and, I am very apprehensive, quite off the coast. To combat all these mis 
fortunes, and to surmount all these difficulties, require's a degree of temper and persevering fortitude, which I 
can never boast of, and which few possess in so ample a manner as your Excellency. I will, however, 
endeavour, by emulating the example, to rise superior 
to the malevolence of fortune and my present lament 
able situation, as quick as possible; and, if Heaven 
will cease to frown, endeavour to gratify your Excellency's desires. I am sorry your Excellency's letter, respecting the enemy's burning their shipping, 
did not arrive till they had burnt and sunk the whole 
of their vessels of war, and sunk almost all the other 
vessels, to block up the channel. 
</p><p>
The letter of your Excellency, inclosing that to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, did not arrive till after he had sailed. The intelligence from the Council of Massachusetts, informing that Admiral Byron, with thirteen 
large ships of the line, was spoken with off the Western Islands, also arrived the day after he sailed. This 
account says that Byron was spoken with on the 29th 
of June. The fleet which arrived here, and the Count 
was in pursuit of, was Lord Howe's fleet, among which 
were only five sail of the line. The rest, smaller vessels of war, and transports. They landed no men 
here. 
</p><p>
I was apprehensive that some such event as this 
might happen to deprive me of the Count's assistance. This induced me to call for more men than I 
should otherwise have done. The numbers of the 
enemy are nearly thus : 
</p><p>
Two Hessian regiments, GOO each, . . 1,200 
Two Anspach, 500 each, . . . 1,000 
Brown and Fanning, . . . . 600 
22d, 38th, 43d, and 54th British, 400 each, 1,600 
Two Hessian regiments, 500 each, . . 1,000 
Whitman's regiment, . . . . 100 
</p><p>
5,500 
To these we may add one thousand seamen, 1,000 
</p><p>
6,500 
My numbers on the Island are about nine thou 
sand, rank and file. Deserters come out in great 
numbers. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be ; my dear General, &c.,
