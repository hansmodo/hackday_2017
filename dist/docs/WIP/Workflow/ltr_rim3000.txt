DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I take the opportunity of Fulmore's return with the Oneidas, 
to acquaint you of our arrival here on the 17th, in the evening. 
Yesterday, I marched, with five hundred men, to the north side 
of <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, where we found a party of the King's troops, with 
field-pieces. This party had beaten off Major Brown f a few 
hours before, who had imprudently thrown himself in their way, 
depending on our more early arrival, which, through the dilatoriness of our young troops, could not be sooner effected. The 
enemy, after an ill-directed fire for some minutes, retired with 
precipitation ; and lucky for them they did, for had we known 
their situation, which the thickness of the woods prevented our 
finding out till it was too late, not a man of them would have 
returned. The old story of treachery spread among the men; as 
soon as we saw the enemy, we were trepanned, drawn under the 
guns of the fort, and what not. The woodsmen % were not so Expert at forming as I expected, and too many of them hung back ; 
had we kept silence at first, before we were discovered, we should 
have got a field-piece or two. 
</p><p>
I have left the five hundred men at the joining of the two 
roads ; this day I have sent them intrenching tools. 
</p><p>
Things seem to go on well among the Canadians. It is 
strongly reported, that the King's stores are embarked at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, in order to be removed. I have sent Colonel Allen to 
Chamblee, in order to raise a corps. Send me money as fast as 
possible, my dear General. Guy Johnson and Claws have represented us as beggarly miscreants, who have nothing to give away 
to the Indians, nor to pay for what we get. Fulmore will give you an account of our Council. 
</p><p>
I have great dependence on your presence, to administer to our many wants. 
</p><p>
I most earnestly hope this will find you relieved from the 
acuteness of your pain ; a perfect cure, in so short a time, can 
hardly be expected. Believe me, dear Sir, with the fullest esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. On the 17th, at night, Major Brown intercepted eight 
carts going to the fort, laden with rum and gun-carriages for the 
vessel ; these things were hid in the woods, and were not recovered by the enemy on Brown's discomfiture.
