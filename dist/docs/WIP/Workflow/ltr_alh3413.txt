SIR, 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my 
late application, and that you should think there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with it. Having renounced my expectations. I have no other inducement for 
troubling your excellency with a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent 
with the good of the service, while I was acquainted with 
the circumstances that made it so. 
</p><p>
I was too interested a spectator of what happened in the 
case of Major McPherson, not to have remarked, and not 
to recollect, all the circumstances. The opposition turned, ostensibly, on his being a brevet officer, yet having a command in a corps formed entirely from one line ; the propriety of his being employed in a detachment from the army at large, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In 
delicacy to Major McPherson, no personal objections were 
formally made, but in reality they existed and contributed 
to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar hardship, that 
a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought against us, 
and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when 
our affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should 
be preferred in one of the most honorary commands of the 
service. Your excellency must be convinced, that I mention this in no other view than to show the sentiments of 
the officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the opposition. My esteem for Major McPherson, and other reasons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 
</p><p>
I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the cases 
of Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan ; but I have understood, that it is founded on their being appointed in the light 
corps for two successive campaigns. 
</p><p>
It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge, that I 
believe a disposition to exclude brevet officers in general 
from command, has a great share in the opposition, in every 
instance, and that so far it affects my case. But, at the same 
time, it appeans to me, this principle alone can never be productive of more than momentary murmurs, where it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced, 
that the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented 
the rash steps they had taken, and, on cool reflection, were 
happy in an opportunity to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to which they were attached by habit, inclination, and interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, 
we shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless 
the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I 
am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be 
then the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your 
excellency is the best judge of the proper limits; and there 
can be no doubt, that the rights of particular officers ought 
to give place to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and 
dissimilar to all the former ; it is distinguished by the circumstances I have before intimated, my early entrance 
into the service, my having made the campaign of '76, 
the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company 
of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to a 
rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now possess, my having made all the subsequent campaigns in 
the family of the commander-in-chief, in a constant course 
of important and laborious service. These are my pretensions, at this advanced period of the war, to being employed 
in the only way which my situation admits ; and I imagine 
they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in 
general. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same light with 
your excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appointment in a light corps, should there be one formed. I entreat they may be understood in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. 
</p><p>
I assure your excellency, that I am too well persuaded of 
your candour, to attribute your refusal to any other cause 
than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the 
appointment. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your excellency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any established corps. Congress, however, seem to have made a distinction ; they give 
only a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as 
brevet officers ; mine is a regular commission.
