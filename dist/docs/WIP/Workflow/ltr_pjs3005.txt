DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here last night, and immediately received 
orders for sending you the lead (my former ones 
not having- come to hand). It will leave Crown 
Point this afternoon, and be forwarded without loss 
of time to you. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> leaves Crown Point to-day, 
with twelve hundred men and four twelve-pounders. 
I follow him this evening, and have ordered the 
whole strength I can spare to join me at Isle aux Noix without delay. When they arrive there, which 
I hope will be in five days, I shall then be near 
two thousand strong. I am still of opinion that the 
Canadians and Indians will be friendly to us, unless 
[for] the imprudence of a Captain Baker, who, without 
my leave, went upon a scout, and, contrary to the 
most pointed and express orders, seeing some people 
in a boat that belonged to us, attempted to fire on 
them, but, his gun missing, he was instantly shot 
through the head and expired. His party consisted 
of five men, and the other of an equal number, one 
of which, an Indian, was only seen to paddle away. 
</p><p>
I will neither detain your Excellency, nor waste 
my time (which is precious) in giving you a detail 
of the many wants I labor under. I hope they will 
serve for an evening chat at some future day. 
</p><p>
You would have cause to blame me for not sending  a return of the forces under my command, but I 
cannot get one that may in the least be depended 
upon. I know the reason, but so critical is my 
situation, that I sacrifice every thing to the grand 
object. I have sent on only six ; but I have promised not to complain. Adieu, my dear General. 
I am, with the most respectful sentiments, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=pjs" rel="me">PHILIP SCHUYLER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. My situation will apologize for this utter 
scrawl. Since writing the above, I have received 
the papers, of which a copy is inclosed.
