MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
We have accounts, by way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to the 
8th of March, which inform us that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> 
had met with more resistance from the insurgents 
than we had reason to expect from former accounts ; 
that an engagement had taken place, in which several persons on both sides fell, but we do not learn 
who ; that Shays had got off into Vermont, where it 
was probable he would meet with protection. I hope 
these accounts are not well founded. Let not the 
patriots of our country be discouraged or disheartened ; although their affairs are much embarrassed, 
the country is fruitful in resources. Patience, perseverance, industry, and frugality will accomplish 
great things. Our countrymen create most of the 
misfortunes they feel, for want of a disinterested 
spirit, a confidence in each other, and a union of the 
whole. It is a great misfortune, when one State 
thwarts the measures of eleven or twelve, and thus 
injures the credit and reputation of the whole. The 
situation of our country greatly damps the pleasure 
I should feel in anticipating my return to it. You 
may well suppose that falsehoods in abundance are 
circulated here ; an attempt to publish the truth or 
contradict them, would have no other effect than 
raising a nest of hornets and wasps, and would employ the whole time of one person. An extract of 
a letter published, from Dr. Rush to Dr. Price, giving 
an account of the establishment of two or three new 
societies, drew upon the latter so much abuse and 
scurrility as would disgrace any people. The writer, 
like an envenomed toad, spit forth his poison. There 
are a set of refugees residing here, the enormity of 
whose offences forbids their ever returning again to 
America. Like Satan, they look to the heights, from 
whence they have fallen, with a malice and envy 
similar to that which the arch fiend felt, when he 
beheld the glory of the new world ; and, like him, 
they wish to destroy the happiness of its inhabitants. 
Such are Galloway, and Smith, who is gone prime 
minister to Lord Dorchester. A few days before he 
left this country, he gave it as his solid opinion, that 
he should live to see America sue to Britain for protection, and to be received again by it ; he might 
have added, it should not be his fault if they did 
not. I hope a watchful eye will be kept over Lord 
Dorchester and all his movements. This government are as much disposed to sow seeds of dissension among us as ever, and build wholly upon 
our splitting to pieces.

Adieu. Yours,
