SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to address you in a long 
letter of the 20th, which I hope will come safe to 
hand. 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday I was favored with a 
letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> (copy of which in 
closed), on the contents of which, and on the report 
of the Indian deputies, I do myself the pleasure to 
congratulate your Excellency. I have made some 
explanatory notes on <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>'s letter, 
which I conceived might be necessary for you. I 
made a short speech to the Indian deputies, gave 
them a present, and they left me in high good humor, 
and with a very good opinion of our army. 
</p><p>
The vexation of spirit under which I labor, that a 
barbarous complication of disorders should prevent me 
from reaping those laurels for which I have unweariedly wrought, since I was honored with this command ; the anxiety I have suffered since my arrival 
here, lest the army should starve, occasioned by a 
scandalous want of subordination and inattention to 
my orders, in some of the officers that I left to command at the different posts ; the vast variety of 
disagreeable and vexatious incidents, that almost every 
hour arise in some department or other, not only 
retard my cure, but have put me considerably back 
for some days past. If Job had been a General in 
my situation, his memory had not been so famous for 
patience. But the glorious end we have in view, 
and which I have confident hope will be attained, 
will atone for all. 
</p><p>
I have discharged, or ordered to be discharged, 
every man that was so ill as to be rendered unfit for 
further service during this campaign, and that was 
able to return to the place of his abode. Those that 
were not, I have sent to the hospital. The former 
already amount to seven hundred and twenty-six, as 
per the inclosed return. 
</p><p>
My best wishes attend your Excellency and the 
gentlemen with you. I am, dear Sir, with the most 
sincere esteem, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
