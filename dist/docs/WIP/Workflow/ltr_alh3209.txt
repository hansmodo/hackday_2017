DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your letter of the 14th, and shall 
not fail, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>, to 
attend to the military object of it. I am much obliged to your Excellency for the communication of your southern advis. The enemy are still in the dark 
about their fleet and army gone that way, as we gather from the Commissioners. They pretend to 
have little European news, though a vessel arrived 
two or three days since from England, after ten 
weeks passage. We send you some late <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
papers. The Commission has been several days at an 
end. The enemy, as was supposed, had no idea of 
treating on national ground. We are now in private 
conversation, and so far not without hopes that the 
liberation of our prisoners will be effected on admissible terms. Two or three days more will probably put 
an end to the interview. <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> and Colonel Carrington beg their respects may be presented 
to your Excellency. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully and affectionately, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
