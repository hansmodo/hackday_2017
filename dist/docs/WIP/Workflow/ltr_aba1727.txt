</p><p>
COLONEL WARREN returned last week to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=plymouth" rel="city">Plymouth</a>, so that I shall not hear any thing from you, until he 
goes back again, which will not be till the last of this month. He damped my spirits greatly by telling me, that the Court had prolonged your stay 
another month. I was pleasing myself with the thought, that you would soon be upon your return. It is in vain to repine. I hope the public will reap what I sacrifice. 
</p><p>
I wish I knew what mighty things were fabricating. If a form of government is to be established 
here, what one will be assumed? Will it be left to our Assemblies to choose one? And will not many 
men have many minds? And shall we not run into dissensions among ourselves? 
</p><p>
I am more and more convinced, that man is a dangerous creature ; and that power, whether vested 
in many or a few, is ever grasping, and, like the grave, cries " Give, give." The great fish swallow 
up the small ; and he, who is most strenuous for the rights of the people, when vested with power is as 
eager after the prerogatives of government. You tell me of degrees of perfection to which human 
nature is capable of arriving, and I believe it, but, at the same time, lament that our admiration should 
arise from the scarcity of the instances. 
</p><p>
The building up a great empire, which was only hinted at by my correspondent, may now, I suppose, 
be realized even by the unbelievers. Yet, will not ten thousand difficulties arise in the formation of it? 
The reins of government have been so long slackened, that I fear the people will not quietly submit 
to those restraints, which are necessary for the peace and security of the community. If we separate 
from Britain, what code of laws will be established? - How shall we be governed, so as to retain our liberties? Can any government be free, which is not 
administered by general stated laws? Who shall frame these laws? Who will give them force and 
energy? It is true, your resolutions, as a body, have hitherto had the force of laws ; but will they continue to have? 
</p><p>
When I consider these things, and the prejudices of people in favor of ancient customs and regulations, I feel anxious for the fate of our monarchy or 
democracy, or whatever is to take place. I soon get lost in a labyrinth of perplexities ; but, whatever 
occurs, may justice and righteousness be the stability of our times, and order arise out of confusion. Great 
difficulties may be surmounted by patience and per severance. 
</p><p>
I believe, I have tired you with politics ; as to news we have not any at all. I shudder at the 
approach of winter, when I think I am to remain desolate. 
</p><p>
I must bid you good night ; t'is late for me, who am much of an invalid. I was disappointed last 
week in receiving a packet by the post, and, upon unsealing it, finding only four newspapers. I think 
you are more cautious than you need be. All letters, I believe, have come safe to hand. I have 
sixteen from you, and wish I had as many more. 
</p><p>
Adieu, yours.
