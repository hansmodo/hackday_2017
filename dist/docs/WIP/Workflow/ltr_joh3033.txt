SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my departure from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your favors to the 23d 
instant. I met the Congress on Saturday last, at 
Lancaster, and, upon consultation, it was judged most 
prudent to adjourn to this place, where we now are, 
and where we can prosecute business without interruption, and where your despatches will meet us. 
</p><p>
I have just now received, by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>'s 
Aid-de-camp, <a href='/results.php?tla=rot' rel='colleague'>Major Troup</a>, sundry letters, copies of 
which I have the honor to inclose to you, by which 
it appears that our affairs in the Northern Department wear a favorable aspect, and I hope soon to 
transmit you an account of an issue to the contest 
in that quarter. 
</p><p>
I wish soon to receive the most pleasing accounts 
from you. We are in daily expectation of agreeable 
tidings, and that General Howe is totally reduced. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to refer you to the inclosed papers; 
and am, with the utmost respect and esteem, Sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
