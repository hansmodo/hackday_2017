Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Nine States are not yet represented in Congress, and 
therefore the affairs of this department continue in the 
same state that they were in at the date of my last. 
</p><p>
The public papers will enable you to see the complexion 
of the times. Federal opinions grow, but it will be some time 
befure they will bear fruit; and, what is not the case with 
most other fruits, they will, to judge from present appearances, ripen slower in the south than in the north. 
</p><p>
The packet will sail next week. I shall then write to 
you ao'ain. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, I have the 
honour to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
