SIR : 
</p><p>
An application so late as this will not, I hope, be 
deemed to arise from a want of respect, or be productive of any disadvantage to me ; nor an address in writing 
thought less decent than a personal one. The latter I have 
sometimes supposed most proper, but several reasons determined me to make the former. In that way I can deliver 
my sentiments more clearly; and (if they merit consideration) they may be considered more calmly and deliberately. 
Besides, the request may be granted or denied with more 
ease both to the petitioner and the judge ; for to a benevolent mind it must give pain to refuse even what ought to be 
refused; and a man of liberal and generous sentiments 
would choose rather that his justice or his bounty should be 
manifested in his actions, than in the warmest professions 
of favor or friendship. 
</p><p>
You must, Sir, ere now apprehend the design of this 
letter, if you have never heard that I am desirous of being 
appointed joint Clerk with Mr. Bowditch. This, I find, 
would be agreeable to him, and, if I had his leave, would 
urge it as an argument in my favor. I am sensible, Sir, 
there are other candidates for the office, who have doubtless 
severally importuned your favor in their behalf. But permit me, Sir, to say, that I know but one case in which favor 
can properly take place : that is, where there are two or 
more candidates of exactly similar pretensions, whose qualifications and circumstances are in nothing different. In any 
other case, to ask the office as a matter of favor I should 
think was paying but an ill compliment to the person 
requested to grant it ; for it must impeach either his 
understanding or his justice. The power of conferring this 
office, I take it, is vested in the Judges, not to give them 
an opportunity of gratifying a friend or favorite, but that 
they should place it in such hands as are most likely to do 
the public the best service, by an exact and diligent performance of the duties of it. 
</p><p>
Can you forgive this freedom, Sir? I own it is a style 
unusual from the mouth of a petitioner. But should I 
address an honest man of delicate sentiments with fawning 
adulation and servile importunity ? Or should I be thought 
vain, were I to confess myself incapable of using such contemptible means of supplying my wants? Good Sir, after 
your voluntary, disinterested interposition in my favor in 
a military concern, (for which I sincerely honor and thank 
you,) I should esteem it a gross affront with servile sub 
mission to sue to you for the office as a matter of favor, 
except in the case before mentioned. Here, therefore, both 
for your honor and my own, I choose to rest the matter; 
and with your determination, be it for or against me, I shall 
remain satisfied. I request the office merely to procure me 
a living, not to add to thousands already in possession. In 
my present situation, I must own, I have enough ; but 
without more I shall for ever be excluded from the dearest 
connection in life. Excuse, I pray you, this liberty; and 
believe me to be, with sincere respect, your most obedient 
</p><p>
servant. 
</p><p>
TIMOTHY PICKERING, JUN.
