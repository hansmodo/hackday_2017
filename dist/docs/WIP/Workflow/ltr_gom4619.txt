Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Heretofore I have mentioned to you, that I had not been 
able to adjust with the minister of Foreign Affairs the rate of 
exchange, which should govern the payments made, and mak 
ing, in America, on account of our debt to France ; and that 
I had not been able to see the minister of Marine, to adjust 
with him the sums which the Assembly had determined to 
apply out of that debt to the use of St Domingo. You will 
have seen, by my correspondence with the Commissioners of 
the Treasury, that the last payment of six millions will nearly 
balance the account according even to their statement of it, 
over and above the four hundred thousand dollars, which are 
to be paid at Philadelphia during the current year. 
</p><p>
A few days since M. Monge, the present minister of the 
Marine, desired an interview, and at our meeting he presented 
me a regular contract for payment of eight hundred thousand 
dollars, as being equivalent to the four million of livres, which 
the Assembly had appropriated as above mentioned. I will 
not trouble you with the conversation, because it ended in a 
request on his part to meet <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a> the minister of Foreign 
Affairs, and M. Claviere the minister of Public Contributions. 
This meeting took place yesterday by their appointment. 
The same form of agreement was again produced, and M. 
Claviere, who was principal spokesman, mentioned my signing 
it as a thing of course. I told him that I had been authorised 
to settle with the late government the exchange of one half of 
that sum already paid, and paying, on this very account. 
He spoke of such settlement as the easiest thing in the world, 
and advanced on the subject exactly those principles, which 
Mr Short had refused to be governed by ; and rejected as 
visionary those, which Mr Short had stated as just, and which 
I think are reasonable and right. 
</p><p>
The great object however was to get the money, and Congress was to fix the exchange. I told them, (which is very 
true) that I felt a sincere desire to furnish aid to that unhappy 
colony, and had done everything in my power to comply with 
the wish of the legislature in that respect, but in vain ; that 
at last our bankers in Holland being extremely anxious to discharge themselves of the large sums which had for months 
been lying in their hands, their own Commissaries of the Treasury being also desirous to receive it, Mr Short, to whom the 
management of that business had been committed by the 
United States, being also solicitous that the payments should 
be made, I had desired him to place in the hands of the 
bankers named by the Commissaries an equivalent of six mil 
lions of livres, by which means the instalments of our debt already due, were overpaid. That of course any advances now made must be on account of those instalments, which 
are to become due hereafter. That I had no instructions 
respecting them, for reasons I had already assigned, and that 
of consequence, if I should enter into the agreement they 
wished, I should probably be blamed for exceeding the line 
prescribed to me. That there remained, however, another 
point worthy of their attention, which was that my agreement 
would be in itself void, because I had no powers to treat with 
the present government. It followed, therefore, that the ministers of the United States would feel themselves as much at 
liberty, as if nothing had been done, and act according to their 
own ideas of the object, distinctly from any engagements. 
That it would be equally useful to them,, and more proper in 
me, to state the whole matter to you in the first instance, and 
that I would add my earnest request to make the desired payment. 
</p><p>
This however did not at all suit their ideas. M. Claviere 
made many observations on the nature of our debt, and the 
manner in which it had accrued. He said that the United 
States would certainly act in a different manner towards the 
present Government, from what the Monarchs of Europe did. 
That it was impossible I should have any difficulty, if I inclined to do what they asked, and then concluded by asking me 
peremptorily whether I would, or would not. 
</p><p>
His language and manner were such as naturally to excite 
some little indignation, and although I would pardon much in 
a man, whose stockjobbing life had but little qualified him for a 
station in which delicacy of manner and expression is almost 
essential, yet I could not submit to an indignity in my per 
son, towards the country I represent. I told him therefore that 
I did not understand what he meant to say. My countenance 
I believe spoke the rest of my sentiments, and led him to say, 
in explanation, that it was necessary for them to have some 
positive engagement, because otherwise they must make pro 
vision for the service from another source, and then he again expressed his conviction, that the United States would recognise them ; and at any rate would not disavow the engagements which I might make. I told him it was not proper for 
me, a servant, to pretend to decide on what would be the 
opinion of my masters. That I should wait their orders, and 
obey them when received. That the present Government 
might collect my sentiments from my conduct. That I could 
not possibly take on me to judge questions of such magnitude. 
That I would do everything I could with propriety, and again 
repeated my offer, which they would not listen to, and I left 
them, not a little displeased, if I may judge from appearances 
by no means equivocal. 
</p><p>
The Dutch Ambassador, who dined with me, told me that 
he had received his orders, and should ask for passports this 
day. The British Ambassador went off two days ago, and 
Mr Lindsay, their Minister, intends going tomorrow. He offers to take my letters to Mr Pinckney, to whom I shall en 
close this to be forwarded to you. 
</p><p>
Last evening between ten and eleven, I received a visit 
from some Commissaires de Section, who came in consequence 
of a denunciation made by some blockhead, or rascal, that I 
had arms concealed in my house. I made them sensible of 
the impropriety of their conduct, told them that I had no arms, 
and that if I had, they should not touch one of them. That 
in such case, they must apply to me through their minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and ask me to cede them. I insisted that the 
man who had presumed to make this denunciation should be 
seized, and then I would demonstrate the falsehood, that he 
might be punished. The scene finished by apologies on their 
part. Last night there was a general visit and search through 
out the town for arms and I presume for persons also. It still 
continues. Between nine and ten, the Commissary called on 
me with many apologies, and took a note of my reply, so that 
we met and parted good friends. 
</p><p>
You will see by all this, my dear Sir, that I have sufficient 
cause to take offence and depart, if I were so inclined ; but I 
will stay, if possible, so as to preserve to you the most perfect 
liberty of action. I do not indeed feel offended at what is 
done by the people, because they cannot be supposed to understand the law of nations, and because they are in a state of 
fury which is inconceivable, and which leaves them liable to all 
impressions, and renders them capable of all excesses. I 
shall endeavor, nevertheless, to preserve the proper firmness, 
and let what will happen^ I hope that though my friends should 
have occasion to lament my fate, they will never be obliged to 
blush for my conduct.
