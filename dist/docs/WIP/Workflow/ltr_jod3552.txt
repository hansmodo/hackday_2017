MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE legion of Lauzun has arrived, and we hope 
has brought the orders of Congress for us, but we 
have not yet received them, and are as much at a 
loss as ever. I know not whether my resignation is 
accepted, and consequently can give you no conjecture 
when I shall be able to get away. As the spring and 
summer passage is lost, I cannot now embark before 
September, or October, or November. Whether I 
shall embark from France, Holland, or England, I 
don t know. It will be according as I hear of a convenient passage. Write me by all these ways. I 
have received no line from you dated since December. 
</p><p>
The definitive treaty may be signed in three weeks, 
and it may as probably be trained on till Christmas. In 
the last case, provided the acceptance of my resignation should not arrive, it may be spring before I can 
embark. In this state of suspense and perplexity 
you may well suppose I do not sleep upon a bed of 
roses, especially as the public affairs are as uncertain 
as our private ones. I should like very well to take 
a short tour to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> before my return, for the sake 
of taking a look at that country, and seeing some personages there, because if I waive this opportunity it 
is not likely I shall ever have another. Once more 
at home, it is not probable I shall again go abroad. 
Indeed, it is more for the sake of Mr. John than for 
my own that I wish to see England at all. 
</p><p>
I was at Versailles the day before yesterday, and 
paid my respects to the King arid Queen, Monsieur 
and Madame his lady, the Comte d Artois, Madame 
Elizabeth, and the Mesdames of France, Adelaide 
and Victoire. As the weather was more like a spring 
equinox than a summer solstice, the number of ambassadors was smaller than usual, and the attendant 
crowd less, so that I had a better opportunity of viewing the royal family at leisure than I ever had before. 
</p><p>
I dined and breakfasted, indeed, with the ambassadors, and found them um versally more sociable than 
ever they were before. They begin now universally to consider and treat us as members of their body. 
</p><p>
It is forbidden, I suppose, to princes and princesses 
upon these occasions to utter a sentiment, lest they 
should betray a secret of state, or say something 
which might lead a sagacious ambassador to political 
consequences. Accordingly no one word is ever said, 
except asking a question about some common thing, 
as the weather, the " spectacles," or, have you 
come from Paris to-day ? I know an ambassador 
who has been fourteen years at a court, who has 
attended regularly once a week, who says that a 
prince has never failed to ask him the same question 
every time "Did you come from home to-day ?" 
and never any other. This ambassador, too, is of the 
highest rank. Among all the officers who come in 
play upon these occasions, such as introducers of ambassadors, secretary of the presentations of ambassadors, &c., there ought, I think, to be one preceptor to 
teach the princes and princesses the art of asking 
questions and making observations upon these occasions. 
</p><p>
The Prince of Orange's court is a miniature of that of 
Versailles. The ceremonials and the conversation of 
princes and princesses is much the same. The English gentlemen here, particularly Mr. Hartley, tells 
me I must be presented at court, if I should go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> only for a visit, in my public character as a 
minister at the peace. This is rather a discouraging 
circumstance, as I should wish to go incog, as much 
as possible, and my appearance at court would make 
more talk than I wish. I should be stared at as a 
sight. I should be treated, however, complaisantly 
enough, I doubt not. The case is altered. I had 
rather make my court to my princesses at Penn's hill 
than to all the others in the world. This honor I 
hope for, but cannot promise myself so soon as I 
wish.
