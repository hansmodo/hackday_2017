Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have written a short letter this day, in answer to your 
despatches. Herewith I do myself the honor to transmit the 
copy of what I wrote on the 22d of last month. The 
exchange has been sustained as there mentioned. 
</p><p>
On the eighth of last month, I desired Mr Jones (with 
whom Mr Fenwick had entrusted his consular affairs during a 
voyage he made to England) to give you his opinion respecting the situation and temper of Bourdeaux, with the reasons 
therefor. The gazettes will have shown you, that apprehen 
sions were entertained respecting the dispositions of people in 
that quarter. I believe that there is still cause to apprehend, 
more especially as the insurrection in the Vendee is more 
menacing than ever. 
</p><p>
The conduct of the Convention respecting our treaty, will 
have formed a useful reinforcement to those, who would pre 
serve our Constitution. My efforts to support the treaty have 
been constant and persevering, although, in my private judgment, the breach of it on the part of our allies, by releasing us 
from the obligations it has imposed, could not but be useful 
under the present circumstances. 
</p><p>
I am very anxious that Consuls and Vice Consuls should be 
appointed in all the ports. My countrymen are incessantly 
applying to me from every quarter about property taken 
from them. I am desired from abroad to claim such property. 
The courts chicane very much here, under the pretence that 
claimants do not produce proper authority from the owners, fee. 
I have decidedly refused to lend my name on such occasions, 
because I am certain that I should be thereupon represented as 
a party interested, and, of course, my representations against 
the iniquitous proceedings, which are but too frequent, would 
be disregarded. It happens also that I am called upon to 
name proper agents in the ports where there is no Consul. In 
such cases, I must take the recommendation of a banker, and 
incur the risk of placing a person, interested in a capture, as 
protector of the property taken. 
</p><p>
The state of public affairs here involves me in another 
very disagreeable predicament. My fellow citizens are aggrieved and apply for redress, to which they are justly entitled, and which they are led to expect with the greater certainty, as every public act breathes warm attachment to the 
United States. On the other hand, it is frequently impossible to obtain redress, because the government, omnipotent in 
some cases, is, in others, not merely feeble, but enslaved. I 
am forced to see that my demands must embarrass and frequently irritate them. The ministers, who ought to be 
accountable agents of public authority, are placed in such 
direct subordination to the Comite de Salut Public, that even 
the common routine must await their fiat, and they are unaccountable, and swayed by the terror of an insurrection, which 
may be excited at any moment, should they displease the leaders of this city. Consequently, while they see and 
lament the consequences of many acts, they are obliged to commit them. 
</p><p>
A knowledge of this reduces me to the necessity of choosing between national and particular interests. In preferring 
the former, the latter become clamorous, and I am sure that 
I shall be represented as an idle and unprofitable servant. 
To this inevitable evil I must submit. But another has 
arisen out of it, which gives me concern. In assigning to 
complainants the reasons why their expectations must be disappointed, I have been obliged to state things, which, being 
repeated and misrepresented, have produced a disagreeable 
effect in the minds of those, who are to decide on the applications I make. 
</p><p>
This will appear more clearly from an example. On the 
twentieth of August a deputation of four ship captains, chosen 
by their brethren of Bordeaux, called upon me with a representation of the injustice they experienced in being prevented from sailing with their cargoes, &c. Their suffering was 
occasioned by one of those decrees, which, being commanded 
by the popular cry in a time of violence, the legislature, 
though it may perceive the impolicy, dares not repeal. The 
deputation, as is natural, had flattered themselves with immediate and ample redress. It was my duty to moderate their 
expectations, and to explain the difficulties. Interest is often 
blind and seldom just. My moderation was ill suited to their 
wishes, and my letter to the minister, of which a copy is en 
closed, seemed to them rather an abandonment of their cause, 
than the prosecution of the only redress which appeared to 
me attainable, and in the only way by which it might be 
effected. I had cautioned them particularly not to ask too 
much, because they would thereby run the risk of not obtaining what they asked, or, if they should obtain ft, of seeing 
their hopes blasted in the bud, by a repeal of an indulgent 
decree. 
</p><p>
What had passed respecting the article of our treaty, favor 
able to the navigation of neutral vessels, was an instance so 
clear of the influence which prevails in the Convention over 
the principles of policy, as well as of justice, that, while it 
gufded my advice, it ought to have swayed their conduct. In 
closed you have a copy of their memorial to the Convention. 
I have not thought it worth while to inquire by whom it was 
written. The style shows it to be from a French hand. I 
learn that a favorable reception was secured by repeating 
such parts of my conversation, as might at once irritate the 
members of the Comite de Saint Public, and justify the personal application of American citizens while their Minister 
was on the spot. A decree was obtained, and before it 
could be executed was repealed. 
</p><p>
Thus it has happened, that they did mischief, without any 
benefit to themselves, and only served an ambition so contemptible, that I shall draw over it the veil of oblivion. The 
important facts of this matter came to my knowledge in the 
close of the last month, and, therefore, in mine of the first 
instant to M. Deforgues, of which a copy is enclosed, I took 
occasion to meet the mischief without going out of my way 
to seek it. This was the situation of things, when I received your important despatches. I need not comment upon it, 
because you will naturally place yourself in my situation and 
feel its unpleasantness. 
</p><p>
I will not now give you anything in the style of news, deferring that until the moment when Captain Culver shall be 
about to depart. In the mean time, I pray you to accept the 
assurances of that esteem and respect, with which I have the 
honor to be, &c.
