My dear General, 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for honoring my bill in favor of <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague'>General Lincoln</a>. It includes the whole sum 
expended, on your account, in France. The plan, 
which brought me to this country, was urged with 
all the zeal which the subject inspired, both in our 
Privy Council and Assembly ; but the single voice 
of reason was drowned by the bowlings of a triple-headed monster, in which prejudice, avarice, and pusillanimity were united. It was some degree of consolation to me, however, to perceive that truth and 
philosophy had gained some ground ; the suffrages in 
favor of the measure being twice as numerous as on 
a former occasion. Some hopes have been lately 
given me from Georgia; but I fear, when the question is put, we shall be outvoted there with as much 
disparity as we have been in this country. 
</p><p>
The reports of the prompt evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> 
I always thought groundless, and should have much 
sooner inferred the probability of such an event from 
the language of the debates in the British Parliament than from the conduct and arrangements of 
General Leslie. The late disaster of the Count de Grasse, in the West Indies, makes me more incredulous on the subject than ever. General Leslie confines himself to the most circumspect defensive conduct, which he is not likely to change, as he recently 
detached the nineteenth and thirtieth regiments to 
Jamaica. This renders the campaign perfectly inactive here, and, above all, insipid to the light troops, 
which I at present command. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency has not yet determined 
your plan for the ensuing campaign, and that it must 
depend on the cooperation of our allies. I earnestly 
desire to be where any active plans are likely to be 
executed, and to be near your Excellency on all occasions in which my services can be acceptable. The 
pursuit of an object which, I confess, is a favorite 
one with me, because I always regarded the interests 
of this country and those of the Union as intimately 
connected with it, has detached me more than once 
from your family; but those sentiments of veneration 
and attachment with which your Excellency has inspired me, keep me always near you, with the sincerest and most zealous wishes for a continuance of 
your happiness and glory. Give me leave to say 
that I am ever, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's faithful Aid, 
</p><p>
