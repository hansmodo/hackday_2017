Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr- Carter lately delivered to me your friendly letter of 
the 25th of July last. You was always of the number of 
those whom I esteemed, and your correspondence would 
have been both interesting and agreeable. I had heard of 
your marriage, and it gave me pleasure, as well because it 
added to your happiness, as because it tended to fix your 
residence in a State, of which I long wished you to be, and 
remain a citizen. 
</p><p>
The character and talents of delegates to Congress daily 
become more and more important, and I regret your declining that appointment at this interesting period. Respect, 
however, is due to the considerations which influence you; 
but as they do not oppose your accepting a place in the 
Legislature, I hope the public will still continue to derive 
advantage from your services. Much remains to be done, 
and labourers do not abound. 
</p><p>
I am happy to hear that the terms of peace, and the conduct of your negotiators, give general satisfaction ; but 
there are some of our countrymen, it seems, who are not 
content, and that too with an article which I thought to be 
very unexceptionable, viz. the one ascertaining our boundaries. Perhaps those gentlemen are latitudinarians. 
</p><p>
The American newspapers, for some months past, contain 
advices that do us harm. Violences, and associations 
against the tories, pay an ill compliment to government, 
and impeach our good faith in the opinions of some, and our 
magnanimity in the opinions of many. Our reputation 
also suffers from the apparent reluctance to taxes, and the 
ease with winch we incur debts without providing for their 
payment. The complaints of the army — the jealousies 
respecting Congress — the circumstances which induced 
their leaving <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> — and the too little appearance of 
a national spirit, pervading, uniting, and invigorating the 
confederacy, are considered as omens which portend the 
diminution of our respectability, power, and felicity. I 
hope that, as the wheel turns round, other and better indications will soon appear. I am persuaded that America 
possesses too much wisdom and virtue to permit her brilliant 
prospects to fade away for the want of either. But, whatever time may produce, certain it is, that our reputation 
and our affairs suffer from present appearances. 
</p><p>
The tories are as much pitied in these countries as they 
are execrated in ours. An undue degree of severity 
towards them would, therefore, be impolitic as well as 
unjustifiable. They who incline to involve that whole class 
of men in indiscriminate punishment and ruin, certainly 
carry the matter too far. It would be an instance of unnecessary rigour, and unmanly revenge, without a parallel, 
except in the annals of religious rage, in times of bigotry 
and blindness. What does it signify where nine-tenths of 
these people are buried ? I would rather see the sweat of 
their brows fertilizing our fields than those of our nei^hbours, in which it would certainly water those seeds of 
hatred, which, if so cultivated, may produce a hedge of 
thorns against us. Shall all be pardoned then? By no 
means. Banish and confiscate the estates' of such of 
them as have been either faithless or cruel, and forgive 
the rest. 
</p><p>
Victory and peace should, in my opinion, be followed by 
clemency, moderation, and benevolence, and we should be 
careful not to sully the glory of the revolution by licentiousness and cruelty. These are my sentiments, and however 
unpopular they may be, I have not the least desire to conceal or disguise them. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best compliments to Mrs. 
Hamilton, and believe me to be, 
</p><p>
With great esteem and regard, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
