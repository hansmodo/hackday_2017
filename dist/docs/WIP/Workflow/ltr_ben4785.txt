LOVING COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of the 23d of March. I was 
happy to find that neither you, nor any of your family, were 
in the way of those murderers. 2 I hope that before this time 
the town is quite freed from such dangerous and mischievous 
inmates. 
</p><p>
I rejoice to hear that you and your good wife and children 
continue in health. My love to them. I still enjoy a considerable share of that blessing, thanks to God, and hope 
once more to see <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and my friends there before I die. 
I left it first in <a href='/results.php?year=1723'>1723</a>. I made a visit there in <a href='/results.php?year=1733'>1733</a>; another 
in <a href='/results.php?year=1743'>1743</a>; another in <a href='/results.php?year=1753'>1753</a>; another in <a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a>. Perhaps if I 
live to <a href='/results.php?year=1773'>1773</a>, I may then call again and take my leave. 
</p><p>
Our relation, Sally Franklin, 3 is still with me here, is a 
very good girl, and grown up almost a woman. She sends 
her love to you and yours. I am, with sincere regard, your 
affectionate cousin, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p>
