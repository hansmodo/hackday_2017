My dear old Friend, I received your kind letter of 
May 10. I am glad the Rhubarb Seed got safe to hand. I 
make no doubt of its Thriving well in our Country, where the 
Climate is the same with that of the Chinese Wall, just outside which it grows in plenty and of the best Quality. I shall 
be glad to know how you find the Juniper. I asked Solander 
about the Lucern Seed you wrote for. He could give me no 
Account of it, nor can I learn anything of it from others. 
You may rely upon my Friendship in recommending your 
Seeds. I send all that enquire of me about American Seeds 
to Mr. Freeman. He should advertise them when they come. 
</p><p>
I hear nothing lately of Young, and think him not of much 
Consequence. With Love to Mrs. Bartram and your Children, I am ever, my dear Friend, yours most Affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
