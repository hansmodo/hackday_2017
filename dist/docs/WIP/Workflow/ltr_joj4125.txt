Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The negotiation is terminated by a treaty. It will, with 
this letter, go by the packet, which, in expectation of this 
event, has been detained above a week. 
</p><p>
In my opinion we have reason to be satisfied. It is 
expedient that the ratification should not be unnecessarily 
delayed. The best disposition towards us prevails in the 
cabinet, and I hope they will have reason to be content 
with the delicacy and propriety of our conduct towards 
them and the nation. Further concessions on the part of 
Great Britain cannot, in my opinion, be attained. The minister flatters himself that this treaty will be very acceptable to our country, and that some of the articles in it will 
be received as unequivocal proofs of good-will. We have 
industriously united our efforts to remove difficulties, and 
few men would have persevered in such a dry, perplexing 
business, with so much patience and temper as he has 
done. 
</p><p>
I could write you a long letter on these topics, but I 
have not time. Believe me to be, with great esteem and 
regard, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
