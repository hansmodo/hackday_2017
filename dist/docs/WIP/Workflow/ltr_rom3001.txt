SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received your favor of this day, and 
sent to <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> to detain the express until 
I collect the hard money you want, which you may 
depend shall be sent, in one specie or other, with this 
letter, and a list thereof shall be inclosed herein. 
</p><p>
I had long since parted with very considerable 
sums of hard money to Congress; therefore must collect from others, and, as matters now stand, it is no 
easy matter. I mean to borrow silver, and promise 
payment in gold, and will then collect the gold in 
the best manner I can. Whilst on this subject, let 
me inform you that there are upwards of twenty 
thousand dollars in silver at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. They have 
no particular use for it, and I think you might as 
well send a party to bring it away, and lodge it in 
a safe place convenient for any purposes for which 
it may hereafter be wanted. 
</p><p>
I gave Mr. Commissary Wharton an order for forty 
thousand dollars this morning, and pressed him to at 
tend most diligently to your supplies. I will send 
for him again, know what is done, and add springs 
to his movements, if I can. I wish he was more 
silent, prudent, &c. : but I fancy he is active. What 
ever I can do shall be done for the good of the service. I ever am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=rom" rel="me">ROBERT MORRIS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Hearing that you are in want of a quarter cask of wine, I have procured a good one, which Mr. Commissary Wharton will send up.
