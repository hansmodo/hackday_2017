Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Among other letters brought by Major Franks, I had the 
pleasure of receiving one from you, dated in July last. 
From the few of mine that have reached you, it appears 
they have been very unfortunate, and with many others, 
have probably perished in the ocean. 
</p><p>
I am therefore to repeat my congratulations on the happiness you derive from the most delicate of all connexions 
with one of the most lovely of her sex. As I am always 
pleased to find those happy who I think deserve to be so, it 
gave me very sensible satisfaction to hear that you had 
both made so judicious a choice, notwithstanding the vi ii 
which that sweet fascinating passion often draws over our 
eyes and understanding. Be pleased to present my compliments and best wishes to Mrs. Bingham, and to add and 
accept those of Mrs. Jay. who never speaks of Martinico 
without expressing how much we are indebted to you for 
the agreeable manner in which we passed the time we 
staid there. 
</p><p>
Your representation of the state of our affairs is flattering, and affords reason to hope that the enemy will soon 
cease to deceive themselves and others by groundless expectations of conquest. 
</p><p>
Peace and the negotiations for it are the prevailing topics 
of conversation here, and perhaps in America also. I 
hope, however, that our countrymen will not suffer themselves to be too much influenced by prospects, which may 
prove no less delusive than they are pleasing. To prepare 
vigorously for war is the only sure way of preparing for a 
speedy and valuable peace. 
</p><p>
The Duke de Crillon is in possession of every part of 
Minorca, except Fort St. Philip, which, unless pressed by 
want of provisions or ammunition, will not, I suspect, soon 
or easilv change masters. 
</p><p>
I should mention some other public intelligence ; but 
before this letter can possibly come to your hands, as Major 
Franks will go from hence to Paris, it will cease to be new 
in America. 
</p><p>
It is natural for you to expect that my letters should now and then contain some traits of this country, its manners, government, and principal characters. With respect 
to the three first, I make it a rule to be perfectly silent in 
all my letters. The latter is a very delicate subject, and 
men should be well acquainted with a character before 
they attempt to describe it. Much injustice is often done 
by taking reports as facts, and forming opinions of men 
from the suggestions which may arise from envy or interested partialities. Though not very old, I have lived too 
long to credit all I hear ; and having been deceived by fair 
as well as unpromising appearances, they have ceased to 
decide my judgment of men. 
</p><p>
Whenever you write to me, which I hope will be often, 
recollect that your letters will, in nine instances out of ten, 
be inspected before they reach me ; write nothing, therefore, 
that you would wish concealed. But as this necessary 
caution may sometimes restrain you from communicating 
what you may think interesting for me to know, I cannot 
omit this opportunity of giving you a cipher, viz. Entick's 
New Spelling Dictionary, printed at London in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, which 
you will easily find at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; I bought mine at 
Bell's book-store. Add twenty to the number of the page, 
and ten to that of the word you use. Distinguish the first 
column by a dot over the first figure, and the second 
column by a dot over the second figure. For instance, the 
word duration is the first word in the first column of the 
139th page, and must be thus written, 159 11. Again, the 
word beauty is the tenth word in the second column of the 
60th page, and must be thus written, 80 20. But as it may 
often happen that you may want to write names or words 
which you will not find in the dictionary, use the following 
alphabet in such cases : 
</p><p>
a b c d e f g h i j k 1 m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
n m 1 k i h f i e d c b a 1 y v x t u r p w s z o y 
The design of this alphabet is obvious ; use n for a, m 
for b, &c. 
</p><p>
I must now remark that you will have it in your power 
to give me advices of such matters as, though often interesting, I am seldom favoured with by any of my correspondents. I mean the state of parties, the views of leading individuals, and such intelligence respecting our friends 
and others, as though I might wish to know, ought not to 
be public, and can only be safely communicated in cipher. 
</p><p>
Send your letters for me, under cover, to His Excellency 
the Count de Montmorin, the Ambassador of His Most 
Christian Majesty at this court. 
</p><p>
I fear you will find a correspondence of this kind a little 
troublesome, but I know your industry, talents, and disposition to oblige, and therefore, though my letters mav not 
always afford an adequate compensation, I flatter myself 
you will not decline it, especially as you may be assured of 
the utmost prudence and secrecy on my part. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to remember us to all our friends in your 
circle. With sincere regard and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
