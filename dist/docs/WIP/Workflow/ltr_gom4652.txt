Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of the letter from Dumouriez to the Convention, of the twelfth instant, which, not having been publicly 
read, he has caused to be printed in Flanders, and the enclosed 
is from Brussels. This letter, and the proclamations which 
accompanied it, form a singular contrast with the conduct pursued by that General on entering victoriously into the country, 
which I had the honor to communicate in mine of the twenty- 
first of December. It accords but badly also with a later 
transaction. He had opened a large loan, on his private credit and account, at Antwerp ; but the capitalists having no 
great confidence in him, it went on slowly ; and to stimulate 
their zeal, he threatened them with something very like military execution. 
</p><p>
Having mentioned, here, my letter of the twenty -first of 
December, I cannot avoid observing to you that the correspondence between Pache and Dumouriez, as published by the 
latter, shows that the orders given by Pache to reinforce Custine were far more extraodinary than I had conceived ; seeing 
he was directed to march in midwinter across the pathless 
mountains of the Ardennes, in which he could have found 
neither food, forage, nor shelter from the storms. Similar orders to Beurnouville had pushed him, as I therein informed 
you, on the road to Treves. No good opportunity offering, 
I did not then communicate the result of that expedition ; 
which by the bye was never made public here ; but the fact 
is, that he lost one half of his army, and those who returned 
were as fit for the hospital as for the field, almost ; so that 
the Austrian General, Beaulieu, pushed his advanced posts 
forward with impunity to the French frontier. 
</p><p>
In the enclosed letter of Dumouriez are three things worthy 
of notice. First, the great diminution of the French armies in that quarter ; secondly, the violence used to obtain 
an appearance of union with France ; and thirdly, the temper and disposition of the Flemish nation. On the first of 
these points, I refer for the force which he commanded on entering the Low Countries, to the above mentioned correspondence with Pache, mutilated as it is, and from which you will 
find that the account I had given you of his numbers was ex 
act. Between one hundred and one hundred and ten thou 
sand Frenchmen broke into the Low Countries last autumn, 
and yet what I told you on the first day of the present year, viz. 
that the effectives under Miranda and Valence, when united, did 
not exceed thirty-five thousand, is strictly true. But there 
were sundry posts and garrisons spread through the country, 
and all along to the sea coasts, making up about ten thousand 
more ; and it is true that many have come out of the hospitals, 
and many recruits have been sent on ; but some have gone in 
to the hospitals, and straggling parties have constantly returned, 
so that forty-five thousand men were about the existent force, 
previous to the efforts for the expedition to Holland, about all 
which I shall say more presently, and only observe here, that 
he states the army as being reduced by sickness, skirmishes, 
and desertion, to less than one half of their force. Such, says 
he, was our situation, when on the first of February you declared war against England and Holland. 
</p><p>
The second point, namely, the manner of obtaining three 
vote of the Belgic people for a union with France, I had mentioned to you in mine of the seventh instant, upon very full in 
formation from various quarters of that country. The account 
which Durnouriez gives, is a curious piece for history. The 
conduct, which may naturally be expected from men so abused, 
I had mentioned to you on the twenty-fifth of January, and as 
signed on the thirteenth of February the reason why they had 
not already avenged the injuries they had received. But no 
sooner did the movements towards Holland lessen the garrisons 
distributed among them, than the smothered flame began to 
break out, and the French have already paid pretty severely 
for a conduct, of which the instances in modern times are 
rare. 
</p><p>
In my last I mentioned to you that a battle appeared probable, and that it would decide the fate of the Low Countries. 
This battle took place definitively on the eighteenth, having 
been preceded by some warm skirmishes on the preceding 
days. As I mentioned on the ninth the whole force of the 
French, as not being more than from fifty to sixty thousand men, 
it may not be amiss to give here some general state of the force 
now at the disposition of the Republic. Speaking in round 
numbers, the force required was, about five hundred thousand, 
to complete which, an apportionment was made on the first instant of near three hundred thousand, viz. two hundred and 
ninety -six thousand five hundred and fifty- three, on the different departments, exclusively of the army of reserve, which we 
may suppose to consist of the paper surplus beyond five hun 
dred thousand, whatever that may be. Thus it would seem? 
that the existent force on the first instant, as borne on the re 
turns, was about two hundred thousand. 
</p><p>
This force is divided, and to be divided, into eight different 
armies, viz. that of the North, commanded by Dumouriez ; the 
Ardennes, by Valence ; the Moselle, by Beurnonville ; the 
Rhine, by Custine ; the Alps, by Kellermann ; Italy, by Biron ; 
the Pyrenees, by Servan ; and the Sea Coast, by Labourdonnaye. Deducting from the supposed existing force, for garri 
sons, sick, posts, and communications, and the numberless 
contingencies of service, eighty to ninety thousand, we have 
remaining a total of one hundred and ten thousand to one hundred and twenty thousand, in the different armies under arms. 
</p><p>
So much for a general view. I will now give a more particular one coincident therewith. The army of Dumouriez 
may be stated at ninety thousand, that of Custine fifty-four 
thousand, that of Biron at eighteen thousand, those of Valence 
and Beurnonville, each seven thousand, those of Kellermann, 
Servan and Labourdonnaye each nine thousand, making together two hundred and three thousand. But of these there are 
only the three first worth noting here, as the others are all in different posts and garrisons. And, by the way, that we may finish at once with Biron's army, (intended to be about fifty thousand strong, but avowedly defective on the first instant about 
thirty two thousand,) as it has been in a kind of small action 
for the last three months, and must keep up sundry posts in the 
county of Nice, and on the communications, the total operative force cannot exceed twelve thousand men. 
</p><p>
We shall come to Custine by and bye ; but at present we 
will return to the northern army. As this was to be exposed 
to the greatest efforts of the enemy, and as the government 
counted on success in that quarter for the means to dictate its 
own terms of peace, the force of it was to be one hundred 
and forty thousand ; but the avowed deficiency being fifty 
thousand, leaves the above number of ninety thousand, deducting therefrom twenty-five thousand for the several garrisons 
(of which there are at least a dozen) and for the sick, we have 
a remainder of sixty-five thousand, of which fifteen thousand 
were under Dumouriez in Holland. 
</p><p>
The armies, then, of Miranda and Valence did not exceed 
five thousand, and the enemy give an account of above ten 
thousand of these in the affairs of the 28th February to the 
4th March, besides what may have gone off in different directions. The army, therefore, which Dumouriez commanded at 
Louvain on the fifteenth instant, could not exceed forty thou 
sand. His loss between that and the nineteenth was at least 
twenty thousand. He cannot therefore on the twentieth have 
had more than twenty thousand left. Probably about fifteen 
thousand. From the Dutch expedition, if ever they get back, 
not more than ten thousand can ever join him, because the 
losses in that quarter also have been considerable. When the 
want of discipline and the desertions are considered, you will 
see that there remains but a very trifling force to be scattered 
through the frontier towns, in addition to the very weak garri 
sons above mentioned. If this army be cut off, it seems to me 
that the towns cannot be all defended, and if ever it should re 
turn, a very strict defensive is the utmost which can be expected. 
</p><p>
It is proper, in this place, to say something about the plans 
and movements of the enemy. From the best information I 
have been able to procure, it seems that the Allies intended to 
open the campaign in the first fortnight of April, at which period the different armies were to be completed. The Austrians 
under the Prince de Cobourg, including those on the Moselle under the Prince de Hohenloe, were to be near ninety thousand 
strong ; the British and Hanoverians were to be twenty thou 
sand ; the Prussians, with some troops of the Empire, about 
twenty to thirty thousand. The Dutch contingent depended 
on circumstances. The scattering bodies of emigrants also 
formed an eventual force. The whole might perhaps be carried to one hundred and fifty thousand, from which it might 
be well to deduct one third for posts, garrisons, contingencies, 
maladies, and deficiencies. On the first of April, therefore, 
the Prince de Cobourg would have been at the head of at 
least one hundred thousand men, although not all united. 
</p><p>
He was obliged to commence his operations a month or six 
weeks sooner than had been agreed on, because the Prince of Hesse, commanding in Maestricht, informed him that he could 
not answer much longer for the defence of that place, a great 
part of his garrison being illy disposed, and the citizens unwilling to resist while their houses were crumbling about their ears 
I have reason to believe that the information I received of an 
offer to surrender was unfounded. In this state of things a 
council of war was held, and it was resolved to undertake, at 
all hazards, the raising of the siege. This was done by the 
Prince of Cobourg, at the head of about twenty-five thousand 
men. The Prussians, under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, 
came up the Meuse on the side of Cleves and Wezel, with a 
body of ten to fifteen thousand men, and drove the French 
from Ruremonde. The French lost in these affairs not less 
than twelve thousand men, killed, wounded, and taken, besides 
the dispersion of their troops in different directions. 
</p><p>
The stores taken at Liege were immense. Of artillery 
alone, above one hundred pieces of different caliber, as is 
said. The Austrians suffered very little, since it was rather 
a rout than a battle. The Prussians lost some men. These 
last marched, soon after, to Bois le Due, to effect a junction 
with the British troops. The Austrians prepared for action 
again as soon as they were recovered from their fatigue, and 
had made the needful dispositions. To this effect, orders 
seem to have been given to General Beaulieu to advance 
towards the Meuse from Luxembourg, and to the Prince de 
Hohenloe to replace the force of Beaulieu ; but this line being 
long and parallel to the French frontier, the movements must 
be made with caution ; and the more so, as a month was to 
elapse before the corps of Beaulieu and Hohenloe were to be 
completed. 
</p><p>
The Prince de Cobourg seems to have sent off, however, a 
column of between eight and ten thousand men on the side of 
Namur, for the purpose of dislodging the French, opening, the 
whole course of the Meuse up to the French frontier, forming 
a junction with the army of Beaulieu, and eventually cutting 
off the retreat of the French army, by possessing a post in 
their rear between Mons and Brussels, should they retire 
towards Valenciennes. 
</p><p>
Such was the state of things when Dumouriez joined the 
army, which had fallen back to Louvain. He sent off, I 
presume, his orders immediately to evacuate Holland, so as 
to form a junction with those troops, and make good his 
retreat ; but shortly after, finding that the column of Austrians just mentioned was advancing rapidly on his right, 
sensible that his enemy would, if suffered quietly to collect 
his force, be soon superior in numbers, and that his whole 
army must, in consequence, be cut off; he determined as a 
last resource, to fight them, because a victory would give him 
time to receive reinforcements, and secure the doubtful junction with the army in Holland. 
</p><p>
The army of the Prince de Cobourg must, at this time, 
have been inferior to Dumouriez, because, even supposing 
that he had collected from the Rhine men sufficient to occupy the posts in his rear, and to carry his army to the number 
of near thirty thousand, yet the detachment on his left had 
reduced it to twenty thousand. He had pushed forward his 
advanced posts to Tirlemont, but the army of Dumouriez 
drove them back, and this latter General marched forward by 
his right, so as to cut off the communication between the 
main body of the Austrians and the corps, which had been detached on their left. If under these circumstances he had 
gained a victory, it would have been decisive. It was on the 
same field that the Mareschal de Luxembourg beat King 
William, the twenty-ninth of July, <a href='/results.php?year=1693'>1693</a>, and nearly in the 
same respective positions. 
</p><p>
The event however was reversed. The action was very 
warm, and although Dumouriez writes to one of his officers 
that the retreat was a knowing or skilful one, (savante) he 
appears to be more indebted to the night, than to his general 
ship, or to the manoeuvres of his troops, for his left wing was 
cut to pieces, and his right very severely handled. The 
great superiority of the enemy's cavalry would, in those circumstances, have wholly destroyed his army, had the day 
light continued. Although we have no account of the 
enemy's loss, we may well suppose it to have been consider 
able, and of course much was to be done before they could 
attack the French, who had taken a strong post near Lou vain, 
and the more so, as by persisting in his movement to the left, 
the Prince de Cobourg might hope to prevent Dumouriez 
from getting back to the frontier towns, and in the mean time 
his reinforcements were coming on. 
</p><p>
It was under these circumstances that Dumouriez prepared 
for his retreat. To that effect, after having collected his scattered forces at Cumptich, he retired to Louvain, and sent off 
his stores and artillery from Brussels. The sick were taken 
away, as I am told, by water on the twenty-second, when the 
Commissioners from the National Assembly also left Brussels, 
and then some parties of the Austrians had, it is said, appeared 
in the neighborhood. It would seem, then, that the plan of 
Dumouriez, who is said to be on his retreat towards Mons, is 
to go to Tournai, in order to form there a junction with the 
troops from Holland, to whose protection it would seem that 
he has committed his sick and wounded, who may be forwarded to Ghent, and thence by the canals along through West Flanders to the French territory. 
</p><p>
In this way he will cover the retreat of the troops from 
Holland by the Scheldt, and the reinforcements intended for 
his army will be thrown into Valenciennes, and he himself 
will take post eventually near Lisle. This plan supposes the 
evacuation of all Flanders, which indeed seems to be indispen 
sable, for in three weeks from the present time the enemy will 
be in complete force. He may, as it were, immediately collect fifty thousand men, by bringing up the Prussian and British troops, and these again may be followed by the Dutch and 
Hanoverians. 
</p><p>
Now on the supposition that Dumouriez should extricate 
himself in the course of ten days, he would not, on the whole 
frontier from Valenciennes to Dunkirk have more than fifty 
thousand men ; and that, on the supposition that the recruits 
should have joined, to the number of ten thousand, so as to 
replace deserters and supply the deficiencies of sick and 
unfit for duty, which bear daily a greater proportion to the 
whole number, as losses in action and by desertion increase. 
</p><p>
I expect that in a very few days the campaign will open on 
the side of the Rhine, and this circumstance will leave the 
Prince de Hohenloe more master of his motions, seeing that 
a column of troops under the orders of the Duke of Brunswick 
will be of course sent to occupy the passes along the Rhine 
above Coblentz, and as the two armies of the Ardennes and the 
Moselle (which on the first of the month did not exceed 
from sixteen to twenty thousand men) cannot be increased in 
any reasonable time, beyond what may be necessary for the 
garrisons on that frontier, and to prevent the enemy from entering by the Meuse. The left of the Prince de Cobourg's 
army may bend all its efforts that way, and I daily expect to 
hear of a stroke in that quarter. 
What may be the fate of Custine, I know not. He has 
taken great pains to fortify himself, and to defend the banks of 
the Rhine from Switzerland to below Mayence ; but these 
very precautions would seem to render the passage certain, 
because it is next to impossible that a line so long should be 
defended through all its extent. 
</p><p>
. The King of Prussia seems determined to take Mayence, 
let it cost what it may. The inhabitants are universally in his 
favor, and should Custine, who is a brave but a blundering 
soldier, be taken with his army, the whole province of Alsace 
is lost. It may indeed fall in a different way, for I am well 
convinced that the imperial troops will make a serious effort in 
the upper end of it ; and here the conduct of Switzerland be 
comes important. People differ much on that subject, but I 
believe that England will have a very large body of Swiss in 
her pay to act in conjunction with the Austrian troops, and 
that having penetrated to Befort, which is but about thirty miles 
from Basil, the ulterior movement will depend on the existent 
state of things between the armies at Mayence. In one contingency an effort may be made to penetrate to Besan^on, distant 
about fifty miles, and thence to Lyons, which is distant from 
Besan^on, along the rivers Doux and Soane, by Dole and 
Chalons, about one hundred and fifty miles, but by the road, 
seventy. I need not say, that the possession of Lyons would 
oblige both Kellermann and Biron to retreat, and open the 
whole of that country to the troops of Savoy, whatever might 
have been the previous situation of those armies ; for you 
know, that on that quarter the difficulty of subsisting in the 
country is much greater than that of keeping the enemy out 
of it. 
</p><p>
I had mentioned to you, in mine of the seventh instant, my 
idea as to the recruiting, if forced forward immediately. It 
has been tolerably successful. In some places very much so. 
In others it has met with serious opposition. Upper Britanny 
is in revolt, and both Nantz and Rennes are menaced, while 
a descent is apprehended at St Malo. Does the insurrection 
proceed from a plan laid by the enemy, or from impulses of 
the moment? Both may have concurred, but I think that, 
like the campaign, it has happened sooner than was expected. 
It is, however, very serious, and should they take St Malo, 
and receive a supply of arms, ammunition, and provisions, with 
a few troops and a little money from England, it is not possible to calculate the extent of mischief; for Normandy is, I am 
persuaded, ready to revolt as soon as a fair opportunity offers ; 
and it is in that quarter, that I supposed a descent would be 
made, and I am still of that opinion, and that the movements 
mentioned in mine of the thirteenth of last month will take 
place. 
</p><p>
In the midst of these troubles, with an expense which last 
month exceeded the receipts near two hundred millions of 
livres, (worth at present prices at least four millions sterling) 
the insurrection which I formerly mentioned, as likely to take 
place against the Brissotins, is still in agitation, and will in a 
few days, most probably, take effect. 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of my letter of the 24th instant to <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, 
respecting the capture of American vessels, which will sufficiently explain itself. I ought also to mention to you, which I 
omitted in its due season, that M. Genet before he went hence 
called to take leave, and apologised for <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a>, on account 
of his constant business, for not calling on me to present M. 
Genet, &c. &c. The truth is, that I attach very little importance to these matters, whether of compliment or inattention, and I believe that I estimate them at their true 
value. I am, &c.
