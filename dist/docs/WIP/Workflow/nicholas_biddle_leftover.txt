My Dear Friend 

... I proceeded to our Capitol two days after my ar 
rival here, in order to fulfill my mission &amp; was greeted with 
all the courtesy I could wish. Fortunately the House had not 
terminated its sittings &amp; accordingly afforded me an oppor 
tunity of forming some judgment of its character. I attended 
two long debates &amp; could [have] desired to have you at my 
side at the time. Never most assuredly was there exhibited a 
more disgusting caricature of legislation. I did not expect to 
find much wisdom among them, but was truly surprised to dis 
cover that the affairs of any nation could by any possibility 
be managed by men such as the members of the House of 
Representatives. I had several meetings with the President 
and Secretary of State * &amp; saw much reason to be satisfied 
with the intentions of both. I can not venture to give an opin 
ion as to their talents. In my conferences with the Presi 
dent, I discovered a feeling towards England much more 
conciliatory than his former policies entitled me to expect.

My Dear Biddle 

... I had some conversation with Mr Erskine on his

never entertained a doubt concerning the fate of his arrange

fidence which he manifested on that subject. If our admin-

istration were admitted to a view of his instructions, they 
must have foreseen the result &amp; were in my opinion highly 
censurable for acquiescing in so extraordinary an assumption 
of authority on the part of the Minister. Mr Madison, to 
whom I communicated my apprehensions, seemed perfectly 
sure of the validity of the whole negociation. There must be 
still some lurking fallacy in this business I confess that the 
whole is a mystery to me. Whoever has been in England or 
has attended to the management of affairs in that country, 
must at once see the impossibility of a collusion between the 
ministry &amp; their envoy or of perfidy in the former. Neither 
could escape the sagacity of the opposition &amp; no ministry 
could expect to weather the storm which the exposure of so 
detestable a fraud would collect over their heads. It may, 
moreover, be easily shewn, that no views whatever of public 
or private utility could be answered by such a proceeding; or 
could have been in the contemplation of sensible men. I re 
gret, therefore, that any federalist should countenance an 
idea every way unjust and eminently injurious to the good 
cause among ourselves.

CLEMENT C. BIDDLE 1 TO BIDDLE 

Philad a . 24. Dec r . 1815. 

My dear Nicholas, 

Your letter of the 20. inst. for which, permit me to 
thank you, was rec d . yesterday. I shall avail myself of your 
kind intimations respecting the letters, and forward them 
to you by the first private hand. 

I cannot but exceedingly regret the failure of your bill for 
an immediate levy of a regular State force, satisfied, as I am, 
of the insufficiency of any scheme by voluntary enlistment, of 
obtaining the men (independent of their proper organization, 
and discipline fit for service) before the middle of the ensuing 
summer, if even by that time. My opinion is formed from 

1 Clement C. Biddle, a cousin of Nicholas Biddle and a son of Clement Biddle 
of Revolutionary fame. Commanded the Pennsylvania Regiment of Light Infan 
try Volunteers in 1812-1814, afterwards distinguished in civil life. 

my own experience in the recruiting service, when we were 
abundantly supplied with funds, and from conversations 
which I have recently had with the officer (col. Clemson) 
now superintending that service in this district. 

From a perusal of the Bill, which is now before you, the 
following objections objections have presented themselves 
to me. Sect. I st Line 4 th . In lieu of a Regiment say a Battalion 
of Artillery, which will conform to the organization of the 
U.S. Artillery: they having no Regiments, but twelve Bat 
talions of four companies each, commanded by a Lieut. Col. 
or Major. This will give a large proportion of Artillery for 
four Reg ts . of Infantry, viz. one tenth of the Inf^. General 
Scott says one twentieth is sufficient. Sect. 2 d . line 6 th after the 
organization of a Reg*, let that of the Battalion of Artillery 
come according to the U.S. viz. Four Companies Field 
of Staff, i Lieut. Col. i Adjut. I Quarter Master, i Pay 
Master, the Surgeon, the surgeon s mate, I Sergeant Major, 
i Quarter Master Sergeant and 2 Principal musicians. Line 
9 th . The U.S. organization of a Company of Artillery is much 
better than that of the Bill : it is I captain, i first Lieut. 2 
second lieut s (one of which is Conductor oj Military Stores, 
and has charge, and is responsible, for the ordnance &amp;c &amp;c.) 
I third lieut. i quarter master sergeant, 5 sergeants, 8 cor- 
porals, 4 musicians and 100 privates. Line II th . The number 
of Non Commissioned officers and privates of a company of 
Riflemen should be the same as that of Infantry. It is in the 
U.S. service the five officers are quite sufficient for the com 
mand of ninety men, and a company, which when full had but 
sixty eight men, w d not generally have in the field above forty, 
which are too few, particularly where there are so many com 
pany officers. There is an additional reason for increasing the strength of the Rifle corps, to wit, in the French and most of 
the European services, the Tiraileurs or Light Infantry bear 
to the Infantry of the Line, at least the proportion of one to 
three, whereas even after this augmentation, they w d in this 
Bill only bear the proportion of one to four, and without it of 
one to six, only half that of the French, when our Coun 
try requires a greater proportion. Sect. 3 Line 5 th . In order 
to make this enumeration complete Brigade Majors sh d be 
added, and besides Assistants and Deputies, there sh d be As 
sistant Deputies, there being officers with that title in the 
U.S. service. This section seems to imply that in the U.S. 
service the Adjutant &amp; Inspector Generals must be taken 
from the line of officers, which is not the case, and they are 
frequently taken from Citizens, as in the cases of Col 3 . 
Duane, Drayton, Powell &amp; others. The U.S. regulations re 
quire their Assistants to be taken from the line of officers. 
Also in the Quarter Master s Department in the U.S. service, 
none of the officers can be taken from the line of officers. Ac 
cording to the U.S. regulations Six Regiments should make 
three Brigades. 

Should there not be an additional section giving the officers 
rank over all officers of the militia and Volunteers of the same 
grade ? 

It may be observed that wherever this Bill differs from the 
organization of the U.S. army as to the number of officers, 
non-commissioned officers and privates in a Reg* or comp y 
it is defective, as great attention has been paid to that subject 
in the U.S. service, and many alterations made before the 
present organization was adopted. 

In lieu of the six companies of artillery which it is proposed 
to strike out, let there be jour troops of Dragoons, formed into a Squadron under a major, organized as in the U.S. service, which will then complete the formation of a "Legion," 
which this Bill contemplates. A Small corps of Cavalry will 
be much wanted. 

Excuse the irregularity with which the foregoing remarks are drawn up, &amp; beleive me with perfect esteem &amp; regard

I consider this vote as definitively settling, in advance of its 
agitation, the question of the renewal of the charter, as well 
as the subordinate question to which it [is] more immediately 
related. All my fear, now is that the Stock will again, as 
once it has before, mount too rapidly; a consequence of the 
late decision which I trust, if it appear probable, the Mother 
Bank will occasionally check by throwing into Market por

You are doubtless aware of the opposition to your administration of the affairs of the Bank over which you preside, which has recently manifested itself in your City, New York and elsewhere. The Stockholders are under the impression that your object is to keep in check the State Banks, 
and to regulate the Currency of the Country at their cost. 
This they say may not be inconvenient to you, while you 
receive the salary of President of the Bank, but it does not 
suit them. The most effectual method for you to put down 
the Opposition, is to give a dividend equal to what is usually

Dear Sir 

M r . Asbury Dickins, 3 who has had an accommoda 
tion of about $2500 in this office, has been lately called upon 
by our Board, either to reduce this debt by curtailments, 
or to give additional security therefore. This demand has 
placed Mr . Dickins in a very unpleasant situation, &amp; he will 
not be able to comply with the call, unless at very great in 
convenience to himself &amp; to his family, &amp; without being un 
just to his other creditors. In a confidential conversation with 
him, I have learned that there are pressing claims hanging 
over him to the amount of about $2500, &amp; that every dollar 
which he can spare from the economical support of his family, 
&amp; from the interest on his debts in this office, is applied to the 
liquidation of his debts. If, in addition to the sum already 
loaned to him, the Bank would lend him $2,500, he would

pay off the claims pressing upon him, &amp; would leave a stand 
ing order to be filed in the Treasury, &amp; to be recognised by the 
Secretary, to pay us $1,000 annually out of his salary, until 
his whole debt should be paid off. The security which he could 
give would not be adequate to cover this sum; but if he 
lived, and continued in office, the Bank would be sure to 
receive the whole amount of his debt. 

There are other considerations of a delicate nature, which 
would induce me [to] accede to this proposition. They cannot 
be communicated to the Board of Directors, perhaps, but 
must readily occur to you. Mr Dickins fills the confidential 
station in the Treasury, which has the management of the 
Bank accounts. He has already evinced the most friendly 
disposition towards the Bank, &amp; has in many instances, to 
my certain knowledge, rendered services materially impor 
tant to its interests. I do not say, nor do I believe, that he has 
in a single instance, gone contrary to his duty to the Trea 
sury; but I know that it is very important to have the per 
son filling his station, well disposed to the Bank, as the view 
which may be taken of the subjects referred to him, may be 
materially affected by the feelings by which he is governed. 
The report on the subjects of Government deposits in the 
Bank, made to the Senate last winter by Gen 1 . Smith, 1 
was in a great measure made from materials furnished by 
M r Dickins, from suggestions obtained from me. This of 
course, must not be talked of, nor should I have mentioned 
it, but to illustrate the idea of Mr . Dickins usefulness. Such 
is my opinion of the services rendered by him, I should 
think it good policy to give up entirely, the whole $5000, 
sooner than not to retain his friendly disposition. . . .

. . . You appear to be going on so smoothly and satis 
factorily in the management and operations of the Bank 
that no room or need of remark or advice is necessary, and 
this here to fore much abused and unpopular Bank may now 
be hoped, and said to stand so well with the public, or of all 
well informed communities and experienced men, that its 
enemies may become its friends. I hope we may so find it 
when we go forward for a renewal of its charter. Mr Rush 
has at least come out, and has done his duty well. It has 
given me surprise that he, and indeed the President, as also 
former Secretaries of the Treasury have not usually said 
something of the truth of this matter in their reports. 

I would think well of an application for a new Charter 
some time (years) before the expiration of the present, and 
would choose a tranquil fortunate session to make it in, an 
early application is reasonable &amp; proper, as a Machine of its 
extent, and Loans should know its course, and have ample

submit them to you, as recommended by himself, and renewal 
of the delegation from Kentucky, for the appointment of Di 
rectors of the Branches of the United States bank, at Lex 
ington and Louisville. The members of Congress from Ken 
tucky favourable to the new Administration, are under the 
impression, that during the late elections in that State, great 
facilities, by the state banks, were given to those persons, who 
were favourable to the re-election of Mr Adams, whilst al 
most all accomodation was withheld from the other side of the 
contest. This impression may have arisen, perhaps, from the 
fact, that the Directors were favourable to the Administra 
tion, and on that account injustice may have been done them. 
It is to be expected, where party spirit has no limit, that 
jealousies of every kind will be cherished against political op 
ponents, and by this means, the fairest course of conduct, may 
be grossly misrepresented. But, where the impression of un 
fairness exists, the effect on society and on our institutions 
may be deeply injurious, without any substantial foundation. 
It would therefore seem to be sound policy, to guard against 
every appearance of Wrong. And it is submitted with great 
deference, whether it would not be advisable to make the 
selection of Directors for the branches in Kentucky, from 
both political parties, where persons can be found belong 
ing to both, who are equally competent and entitled to the 
public confidence. 

Being friendly to the Bank myself, I should regret to see 
a political crusade got up against it. Some, I know are ready 
to engage in this course, but I wish there number may be 
small. 

I have no doubt, you will agree with me, that every monied 
institution should remain free from political connections, and

WALTER DUN TO BIDDLE 

Lexington Ky. August 14 th , 1829 
Dear Sir 

In a confidential conversation with John Tilford * 
Esq r . a few days ago, I learned that a charge of partiality had 

ready written to Levi Woodbury, later Secretary of the Treasury, in reply to 
charges against Mason and it was to follow up this complaint that he now wrote 
to Lenox. 

1 Major John Tilford, President of the Northern Bank of Kentucky. A close 

been made against the Cashier and directory of the Branch 
of the United States Bank, at this place, in the administration 
of the business of the office: of discounting more freely the 
paper of the friends of the administration than that of their 
political opponents, and thereby permitting political feelings 
to influence them in loaning the money of the Bank. 

I was, as you know, appointed, last winter, a director of 
that office; and I am the only one, in the direction, who was 
in favor of the election, and who is friendly to the adminis 
tration, of General Jackson. Since my appointment I have 
been pretty punctual in my attendance at the meetings of the 
board; and I am happy to be able to say that, since my attend 
ance there, the charge of partiality is entirely groundless : in 
no single instance have the political opinions of applicants 
for discounts, ever been mentioned by any gentleman in the 
direction; the solvency and punctuality, of the drawers and 
endorsers of offered paper, are the only questions that have 
been discussed there. In cases, too, of indulgence, the direc 
tors, in granting or refusing them, have been influenced by 
reasons affecting the interest of the Bank, and not by politi 
cal considerations. I can say more: from the character of the 
paper which became due after my appointment, but which 
was discounted before, I am certain that equal impartiality 
governed the board at the time it was discounted. 

So far, then, as my observation extends, no charge can 
be more unfounded; nor can I believe, from my acquaintance 
with the gentlemen in the direction, and particularly with 
Mr. Tilford the President, and Mr Harper the Cashier, that 
the charge was ever true. With the greatest respect I am, 

friend of R. M. Johnson of Kentucky, later Vice-President under Van Buren. Cf.

SAMUEL JAUDON TO BIDDLE 

Philadelphia, Oct r 26 th 1829 
Dr Sir, 

Agreeably to your instructions, I proceeded on Thurs 
day last to Washington City, for the purpose of inquiring 
into the reports which had reached the Government of the 
exercise at the Office in New Orleans of a political influence 
unfavorable to the present Administration. In this visit, I 
had the good fortune to be accompanied by John Hagan, 
Esquire, one of the Directors of our Office, and a personal as 
well as political friend of the President. 

Immediately after our arrival there on Friday morning, we 
called on Major Lewis, to whom I handed your letter, which 
introduced a free and full conversation. In reply to my in 
quiries he stated, that letters had been received from New 
Orleans containing accusations, in general terms, that the 
Board of the Office there were actuated in the performance 
of their duties by political feelings hostile to the Administra 
tion, but that no specific charges had as yet been made. I re- 



From Samuel Jaudon 8 3 

marked, that we could only meet general accusations by gen 
eral denials, and that I did deny in the most unqualified man 
ner that there was the least ground for the charge; that I 
could appeal confidently to the Books of the Office to shew 
that no paper had been rejected but upon sufficient commer 
cial grounds; that if any specific charges should be preferred, 
I should be able to give the most convincing proofs that our 
Board had acted only on the strictest Banking principles with 
out the least reference to party views or partialities and 
that I knew that I should be fully borne out in these asser 
tions by those of our present as well as former Directors 
who are the personal and political friends of the President. 
These statements, and others which I urged of a similar na 
ture, were unhesitatingly seconded and confirmed by Mr 
Hagan. Major Lewis expressed himself perfectly satisfied, 
and promised to communicate to the President your letter 
and our representations; and he invited us to call upon the 
President in the evening. 

We accordingly did call, and were received by the Presi 
dent in the most friendly manner. After conversing for some 
time upon general subjects, the President remarked, that 
some letters had been received from New Orleans containing 
charges against the Office there of the perversion of its in 
fluence to party purposes, but that he was pleased to find 
from your letter to Major Lewis, and from the assurances of 
Mr. Hagan and myself, that there was no foundation for 
these charges; that party feelings, he knew, often blinded the 
judgment, and led us to imagine faults where none existed, 
and that men were particularly apt to make a charge of the 
kind alluded to against a Bank which, with however good 
reason, withheld from them its favors; that he was entirely 

convinced that no hostility to his administration was exer 
cised by the Board of the Parent Bank, and that in reference 
to yourself particularly he had the most unbounded confi 
dence in the purity of your intentions; that the support which 
you had given to the financial operations of the Government 
was of the most gratifying as well as effectual kind, and that 
he wished for nothing from the Bank but its cordial and lib 
eral cooperation in matters of this nature. He should have 
been satisfied, he said, by your letter alone of the want of 
any foundation for the accusations against the Office at New 
Orleans; and from my unqualified denials as well as my readi 
ness to meet the charges, and from the testimony of Mr Hagan, 
not the least doubt remained on his mind. He appeared to be 
much gratified, that we should have paid this visit with the 
sole view of obliterating unfounded impressions, evincing as 
it did the wish of the Bank to remove all obstacles to the most 
perfect good understanding. 

Throughout our interview, which lasted for an hour, the

Dear Sir. 

If, after the receipt of your first letter, sufficient time 
had remained for any valuable interference, on your part, at 
Washington, and you had not appeared quite so confident in 
your conclusions, I should have endeavoured to prove, that 
you were under a delusion. The die is now cast; 2 it there 
fore, only remains for you, to make the best of an unpromis 
ing cause. I have no doubt the executive was perfectly sin 
cere, and of this there is internal evidence sufficient, in the 
alternative he proposes. I am confident, had the subject been 
examined by him, without influence, he never would, for a 
moment, have entertained the project of establishing a Na 
tional Bank, the dangerous tendencies of which are so entirely 
at variance with his patriotism. 

As I have trespassed thus far, I feel, as if I would rather 
proceed, than retreat, with an assurance of my best re 
spects.

From Alexander Hamilton 89 

In presenting to your consideration, the reflections that 
have occurred in my mind, I can forsee no injury, and conse 
quently offer them gratuitously. In the first place, I would 
suggest the propriety of abstaining from the expression of 
any opinion intimating a want of fairness and integrity in the 
President; I am satisfied he feels no personal hostility and 
consequently no conduct of the bank ought to create such a 
feeling. I would next observe, have no confidence in Van 
Beuren; * as an aspirant for the Chief Magistracy, he is with 
out principle, and totally destitute of sincerity. In the West, 
especially in Kentucky, the friends of the Administration are 
against you, &amp; on the majority in this State, you can make as 
little calculation; these are sufficient causes to govern this 
gentleman; he may smile and seem gratious, it will only be 
to deceive. Under these circumstances, do you not think it 
would be very unwise policy to make any application to Con 
gress, in relation to the Bank at the present session? You can 
lose nothing by the delay, and may acquire, independent of 
the opportunity to explain the character of your operations, 
the nature of the exchanges and the absolute impossibility, 
in any well regulated and decently administered Institution, 
to equalize the currency, the chance of some political changes, 
either here or in Europe, which may have propitious influence 
on the measures of our government. To anticipate any con 
gressional patronage, in the existing state of things, in direct 
opposition to the President s avowed sentiments, the secret 
but artful hostility of aiming intriguers, with the whole host 
of Jackson Papers, would be to encourage expectations, cer 
tain to be disappointed, and if unsuccessful, ruinous. There 

1 This is the accepted view of Van Buren by the followers of the Bank, as is 
shown by the later correspondence.

can be no doubt as to the difficulties you will have to encoun 
ter, and there is as little question that precaution is your only 
dependence. 

The affairs of the Bank must not be brought under discus 
sion, through any friendly suggestion; if its opponents should 
commence the charge, the defence would afford a fair oppor 
tunity for explanation, and one a less ungracious to expose the 
anti republican scheme of a government bank, and the absurd 
expectation that the currency could be equalized by any, 
however organized. It would not be more absurd to contend 
that the government ought or could regulate our exchanges 
on Europe. These variations are the rights and consequences 
of free commercial intercourse, and any influence that pre 
vents extravagant changes affects all that is desirable; and 
I venture to predict, if a perfect equality ever be established, 
it will be of short duration, a deleterious stagnation; the paper 
fountains would overflow, until the country was deluged with 
irresponsible emissions. It is not improbable, Mr Barbour, 
encouraged by the Executive thrust, may renew his proposi 
tion to sell the stock held by the Government, which would 
afford a favourable opportunity for every necessary explana 
tion; acting on the defensive, you avoid the natural preju 
dices of the mind, to prejudge and exclude information, and 
may make friends, instead of creating enemies. The nation 
can have no interest in the sale of the stock, for whatever 
may be its present price; without the interference of the 
bank, it would bring par value; if such be the fact well un 
derstood, the proposition would be defeated and the Bank 
will have gained, without risk, the opportunity for expla 
nations. 

To them who have observed the political horizon with

attention, there is no part of our internal history better 
established, than that the present affords no certain index 
of the future, lest it be to teach the lesson of prudence.

a volunteer, and while I do not transgress too far, harmless,

Dear Sir 

Yours of the 22 nd ultimo is duly received, and the re 
quest therein contained attended to as far as yet in my power, 
the President of the United States arrived in Town last Tues 
day. I done myself the pleasure of waiting on him, as an old 
friend, and at the request of a number of our most respectable 
citizens made him a tender of apartments in my house during 
his Stay in Town, which he accepted, and left us on Thursday 
last for the Hermitage; during his Stay at my house I had 
frequent opportunities, and did not neglect the subject of 
your letter. I enforced every argument that I could make bear 
on the subject, or that would be of any service in removing 
his prejudice. I brought to his view the improvement of our 
Town and Country since the establishment of this office, and 
Contrasted the year of 1826 with the present year of 1830. 
on the Subject of exchange, in the former year We generally 
paid a premium on Bills drawn on any of the Eastern cities 
of from 9 to 12 per cent; now 1830, We can obtain Checks, 
payable at one day after sight at any place where the United 
States Bank have a Branch at a premium of one half to one 
per cent which is little more than pays postage, he appears 
to be well satisfied with the facilities that the Bank have 
given to Government and individuals, in transferring their 
funds from One point to another, and acknowledges that a 
Bank such as the present only can do so. he appears to be

taken considerable pains and gave him all the information I 
consistently could on Banking Subjects and belive have 
convinced him that the Present Bank and Branches could 
not be dispenced with without Manifest injury to the Coun 
try and particularly so to this Western Country, as no other 
Currency could be Substituted. On the subject of his favour 
ite plan I touched lightly, but let him know that I thought 
it would be more dangerous to Our liberties than than the 
U S. Bank, the Only objection he appears to have to the pres- \ 
ent Bank is that a great part of the Stock is held by For 
eigners consequently the interest is taken from the Coun 
try, he is well satisfied that Politicks have no influence in 
Bank or in the Choice of Directors, and I am well convinced 
that he will not interfer with Congress on the Subject of re 
newing the Charter of the Bank. Altho on this subject he 
keeps his opinion to himself he speaks of You in the most 
exalted terms and says there is No Gentleman that can be

I gathered from a conversation with Major Lewis, of

in favor of a Bank such as he recommended to Congress, yet 
if a bill were to pass both houses, renewing the charter of 
the Bank U States with certain modifications, the President 
would not with hold his approval. What these modifications 
were, I could not distinctly understand; but I believe that

tablishing branches in the states, unless with the consent of 
the states, &amp; it was intimated that a provision of the kind 
would really be beneficial to the Bank, in as much as our 
career if the jealousy with which the States regard the Bank 
would be removed, &amp; it was not doubted but that sooner 
or later every state would solicit the establishment of a 
Branch. It was also intimated that the holding of real estate 
by the bank was very objectionable. The right to do so how 
ever, is so essential to the safety of the Bank, that it cannot 
be perceived how the relinquishment of it can be yielded. . . .

Dear Sir, 

. . . My opinion, if it be worth anything to you, is, 
that the bank ought forthwith to make application for the 
renewal of its charter. If a bill for the purpose should be 
passed, General Jackson will be more afraid to put his veto 
to it than after his re-election. If he should negative such a 
bill, the fact will go far toward preventing his re-election. 
Besides, the present congress is probably more favorable than 
the next will be to the bank. In any event, it appears to me 
to be the interest of the stockholders and officers to bring the 
matter at once to issue. . . .

Dear Sir, 

I am going on with the examination of the list of mem 
bers, with a view to ascertain who are for, and who are 
against, the renewal of your bank charter. MrLetcher, 1 of 
Kentucky, tells me that there are 74 opposition members, 
who, he is satisfied, will vote in solid phalanx for the bank. 
At least 22 of the 26 members from Pennsylvania will vote for 
it. They, added to the 74 will make 96. Nearly all the South 
Carolina, a portion of Virginia and North Carolina members, 
will vote for it; and scattering Jackson votes in all the other 
states will be obtained for the bank. Upon the most moderate 
calculation, 130 votes may be considered as certain. That 
number will leave, in the house, a minority of 84. In the sen 
ate, of 48 votes, 22 opposition members may be set down 
as certain for the bank. General Barnard 2 of our state, 
and Mr. Livingston 3 of Louisiana, General Hayne 4 and 
Judge Smith 5 of South Carolina, and Mr. Tazewall 6 of Vir 
ginia, Jackson members, are for it. These make 27, leaving 
a minority of 21. There is also General Smith of Maryland, 
making 28, and leaving a minority of 20, with the probability 
of two or three more Jackson votes. The preceding statement 
is the most unfavorable in the project congress for the 
bank. . . .

Dear Sir 

I have seen a letter from the Private Secretary of the 
President to a gentleman in this City, in answer to a com 
munication addressed to the President on the Subject of a 
renewal of the Bank Charter. The substance of that letter 
is, that the Pres dt does not consider himself pledged against 
a renewal, and that if Congress passes a Bill with proper 
modifications of the Charter his approval will not be with 
held. 

I have taken some pains to ascertain the objections to the 
present Charter, and the modifications which it is thought 
will insure the Executive sanction. I give them to you with 
the only object of putting you in possession of the views held 
on this interesting subject by those who are deep in the se 
crets and favor of the President. 

I st Prohibit the establishment of more than two Branches 
in each State. 

2. The Stock now owned by government to be sold to in-

dividuals, in a manner that will prevent a few persons from 
monopolizing it. The Sale of the Government Stock will sat 
isfy many in the North, and remove the existing objection 
of the President to a partnership between the Gov*. and a 
Corporation. 

3 rd Limit the power or capacity of the Institution to hold 
real Estate. Say, the value of that description of property in 
possession of the Bank shall not at any time exceed 10 or 
15 millions of dollars. 

4. Take from the Corporation the power to loan money 
on a pledge of merchandize. 

5. Give to the President and Directors of the Bank au 
thority to appoint two individuals to sign all the notes issued 
(for the President &amp; Cashier) and let all the paper emanate 
from the Mother Bank. 

6. The existing provisions in relation to Government de 
posits, and Direction of the Bank, to be preserved. 

7. Render the Corporation Suable in the Courts of the 
Several States by making the service of process on the Presi 
dent or Cashier of the Branch, &amp; where the cause of action 
arose, a service on the Corporation. 

It is believed that the modifications suggested will ensure 
the renewal of the Bank Charter. They are not calculated 
to impair the usefulness or efficiency of the Institution, and 
if proposed by the Corporation, they will really be adopted 
by Congress. By proposing the necessary modifications, the 
Bank will strengthen herself with the people, prevent an 
angry discussion in Congress, which might result in making 
the question of renewing the Charter a party test, and ensure 
the sanction of the Executive to the modifications solicited by 
the Bank, and adopted by Congress. 



138 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

I give you these suggestions and opinions only on account 
of the source from whence they emanate. They are urged 
with apparent zeal in favor of the Bank, and altho I am for 
bidden to mention names I have no doubt it was expected I 
would communicate their ideas to you. 

My own opinion is that the object is entirely political. The 
popularity of the President must fall in the West, 1 if his 
hostility to the Bank is continued. The letter of the Private 
Secretary urges the necessity of proper modifications, which 
cannot be suggested by the President, and from the tenor of 
that letter, and the anxiety manifested by the party here, I 
think they are desirous to have the Bank question settled by 
a renewal before the next Presidential canvass, with any 
modifications to free the Pres dt from the charge of an entire 
abandonment of his original opposition.

I have just heard a conversation which I deem sufficiently interesting to write you about, as it concerns the 
Bank of the U.S. Of its accuracy you could have no doubt did you know the individuals. 

From the Presidents message, and the Report of the Sec y of the Treasury we were all lead to believe that the powers 
that be were in favor of re-chartering that invaluable institution. Now to the facts Barry, 1 Woodbury, &amp; Taney 2 
are hostile. These three are under the influence of Blair, Lewis, Kendall &amp; C.O. who still rule our Chief Magistrate, 
and who himself is an enemy to the Bank in despite what he is made to say in his message. But on Mr . M c Lane s Report 
have we placed our hopes; now the "Globe" denounces his

so objectionable, that on being shewn to Mr M C L. he declared 
that was it published, he would send his resignation the next 
morning it was accordingly modified as it appeared in that 
paper. Neither Barry or Woodbury saw the Report until it 
appeared in print. The President of course had it submitted 
to him, and was persuaded at the time to give it his sanction. 
But has since read with satisfaction the Richmond Enquirer 
which says that it will require a majority of three fourths 
of Congress to carry the measure into a Law. 

I write you these remarks hastily, as they may be of serv 
ice to you to know the actual state of affairs at Wash 1 , in 
order to advance the all important subject which you must

being wholly disinterested I shall study brevity in my lan 
guage rather than effect. Gen 1 . Jackson s popularity has de 
clined much more among men of intelligence than with the 
great body of the people. It has especially declined in Con 
gress. But his election is as certain as his life. He hates your 
Bank and has reason enough to do so. His silly notions re-\ 
specting it have been exposed with your approbation, 
he is mortified or vexed as well as angry. 

Altho I hold his election to be certain every body else 
does not do so. But no one can doubt but that his reelec 
tion will increase the effect of his influence over this Con 
gress. 

Calhoun is friendly to your bank and he will certainly not 
be again Vice President. 1 He has little influence, but where 
it exists it is powerful and it exists among your enemies to the 
South.

LOUIS McLANE TO BlDDLE 

Washington Jan. 5. 1832 
Dear Sir, 

General Cadwallader has returned to Philadelphia, 
and I apprehend with impressions, favorable to an attempt 
to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States at the 
present session of Congress. When he consulted me upon the 
subject soon after his arrival here, I frankly &amp; distinctly dis 
couraged the attempt and on grounds which I believe well 



1 66 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

entitled to weight. Other Counsels however, and, as I think 
too sanguine expectations of support from Congress, appear 
to have had greater influence: and it has occurred to me as 
proper that I should communicate my opinions directly to you. 

I do not profess to be in a situation to become the adviser 
of the Bank, and I desire to be irresponsible for the future 
decision of the Directors and the stockholders. The position 
I occupy in the Government, however, and that in which the 
late annual report which my sense of public duty constrained 
me to make has placed me in relation to the Bank and may 
possibly place me in relation to any immediate attempt to re 
new the Charter, make it necessary for me to prevent mis 
apprehension from any quarter distinctly to state my own 
opinions. This will at least leave me uncommitted for the 
future whatever weight may be given to my views. 

I feel constrained therefore to say that I am decidedly op 
posed, both on principle and on grounds of expediency, to an 
attempt to renew the Charter of the Bank during the present 
Congress. 

The annual report, for the reasons stated in it, recommends 
the renewal of the charter "at the proper time, 7 thereby ob 
viously excluding any premature renewal which should be 
inconsistent with the principle and term of the charter and 
not necessary to the safety of the stockholders, or the inter 
ests of the debtors and convenience of the community at large. 

The charter of the Bank will not expire until one year 
after the termination of the next Congress : before that period 
Congress has no authority, without the consent of the Stock 
holders, to alter its provisions; and a law passed in the interim 
can only take effect after the expiration of the present charter. 

Unless it could be shown that all the remaining period of 



From Louis McLane 167 

the charter is necessary to accommodate the business of the 
Bank to the ultimate decision of the Government this would be 
no just pretence for requiring that decision at this time, and 
perhaps no greater motive for doing so than there was during 
the last session. To me there appears to be no such necessity; 
and it does not follow that those friendly to the institution 
could be expected to make their final decision at this time. 

In the case of such a Corporation as that of the Bank of 
the United States the Government is entitled to so much of 
the term of the Charter for the benefit of full experience and 
of amply taking the good management of the corporation, as 
may be consistent with the public interest. Independently of 
this right a subject on which there is so great a diversity in 
public opinion, involving so many important interests of all 
classes of the community, and which has already attracted a 
large portion of public attention should not be disposed of 
without again affording an opportunity of a distinct expres 
sion of the will of the people. The present Congress has not 
been chosen with any direct reference to this question, and 
there are no constitutional means of ascertaining the sense of 
the people before the elections preparatory to the 23d. Con 
gress. Favorable as I am to the continuance of the Bank, if I 
could be persuaded that a decided majority of the people of 
the United States were certainly opposed to re-chartering it 
as at present organized, I could not consent, with the prin 
ciple of Government which I hold, to forestall, by any pre 
mature action, the force of public sentiment, or to exclude 
the advantage of other counsels with a fuller knowledge of 
the subject. 

It must be obvious that both the interests of the present 
Banks and the general expediency of such an institution re- 



1 6 8 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

quire that the consideration of the subject should be separate 
from party questions, with which it has properly no concern; 
and it is equally clear that in the present state of political 
parties, whatever may be the motive of the friends of the 
Bank, it must undoubtedly be mixed up with topics alto 
gether unfavorable to a dispassionate judgement. 

It is not unreasonable to infer that these considerations will 
have their weight with the members of the present Congress ; 
who will see nothing in a refusal to legislate at present incon 
sistent with the maintenance of their own views under more 
favorable circumstances. 

I have no right, nor do I profess in any manner, to speak 
for the President; his opinions are before the Country in his 
official messages in each of which he has invited the People of 
the United States to an investigation of the subject. But in 
dependently of the views he has heretofore avowed, and how 
ever they might be ultimately affected by a deliberate ex 
pression of the will of a decided majority of the People of the 
U.S. it would be unreasonable to expect that he could now 
consent finally to foreclose the investigation which he him 
self has invited, before the public sense has been constitu 
tionally declared ascertained. 

For myself I must say that holding the principles I do and 
have here expressed, as one of the constitutional advisers of 
the President I could not consistently interpose an objection

My dear Sir 

You will perceive by the Papers to day what effect 
the Veto has had upon your Stock, and the Stockholders have 
now the satisfaction of being acquainted with the objections 
which have influenced General Jackson in refusing a renewal 
of the Charter. The period has arrived in which those inter 
ested in the Bank have no hope but from your exertions and 
the only means are to endeavour to defeat his election which 
as far as I can learn may be accomplished by opposing to him 
one or more of those Papers in this State whose influence &amp; 
circulation is great and that this can be arranged I am con 
fident. I am only anxious an immediate attack should be 
made upon him, for to be effective it must be made at once. 
I have had a conversation with Webb 2 who I am sure is 
ready, very little is required to turn this state and I think it 
can be done. I take the liberty of offering you one Suggestion, 
which is, that at the present moment of excitement it would be 
a matter of serious accommodation to the Stockholders many 
of them, if directions were given to the Branch here to lend on 
the Stock either temporarily or on the I st . of October without 
grace when they can have time to make other arrangements. I 
pray you to believe that this is disinterested as regards myself.

SAMUEL SWARTWOUT TO BIDDLE ^ 

N York 23 Nov. 1833 
My dear Sir, 

I have this moment read your kind letter of yesterday, 
and am bound to acknoledge that I do not deserve your sup 
port in the way proposed, for, from the immensely increasing 
commerce of this place, the Collector s duties have so much 
increased, that it is quite impossible for him to attend to the 
duties of a Director. Hence, it would be improper for me to 
accept it. I am nevertheless greatly obliged by your kind 
offer &amp; tender you very grateful thanks for it. 

Permit me in this letter to say a word on the subject of 
the present money pressure. It is dreadful here and no hope 
of relief excepting thro your Institution. You must be liberal 
and that to a great extent or you will destroy your friends, 
those who have hitherto sustained your cause and defended 
your course. Let me interest you to take this course, it is due 
to your numerous friends and the public at large would give 
your Institution credit for it. Now that the effect of the late 
measure has been made manifest, you can relieve the whole 
community and rely upon it you would recive due credit &amp; 
consideration for it. I speak to you, my dear Sir, with the 
freedom of a friend. Would to God the Bank would take 
a noble, liberal course and thus justify itself to the world.

I Nothing but extensive discounts, by your Institution can save 
I your friends &amp; the public in general. All the blame that has 
V hitherto been cast upon you would be turned to commenda

ing for want of aid. Surely the Institution cannot mean this ? 
Rely upon it, my dear Sir, that [if] the Bank and its Branches 
were now to open the door to the Commercial Community, it 
would make more friends than it ever had. Its power has

to ease off where it is requisite to prevent extreme suffer

of the Bank. His apprehension seemed to be, that the Admin 
was setting into action a strong sentiment of opposition to the 
Bank, on account of the reductions, &amp; that it was desirable to 
meet it, either by declarations from the Bank of interested 
moderation, or something to that effect. My only remark to

Dear Sir 

I enclose you a letter this day from my assistant Edi

ion of our friends here, that the recharter of the Bank will 
depend to a great extent, upon the result of the approaching 
election in New York; &amp; I assure you that result, depends 
upon the course of the Bank. If you extend, or if you do not 
curtail, and largely too, you must &amp; will lose the election; 
&amp; I must say in the spirit of frankness, that your friends in 
New York &amp; in Congress loudly complain that you are con 
tinually putting them in the wrong by granting relief and 
thereby rendering their prediction perfectly futile. Mr . Mar 
tin late of our State said this morning that many of his 
associates in the House feel very sore on this Lead, and begged 
that when I saw you I would say that to retain the friends it 
has, the Bank must persevere in its curtailments. 1 . . .

R. FISHER l TO BIDDLE 

New York July 7 th 1834. 

My Dear Sir 

. . . Without further preface then I assure you, there 
is much dissatisfaction in this City and State among a very 
large portion of the friends of the Bank, and those of influence 
in the Whig party and sure am I that it is increasing every 
day. 

Our Merchants and traders generally have been in hopes 
for some time past that circumstances might occur to pro 
duce a change of Policy on the part of the Government to 
wards the Bank that some happy influence might have 
sprung up at Washington, and that light might have broken 
in upon the chaos, in which the dominant party are un 
doubtedly involved. 

The adjournment of Congress has dissipated this forlorn 
hope, and they now begin to look to the present and the 
future to the former suffering under a painful evil, and to 
the latter with increased anxiety and alarm. 

1 Son of Miers Fisher, a distinguished lawyer. About 1830 Fisher moved to 
New York and established the daily paper the New York American Advocate and 
Journal which was afterwards named the New York Journal and Advertiser. He was 
a warm friend of Clay ; was twice elected municipal judge, appointed Assistant Post 
master of New York by President Tyler; and under President Taylor Appraiser 
of the Customs of Philadelphia. Simpson, Eminent Philadelphians, pp. 362-364. 

The language is general among them, "We have now no 
chance for relief, but from the Bank of the United States, 
which institution is called upon, we think by every considera 
tion to extend its loans. As regards the Institution itself, the 
best informed Financiers in the City (among whom I name 
Mr Gallatin) declare that this can be done with perfect 
regard to the Safety of the Institution and undoubtedly 
with the best possible policy. The Safety fund Banks of the 
State, under the influence of the Albany Regency, 1 have 
considerably curtailed their issues and refuse to extend 
them throwing all the odium of the present extreme scar 
city of money throughout this State upon your Bank. Gentle 
men from many counties of the State have assured me, that 
the farmers men of much influence, believe that their suf 
fering is owing to that assigned cause. The Regency presses 
are \ daily filled with articles calculated to induce this opin 
ion, and it is fast gaining ground Nay, my informants go 
much further, and declare, that the Regency are delighted 
with the present state of things, and rely exultantly for their 
success upon its continuance, believing that they, through 
the State loan, can turn the relief to their great account. 
These are the opinions of men entirely friendly to the Bank 
and they communicate their information with great re 
luctance. In this City, I pray of you to be assured, such is the 
coincidence among our merchants in this opinion, and the ex 
citement thence resulting, that I have no doubt measures will 
shortly be taken (should things remain as they are) that can 
not fail to have the most unhappy effect upon the Bank, and 
the great cause of Constitutional freedom. Indeed I have

it would best comport with his success to go for A Na

ALEXANDER HAMILTON TO JOHN WOODWORTH * 

New York Sep r . 14. 1834. 

Dear Sir 

The success of your exertions at the ensuing election 
will mainly depend on the course to be pursued by the Bank; 
the Colera and the drought have done some service, but you 
alone can prevent an active fall trade in our agricultural prod 
ucts. The regency have resolved, through the Safety Fund 
Banks, to grant every facility to raise, if possible, the price 
of grain about the commencement of October, in order to 
satisfy the farming interest that our embarrassments have 
passed away and that their policy had placed the future 
prosperity of the country on a permanent footing this im 
pression is now gaining ground and unless counteracted will 
give us an uphill labour ... 

... It has been found expedient to abandon the Bank in 
our political pilgramage. The people are now familiarly ac 
quainted with the immense power of a national bank and ap 
prehend all kinds of terrible consequences from its exercise, 
without ever reflecting that in every human institution, pos 
sessing the ability to do much good, their must necessarily 
exist the power to do essential mischief, and that all legisla 
tion is more or less subject to the same charge. . . .

WILLIAM B. REED * TO BIDDLE 

Harrisburg. Dec r . 12. 1835. 

Dear Sir, 

I have intended from day to day to write to you, but 
the very caution and reserve which we are obliged to main 
tain in relation to the Bank measure operate to prevent any 
development of feeling and opinion, worth communicating. 
I now esteem it especially fortunate that a friend of the Bank 
was placed at the head of the Improvement Committee. 
That is the only engine on which we can rely and if it fails we 
have no chance. Every one at all acquainted with matters 
and things here, particularly of late years since the Canal 
policy has been pursued, knows that the temptation of a turn 
pike, or a few miles of canal and rail road as a beginning on a 
favorite route is nearly irresistible, and I am strongly inclined 
to think that now a few of the many members who have toiled 
year after year for branches, and who look to this session as

From William B. Reed 259 

their last chance could vote against legislation that would 
give them their extensions and entrench upon nothing but 
party prejudices and antipathies. If this feeling cannot be 
operated on, none other can. An this applies to those who are 
here not as friends of the state administration and who per 
haps not being unwilling to see it embarassed could not be 
operated upon by the measure, if its effect was to be merely 
a general relief from taxation. A reference to the map and 
the Senatorial Districts will illustrate this. The Southern line 
of Rail Road to connect through York and Gettysburg with 
the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road and thence down the 
Younghegany to Pittsburg would of itself affect the votes of 
at least three if not four Senators. So with the Erie extension 
the North Branch, the West Branch survey (all that that Dis 
trict wants). With respect to all these new lines it must be 
borne in mind that the commencement of the work is all that 
will be wanted. To be able to go home and boast of having 
made a beginning is all that is needed. . . . There is another in 
terest too which must not be overlooked in the Turnpikes 
relief to them no matter how small a pittance, will be most 
gratefully received. By the bye, I understand the Canal 
Commissioners, in their Report take up the tune of the 
Message and assuming the abundance of funds recommend 
all the extensions as a matter of course. 

With all these views you will easily understand why I con 
sider the Improvement Committee, aided as it may be by 
the Committee of Ways and Means, a powerful engine to ef 
fect our purpose. I shall be glad to have your views in strict 
confidence as to the course which true policy dictates as re 
spects new banks and increased capital. Petitions are rush 
ing in upon us from all quarters. The Chairman of the Com- 

mittee on Banks, Mr Pennypacker, is one of the soundest 
men we have. His idea is to delay action even in Committee 
upon all these new banks, and having ascertained the precise 
amount of proposed capital to use it as an argument for the 
U.S. Bank. This may do very well so far as our city is con 
cerned but I am inclined to doubt the policy in its general 
application. For example a very strong and respectable ap 
plication has been made for a new bank at Pittsburg where 
it seems to be conceded since the closing of the branch that 
more banking capital is needed. From what I learn from 
third persons I find that all the Pittsburg members and their 
friends in the lobby attribute the dilatory action of the Com 
mittee who have refused thus far to report a bill, to a secret 
design on the part of the friends of the U.S.B. to promote 
its views. They are consequently utterly opposed to the char 
ter. All this I hear indirectly but still I can depend on it. 
Would it not be better in such a case only, for the friends of 
the U.S.B. to gain the Pittsburg influence by aiding their 
project? 

I shall be very glad to have your views on this subject par 
ticularly as well as on all others connected with the great 
object we have in view. Whatever you may write I shall 
consider strictly confidential and for my own guidance. It is 
however essential that I should be fully apprised of all your 
views. . . . 

You are at liberty to show this letter to Mr Sergeant &amp; to 
any of our common friends. 1

SAMUEL R. WOOD TO BIDDLE 

Harrisburg 2mo loth 1836 
My dear friend 

I wrote to thee yesterday by Jacob Louder who left 
at Midnight and who was to leave my letter &amp; others at 
Smith &amp; Hodgson s store and I hope thee got it early in 
evening. 

A strange scene has been played off in Senate this day. 
After the usual morning business Mr Fullerton of Franklin 
Co. rose in his place and said, that the Reporter &amp; Journal of 
yesterday contained a direct charge of an offer made to bribe 
an honourable senator, &amp; that he was unwilling to proceed 
untill an investigation was entered into; &amp; moved that the 
Sergant of Arms be directed to bring forthwith to the bar of 
the Senate Samuel D. Patterson &amp; O. Barrett the editors of 
said paper this resolution was adopted with very little 
debate, and in about half an hour these two gentlemen were 
at the Bar. Patterson had not written the article or Knew 
any thing about it, but the other avowed having written 
it &amp; stated that Jacob Krebs, the Senator from Schuylkill 
County was his informant. That he heard from another 
person that such an offer had been made to Krebs about 
ten days ago. That he called on him, asked him if the report 
was true &amp; was informed by him that it was, but that he would 
not tell the name of the individual who made the offer of the 
bribe. The evidence of Barrett was not concluded untill 
dinner time when the Senate adjourned untill half past 3 
o clock. Mr Krebs was then called upon &amp; he read from his 
place a statement of the offer. I did hope to have been able 
to have got a copy of this, but the committee are not willing 
to let it go out. The substance of it is that James L. Dunn of 
Reading came to him in the Senate Chamber on the 28 th of 
last month and stated that if this Bank Bill should pass that 
his (Dunns) coal lands in Schuylkill County would very 
much advance in price, and wished Krebs to vote for the Bill. 
That if he would, he (Dunn) would give Krebs one half of the 
amount of the rise which he estimated at 4,000 dollars but 
that should the lands raise in value ten thousand dollars 



From Samuel R. Wood 267 

which they might, that he would in that case give him five 
thousand dollars. Krebs gave him no answer on that evening. 
Dunn called next morning and pressed it on him but he de 
clined and afterwards avoided Dunn. 

That on the 3&lt;D th of January or first of March Henry W. 
Conrad a member of the House of Representatives from 
Schuylkill County told Krebs that he would insure him 
twenty thousand dollars if he would vote for the Bank Bill, 
and that if he agreed to it Bird Patterson would make the ar 
rangement and that he should have the money in two weeks 
after the Bill passed after the Senator had read his state 
ment a motion was made to appoint a committee with power 
to send for persons &amp; papers which was agreed to &amp; Baker, 
Toland, Leet, Strohm &amp; Langston named as the Committee 
when the Senate adjourned. 

How Dunn will get out of it is doubtful but all believe that 
Conrad was only in jest and that the old man was weak 
enough to take it for earnest for there was two or three per 
sons present when Conrad made the offer. Conrad has been 
one of the most violent and determined opposers of the Bill 
in the House. The violent opposers here have endeavoured to 
produce an excitement out of this matter &amp; are woefully dis 
appointed. They have evidently weakened themselves by it 
and look discouraged &amp; ashamed. The friends of it bore them 
much and are in high spirits as to the result. They will take 
up the Bill to-morrow and I hope nothing will interrupt its 
passage. 1 

1 The "Krebs affair," mentioned in the above letter became the main issue in 
the latter part of the passage of the Bank Bill. Committees were appointed in 
both the Senate and the House. The Senate Report disclosed the fact that Patter 
son had not approached Krebs directly, but indirectly through Conrad; that the 
former had authorized Conrad to request Krebs to offer an amendment to the bill

J. R. INGERSOLL TO BIDDLE 

House of representatives 

Washington March 17 th 1836 
My Dear Sir 

M r Evans of Maine has exhibited to me a letter from 
certain Gentlemen to the East who are anxious to know the 
views of your Bank with regard to the establishment of 
branches or agencies, in other states. They have in view a 
branch or agency in Bangor: and desire to know whether they 

to get an appropriation to the Danville &amp; Pottsville Railroad; but Patterson denied 
that Krebs had been told "he might retire to private life independent if he voted 
for the measure." Therefore the committee reported that they were perfectly 
convinced that neither the Bank of the United States nor any agent of it were 
either implicated in the charge of bribery or had improperly interfered to promote 
its passage. The House Report was along the same lines and reached the same 
conclusion. Cf. American Sentinel, February 15, 1836; National Gazette, February 
18, 1836; Pennsyka-nian, February 18, 1836; New York Journal of Commerce, Feb 
ruary 16, 1836; Niles, April 9, 1836. 

Throughout the whole episode the correspondence of the agents of the bank to 
Biddle had taken about the same stand as that of the House Committee. Mcllvaine, 
writing on February 5, stigmatized the affair of old Krebs as a "humbug"; Todd 
described the case as "all smoke "; while Wallace wrote he was unable to determine 
whether Krebs was "so utterly stupid as not to understand the meaning &amp; nature 
of a bribe or so wicked as to pervert perfectly innocent conversations to political 
profit." 

The bill re-chartering the old Bank was signed February 18. From all sides 
Nicholas Biddle received the congratulations and plaudits of his friends. The stock 
of the Bank rose from 125 to 129 in less than a week, and property in Erie, Penn 
sylvania, doubled in value. (Cf. Russell to Buchler, February 28, 1836, in Wolf 
MSS. in Pennsylvania Historical Society Library.) In the United States Senate 
Ewing of Ohio triumphantly proclaimed the re-charter, while Calhoun renewed 
his attacks on the Administration. But the opponents of the old United States 
Bank did not falter in their opposition. The Ohio Legislature passed a bill pro 
hibiting the establishment of agencies or branches in that state, much to the sur 
prise and alarm of Biddle and his friends (cf. Pennsylvania, March 25, 1836). 
Rumors were likewise circulated regarding the supposed antagonism of Virginia 
and New York (ibid., February 24, 1836). Even President Jackson contemplated 
action against the bill when draftirfg the Specie Circular. This is disclosed in the 
Jackson MSS. in a memorandum containing an addition to the Treasury Circular. 
This is endorsed by Jackson "to be considered as to the present or future time."

would be conducted subject of course to the parental direc

$500,000 with the right to increase it from time to time as the 
business may warrant. . . . 

While I have been writing at my desk a neighbour of mine 
has asked me whether it was the design of the Bank to estab 
lish an agency at Erie. He resides at Buffalo and thinks that 
the business which has heretofore been conducted at that 
place may be without difficulty transferred to Erie.

STEPHEN F. AUSTIN l TO BIDDLE 

Philadelphia April 9. 1836. 
Sir, 

As the enclosed memorandum embraces the outlines 
of the Loan for Texas on which I conversed with you this 
morning, I take the liberty of handing it to you. 
^ I should esteem it as a favor, if I could be informed within 
a short time, whether you think any thing could be effected 
in this matter. 

I consider the cause of Texas is the cause of freemen, and of 
mankind, but more emphatically of the people of the United 
States than any other. I flatter myself that you view it in the 
same light, and that the security we offer is good, and there 
fore have no doubt you will give to it the attention which its 
importance merits. 

The leading men of all parties in Washington are favor 
ably disposed towards Texas. A reference to them will, I 
think, satisfy all persons as to this fact.

secure recognition of the United States.

GENERAL ROBERT PATTERSON TO BIDDLE 

Confidential Washington 8 May 1837 

My dear Sir 

I called this morning on Mr Van Buren and had nearly 
an Hours conversation with him going over the whole 
ground he is evidently in an unpleasant position 1 con 
scious of the impending danger and yet anxious to avoid 
doing anything which might appear to be a departure from 
the policy of his predecessor . . .

B. W. LEIGH TO BIDDLE 

Richmond, Aug. 21. 1837. 
My dear sir 

I am informed, that the hon e William Smith, formerly 
of South Carolina, now of Alabama, has recently, in a public 
speech to the people of Huntsville, and on other occasions, 
stated that the late chief justice Marshall l owned seven 
teen shares of stock of the Bank of the U.States, at the time 
he decided, in the case of M c Cullock against the State of 
Maryland, that the charter of the Bak was constitutional. 
The argument of that cause was opened on the 22nd Febru 
ary 1819, and the chief justice delivered the opinion of the 
court on the 7 th March; 4 Wheat. 316, 322, 40x3. 

1 For a discussion of the Marshall affair, cf . Niles, September 23, 1837, pp. 50-51 ; 
ibid., December 2, 1837, p. 218; ibid., June 2, 1838, pp. 210-211. 



284 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

The most innocent purpose for which such a statement 
could have been made, was to detract from the weight of the 
chief justice s authority on the point of constitutional law; 
which Mr Smith, it seems, was willing to accomplish, by im 
puting to him a personal interest in the controversy. I say 
nothing about the motive or the candor of such an imputa 
tion, or of the evidence it affords of Mr Smith s scale of moral 
sentiment and honor. 

I find upon examination of the Dividend Books of the office 
of the Bank at this place, that Mr Marshall received the 
dividend of July 1817 on 12 shares; and the dividends on 
17 shares, of January 1818, July 1818, and January 1819; and 
that his receipt for this last dividend is dated Jan y 23, 1819, 
just before he left home to attend the supreme court, the 
term of which then commenced on the I st February. From 
thenceforth he never received any dividend (because, I infer, 
he never owned any stock) in his own right tho there was 
some stock standing in his name and mine as joint exors of 
G. K. Taylor of Petersburg, which I bought and always drew 
the dividends of and, at a later period, some stock standing 
in his name as trustee for the widow and children of his 
brother William Marshall. It follows, that he must have 
sold his own 17 shares of stock, after the dividend of January 
1819 was declared; but we cannot ascertain here the precise 
date when he parted with it. I have not the least doubt, that 
he sold this stock before he left home in January or Feb 
ruary 1819. 

Now I must beg the favor of you to ascertain the date of 
the transfer of that stock, on the the transfer book* at Phila 
delphia, the person to whom he transferred it, and (as he 
must have transferred by attorney) the date of the letter of 



To B. IT. Leigh 285 

attorney; and to give me the precise dates, and a copy of the 
letter of attorney and of the authentication subjoined to it. 
Have the goodness also, to have the facts stated in the form 
of a certificate signed by the proper officer of the Bank. 

You may perhaps think I am taking over unnecessary 
trouble about this affair but I do so at the request of a 
friend at Huntsville and besides, I am persuaded, that if 
a grave charge of forgery, or perjury, or sheep stealing, were 
made against the most honest and honorable man in the 
country, it would do him some harm; so general is the be 
lief of the universal corruption of the nation. I am, sir, with

luckily attested by the James H. Lynch of this town ; and I im 
mediately resorted to him for information as to the date at 
which Mr M. parted with his property in that stock. Mr L. 
has furnished me conclusive proof, that that stock was 
sold to him at par, and paid for, on the 2ist January 1819, 
the date of the letter of attorney; and he says, moreover, 




288 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

that he advised Mr. Marshall, at the time, not to sell his 
stock, but he assigned as his reason for selling it, that he did 
not choose to remain a stock holder, as questions might be 
brought before the supreme court in which the Bank might 
be concerned. Mr . L. does not remember certainly to whom 
he sold these shares of stock; but the scrip and the letter of 
attorney probably passed thro several hands before they 
came to those of Mr Wilcox, who sent them to Mr Cope. 
But this is wholly immaterial, and I shall not take the trouble 
to write to Mr W. about it. 

You shall be informed what I do in this affair. Do not 
doubt that I will give the Hon William Smith such a rap over 
the knuckles as he deserves. But that is not all I have to do 
the gentleman who informed me of this mean and base slan 
der on Mr Marshall s memory, said, that Mr Smith "made 
the statement upon the authority of a U.States Senator now 
representing Virginia." I cannot believe that he had any 
such authority; and I suspect he has slandered our Senators 
as well as Mr Marshall. But if it shall turn out that he 
vouched any such authority, and that either of our present 
Senators made any such communication to him, that Senator 
shall hear of it, and that in such a manner that he shall not 
forget it for the remainder of his days.

B. W. LEIGH TO BIDDLE 

Richmond, Sept. 4. 1837. 
Dear Sir 

You must pardon me forgiving you a little more trouble. I find from the dividend book of the office of the bank of 
U.States at Richmond, that Gen. J. B. Harvie of this town, the son-in-law of the late chief justice Marshall, received the 
dividends on ten shares of stock, of July 1817, January and July 1818, and January 1819, and thenceforth afterwards he 
never received any dividend on any of the stock. From a conversation I have had with Gen. H. this morning, I apprehend that these shares were originally purchased by Mrs Marshall the wife of the chief justice, but the transfer of it 
was made to Gen. H. and the stock stood in his name, tho in fact as trustee for her she had a sort of separate property, which she managed for herself and disposed of the 
profits of it, or the principal, among her children, at her own pleasure. Gen. H. says this stock was given to him; Mr Mar 
shall telling him at the time, that he wished to divest him self of all manner of interest in the bank, because there was 
suits pending (or might be such suits) in the supreme court in which the bank was concerned. But Gen. H. does not re 
member the precise date of the gift to him. 

I beg you to get the transfer clerk to give me the precise date when, and the person to whom, Gen. H. transferred 
these ten shares of stock, and to send me a copy of his power of attorney for the transfer of it and oblige

The result of the elections 1 in this state is such as to 

1 The New York election was viewed with great interest during these months 
of distress, and it was evident that the outcome would be closely associated with 
the panic in the money market. The symptoms of a division in the Democratic 
Party in relation to banks and banking was early exhibited in New York. (Ham 
mond, J. D., The History of Political Parties in New York, Buffalo, 1850, vol. II, 
pp. 462, 463.) The spring elections in the city of New York resulted in the choice of 
a Whig Mayor, and coming as they did in the midst of hard times "prepared the 
way for the avalanche in the fall." A little later the Sub-Treasury issue began to*\ 
assume prominence in the politics of the state. Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, a Demo 
cratic United States Senator, openly opposed Van Buren s policy and endorsed 
Seward for governor of the state. Van Buren s message in September created a stir 
in Democratic ranks and was received with much displeasure by the Tammany 
men. The Whig papers rejoiced in the discomfiture of their enemies while the 
Democratic papers predicted a gloomy outlook for the Albany Regime. (New York

vote against it and will obey; Mr Rives 2 is firmly opposed 
to the bill in its present shape, and Mr . Talmadge will make 
a great effort to defeat it. Morris 3 of Ohio will obey in 
structions if they should be received in time, but Allen 4 it is 
said will not. Mr Cambrelling is confident of the passage of 
the Bill in the Senate, but thinks it will meet with more diffi

consent to discuss any project for a National Bank of Dis

to try the experiment of collecting and disbursing the reve

result of my friends mission is very satisfactory. As He was 
commissioned by me for the purpose of ascertaining the 
views entertained by the President toward the Bank of the 
United States he turned his attention to that subject entirely. 
He urged upon the President the absolute necessity there 
was of abandoning the present policy and hinted that in his 
opinion the only way of defeating Mr Clay was by making 
Peace with the Bank of the U States. The President received 
his Hint in a very gracious manner and said he was in the 
Hands of the poeple and If thay resolved to have the Govern 
ment connected with the Bank He the President would not 
oppose the will of the majority when it had been clearly ex 
pressed. The President agreed with him that if Mr Rives of 
Virg a could be reconciled it would be accomplishing much to 
wards a Reconciliation of the differences that had recently ex 
isted in the party. This would be a death blow to the Con 
servative party and then remarked my friend would not the 
withdrawing of the Bank of the United States from the whig 
party produce the same effect upon them (the Whigs) as the 
loss of Mr Rives would be to the Conservative Interest. The 
president remarked, it is entitled to consideration, my im 
pression is it would. To sum up my friend is impressed with 
the Idea that the President is personally very anxious for a 
Reconciliation and If Mr Rives will consent to run as Vice 
president theire would be no difficulty in making the arrange 
ments. All the best plans of getting back to the old Land 
marks of the party were discussed the disposition to be 
made of Blaire &amp; others conditioned an arraingement of this 
Kind were entered into was glanced at and considered per 
fectly feasible. The greatest difficulty appeared to be the con

My dear Sir 

. . . The Sub Treasury bill cannot now be repealed too soon it is believed at Washington that the House will 
repeal it if the Senate will, and it is thought there that with the Penn: Senators a majority of the Senate will vote its 
repeal. Buchanan I understand has said that if he is instructed to repeal it he will resign. Your Legislature is Whig is it not practicable to get them instructing your Senators. 
Such a movement would Come well &amp; with great power from your State. We could instruct Mr Wright in our State but he 
does not give faith to the doctrine. It might not be amiss to get Mr Webster s views on the Subject. The Sub Treasury 
being out of the way The Bank must step in.
