Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inclose to your Excellency 
some acts passed at the last session of our Legislature, by which you will see, in some measure, the 
disposition of this State to comply with the views of 
Congress, as well as to grant such further powers as 
may render the Confederation more competent to the 
purposes of the Union. 
</p><p>
The act for the levying our proportion of one million five hundred thousand dollars, exclusive of the 
impost, and empowering Congress to collect the same, 
will by no means raise so large a sum; it being only 
a land-tax of sixpence on every hundred acres of land, 
and a poll-tax of one shilling and sixpence on all 
white males from twenty-one upwards, and on all 
slaves from twelve years old to fifty. It establishes 
the principle recommended by Congress ; and, I trust, 
the good sense of this, and the other States, will 
soon, if they do not already, see the necessity of establishing solid and effectual revenues to enable Congress to perform their engagements. 
</p><p>
The members of the Legislature could not consent 
to vote the full sum required, after they had ceded 
all the lands westward of the Appalachian Mountain. 
They urged it was not necessary, since Congress were 
in possession of the cessions of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Virginia, 
and North Carolina. The cession of our western 
lands was much debated and opposed. The House 
of Commons were long divided whether to make the 
Tennessee, Cumberland Mountain, or the Appalachian, 
our Western boundary ; but finally passed the act as 
you see it, fifty-three against forty-one. There are, 
within our cession, more than three thousand men 
able to bear arms. 
</p><p>
The recommendation of Congress, respecting the 
fifth article of the treaty, is not complied with, nor 
is there any thing done to carry the treaty into effect ; and I suspect it will be difficult to induce us 
to think aright on this subject (although our citizens 
seem well disposed), while we have ambitious, discontented spirits, whose popular existence depends on 
fanning the passions of the common people against 
the refugees. The stale cry of peculation and embezzlement of the public money, aided by complaints 
of hard times and heavy taxes, was never listened to 
with more avidity, than the clamors against the refugees and payment of British debts ; and this, too, by 
men who cannot possibly be gainers if all bond fide 
debts were wiped off with a sponge ; but who must, 
assuredly, share in the disgrace of their country, by 
such shameful, unwarrantable conduct. 
</p><p>
I have not, in this State, heard a single objection 
to the commutation, or rendering ample justice to the 
army. Early in the spring there was circulated the 
pamphlet said to be written by Burke, of South Carolina, against the institution of the <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>, which 
gave some uneasiness to some people, who were apprehensive the institution would be productive of an 
aristocracy dangerous to the principles of our Governments. But a little reflection, with the remembrance of the patience, perseverance, and sufferings 
of the army, in defence of their just rights and liberties, has worn down the suspicions in some measure, 
and will, I hope, teach them to put their trust in 
those who, in the worst of times, stood the constant 
sentinels over the liberties of their country, and to 
suspect those who haA^e screened themselves in the 
hour of danger, and now step forth to revile the virtuous well-doer, and his endeavours to adopt wise and 
equitable measures. 
</p><p>
The Legislature has changed the annual election 
from March to August, and the annual meeting will 
be in October. I hope they then will amend such of 
our acts as are imperfect, and pass such others, respecting the treaty, as may be consonant with the 
wishes of those who are for wise and equitable measures. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
