DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By this express you will receive advice from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> of our evacuating Canada, an event 
which I make no doubt (from our distressed situation) you have some time expected. The particulars of General Thompson's repulse and captivity, as 
nearly as could be ascertained, have been transmitted 
you. On advice of which, [with] very direct intelligence that the enemy were greatly superior to us in 
numbers, I advised <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> to secure his 
retreat by retiring to St. John s. He was determined 
to keep his post at Sorel, if possible, and did not 
retire until the 14th instant, at which time the enemy 
were as high up with their ships as the Sorel. 
</p><p>
On the 15th, at night, when the enemy were at 
twelve miles distance from me, I quitted <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
with my little garrison of three hundred men. The 
whole army, with their baggage and cannon (except 
three heavy pieces left at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>), arrived at St. John's the 17th, and at the Isle-aux-Noix the 18th; 
previous to which it was determined, by a Council of 
War at St. John s, that in our distressed situation, 
(one half of the army sick, and almost the whole destitute of clothing and every necessary of life, except 
salt pork and flour), it was not only imprudent, but 
impracticable, to keep possession of St. John's. 
</p><p>
Crown Point was judged the only place of health 
and safety, to which the army could retire and oppose the enemy. It was found necessary to remain 
at the Isle-aux-Noix for some few days, until the sick, 
heavy cannon, &c., could be removed. <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> did not choose to leave the Isle-aux-Noix until he 
received positive orders for that purpose, and thought 
it necessary for me to repair to this place, and wait 
on <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a>. I arrived here last night, and 
am happy to find him of our sentiments in quitting 
the Isle-aux-Noix, which, from its low situation, is rendered very unhealthy, and from the narrow channel 
leading to it from the north part of Lake Champlain, 
of six miles in length and from three to eight hundred yards in breadth, is rendered very insecure, as 
the enemy, by light pieces of cannon and smallarms, 
might render all access to it dangerous, if not impracticable. 
</p><p>
It now appears to me of the utmost importance, 
that the Lakes be immediately secured by a large 
number of (at least twenty or thirty) gondolas, row-galleys, and floating batteries. The enemy, from undoubted intelligence, have brought over a large number (it is said one hundred) frames for flat-bottomed 
boats, designed to be made use of on Lake Champlain ; and, from their industry and strength, will 
doubtless become masters of the Lake, unless every 
nerve on our part is strained to exceed them in a 
naval armament. I think it absolutely necessary, that 
at least three hundred carpenters be immediately 
employed. Fifty sent from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who are acquainted with building that kind of craft, would greatly facilitate the matter. 
</p><p>
A particular return of the army could not be obtained, in our hurry and confusion. It will be transmitted to you in a few days. I believe the whole 
about seven thousand, and at least one half of them sick and unfit for duty, but daily recovering. Upwards of one thousand more are yet to have the 
smallpox. The enemy, from the best intelligence that can be obtained, are near ten thousand, exclusive of Canadians and savages. Few of the latter have joined them as yet. 
</p><p>
I make no doubt it will be thought necessary to 
repair Crown Point, or build a new fort near that 
place. The former, from the advantage of its situation, and the fine barracks nearly completed, will, I 
believe, be thought most proper. I make no doubt 
but <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, who I am happy to hear is on 
his way here, will pay immediate attention to it. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself our arms, under your immediate 
direction, will meet with more success than they have 
done in this quarter. I make not the least doubt 
our struggles will be crowned with success. I am, 
with every friendly wish, most respectfully, dear General, your affectionate and 
</p><p>
Obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
