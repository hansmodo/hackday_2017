My dear Sir : I have had the good fortune to meet here our friend Mr. Babbitt, the Secretary of the Territory, who is on his way to Washington, in charge of the mail and other 
very interesting despatches, the importance of which is urging him forward with extreme rapidity. He passes directly on this morning, and I 
have barely a few moments to give you intelligence of our safe arrival and of our general good health and reasonable success in the object of our expedition. 
</p><p>
This winter has happened to be one of extreme and unusual cold. Here, the citizens inform me, it has been altogether the severest 
since the settlement of this valley ; consequently, so far as the snows are concerned, the main condition of our exploration has been fulfilled. 
We entered the mountain regions on the Huerfano River on the 3d of December, and issued from it here on the 7th of this month, arriving 
here yesterday afternoon. We went through the Coochatope Pass on the 14th December, with four inches, - not feet, take notice, but 
inches - of snow on the level, among the pines and in the shade on the summit of the Pass. 
This decides what you consider the great question, and fulfils the leading condition of my explorations ; and therefore I go no further into details in this letter. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on this verification of your judgment, and the good prospect it holds out of final success in carrying the road by this central line. Nature has been bountiful to this 
region in accumulating here, within a few miles of where I am writing, vast deposits of iron and coal and timber, all of the most excellent quality ; and a great and powerful interior State 
will spring up immediately in the steps of the Congressional action which should decide to carry the road through this region. In making my expedition to this point, I save nearly a 
parallel of latitude, shortening the usual distance from Green River to this point by over a hundred miles. In crossing to the Sierra Nevada, 
I shall go direct by an unexplored route, aiming to strike directly the Tejon Passes, at the head 
of the San Joaquin valley, through which, in 1850, I drove from two to three thousand head of cattle that I delivered to the Indian Commissioners. I shall make what speed I possibly can, 
going light, and abandoning the more elaborated survey of my previous line, to gain speed. 
</p><p>
Until within about a hundred miles of this place, we had daguerreotyped the country over which we passed, but were forced to abandon 
all our heavy baggage to save the men, and I shall not stop to send back for it. The Delawares all came in sound, but the whites of my 
party were all exhausted and broken up, and more or less frost-bitten. I lost one, Mr. Fuller, of St. Louis, Missouri, who died on entering this 
valley. He died Like a man, on horseback, in his saddle, and will be buried like a soldier, on the spot where he fell. 
</p><p>
I hope soon to see you in Washington. Mr. Babbitt expects to see you before the end of March. Among other documents which he 
carries with him, are the Maps and Report of Captain Gunnison's party. 
</p><p>
Sincerely and affectionately, 
</p><p>

P.S. This is the Little Salt Lake settlement, and was commenced three years since. Population now four hundred, and one death by 
sickness since the settlement was made. We have been most hospitably received. Mr. Babbitt has been particularly kind, and has rendered me very valuable assistance.

<sup>*</sup> Valley of the Parawan, about sixty miles east of the meadows of Santa Clara, between 37 and 38 degrees of 
North latitude, and between 113 and 114 degrees of west longitude ; elevation above the sea about 5,000 feet.
