My dear General, 
</p><p>
I have received your affectionate letter of the 8th j 
and from the known sentiments of my heart to you, 
you will easily guess what my feelings have been in 
perusing the tender expressions of your friendship. 
</p><p>
No, my beloved General, our late parting was not by 
any means a last interviev/. My wliole soul revolts 
at the idea ; and could I harbour it an instant, indeed, 
my dear General, it would make me miserable. I well 
see you never will go to France. The inexpressible 
pleasure of embracing you in my own house, of welcoming you in a family where your name is adored, 
I do not much expect to experience; but to you I 
shall return, and, within the walls of <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, 
we shall yet often speak of old times. My firm plan 
is to visit now and then my friend on this side of 
the Atlantic ; and the most beloved of all friends I 
ever had, or ever shall have anywhere, is too strong 
an inducement for me to return to him, not to think 
that whenever it is possible I shall renew my so 
pleasing visits to Mount Yernon. 
</p><p>
Since I have left you, my dear General, we have 
passed through <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, where I was 
happy to find a numerous and well-chosen Congress. 
Their testimonies of kindness to me, and my answer 
to them, you will see in the newspapers. As to my 
services abroad, it has been (on motion respecting 
what I told you) universally decided that public confidence in me was a matter of course, a doubt of 
which ought not to be expressed. But, as I know 
the sense of the Congress, and as <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a> has accepted, and Mr. Jeflerson will be Minister in France, 
my situation in that respect will be very agreeable. 
</p><p>
Orders have been sent to Canada to reenforce the 
Lake posts, put the vessels in commission, and repel 
force by force. But I. think that if once Congress 
have the trade to regulate, mercantile interdictions <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will set these people to rights. Although party spirit 
had a little subsided in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, yet that city is 
not by any means settled. How far from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ! 
</p><p>
Although your nephew is not arrived, I will hope 
for the pleasure to see him in Paris. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met friend'>General Greene</a> 
was in <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> when the letter reached him, from 
where he came to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and I had the pleasure 
to spend some days with him. Inclosed I send you 
a small cipher. Should any public political business 
require a fuller one, I will write to you a complete 
cipher I have had long ago with <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>'s present 
department. 
</p><p>
Mr. Carey, printer of the Volunteer journal, has been 
obliged to fly for his life, and now lives at Mr. Sutler's, hatter. Front street, in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he is 
going to set up a paper. A letter from you, becoming a subscriber, and telling him I have mentioned it 
to you, will the most oblige me, as I have promised 
him to recommend him to my friends. He is now 
an American; and we have nothing to do with his 
quarrel with the Duke of Rutland, which disputes, 
by the by, seem to subside, and vanish into nothing. 
The French packet is not yet arrived. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Caraman and Captain Grandchain 
beg leave to offer their respects to you, Mrs. Washington, and all the family. My most tender, affectionate respects wait upon Mrs. Washington and all 
the family. I beg she will give a kiss for me to 
the little girls, my friend ; and I beg Mrs. 
</p><p>
Stuart, the Doctor, Mr. Lund Washington, and all our 
friends, to receive my best compliments. I hope <a href='/results.php?tla=beh' rel=''>Mr. Harrison</a> will be soon appointed, and I wish his cousin may know it. 
</p><p>
Adieu, adieu, my dear General. It is with inexpressible pain that I feel I am going to be severed 
from you by the Atlantic. Every thing, that admiration, respect, gratitude, friendship, and filial love, can 
inspire, is combined in my affectionate heart to devote me most tenderly to you. In your friendship I 
find a delight which words cannot express. Adieu, 
my dear General. It is not without emotion that I 
write this word, although I know I shall soon visit 
you again. Be attentive to your health. Let me 
hear from you every month. Adieu, adieu.
