Sir, 
</p><p>
I need not observe to your Excellency, that respect for the opinion of Congress will not permit me 
to be indifferent to the impressions they may receive 
of my conduct. On this principle, though I do not 
think the subject of the inclosed letter of sufficient 
importance to request an official communication of it. 
yet I should be happy it might in some way be 
known to the members of that honorable body. 
</p><p>
Should they hereafter learn that, though retained on the list of their officers, I am not in the execution of 
the duties of my station, I wish them to be sensible that it is not a diminution of zeal which induces me 
voluntarily to withdraw my services, but that I only refrain from intruding them, when circumstances seem 
to have made them either not necessary or not desired, and that I shall not receive emoluments without performing the conditions to which they were 
annexed. I also wish them to be apprised upon what 
footing my future continuance in the army is placed, 
that they may judge how far it is expedient to permit it. I therefore take the liberty to request the 
favor of your Excellency to impart the knowledge of 
my situation in such manner as you think most convenient. I have the honor to be, with perfect respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant,
