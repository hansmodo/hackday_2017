SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your two favors of the 8th instant ; 
have also received, per Bacon, the remittance for the 
expenses of the French gentlemen to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
I had no design to have ever called on you for the 
money paid our troops under your immediate command, but to have accounted with the Congress, had 
we not been unexpectedly drained of cash, and had 
pressing calls upon us two or three ways at once. 
That to the northward could not possibly have been 
answered, but for the seasonable arrival of the continental supply, just sufficient for that purpose. Our 
other demands for the common service are many. 
The men, for the short service with you, could not have inarched without some money, which they have, 
I trust, wholly expended for necessary clothing, &c. 
I therefore could have wished it had been in your 
power to have remitted the sum advanced by our 
Pay-Table, but shall do every thing in my power, that 
the common interest do not suffer. 
</p><p>
I am greatly concerned for the scarcity of powder 
and arms. We have not half a sufficiency for our 
selves, as the circumstances may be ; yet, anxious to 
furnish you, for the common good, with every supply 
in our power, have ordered a quantity of gunpowder 
lately arrived at Bedford, in Dartmouth, carted to and 
now lying at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, on account of this Colony, 
to be sent you, with all possible expedition. Three 
thousand weight of this we conclude to order to Major Thompson, Agent .for the Massachusetts Colony, 
on account of money he supplied to Mr. Shaw, the 
importer, for that end, and you will consult him or 
them concerning the use of it. I suppose the whole 
to be upwards of six thousand weight ; the residue, 
on account of this Colony, for which shall expect 
payment, or to be replaced, as shall be hereafter 
chosen by us. I shall send you this week twenty or 
thirty stands of good arms. I have not certain ad 
vice from every quarter, but I believe our three 
regiments are all on the march to your camp, except 
those already arrived there. 
</p><p>
I have much more agreeable intelligence from General Lee, and the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> Congress, than I expected. I cannot but hope propitious Heaven will 
smile success on that most timely and judicious exertion of your Excellency, to prevent our enemies possessing themselves of that important station. I 
have the pleasure to inclose you a copy of General Lee's letter. In compliance with his request, we have already sent orders to Colonel Ward to repair again 
forthwith to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with the greatest esteem and regard, 
your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
