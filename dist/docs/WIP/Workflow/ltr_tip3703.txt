Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> has called on me to-day, respecting 
a provision of horses for the light artillery. I have 
authorized Colonel Hughes to purchase one hundred 
for thai service onli/, and promised payment by the 
1st of November. He writes me, encouragingly, that 
many may be so procured. The essential service to 
which they are to be applied will, I trust, facilitate 
a grant of money to enable me to fulfil my promise, 
which no ordinary calls would have induced me to 
hazard. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing of the horses expected from 
Pennsylvania since Colonel Mills wrote me, on the 29th ultimo, that, " on that and the following days, 
he should send money to all the counties where any 
horses remained, to enable the drivers to defray their 
expenses to the army." I desired they might he 
shod before they left the State. This may have 
retarded their progress a few days. I think they 
cannot now be far off. I expect they amount to a 
hundred ; but the numbers given me on paper have 
so often deceived me, I will not undertake to say 
how many will arrive. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> demands one 
hundred for the light artillery, which he is impatient 
to ])ring into the field. There is no practicable way 
of procuring them with despatch, but by an impress. 
In this part of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> there are few or no horses 
worth impressing. The other parts of this State have 
been harassed by impresses during the whole winter. 
Jersey has suffered in this way very little, nor am I 
informed of its having made any material effort either 
in furnishing supplies or services, since the last campaign. If one hundred horses were impressed there 
on this occasion, they might probably be relieved by 
those from Pennsylvania and Colonel Hughes's purchases, in the course of a fortnight or three weeks. 
</p><p>
As the enemy's shipping have gone down the 
river, I request your Excellency's determination whether a ferry-boat or two, capable of carrying horses, 
and some of Major Darby's bateaux, should not be 
brought down to Dobbs's Ferry; whether, if the 
Jersey troops continue on the other side, the transportation of stores from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> may 
not be turned thither; and whether the route of the 
expresses from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> may not be shortened in 
the same way. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to add, on the subject of an impress 
of horses, that, if your Excellency should judge it 
expedient to adopt the measure, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Dearborn will cross the river, consult Colonel Dayton, and fix on the proper persons to make the impress, aided by small detachments from the Jersey 
line. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect; 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
