Sir, 
</p><p>
IN pursuance of our Excellency's instructions to 
me, dated the 7th ultimo, I proceeded to the States 
of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New 
Hampshire, and delivered the despatches, with which 
I was charged, to the Governors and to the President, to whom they were addressed. 
</p><p>
The Legislatures of Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
unfortunately, were not sitting. The Governor of the 
former State, by having the powers of the Assembly 
in its recess, respecting the exigencies of the war, delegated to him, jointly with a certain Council, supposed 
that it would be unnecessary to call the Legislature 
on the matter of my mission, and that his Council 
would be competent to do every thing necessary on 
the occasion; for which purpose he proposed to call 
them together the next day after I had the honor 
of conversing with him, which was on the 11th ultimo. <a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague met'>Governor Trumbull</a> fully coincided in sentiment 
with me, in respect to the gratuity of the three half Johannes, in preference to any pay in paper money, 
as a matter that would be more efficacious to quiet 
the minds of the troops, and render them happy; 
and also as a measure which the New England States 
could execute with as much ease, under present circumstances, as the three months' real pay in paper. 
He was clearly of opinion, that to attempt to obtain 
both the gratuity and three months' pay, would be 
to attempt more than could be performed consistently 
with their present exertions in order to put their 
finances on a tolerable footing. The Governor pledged 
himself to exert his utmost interest to have the gratuity and deficiency of clothing given to the troops 
immediately; and requested me to impress on the 
Governors and official gentlemen in the other States, 
the necessity and propriety of New England adopting similar measures. I believe the Governor religiously performed his part, and I am happy to believe I did not fail in mine. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a> I saw His Grace the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague met'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, 
who pressed me to write an account of the revolt of 
the Pennsylvania line to the General, <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. This I intended to have done when I 
should have reached <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, as a matter which I 
presumed would be agreeable to your Excellency's 
sentiments. It was only anticipating it a few hours. 
Therefore, in conformity to the Duke's solicitations, I 
wrote to His Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>General Rochambeau</a> the 
letter marked number One. 
</p><p>
Governor Greene, of Rhode Island, immediately 
called the Legislature of that State to meet him 
at Greenwich the 18th ultimo. 
</p><p>
I was more happy, in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, to find the Assemblies of those States 
convened. To them I represented, in the strongest 
terms I was capable, the distresses of the army in 
general; of the troops of their lines in particular; 
and of the probable means that would conciliate the 
affections of the soldiers, and make them quiet and 
happy. I take the liberty to annex, in paper number two, a summary of the arguments which I urged 
to these Assemblies, as far as they applied to their 
troops ; and these were the principal arguments which 
I urged to the States respectively. 
</p><p>
Massachusetts were pleased to adopt the measures 
proposed, as appears by their acts, contained in the 
paper number Three. New Hampshire also adopted 
the measures, as far as the circumstances of their 
troops required. That is, they agreed immediately to 
grant a gratuity of twenty-four silver dollars per man 
to their soldiers enlisted for the war, and coats sufficient to complete their line. The State of Rhode 
Island thought proper to adopt a different mode, as 
appears by a copy of their proceedings, hereunto annexed, number Four, and certified by the Secretary 
of that State. But I hope, as their quantity of hard 
money will be as much as that of the other States, 
the effects will be equally good. The Council of Connecticut determined upon nothing final, but appeared 
to intend to follow the example of Massachusetts. 
They were to meet at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a> the 5th instant, on 
this business. The Governor informed me he had 
but little doubt that they would adopt similar measures to Massachusetts. But, if they should decline, 
he would immediately call the Legislature, when he 
presumed the matter would be made certain. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to assure your Excellency, that 
all ranks of people, as well unofficial as official, from 
the private farmer up to the Governor, in the four 
States through which I passed, appear perfectly well 
principled in the contest, and fully determined to 
make every sacrifice of property and personal ease 
to insure the happy termination of the war. The 
universal sentiment was, that the army ought to be 
supported, and should be supported at every reasonable expense. 
</p><p>
The business of obtaining recruits for their battalions proceeds with great vigor and spirit, â€” for three 
years only, indeed; but the prejudice or sentiments 
of the recruits, who generally are the farmers' sons 
of the country, are against engaging for an indefinite 
term of time. I believe it would be easier to engage recruits from New England for seven years, than for 
the undefined term, for the ivar. 
</p><p>
I hope I have executed this business agreeably to your Excellency's ideas and if so, a line of approbation would render happy, yours, &c., 
</p><p>
