Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the pamphlet you was so obliging 
as to send me. It does not appear probable to me that 
Europe is very speedily to be blessed with a general and 
lasting peace, or that the period has already arrived when 
reason and virtue will govern the conduct of the mass of 
mankind. There is much reason to believe that the majority of men are neither reasonable nor virtuous ; and hence 
it has happened, that so many systems which were calculated on the supposed prevalence of reason and virtue, have 
proved delusive. 
</p><p>
The time, doubtless, will come, and is approaching, when 
a new order of things will be introduced, and when, as the 
human passions and vices cease to predominate, the checks 
necessary to control them will become proportionably less 
necessary. To see things as being what they are, to estimate then i accurately, and to act accordingly, are requisites 
no less essential to sound politics than to sound philosophy 
or religion. 
</p><p>
These are general remarks, and not made with reference 
to the political questions agitating in this kingdom, and with 
which (being a citizen of another country) it would not 
become me to interfere. With the best wishes for your 
health and happiness, I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
