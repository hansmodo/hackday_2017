Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Temple presented to me this morning the commission which I have now the honour of transmitting to your 
excellency herewith enclosed. It appoints him consulgeneral of his Britannic majesty, throughout the United 
States of America. 
</p><p>
Two questions arise on this occasion : 
</p><p>
1. Whether he is to be received de jure. 
</p><p>
2. Whether it will be expedient to receive him de gratia. 
The first question is settled by Vattel in the following 
</p><p>
paragraph, viz., 
</p><p>
"Among the modern institutions," &c, page 131. 
</p><p>
The second question appears to me to be an important 
one, for however determined, interesting consequences will 
result from its decision. In considering it, a secondary 
question presents itself, viz. whether the rejection or reception of this consul will most dispose his nation to the terms 
of commercial intercourse which we wish. To this point, 
the fable of the north wind and the sun seems applicable. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the admission of a consul here is 
not a matter of so much importance to Britain, as to induce 
that nation to purchase or obtain it by any compliances 
which they would not olherivisc make. Severity, or summum jus on small points, may irritate, but they very 
seldom coerce. Retaliatory restrictions on trade and navigation are great objects, and very consistent with the pride 
and dignity, as well as interest of a nation ; but under such 
ideas to refuse to receive a consul, would, whatever might 
be the true motives, be generally ascribed to a degree of 
pique and irritation, which, though nations may feel, they 
ought not expressly or impliedly to declare. 
</p><p>
In my opinion, therefore, this consul ought to be received, but in such a manner as to be and to appear as a matter 
of favour, and not ns a matter of course. 
I have the honour to be, 
</p><p>
Your excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
And very humble servant, 
</p><p>
