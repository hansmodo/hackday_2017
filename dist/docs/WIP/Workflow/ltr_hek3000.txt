MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, and made preparation to go over the Lake this morning, but <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> reaching here before day, prevents my going over for 
an hour or two. He has given me a list of stores on the other side, from which I am enabled to send an inventory of those which I intend to forward to camp. 
The garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> is so weak, the conveyance from the fort to the landing is so difficult, the 
passage across the Lake so precarious, that I am afraid it will be ten days, at least, before I can get them on this side. When they are here, the conveyance from hence will depend entirely on the sledding ; if that is good, they shall immediately move forward; without sledding, the roads are so much gullied, that it will be impossible to move a step. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> will do every thing possible to forward this business. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hek" rel="me">HENRY KNOX</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> assures me, that although the navigation through Lake George should be stopped, yet, if there is any sledding, they shall move on another way.
