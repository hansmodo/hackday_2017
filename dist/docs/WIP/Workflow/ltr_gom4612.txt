Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the first instant. On the 
seventeenth of the last month I mentioned the plans then in 
contemplation, and gave a short view of the existent state of 
things. I did not communicate those events, which have since 
taken place, because you will find the most ample details in 
the several Gazettes. 
</p><p>
On Saturday, the seventh, a farce was acted in the Assembly, in which the principal performers played well their parts, 
and the King was duped according to custom. Things are 
now verging fast to the catastrophe of the play. For some 
weeks, the adverse parties, I mean the court and Jacobins, 
have been laboring, each to cast on the other the odium of violating entirely the constitution, and commencing the civil war. 
The party which calls itself independent, and which in fact is 
the fearful party, begs hard for peace, and seizes eagerly what 
ever bears the appearance or the name. It was to catch these 
gudgeons that the scene of Saturday was exhibited. 
</p><p>
The King and Queen, believing that the actors were in ear 
nest, and knowing that their lives had been at stake, were over 
joyed ; and their timid counsellors, trembling under the tyrannous powers of the Assembly, seized with eagerness the bait of 
reconciliation, which had been thrown out without any hope 
that they would swallow it. One of them, whom I have already mentioned to you as a very worthy man, saw through the 
thin veil of deception, and opposed the opinion of the others, 
but in vain. Events in justifying him have fixed his predominance. This day the King will commence a new career, and 
if he goes through, I think he will succeed. I have every reason to believe that this letter will go safely, but yet I cannot 
justify saying more on the subject, because otherwise the confidence reposed in me might in the course of events prove fatal to my informant. 
</p><p>
The present intention of the King is to secure the liberty of 
France ; but whether he will preserve the steady purpose 
through those varying events, which must soon take place, to 
me appears uncertain. Indeed, I doubt whether he will be 
sufficiently master of his own party to execute such purpose, 
even if it be not changed. Whether he will live through the 
storm is also uncertain. It will blow hard. 
</p><p>
The exterior enemy hovers over his prey, and only seems 
to wait the moment which he has fixed to himself for his own 
stroke. New parties to the grand alliance daily show them 
selves. The Palatinate has declared ; Holland seems on the 
point of adhering ; and doubts in regard to England begin to 
appear. The force, which France can oppose to her numerous assailants, does not exceed one hundred and eighty thou 
sand undisciplined men ; some of whom wait but the opportunity to desert. Against her, are collected two hundred and 
fifty thousand of the best troops in Europe, under the command of the ablest General in this hemisphere. The intention 
was not to enter before the harvest, in order that subsistence 
might be easily procured. Whether this plan will be changed 
in consequence of what is like to happen here, I cannot say. 
I rather think it will. I understand that the manifesto, which 
precedes attack, will disavow the constitution, and claim for 
the King (what it calls) his rights; for the clergy, their posses 
sions. That this city will be rendered responsible for the royal 
family. That the Gardes Rationales will be considered as armed peasants, meddling with business not their own, and there 
fore not under the protection of the laws of war. The allied 
monarchs are to declare themselves in arms, not against France, 
but against the revoltes. You will easily see that these broad 
terms will mean whatever power may choose to explain them 
to mean. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly pressed the minister of Foreign Affairs 
to come to a settlement of accounts, which he has promised 
to do, and I think I shall accomplish my purpose, because 
the Marine department is to treat with me for supplies to St 
Domingo. I mean to be generous in the terms of exchange 
for this supply, obtaining at the same time a beneficial liquidation of past payments ; for you will observe, Sir, that the 
whole account is open. Two reasons operate with me on 
this occasion. First, I think that we ought to encourage our 
own argriculture and arts ; and secondly, I think what is paid 
here goes into a gulph of unbottomed profusion, and can but 
little advance the real interests of the nation. 
I have also repeatedly called the minister's attention to the 
obnoxious acts of the late Assembly, and to their proposition 
of a new commercial treaty. He has replied very candidly, that 
for himself he should be glad to settle everything to my satis 
faction, but that his ministerial existence is too precarious to 
undertake any extensive plan ; that the attention of government is turned too strongly towards itself, in the present moment, to think of its exterior interests ; and that the Assembly, 
at open war with the executive, would certainly reject whatever should now be presented to them. These are truths which 
I knew before, and therefore I thought it best not to urge too 
strongly for a decision, in the unpropitious moment. The ap 
parent reconciliation of Saturday seemed to give a better prospect. The court on Sunday had an air less embarrassed, and 
therefore, although the dictate of my judgment was different 
from that of others, I thought it my duty to make a formal ap 
plication, which I did yesterday in a letter, a copy of which 
shall be transmitted. My intelligence of this morning justifies 
the opinion I had formed, and proves that the matter must be 
yet for some time suspended. I am, &c.
