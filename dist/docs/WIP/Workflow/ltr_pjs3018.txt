DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At half after ten, this morning, I received a letter 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a>, copy whereof I inclose your Excellency. 
</p><p>
As it is most probable the enemy are attempting 
to cross the Lake, I have therefore thought it necessary to apply to the neighbouring counties of the New 
England States, and those of Ulster and Duchess in 
this, to order their militia to march up. As soon 
as they arrive, I shall either move with what part 
may go to the northward, or with those to the west 
ward, as may be most necessary. This can, however, 
only be determined by farther intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'><a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a></a> and Colonel Dayton, which I momently 
expect to receive. 
</p><p>
The cartridge-paper arrived here on the 2d instant, was sent forward on the 3d, and arrived at Fort 
George on the 5th, at night, and was probably for 
warded from thence on the 6th. 
</p><p>
I am informed that the army is in the greatest 
distress for medicines. As every misfortune and want 
they labor under is imputed to me, so is this. I am 
heartily tired of abuse, and was in hopes that congress would have ordered an inquiry into my conduct. I requested it, most earnestly, on the 16th of 
last month, but have not yet been honored with an 
answer. I will no longer suffer the public odium, 
since I have it most amply in my power to justify 
myself, and shall therefore resign my commission as 
soon as I return from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, or Try on county. 
Of this I shall advise Congress, that orders may be 
given for a General Officer to reside in this place, 
without which the service will suffer. But, in doing 
this, I shall never forget the duty I owe to my country ; and if I can, by advice or any other means, promote the weal of it, none will do it with more ala 
crity. I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem 
and respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
