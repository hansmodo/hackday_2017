MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is Monday, the time to expect the eastern mail. 
Other men have letters, I have none. Humiliated 
and mortified, and, at the same time, irritated, I feel 
sometimes a disposition to abuse the post offices, 
sometimes to make a rash vow never to spend an 
other winter separated from my small family that re 
mains to me, but never once harbor a suspicion that 
madame may have omitted to write. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, however, my health and spirits 
have been better this winter than at any time since I 
had the ague, a blessing which I attribute to the free 
use of my horse the last summer. Health, and spirits, 
and leisure, have revived my old passion for reading 
to such a degree as, diverting me from my usual exercise of walking when I cannot ride, alarms me for 
the continuance of my health. A gloomy prospect, 
moreover, of four months longer attendance upon 
Congress, aggravated by the recollection that a few 
days later than this the last year, on the 19th of February, I got my release and liberty, makes a great defalcation from my philosophical serenity. While we are 
informed that you have plenty of snow and fine sled 
ding and sleighing, we have weather as mild as April, 
arid streets as dirty as March. 
</p><p>
No further news of the treaty, or any thing else, 
from Europe. Business in Congress as languid, as 
gaping and yawning as if Morpheus had poured out 
all his soporifics upon the two houses. The voice of 
faction, even, is scarcely heard. I suppose, however, 
when the treaty comes, he will lift up his notes like a 
trumpet. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel=''>General Wayne</a> has returned and enjoyed 
his triumph. Judge Chase is here with the rest. Mr. Lee, the Attorney General, a brother of our friend 
the late member of the House and the late Governor 
of Virginia, married to a daughter of Richard Henry 
Lee, is arrived with his family. So is Mr. Me Henry, 
the Secretary at War. The offices are once more 
full. But how differently filled than when Jefferson, 
Hamilton, Jay, &c., were here ! The present incumbents not being much thought of, or at least talked 
of, for President, Vice President, or substitute for 
both, the public may be less disposed to fight for them 
or against them. The first situation is the great object of contention, the centre and main source of all 
emulation, as the learned Dr. Adams teaches in all 
his writings, and every body believes him, though no 
body will own it. 
My letters to you must never be seen by any body 
else. And I ought here to caution you to be very 
careful and reserved in showing our son's letters, for 
thousands are watching for his halting, as well as 
mine and yours. Mrs. Green, with her two daugh 
ters, is here, and mourns, in pathetic accents, that her 
friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel='spouse met friend'>Mrs. Adams</a>, is not here, and so does
