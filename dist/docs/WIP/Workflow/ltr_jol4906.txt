My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
In our present camp form'd of two commanding 
hills, whose front and flanks bid defiance to assailants, 
additionally secured by a very strong advanced post, 
and well supplied with every necessary, we wait the 
arrival of reinforcements from the north, a part of 
which is on its march and will soon arrive. What we 
are to do when reinforced depends upon circumstances. 
</p><p>
If our forts hold out and we do our duty, Gen'l Howe will find himself in a situation which will re 
quire the utmost exertions of military talents to bring 
him off with honor. He has already experienced 
some difficulty in subsisting his troops and Tory 
adherents; perhaps he might have been reduced to the 
necessity of retreating, if there had been proper concert in the proceedings of our fleet and garrison. 
The enemy's boats pass and repass at night, carry sup 
plies from the shipping to the town, and meet with 
no interruption. The cannon of the fort cannot be 
brought to bear upon them; random firing would be a 
waste of precious ammunition. The galleys alone can 
be opposed to their passage, which has been hitherto 
effected between Province Island and Fort Minim, 
under cover of darkness. What this inactivity of the 
galleys is owing to is unknown ; some attribute it to 
the jealousy which commonly subsists between the 
officers of the naval and land service a vitious spirit 
which should not be known in Republics. However 
I have reason to believe that this communication will 
be cut off for the future. 
</p><p>
The Reinforcements for this army are arrived at 
Red-bank the intended addition has been made 
to the two garrisons, and the remainder will be 
posted in a proper situation for falling on the rear of 
any storming party, or annoying the enemy in any 
more formal attack 011 Red-bank. This morning a 
heavy cannonading was heard from below and continued till afternoon ; from the top of Chew's house 
in German Town to which place the General took a 
ride this morning, we could discover nothing more 
than thick clouds of smoke, and the masts of two 
vessels, the weather being very hazy.

This days <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> paper contains Gen Burgoyne's Letter to s'r W'm Howe : as I cannot send 
you the paper itself I copy the letter 
</p><p>
Copy of a Letter, brought by Lieut. Valancy of the 62d. 
</p><p>
ALBANY, Octob. 20th. 
</p><p>
Sir: 
</p><p>
In conformity to my orders to proceed by the most vigorous exertions to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I pass'd the 
Hudson's River at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> on the 13th September. 
</p><p>
No exertions have been left untried. The army under my command has fought twice against great 
superiority of numbers. The first action was on the 19th Septem. when after four hours sharp conflict, we remain'd masters of the field of battle. The 2d 
action (on the 7th October) was not so successful and ended with a storm upon two parts of our intrenchments, the one defended by Lieut. Col. Breyman who 
was kill'd upon the spot, and the post was lost, the other defended by Lord Balcarras at the head of the British Light Infantry who repulsed the enemy with 
great loss. The army afterwards made good their retreat to the heights of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, unable to proceed 
farther, the enemy having possession of all the fords and the passes on the east side of Hudson's River. 
The army waited the chances of events and offer'd themselves to the attack of the enemy till the 13th inst when only three days provision at short allowance remained. At that time the last hope of timely 
assistance being exhausted, my numbers reduced by past actions to three thousand five hundred fighting men, of which about nineteen hundred alone were 
British; invested by the enemys troops to the amount of sixteen thousand men ; I was induced by the general concurrence and advice of the General, Field officers and Captains commanding Corps, to 
open a Treaty with Major Gen'l Gates. Your Excellency will observe by the papers transmitted herewith, the disagreeable prospect that attended the first overtures, The army determined to die to a 
man, rather than submit to terms repugnant to national and personal honor. I trust you will think the Treaty inclosed consistent with both. 
</p><p>
I am with the greatest respect and attachment, 
</p><p>
Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
(Signed), J. BURGOYNE.
</p><p>
The first overtures alluded to in the above letter. 
</p><p>
1st. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>'s army being exceedingly 
reduced by repeated defeats, by desertion, sickness, 
&c., their provisions exhausted, their military stores, 
tents and baggage taken or destroyed, their retreat 
cut off and their camp invested, they can only be al 
lowed to surrender prisoners of war. 
</p><p>
Answer. Lieut. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>'s army, however 
reduced, will never admit that their retreat is cut 
off, while they have arms in their hands. 
</p><p>
2. The officers and soldiers may keep the baggage 
belonging to them. The generals of the United 
States never permit individuals to be pillaged. 
</p><p>
3. The troops under his excell'y <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a> will 
be conducted by the most convenient route to N". England, marching by easy marches, and sufficiently provided for by the way. 
</p><p>
4th. The officers will be admitted on parole, may 
wear their side arms, and will be treated with the 
liberality customary in Europe, so long as they by 
proper behaviour continue to deserve it ; but those 
who are apprehended having broke their parole (as some British officers have done) must expect to be closely confined. 
</p><p>
Answer. There being no officer in this army, under 
or capable of being under the description of breaking 
parole, this article needs no answer. 
</p><p>
5th. All public stores, artillery, arms, ammunition, carriages, horses, &ca., must be deliver'd to 
Commissaries appointed to recieve them. 
</p><p>
Answer. All public stores may be deliver'd arms excepted. 
</p><p>
6th. These terms being agreed to and sign d, the 
troops under His Excellys <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Burgoyne</a>s command 
may be drawn up in their encampment, where they 
will be order'd to ground their arms, and may be 
thereupon march'd to the river side, to be pass'd over 
in their way towards <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
</p><p>
Answer. This article is inadmissible in any extremity ; sooner than this army will consent to ground 
their arms in their encampment, they will rush on the 
enemy determined to take no quarter. 
</p><p>
October 14th, <a href='/results.php?year=1777' rel="origin">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
These overtures being rejected the present Convention took place. 
</p><p>
In this paper are continued the proclamations on 
promising 200 Acres of Land to each non commisioned 
officer, and 50 to each private who shall serve in the 
Provincial Corps now raising the other marking 
the 1st day of December next as the last term of 
pardon for deserters from His Majesty's services. 
The most remarkable advertisements are " Wanted 
immediately an additional number of able bodied men, 
to serve on the city nightly parole, those desirous of 
serving are to apply to J. Delaplane Constable of the 
watch. "Wanted, a number of hands to cut wood 
during the winter season, for the use of the army 
good encouragement will be given &ca. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, Germantown and 
the country about are desired to make a return of 
the number of horses, waggons, teams and carts in 
their possession. 
</p><p>
Those that choose to hire their waggons by the day, 
shall be paid the customary price and those who 
conceal their waggons, and do not make returns as 
above, will have them seized. 
</p><p>
KB. A number of men wanted to drive waggons 
their pay shall be three shillings N. York Currency 
and provisions found them." 
</p><p>
The day before yesterday, Mr Crouch and another 
gentleman pass'd thro camp in their way from the 
eastward to Charles Town. They said they intended 
to continue their journey early the next morning. I 
was out till late dinner time with the General, was 
busy after dinner, and consequently had but little time 
for private affairs however, I accomplished a letter 
to Mrs Laurens which I enclosed to Mr Gervais to be 
forwarded, giving him for his pains as much news as 
</p><p>
I could recollect and commit hastily to paper, and 
what will be a treasure to him as a Newsmonger, 
Humphrey's Gazette of the 25th . I expected to have 
been able to procure another for you, but have been 
disappointed. 
</p><p>
The light manner in which Count Donops affair is related. s'r W'm Howe's Kitean harangue to such 
he would delude into the loyal corps of which he has 
reserved to himself the Colonelcy and other little 
anecdotes, may make it acceptable even a day or 
two hence, if you have not already seen it, and in 
that time I may get it from some one whose curiosity 
and that of his circle is satisfied or called off to some 
thing more recent. 
</p><p>
A day or two ago, Capt. Lee of the light horse with 
twelve of his troops, dispersed a foraging party on 
the other side Schuylkill, took a Captain of the 
Queen's Rangers (this is the name given to the new 
levies of provincial troops), and seven privates, two of 
whom were marines. He gives us intelligence that 
Gen'l Howe's first Aid de Camp is embarked for 
England and that his principal business is to solicit 
speedy and large reinforcements. This will be 
delivered to you by a Baron Frey, who brought a 
letter of recommendation from Doctor Franklin to 
the General, and is carrying one to Mr Morris. He 
left France in August, at which time he says it was 
the- serious opinion of people in France that the Court 
of G. Britain had obtained 30,000 Russians. 
Between copying and composing I have inked a 
great deal of paper, and it begins to be time for me to 
join in the concert of my snoring companions, who 
are extended before the fire in the style which we 
practiced in the interior parts of So. Carolina. I 
wish you as sound sleep with the cares of state as I 
am likely to have, and continue in every circumstance and situation my dear father.

Your most dutiful
