MY DEAREST FRIE1YD, 
</p><p>
THE anxiety you express in your kind letter of 31st 
December, which I received this morning, for your 
country and the happiness of your children, is very 
amiable. The prospects of this country are gloomy, 
but the situation of all Europe is calamitous beyond 
all former examples. At what time, and in what 
manner, and by what means, the disasters which are 
come, and seem to be coming on mankind, may be 
averted, I know not. Our own people have been imprudent, as I think, and are now smarting under the 
effects of their indiscretion ; but this, instead of a 
consolation, is an aggravation of our misfortune. Mr. Genet has been abusive on the President and all his 
ministers, beyond all measure of decency or obligations of truth, and in other respects not yet publicly 
investigated, his conduct has been such as to make it 
difficult to know what to do with him. But I cannot 
explain myself fully. You must wait for time to bring 
forth events and eclair cissements.

Mrs. Washington always inquires affectionately 
after your health, and I never forget to present your 
respects.

The news of this evening is, that the Queen of 
France is no more. When will savages be satiated 
with blood ? No prospect of peace in Europe, and 
therefore none of internal harmony in America. We 
cannot well be in a more disagreeable situation than 
we are with all Europe, with all Indians, and with all 
Barbary rovers. Nearly one half the continent is in 
constant opposition to the other, and the President's 
situation, which is highly responsible, is very distress 
ing. He made me a very friendly visit yesterday, 
which I returned to-day, and had two hours conversation with him alone in his cabinet. The conversation, 
which was extremely interesting, and equally affectionate, I cannot explain even by a hint. But his earnest 
desire to do right and his close application to discover 
it, his deliberate and comprehensive view of our affairs 
with all the world, appeared in a very amiable and 
respectable light. The anti-federalists and the frenchified zealots have nothing now to do that I can conceive of, bat to ruin his character, destroy his peace, 
and injure his health. He supports all their attacks 
with great firmness, and his health appears to be very 
good. The Jacobins would make a sortie upon him 
in all the force they could muster, if they dared. 
I run on and say nothing, so I will conclude. 
Your ever affectionate 
</p><p>
