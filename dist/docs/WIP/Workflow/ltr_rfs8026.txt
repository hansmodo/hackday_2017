SIR : In answer to your note received this afternoon, I need say but little more than that which I communicated to you in a conversation at San Diego : that California was conquered, and a civil 
government put into successful operation ; that a copy of the laws made by me for the government of the territory, and the names of 
the officers selected to see them faithfully executed, were transmitted to the President of the United States before you arrived in the territory. 
</p><p>
I will only add, that I cannot do any thing nor desist from doing any thing on your demand, which I will submit to the President and ask for your recall. In the mean time you will consider yourself 
suspended from the command of the United States forces in this place. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, 
</p><p>
Commander-in- Chief. 
</p><p>
To BREVET BRIGADIER- GENERAL, S. W. KEARNEY.
