My dear General, 
</p><p>
As <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague'>General Knox</a>, who well knows the state of 
our affairs here, will be with your Excellency as early as this can reach you, I may omit many matters 
which otherwise I should think it my duty to mention. 
</p><p>
I am informed that Congress have acceded to a 
general exchange, and that it is left with your Excellency to carry it into effect, at such time as you 
shall think proper. I know too well your Excellency's feelings for the distresses of those of our people 
in captivity, not to be convinced that the first proper 
moment will be seized to execute a measure which 
will so effectually promote the happiness of many, 
who, it appears to me, have deserved every attention 
from their country. 
</p><p>
The inclosed is a list of a number of good men 
(not in the line of the army), who, before I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, solicited my interest in procuring their 
exchange. I wish, when an exchange shall take place, 
that these persons may be subjects of it. I have no 
doubt but there are many other citizens who wish to 
be exchanged. If their names can be obtained, I hope 
they will enjoy the same benefit. I am, my dear 
General, with the greatest esteem, 
</p><p>
Tour Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
