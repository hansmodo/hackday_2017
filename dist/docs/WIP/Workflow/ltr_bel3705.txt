My dear General, 
</p><p>
I was yesterday honored with your Excellency's 
favor of the 26th ultimo, covering a letter from Sir 
Henry Clinton to me. I cannot but hope you have 
a little misapprehended him, and that it was not his 
intention to make my exchange depend absolutely on 
the exchange of the southern army. Did I fully believe this to be his meaning, I should suppose no 
advantages would result from my meeting Major-General Phillips, while there are any reasons existing in your Excellency's mind, which would make it 
improper, at this time, to go into a general exchange ; 
but, as I flatter myself he meant only to involve in 
my exchange that of General Phillips and General Riedesel, I think my meeting General Phillips will 
accelerate my exchange. I therefore will do myself 
the pleasure of waiting on your Excellency, on the 
10th of September, and hope then to have the honor 
of your instructions on the business I may have to 
transact. 
</p><p>
I propose to meet General Phillips at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, on the 12th of next month. If your Excellency's permission is necessary, for him to meet me at 
that place, I wish it might be sent to him. I have 
inclosed my letter to General Clinton, under a flying 
seal, which, if agreeable to your Excellency, I wish 
to have forwarded. I have the honor to be, my dear 
General, with the highest respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
