MY DEAR JANET: 
</p><p>
This morning the Bostonians have marched into town ; the Governor, with his small garrison, having abandoned it two nights since, and retired towards <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, where lie will run 
some risk of being caught by <a href="/results.php?tla=bea" rel="colleague met">Col. Arnold</a>, who is arrived in that neighborhood. 
</p><p>
I am summoning all my virtue against the legion of females soliciting for husbands, brothers and sons taken prisoners. 
</p><p>
You may depend upon it, I will return home the instant I have put matter on such a footing as to be able to retire with 
propriety. I am very well, and very anxious to see you. Farewell, my dear Janet. 
</p><p>
Believe me yours, with real affection. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=rim" rel="me">RICHARD MONTGOMERY</a>.
