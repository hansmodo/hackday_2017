MY DEAR LUCY, 
</p><p>
I hope you have before now received my letter, 
which was ordered on board with Captain Lyde, 
but put on board another vessel, because it was said 
she would sail first. By that you will see that I did 
not wait to receive a letter from you first. I thank 
you for yours of November 6th, which reached me 
last evening ; and here I am, seated by your cousin J. Q. A.'s fireside, where, by his invitation, I usually write. 
</p><p>
And in the first place, my dear Lucy, shall I find 
a little fault with you ? A fault, from which neither 
your good sister, nor cousin Abby, is free. It is 
that all of you so much neglect your handwriting. 
I know that a sentiment is equally wise and just, 
written in a good or bad hand ; but then there 
is certainly a more pleasing appearance, when the 
lines are regular, and the letters distinct and well 
cut. A sensible woman is so, whether she be handsome or ugly ; but who looks not with most pleasure 
upon the sensible beauty ? " Why, my dear aunt," 
methinks I hear you say, " only look at your own 
handwriting." Acknowledged ; I am very sensible 
of it, and it is from feeling the disadvantages of it 
myself, that I am the more solicitous that my young 
acquaintance should excel me, whilst they have 
leisure, and their fingers are young and flexible. 
Your cousin, J. Q. A., copied a letter for me the 
other day, and, upon my word, I thought there was 
some value in it, from the new appearance it acquired. 
</p><p>
I have written several times largely to your sister, 
and, as I know you participate with her, I have not 
been so particular in scribbling to every one of the 
family ; for an imagination must be more inventive 
than mine, to suppy materials with sufficient variety 
to afford you all entertainment. Through want of a 
better subject, I will relate to you a custom of this 
country. You must know that the religion of this 
country requires abundance of feasting and fasting, 
and each person has his particular saint, as well as 
each calling and occupation. To-morrow is to be 
celebrated, le jour des rois- The day before this 
feast it is customary to make a large paste pie, into 
which one bean is put. Each person at table cuts 
his slice, and the one who is so lucky as to obtain the 
bean, is clubbed king or queen. Accordingly, to-day, 
when I went in to dinner, I found one upon our table. 
</p><p>
Your cousin Abby began by taking the first slice ; 
but alas ! poor girl, no bean, and no queen. In the 
next place, your cousin John seconded her by taking 
a larger cut, and as cautious as cousin T when he inspects merchandise, bisected his paste with 
mathematical circumspection ; but to him it pertained 
not. By this time, I was ready for my part ; but first 
I declared that I had no cravings for royalty. I accordingly separated my piece with much firmness, 
nowise disappointed that it fell not to me. Your 
uncle, who was all this time picking his chicken bone, 
saw us divert ourselves without saying any thing ; 
but presently he seized the remaining half, and to 
crumbs went the poor paste, cut here and slash there ; 
when, behold the bean ! " And thus," said he, " are 
kingdoms obtained ; " but the servant, who stood by 
and saw the havoc, declared solemnly that he could 
not retain the title, as the laws decreed it to chance, 
and not to force. 
</p><p>
How is Gene ml Warren's family ? Well, I hope, 
or I should have heard of it. I am sorry Mrs. Warren 
is so scrupulous about writing to me. I forwarded a 
long letter to her some time since. Where is Miss 
Nancy <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> ? Well, 1 hope. We often laugh at 
your cousin John about her. He says her stature 
would be a great recommendation to him, as he is 
determined never to marry a tali woman, lest her 
height should give her a superiority over him. He 
is generally thought older than your cousin Abby ; 
and partly, I believe, because his company is with 
those much older than himself. 
</p><p>
As to the Germantown family, my soul is grieved 
for them. Many are the afflictions of the righteous. 
Would to Heaven that the clouds would disperse, 
and give them a brighter day. My best respects to 
them. Let Mrs. Field know, that Esther is quite 
recovered, and as gay as a lark. She went to Paris 
the other day with Pauline, to see a play, which is 
called " Figaro." It is a piece much celebrated, 
and has had sixty-eight representations ; and every 
thing was so new to her, that Pauline says, " Est is 
crazed." 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
