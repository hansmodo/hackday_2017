Dear General, 
</p><p>
My correspondence with one of the British Generals, and my denial of a correspondence with the 
other, may be perhaps misrepresented. I shall therefore give an account of what has passed, and hope 
your Excellency and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> will approve of 
my conduct. On the arrival of our detachment at 
<a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, three letters were brought by a flag, which 
I have the honor to inclose, and which, as Commander of the troops in this State, it became my duty to 
answer. The inclosed letters were successively sent in pursuit of General Phillips, who received them 
both with a degree of politeness that seemed to apologize for his unbecoming style. 
</p><p>
General Phillips being dead, of a fever, an officer was sent with a passport and letters from General Arnold. I requested the gentleman to come to my 
quarters; and having asked if General Phillips was dead, to which he answered in the negative, I made 
it a pretence not to receive a letter from General Arnold, which, being dated head-quarters, and directed 
to the Commanding Officer of the American troops, ought to come from the British General, chief in 
command. I did, however, observe, that should any other officer have written to me, I would have been happy to receive their letters. 
</p><p>
The next day the officer returned with the same passport and letter, and informed me that he was 
now at liberty to declare that Phillips was dead, and Arnold was Commander-in-chief of the British army 
in Virginia. The high station of General Arnold having obliged me to an explanation, the inclosed 
note was sent to the officer of the flag, and the American officer verbally assured him that, was I requested to put in writing a minute account of my 
motives, my regard for the British army was such that I would cheerfully comply with the demand. 
</p><p>
Last evening a flag of ours returned from Petersburg, who had been sent by General Nelson from 
the advanced corps he commands, and happened to be on his way while the British officer was at our 
pickets. Inclosed is the note written by General Arnold, in which he announces a determination of 
sending our officers and men to the West Indies. The British General cannot but perfectly know that 
I am not to treat of partial exchanges ; and that the fate of the Continental prisoners must be regulated 
by a superior authority to that with which I am invested. With the highest respect, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
