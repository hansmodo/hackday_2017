Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to inform your Excellency that 
I arrived here last night, and, had my health permitted, should have continued my journey until I could 
have had the honor to inform your Excellency, in 
person, of the success of my mission. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Villefranche will present this ; 
to him I beg leave to refer for such observations relative to the situation of certain places, as I have 
been able to make during my tour. I esteem myself 
very unfortunate that I could not succeed in the 
business with which I was charged, and am only 
consoled by the idea that your Excellency will believe that every thing which was in my power to do 
was done, to answer the wishes of your Excellency 
and of Congress. 
</p><p>
I arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'><a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a></a> on the 2d of August, from 
whence I sent Major North to announce my arrival 
to General Haldiniand. Inclosed is a copy of my 
letter, and his answer, which did not meet me till 
I had reached Dechambeau. According to General Haldimaud's appointment, we met at <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, on the 
8th, where I presented your Excellency's letter, and 
opened the business on which I was sent. To the 
first proposition which I had in charge to make. General Haldimand replied, that he had not received 
any orders for making the least arrangement for the 
evacuation of a single post ; that he had only received orders to cease hostilities; those he had strictly 
complied with, not only by restraining the British 
troops, but also the savages, from committing the 
least hostile act; but that, until he should receive 
positive orders for that purpose, he would not evacuate an inch of ground. 
</p><p>
I informed him that I was not instructed to insist on an immediate evacuation of the posts in question, 
but that I was ordered to demand a safe conduct to, and a liberty of visiting the posts on our frontiers, and now occupied by the British, that I might judge 
of the arrangements necessary to be made for securing the interests of the United States. To this he 
answered, that the precaution was premature ; that 
the peace was not yet signed; that he was only authorized to cease hostilities; and that, in this point 
of view, he could not permit that I should visit a 
single post occupied by the British. Neither would 
he agree that any kind of negotiation should take 
place between the United States and the Indians, if 
in his power to prevent it; and that the door of 
communication should, on his part, be shut, until he 
received positive orders from his Court to open it. 
</p><p>
My last proposal was, that he should enter into an 
agreement to advise Congress of the evacuation of 
the posts, three months previous to their abandonment. This, for the reason before mentioned, he refused, declaring that, until the definitive treaty should 
be signed, he would not enter into any kind of agreement or negotiation whatever. 
</p><p>
Although General Haldimand's answers to my demands were sufficiently clear not to be misunderstood, 
I requested his definitive answer in writing, a copy 
of which, together with a copy of my letter, is inclosed. Not having any thing to hope from a continuance of the negotiation, I left St. John's on the 
loth. In a few days, I hope to be able to inform 
your Excellency more minutely of every thing which 
passed between us. With the greatest respect, I have 
the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant,
