MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
When I wrote you last, I was just going to set out 
on a journey to the West of England. I promised 
you to visit Mr. Cranch's friends and relatives. 
This we did, as I shall relate to you. We were 
absent a month, and made a tour of about six hundred miles. The first place we made any stay at 
was Winchester. There was formerly an Earl of 
Winchester, by the name of Saer de <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. He 
was created Earl of Winchester by King John, in 
1224, and signed Magna Charta, which I have seen ; 
the original being now in the British Museum, with 
his handwriting to it. 
</p><p>
It is said, that, in the year 1321, the title became 
extinct through failure of male heirs, but I rather 
think through the poverty of some branch, unable 
to contend for it. The family originally came from 
Normandy, in the time of William the Conqueror. 
They bear the same arms with those of our ancestors, except that ours substituted an animal for the 
crest, in lieu of an earPs coronet. I have a perfect 
remembrance of a parchment in our grandmother's 
possession, which, when quite a child, I used to 
amuse myself with. This was a genealogical table, 
which gave the descent of the family from the time 
of William the Conqueror. This parchment Mr. 
Edmund <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> borrowed, on some occasion, and 
I have often heard our grandmother say, with some 
anger, that she could never recover it. As the old 
gentleman is still living, I wish Mr. Cranch would 
question him about it, and know what hands it went 
into, and whether there is any probability of its ever 
being recovered ; and be so good as to ask uncle 
<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> how our grandfather came by it, and from 
whence our great-grandfather came, where he first 
settled, and take down in writing all you can learn 
from him and Mr. Edmund <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> respecting the 
family. You will smile at my zeal, perhaps, on this 
occasion ; but can it be wondered at that I should 
wish to trace an ancestor amongst the signers of 
Magna Charta ? Amongst those who voted against 
receiving an explanatory charter in the Massachusetts, stands the name of our venerable grandfather, 
accompanied with only one other ; this the journals 
of the House will show, to his immortal honor. I 
do not expect either titles or estate from the recovery 
of the genealogical table, were there any probability 
of obtaining it. Yet, if I was in possession of it, 
money should not purchase it from me. 
</p><p>
But to return to Winchester. It is a very ancient 
place, and was formerly the residence of the Saxon 
and Norman kings. There still remains a very 
famous cathedral church, in the true Gothic architecture, being partly built in the year 1079. I attended divine service there, but was much more 
entertained with the venerable and majestic appearance of the ancient pile, than with the modern, 
flimsy discourse of the preacher. A meaner performance I do not recollect to have heard ; but, in a. 
church which would hold several thousands, it might 
truly be said, two or three were met together, and 
those appeared to be the lower order of the people. 
</p><p>
From Winchester we proceeded to Southampton, 
which is a very pretty seaport town, and much frequented during the summer months as a bathingplace ; and here, for the first time in my life, I 
tried the experiment. It would be delightful in 
our warm weather, as well as very salubrious, if 
such conveniences were erected in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a>, and Weymouth, which they might be, with little 
expense. The places are under cover. You have 
a woman for a guide, a small dressing-room to yourself, an oil-cloth cap, a flannel gown, and socks for 
the feet. We tarried only two days at Southampton, and went ten miles out of our way in order to 
visit Weymouth, merely for its name. This, like 
my native town, is a hilly country, a small seaport, 
with very little business, and wholly supported by 
the resort of company during the summer months. 
For those persons, who have not country-houses of 
their own, resort to the watering-places, as they are 
called, during the summer months, it being too vulgar and unfashionable to remain in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. But 
where the object of one is health, that of fifty is 
pleasure, however far they fall short of the object. 
This whole town is the property of a widow lady. 
Houses are built by the tenants, and taken at liferents, which, upon the decease of the lessees, revert 
back again to the owner of the soil. Thus is the 
landed property of this country vested in lordships 
and in the hands of the rich altogether. The peasantry are but slaves to the lord, notwithstanding 
the mighty boast they make of liberty. Sixpence 
and sevenpence per day is the usual wages given to 
laborers, who are to feed themselves out of the pittance. In travelling through a country, fertile as 
the garden of Eden, loaded with a golden harvest, 
plenty smiling on every side, one would imagine 
that the voice of Poverty was rarely heard, and that 
she was seldom seen, but in the abodes of indolence 
or vice. But it is far otherwise. The money earned 
by the sweat of the brow must go to feed the pampered lord and fatten the greedy bishop, whilst the 
miserable, shattered, thatched-roof cottage crumbles 
to the dust for want of repair. To hundreds and hundreds of these abodes have I been a witness in my late 
journey. The cheering rays of the sun are totally 
excluded, unless they rind admittance through the 
decayed roof, equally exposed to cold and the inclement season. A few rags for a bed and a jointstool comprise the chief of their furniture, whilst 
their own appearance is more wretched than one 
can well conceive. During the season of hay and 
harvest, men, women, and children are to be seen 
laboring in the fields : but, as this is a very small 
part of the year, the little they then acquire is soon 
expended ; and how they keep soul and body together the remainder of the year is very hard to tell. 
It must be owing to this very unequal distribution of 
property, that the poor-rate is become such an intolerable burden. The inhabitants are very thinly 
scattered through the country, though large towns 
are well peopled. To reside in and near <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, and 
to judge of the country from what one sees here, 
would be forming a very erroneous opinion. How 
little cause of complaint have the inhabitants of the 
United States, when they compare their situation, 
not with despotic monarchies, but with this land of 
freedom ! The ease with which honest industry 
may acquire property in America, the equal distribution of justice to the poor as well as the rich, 
and the personal liberty they enjoy, all. all call upon 
them to support their government and laws, to respect their rulers, and gratefully acknowledge their 
superior blessings, lest Heaven in wrath should send them a . 
</p><p>
From "W ev mouth, our next excursion was to Axminster, the first town in the county of Devonshire. 
It is a small place, but has two manufactures of 
note : one of carpets, and one of tapes ; both of 
which we visited. The manufactory of the carpets 
is wholly performed by women and children. You 
would have been surprised to see in how ordinary a 
building this rich manufactory was carried on. A 
few glass windows in some of our barns would be 
equal to it. They have but two prices for their 
carpets woven here ; the one is eighteen shillings, 
and the other twenty-four, a square yard. They 
are woven of any dimensions you please, and without a seam. The colors are most beautiful, and 
the carpets very durable. Here we found Mr. J. Cranch. He dined with us, and we drank tea with 
him. This is a curious genius. He is a middlesized man, of a delicate countenance, but quite 
awkward in his manners. He seldom looks one in 
the face, and seems as if he had been cramped and 
cowed in his youth. In company, one is pained for 
him ; yet he is a man of reading, and an accurate 
taste in the fine arts. Poetry, painting, music, 
sculpture, architecture, all of them have engaged 
his attention. His profession does not seem to be 
the object of his affections, and he has given up the 
practice, with an intention of pursuing some other 
employment. He appears to be a man whose soul 
wants a wider expansion than his situation and circumstances allow. Dejected spirits he is very liable 
to. I do not think him a happy man. His sentiments are by no means narrow or contracted ; yet 
he is one by himself. He accompanied us in our 
journey to Exeter, <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, and Kingsbridge. At 
Exeter, we tarried from Saturday till Monday afternoon. Mr. Bowring came to visit us. You know 
him by character. He appears a friendly, honest, 
worthy man, active in business, a warm and zealous 
friend to America, ready to serve his friends, and 
never happier than when they will give him an opportunity of doing it. His wife and daughter w T ere 
on a visit to their friends at Kingsbridge, so that w T e 
did not see them. He requested, however, that we 
would drink tea with him after meeting; and, as 
our intention was to see Mr. Cranch's brother Andrew, he engaged to get him to his house. The 
old gentleman came with some difficulty, for he is 
very lame and infirm. He seemed glad to see us, 
and asked many questions respecting his brother 
and sister in America. I think he must have had a 
paralytic stroke, as his speech is thick. He has not 
been able to do any business for a number of years, 
and I believe is chiefly supported by his son, who is 
in the clothier's business with Mr. Bowring. Mrs. 
Cranch, though nearly as old as her husband, is a 
little smart, sprightly, active woman, and is wilted 
just enough to last to perpetuity. She told me that 
her husband took it very hard, that his brother had 
not written to him for a long time. I promised her 
that he should hear from him before long ; and I 
know he will not let me be surety for him without 
fulfilling my engagement. Mr. Cranch's daughter 
married Mr. Bowring's brother ; they have three 
sons. She is a sprightly woman, like her mother. 
And Mr. Bowring's c'.au hter married a son of Mr. 
Nathaniel Cranch, so that the family is doubly 
linked together, and what is more, they all seem 
united by the strongest ties of family harmony and 
love. From Exeter, we went to <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> ; there we 
tarried several davs, and visited the fortifications and 
<a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> dock, and crossed over the water to Mount 
Edgcombe, a seat belonging to Lord Edgcombe. The 
natural advantages of this place are superior to any 
I have before seen, commanding a wide and extensive view of the ocean, the whole town of <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, 
and the adjacent country, with the mountains of 
Cornwall. I have not much to say with respect to 
the improvements of art. There is a large park, 
well stocked with deer, and some shady walks ; but 
there are no grottos, statuary, sculpture, or temples. 
At <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, we were visited by a Mr. and Mrs. 
Sawry, with whom we drank tea one afternoon. Mr. 
Sawry is well known to many Americans, who were 
prisoners in <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> jail during the late war. The 
money which was raised for their relief passed 
through his hands, and he was very kind to them, 
assisting many in their escape. From <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a>, 
we made an enterprise one day to Horsham, and, as 
we attempted it in a coach and four, we made a 
curious piece of work, taking by mistake a wrong 
road, bit this part of my story I must reserve for 
my dear Eliza. 
</p><p>
Our next movement was to Kingsbridge ; but, before I relate this, I ought to inform you that we 
made a stop at a place called Ivy Bridge, where we 
dined ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> accompanied Mr. Cranch to 
Brook, about three miles distant, to visit his uncle, 
Mr. William Cranch, who has been for several years 
quite lost to himself and friends. There is some 
little property in the hands of the family, who take 
charge of him, sufficient to support a person who 
has no more wants than he has. He appeared clean 
and comfortable, but took no notice, either of the conversation or persons. The only thing which in the 
least roused him was the mention of his wife. He 
appeared to be restless when that subject was touched. The character of this man, as given by all his 
friends and acquaintance, leads one to regret, in a 
particular manner, the loss of his intellect. Possessed 
of a genius superior to his station, a thirst for knowledge which his circumstances in life permitted him 
not to pursue, most amiable and engaging in his manners, formed to have adorned a superior rank in life, 
fondly attached to an amiable wife, whom he very 
soon lost, he fell a sacrifice to a too great sensibility ; 
unable to support the shock, he grew melancholy, 
and was totally lost. 
</p><p>
But to return to Kingsbridge, the chief resort of 
the Cranch family. We arrived at the inn about six 
o'clock on Saturday evening. About eight, we were 
saluted with a ringing of bells, a circumstance we 
little expected. Very soon we were visited by the 
various branches of the Cranch family, both male 
and female, amounting to fifteen persons ; but, as 
they made a strange jumble in my head, I persuaded 
my fellow traveller to make me out a genealogical 
table, which I send you. Mr. and Mrs. Burnell, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Trathan, both offered us beds and accommodations at their houses ; but we were too numerous to accept their kind invitations, though we 
eno-ao-ed ourselves to dine with Mr. Burnell, and to 
drink tea with Mr. Trathan, the next dav. Mrs. 
Burnell has a strong resemblance to Mrs. Palmer. 
She is a genteel woman, and easy and polite. We 
dined at a very pretty dinner, and after meeting 
drank tea at the other house, Mr. Trathan's. Their 
houses are very small, but every thing neat and 
comfortable. Mr. Burnell is a shoemaker, worth five 
thousand pounds ; and Mr. Trathan a grocer, in 
good circumstances. The rest of the families joined 
us at the two houses. They are all serious, industrious, good people, amongst whom the greatest family harmony appears to subsist. The people of this 
county appear more like our New England people 
than any I have met with in this country before ; 
but the distinction between tradesmen and gentry, as 
they are termed, is widely different from that distinction in our country. With us, in point of education and manners, the learned professions, and 
many merchants, farmers and tradesmen, are upon 
an equality with the gentry of this country. It 
would be degrading to compare them with many of 
the nobility here. As to the ladies of this country, 
their manners appear to be totally depraved. It is 
in the middle ranks of society, that virtue and morality are yet to be found. Nothing does more injury to the female character than frequenting public 
places ; and the rage which prevails now for the watering-places, and the increased number of them, are 
become a national evil, as they promote and encourage dissipation, mix all characters promiscuously, and 
are the resort of the most unprincipled female characters, who are not ashamed to show their faces 
wherever men dare to go. Modesty and diffidence 
are called ill-breeding and ignorance of the world ; 
an impudent stare is substituted in lieu of that modest deportment, and that retiring grace, which awes 
whilst it enchants. I have never seen a female 
model here of such unaffected, modest, and sweetly 
amiable manners as Mrs. Guild, Mrs. Russell, and 
many other American females exhibit.

Having filled eight pages, I think it is near time 
to hasten to a close. Cushiug and Folger are both 
arrived ; by each I have received letters from you. 
A new sheet of paper must contain a reply to them. 
This little space shall assure you of what is not 
confined to time or place, the ardent affection of 
your sister,
