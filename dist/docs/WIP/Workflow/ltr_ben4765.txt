DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is with great pleasure I understand by your favour of 
April loth, that you continue to enjoy so good a share of 
health. I hope it will long continue. And, although it may 
not now be suitable for you to make such wide excursions 
as heretofore, you may yet be very useful to your country 
and to mankind, if you sit down quietly at home, digest the 
knowledge you have acquired, and compile and publish the 
many observations you have made, and point out the advantages that may be drawn from the whole, in public undertakings or particular private practice. It is true, many people are fond of accounts of old buildings, and monuments; 
but there is a number, who would be much better pleased 
with such accounts as you could afford them. And, for one, 
I confess, that if I could find in any Italian travels a receipt 
for making Parmesan cheese, it would give me more satisfaction than a transcript of any inscription from any old stone 
whatever.

I suppose Mr. Michael Collinson, or Dr. Fothergill, has 
written to you what may be necessary for your information 
relating to your affairs here. I imagine there is no doubt 
but the King's bounty to you will be continued ; and that it 
will be proper for you to continue sending now and then a 
few such curious seeds, as you can procure, to keep up your 
claim. And now I mention seeds, I wish you would send me 
a few of such as are least common, to the value of a guinea, 
which Mr. Foxcroft will pay you for me. They are for a 
particular friend, who is very curious. If in any thing I can 
serve you here, command freely. Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
