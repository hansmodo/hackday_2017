I need not tell you, my dear General, what I felt 
on the critical arrival of Count de Grasse's squadron. 
Accept my warmest congratulations. The most decisive advantages may reasonably be expected from 
this generous and formidable cooperation. But I will not anticipate. The Financier has relieved my solicitude for the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> line. A month's pay, however inadequate to their claims, will raise their spirits ; at least, appease their discontent. 
</p><p>
I have this moment despatches from the northward, particularly from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>. The Indians have, within a few days, revisited Cobus Kill 
and Schoharie, burned several houses, and captivated 
some of the inhabitants ; and there is reason to be 
apprehensive that they will destroy the grain, which 
is doubtless their principal object, in this incursion. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> mentions that there are not less 
than eighty or ninety thousand bushels of wheat at 
Schoharie alone, which he has in vain essayed to 
bring away. 
</p><p>
Since your Excellency's departure, we have thrown 
the solitary remnant of our Marine into the management of our Financier. It will save a capital expense, 
as the Admiralty, Navy Boards, and their subordinate 
offices, are dissolved. When the number of our ships 
and the circumstances of our Treasury justify it, the 
appointment of the Minister of the Marine will be 
seasonable. The Board of the Treasury, and its dependents, will, in a few days, undergo a similar reform. I expect those measures will prove a fruitful 
source of invective against those who have introduced and pressed them ; and I am content to take 
my share. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to transmit this letter by Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleage met'>Colonel Laurens</a>. In the execution of his 
late mission, he has acquired great honor and given entire satisfaction. From having his report under 
consideration, as a member of a Special Committee, I had an opportunity of minute inquiry; and I am 
convinced he has done every thing which could be expected, under delicate circumstances, from an able 
Minister. He has further increased his reputation by asking leave, immediately after his report, to take 
the field, and by declining any recompense for his essential services ; a disinterestedness which forms a 
striking contrast between him and some other characters. Congress have given him a testimonial of their approbation, which I do myself the honor to inclose. 
I wish it may be in your Excellency's power to distinguish <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleage met'>Colonel Laurens</a> by a command. You may 
be assured that it will be highly pleasing to Congress. With every sentiment of affectionate attachment and respect, and the most sincere wishes for 
your glory and success, I have the honor to be, dear 
Sir, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most humble and most obedient servant,
