Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
This will accompany a (duplicate of mine dated the thirty-first of May. For the reasons mentioned in the beginning of 
that letter, I have not since written to you as I could have 
wished ; but in the interim I have received yours of the tenth 
of January, covering one of the third from your predecessor. 
Having already expressed my congratulations on your appointment, I shall not here repeat, but only confirm, what I 
then wrote respecting it. But I will mention my perfect satisfaction in perusing Mr Jefferson's statement of our dispute 
with Great Britain, which is, in my opinion, a masterly performance. I hope his abilities will not be lost to the public. 
</p><p>
At the same time, however, and with the same sincerity, I 
declare my belief, that the United States will gain by the 
change made in your department. Without balancing different qualities and qualifications, a difficult and unpleasant 
task, it is sufficient that we may now hope for a union of 
counsel and action among the different members of the Executive ; a thing which appears to me essential, and the want 
of which, or at least the idea that it was wanting, has, I know, 
been injurious. 
</p><p>
If my several letters have reached you, they will have 
communicated from time to time the best view which I could 
form of parties, temper, and opinions here. All these, however, are from the nature of things changeable, and it is only 
upon the final organization of a permanent government, and 
view of the territory over which it is to extend, that we 
can decide as to the prevailing interests and the system, which 
may thence originate. In all events, it appears probable that 
a friendly intercourse between the United States and the 
French nation will be mutually useful and desirable. Circumstances yet unborn may tend to relax or to strengthen our 
connexion. As they arise, and as they promise to arise, I 
shall study to communicate them. 
</p><p>
In mine of the thirty-first of May, I sent a copy of what I 
wrote on the nineteenth of that month to the Minister of Exterior Relations. I now transmit the copy of his answer 
of the tenth Prairial, or twenty-ninth of May, and eighteenth Prairial, or sixth of June, with my reply of the tenth of that 
month. Mr Warder came on hither the fourth of the present 
month, and has since pursued his route by the way of Switzerland ; but I have as yet heard nothing farther of the despatches he was charged with, although frequent inquiries 
have been made. I trust that they were not important, and am the less solicitous about them, as Mr Jay has doubtless 
taken over duplicates of everything essential. 
</p><p>
The gazettes will communicate, ere this reaches you, the 
great success of the French arms. As far as can be judged 
here, the King of Prussia has, according to custom, played a 
double part, and his troops, instead of joining those of the 
other Allies in Flanders, have remained where they were, 
while the French armies filed off to the left, and broke with 
irresistible impetuosity into the .Low Countries. These being 
quite open belong always to the party superior in the field. 
As yet, this Republic seems disposed rather to lay them 
under contribution, than to hold the possession ; but, if Valenciennes should submit, a different determination might take 
place. However, the sieges needful to secure them as far as 
the Rhine would consume more time than remains in this 
campaign ; for besides Luxemburg, Maestricht, and the citadel 
of Antwerp, which are on centrical situations, the whole frontier of Juliers, Guelderland, Cleves, Dutch Brabant, and 
Dutch Flanders, are stuck full of fortified towns. 
</p><p>
The success of the French arms will have secured that of 
Mr Jay's mission, whose object I learn from common report. 
The justice of the British Cabinet (whose sincerity the Presi 
dent is well acquainted with,) will, I am persuaded, submit to 
the forcible arguments, which Mr Jay is directed to use ; for 
the nation is not now in a temper to indulge Mr Pitt and Mr Simcoe in their projects. If I am rightly informed, there is an 
end to the coalition. Each party will retire as well as he can, 
and Britain will cover herself behind her wooden walls. In 
the case of a maritime struggle, they will not find the enmity 
of America to be a very pleasant thing. Of course, you will 
have abundant professions of good will, brotherly affection, &c. 
&c., and I believe they will now make sacrifices to keep us 
quiet, much more so to gain our assistance. But I will dwell 
no longer on this chapter, postponing all farther remarks, till 
the government of this country shall have adopted a plan for 
her ci-devant colonies. 
As to the interior affairs of France, one prominent and 
pleasant feature is an early and most abundant harvest. This 
is now gathering, and what is singular is the ripeness of 
wheat, barley, and oats at the same moment. In a few days, 
the whole crop will be secured, and they will begin to eat of 
it ; for there remains scarcely anything of last year's produce ; 
so that if the present had not been fit for use till towards the 
end of the next month, as is usually the case, God knows 
what would have become of us all. The abundance of the 
present year extends to every object, forage, pulse, roots, and 
other vegetables, as well as grain. The vineyards also promise more liquor than there are vessels to put it in. I conclude 
that we shall find little vent for our productions here, excepting our salted provisions, which must be in great demand. 
Moreover, I incline to the opinion that our vessels will not 
meet henceforward with the same vexations, which have been 
hitherto experienced , so that exportations of salted fish and 
flesh, may, I think, be safely encouraged for this country. To 
these may be added pot and pearl ashes, some flax seed and 
rice, also fish oil; and, in payment, our merchants will receive 
wines and brandies. 
</p><p>
There is at present a considerable ferment of parties, whose 
object, on the one hand, is to overturn, and, on the other, to 
preserve the colossal power of the two great Committees. 
Sooner or later that ferment must lead to an explosion, and 
the apprehension from the foreign enemy being greatly 
lessened, men turn more easily to the consideration of their 
domestic system. By a late decree, the Committee of Salut 
Public has secured to itself the promotion of one third to all 
places in the army, which gives them a stronger hold of that 
unwieldy instrument. Sooner or later, it must, unless dissolved, escape from the grasp of a multitudinous body. Such is 
the law of nature ; but that catastrophe is yet at a distance, 
and depends, I think, on the continuance of the war. Probably before it happens, the Committee will no longer exist in 
its present form ; for the mass of power there collected will, in 
the natural order of things, either excite so much envy as to 
dissolve the Committee, or, forcing them in self defence to 
increase it by severe and frequent exercise, so as to destroy 
all opposition, will generate in its bosom the causes of change. 
These are evils resulting from that state of violence in which 
society now exists, because in such state nothing can obtain a 
firm foundation ; and how long this may continue, God only 
knows. Hitherto power and property are at war, and the 
latter is a daily victim ; whereas it is their union, which can 
alone establish permament systems of government.

Mr Jefferson's letter of the thirteenth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, reached 
me above a year after its date. Immediately on receipt of it, 
I wrote to the Commissioner of Exterior Relations the letter dated the twenty-first of June, of which I enclose a copy, as also 
a copy of his answer of the nineteenth Messidor, or seventh instant, from which you will learn, that the million of livres, hitherto unaccounted for, was received by M. de Beaumarchais, and, 
of course, ought, in a new statement of his accounts, to be carried to his debit at the date. The operation will then, in all 
probability, be such as to eat up the balance reported to be due 
to him. I hope this information may reach you in season. It 
would have been transmitted long ago, if, by good fortune, a 
copy of that letter of the thirteenth of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1793'>1793</a>, had been 
sent by Captain Culver. 
</p><p>
I trouble you, Sir, with copies of my letters of the twenty-third and twenty-ninth of last month to the Commissioner of Exterior Relations, his of the sixteenth Messidor, or fourth of July, 
and of one just received from him of the thirtieth Messidor, or 
eighteenth of July, from which it would seem, that my numerous complaints are at length to be attended to. I am inclined 
to think that this will happen, and I am persuaded that in pro 
portion as our administration is firm and united, it will be powerful at home and respected abroad. I am, &c.

P, S. In making up my letter it occurs to me, that I had ta 
ken no notice of the strange complaints made against me by 
M. Genet, in his letter of the eighteenth of last September to the 
Secretary of State. I do not think it worth while to enter into 
the investigation of them ; and the more so, as the falsity of 
some, and the folly of others, are evident from facts in possession of your office, and from the style and nature of the com 
plaints themselves. But, while on this subject, it may not be 
amiss to mention, that, during the last winter in conversation with 
the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, (who, I am pretty sure, had 
instructed M. Fauchet to apply for my removal,) I told him that 
if this government wished for any person in my place, the best 
way would be to tell me so, and I would apply for my own recall. He answered by assurances of esteem. &tc. &LC.
