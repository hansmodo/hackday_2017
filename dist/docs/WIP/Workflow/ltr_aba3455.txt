SIR, 
</p><p>
Sickness for three weeks past has prevented my 
acknowledging the receipt of your letter of Sept. 
11th. When I first addressed you, I little thought of 
entering into a correspondence with you upon subjects of a political nature. I will not regret it, as 
it has led to some elucidations, and brought on some 
explanations, which place in a more favorable light 
occurrences which had wounded me. 
</p><p>
Having once entertained for you a respect and 
esteem, founded upon the character of an affectionate 
parent, a kind master, a candid and benevolent friend, I could not suffer different political opinions 
to obliterate them from my mind ; I felt the truth 
of the observation, that the heart is long, very long 
in receiving the conviction that is forced upon it byreason. It was not until circumstances concurred 
to place you in the light of a rewarder and encourager of a libeller, whom you could not but detest 
and despise, that I withdrew the esteem I had long 
entertained for you. Nor can you wonder, Sir, that 
I should consider as a personal unkindness, the instances I have mentioned. I am pleased to find that 
which respected my son altogether unfounded. He 
was, as you conjecture, appointed a commissioner 
of Bankruptcy, together with Judge Dawes, and 
continued to serve in it with perfect satisfaction to 
all parties, (at least I never heard the contrary,) 
until superseded by the appointment of others. The 
idea suggested that no one was in office, and consequently no removal could take place, I cannot consider in any other light than what the gentlemen 
of the law would term a quibble, as such I pass it. 
Judge Dawes was continued or re-appointed, which 
placed <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> in a more conspicuous light as 
the object of personal resentment. Nor could I, 
upon this occasion, refrain calling to mind the last 
visit you made me at Washington, when in the 
course of conversation you assured me, that if it 
should lay in your power at any time to serve 
me or my family, nothing would give you more 
pleasure, With respect to the office, it was a small 
object, but the disposition of the remover was considered by me as the barbed arrow. This, however, 
by your declaration, is withdrawn from my mind. 
With the public it will remain. And here, Sir, may 
I be allowed to pause, and ask whether, in your 
ardent desire to rectify the mistakes and abuses, as 
you may term them, of the former administrations, 
you may not be led into measures still more fatal 
to the Constitution, and more derogatory to your 
honor and independence of character ? I know, 
from the observations which I have made, that there 
is not a more difficult part devolves upon a Chief 
Magistrate, nor one which subjects him to more 
reproach and censure, than the appointment to office. 
And all the patronage which this enviable power 
gives him is but a poor compensation for the responsibility to which it subjects him. It would be well, 
however, to weigh and consider characters, as it 
respects their moral worth and integrity. He who 
is not true to himself, nor just to others, seeks an 
office for the benefit of himself, unmindful of that of 
his country. 
</p><p>
I cannot accord with you in opinion that the Constitution ever meant to withhold from the National 
Government the power of self-defence ; or that it 
could be considered an infringement of the Liberty 
of the Press, to punish the licentiousness of it. 
</p><p>
Time must determine, and posterity will judge, 
with more candor and impartiality, I hope, than the 
conflicting parties of our day, what measures have 
best promoted the happiness of the people ; what 
raised them from a state of depression and degradation to wealth, honor and reputation ; what has made 
them affluent at home and respected abroad ; and to 
whomsoever the tribute is due, to them may it be 
given. 
</p><p>
I will not any further intrude upon your time ; 
but close this correspondence by my wishes that you 
may be directed to that path which may terminate in 
the prosperity and happiness of the people over 
whom you are placed, by administering the government with justice and impartiality. And be assured, 
Sir, no one will more rejoice in your success than 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.

MEMORANDUM, 
</p><p>
[Subjoined to the copy of this letter, in the handwriting of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>.] 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, 19 November, 1804. 
</p><p>
The whole of this correspondence was begun and 
conducted without my knowledge or suspicion. Last 
evening and this morning, at the desire of Mrs. 
Adams, I read the whole. I have no remarks to 
make upon it, at this time and in this place.
