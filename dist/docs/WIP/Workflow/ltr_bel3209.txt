DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Sir Harry seems to be collecting his force on 
James's Island, and is there throwing up some works ; 
one among the ruins of Fort Johnson, another a little to the westward of it. It is said that he is also 
throwing up a bomb-battery opposite the town. Drawing his principal force to this Island, hauling his galleys and other armed vessels of small draught of 
water near the mouth of Wappoo, collecting a number of boats there, indicate that an attempt on the 
southerly part of the town, by boats, will be made. 
It is pretty evident that he means to introduce his 
ships into the harbour, which I find he may effect 
with more safety than I once supposed he could ; for 
our frigates, which it was thought could lie before 
the bar, so as to command the entrance of it, appear to draw too much water for the purpose, and cannot 
anchor with safety nearer to it than three miles, and there they are liable to be annoyed from the shore; 
and the channel is so narrow that they cannot anchor in line of battle. It is the opinion of all the 
Captains of the ships, that they can render more 
essential services by lying abreast, and acting in con 
junction with Fort Moultrie, than by taking any 
other post. 
</p><p>
General Hogan's arrival, last night, gives great happiness and spirit to the garrison; for we were be 
fore, and are now, much too weak ; we have but very 
little support from the country militia of this State ;there are but about two hundred of them in town, 
and it will be with difficulty that they will be 
brought into it, notwithstanding the exertions of the 
executive. The spirit with which they are conducting themselves, your Excellency will learn by the 
inclosed proclamation. 
</p><p>
The southern part of the State is exposed to the 
immediate incursions of the enemy, and to the depredations of the Tories. This, at present, keeps a 
number of men in that part in arms, to protect their 
families and property, which they say cannot be re 
moved. In the middle part of the country most of 
the inhabitants are disaffected, and a few days since 
were in arms, and killed a number of people. This 
forbids any troops being drawn from that part of the 
country; force might be sent into it. The frontiers 
of the State are obliged to arm to restrain the savages, and for the defence of themselves, and the upper part of Georgia. The Eastern Shore is left for 
the defence of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> and the sea-coast. 
</p><p>
Governor Caswell has, in the most pointed terms, 
ordered on the whole of the late drafts of three thousand. About one third of them are arrived, and 
he has directed two thousand more to embody near the bounds of the northerly part of this State, to act 
in either State, as circumstances may require. I was 
in hopes General Scott would have been here before 
now, but I cannot learn that he has yet left Peters 
burg. 
</p><p>
Our works are constantly going on, and matters 
every day grow better. The people are recovering 
their spirits, and have now high expectations. I 
have the honor to be, my dear General, with the 
highest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
