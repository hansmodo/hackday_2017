Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my return this evening from Rye, I found your letter 
of the 18th instant at my house. It is not difficult to perceive that your situation is unpleasant, and it is easy to 
predict that your enemies will endeavour to render it still 
more so. The thorns they strew in your way will (if you 
please) hereafter blossom, and furnish garlands to decorate 
your administration. Resolve nol to be driven from your 
station, and as your situation must, it seems, be militant, act 
accordingly. Envy will tell posterity that your difficulties, 
from the state of things, wore inconsiderable, compared 
with the great, growing, and untouched resources of the 
nation. Your difficulties from persons and party will, by 
time, be carried out of sight, unless you prevent it. ?Co 
other person will possess sufficient facts and details to do 
full justice to the subject, and I think your reputation points 
to the expediency of memoirs. You want time, it is true, 
but few of us know how much time we can find when we 
set about it. 
</p><p>
Had not your letter come from the post-office, I should 
suspect it had been opened. The wafer looked very much 
like it. Such letters should be sealed with wax, impressed 
with your seal. 
</p><p>
I rejoice with you in the re-election of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>. It 
has relieved my mind from much inquietude. It is a great 
point gained ; but the unceasing industry and arts of the 
Anties render perseverance, union, and constant efforts 
necessary. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear sir. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
