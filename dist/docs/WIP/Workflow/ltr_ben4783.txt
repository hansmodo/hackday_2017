DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
Your favour of January 8th came duly to hand, but I 
have been so much engaged during the sitting of Parliament, 
that I could not correspond regularly with all my friends, 
and have of course trespassed most with those on whose good 
nature and indulgence I could most rely. I am, however, 
ashamed of being so long silent. It was but the other day, 
that I inquired after the fate of your tickets, when I received 
the enclosed answer, whereby you will see that the whole 
cost has not been lost. I only wished to see three ciphers 
more following the sum. I have not any further orders from 
you, but think to take at a venture two tickets more on your 
account. If you disapprove and choose to rest where you 
are, signify it by a line, before the drawing, directed to Messrs. 
Smith, Wright, and Grey, who may then dispose of the 
tickets.

I am glad to hear the old gentleman, your father, is still 
alive and happy. Please to remember me to him respectfully. Probably he can recollect but little of me, as it is a 
good deal more than half a century since he has seen me; 
but I remember him well, a lively, active, handsome young 
man, with a fine full flowing head of hair. I suppose he 
must now be near fourscore.

If I could have given you any intimation of the intentions of government with regard to America, that might be 
depended upon, you should have had them in good time for 
use, in the views of trade you hint at. But there have been 
this winter such changes of men and of minds, and such continual expectations of more and other changes, that nothing 
was certain; and I believe that to this day the ministry are 
not all of a mind, nor determined what are the next steps 
proper to be taken with us. Some are said to be for severe, 
others for lenient measures ; others for leaving things as they 
now are, in confidence that we shall soon be tired of our 
non-importation agreements, manufacturing schemes, and 
self-denying frugalities, submit to the duties, and return by 
degrees to our dear luxuries and idleness, with our old course 
of commercial extravagance, folly, and good humour. Which 
of these opinions will prevail and be acted on, it is impossible 
yet to say. I only know, that generally the dispute is thought 
a dangerous one, and that many wish to see it well compromised in time, lest by a continuance of mutual provocations 
the breach should become past healing. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you and cousin Hubbard for your 
kindness to my friend Hughes, of which he informed me, 
with many expressions of gratitude for your civilities. He 
would have been very happy in that station, and in your 
acquaintance so nigh him ; but he is now removed to Carolina. 
</p><p>
My love to your good wife and children, and believe me 
ever your affectionate uncle, B. FRANKLIN.
