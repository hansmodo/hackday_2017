Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for the sermon on the death of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met friend'>General Washington</a>, which you was so obliging as to send me. 
In my opinion, it abounds in excellent sentiments, well 
arranged and expressed. Writing thus freely, I think it 
candid to observe, that in some instances ideas are conveved which do not appear to me to be correct ; such, for 
instance, as " our glorious emancipation from Britain." 
The Congresses of <a href='/results.php?year=1771'>1771</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a> regarded the people of 
this country as being free ; and such was their opinion of 
the liberty we enjoyed so late as the year <a href='/results.php?year=1763'>1763</a>, that they 
declared the colonies would be satisfied on being replaced 
in the political situation in which they then were. It was 
not until after the year 17 03, that Britain attempted to subject us to arbitrary domination. We resisted the stamp act 
with energy and success ; and when afterward she claimed to 
bind us in all cases whatever, the same spirit of resistance 
animated' our councils and our conduct : when she recurred 
to arms to put a yoke upon us, we recurred to arms to keep 
it off. A struggle ensued which produced the revolution, 
and ended in an entire dissolution of all the political ties 
which had before subsisted between the two countries. 
Thus we became a distinct nation; audi think truth will 
justify our indulging the pride of saying, that we and our 
ancestors have kept our necks free from yokes, and that the 
term emancipation is not applicable to us. 
</p><p>
Speaking of the measures of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met friend'>General Washington</a>'s civil 
administration, you observe, and so is the fact, " that there 
is less unanimity among his countrymen with respect to 
these, than with respect to his military services." But, do 
facts warrant our ascribing this diminution of unanimity 
entirely to doubts respecting the wisdom of those measures? 
The revolution found and left only two primary parties, 
viz. the whigs who succeeded, and the tories who were 
suppressed. The former were unanimous in approving 
the leading measures, both civil and military, which gave 
them victory. When the adoption of the new constitution 
afterward came into question, the whigs divided into two 
parties, the one for and the other against it. The party for 
the constitution prevailed ; and they have with as great 
unanimity approved of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met friend'>General Washington</a>'s civil as of 
his military measures and services. The party opposed 
to the constitution disapproved of the government established by it ; and there are very few of the important 
measures of that government which have escaped their 
censure. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of making these remarks from the respect I have for your talents ; and an opinion, that with due 
circumspection they will promote the great interests of 
truth, virtue, and national liberty. Receive them, therefore, as marks of the esteem with which I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
