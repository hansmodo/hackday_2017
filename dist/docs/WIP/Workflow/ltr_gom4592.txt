Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the seventeenth of December, which reached me several days ago, but no good opportunity then presented itself to convey a reply. The 
idea you formed of the British cabinet was, I am persuaded, perfectly just. This government has lately taken some steps, 
which cannot but be advantageous to their rivals, for T am persuaded that the late duress laying a heavy duty on oil, giving 
a great preference of duty on tobacco imported in French 
ships, and declaring that none but those built in France shall 
be reputed French bottoms, will excite much ill humor in 
America. Those who rule here seem to think, that because 
the old government was sometimes wrong, everything contrary 
to what they did must be right ; like Jack in the Tale of the 
Tub, who tore his coat to pieces in pulling off the fringe, points, 
and trimmings that Peter had put on. Or like the Old Congress in its young days, which rejected the offer of valuable 
contracts, and employed a host of commissaries and quarter 
masters, because Great Britain dealt with contractors. 
</p><p>
In the debate on this subject one of the Lameths gave it as 
his opinion, that America was not in a situation to be either 
sought or feared for some time to come. This, which is not 
however the sentiment of the party, occasioned some hints in 
the close of the observations I sent to M. de Montmorin, and 
of which a copy has been transmitted to Mr Jefferson. I 
hope that the Congress will not act precipitately in consequence 
of these decrees, for I believe that proper representations in a 
proper moment will produce a change, and really, in the pre 
sent effervescence, very few acts of the Assembly can be considered as deliberate movements of national will. 
</p><p>
Congress has commenced its third session. Our affairs assume 
a good aspect. Public credit is high, and stocks have arisen amazingly. Except the disturbances occasioned by a few hostile Indians on 
our western frontier (instigated thereto, I am persuaded, by the British 
traders,) and some remains of the old leven, the wheels of government 
move without interruption, and gather strength as they move. The 
numbers of our people, so far as they can be ascertained by the present 
state of the census, will not fall short, it is said, of five millions ; some 
think more. Whilst this will on the one hand astonish Europe, it 
may on the other add consequence to the union of these Stales. 
There still continue to be three parties here. The Enrages, 
long since known by the name of Jacobins, have lost much in 
the public opinion, so that they are less powerful in the Assembly than they were ; but their Committees of Correspondence, 
(called Societes Patriotiques) spread all over the kingdom, have 
given them a deep, strong hold of the people. On the other 
hand, the numerous reforms, some of them unnecessary and all 
either harsh, precipitate, or extreme, have thrown into the aristocratic party a great number of discontented. The military, who 
as such look up to the sovereign, are somewhat less factious than 
they were, but they are rather a mob than an army, and must, I 
think, fall either to the Aristocratic or Jacobin side of the question. 
</p><p>
The middle men are in a whimsical situation. In the Sen 
ate they follow the Jacobin counsels, rather than appear connected with the other party. The same principle of shame-faced-ness operates on great occasions out of doors ; but as the Aristocrats have been forced down by a torrent of opinion from the 
heights of their absurd pretensions, and as the middle men begin 
to be alarmed at the extremities to which they have been hurried, these two parties might come together, if it were not for 
personal animosities among the leaders. This middle party 
would be the strongest, if the nation were virtuous ; but, alas, 
this is not the case, and therefore I think it will only serve as a 
stepping stone for those, who may find it convenient to change 
sides. 
</p><p>
In the midst however of all these confusions, what with confiscating the church property, selling the domains, curtailing 
pensions, and destroying offices, but especially by that great liquidater of public debts, a paper currency, this nation is working its way to a new state of active energy, which will I think 
be displayed as soon as a vigorous government shall establish 
itself. The intervening confusions will probably call forth men 
of talents to form such government and to exert its powers.

In a letter I had the honor to write on the twenty-second of 
November, I mentioned a treaty made between the Baltic powers. I do not know whether I drew this idea from information 
or conjecture, but it was in my mind and still continues there. 
While in England waiting at Whitehall for the Duke of Leeds, 
who was accidentally prevented from keeping his appointment, 
I had a long conversation with Mr Burgess, who seemed desirous of convincing me, that he was an efficient man in the office of Foreign Affairs. I asked him whether such treaty existed, insinuating that he must certainly be informed of every 
movement in that, as in every other quarter. He assured me 
positively that it did not ; but that assurance did not alter my 
opinion. Indeed the object of my question was to discover, 
whether they were at all upon terms with Sweden, and from 
what afterwards passed, I am persuaded that they are not. I 
must add that my inquiries here have been answered in the 
same way, but yet I believe that such a treaty exists. He 
spoke a good deal of the convention with Spain, and I declared 
freely my opinion, which being favorable to the administration, 
drew from him in support of it a history of the negotiation. It 
ended (as he said) in this remarkable manner. The Count de 
Florida Blanca, upon hearing of the revolt of the French Marine, 
told the British Ambassador ; You insist on the terms to which 
I am now about to agree, not because they are just, but be 
cause I am compelled to it. If France would assist us I would 
never submit ; but we are not able singly to cope with you, and 
therefore you must do as you please. You will judge, my 
dear Sir, how long such a treaty is likely to last. 
</p><p>
I am delighted with the account you give me of our public 
affairs. There can be no doubt that a publication of the census, and a clear state of our finances, will impress a sense of 
our importance on the statesmen of Europe. We are now get 
ting forward in the right way, not by little skirmishing advantages 
of political manoeuvres, but in a solid column of well formed national strength. Like Father Mason's aristocratic screw, which 
you doubtless remember, at every turn we shall now gain and 
hold what we get. It is no evil that you should have a little of 
the old leven. I have always considered an opposition in free 
governments as a kind of outward conscience, which prevents 
the administration from doing many things through inadvertence, 
which they might repent of. By these means both men and 
measures are sifted, and the necessity of appearing as well as of 
being right confirms and consolidates the good opinion of society. I expect and am indeed certain, that this good opinion 
will live with you during life, and follow weeping to your grave. 
I know you will continue to deserve it, and I hope you may long 
live to vex your enemies by serving your country. I am, &c.
