DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor to receive your favor 
of the 3d instant, by Bennet, who overtook me on 
my way to this place. All is in readiness to move, 
as soon as the Lakes open, which, I hope, will be in 
a day or two. General Thomas is here, six companies of Burrell's regiment from Connecticut, two 
companies of the First Pennsylvania Battalion, and 
three of the New Jersey. The remainder of these 
corps arc gone on, whereof two companies are about 
forty-five miles below Crown Point; the rest have 
reached Canada, We have also here two companies 
of Van Schaick s, of this Colony; and five companies 
of the Second Pennsylvania Battalion are at Fort 
Edward, waiting for the Lake to open, as I have no 
quarters for them at this place. The remainder of 
Van Schaick's are not yet raised; and two companies 
of the First Pennsylvania Battalion are on their way 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely happy, my dear General, to 
pay my devoirs to you at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; but I do not 
see a possibility of quitting this quarter, without risking  all in Canada. Unless some other general officer 
should relieve me, I shall, therefore, presume to remain, unless I receive your further orders. 
</p><p>
Four o clock, P. M. This moment the post from 
Canada is arrived. I inclose you copies of all the 
papers I received. The intelligence they afford is so 
alarming., that I beg leave to repeat my wish that a 
considerable body of troops should be immediately 
sent up. 
</p><p>
I have stopped the courier at this place, and he 
goes back immediately to advise our friends in Canada, that the troops now here will soon be in 
Canada; and I have presumed to add, that they will 
be followed by three or four thousand more. This 
intelligence will keep up their spirits, and intimidate 
our enemies. 
</p><p>
I have, heretofore, observed to your Excellency, 
that I had never received a return of the army in 
Canada. I am, on that account, still incapable of let 
ting you know the strength of our army there. I am 
equally in the dark with respect to the arrangement 
made in officering the two regiments that were to 
be raised out of the troops that wintered there. 
</p><p>
The provisions at these posts are very trifling. 
None of what General Lee has contracted for is 
come to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; and, unless a speedy supply is sent 
up, our troops in Canada must suffer. I have written 
on this subject to General Thompson before I left 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>; and although I make not the least doubt 
but that he will forward it, if he can, yet I beg 
leave to mention it, lest he should forget to mention 
it on the arrival of his superior officer at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I am seized with a copious scorbutic eruption, 
which I have frequently experienced, and imagined 
it threw off some other more disagreeable disorder. 
I believe it will not confine me, or prevent me from 
doing my duty. I am, dear General, most sincerely, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
