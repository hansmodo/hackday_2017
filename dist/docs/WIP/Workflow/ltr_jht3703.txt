Sir, 
</p><p>
The very interesting and important news of the 
surrender of General Lord CornwalliS; with the British 
army, shipping, &c., &c., under his command, reached 
me on the 26th ultimo by a vessel from the Chesapeake to Rhode Island ; and the full confirmation, a 
few days since by a letter from my son. My warmest and most sincere congratulations await your Excellency on an event so honorable and glorious to 
yourself, so interesting and happy to the United 
States ; — an event, which cannot fail to strengthen 
the impressions of the European powers in favor of the 
great and good cause, in which you have so long and 
so successfully contended, and go far to convince the 
haughty King of Great Britain, that it is in vain to 
persevere in his cruel and infamous purpose of enslaving a people, who can boast of Generals and armies that neither fear to meet his veterans in the 
high places of the field, or pursue them to their 
strong-holds of security, and for whose help the arm 
of the Almighty has been made bare, and his salvation rendered gloriously conspicuous; — an event, 
which will hasten the wished-for happy period, when 
your Excellency may retire to and securely possess 
the sweets of domestic felicity and glorious rest from 
the toils of war, surrounded by the universal applauses of a free, grateful, and happy people. 
</p><p>
The very important assistance and powerful cooperation afforded by the fleet and army of our illustrious ally, the King of France, demand the most 
grateful acknowledgments. The gallant and intrepid conduct of the Commanders and Officers of both, has 
acquired them great glory, and entitles them and 
their army to the warmest thanks of America. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has been made acquainted with 
the destruction lately committed upon New London 
and Groton, by a considerable force of the enemy 
under the infamous traitor, whose name and memory 
should rot. A force much more considerable has been 
kept there since. They have done much to repair 
the injury done to the fortifications; and particularly 
that on Groton side, which entirely commands the 
town and harbour, is already in much better condition than before, and the work is still going on. 
And, as I take it for granted that part of the naval 
force of his most Christian Majesty will remain on 
the station through the winter, I would take leave 
to offer to the consideration of your Excellency, that 
they may be stationed at the port of New London, 
which I conceive would be attended with advantages 
superior, with respect to themselves and the country, 
to any place they could choose. The harbour is very 
sufficient to contain any number and size of ships ; 
is peculiarly safe from the injuries of wind or storms. 
Its immediate connection with the main renders it 
accessible by the militia in case of need; and, adjoining to a country, through the favor of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
at present abounding with every kind of provision 
they can want, will render their supplies much more 
easy and safe than at the Island where they last 
wintered, and where they received great part of their 
supplies by water from New London, exposed to loss 
and capture, and which actually did, and must always, happen in some instances. 
</p><p>
I have very lately received a pressing request from 
his Excellency, the General of Martinico, for large supplies of fresh beef from this State, for the use of 
the garrisons and hospitals there. I purpose to permit and encourage private adventures to furnish it, 
which must be shipped from that port. The lying 
of a fleet there would greatly secure and protect the 
coasts, for a considerable distance, against the armed 
vessels of the enemy, who will doubtless get knowledge of the design, and be engaged to intercept vessels with such cargoes. And, for their more effectual protection, I must also request a convoy of a 
frigate, armed sloop, or something adequate, for any 
number of vessels which may be ready to sail, and 
ask your Excellency's direction in that respect also 
and on the assurance of which, I doubt not, a full 
and speedy supply might and would be afforded ; 
and without it I fear it will fall short. 
</p><p>
Permit me to add, in favor of the town which has 
so severely suffered, that a fleet stationed there would 
also afford relief and help to many of the distressed 
inhabitants, who have lost their all; and would be 
a protection to as much property, taken from the 
enemy, as perhaps is brought into any port standing 
in need of such protection. 
</p><p>
On the whole, I submit these and other reasons, 
which will readily occur to your Excellency's wisdom 
and candor. With every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, I have the honor to be, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,
