Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 2d . inst: has just reached me. Our mutual friend <a href='/results.php?tla=roc' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Colt</a> has already apprized me of the 
advantage which I might expect from your confidential communication, &amp; your letter satisfies me that he has not 
overrated the value of them. I beg you to believe that I shall always be gratified at hearing from you whenever any thing 
occurs which you deem interesting and that I am perfectly prepared always to reciprocate your confidence.

It is my anxious desire to see your Office at the head of the business of N. York, and for that purpose not to suffer

out of the receipt of their paper and a profitable and accommodating exchange business. The practice here is this. 
Every morning the Clerks from this Bank and the State Banks meet and inter change the notes received respectively on the preceeding day. The Balances are Struct accordingly but no Bank ever calculates on its Balance remaining for any length of time &amp; whenever it grows a little too large, no Bank ever hesitates to send for ten or 
fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from its debtor. We had the other day a draft for $25,000 from one of our City 
Banks which was paid as cheerfully &amp; with as little sensation as if it had been a check for $25. Whenever there is a 
draft from an individual for Specie to any amount the State Banks are made to pay it if their Balances allow it. Thus it 
goes round no one complains and every one is Satisfied. In truth, it is only when these balances accumulate &amp; remain for any length of time that they become oppressive to both parties and excite mutual ill will. You have now a fine oportunity of establishing and maintaining your preeminence and I hope anxiously that it will not be lost. The other subjects of your letter will receive an early attention, but 
my occupations this morning allow me time only to acknowledge the receipt of it thus briefly &amp; to add that I am
