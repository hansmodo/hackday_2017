SIR, 
</p><p>
Last night I was favored with your letter of yesterday's date. 
The return you request is by this conveyance transmitted to his 
Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a>. Surgeons, medicines, and attendance, with every comfort imaginable, have been amply supplied 
to the sick and wounded officers and soldiers, prisoners at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>, as it is the wish of every generous mind, that the calamities of war should lie as light as possible upon unhappy individuals who are wounded or taken. You will be satisfied these 
are my sentiments when you examine Ensign and Quarter-master 
Sanders, who were brought by one of my scouts, last year, to 
<a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. In Brigadier-General St. Leger's retreat from Fort Stanwix, and during the siege thereof, some British officers and 
soldiers have fallen into our hands. As soon as I know their 
names, they shall be sent to you in writing. Your letter, ad 
dressed to the senior British officer, is sent to <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. I 
have the honor to be, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
