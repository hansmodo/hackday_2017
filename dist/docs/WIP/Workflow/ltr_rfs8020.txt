[REPLY OF COMMODORE R. F. STOCKTON TO THE LETTER FROM CITIZENS OF TOM's RIVER.]
</p><p>
To Messrs. F. J. Speer, W. I. James, James Grulick, Benjamin L. Irons, and others, citizens of the county of Ocean. 
</p><p>
GENTLEMEN: In consequence of my absence from Princeton, I did not see your letter until it was published in the Monmouth Democrat. 
</p><p>
It would, nevertheless, have been sooner acknowledged had not numerous engagements prevented. The act to which you refer, I assure you, gave me no annoyance. If in the exercise of the 
largest liberty any of my fellow-citizens see fit to recreate them selves by executing effigies which they please to designate  Commodore Stockton, they are welcome to all the enjoyment and glory 
they can derive from amusements so harmless. While conscious of the rectitude of my own actions and intentions, malicious denunciations move me not. 
</p><p>
It is now nearly a quarter of a century since I devoted my mind, my means, and those of co-operating friends whom I could influence, to the cause of internal improvement in New Jersey. When I consider the inadequacy of my experience and abilities to the vast 
enterprise in which I then engaged, the difficulties to be encountered, and the slender resources which at first were within my control, and then advert to the realization of my proudest hopes, and 
more especially when I survey the benefits which, in part through 
my instrumentality, have been conferred upon New Jersey by this 
system of internal improvements, which I have advocated and defended, I can well tolerate with indifference any abuse which my 
success and my fidelity to the true interests and welfare of my 
native State may provoke. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, you say that a majority of the people here are 
opposed to the measures of the party with which you co-operate, 
and to the State policy of which you are an able advocate. With 
regard to party measures, I do not care a rush; but in relation 
to the improvement of New Jersey I do feel deeply concerned, and 
will hope that the time is not far distant when there will be little 
or no difference of opinion between us. No doubt the time has 
been, when a formidable opposition existed in New Jersey to the 
system of internal improvements with which I have been identified. 
The papers teemed with abuse of me, and a powerful party threatened the extinction of private rights and the violation of public honour. I placed myself in the breach on those occasions ; but I 
never deprecated abuse, nor retorted the intemperate fulminations 
of political adversaries. I chose rather to let results speak for mo. 
To their verdict I always confidently appeal. I was willing to 
stand or fall with the success or failure of the system which I recommended. Now that these results have proved eminently fortunate now that triumphant success vindicates my system, though I 
may continue to treat defamation with silence and calumny with 
contempt, I shall on no fitting occasion like the present fail to remind my fellow-citizens that they owe the present prosperity of 
New Jersey, under God, first, to the system of internal improvement now subsisting, and, second, to the adherence by the State 
and the joint companies to the principles of plighted good faith and honour. 
</p><p>
Interposing between the two great commercial emporiums of the 
continent the natural bridge for all internal intercourse between 
the North and the South, her commerce absorbed and diverted from 
her own harbours, New Jersey was bound by every dictate of political sagacity to make the most of her territorial advantages, and 
to compensate herself therefrom for the injuries inflicted by the 
overshadowing rivalship of New York and Philadelphia. The first 
great desideratum for the accomplishment of this object was the 
construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal. The success of 
the Hudson and Erie Canal inspired many with a desire that New 
Jersey should make the Delaware and Raritan Canal a State work. 
</p><p>
The State wisely (as events have shown) shrunk from the danger 
of encumbering herself with debt. She was not possessed of the 
vast resources of New York, and, judging from the analogy furnished by State prosecution and management of public works else 
where, it is quite probable that, had this State commenced the 
construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal, she would 
have abandoned it before its completion, and, instead of pouring 
its contributions (as at present) into her treasury, the debt incurred for its commencement would hang like an incubus on her prosperity. 
</p><p>
For more than ten years subsequent to the completion of the 
canal, the receipts of the joint companies for toll hardly paid its 
expenses. How would the State have sustained herself under such 
a result, even if she had completed the construction of the canal ? 
She would probably have been compelled by public clamour to have 
sacrificed it to speculators, who would assume only half of her indebtedness, just as Pennsylvania is now endeavouring to dispose of 
her public works. The State of New Jersey pursued a more cautious policy; she conferred a liberal charter on a company for the 
construction of the canal. The company which have completed it were secured against ruinous competition, and have been thereby 
enabled patiently to await the growth of business on that great work. 
</p><p>
Contemporaneous with the incorporation of the Canal Company, 
the State incorporated also the Camden and Amboy Railroad and 
Transportation Company. At that time the nature and uses of 
railroads were but little known or understood, and no one was aware 
of the mighty capacity of the steam locomotive. I foresaw that 
the Delaware and Raritan Canal could not be constructed while 
menaced with the rivalship of a railroad. The public men of New 
Jersey and the people soon became impressed with the same views ; 
they saw in competition none of those benign influences which its 
over-zealous friends attribute to it. They were not willing to risk 
the defeat of the canal for the sake of encouraging a ruinous com 
petition, principally for the benefit of the inhabitants of other States. They established, then, after careful deliberation, the 
policy and the system which have continued to this day, a system 
which, whether called a monopoly or any thing else, has vindicated 
itself. That system insured the construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal; it insured also two other railroad thoroughfares 
across the State ; adequate accommodations, at reasonable fares, for 
the transit of all freight and passengers over the State ; it insured, 
too, just compensation to the State for the privileges conferred, 
yielding an abundant and increasing revenue, and, in the progress 
of time and the development of the system, it secured likewise the 
construction of all local roads which may be needed in the southern 
and western parts of the State, when, without it, they would hardly 
be made in the lifetime of the present generation. And lastly, that 
system, after all doubt about the productiveness of the canal and 
railroads shall have been dispelled, and after experience shall have 
demonstrated the most judicious and economical method of managing them, invests the State with the right to take them at their 
appraised value. Should she do so at the time when by law she is 
authorized to exercise her option so to do, and should she conduct 
them wisely and economically, there can be no doubt they will 
make New Jersey, in proportion to her population, the most opulent 
and flourishing State in America or elsewhere. 
</p><p>
Now, in contrast with the results of this system of New Jersey, 
cast your eyes over our sister States, where State construction and 
management of public works, and boundless competition, have prevailed. In one case you perceive powerful States crippled with 
debt and tormented with vexatious taxation, oppressing industry and depreciating the value of the property of the people. In the 
other case you see gigantic corporations tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, and threatening, in their fall, to cover the land with 
desolation, impoverishing widows and orphans the rich and those who are not rich. 
</p><p>
Unrestricted competition, when applied to railroad constructions, 
is an enormous and delusive fraud ; it is a fraud because it promises 
advantages which it cannot confer ; . it allures into a snare the 
unwary, the ignorant, and the helpless, and involves them all in 
one fatal catastrophe. 
</p><p>
It is far better for the public to have one good railroad than two 
inferior railroads. The real interests of the people of the whole 
country are not promoted by railroads transporting freight and 
passengers at a loss. The interest of no class can be permanently promoted by the industry of any other class being underpaid. 
Unrestricted competition in the construction of railroads, by producing inadequate compensation for railroad services, has a tendency 
to destroy capital. The destruction of capital is a calamity to the 
whole community. It checks enterprise and deprives labour of 
employment. There is another reason why such unrestricted com 
petition is a fraud. It eventually places the weaker competitor in 
the power of the stronger, making the rich richer, and the powerful more powerful, and finally terminates in a more inexorable and 
omnipotent monopoly than otherwise could be possible. 
</p><p>
When, under the sanction of legislative enactment, a large capital 
is invested in such a work as a great railroad or canal, the objects 
of which are the promotion of the public interests as well as those 
of individuals, when that capital is unalterably fixed, and converted 
into such a public improvement, and in the shape of stock-shares 
diffused throughout the community in the hands of men of limited 
means, held in part by the comparatively poor by widows and 
orphans by executors and administrators eleemosynary institutions, it ought to be considered as under the aegis of the public protection. 
</p><p>
Were an incendiary to fire the shop and stations of such a rail 
road company, to tear up its rails, destroy its bridges, or in any 
way wantonly injure its structures, he would be deemed worthy of 
condign punishment, and the condemnation of all men would make 
him infamous. Yet, under the plausible pretext of competition, 
still more destructive and pernicious injuries are inflicted upon the 
enterprising capitalist and his helpless and confiding friends, who 
may have embarked their whole worldly substance in a railroad or 
a canal. 
</p><p>
I care not what circumstances furnish the occasion for such unrighteous legislation ; when such wrongs are perpetrated, they are 
equivalent to robbery; they have no foundation in justice; they 
are exertions of despotic power, irrespective of the principles of honour or justice. It is impossible for the interests of any community to be advanced by the violation of the eternal principles of justice. 
</p><p>
These conclusions are established by experience, as exhibited in 
the consequences of unrestricted railroad competition in New England, in New York, and in Great Britain. New Jersey has wisely 
repudiated the fraud and folly of a reckless and destructive competition. And the public enjoys the benefit of her wisdom and 
prudence, in the most ample accommodations, upon fair terms, of 
the facilities offered by her public works. The proprietors of these 
works, controlled by no sordid or circumscribed view of their duties 
and obligations, strong in the confidence of the people, and grateful for the good faith and support which have always been manifested 
towards them by the State and their fellow-citizens, feel an abiding 
disposition to comply with all the just requisitions of an enlightened 
public, and will ultimately be able, from the abundance of their 
resources and their strength, to transport both passengers and 
freight at lower rates than any ill-judged competition could ever 
have compelled. 
</p><p>
Next in importance to the adoption of the present system of 
internal improvement in New Jersey, in estimating the causes of 
her prosperity, may be ranked the firmness and consistency with 
which the joint companies and the State have adhered, through all 
the phases of monetary and political affairs, to the principles of honour and plighted faith. 
</p><p>
There has been no time within the last twenty years when the 
joint companies, by the simple relinquishment of all opposition to 
efforts for the establishment of competing railroads, could not have 
rid themselves of all contributions to the State Treasury, and vastly 
augmented their profits and income, while at the same time they 
could have defeated any actual competition. They have, however, 
turned a deaf ear to all overtures contemplating such results, even 
when the madness of party seemed to create a necessity for such 
action. They have stood at the portals of the State Treasury, its 
protector and defender, when others have sought the destruction of 
the State revenue and credit. I do not exaggerate when I say that 
it has always been considered by the joint companies a paramount 
obligation to consult the interest of the State. 
</p><p>
And now, after having devoted the best portion of my life to the 
promotion of the interests, the happiness, and prosperity of New 
Jersey, after having been so long in contact with her public men, 
her legislators, and her most intelligent citizens in all parts of the 
State, if there be a man whom I have deceived or misled, whose 
confidence I have abused, or who can justly charge me with any 
violation of the strictest principles of honour and integrity in my 
intercourse with him, I am yet to know him. 
</p><p>
It is because my fellow-citizens know that I have been thus 
governed by the severest principles of honour that they have stood 
by me to baffle and defeat those who, no matter under what pretence or profession, sought to endanger the State revenue. Demagogues 
have in vain attempted, by all the acts of political chicanery, to 
corrupt their principles or excite their cupidity. There never has 
been a year or a day, in spite of all the lavish expenditure of foreign 
adventurers or the marshalled array of faction, when any man 
could stand up in the Legislature of New Jersey and propose the 
violation of the State's compact with the joint companies, without 
incurring the doom of universal execration and contempt. 
</p><p>
Vindictively as I have been assailed for my connection with these 
companies, identical as their prostration has been sought to be 
made with the triumph first of one party and then of another, 
ingeniously as astute lawyers and politicians have proved the in 
fraction of the public faith to be compatible with law and justice, 
there has been no time when any of these attacks, or propositions, 
or sophisms, have made any serious impression on the public mind. 
That public mind has been too honest and too sagacious to cherish 
error, or to be led, even by its passions or its prejudices, to the com 
mission of injustice. 
</p><p>
There is no State in the Union there is, in my opinion, no State 
in the world in which public faith and the rights and property of 
men are more secure than in New Jersey. There is no State in 
which stronger temptations have been offered to violate the sanctity 
of State obligations than here ; but there is no State in which such 
temptations have been more contemptuously spurned or more 
universally despised. To live in such a State, to be citizens of such 
a commonwealth, is a great satisfaction. To die in such a community, with the consoling reflection that our children will enjoy 
the shelter of its protection and all the benefits of its just laws 
and free and noble institutions, divests even death itself, in some 
measure, of apprehension. In the natural course of human life, 
there are but a few more years allotted to me. I am withdrawn 
from public life, and never expect or desire to reappear on its surface. My chief desire and solicitude with respect to public affairs 
are concentrated in New Jersey. My chief ambition is to be remembered as one of her sons, who honestly and assiduously devoted 
himself to her welfare. There is a monitor within my breast which 
assures me that, whatever may be the views of any of my fellow-citizens in relation to me now, however harsh their judgment, how 
ever unrelenting and unforgiving their enmity and hostile their 
attitude, the time will come, when, after my poor remains shall 
repose beneath the sods of New Jersey with those of my ancestors, that my memory will be cherished with respect, and that my name 
will stand on the page of New Jersey's history, associated forever with those whose chief ambition was the promotion of her prosperity, happiness, and glory. 
</p><p>
Gentlemen, I thank you for the letter which you have addressed to me. I will long remember it as a flattering evidence of true 
regard from my fellow-citizens at Tom's River. 
</p><p>
Very faithfully, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON.
