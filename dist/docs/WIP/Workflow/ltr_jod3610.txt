MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ENCLOSED is another production of Porcupine, whose quills will stick.

With ass's ears and dirty hands."

The President appears great in Randolph's vindication throughout, excepting that he wavered about signing the treaty, which he ought not to have done 
one moment. Happy is the country to be rid of Randolph ; but where shall be found good men and true 
to fill the offices of government ? There seems to be 
a necessity of distributing the offices about the Stales 
in some proportion to their numbers ; but, in the 
southern part of the Union, false politics have struck 
their roots so deep that it is very difficult to find gentlemen who are willing to accept of public trusts, and, 
at the same time, capable of discharging them. The 
President offered the office of state to several gentlemen who declined : to Mr. Patterson, Mr. King, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> of Virginia, Mr. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina, and three others whose names 
I don t recollect. He has not been able to find any 
one to accept the war office. The expenses of living 
at the seat of government are so exorbitant, so far 
beyond all proportion to the salaries, and the sure re 
ward of integrity in the discharge of public functions 
is such obloquy, contempt, and insult, that no man of 
any feeling is willing to renounce his home, forsake 
his property and profession, for the sake of removing 
to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he is almost sure of disgrace and ruin. Where these things will end I know not. 
In perfect secrecy between you and me, I must tell 
you that I now believe the President will retire. The 
consequence to me is very serious, and I am not able, 
as yet, to see what my duty will .demand of me. I 
shall take my resolutions with cool deliberation. I 
shall watch the course of events with more critical 
attention than I have done for some time, and what 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> shall point out to be my duty, I shall pursue with patience and decision. It is no light thing 
to resolve upon retirement. My country has claims, 
my children have claims, and my own character has 
claims upon me ; but all these claims forbid me to 
serve the public in disgrace. Whatever any one may 
think, I love my country too well to shrink from danger in her service, provided I have a reasonable prospect of being able to serve her to her honor and ad 
vantage. But if I have reason to think that I have 
either a want of abilities or of public confidence to 
such a degree as to be unable to support the government in a higher station, I ought to decline it. But 
in that case, I ought not to serve in my present place 
under another, especially if that other should entertain sentiments so opposite to mine as to endanger 
the peace of the nation. It will be a dangerous crisis in public affairs if the President and Vice President should be in opposite boxes. 
</p><p>
These lucubrations must be confined to your own 
bosom. But I think, upon the whole, the probability 
is strong that I shall make a voluntary retreat, and 
spend the rest of my days, in a very humble style, 
with you. Of one thing I am very sure it would 
be to me the happiest portion of my whole life. 
I am, with unabatable affection, 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
