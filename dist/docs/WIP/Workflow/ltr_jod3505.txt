MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IT is with shame that I recollect that I have not writ 
ten you more than two or three letters these five weeks, 
and those very short. News I am afraid to write, be 
cause I never know, until it is too late, what is true. 
From last Sunday to this moment, Friday afternoon 
four o clock, we have been in a state of tormenting 
uncertainty concerning our affairs at the northward 
On Sunday, we had news from the committee of 
<a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> through <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel=''>Governor Clinton</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> of a capitulation of Burgoyne and his whole 
army. To this moment we have no express from 
Gates nor any authentic confirmation. 
</p><p>
Howe has drawn his army into the city, and Washington is at Germantown. Supplies will be cut off 
from the British army in a great measure. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., yours forever. 
</p><p>
We shall finish a plan of confederation in a few 
days. 
</p>
