DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, nothing very material occurred 
until yesterday, when I received the inclosed letters. 
The accounts contained in that marked Number One are 
truly alarming, in the present defenceless state of the 
counties of Tryon and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and especially as the 
assistance I can afford them either of men or money is 
next to nothing ; the few troops at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, &c., 
being at too great a distance, and not more than sufficient to guard the posts they occupy. I should have 
been at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> this day, had not the information from Tryon county arrived, which may make my 
presence there absolutely necessary, if it should be 
confirmed. I therefore propose remaining here until 
to-morrow, when I hope to be further informed. 
</p><p>
I wish I may be able to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, 
as I am very much wanted there, the greatest confusion having taken place in the controversy between 
the officers claiming the command in that quarter. 
Some have taken the liberty to disband troops, others 
refused to serve unless this or that particular person 
commanded. The sloop is left without either captain 
or pilot, both of which are dismissed or come away; 
much provision wasted or embezzled,, and on the 7th 
instant only one barrel of flour at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. I 
shall have an Augean stable to clean there. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose a return of the 
forces in this colony. It is doubtless imperfect, as 
I have been under a necessity of forming it out of 
the returns which were evidently so. I hope soon to 
send you a more complete one. 
</p><p>
Be assured, my General, that I shall use my best 
endeavours to establish order and discipline in the 
troops under my command. I wish I could add, that I 
had a prospect of much success in that way. It is extremely difficult to introduce a proper subordination 
amongst a people where so little distinction is kept up. 
</p><p>
Our accounts of the disposition of the Canadians and 
Canada Indians continue to be favorable, though the 
intelligence is nothing very authentic. I am your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
