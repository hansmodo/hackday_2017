DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 20th July, came safe to hand. The dissolution of 
your corps, or rather embodying it with other corps, I think a prudent 
measure. At present, I have no commands which will interfere with 
your wishes for retiring. All the cavalry corps are incorporated into 
one, and the great probability of a speedy evacuation of Charlestown 
will, I hope, render your further services unnecessary. Whether you 
</p><p>
are a supernumerary or not, don t depend on my opinion; but if those 
letters are all you have to found your claim upon, I think you are not, 
however great your sufferings, expense and trouble, since I have been 
to the Southward. I flatter myself you feel yourself happy in the 
reflection that you have aided your country in the hour of her greatest 
distress, and that the efforts have contributed to her deliverance. I 
sincerely thank you for your polite attentions to all my wishes, and for 
the very essential service which you have rendered the public and me 
in the arduous struggle. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem and regard, your most obt. humble servant, 
</p><p>
