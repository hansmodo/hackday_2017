DEAR GOVERNOR, 
</p><p>
Upon your letter, and some intelligence I received from below, 
I am fully of opinion the enemy intended a desperate effort to 
relieve <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>. I had the advice of the General 
Officers here, and we were of opinion, that to keep our force collected would be the best means of preserving our safety. As it 
is uncertain which side of the river the enemy will take, and 
having it in their power to make their election (in which we 
shall be unable to follow them), to throw our main force on the 
west side of the river would leave our principal stores a prey, 
and expose the resources of this and the Northern army to be 
cut off. 
</p><p>
I have thought it advisable to order Colonel Brinkerhoff's regiment immediately to march and join you ; and, should the enemy 
succeed in weighing the chevaux-de-frise, and proceed up the 
river, I should think it advisable for you to proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> 
with despatch ; and, should the number of cannon you have incumber your march, you will convey as many of them as you 
shall think proper to some place of safety, and proceed on with 
the rest. The militia of Connecticut, I hear, are coming in. I 
shall do every thing in my power to oppose the enemy, and to 
give succour to you, trusting .that, through the smiles of Heaven, 
we shall yet be free. With great esteem and respect, 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
