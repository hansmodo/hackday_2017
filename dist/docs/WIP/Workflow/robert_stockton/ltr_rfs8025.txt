HEAD-QUARTERS, <a href='/results.php?city=san diego' rel='city origin'>SAN DIEGO</a>, <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a> [<a href='/results.php?year=1846' rel="origin">1846</a>] <a rel='day origin' value='3'>3</a>, 6 o clock P.M. 
</p><p>
SIR : I have this moment received your note of yesterday by Mr. Stokes, and have ordered <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, with a detachment of mounted riflemen and a field-piece, to proceed to your camp with out delay. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a> is well informed in relation to the present state of things in California, and will give you all needful information. I need not, therefore, detain him by saying any thing on the subject. 
</p><p>
I will merely say that I have this evening received information, by two deserters from the rebel camp, of the arrival of an additional force in this neighbourhood of one hundred men, which, in 
addition to the force previously here, makes their number about one hundred and fifty. 
</p><p>
I send with <a href='/results.php?tla=ahg' rel='colleague met'>Captain Gillespie</a>, as a guide, one of the deserters, that you may make inquiries of him, and, if you see fit, endeavour to surprise them. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, Commander-in-chief 
</p><p>
and Governor of the Territory of California. 
</p><p>
To BRIGADIER-GENERAL KEARNEY, 
</p><p>
United States Army.
