SIR: I have sent <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Major Fremont</a> to the North to see how many men he could recruit, with a view to embark them for Mazatlan or Acapulco, where, if possible, I intend to land and fight our way as far on to the city of Mexico as I can. 
</p><p>
With this object in view, your orders of this date, in relation to having the squadron in such places as may enable me to get them 
together as soon as possible, are given. 
</p><p>
You will, on your arrival on the coast, get all the information you can in reference to this matter. I would that we might shake hands with <a href='/results.php?tla=zat' rel='colleague'>General Taylor</a> at the gates of Mexico. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. STOCKTON, Commodore, c.
