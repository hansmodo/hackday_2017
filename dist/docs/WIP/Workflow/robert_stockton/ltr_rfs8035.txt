SIR : I have the honour to inform you that the civil government of this territory is in successful operation, that <a href='/results.php?tla=jhf' rel='colleague'>Colonel Fremont</a> is acting as governor and 
Colonel Russell as secretary, and that I am again on board of the Congress, preparing her for the coast of Mexico. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant Gray, who is charged with my despatches, has been my aid-de camp, and has done his duty with great good conduct and gallantry. 
</p><p>
He is the officer whom I sent to relieve <a href='/results.php?tla=swk' rel='colleague'>General Kearney</a> from his perilous condition after his defeat at San Pasqual, and deserves the consideration of the department. 
</p><p>
He will be able to give you the particulars of that unfortunate and disastrous affair. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, Commodore, &c. 
</p><p>
To the Hon. George Bancroft,

Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.
