SIR: I herewith enclose to you your commission as military commandant of this department. 
</p><p>
Martial law will continue in force throughout the whole territory, until otherwise ordered by the governor of the same. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding, however, the existence of martial law, you will permit the civil officers of the government to proceed in the exercise of their proper functions, nor will you interfere with their duties, except in cases where the peace and safety of the territory requires your aid or interference. 
</p><p>
You will take care that my proclamation of the 17th be strictly observed throughout this department, except as to those persons who may be exempted by your written order from the operation of its provisions. 
</p><p>
You are authorized, whenever it can be prudently done, to give written per mission to persons known to be friendly to the government to be out them 
selves, and to send their servants out before sunrise in the morning. 
</p><p>
You are likewise authorized to grant permission, where you see tit, to persons known to be friendly, to carry arms with them, whenever it appears to you they 
stand in need of them for their own or their servants protection. 
</p><p>
I enclose to you, also, some blank commissions for prefects and alcaldes, that, 
in ease the people should fail to elect either of those officers within the jurisdiction of this department, you may fill up the blank with the name of some 
one you may think is qualified and will accept the office, affixing the date thereto, and transmitting to me at San Francisco, by the first opportunity, the name and date of all appointments made by you. 
</p><p>
Whenever opportunity offers, you will write to me as to the state of the country and the feelings of the people within this department. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON, 
Governor and Commander-in-chief. 
</p><p>
To CAPTAIN A. H. GILLESPIE, 
</p><p>
Military Commandant of the Southern Department. 
</p><p>
p. s. Sent that you may see how I have tempered the rigours of indispensable military law with the appliances of peace. 
</p><p>
R. F. STOCKTON.
