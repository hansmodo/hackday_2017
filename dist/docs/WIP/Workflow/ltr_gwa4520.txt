My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to my intentions communicated to you on 
the 15th instant, the troops destined for the southern 
quarter are now in motion. The American detachment 
is already on the west side of the Hudson. The French 
army I expect will reach the Ferry this day. Our 
march will be continued with all the despatch that 
our circumstances will admit. As it will be of great 
importance towards the success of our present enterprise, that the enemy on the arrival of the fleet should 
not have it in their power to effect their retreat, I cannot omit to repeat to you my most earnest wish, that 
the land and naval forces, which you will have with 
you, may so combine their operations, that the British 
army may not be able to escape. The particular mode 
of doing this I shall not at this distance attempt to 
dictate. Your own knowledge of the country, from 
your long continuance in it, and the various and extended movements, which you have made, have given 
you great opportunities for observation ; of which I am persuaded your military genius and judgment will leave you to make the best improvement. You will, 
my dear Marquis, keep me constantly advised of every important event respecting the enemy or yourself. 
</p><p>
I am. Sec. 
</p><p>
P. S. The enclosed for the Count de Grasse is 
left open for your observation, and committed to your 
care for its safe conveyance. If any water-craft can 
be procured in the country where you are, you will 
be pleased to have them sent to the Head of Elk by 
the 8th of September, to facilitate the embarkation of 
the troops who will be there by that day.
