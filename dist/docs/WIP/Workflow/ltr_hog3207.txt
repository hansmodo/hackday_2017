DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is the opinion of all the Generals that I have consulted 
with, that, in the present position and circumstances of <a href="/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="adversary">General Burgoyne's</a> army, considered with his apparent views, your army 
ought to be posted at Stillwater, and that not one moment should 
be lost in your marching them thither. Upon your arrival there, 
you will take possession of the height upon the east side, and fix 
five or six hundred men thereupon. The rest you will encamp 
at the old station. <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel=''>General Burgoyne</a> has not left the smallest 
article at any of the posts in the rear. This, I informed you of 
in my last. You will march by the shortest route to Stillwater. 
Provisions, &c., shall be provided for you there. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hog" rel="me">HORATIO GATES</a>.
