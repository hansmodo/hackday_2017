Until this morning I expected to go into the Jerseys, 
but have received orders to go to North Castle, about 
twenty-seven miles from Danbury, towards <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. . . . 
Part of my regiment are gone to <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, but are to go 
down to North Castle, to which place I have ordered those 
companies of my regiment now here. I go myself to-morrow morning by sunrise, in company with Mr. [Francis] 
Cabot, for North Castle.

I arrived at Danbury on Thursday night, the 2d of 
January, in company with <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker met'>General Lincoln</a>, who, going on 
the next day for <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, directed me to tarry here, to 
forward the militia as they arrived. Two companies in my 
regiment are not yet come in Danvers and Marblehead. 
I have been most kindly entertained here at the house 
of Mr. John McLean, a wealthy, worthy, sensible Scotch 
man, most zealously attached to the public cause of America, 
and who, with a degree of indignation, mentions the in 
gratitude of his countrymen and other foreigners, who have 
made their fortunes in America, and yet are now opposing 
its best interests, the essential interests of the country subdued and cultivated by those men whose children those 
ungrateful wretches are now striving to subject to the yoke 
of tyranny. This good man I shall ever remember with 
respect and love.
