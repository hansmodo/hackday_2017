Sir, 
</p><p>
The expedition against <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> having failed, 
my first care was to save those articles which had, 
at so much trouble and expense, been collected for 
that purpose. And here I must do justice to this 
State for their efforts on this occasion. I can, with 
truth, say that every possible preparation was made. 
</p><p>
The expectations of the people were accordingly very 
great, but not so much so as the consternation they 
were thrown into by the arrival of the British fleet 
with a reenforcement. 
</p><p>
The Marquis has doubtless communicated to your 
Excellency the project I had formed before his departure. Lord Cornwallis being then in the environs 
of Hillsborough, I proposed to Government to march 
with the whole of the militia, and by forced marches 
cross the Roanoke, and, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, fall on his Lordship before the enemy here 
could have time to form any plan. This manoeuvre, 
I flattered myself, would at least drive Cornwallis 
from North Carolina, and probably, by obliging General Phillips to follow us with all his force, have removed the seat of war from this State. 
</p><p>
I submitted this plan to the Marquis, to General Weedon, and to Colonel Gouvion, who approved it. 
On my way to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> I met Lieutenant-Colonel 
Morris, who came directly from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. lie 
informed me that his Lordship had already begun 
to retire towards Cross Creek, and that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> wanted a reenforcement to enable him to 
pursue with vigor. This served to strengthen my 
opinion; and, as I had then upwards of four thousand 
militia together, I confined my requisition to two 
thousand men, whom I only required for thirty or 
forty days. The answer of Government to this proposition I have the honor to inclose. The perplexity 
the arrival of the reenforcement had thrown them 
into, together with the Marquis's retiring at this 
juncture to the northward, made them reject every 
idea not tending to the immediate defence of the 
State. My situation here is not the most agreeable, 
obliged to undertake the defence against three thou 
sand regular troops, with notliing to oppose to them 
hut militia, whose numbers decrease every day. Those 
who have served since the Ibeginning of the invasion 
have discharged themselves, and are not yet replaced 
by others ; in consequence of which General Muhlenberg is left on the south side of the river with only 
seven hundred men, and General Weedon on the 
north side with about six hundred men. If the enemy have any intention to penetrate the country, the 
opposition we can make will avail little. 
</p><p>
A very great evil resulting from this invasion is, 
that it stops the recruiting for the army. So long 
as a county has any militia in the field, so long that 
county is prevented from drafting; and as most of the 
counties have had part of their militia either here or 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, little or nothing has yet been 
done in the business. Only fifty-two have yet come 
in ; and of these some have already deserted. Some 
who came as substitutes have received twenty-five 
and thirty thousand pounds' for eighteen months. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss w-hat to do for arms, when 
the recruits do come in. I had reckoned on those 
by M. de Tilly; and I must entreat your Excellency 
to order them on by land, as we have not the least 
prospect of a single musket any other way. We 
shall also be much distressed for ammunition. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> presses me for a supply, whilst I can 
scarce find enough to supply the militia. The Marquis has sent one hundred thousand cartridges to 
<a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> ; these I will take care to forward to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. Your Excellency has, I presume, 
been informed that the lead mines have given out. 
This article is not now to be had here. If the Eastern States do not send us a supply, we shall be 
sadly at a loss. Powder is also scarce. A powdermill, near this, was blown up some time since, supposed by an emissary of the enemy. I imagine 
Maryland would furnish some, on application of the 
Board of War. 
</p><p>
Another important and very difficult object is, remounting the cavalry. The Assembly have passed a 
law limiting the price of horses for the cavalry at 
five thousand pounds, a price inadequate to the purchase of the meanest horse. Very indifferent horses, 
which have been impressed, have been valued from 
twenty to thirty thousand pounds and upwards. Nothing, therefore, can possibly be done till the meeting of the Assembly. The Southern army will require, at least, three hundred cavalry horses for next 
campaign. I suppose thirty guineas to have been 
the old price of such horses. Allowing now forty 
guineas, the whole will amount to twelve thousand 
guineas. The price must be limited, or the Continent 
will not be able to pay the expense of remounting 
two regiments of cavalry. I beg your Excellency's 
directions for my guide in making a proper representation to the Assembly, which meets the 10th of 
next month. Swords will also be much wanted for 
the cavalry. I have ordered six hundred to be made 
at Mr. Hunter's works, but dare not reckon on them 
in time. Cartridge-boxes are an article the State 
cannot furnish. If possible, two thousand should be 
sent immediately from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The little success I have had in creating the line 
of this State, and in furnishing the necessary supplies 
for the Southern army, induced me to request <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to call me to the army. He has, however, 
refused me, and in such a manner as to engage me, if possible, to redouble my zeal in assisting him from 
this quarter. I lament only that the invasion not 
only takes up a part of my attention, but prevents 
those succours which might otherwise be expected. 
The number of troops of this State diminishes greatly. When I first arrived here, Colonel Buford had 
five hundred men with him. Since then, I have 
sent from hence eight hundred rank and file, exclusive of sergeants, music, waiters, and wagoners ; and, 
by Colonel Morris's account, they have not now 
more than seven hundred men in the field. Some 
speedy and effectual measures must be taken to stop 
such desertion, or it will be in vain to raise men at 
such an expense. 
</p><p>
I shall be much obliged to your Excellency to order the Commissary of Prisoners to send me, as soon 
as possible, a list of the southern officers exchanged, 
that I may order them to join. Many refuse to act, 
from not having received official accounts of their 
being exchanged. I inclose to your Excellency a representation of the officers of the Virginia line against 
General Weedon. the propriety of which Congress and 
your Excellency will judge. A copy has been sent 
to the Board of War. The enemy, in <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
are busied in strengthening their works, and in building boats. They have, also, some parties in Princess 
Ann, and about five hundred men in Norfolk. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.,
