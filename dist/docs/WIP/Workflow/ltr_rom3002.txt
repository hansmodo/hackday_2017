SIR, 
</p><p>
I was honored with your favor of yesterday by 
Mr. Ho well, late last night, and, ever solicitous to 
comply with your requisitions, I am up very early 
this morning to despatch a supply of fifty thousand 
dollars to your Excellency. You will receive that 
sum with this letter; but it will not be got away so 
early as I could wish, for none concerned in this 
movement, except myself, are up. I shall rouse them 
immediately. It gives me great pleasure that you have engaged the troops to continue, and if further 
occasional supplies of money are necessary, you may 
depend on my exertions either in a public or private capacity. 
</p><p>
The year <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a> is over. I am heartily glad of it, 
and hope you nor America will ever be plagued with 
such another. Let us accept the success at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> 
as a presage of future fortunate events; and under 
that impression, I do most sincerely wish you a successful campaign in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>, to crown you with immortal honors, in reward of the dangers and fatigues of 
war; and that you may, for many, many years after, 
enjoy the sweets of peace and domestic happiness, in 
reward of your social virtues. With sincere esteem 
and regard, I ever am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
