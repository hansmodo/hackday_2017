DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Being just returned to Town from a little excursion, I find 
yours of the 22 d , containing a number of Queries, that would 
require a Pamphlet to answer them fully. You, however, 
desire only brief Answers, which I shall endeavour to give 
you. 
</p><p>
Previous to your Queries, you tell me that you apprehend 
his Majesty's Servants have now "in Contemplation, First, 
to relieve the Colonists from the Taxes complained of; And 
2 J ly, to preserve the Honor, the Dignity, and the Supremacy 
of the British Legislature over all his Majesty's Dominions." 
I hope your Information is good, and that what you suppose 
to be in Contemplation, will be carried into Execution, by 
repealing all the Laws that have been made for raising a 
Revenue in America, by Authority of Parliament, without 
the Consent of the People there. The Honor and Dignity 
of the British Legislature will not be hurt by such an Act of 
Justice and Wisdom. The wisest Councils are liable to be 
misled, especially in Matters remote from their Inspection. 
It is the Persisting in an Error, not the Correcting it, that 
lessens the Honor of any Man or Body of Men. 
</p><p>
The Supremacy of that Legislature, I believe, will be best 
preserved by making a very sparing use of it, never, but for 
the evident good of the Colonies themselves, or of the whole 
British Empire, never, for the partial Advantage of Britain, 
to their Prejudice: By such prudent Conduct, I imagine 
that Supremacy may be gradually strengthened, and in Time 
fully established; but otherwise, I apprehend it will be disputed, and lost in the Dispute. At present the Colonies consent and submit to it for the Regulations of general Commerce ; but a Submission to Acts of Parliament was no part 
of their original Constitution. Our former Kings governed 
their Colonies, as they had governed their Dominions in 
France, without the Participation of British Parliaments. 
The Parliament of England never presumed to interfere with 
that Prerogative, till the Time of the great Rebellion, when 
they usurped the Government of all the King's other Dominions, Ireland, Scotland, &c. The Colonies that held for the 
King, they conquered by Force of Arms, and governed after
wards as conquered Countries; but New England, having not opposed the Parliament, was considered and treated as a 
Sister-Kingdom in Amity with England, as appears by the Journals, March noth, <a href='/results.php?year=1642'>1642</a>. 
</p><p>
" i. Will not a repeal of all the duties (that on Tea excepted, 
which was before paid here on Exportation, and of course no 
new Imposition,) fully satisfy the Colonists?" 
</p><p>
Answer. I think not. 
</p><p>
"2. Your reasons for that Opinion?" 
</p><p>
A. Because it is not the Sum paid in that Duty on Tea, 
that is complained of as a burthen, but the Principle of the 
Act expressed in the preamble ; viz. that those Duties were 
laid for the better Support of Government, and the Administration of Justice, in the Colonies. This the Colonists think 
unnecessary, unjust, and dangerous to their most important 
Rights. Unnecessary, because in all the Colonies (two or 
three new ones are excepted) 2 Government and the Administration of Justice were, and always had been, well supported 
without any Charge to Britain; unjust, as it has made such 
Colonies liable to pay such Charge for others, in which they 
had no Concern or Interest ; dangerous, as such Mode of raising Money for those Purposes tended to render their Assemblies useless ; for, if a Revenue could be raised in the Colonies 
for all the Purposes of Government by Act of Parliament, 
without Grants from the People there, Governors, who do not

freedom. When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway, it is not the two 
pence lost that makes the capital outrage. Would twenty shillings have 
ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the payment of half twenty 
shillings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a slave." 
See Mr. Burke's Speeches in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>. V. 
</p><p>
2 Nova Scotia, Georgia, the Floridas, and Canada. 
generally love Assemblies, would never call them. They 
would be laid aside ; and, when nothing should depend on the 
people's good Will to Government, their Rights would be 
trampled on ; they would be treated with Contempt. 
</p><p>
Another Reason why I think they would not be satisfied 
with such a partial Repeal is, that their Agreements not to 
import till the Repeal takes place, include the whole, which 
shows that they object to the whole, and those Agreements 
will continue binding on them if the whole is not repealed. 
</p><p>
"3. Do you think the only effectual Way of composing the 
present Differences is, to put the Americans precisely in the 
Situation they were in before the passing of the late Stamp 
Act ? " 
</p><p>
A. I think so. 
</p><p>
"4. Your Reasons for that Opinion?" 
</p><p>
A. Other Methods have been tried. They have been 
rebuk'd in angry Letters. Their Petitions have been refused 
or rejected by Parliament. They have been threatened with 
the punishment of Treason by Resolves of both Houses. 
Their Assemblies have been dissolved, and Troops have 
been sent among them; but all these Ways have only exasperated their Minds and widened the Breach. Their Agreements to use no more British Manufactures have been 
strengthened; and these Measures, instead of composing 
Differences, and promoting a good Correspondence, have 
almost annihilated your Commerce with those Countries, and 
greatly endangered the national Peace and general Welfare. 
</p><p>
"5. If this last Method is deemed by the Legislature and 
his Majesty's Ministers to be repugnant to their duty, as 
Guardians of the just Rights of the Crown and of their Fellow 
Subjects, can you suggest any other way of terminating these 
Disputes, consistent with the Ideas of Justice and Propriety conceived by the King's Subjects on both sides of the Atlantic?" 
</p><p>
A. I do not see how that Method can be deemed repugnant to the Rights of the Crown. If the Americans are put 
into their former Situation, it must be by an Act of Parliament ; in the passing of which by the King, the Rights of the 
Crown are exercised, not infringed. It is indifferent to the 
Crown whether the Aids received from America are granted 
by Parliament here, or by the Assemblies there, provided 
the quantum be the same ; and it is my Opinion, that more 
will be generally granted there voluntarily, than can ever be 
exacted or collected from thence by Authority of Parliament. 
</p><p>
As to the Rights of Fellow Subjects (I suppose you mean the 
People of Britain), I cannot conceive how those will be infringed by that Method. They will still enjoy the Right of 
granting their own Money, and may still, if it pleases them, 
keep up their Claim to the right of granting Ours; a Right 
they can never exercise properly, for Want of a sufficient 
Knowledge of us, our Circumstances and Abilities, (to say 
nothing of the little Likelihood there is that we should ever 
submit to it,) therefore a Right that can be of no good Use 
to them; and we shall continue to enjoy in fact the Right of 
granting our Money, with the Opinion now universally prevailing among us, that we are free subjects of the King, and 
that Fellow Subjects of one part of his Dominions are not 
Sovereigns over Fellow Subjects in any other part. 
</p><p>
If the Subjects on the different Sides of the Atlantic have 
different and opposite Ideas of "Justice and Propriety," no 
one "Method" can possibly be consistent with both. The 
best will be, to let each enjoy their own Opinions, without disturbing them, when they do not interfere with the common Good. 
</p><p>
"6. And, if this Method were actually followed, do you not 
think it would encourage the violent and factious Part of the 
Colonists to aim at still farther Concessions from the Mother 
Country?" 
</p><p>
A. I do not think it would. There may be a few among 
them, that deserve the Name of factious and violent, as there 
are in all Countries ; but these would have little Influence, if 
the great Majority of sober, reasonable People were satisfied. 
If any Colony should happen to think that some of your Regulations of Trade are inconvenient to the general Interest of the 
Empire, or prejudicial to them without being beneficial to 
you, they will state these Matters to the Parliament in Petitions as heretofore ; but will, I believe, take no violent Steps 
to obtain what they may hope for in Time from the wisdom 
of Government here. I know of nothing else they can have 
in view ; the Notion that prevails here of their being desirous 
to set up a Kingdom or Commonwealth of their own, is, to 
my certain Knowledge, entirely groundless. 
</p><p>
I therefore think, that, on a total Repeal of all Duties, laid 
expressly for the Purpose of raising a Revenue on the People 
of America without their Consent, the present Uneasiness 
would subside; the Agreements not to import would be dissolved ; and the Commerce flourish as heretofore ; and I am 
confirmed in this Sentiment by all the Letters I have received 
from America, and by the Opinions of all the sensible People 
who have lately come from thence, Crown Officers excepted. 
</p><p>
I know, indeed, that the People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are grievously 
offended by the Quartering of Troops among them, as they 
think, contrary to Law and are very angry with the Board of 
</p><p>
Commissioners, who have calumniated them to Government ; 
but, as I suppose withdrawing of those Troops may be a Consequence of reconciliating Measures taking place; and that 
the Commission also will either be desolved, if found useless, 
or filled with more temperate and prudent Men, if still deemed 
useful and necessary; I do not imagine these Particulars 
would prevent a Return of the Harmony so much to be 
wished. 
</p><p>
"7. If they are relieved in part only, what do you, as a 
reasonable and dispassionate Man, and an equal Friend to 
both Sides, imagine will be the probable Consequences?" 
</p><p>
A. I imagine, that repealing the offensive Duties in part 
will answer no end to this Country; the Commerce will 
remain obstructed, and the Americans go on with their 
Schemes of Frugality, Industry, and Manufactures, to their 
own great Advantage. How much that may tend to the 
Prejudice of Britain, I cannot say; perhaps not so much as 
some apprehend, since she may in time find new Markets. 
But I think, if the Union of the two Countries continues to 
subsist, it will not hurt the general Interest; for whatever 
Wealth Britain loses by the Failing of its Trade with the 'Colonies, America will gain; and the Crown will receive equal 
Aids from its Subjects upon the whole, if not greater. 
</p><p>
And now I have answered your Questions as to what may 
be, in my Opinion, the Consequences of this or that supposed 
Measure, I will go a little farther, and tell you what I fear is 
more likely to come to pass in Reality. I apprehend that the 
Ministry, at least the American Part of it, being fully persuaded of the Right of Parliament, think it ought to be enforced, whatever may be the Consequences ; and at the same 
time do not believe, there is even now any Abatement of the 
Trade between the two Countries on account of these Disputes ; or that, if there is, it is small, and cannot long continue. 
</p><p>
They are assured by the Crown Officers in America, that 
Manufactures are impossible there; that the Discontented 
are few, and persons of little Consequence; that almost 
all the People of Property and Importance are satisfied, and 
disposed to submit quietly to the taxing Power of Parliament ; and that, if the Revenue Acts are continued, and those 
Duties only that are called anti-commercial be repealed, and 
others perhaps laid instead; that Power will ere long be 
patiently submitted to, and the Agreements not to import 
be broken, when they are found to produce no Change of 
Measures here. 
</p><p>
From these and similar Misinformations, which seem to 
be credited, I think it likely that no thorough Redress of 
Grievances will be afforded to America this Session. This 
may inflame Matters still more in that Country ; farther rash 
Measures there may create more Resentment here, that may 
produce not merely ill-advised and useless Dissolutions of 
their Assemblies, as last year, but Attempts to dissolve their 
Constitutions; more Troops may be sent over, which will 
create more Uneasiness; to justify the Measures of Government, your Writers will revile the Americans in your Newspapers, as they have already begun to do; treating them as 
Miscreants, Rogues, Dastards, Rebels, &c., which will tend 
farther to alienate the minds of the people here from them, and 
diminish their Affections to this Country. Possibly, too, 
some of their warm Patriots may be distracted enough to 
expose themselves by some mad Action to be sent for hither ; 
and Government here be indiscreet enough to hang them, on 
the Act of Henry the Eighth. 
</p><p>
Mutual Provocations will thus go on to complete the Separation ; and instead of that cordial Affection that once and so 
long existed, and that Harmony, so suitable to the Circumstances, and so necessary to the Happiness, Strength, Safety, 
and Welfare of both Countries; an implacable Malice and 
mutual Hatred, such as we now see subsisting between the 
Spaniards and Portuguese, the Genoese and Corsicans, from 
the same original Misconduct in the superior Governments, 
will take Place; the Sameness of Nation, the Similarity of 
Religion, Manners, and Language not in the least preventing 
in our Case, more than it did in theirs. 
</p><p>
I hope, however, that this may all prove false Prophecy, 
and that you and I may live to see as sincere and perfect a 
Friendship established between our respective Countries, as 
has so many years subsisted between Mr. Strahan and his truly affectionate old Friend, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
