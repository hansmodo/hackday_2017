Dear Rutledge, 
</p><p>
Be so kind as to forward the enclosed by the first opportunity to your brother. It is in answer to one from him to 
Messrs. <a href="/results.php?tla=jad" rel="colleague">Duane</a>, Wm. Livingston, and myself, mentioning 
the losses sustained by <a href="/results.php?tla=chl" rel="colleague">General Lee</a> in consequence of 
entering into the American service, and recommending a 
compliance with the resolution of Congress for indemnifying him. As he has doubtless written to you on the subject, 
I forbear enlarging on the propriety, policy, or justice of the 
measure. I am for my own part clear for it, and wish with 
all my heart that it may take place: I shall write to my 
colleagues on the subject. 
</p><p>
Let no considerations induce you to excuse <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> from the office of quarter-master-general. Moyland 
acted wisely and honestly in resigning. Try no new experiments : you have paid for the last. Let me repeat it — keep Mifflin. 
</p><p>
Although extremely anxious to be with you, the circumstances of this State will not admit of my leaving it. Governor Tryon has been very mischievous ; and we find our 
hands full in counteracting and suppressing the conspiracies formed by him and his adherents. 
</p><p>
What is your fleet and noble admiral doing ? What meekness of wisdom and what tender-hearted charity ! I 
can't think of it with patience. Nothing but more than lady-like delicacy could have prevailed on your august body 
to secrete the sentence they passed upon that pretty genius. I reprobate such mincing, little, zigzag ways of doing business : either openly acquit, or openly condemn. 
</p><p>
If General Lee should be at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, pray hasten 
his departure — he is much wanted at New-York. I wish our army well stationed in the highlands, and all the lower 
country desolated ; we might then bid defiance to all the further efforts of the enemy on that quarter. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Rutledge, 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
