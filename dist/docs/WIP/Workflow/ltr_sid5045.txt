Sir, 
</p><p>
I think it unnecessary to make an apology for sending you the enclosed estimates and reflections made on two of the most important and interesting subjects, and for desiring 
the same may be communicated to Congress. Should that honorable body approve of any or all of them, I shall be very lKi|)|)y, and if they should not they will excuse me for 
having given them this trouble, when they reflect, that the desire of throwing some light on these subjects has been my sole motive. 
</p><p>
The providing for the redemption of our money, and the establishment of a marine, are objects, which in my view, far exceed in the magnitude and extent of their importance, and that are at present under public consideration ; they 
greatly depend on each other, and permit me to say, all our future operations in a great degree depend on them. We 
cannot pay the interest of any considerable loan without commerce, which cannot be revived effectually without a marine force of our own, which may I am confident be formed on the enclosed plan, and be ready in a short space 
of time to act with vigor. Great Britain has long had the empire of the ocean, and in consequence the whole world has been her tributary ; her own bad policy and the present war will deprive her of that empire at this important crisis 
it depends on the measures taken by the United States, whether they shall succeed Great Britain or not in this 
extensive dominion. Reason, observation, and experience authorise me to say, there is not in the world any power so 
capable of it, and as the United States can never aim at foreign conquests, but simply to guard their own coasts, 
and to protect the commerce of their subjects, their superiority at sea can never give just cause of jealousy or offence 
to any other nation. I am confident that a fleet of forty sail, to consist of twenty such large ships as I have described, and twenty frigates, will be more than equal to this purpose, and such a fleet may be got to sea in the course 
of the coming year, if the materials wanted from Europe can be procured, which, if immediately applied for, I have not the least doubt of. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to remain, etc.

P. S. I am still without the honor of any answer to my letter of the 7th ult . 
</p><p>
November 13th.

After writing the above, my apprehension, lest I should be thought any way out of the usual course in communicating my sentiments to Congress, made me omit sending it to 
you with the enclosed, but the alarming intelligence, which I received but a day or two since, of the sentiments of my countrymen in different parts on the present situation of the 
credit of our money, the state of our finances and resources, and of the temper and disposition prevailing in consequence, has made me waive every personal consideration, 
and communicate ibis with the enclosed to Congress, and I shall count it one of the happiest occurrences of my life, if 
anything in my power will help to prevent that total loss of public as well as private credit, which I am sorry to find 
begins to be almost universally apprehended, and I fear appearances at this time are in support of such apprehensions, which though at bottom they may be ill founded, yet, 
if once generally prevailing, will. produce consequences easily foreseen. I beg leave to refer to Colonel Duer for 
the substance of the intelligence I refer to, having communicated the letters I have received to him, for as they contain many things merely personal, I could not lay them at large before Congress.
