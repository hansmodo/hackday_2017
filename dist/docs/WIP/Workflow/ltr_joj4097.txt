Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you of the 16th ultimo, I have been 
honoured with your letter of 23d, and a joint one from you 
and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>, of 25th April. 
</p><p>
Considering the importance of our commerce with Portugal, it gives me pleasure to learn that a treaty with that 
kingdom was so nearly concluded. Until our affairs shall 
be more perfectly arranged, we shall treat under disadvantages ; and therefore I am not surprised that our negotiations with Britain and Barbary are unpromising. To be 
respectable abroad, it is necessary to be so at home ; and that will not be the case until our public faith acquires more confidence, and our govermnent more strength. 
</p><p>
When or how these great objects will be attained, can scarcely be conjectured. An uneasiness prevails through 
the country, and may produce eventually the desired reformations, and it may also produce untoward events. Time 
alone can decide this and many other doubts; for nations, like individuals, are more frequently guided by circumstances, than circumstances by them.

There are some little circumstances that look as if the 
Dutch regret our having found the way to China ; and that 
will doubtless be more or less the case with every nation 
with whose commercial views we may interfere. I am 
happy in reflecting, that there can be but little clashing of 
interests between us and France, and therefore that she 
will probably continue disposed to wish us well and do us 
good ; especially, if we honestly fulfil our pecuniary engagements with her. These engagements, however, give me 
much concern. Every principle and consideration of 
honour, justice, and interest calls upon us for good faith and 
punctuality; and yet we are unhappily so circumstanced, 
that the moneys necessary for the purpose are not provided, 
nor in such a way of being provided as they ought to be. 
This is owing, not to any thing wrong in Congress, but to 
their not possessing that power of coercion without which 
no government can possibly attain the most salutary and 
constitutional objects. Excuses and palliations, and applications for more time, make bad remittances, and will 
aflbrd no inducements to our allies or others to afford us 
similar aids on future occasions. 
</p><p>
With great respect, I have the honour to be, 
Dear sir, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
