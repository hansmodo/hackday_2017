Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with your letter of the 22d ult., 
and hnmediatelv communicated it to the committee of our 
society for promoting the liberation of slaves, and protecting such as may be manumitted. They are taking proper 
measures on the occasion, and I flatter myself that our 
Legislature will interpose to prevent such enormities in 
future. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. 
The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, 
in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these 
unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to 
deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not 
to be excused. 
</p><p>
Whatever may be the issue of the endeavours of you 
and others to promote this desirable end, the reflection that 
they are prompted by the best motives affords good reasons 
for persevering in them. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
