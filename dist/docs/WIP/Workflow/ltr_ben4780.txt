DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your very judicious letter of November 26th, being communicated by me to some member of Parliament, was handed 
about among them, so that it was some time before I got it 
again into my hands. It had due weight with several, and 
was of considerable use. You will see that I printed it at length in the London Chronicle, with the merchants' letter. 
When the American affairs came to be debated in the House 
of Commons, the majority, notwithstanding all the weight of 
ministerial influence, was only sixty-two for continuing the 
whole last act; and would not have been so large, nay, I 
think the repeal would have been carried, but that the ministry 
were persuaded by Governor Bernard, and some lying letters 
said to be from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that the associations not to import 
were all breaking to pieces, that America was in the greatest 
distress for want of the goods, that we could not possibly 
subsist any longer without them, and must of course submit 
to any terms Parliament should think fit to impose upon us. 
This, with the idle notion of the dignity and sovereignty of 
Parliament, which they are so fond of, and imagine will be 
endangered by any further concessions, prevailed, I know, 
with many, to vote with the ministry, who, otherwise, on 
account of the commerce, wish to see the difference accommodated. 
</p><p>
But, though both the Duke of Grafton and Lord North 
were and are, in my opinion, rather inclined to satisfy us, 
yet the Bedford party are so violent against us, and so prevalent in the council, that more moderate measures could 
not take place. This party never speak of us but with evident 
malice; "rebels" and "traitors" are the best names they 
can afford us, and I believe they only wish for a colorable 
pretence and occasion of ordering the soldiers to make a 
massacre among us. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, the Rockingham and Shelburne people, 
with Lord Chatham's friends, are disposed to favour us if 
they were again in power, which at present they are not like 
to be; though they, too, would be for keeping up the claim 
</p><p>
of Parliamentary sovereignty, but without exercising it in 
any mode of taxation. Besides these, we have for sincere 
friends and well-wishers the body of Dissenters generally 
throughout England, with many others, not to mention 
Ireland and all the rest of Europe, who, from various motives, 
join in applauding the spirit of liberty, with which we have 
claimed and insisted on our privileges, and wish us success, 
but whose suffrage cannot have much weight in our affairs. 
The merchants here were at length prevailed on to present 
a petition, but they moved slowly, and some of them, I thought, 
reluctantly; perhaps from a despair of success, the city not 
being much in favour with the court at present. The manufacturing towns absolutely refused to move at all ; some pretending to be offended with our attempting to manufacture 
for ourselves; others saying, that they had employment 
enough, and that our trade was of little importance to them, 
whether we continued or refused it. Those, who began a 
little to feel the effects of our forbearing to purchase, were 
persuaded to be quiet by the ministerial people, who gave 
out, that certain advices were received of our beginning to 
break our agreements; of our attempts to manufacture 
proving all abortive and ruining the undertakers; of our 
distress for want of goods, and dissensions among ourselves, 
which promised the total defeat of all such kind of combinations, and the prevention of them for the future, if the government were not urged imprudently to repeal the duties. But 
now that it appears from late and authentic accounts, that 
agreements continue in full force, that a ship is actually returned from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to Bristol with nails and glass (articles 
that were thought of the utmost necessity), and that the 
ships, which were waiting here for the determination of 
Parliament, are actually returning to North America in their 
ballast, the tone of the manufacturers begins to change, and 
there is no doubt, that, if we are steady, and persevere in our 
resolutions, these people will soon begin a clamour, that much 
pains has hitherto been used to stifle. 
</p><p>
In short, it appears to me, that if we do not now persist 
in this measure till it has had its full effect, it can never again 
be used on any future occasion with the least prospect of 
success, and that, if we do persist another year, we shall 
never afterwards have occasion to use it. With sincere 
regards, I am, dear Sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
