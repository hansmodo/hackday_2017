My dear General, 
</p><p>
To one who so tenderly loves you, who so happily 
enjoyed the times we have passed together, and who 
never, on any part of the globe, even in his own 
house, could feel himself so perfectly at home as in 
your family, it must be confessed that an irregular, 
lengthy correspondence is quite insufficient. I beseech you, in the name of our friendship, of that paternal concern of yours for my happiness, not to miss 
any opportunity to let me hear from my dear General. 
</p><p>
I have been travelling through some garrison towns, 
in order to preserve the habit of seeing troops and 
their tactics. Now I am mostly at Fontainbleau, 
where the Court is residing for a few weeks. The 
inclosed letter from the Minister to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> will, 
I hope, prove agreeable to the United States. Our 
Committees will go on this winter, and I will endeavonr to propose such measures as may be thought 
advantageous. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> is a most able and respected representative, and such a man as makes me 
happy to be his Aid-de-camp. Congress have made a 
choice very favorable to their affairs. 
</p><p>
The treaty of Commerce between France and England is made, but not yet ratified. They are to treat 
each other like the most favored European nation; so 
that America is safe. Newspapers will acquaint you 
with the Dutch quarrels. It is strange to see so 
many people so angry on so small a spot, without 
bloodshed. But parties are, at the same time, supported in their claims and cramped in their motions 
by the neighbouring powers. France sides with the 
patriots. The new King of Prussia interests himself 
in behalf of the Stadtholder, his brother-in-law. And 
so does England, underhand. But the republicans are 
so strong, and the Stadtholder is such a blockhead, 
that it will turn out to the advantage of the former. 
No present appearance of a war in Germany. The 
Russians and Turks are quarrelling, but will not so 
soon make a war. The Empress is going to Krimee, 
where it is said she will meet the Emperor. She had 
given me polite hints that I should go to Petersburg. 
I have answered with a demand of a permission to 
go to Krimee, which has been granted; so that, if 
the affair of the forts, which I think must be taken, 
does not more agreeably employ me, I will set out 
in the last days of February for Krimee, and return 
by Constantinople and the Archipelago. I will refer 
to the hints given in a former letter about those 
forts, which, if timely advertised, would carry me 
quite a different, and much more pleasing, course. 
</p><p>
I have been so much affected, my dear General, and so deeply mourn for the heavy loss which the 
United States, and ourselves particularly, have had to 
support, while our great and good friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met friend'>General Greene</a>, has been snatched from a country to which 
he was an honor, that I feel a comfort in condoling 
with one who knew so well his value, and will, of 
course, so much have lamented the loss. 
</p><p>
There is, between <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a>, a 
diversity of opinion respecting the Algerines. Adams 
thinks a peace should be p urcha sed from them. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> finds it as cheap, and more honorable, to 
cruise against them. I incline to the latter opinion, 
and think it possible to form an alliance between the 
United States, Naples, Rome, Venice, Portugal, and 
some other powers, each giving a sum of money not 
very large, whereby a common armament may distress the Algerines into any terms. Congress ought 
to give <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams</a> ample powers 
to stipulate, in their names, for such a confederacy. 
</p><p>
You will be pleased to hear that I have great 
hopes to see the affairs of the Protestants in this 
Kingdom put on a better footing ; not such, by far, 
as it ought to be ; but much mended from the absurd and cruel laws of Louis XIV. 
</p><p>
I hope your jackass, with two females, and a few 
pheasants and red partridges, have arrived safe. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. My best and tenderest 
respects wait on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to 
the one who was formerly Master Tub, and now must 
be a big boy; and also to the young ladies. Be pleased to pay my affectionate compliments to George 
and his lady; to Doctor and Mrs. Sheart, Doctor Craik, Doctor Griffith, your brothers ; Mrs. Lewis ; to 
your venerable mother; to all our friends; â€” and often 
think of your most devoted friend, your adopted son, 
who, with all the affection and respect which you 
know are so deeply rooted in his heart, has the honor 
to be, my dear General, yours, 
</p><p>

P. S. A new instance of the goodness of the 
State of Virginia has been given me, by the placing 
of my bust at the Hotel de Ville of this city. The 
situation of the other bust will be the more pleasing to me, as, while it places me within the capitol 
of the State, I shall be eternally by the side of, and 
paying an everlasting homage to, the statue of my 
beloved General. 
</p><p>
I have received the hams, and am much obliged to 
that kind attention of Mrs. Washington. The first 
was introduced three days ago, at a dinner composed 
of Americans, where our friend Chastellux had been 
invited. They arrived in the best order. Madame de Lafayette and the little family beg their best respects to Mrs. Washington and yourself
