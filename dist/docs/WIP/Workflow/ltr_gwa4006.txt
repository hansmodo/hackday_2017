Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Mr. Taylor presented me the honour of your favour of the 25th ult., and gave me the pleasure of hearing that 
Mrs. Jay and yourself were well when he left New- York. Upon your safe return to your native country, after a 
long absence, and the important services you have rendered it in many interesting negotiations, I very sincerely congratulate you and your lady. 
</p><p>
It gave me great pleasure to hear of your appointment as secretary of the United States for the department of 
foreign affairs ; a happier choice in my opinion could not have been made, and I shall always rejoice at any circumstance that will contribute either to your honour, interest, or convenience. 
</p><p>
It will always give me pleasure to hear from you. Mrs. Washington joins me in respectful compliments to, and best wishes for Mrs. Jay and yourself. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington<a/>.
