Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
This serves only to enclose and explain the within State of the Commerce of Leghorn, which was given me by 
the Envoy of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a gentleman of 
universal knowledge, and a warm friend to America, and indeed to all mankind. I have the honor of his acquaintance 
in an intimate degree, and have communicated to him a memoir, setting forth the particular state of the commerce of 
America, with the history of its rise and increase, and its present importance, it being a copy of what I delivered to 
this Court. He has marked the articles generally in demand, after which he enumerates their articles for exportation, 
which in my turn I marked and observed upon, as you will see. 
</p><p>
I have only to add, that the Grand Duke has taken off all 
duties on the American commerce, to give it encouragement. This indeed is done rather privately to prevent complaint of other powers of a seeming partiality. When I add 
to this, that it is agreed on all hands that ships of war may be purchased at Leghorn ready fitted for sea, cheaper than 
in any other port in Europe, I think a good acquaintance ought to be cultivated with this State. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, k.c.
