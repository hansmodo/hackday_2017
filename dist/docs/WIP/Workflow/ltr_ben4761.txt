MRS. STEVENSON has executed your order, and sends 
the things in a bandbox directed to you. A new-fashioned 
something, that was not ready when the box was packed up, 
is enclosed in her letter.

I am now grown too old to be ambitious of such a station, 
as that which you say has been mentioned to you. 2 Repose 
is more fit for me, and much more suitable to my wishes. 
There is no danger of such a thing being offered to me, and 
I am sure I shall never ask it. But even if it were offered, 
I certainly could not accept it, to act under such instructions, 
as I know must be given with it. So you may be quite easy 
on that head.

The account you write of the growing industry, frugality, 
and good sense of my countrywomen, gives me more pleasure 
than you can imagine; for from thence I presage great advantages to our country. I should be sorry, that you are 
engaged in a business, which happens not to coincide with 
the general interest, if you did not acquaint me that you are 
now near the end of it. B. FRANKLIN.
