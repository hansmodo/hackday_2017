Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your two letters of the 
twenty-ninth and thirtieth July. I thank you for your attention to the affair of the brig Patty, and your services in that of 
the ship Laurens. I received, at the same time, a letter from Havre, dated the first of this month, and with it the copy of a 
decree, passed July twenty-seventh, upon the petition of the 
owners and crew of the privateer, le Sans Culotte, of Honfleur. 
This decree upholds the dispositions of that of May ninth, 
relative to neutral vessels, and annuls all measures which may 
contravene it. 
</p><p>
I cannot think, Sir, after all the Convention has done in this 
matter, that it has decided to break the treaty with the United 
States of America. I therefore persuade myself, that its good 
faith has been betrayed into passing the decree in question. 
In any case, it is of great moment that we should know on 
what to depend. The decree of May ninth was announced 
to me from Havre, before it was passed. The means employed to obtain it were pointed out to me ; but I persisted in believing, that such means could never succeed, the rather, as 
the interests of the French Republic seemed to me obviously 
opposed to it. The decree, however, was passed. And you 
see, Sir, that England has adopted its provisions. I have no 
doubts that Holland and Spain will imitate her example, and that 
the representations of the Ministers of the United States will 
be met by this decree of May ninth. It has been twice solemnly repealed, in consequence of the representations which I 
had the honor to make ; but it has twice been revived again, 
at the solicitation of the same persons, and to obtain the confiscation of property, which I was assured was American. 
</p><p>
I have been further assured, that the hope of the owners is 
founded solely on the want of certain formalities, required by 
the French laws&gt; but not by ours, and in themselves unimportant. I see, with regret, Sir, that great national interests thus 
become the sport of petty intrigues, and I believe the Convention will feel indignant at beholding the measures into which it 
has been led, with regard to this subject. First, a decree is 
surreptitiously obtained from it, which infringes its treaty with 
the United States, and endangers the subsistence of the people, which they are expected to furnish in a time of scarcity. 
Then this decree is modified with respect to the United States, 
in conformity with the terms of the treaty, and the principles 
of good faith. But, a few days after, these modifications are 
annulled. Better informed, the Convention re-established 
them, and notwithstanding this, some persons dared to declare 
to the tribunal, that they should again be made void before the 
thirty -first of July ; and in effect they succeeded in destroying 
them on the twenty-seventh of that month. 
</p><p>
It is for the wisdom, the justice of the Convention, Sir, to 
decide at length this great question, and if it desires to maintain the treaty, as I have every reason to believe, it will be pro 
per to declare plainly and simply, that the treaty concluded 
on the 6th of February, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, with the United States of 
America, holds good in every point ; that every resolution op 
posed to it is null, and that henceforward no decree can impugn it, unless the treaty be particularly designated. Such a 
measure, Sir, would prevent all imposition, and, by showing 
respect for the principles of good faith, would afford a new 
proof of republican integrity. I have the honor to be, &c.
