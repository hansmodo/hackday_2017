HONORED MADAM:

The enemy has not thought fit to make any attack upon us yet. 
They employed themselves yesterday in landing some men on LongIsland (a small creek parts it from Sullivan's Island), but whether it 
was meant as a feint, or whether they were to make a descent on Sullivan's Island in the rear, while the shipping batter it in front, I cannot 
determine. In either case they will be handsomely received. I, have 
just heard that a battalion of Virginia Riflemen are arrived in town; 
so that we are now very strong. We were unlucky enough yesterday 
to have a small sloop, which was bringing us powder from Eustatia, run 
aground near Stone Inlet. She was pursued by several of the men-of-war's barges, and rather than that they should make prize of her, the 
captain blew her up. The explosion was great ; perhaps you heard it at 
Sandy Hill. With my love to Harriet and Dan and my compliments 
to Mrs. Elliott and the company at Sandy Hill, I remain

Your dutiful son,
