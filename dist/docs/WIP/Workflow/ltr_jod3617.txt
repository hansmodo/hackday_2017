MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning I have your favor of the 3d, which 
raised my spirits again after the mortification of passing the whole of last week without one. 
</p><p>
Benjamin has grown very dull. No abuse no 
lies no terrors, no panics, no rant, in comparison 
of what he used to have. 
</p><p>
The subject which you think will excite all their 
feelings is well known to every body in public life, 
but is talked of by nobody but in confidence. I could name yon, however, as good federalists, and as good 
men as any, who think and say that he will retire, 
and that they would if they were he. And who 
would not? I declare upon my honor I would. After 
twenty years of such service with such success, and 
with no obligation to any one, I would retire, before 
my constitution failed, before my memory failed, be 
fore I should grow peevish and fretful, irresolute or 
improvident. I would no longer put at hazard a character so dearly earned, at present so uncontarninated, 
but liable by the weakness of age to be impaired in 
a moment. He has, in the most solemn manner, 
sworn before many witnesses at various times and on 
several occasions, and it is now, by all who are in the 
secret, considered as irrevocable as the laws of Medes and Persians. Your comments to Knox were perfectly delicate and perfectly wise. You need not tremble to think of the subject. In my opinion there is 
no more danger in the change, than there would be 
in changing a member of the senate, and whoever 
lives to see it, will own me to be a prophet. If Jay 
or even Jefferson (and one or the other it certainly 
will be) if the succession should be passed over, 
should be the man, the government will go on as well 
as ever. Jefferson could not stir a step in any other 
system than that which is begun. Jay would not 
wish it. The votes will run for three persons. Two, 
I have mentioned ; the third, being the heir apparent, 
will not probably be wholly overlooked. If Jefferson 
and Jay are President i nd Vice-President, as is not 
improbable, the other retires without noise, or cries, or 
tears to his farm. If either of these two is President 
and the other Vice-President, he retires without 
murmur or complaint to his farm forever. If this 
other should be President and Jefferson or Jay Vice- 
President, four years more, if life last, of residence 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> will be his and your portion, after 
which we shall probably be desirous of imitating the 
example of the present pair ; or if, by reason of 
strength and fortitude, eight years should be accomplished, that is the utmost limit of time, that I will 
ever continue in public life at any rate. 
</p><p>
Be of good courage therefore, and tremble not. I 
see nothing to appal me, and I feel no ill forebodings 
or faint misgivings. I have not the smallest dread of 
private life nor of public. If private life is to be my 
portion, my farm and my pen shall employ the rest 
of my days. 
</p><p>
The money of the country, the paper money is the 
most unpleasant object I see. This must have a 
remedy, and I fear it will be reserved for me to stem 
the torrent, a worse one than the western rebellion, 
or the opposition to the treaty. 
</p><p>
This is all in confidence and affection.
