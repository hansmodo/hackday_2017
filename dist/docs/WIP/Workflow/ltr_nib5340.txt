My dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your introduction of Mr Burnley, Commissioner of Texas, makes it not unnatural to confer with you on the subject of the loan which he is endeavoring to negotiate. 
</p><p>
The subject of Texas is one familiar to me since my connection in Paris, thirty three years ago, with the treaty of Louisiana, the execution of a great portion of which fell under my own personal inspection. On that subject I hold very decided opinions. But the question which now occupies my attention is this : The Minister of Texas, just arrived &amp; in this city, 
means to withdraw, formally, the proposal to enter the Union. 
So far, the embarrassments and troubles which that measure 
threatened are, for the present at least, removed. The question then becomes an open one, and it offers for consideration this point: Whether, if we are to consider the revolution 
there as complete, if this country will not permit Texas to be conquered by a new master, or reconquered by its old 
one, then it is not of great importance that her prosperity should be of our own creation, and that she should not be 
obliged to incur obligations to any other country? She now wants money to consolidate her power &amp; fix her institutions. 
Is it not better far better that she should obtain it from us than from any other power? Now I am inclined to make 
the loan. At the same time I mean to do nothing rashly 
nothing which shall not, in my judgment, be highly beneficial to our Country. But I do not wish to take any decided 
step without the opinion of some friends on whose judgment I rely. Allow me then to ask what you think of the question ? 
Do you think that Texas will maintain its independence, or that the United States would permit any power to deprive 
her of it. Do you think it would be wise to take the loan and not suffer her to owe her success to England ? 
</p><p>
If you feel any the slightest reluctance to say anything about the matter, you will of course say nothing. But if you 
feel disposed to give any opinion, let it be such as, hereafter, if I deem it useful to use your authority as confirming my 
own views, I may quote, and if necessary, make public. I mention this that you may limit, precisely, the nature &amp; extent of your communication.
