Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of 
your separate letter of the 4th instant, and also of 
your joint letter of the same date, to the heads of 
the departments. By the information from Fort Harmar, of the 17th, and Pittsburg, of the 31st, it would 
appear that the Delawares and Wyandots are committing depredations, and that they will be joined in 
the war against us. But, what is still more disagreeable, it is to be apprehended that the Senecas, mainly, 
may be in the same predicament. For a party of 
Munsey or Delaware Indians, who reside upon the 
waters of the Allegiiany, towards Lake Erie, on the 
21st ultimo, murdered nine men, women, and children, 
within twenty miles of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, on the west side of 
the Alleghany. 
</p><p>
This was on the day the Cornplanter set out from 
<a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. The inhabitants were so blindly enraged, 
as to suspect the Cornplanter and his party, and agitated plans to cut him off. Had they proceeded and 
succeeded, it would have completed the business, and 
the war would indisputably have become general. 
Lieutenant Jeflfers, of the federal troops, accompanied 
Cornplanter, and would probably have shared his fate. 
</p><p>
Every exertion must be made to prevent the Six 
Nations from joining the western Indians. The post 
at French Creek must be strengthened, and perhaps 
a party sent to protect the Cornplanter's settlements 
from the fury of the whites. Affairs being so critical 
with the Six Nations, I have judged it advisable to 
assemble them as soon as possible, in order to brighten the chain of friendship, and to prevent all jealousies. I have accordingly desired <a href='/results.php?tla=tip' rel='colleague'>Colonel Pickering</a>, who may be depended upon, to invite them to 
a meeting, at some convenient place, at an early 
day, and that, in the mean time, he should repair to 
this city for particular orders. I shall lay this subject before the Vice-President, and the other heads 
of departments to-morrow, for their approbation. 
</p><p>
The recruiting service proceeds well. I judge we 
have about three hundred regulars and levies enlisted 
in different places, to Connecticut, inclusively. One 
company of levies, well clothed, will march from <a href='/results.php?city=carlisle' rel='city'>Carlisle</a> about the 25th, and the rest as fast as recruited. The marching of the regulars will commence by 
companies, I hope by the 1st of May, and follow in succession as fast as recruited. Present appearances 
indicate that the main force will be collected by the 15th of July, as originally designed. 
</p><p>
Brigadier-General Butler was directed to have set 
off for Maryland on the 6th; but he has delayed it 
until this day. But, as the Virginia and Maryland 
levies will not have far to march, I hope they will 
be on the frontiers by the 15th or 20th of June. I 
have the honor to be, with the highest respect, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
