My dear sir 
</p><p>
I have to thank you for four letters, all very interesting &amp; very welcome. The last only requires any answer &amp; that 
I will give very explicitly. You may rely upon it that the Bank has taken its final course and that it will be neither 
frightened nor cajoled from its duty by any small drivelling gjpout relief to the country. All that you have heard on that 
subject from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is wholly without foundation. The 
relief, to be useful or permanent, must come from Congress &amp; from Congress alone. If that body will do its duty, relief will 
come if not, the Bank feels no vocation to redress the wrongs inflicted by these miserable people. Rely upon that. 
This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with 
the Bank. He is mistaken and he may as well send at Lance and engage lodgings in Arabia . . .
