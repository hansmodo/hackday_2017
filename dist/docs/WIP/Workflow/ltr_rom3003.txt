SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with yours of the 2d instant. The 
good opinion you are pleased to entertain of me, 
makes me very happy, because there is no man's 
opinion I reverence more ; and that very circumstance 
is, at the same time, the source of trouble in my 
mind, as you force me to abandon that idea of security which I was desirous of maintaining. It is 
truly lamentable, that we have never been able to 
this day to conquer that fundamental error made in 
the outset by short enlistments. It was not until 
conviction of the absolute necessity__of it, stared every 
man in the face, that frltr -wholesome measure of enlisting for three years, or during the war, could be 
carried in Congress; and since it was carried there, 
it meets with insuperable obstacles, raised by the 
former practice ; for the bounties, high wages, and 
short service, have vitiated the minds of all that class of people, and they are grown the most mercenary beings that exist. 
</p><p>
I do not confine this observation to the soldiery 
merely, but extend it to those who get their livings 
by feeding and entertaining them. These are the 
harpies that injure us much at this time. They keep 
the fellows drunk while the money holds out ; when 
it is gone, they encourage them to enlist for the 
sake of bounty, then to drinking again ; that bounty 
gone, and more money still wanted, they must enlist 
again with some other officer, receive a fresh bounty 
and get more drink, &c. This scene is actually carrying on here daily, and does immense injury to the 
recruiting service ; but still I hope our new army 
will be got together before long, at least so many as 
will enable you to put a good face towards your 
enemies ; and if that is accomplished, I think they 
will not venture this way at present. It seems to be 
their object ; and, in your situation, I really do not 
see what is to f prevent their taking possession of it, 
unless the want of stores, forage, &c., retards their 
movements, or renders it impracticable for them to 
come on. In the mean time, the public stores are 
removing, and Congress has adjourned back to this 
place, many of the members are come up, and the 
rest on the road. I do not expect they will make a 
House sooner than Monday; but your late despatches 
shall be delivered to the President as soon as he 
arrives. 
</p><p>
I wish with you, Sir, that they had complied with 
General Lee's request; and when I sent forward those despatches to <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, I wrote my sentiments to 
some of the members ; and although it would have 
been inconvenient for me, and I urged not to be 
appointed on that errand, yet I would have gone rather than he should have been disappointed. Whether they will take up the matter again, I do not
