DEAR POLLEY, 
</p><p>
I did not receive your Letter of the 26th till I came home 
late last night, too late to answer it by the Return of that 
Post. 
</p><p>
I see very clearly the Unhappiness of your Situation, 
and that it does not arise from any Fault in you. I pity you 
most sincerely. I should not, however, have thought of 
giving you Advice on this Occasion, if you had not requested 
it, believing, as I do, that your own good Sense is more than 
sufficient to direct you in every Point of Duty to others and 
yourself. If, then, I should advise you to any thing, that 
may be contrary to your own Opinion, do not imagine, that I 
shall condemn you if you do not follow such Advice. I shall 
only think, that, from a better Acquaintance with Circumstances, you form a better Judgment of what is fit for you 
to do. 
</p><p>
Now, I conceive with you, that your Aunt, both from her 
Affection to you, and from the long Habit of having you with 
her, would really be miserable without you. Her Temper, 
perhaps, was never of the best ; and, when that is the Case, 
Age seldom mends it. Much of her Unhappiness must arise 
from thence; and, since wrong Turns of the Mind, when 
confirm'd by Time, are almost as little in our Power to cure, 
as those of the Body, I think with you, that her Case is a 
compassionable one. 
</p><p>
If she had, though by her own Imprudence, brought on 
herself any grievous Sickness, I know you would think it your Duty to attend and nurse her with filial Tenderness, even 
were your own Health to be endangered by it. Your Apprehension, therefore, is right, that it may be your Duty to live 
with her, tho inconsistent with your Happiness and your 
Interest ; but this can only mean present Interest and present 
Happiness ; for I think your future, greater, and more lasting 
Interest and Happiness will arise from the Reflection, that 
you have done your Duty, and from the high Rank you will 
ever hold in the Esteem of all that know you, for having persevered in doing that Duty under so many and great Discouragements. 
</p><p>
My Advice, then, must be, that you return to her as soon 
as the Time you proposed for your Visit is expir'd ; and that 
you continue, by every means in your Power, to make the Remainder of her Days as comfortable to her as possible. Invent 
Amusements for her ; be pleas'd when she accepts of them, 
and patient when she perhaps peevishly rejects them. I 
know this is hard, but I think you are equal to it ; not from 
any Servility in your Temper, but from abundant Goodness. 
In the mean time, all your Friends, sensible of your present 
uncomfortable Situation, should endeavour to ease your 
Burthen, by acting in Concert with you, and to give her as 
many Opportunities as possible of enjoying the Pleasures of 
Society, for your sake. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more apt to sour the Temper of aged People, 
than the Apprehension that they are neglected ; and they are 
extremely apt to entertain such Suspicions. It was therefore 
that I did propose asking her to be of our late Party; but, 
your Mother disliking it, the Motion was dropt, as some 
others have been, by my too great Easiness, contrary to my 
Judgment. Not but that I was sensible her being with us might have lessen'd our Pleasure, but I hop'd it might have prevented you some Pain. 
</p><p>
In fine, nothing can contribute to true Happiness, that is 
inconsistent with Duty; nor can a course of Action, conformable to it, be finally without an ample Reward. For 
God governs ; and he is good. I pray him to direct you ; 
and, indeed, you will never be without his Direction, if 
you humbly ask it, and show yourself always ready to obey 
it. Farewell, my dear Friend, and believe me ever sincerely 
and affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
