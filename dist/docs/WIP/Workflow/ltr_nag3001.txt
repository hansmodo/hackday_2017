DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The enemy have possession of Fort Independence, 
on the heights above King's Bridge. They made their 
appearance the night before last. We had got every 
thing of value away. The bridges are cut down, and 
I gave Colonel Magaw orders to stop the road between the mountains. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to know your Excellency's mind 
about holding all the ground from King's Bridge to 
the lower lines. If we attempt to hold the ground, 
the garrison must still be reenforced; but if the garrison is to draw into Mount Washington, and only 
keep that, the number of troops on the Island is too 
large. 
</p><p>
We are not able to determine, with any certainty, 
whether those troops, that have taken post above 
King's Bridge, are the same troops or not that were 
in or about Haerlem. Several days past they clisap-peared from below, all at once, and some little time 
after about fifty boats, full of men, were seen going 
up towards Hunt's Point, and that evening the enemy 
were discovered at Fort Independence. We suspect 
them to be the same troops that were engaged in 
the Sunday skirmish. 
</p><p>
Six officers, belonging to privateers that were taken 
by the enemy, made their escape last night. They 
inform me they were taken by the last fleet that 
came in. They had about six thousand foreign troops 
on board, one quarter of which had the black scurvy, 
and died very fast. 
</p><p>
Seventy sail of transports and ships fell down to 
Red Hook. They were bound for Rhode Island, and 
had on board about three thousand troops. They also 
inform, that after the Sunday action an officer of Distinction was brought into the city, badly wounded. 
</p><p>
The ships have come up the river to their station 
again, a little below their lines. Several deserters 
from Paulus Hook have come over. They all report 
that General Howe is wounded, as did those from 
the fleet. It appears to be a prevailing opinion in 
the land and sea service. 
</p><p>
I forwarded your Excellency a return of troops at this post, and a copy of a plan for establishing magazines. I could wish to know your pleasure as to the magazines, as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
I shall reenforce Colonel Magaw with Colonel Rawlings's regiment, until I hear from your Excellency respecting the matter. 
</p><p>
The motions of the Grand Army will best deter 
mine the propriety of endeavouring to hold all the 
ground from King's Bridge to the lower lines. I shall 
be as much on the Island of York as possible, so as 
not to neglect the duties of my own department. 
</p><p>
I can learn no satisfactory account of the action 
the other day. I am, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
