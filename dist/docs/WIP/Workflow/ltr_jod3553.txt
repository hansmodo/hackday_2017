MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS morning, for the first time, was delivered me the 
resolution of Congress of the first of May, that a com 
mission and instructions should be made out to me, Dr. 
Franklin, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, to make a treaty of commerce 
with Great Britain. If this intelligence had been sent us 
by Barney, who sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> a month after 
the first of May, and has now been sailed from hence 
on his return home above a month, it would have 
saved me and others much anxiety. I am even now 
at a loss. It is of great importance that such a treaty 
should be well made. The loan in Holland must be 
attended to, and when the present one is full, another 
must be opened, which cannot be done but by me or 
my successor. There are other things, too, to be 
done in Europe of great importance. Mr. Laurens 
has leave to go home, and Mr. Dana is gone, so that 
there remain in service only <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Franklin</a>, <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Jay</a>, 
and myself. In these circumstances I must stay 
another winter. I cannot justify going home. But 
what shall I do for want of my family ? By what I 
hear, I think Congress will give us all leave to come 
home in the spring. Will you come to me this fall 
and go home with me in the spring. If you will, 
come with my dear Abby, leaving the two boys at 
Mr. Shaw's, and the house and place under the care 
of your father, Uncle Quincy, or Dr. Tufts, or Mr. Cranch. This letter may reach you by the middle of 
October, and in November you may embark, and a 
passage in November or all December will be a good 
season. You may embark for <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=amsterdam' rel='city'>Amsterdam</a>, 
or any port in France. On your arrival, you will 
find friends enough. The moment I hear of it, I 
will fly with post horses to receive you, at least ; and 
if the balloon should be carried to such perfection in 
the mean time as to give mankind the safe navigation 
of the air, I will fly in one of them at the rate of 
thirty knots an hour. This is my sincere wish. Al 
though the expense will be considerable, the trouble 
to you great, and you will probably have to return 
with me in the spring, I am so unhappy without you 
that I wish you would come at all events. You must 
bring with you at least one maid and one man servant. 
</p><p>
I must, however, leave it with your judgment. 
You know better than I the real intentions at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and can determine better than I whether it will 
be more prudent to wait until the spring. I am determined to be with you in America, or have you 
with me in Europe, as soon as it can be accomplished, 
consistent with private prudence and the public good. 
I am told that Congress intend to recall us all as soon 
as a few affairs are finished. If this should be the 
case, all will be well ; I shall go home with infinite 
pleasure. But it may be longer than you think of 
before all their necessary affairs will be despatched. 
The treaty of commerce with Great Britain must take 
time. A treaty will be wanted with Portugal and 
Denmark, if not with the Emperor and Empress. 
If you come to Europe this fall, in my opinion you 
will be glad to go home in the spring. If you come 
in the spring, you will wish to return the next fall. 
I am sure I shall. But six months of your company 
is worth to me all the expenses and trouble of the 
voyage. 
</p><p>
This resolution of Congress deserves my gratitude. 
It is highly honorable to me, and restores me my feelings, which a former proceeding had taken away. I 
am now perfectly content to be recalled whenever 
they think fit, or to stay in Europe until this business 
is finished, provided you will come and live with me. 
We may spend our time together in Paris, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, or 
the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> for six or twelve months, as the public 
business may call me, and then return to our cottage 
with contented minds. It would be more agreeable 
to my inclinations to get home, and endeavor to get 
myself and my children into a settled way, but I 
think it is more necessary for the public that I should 
stay in Europe until this piece of business is finished. 
You don t probably know the circumstances which 
attend this proceeding of Congress. They are so 
honorable to me that I cannot in gratitude or decency 
refuse. 
</p><p>
I must submit your voyage to your discretion and 
advice of your friends. My most earnest wishes are 
to see you ; but if the uncertainties are such as to 
discourage you, I know it will be upon reasonable 
considerations, and must submit. But if you postpone 
the voyage for this fall, I shall insist on your coming 
in the spring, unless there is a certainty of my going 
home to you. Congress are at such grievous expense that I shall have no other secretary than my 
son. He, however, is a very good one. He writes 
a good hand very fast, and is steady to his pen 
and his books. Write me by every ship to Spain, 
France, Holland or England, that I may know. You 
give me more public intelligence than any body. 
The only hint in Europe of this commission was from 
you to

Yours, forever,
