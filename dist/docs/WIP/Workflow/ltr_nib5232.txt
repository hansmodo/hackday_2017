My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I thank you very sincerely for your favor of the 5th 
inst. with its inclosures. . . . 
</p><p>
On the general question, I concur entirely in your views, 
which are, in fact, those which prevail in the administration 
of the Bank. Our theory is, that the Bank should studiously 
abstain from all interference in politics, &amp; there is not an 
officer of the Institution who does not know that his stand 
ing &amp; his place too, depend on his strict observance of this 
principle. 1 believe also that they have hitherto been faithful 
to it. I have never heard of any suspicion even, that any 
officer of the Bank has intermeddled with politics, except on 
one occasion, and that suspicion, I am satisfied after inquiry, 
was without foundation. 
</p><p>
In regard to Directors, the first considerations undoubtedly are, integrity, independence &amp; knowledge of business. 
</p><p>
No man should be excluded, no man should be sought, 
merely on account of his political sentiments. Nevertheless, 
in a community where broad political distinctions prevail, 
we must not be insensible to them, we must not reject, 
nor even seem to reject, any denomination of politicians, &amp; 
where we have the means of selecting persons equally competent from all parties, their political opinions ought not to be 
overlooked. Still, however, in choosing Directors, who borrow themselves &amp; who lend to others, the funds belonging to the 
Gov. and to the Stockholders, their personal independence, 
&amp; their fitness for that particular duty must be the primary 
inquiry their political preferences only a secondary concern. 
The great hazard of any system of equal division of parties 
at a Board is, that it almost inevitably forces upon you in 
competent or inferior persons, in order to adjust the numerical balance of Directors. For instance, the Board at Nashville naturally consists of the political friends of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>General Jackson</a> that at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, of the friends of <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> (tho , 
such is the fate of politicians, I am not so sure of that now) 
and this is not from any principle of political selection or exclusion, but because the best agents for managing monied 
concerns, happened to be on that side just as the best 
lawyer or the best merchant of these places, would probably be in favor of their respective candidates but if, 
with a view to redress this inequality, we were to introduce incompetent persons, the Bank might sustain serious injury. 
</p><p>
In the Branches we naturally look to the confidential officers of the Bank (the Cashier who is appointed by the Parent 
Board, and the President of the Branch) to nominate suitable 
persons to fill the vacancies as they occur by rotation, and if, after inquiring from other independent sources, we see no 
reason to distrust their judgment, we generally lean to their nomination. This is the safest general practice, because if we 
at a distance place in the Direction gentlemen without know 
ing their precise pecuniary situation, we may introduce individuals who have already borrowed too much, or wish to 
borrow too much, or who have needy friends whose claims they may urge successfully while sitting at the Board, when 
they might otherwise be resisted. In regard to the Branches in Kentucky, they have met with enormous losses not less 
perhaps than $600,000 and a great portion of this not on business loans, the legitimate object of Banking, but on accomodation paper which should never have found its way 
into the Branches. This melancholy experience has induced us to give a more commercial &amp; business-like character to 
their transactions, and they have naturally fallen into the hands of business men, who have managed their affairs very 
well. These Branches were never in so sound &amp; prosperous a state as at this moment never did business so usefully 
to the community &amp; so profitably to the Bank. Being perfectly satisfied with their progress, &amp; perceiving that the set 
of gentlemen in the Direction are nearly the same who have been there for four or five years, I have not examined their 
relation to the political parties which have grown up principally since they were first introduced into the Boards. I was 
not even aware, until I received your letter, of any political preponderance either way, in the Directions of the Branches, 
nor did I suppose it possible that they would abuse their trusts to any political object. ...
