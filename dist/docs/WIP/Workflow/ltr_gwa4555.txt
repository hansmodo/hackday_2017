My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not till the middle of February, that I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 23d of October. 
</p><p>
If you, who are at the fountain head of those great and important transactions, which have lately engrossed the attention 
of Europe and America, cannot pretend to say what will be 
their event, surely we, in this distant quarter, should be presumptuous indeed in venturing to predict it. And unwise should 
we be in the extreme, to involve ourselves in the contests of 
European nations, where our weight could be but small, 
though the loss to ourselves would be certain. lean however 
with truth aver, that this country is not guided by such a narrow 
and mistaken policy, as will lead it to wish the destruction of 
any nation, under an idea that our importance will be increased in proportion as that of others is lessened. We should 
rejoice to see every nation enjoying all the advantages, that 
nature and its circumstances would admit, consistent with civil 
liberty and the rights of other nations. Upon this ground the 
prosperity of this country would unfold itself everyday, and 
every day it would be growing in political importance.

<a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr Jefferson</a> will communicate to you such official information as we have to give, and will transmit the laws, public 
papers, &;c. 
</p><p>
I have thought it best, my dear Sir, not to let slip this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter, lest no other 
should occur to me very soon, as I am called to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a> 
by the death of my nephew, Major Washington, and am on 
the point of setting out for that place tomorrow. I need not 
tell you that this is of course a very busy moment with me. 
It will therefore account for the conciseness of this letter, by 
which however you must not measure my regard. 
</p><p>
You see me again entering upon the arduous duties of an 
important office. It is done so contrary to my intention, that 
it would require more time, than I have allowed myself, to as 
sign the reasons ; and therefore I shall leave them to your 
own suggestion, aided by the publications which you will find 
in the gazettes. I am your sincere friend and affectionate 
servant, 
</p><p>
