MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
You will learn, from the newspapers, before this 
reaches you, the situation of things here. Mr. Howe's 
army is at Chester, about fifteen miles from this town. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>'s is over the Schuylkill, awaiting 
the flank of Mr. Howe's army. How much longer 
Congress will stay is uncertain. I hope we shall not 
move until the last necessity, that is, until it shall be 
rendered certain that Mr. Howe will get the city. If 
we should move, it will be to Reading, Lancaster, 
York, Easton, or <a href='/results.php?city=bethlehem' rel='city'>Bethlehem</a>, some town in this State. 
It is the determination not to leave this State. Don t 
be anxious about me, nor about our great and sacred 
cause. It is the cause of truth and will prevail. If 
Howe gets the city, it will cost him all his force to 
keep it, and so he can get nothing else. 
My love to all friends. 
</p><p>
Yours.
