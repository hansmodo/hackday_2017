DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I acknowledged before the receipt of your favour of May 14, 
since which I have no line from you. It will be a pleasure to 
render any service to Mr. Tilghman whom you recommended. 
</p><p>
The acts passed in your winter and spring sessions I have 
not yet received, nor have I heard from Mr. Wilmot, that they 
have been presented. 
</p><p>
Lord Hillsborough, mortified by the Committee of Council's 
approbation of our grant, in opposition to his report, has 
resigned. I believe when he offered to do so, he had 
such an opinion of his importance that he did not think 
it would be accepted ; and that it would be thought prudent 
rather to set our grant aside than part with him. His colleagues in the ministry were all glad to get rid of him, and perhaps for this reason joined more readily in giving him that 
mortification. Lord Dartmouth succeeds him, who has much 
more favourable dispositions towards the colonies. He has 
heretofore expressed some personal regard for me, and I hope 
now to find our business with the Board more easy to transact. 
</p><p>
Your observations on the state of the Islands did not come 
to hand, till after Lord Rochford had withdrawn his petition. 3 
His Lordship and the promoters of it were so roasted on the 
occasion, that I believe another of the kind will not very soon 
be thought of. The Proprietor was at the expense of the 
opposition, and as I knew it would not be necessary, and 
thought it might be inconvenient to our affairs, I did not 
openly engage in it ; but I gave some private assistance, that 
I believe was not without effect. I think too that Mr. Jackson's opinion was of great service. I would lodge a 
copy of your paper in the Plantation Office against any 
similar future applications, if you approve of it. I only 
think the Island holders make too great a concession to the 
crown, when they suppose it may have a right to quitrent. 
It can have none, in my opinion, on the old grants from Indians, Swedes, and Dutch, where none was reserved. And 
I think those grants so clearly good, as to need no confirmation ; 
to obtain which I suppose is the only motive for offering such 
quitrent. I imagine, too, that it may not be amiss to affix 
a caveat in the Plantation Office, in the behalf of holders of 
property in those islands, against any grant of them that may 
be applied for, till they have had timely notice, and an opportunity of being fully heard. Mr. Jackson is out of town, 
but I shall confer with him on the subject as soon as he returns. I am ever, my dear friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
