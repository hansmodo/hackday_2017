SIR 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of 
the 19th of April, inclosing several papers; all which 
were immediately laid before Congress. 
</p><p>
The important intelligence they contain makes it 
necessary that the most vigorous measures should 
be adopted, as well to defend our troops against the 
Canadians themselves, as to insure success to the Expedition. The Congress being determined on the reduction of Quebec, and the security of that country, 
for reasons too obvious to be mentioned, have left 
nothing undone which can any ways contribute to 
that end. Whatever may be the causes of the late 
insurrection, good policy requires, that while we endeavour to prevent every thing of the kind for the future, we should also make provision in case it should 
happen. Accordingly Congress have come into sundry 
resolutions calculated to quiet the minds of the Canadians, and to remove the sources of their uneasiness 
and discontent. They have likewise ordered six more 
battalions to be sent into Canada from the army at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as you will see by the inclosed resolve. 
Whether any further additional forces will be wanted 
there, is a matter of some uncertainty with Congress. 
Should you, from your knowledge of facts, the state 
of Canada, the possibility that General Howe will 
attempt to relieve General Carleton, and, comparing 
all circumstances together, be of opinion that an additional force is still necessary, you will please to signify it to Congress, and at the same time inform 
them whether, in that case, such additional force can 
be spared from the army now at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I transmit, herewith, sundry resolves of Congress for your direction; and have the honor to be, Sir, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. The inclosed letter for Commodore Hopkins, I leave unsealed for your perusal only ; after which I 
beg of you the favor to seal and forward it by Fessenden, or a fresh express. I have paid Mr. Fessenden twelve dollars, which you will please to note on settlement with him.
