Your letter of the 21st ultimo arrived on the 5th 
instant, whereupon my Council being convened, amidst 
various accounts of the movements and designs of the 
enemy in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and some apprehensions of their 
hostile attack upon or invasion of this State, every 
exertion was made and making for its defence, by 
ordering the militia to be reviewed, and detachments 
to be sent to the sea-coasts, and valuable effects 
there deposited to be removed to interior parts, &c. 
</p><p>
But unfortunately, before those preparations could 
be completed, namely, on the 6th instant, a party 
under the command of the infamous Arnold, made 
wanton destruction both of lives and property in New 
London and Groton, near the harbour. Though many 
material circumstances, relative to the tragical scene, 
are not yet obtainable with such a degree of precision and certainty as might be wished, yet, according 
to the best intelligence I have been able to collect, 
it seems a number exceeding one and perhaps two 
thousand, chiefly of chosen British and foreign troops, 
landed in the morning on both sides of the harbour's 
mouth, whereof one division immediately marched up 
to, and soon took possession of the town and fortifications of New London, which were evacuated on their 
approach, as being indefensible ; whilst, on the opposite shore, the fort on Groton bank, being attacked 
by six or eight hundred men, was nobly defended 
for a considerable time by about one hundred and 
fifty men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel 
William Ledyard, who bravely repulsed the assailants 
until they suffered about one fourth part in killed 
and wounded. But, being overpowered by superior 
numbers, Colonel Ledyard, perceiving the enemy had 
gained possession of some part of the fort, and opened the gate, although he had only three of his men 
killed, thought proper to surrender himself with the 
garrison prisoners, and accordingly presented his sword 
to a British officer on the parade, who received the 
same, and immediately thrust it through that brave 
but unfortunate Commander ; whereupon the soldiery 
also pierced his body in many places with bayonets, 
and proceeded to massacre upwards of seventy of the 
officers and garrison, till, by the interposition of a 
British officer, who entered the fort too late to rescue 
the gallant officers, &c., about forty of the defenceless survivors were made prisoners, and carried off, 
exclusive of about the like number, who were wounded, and many of them dangerously. 
</p><p>
This heroic opposition on the part of the garrison, 
however, together with the increasing appearance of 
the militia, and small skirmishes between some scattering parties and advanced guards, prevented the enemy from fully executing their savage plan, and occasioned them to retreat on board in the evening with 
precipitation, after having knocked off the trunnions 
of seven guns, and consumed by fire about seventyone dwelling-houses, sixty-five stores, twenty-two barns, 
a church, court-house, and jail, together with a number of vessels, lying unrigged, by the wharves. The 
rest of the shipping in the harbour was saved by 
running up Norwich River, and several valuable 
buildings, on each shore, preserved by quenching the 
flames. 
</p><p>
The loss of property by the conflagration was, however, very great, and ruinous to many individuals, as 
also a sensible damage to the public. Yet, what is 
more to be regretted, is the unhappy fate of that 
worthy officer. Colonel Ledjard, and those brave men 
(many of whom sustained respectable characters, 
and were esteemed the flower of that town), who so 
gallantly fought and unfortunately fell with him, victims to British cruelty. I have given directions for 
procuring authenticated information of those transactions, as soon as the situation of the wounded and 
prisoners (some of whom are paroled) will admit ; 
which will be forwarded as soon as obtained. I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, your Excellency's

Most obedient and very humble servant,
