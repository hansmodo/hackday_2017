My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The sole object of the enclosed letter was to evince to you, 
that, notwithstanding your recall, you held the same place in 
my estimation that you did before it happened. I expected to 
have got the letter into Colonel Monroe s hands, before the vessel in which he sailed, had left Patapsco river ; but a fresh 
fair wind coming up, prevented its reaching him. 
</p><p>
Since my arrival at this place, I have been favored with your 
private letter of the 12th of March, enclosing the duplicate of 
the 5th of February. For both I thank you. To common 
accidents, or to the interception of letters for purposes that 
may be guessed, are to be ascribed those disappointments of 
which you complain ; for I am almost certain, that information 
of what was going forward in this country was regularly transmitted to you ; possibly, and probably, not by duplicates, 
which ought to have been the case, for the greater certainty of getting it to you. 
</p><p>
The uncertainty, when letters are not entrusted to confidential persons, or sent by special messengers, of their coming to 
hand, will restrain me from going into detail at this time. I 
shall only add, therefore, to the acknowledgment of the receipt of the above letters, that I am entirely ignorant of the 
source from whence, or the foundation on which, Major Jackson has erected the fabrics of your recall, and of your successor. Neither directly nor indirectly could he have derived them 
from me, for the best of all reasons, viz. that not until some 
considerable time after M. Fauchet had arrived in this country, did I entertain an idea of the former, or contemplate the 
latter; for until then, I had supposed you stood well with the 
persons in power. Sure I am, nothing short of evidence 
to the contrary, with the request that accompanied it, would 
have induced the measure. To Major Jackson I have never 
written a line since he left this country, nor received one from him. 
</p><p>
The prospective you have drawn is not very pleasing ; but it serves to make one more anxious for a nearer view. 
</p><p>
The affairs of this country cannot go amiss. There are so many watchful guardians of them, and such infallible guides, 
that one is at no loss for a director at every turn. But of these matters I shall say little ; if you are disposed to re 
turn to it, I will leave you to judge of them from your own observation. My primary objects, and to which I have steadily 
adhered, have been to preserve the country in peace if I can, and to be prepared for war if I cannot ; to effect the first, 
upon terms consistent with the respect which is due to our selves, and with honor, justice, and good faith to all the world. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='co-worker met friend'>Mr Jay</a>, and not <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague met'>Mr Jefferson</a>, as has been suggested to you, embarked as Envoy Extraordinary for England, about the 
middle of May.. If he succeeds, well ; if he does not, why, knowing the worst, we must take measures accordingly. I am yours, affectionately, 
</p><p>
