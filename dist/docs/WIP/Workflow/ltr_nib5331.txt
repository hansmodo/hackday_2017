My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
... I think now we are approaching the end of our 
war. The repeal of the Specie Circular was an actual surrender by the Administration but since then, they have rallied in great force on the Sub-Treasury bill which was supposed to be dead &amp; buried. The real political secret of this bill is that the most of the Adm'n . party do not like it 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a> is driving them into it in order to promote his own advancement. I think however it will be defeated. 
Then we shall come to some modification of the deposit system. What I wish to establish is that the business of the country &amp; the public revenue shall pass through Banks &amp; not thro mere receivers and this I think we shall establish at last. . . .
