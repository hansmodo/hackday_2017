DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My colleague, Mr. Drayton, having shown me, about a fortnight ago, the draft of a report which he had 
prepared, stating charges against the General Officers 
who lately abandoned <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, and flattering me 
with assurances that he would soon offer it to Congress, I delayed replying to your Excellency's favor 
of the 29th ultimo, hoping for ground to intimate 
that that business was ready to be despatched to your Excellency, for the further necessary order ; but, to 
my great mortification, it continues to be procrastinated. Some of the gentlemen of the Committee are, 
or have been, desirous of new lights. In a word, Sir, 
I am quite in opinion with those gentlemen who say, 
"the not proceeding in this matter is cruel and oppressive," although I am as well convinced the delay has not been calculated or intended to distress 
the parties affected. It has arisen from a vapid, desultory habit, which, if I am not mistaken, I have 
seen squander millions, and endanger States. I speak 
with warmth, and, I believe, with equal truth. On 
my country's account, as well as from a feeling for 
the culprit officers, I am really ashamed of our con 
duct respecting the particular affair in question. How 
ever, as I can always take a decent freedom with my 
colleague, who is really a diligent man, I will not let 
him pass a day unreminded of the necessity for bringing forward his report. I sent off a messenger to 
day, with a letter to <a href='/results.php?city=lancaster' rel='city'>Lancaster</a>, at his request, for 
collecting somewhat relative to the business, and I 
think he hinted, that when that ingredient should be 
obtained, the report would be complete. 
</p><p>
Frequent items have been given in public of the 
disagreements of our Commissioners. This day a private perusal of papers, treating on that subject, gave 
me much pain. I fear an investigation, upon the arrival of Mr. Dearie, who is every hour expected, will spread the trouble wide. I have suppressed all that 
has been written to me, and have sealed my lips, except to your Excellency and one other gentleman. I 
know all the gentlemen onder, some of them very 
intimately; know their tempers and habits, and think 
I can mark out causes ; but I can only deplore their 
impolitic, and, I was going to say, school-boy jarrings, 
and dread the consequences of a heated and injudicious discussion on this side. 
</p><p>
Wi. Late last night your Excellency's public letter of the 7th was brought to me. I shall lay it 
before Congress at 10 o clock. Lord Abingdon's protest does honor to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel=''>Mr. Morris</a>, of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; the 
merit of our resolves, of 22d April, is fairly to be 
ascribed to him. 
</p><p>
I have lately much regretted that I had it not in 
my power to transmit to your Excellency some of the 
English papers which we had received, and which, 
indeed, came originally into my own hands ; but judged it my duty to present them to the House, w T here 
they were so and so suddenly dispersed, as to 
</p><p>
deprive me of the reading even of one of them; yet 
I dare not say I will take better care another time ; 
my own duty will be to do as I have done. 
</p><p>
In order to save time, I have sent to the Secretary's office a young man to copy the resolves of 
Congress, required by your Excellency, and which 
will be found here inclosed. 1 am, with the most 
sincere regard and esteem, Sir, your Excellency's 
Much obliged, and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
