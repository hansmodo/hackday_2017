DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's letters of the 4th and 6th instant, and am 
happy in being thereby enabled to give such general 
assurances of protection to the frontier inhabitants as, 
I have reason to hope, will prevent their deserting 
their settlements. This your Excellency may be as 
sured will be done, with the utmost regard to that 
secrecy which is necessary to insure success in offensive operations ; and, therefore, the greatest care 
will be taken not to give them the most remote idea 
of any such intention. 
The Legislature, before they adjourned, empowered 
me to embody one thousand men for the defence of the 
northern and western frontiers, or such other service 
as I should judge proper to employ them in. This 
was the most they conceived the State, under its 
present distressed situation, was able to raise ; and 
the greater part of them were intended to join the 
troops to be employed in defensive operations against 
the savages. Since the rising of the Legislature, I 
have received the resolve of Congress for filling up 
the Continental battalions ; and this will put me under the necessity of taking at least one half of these 
levies for the purpose, as it would be impracticable 
to convene the Legislature in season to make any 
new provision for that service, even though our circumstances would admit of it. 
</p><p>
I do not imagine we shall be able to derive any 
considerable force from the inhabitants, whose settlements have been destroyed. Their losses and consequent distresses are so great, that it requires the ut 
most industry to support their families ; and the pay 
in the army, considering the depreciated state of our currency, would not be competent for this purpose. 
The most of their young men are already engaged in 
the Continental battalions. Some, however, from a desire of revenge for their losses, will, at all events, 
engage ; and the neighbourhoods that have been less 
distressed will furnish a considerable proportion, who, 
being as well acquainted with the country, will be 
equally serviceable. 
</p><p>
In order to deceive the enemy into a belief that 
we intend acting on the defensive only, I submit to 
your Excellency the propriety of erecting one or two 
small posts on the nearest navigable waters of the 
Susquehanna, They would not only answer the 
above purpose, but serve also as a security to the 
settlements, and, of course, induce the militia to engage in the service with greater alacrity. I am not 
sufficiently acquainted with the country to determine with certainty the particular places best calculated 
for such posts ; but, from the general idea I have of 
the country, I am led to believe that Unadilla, and 
where the Susquehanna empties out of the Lakes 
west of Cherry Valley, would be the most eligible. 
These posts might be maintained by militia, at least 
while the other troops were employed in offensive 
operations. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem and regard, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
