My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the signing of the definitive treaty.. 
and on the evacuation of New- York, which took place on 
Tuesday. Our friend <a href='/results.php?tla=gom' rel='friend met colleague'>Gouverneur Morris</a> is there. He 
has been gone about eighteen days, and I expect him back 
very soon ; he will then give you the detail, and inform you 
of such things as you may wish to know respecting any of 
your particular friends.

If Great Britain persists in refusing admittance to our 
ships in their islands, they will probably have great cause 
to repent, for I shall not be surprised to see a general prohibition to the admittance of theirs into our ports ; and if 
such a measure is once adopted, they may find it very difficult to obtain any alteration, and in that case the advantages of carrying will be much against them. Should the 
court of France pursue the same policy, we shall fall in 
with the Dutch, and probably have more connexions in 
commerce with them than with any other people. I have 
received the prints of the rise and fall of the balloon. Pray 
cannot they contrive to send passengers with a man to 
steer the course, so as to make them the means of conveyance for despatches from one country to another, or 
must they only be sent for intelligence to the moon and 
clouds ? 
We are dismissing the remains of our army, and getting 
rid of expense, so that I hope to sec the end of my engagements before next May, but I doubt whether it will be in 
my power to observe that punctuality in performing them, 
which I wish and have constantly aimed at. 
</p><p>
I am sending some ships to China, in order to encourage 
others in the adventurous pursuits of commerce, and I wish 
to see a foundation laid for an American navy. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
