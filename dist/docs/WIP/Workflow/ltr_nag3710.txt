Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the 13th of December, 
came to hand this day. It is true I came to the 
southward in expectation of meeting with difficulties; 
but they far exceed what I had any idea of 
</p><p>
This country is so extensive, and supplies are so 
difficult to obtain, that it is impossible to carry on 
the war any length of time with the militia. The 
waste of stores, and consumption of provision and forage, must ruin any nation in the universe, whose 
revenue is not greater than ours. A good army, well 
appointed and supplied, consisting of four or five 
thousand infantry, and about eight hundred or one 
thousand horse, is what is wanted for the defence of 
this country; and without which it must be inevitably ruined and lost. With such a force, I think the 
country can be defended, with the occasional aid of 
the militia, against any force the enemy can maintain in this quarter. Neither they nor we can maintain a great force in this department, unless supplies 
can be had by a water communication. The country 
is so extensive, and there are such great barrens. 
that the natural strength and resources of these States 
are unequal to the burden of maintaining a very 
large force. 
</p><p>
The militia have ravaged this quarter in such a 
manner, that it will be with the greatest difficulty we 
shall be subsisted. The want of money is a great 
difficulty we meet with in supporting the army ; but 
the want of arrangement is no less an evil than that. 
We have but a very little force in the field, and two 
thirds of them are totally unfit for duty ; and, unless 
clothing arrives soon, I must disband them. I am 
persuaded, unless the States have it in their power 
to levy, equip, and support such an army as I have 
mentioned, these States are inevitably lost. 
</p><p>
The detachment which your Excellency mentions 
as embarking at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, are arrived at Virginia, 
as I am this day informed by <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a>, and 
are almost as high up James River as Petersburg. 
We have nothing to oppose them there, except the 
militia, and about four hundred eighteen-months' men, 
as ragged and naked as the Virginia blacks. The 
enemy in this quarter are making great preparations 
for an immediate movement. Our troops are in such 
a wretched condition, that we can give them little or 
no opposition. We will do all in our power; but the 
soldiers have no spirits, and it is impossible they 
should, in their present situation. I wish the enemy 
would give us a little more time to prepare ourselves. 
However, I don't intend to be drove out of North 
Carolina if I can possibly avoid it; and, if Virginia 
will furnish the provision I have requested to be deposited upon Roanoke, we will hold one corner, at all 
events. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> wrote me, that he met with insuperable difficulties in his attempts to arrange the Virginia line. I have written to General Scott, at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, to collect the wishes and intentions of the officers in captivity. If there are as many in proportion 
to their numbers, as there are here, who wish to go 
home, there will he few left, I have had the resolutions of Congress respecting specific supplies, and 
shall make my requisitions accordingly. Inclosed is 
an extract of a letter from General Morgan, confirming the account given in his former letter, an extract of which is inclosed in my letter to go by General Duportail, who has been detained a few days 
for want of horses. 
</p><p>
It is my opinion, if the French fleet and army at 
Rhode Island could be induced to push into Chesapeake Bay, they would have it in their power to 
ruin the fleet and army with General Phillips. The 
Southern States are in a critical situation, and great 
exertions and some hazard are necessary to save 
them. This is not only my opinion, but General Duportail's. I am, with great respect. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
