SIR, 
</p><p>
The inclosed resolves are all I have in charge from 
Congress to forward at this time. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='colleague'>General Mifflin</a> having applied to Congress, in consequence of your letter to him, he has their permission to repair immediately to head-quarters, agreeably 
to his own desire. I have made him acquainted with 
this determination of Congress. 
</p><p>
In order that you may be enabled to meet General Howe upon his own ground, who has long since 
offered rewards to induce the soldiers of the American army to desert, the Congress have authorized 
you to fix on such rewards or sum of money as you 
may judge proper, to encourage deserters from the 
enemy, both horse and foot. You will, therefore, be 
pleased to carry this resolve into execution in such 
way as you may think most expedient, and best 
suited to answer the end. I have the honor to be, 
with the utmost esteem and respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
