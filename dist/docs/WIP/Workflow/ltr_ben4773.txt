</p><p>
Ax length I have found an Hour, in which I think I may 
chat with my dear good Girl, free from Interruption. 
</p><p>
The Attention you have always shown to everything you 
think agreable to me, demands my most grateful Acknowledgements. I have received the Garters you have so kindly 
knit for me ; they are of the only Sort that I can wear, having 
worn none of any kind for 20 Years, till you began to supply 
me; but besides their Usefulness, these appear to me the 
finest, neatest, and prettiest that were ever made ! 
</p><p>
Accept my heartiest Thanks, and be assured that I shall 
think as often of you in the Wearing, as you did of me in the 
Making them. 
</p><p>
The Question you ask me is a very sensible one, and I shall 
be glad if I can give you a satisfactory Answer. There are 
two Ways of contracting a Chimney ; one, by contracting the 
Opening before the Fire ; the other, by contracting the Funnel 
above the Fire. If the Funnel above the Fire is left open in its 
full Dimensions, and the Opening before the Fire is contracted ; then the Coals, I imagine, will burn faster, because 
more Air is directed through the Fire, and in a stronger 
Stream; that Air which before pass'd over it, and on each 
side of it, now passing thro it. This is seen in narrow Stove 
Chimneys, when a Sacheverell or Blower is used, which still 
more contracts the narrow Opening. But if the Funnel only 
above the Fire is contracted, then, as a less Stream of Air is passing up the Chimney, less must pass thro' the Fire, and 
consequently it should seem that the Consuming of the Coals 
would rather be checked than augmented by such Contraction. 
And this will also be the Case, when both the Opening before 
the Fire, and the Funnel above the Fire are contracted, provided the Funnel above the Fire is more contracted in Proportion than the Opening before the Fire.

So you see I think you had the best of the Argument ; and, 
as you notwithstanding gave it up in Complaisance to the 
Company, I think you had also the best of the Dispute. 
There are few, tho' convinced, that know how to give up, even 
an Error, they have been once engag'd in maintaining ; there 
is therefore the more Merit in dropping a Contest where one 
thinks one's self right ; 'tis at least respectful to those we converse with. And indeed all our Knowledge is so imperfect, 
and we are from a thousand Causes so perpetually subject to 
Mistake and Error, that Positiveness can scarce ever become 
even the most knowing; and Modesty in advancing any 
Opinion, however plain and true we may suppose it, is always 
decent, and generally more likely to procure assent. Pope's 
Rule, 
</p><p>
" To speak, tho' sure, with seeming Diffidence," 
</p><p>
is therefore a good one ; and, if I had ever seen in your Conversation the least Deviation from it, I should earnestly 
recommend it to your Observation.
</p><p>
I am, &c.
