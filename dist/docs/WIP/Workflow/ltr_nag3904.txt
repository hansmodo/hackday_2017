DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have been of opinion some time, and got intelligence last evening, 
that the enemy were preparing to come out and attack us. It seems 
the refugees are pushing the General very hard for the purpose. What 
serves to confirm me in opinion that the enemy have some offensive 
operations in view is, they have taken uncommon pains for a few days 
past to find out our position, by sending flag after flag, and by searching out and interrupting every channel through which we might get 
intelligence. The refugees are ordered to be embodied to do garrison 
duty, while the army takes the field. It may all end in smoke, but I 
seriously believe they mean to give us battle ; and as they will have all 
their force collected, so I think it prudent to draw ours to a point until 
their intentions are better understood. You will, therefore, move over 
towards Dorchester with all your force as soon as possible, and let me 
know from time to time where you are. You will leave a very small 
patrole to watch the motions of the enemy in that quarter, and to for 
ward intelligence of all matters of discovery. I would have you put 
your men in the best order for action, and send me a roll of the force 
you will be able to bring to our aid. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant,
