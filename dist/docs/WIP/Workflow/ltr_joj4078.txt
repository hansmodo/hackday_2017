Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
It was not before this morning that I was informed that 
the bearer of this letter was going to France, and to sail tomorrow ; and business and company have not till now (late 
in the evening), permitted me to sit down to write to you. 
I cannot, however, omit this opportunity of sending you a 
few lines, which, though not very interesting, will nevertheless evince my attention to a correspondence, from which 
I promise myself much pleasure as well as much information.

The removal of Congress to this place necessarily occasioned a suspension of business, and delayed their maturing 
several matters which they had under consideration. They 
have, within a few days past, made a house, and as they 
possess both talents and temper, there is reason to presume that the Union will derive advantage from their 
measures.

Advices from Kentucky inform us that they are threatened 
with an Indian war ; and there is some room to conjecture 
that such an event would not be disagreeable to our western 
neighbours, who, if they do interfere, will certainly be more 
cunning than wise. That settlement increases with a degree 
of rapidity heretofore unknown in this country, and increase 
it will, notwithstanding any attempt of anybody to prevent it. 
</p><p>
Federal ideas begin to thrive in this city, and I suspect 
in a few days to communicate to you a circumstance which 
will strongly manifest it.

Although we cannot be immediately interested in the 
war, which it is thought will take place between the emperor 
and the Dutch, yet we may be affected by its consequences, 
and, therefore, must wish to know who will, and who will 
not, probably take sides with this or that party, in case of a 
rupture. 
</p><p>
Have we any reason to flatter ourselves that you will 
encourage us to drink your wines, by permitting your islands 
to eat our bread ? or will Bordeaux (as is said) constrain 
Versailles to patronise a provincial monopoly at the expense 
of a more liberal policy ? Commercial privileges, granted 
to us by France, at this season of British ill-humour, would 
be particularly grateful; and afford conclusive evidence 
against its being the plan of the two kingdoms to restrain 
our trade to the islands. You know how uneasy we are 
under these restraints, and we confide fully in your exertions 
to remove them. I write very freely, but you are my fellow-citizen, and therefore it does not appear to me necessary to attempt to dress my ideas a la mode de Paris. 
Believe me to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
AYith great regard and esteem, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
