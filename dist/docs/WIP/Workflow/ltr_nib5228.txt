Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... 3. You ask "whether any of the branches, in 
any way whatever, except the individual votes of the Directors, interfered in the late contest." 
</p><p>
Most certainly not in the slightest degree. There is no 
one principle better understood by every officer in the Bank, 
than that, he must abstain from politics, and I have not seen 
nor heard of any one of them in any part of the Union, who 
has been engaged in this controversy. I remarked the other day a story of a person l in <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> who was arrested for 
rent, &amp; it was supposed that the agent of the Bank had done 
it to prevent his going to the Senate &amp; making a Senator of 
the U.S. friendly to <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>. I do not consider it possible that he should have had any such design, but the subject is under investigation, &amp; if he shall be found to have 
abused the power of the bank to such an unworthy purpose, 
he shall certainly never have an opportunity of repeating it. 
The course of the Bank is very clear and straight on that 
point. We believe that the prosperity of the Bank &amp; its use 
fulness to the country depend on its being entirely free from 
the control of the Officers of the Gov 1 , a control fatal to every 
Bank, which it ever influenced. In order to preserve that in 
dependence it must never connect itself with any administration &amp; never become a partizan of any set of politicians. 
In this respect I believe all the officers of the institution 
have been exemplary. The truth is that with us, it is considered that we have no concern in politics. Dean Swift, 
said you know, that money is neither, whig nor tory, and we say with equal truth, that the Bank is neither Jackson man nor an Adams man, it is only a Bank. . . .
