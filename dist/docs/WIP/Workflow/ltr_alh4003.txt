My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The proceedings at <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburgh</a>, which you will find stated 
in the enclosed paper, and other incidents in the western parts of this State, announce so determined and persevering 
a spirit of opposition to the laws, as, in my opinion, to 
render a vigorous exertion of the powers of government 
indispensable. I have communicated this opinion to the 
president, and I doubt not his impressions will accord with 
it. In this case, one point for consideration will be the 
expediency of the next circuit court's noticing the state of 
things in that quarter, particularly the meeting at <a href='/results.php?city=pittsburgh' rel='city'>Pittsburgh</a>, 
and its proceedings. You will observe an avowed object 
is to " obstruct Reoperation of the law.*' This is attempted 
to be qualified by a pretence of doing it by "every legal 
measure." But "legal measures" " to obstruct the operation of a law," is a contradiction in terms. I therefore 
entertain no doubt, that a high misdemeanor has been committed. The point, however, is under submission to the 
attorney-general for his opinion. 
</p><p>
There is really, my dear sir, a crisis in the affairs of the 
country, which demands the most mature consideration of 
its best and wisest friends. 
</p><p>
I beg you to apply your most serious thoughts to it, and 
favour me, as soon as possible, with the result of your 
reflections. Perhaps it will not be amiss for you to converse with <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a>. His judgment is sound. He has 
caution and energy. 
</p><p>
Would a proclamation from the president be advisable, 
stating the criminality of such proceedings, and warning all 
persons to abstain from them, as the laws will be strictly 
enforced against all offenders '. 
</p><p>
If the plot should thicken, and the application of force 
should appear to be unavoidable, will it be expedient for the 
president to repair in person to the scene of commotion ? 
</p><p>
These are some of the questions which present themselves. The subject will doubtless open itself in all its 
aspects to you. With real respect, and affectionate attachment, I remain, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">Alexander Hamilton</a>.
