My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 7th inst. and am rejoiced to hear that your avowed purpose 
of acting next winter in the legislature has brought out an expression of corresponding sentiments in other quarters. 
</p><p>
What should be deeply impressed on the minds of the Southern gentleman is, I think, this that the administration people mean to unite in an outcry against any Bank, &amp; 
having thus secured the cooperation of the constitutionalists in the destruction of the present Bank, they will then build 
up one of their own, leaving the Constitutionalists to be laughed at, after having been duped. The question is no 
longer open. It is a question between Chestnut St and Wall St. a question whether the Central Gov't is to have the 
command of the revenues a question between a Treasury Bank or an independent Bank.

M r Gouge l was an assistant Editor of a party newspaper 
devoted to the cause of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> &amp; opposed to the Bank. 
He has retired from the paper and this book is among the 
fruits of his leisure. The work has attracted so little notice 
that I had never seen it, tho I had observed the advertisement of it; nor have I ever heard it mentioned. In consequence of your letter, I have sent for a copy of it, and have 
run my eyes over it. Mr Gouge has no knowledge or experience of his own on the subject of which he treats, nor do I 
observe any thing either strong or original in the book, which consists of an accumulation of common place extracts such 
as any body could get together who wished to support a system of any sort. I ought not to speak so disparagingly, since 
I observe that he is very civil and complimentary to me personally, but really there does not appear to be much merit of 
his compilation. It is a book made with the scissors, &amp; what is worse, a dull pair
