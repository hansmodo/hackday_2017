MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have now before me yours of July 3. Aug. 3. Sept. 3. and 
Nov. 5. All but the last came in my Absence, which is the 
Reason they were not immediately answer'd. In yours of 
July 3 you mention some Complaisance of Lord H.V towards 
you, that show'd a Disposition of being upon better Terms. 
His Behaviour to me in Ireland corresponds exactly. We 
met first at the Lord Lieutenant's. Mr. Jackson and I were 
invited to dine there, and when we came, were shown into a 
Room, where Lord H. was alone. He was extreamly civil, 
wonderfully so to me whom he had not long before abus'd to 
Mr. Strahan, as a factious turbulent Fellow, always in Mischief, a Republican, Enemy to the King's Service, and what not. 
He entered very frankly into Conversation with us both, and 
invited us both to stop at his House in Hillsboro', as we should 
travel Northward, and urged it in so polite a Manner, that 
we could not avoid saying we would wait on him if we went 
that way. In my own Mind I was determin'd not to go that 
way, but Mr. Jackson thought himself obliged to call on his 
Lordship, considering the connection his Office forms between 
them. His Lordship dined with us at the Lord Lieut's. 
There were at Table, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker, & 
all the great Officers of State. He drank my Health & was 
otherwise particularly civil. He went from Dublin some 
Days before us, And when we were on the Road, it was 
my Purpose to have turn'd off for Armagh on a Visit to Dean 
Hamilton, let Mr. Jackson go to Hillsborough alone, and meet 
him at Belfast: But it so happen'd that where we were to 
have parted, no Post Chaise was to be had for me, nor any 
other to proceed with but that we came in, so I was oblig'd 
to go forward with Mr. Jackson to Hillsborough, and as soon 
as his Lordship knew we were arriv'd at the Inn he sent a 
Message over for us to come to the House. There we were 
detained by a <a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a> Civilities from Tuesday to Sunday. 
</p><p>
I believe I wrote you a good deal of this before from Scotland, but as I have no Copy of that Letter, I cannot easily 
avoid the Repetition. 
</p><p>
At Dublin we saw and were entertained by both Parties, 
the Courtiers & the Patriots. The latter treated me with 
particular Respect. We were admitted to sit among the 
Members in the Commons' house, Mr. Jackson as member 
of the British Parliament, & I as Member of some English 
Parliament in America. The Speaker proposed it in my 
Behalf, with some very obliging Expressions of Respect for 
my Character, and was answered by the House with a 
unanimous Aye of Consent, when two Members came out 
to me, led me in between them, and plac'd me honourably 
& commodiously. I hope our Assemblies will not fall short 
of them in this Politeness, if any Irish Member should happen to be in our Country. 
</p><p>
In Scotland I spent 5 Days with Lord Kaims at his Seat, 
Blair Drummond near Stirling, two or three Days at Glasgow, two Days at Carron Iron Works, and the rest of the 
Month in and about Edinburgh, lodging at David Hume's, 
who entertained me with the greatest Kindness and Hospitality, as did Lord Kaims & his Lady. All our old Acquaintance there, Sir Alex r Dick and Lady, Mr. MGowan, Drs. 
Robertson, Cullen, Black, Ferguson, Russel, and others, 
enquired affectionately of your Welfare. I was out three 
Months, and the Journey was evidently of great service to 
my Health. 
</p><p>
Mr. Bache had some Views of obtaining an Office in 
America, but I dissuaded him from the Application, as I 
could not appear in it, and rather wish to see all I am connected with in an Independent Situation, supported by their 
own Industry. I therefore advis'd him to lay out the Money 
he brought with him (<a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a>^ Sterling) in Goods, return and 
sit down to Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, selling for ready Money 
only, in which way I think he might, by quick Returns, get 
forward in the World. It would have been wrong for Sally 
to leave her Mother, besides incurring the Expence of such a 
Voyage. 
</p><p>
I cast my eye over Goddard's Piece against our friend Mr. Galloway, and then lit my Fire with it. I think such feeble, 
malicious Attacks cannot hurt him. 
</p><p>
The Resolution of the Board of Trade to admit for the 
future no Agents to appear before them but such as are appointed by "concurrent Act of the whole Legislature," will 
I think put an End to Agencies, as I apprehend the Assemblies will think Agents under the ministerial Influence that 
must arise from such Appointments, cannot be of much Use 
in their Colony Affairs. In truth, I think the Agents, as now 
appointed, of as much Use to the Government here as to the 
Colonies that send them, having often prevented its going 
into mistaken Measures thro' Misinformation, that must 
have been very inconvenient to itself, and would have prevented more of the same kind if they had been attended to, 
witness the Stamp and Duty Acts. I believe therefore we 
shall conclude to leave this omniscient infallible Minister to 
his own Devices, and be no longer at the Expence of sending 
any Agent, whom he can displace by a Repeal of the appointing Act. I am sure I should not like to be an Agent in 
such a suspicious Situation, and shall therefore decline serving 
under every such Appointment. 
</p><p>
Your Assembly may avoid the Dispute you seem apprehensive of, by leaving the Appointment of an Agent out of the 
Support Bill, or rather I should say the Sum for his Salary. 
The Money in my Hands will pay him (whoever he is) for 
two or three Years, in which the Measure and the Minister, 
may be changed. In the mean time, by working with a 
Friend who has great Influence at the Board, he can serve 
the Province as effectually as by an open Reception and 
Appearance. . . . 
</p><p>
. . . ' Our Friend Sir John Pringle put into my hand the 
other Day a Letter from Mr. Bowman, seeming, I thought, 
a good deal pleas'd with the Notice you had taken of his 
Recommendation. I send you a Copy of it, that you may 
see the Man has a grateful Disposition. Temple has been 
at home with us during the Christmas Vacation from School. 
He improves continually, and more and more engages the 
Regard of all that are acquainted with him, by his pleasing, 
sensible, manly Behaviour. 
</p><p>
I have of late great Debates with myself whether or not I 
shall continue here any longer. I grow homesick, and, being 
now in my 6yth Year, I begin to apprehend some Infirmity 
of Age may attack me, and make my Return impracticable. 
</p><p>
I have, also, some important Affairs to settle before my 
Death, a Period I ought now to think cannot be far distant. 
I see here no Disposition in Parliament to meddle farther in 
Colony Affairs for the present, either to lay more Duties or 
to repeal any ; and I think, tho' I were to return again, I may 
be absent from hence a Year without any Prejudice to the 
Business I am engag'd in, tho' it is not probable, that, being 
once at home I should ever again see England. I have indeed 
so many good kind Friends here, that I could spend the 
Remainder of my Life among them with great Pleasure, if 
it were not for my American connections, & the indelible 
Affection I retain for that dear Country, from which I have 
so long been in a State of Exile. My love to Betsey. I am ever your affectionate Father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
