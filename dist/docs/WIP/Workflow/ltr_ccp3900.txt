Lest my honored mother should be alarmed by hearing exaggerated 
reports of the fleet off the bar, I snatch a few minutes from the duties 
of my station to acquaint her of the particulars of it. 
</p><p>
There are not more than fifty-two vessels altogether, many of which 
are very small. I do not believe there -are above six or seven men-of-war 
and a few tenders amongst them ; the rest I take to be transports some 
with soldiers and some with provisions. They can not get over the bar 
with this wind, so that we shall have no fighting to-day. We are pre 
paring to receive them properly when they do come over. Our men 
are in fine spirits and I doubt not will behave as they ought to do on 
the occasion.

Mo watt arrived last night with an express from Gen. Lee, who is on 
his march from North Carolina to this colony with two thousand men. 
If the wind should prove unfavorable for a few days to the gentry on 
the other side the bar, he may be able to join us before an engagement, 
My brother is exceedingly well. Dr. Spence is with us. I hear the 
country militia are hurrying to town every hour.

Give my love to Harriott, Dan, Mrs. Doyly and her family; my 
compliments to Mrs. Elliott and all my friends, and believe me to be 
Your dutiful son,
