MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
Although I was at a stupid rout at the Swedish 
minister's last evening, I got home about twelve, 
and rose early this morning to get a few things 
ready to send out by Lyde. When a body has attended one of these parties, you know the whole of 
the entertainment. There were about two hundred 
persons present last evening. Three large rooms 
full of card-tables ; the moment the ceremony of 
curtseying is past, the lady of the house asks you, 
" Pray, what is your game ; whist, cribbage, or commerce ? ' And then the next thing is to hunt round 
the room for a set to make a party ; and, as the company are coming and going from eight till two in 
the morning, you may suppose that she has enough 
to employ her from room to room. The lady and 
her daughter last night were almost fatigued to 
death, for they had been out the night before till 
morning, and were toiling at pleasure for seven 
hours, in which time they scarcely sat down. I 
went with a determination not to play, but could not 
get off; so 1 was set down to a table with three 
perfect strangers, and the lady who was against me 
stated the game at half a guinea a-piece. I told 
her I thought it full high ; but I knew she designed 
to win, so I said no more, but expected to lose. It 
however happened otherwise. I won four games of 
her. I then paid for the cards, which is the custom 
here, and left her to attack others, which she did, at 
three other tables, where she amply made up her 
loss. In short, she was an old, experienced hand, 
and it was the luck of the cards rather than skill, 
though I have usually been fortunate, as it is termed ; 
but I never play when I can possibly avoid it, for I 
have not conquered the disagreeable feeling of receiving money for play. But such a set of gamblers 
as the ladies here are ! and such a life as they lead ! 
Good Heavens ! were reasonable beings made for 
this ? I will come and shelter myself in America 
from this scene of dissipation, and upbraid me whenever I introduce the like amongst you. Yet here 
you cannot live with any character or consequence, 
unless you give in some measure into the ton.

<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> is gone to accompany <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> 
into the country to some of the most celebrated gar- y 
dens. This is the first tour he has made since I first 
came abroad ; during which time we have lived 
longer unseparated than we have ever done before 
since we were married.

Adieu. Your sister,
