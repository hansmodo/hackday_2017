Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received jour favor of The loth ultimo, 
upon the subject of a report respecting a certain 
gentleman, and thank you for the freedom and candid manner of your communications. The resentment, 
discovered against the gentleman alluded to, began 
to subside before your letter came to hand ; and 
though for some time it was occasionally mentioned 
in conversation, it has lately died away, and will, I 
expect, not be revived. The report of the Committee 
not only accepted his resignation, but went further; 
and, I believe, had it been then determined, the gentleman would have been informed his services in the 
line of the army would have been dispensed with, 
that he might have leisure to attend to the settlement of his accounts. Had this step been taken, it 
is probable a resignation would have ensued, and 
perhaps a public discussion in the papers, which 
would have produced no good; and, upon the whole, 
I am well pleased the matter was carried no further than it has been. 
</p><p>
But, unacquainted as I am with antecedent circumstances, and judging from what was before me, my 
opinion was, the gentleman was justly reprehensible 
for the manner of his conduct as a servant of the 
public employed in an important office, or as a citizen embarked in the common cause of America. The 
amazing sums of money gone into that department, 
under his superintendence, about eighty millions, and, 
it is said, about thirty millions unpaid, the whole of 
which is unaccounted for, has excited uneasiness not 
only in This body, but the people at large, who call out for a settlement of the public accounts ; and although repeated endeavours have been used to bring 
the officers in this great department of the army to 
account, none have been rendered, nor any likelihood 
of bringing them to a settlement. The embezzlement 
and waste of public property, in these departments, 
have greatly contributed to enhance our debt and 
depreciate the currency; and these abuses demand 
inquiry and punishment. But I see no fair prospect 
of obtaining satisfaction for past transgressions, and 
shall be happy to find we shall be able to avoid the 
like practices in future. A reform, or an attempt to 
reform, seemed absolutely necessary for the satisfaction of the public ; and, although the new system was 
pronounced a physical impossibility in execution, others, who have served long in the army, and were of 
the Committee that made the alterations, entertained 
a contrary opinion; and they affirm the gentleman 
now in office, if he can be supported with money, 
can fully carry the new system into execution. 
</p><p>
In short, I have seen some, and been told of so 
many abuses in the Quarter-master's, Commissary's, 
and Medical departments, in the course of the last 
two years, that I candidly confess I feel a degree 
of resentment against the conduct of many in those 
departments, bordering on prejudice so nearly, that I 
have resolved to condemn no person, even in opinion, 
without sure proof of delinquency, lest I should injure the character of some honest man in the general censure, which, unhappily, is but too prevalent. 
</p><p>
What I feared for some time is at length but too 
evident, that our designs against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must 
wait for more favorable circumstances to attempt 
carrying them into execution. Perhaps something 
may, in the course of the winter, be done at the 
south, should we be in a situation to recover our 
losses there, and be in time provided with a well appointed regular army, and magazine of provisions 
laid up. It is to be hoped we shall, in the spring, 
before the enemy can be reenforced and obtain supplies, be in condition to act offensively against New 
York. Your letters of the 20th of last month, and 
of the 27th, to the States, are before a Committee, 
and will, in a day or two, be reported upon, as to 
flour and meat. The great objects of drawing forth, 
in time, a competent regular army, and laying up 
magazines, will soon come in, and I hope soon go 
through Congress, that the several States may proceed to make the necessary provisions. I shall leave 
this place on Thursday for Virginia, and mean to attend our next session of Assembly, in hopes of promoting a cession, on the part of the State, of their 
claim to the lands north-west of the Ohio, to the 
United States, which will be recommended to all the 
States having unappropriated western territory, for 
the purpose of completing the Confederation. I shall 
be glad to hear from you while there, upon any matters that may occur and you shall think proper to 
communicate. 
</p><p>
With great esteem, I am, &c.,
