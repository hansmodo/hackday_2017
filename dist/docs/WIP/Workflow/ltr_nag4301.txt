Sir, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
the returning smiles of peace, and the happy establishment of our independence. This important event 
must be doubly welcome to you, who have so successfully conducted the war, through such a variety 
of difficulties, to so happy a close. If universal respect, and the general affections of a grateful country, 
can compensate for the many painful hours which 
you have experienced in your country's cause, you 
are richly rewarded. Every heart feels, and every 
tongue confesses, the merit and importance of your 
services. The polite attention, which I have experienced since I have had the honor to serve under 
your command, claims my particular acknowledgments ; and I feel a singular satisfaction in having 
preserved your confidence and esteem through the 
whole progress of the war, notwithstanding man}'- jarring interests. 
</p><p>
This pleasing event has relieved me from a load 
of anxiety on account of this country. I was much 
perplexed about withdrawing the troops from these 
States. 
</p><p>
I wished to comply fully with the spirit of your 
orders on this subject, but was at a loss how, without involving us both in difficulties. Happily for us, 
these are removed. I have sent an express-boat to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to get your final orders respecting the 
troops, and to see if transports can be got to take 
the army to the northward, as I am anxious to get 
it away from here as early as possible. I hope this 
may find you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and that you will be 
able to return me an answer in a few days. The 
cavalry must march by land, unless the horses are 
sold here. I suppose I shall have liberty to come to 
the northward, as soon as I can make it convenient, 
where I have many calls, both of a public and private nature. I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
