Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have done myself the honour to make up three packets addressed to you, this day, containing the despatches from 
our ministers from Ghent, their instructions, and the statement of the new secretary of the treasury of his plan of taxes, and his project of a national bank.

While the proposition respecting an Indian boundary was declared to be a sine qua non, the boundary itself admitted 
of modification ; and as within it, we are called upon to relinquish only our right of pre-emption to the Indians, who 
are proprietors of 'the soil, I see no objection to it. Without such demand, good polio/ would require such relinquishment, to prevent encroachments on the Indians, and 
thereby the renewal of hostilities ; and the dispersion of our citizens over immense regions, defensible only at an 
insupportable expense, while we have so many millions of acres of good lands remaining without inhabitants.

I am disposed to believe that with less pride in rulers and ministers, and with less hatred to Great Britain in both, the British propositions might have been made the basis of 
a negotiation which, governed by wisdom and prudence, might have terminated in peace. With very great respect and esteem,

I am, dear sir, your obedient servant,
