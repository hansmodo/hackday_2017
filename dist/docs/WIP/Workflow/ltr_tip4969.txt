MY DEAR, MY AMIABLE BECKY, 
</p><p>
Although tis no more than forty-eight hours since I 
wrote you by Mr. Gary, yet yours of the 20th ultimo, this 
day received, excites anew my tenderest feelings, and compels me to begin again. . . . But, pleased as I am with this 
proof of your fond affection, I do not wish you to indulge 
such melancholy thoughts. I know tis difficult to control 
the mind. That little wanderer will often make excursions 
where wisdom would check its career, but strives in vain. 
However, tis commonly in our power to place other objects 
in view than those which lead to misery, such as business, 
amusing books, and the society of friends. All these have 
a natural tendency to withdraw the mind from the pursuit 
of objects which give it pain. But, my dear, the Christian 
rests not here, but seeks and finds relief from other views. 
The Christian grieves not as those who have no hope beyond 
the grave, but looks forward to a glorious immortality, 
where grief and care shall have no place. Let this, my 
dearest, be our support. Often have I experienced its 
powerful aid, when surrounded with difficulties, dangers, 
and distress. Other props have failed, but never my hope 
in Heaven. This, raised and animated by prayer to the 
great Supreme, has often eased my burdened soul. Prayer 
is the natural mode of converse of man with his Maker ; 
and highly should we prize the condescending grace which 
invites us to adopt it. Let gratitude warm our hearts for 
that and all other blessings, and let us never forfeit them by 
inattention or neglect. Let our confidence in God never 
fail or lessen ; for that alone can support us under the 
severest trials. Let us reflect, at the same time, on our 
own ignorance and short-sightedness, which often lead us 
to view those events as most adverse and unfortunate 
which Heaven designs for our best good, if not in this 
world, at least in a better. To the Christian every event 
will prove a benefit : if it be happy, he will highly enjoy 
it; if afflictive, it will brighten his virtues, and lead him 
forward to scenes of bliss without allay. 
Reflections of this kind, my dear, are the suggestions 
of reason and Scripture. But, I confess, tis easier to 
preach than practise the lessons of wisdom. Notwithstanding the glories which, we believe, will in another world be 
displayed, great beyond the power of the human imagination to conceive, and although the path of life is strewed 
with cares, pains, and perplexities, still we are fond of 
living, still content to postpone the enjoyment of exalted 
bliss beyond the grave. Whence arises this attachment to 
life, with all its miseries, especially when set in competition 
with perfect happiness? Is it because the first is present 
and certain, the other absent and unknown? With the 
infidel this may operate forcibly ; but why should it strongly 
affect those who believe their peace is made with Heaven ? 
Or, does it proceed from the corruption of human nature, 
from perverse inclinations? This I cannot admit. A desire 
of life is the strongest of all our passions ; and the Creator 
has, I believe, implanted none in vain. Even this fond love 
of life is necessary to man. Our existence is designed for 
the accomplishment of some noble ends, and tis usually 
lengthened to a certain period. Were we indifferent to life, 
few would live out half their days. Tortured with pain, 
or vexed with disappointment, most would cut the slender thread, and thwart the views of Providence. Hence, 
then, I conclude tis lawful to indulge this fond love of life, 
with all its reasonable enjoyments, only remembering, that 
this world is not our abiding-place ; that life, at longest, is 
but of short duration ; and that we ought to conduct our 
selves as heirs to a better inheritance. 
</p><p>
These reflections on human life need not lessen our happiness while here ; at the same time, they may well serve 
to bear us up in adversity, and prevent our souls being 
weighed down with grief, even at the most distressing 
events. With this view only have I made them. 
November 13th, morning. ... To my surprise (and 
to yours it will be), the Congress, by a resolve passed 
the 7th instant, have chosen <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a>, Colonel Harrison (<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>'s Secretary), and myself to be 
a Board of War; and, for a variety of reasons (which I 
have not time now to mention), I have concluded to accept 
the commission. One reason, however, I will tell you : I 
thought it would give ease to your anxious heart, and relieve 
my friends, particularly my mother, from all distress about 
me. This Board, I take it, will reside where Congress does. 
The office is extensive and important, and therefore my 
acceptance is with diffidence. However, I am determined to 
spare no pains to comprehend and perform the duties of it. 
I ardently hope my associates will accept. <a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>General Mifflin</a> 
is active, sensible, and of great knowledge in business, and 
my friend Colonel Harrison is one of the worthiest of the 
human race. The salary to each is, I understand, to be two 
thousand dollars a year. This is better than my present 
pay by one quarter. This, to a man without a fortune, 
deserves attention. Not that I am mercenary : everybody 
who has viewed my past life knows the contrary. But 
a wife and child strongly impress my mind with the importance of laying up something. And my views have 
extended farther. When the independency of America is 
established (as I trust it will be), a Board of War will most 
probably still exist. If, therefore, I find myself equal to 
the duties of it, and give satisfaction, I, by accepting now, 
may doubtless secure a permanent support ; and this prospect, when I think of you and your dear babe, gives me no 
small joy. Tis possible the business of the department 
may call me eastward; if not, I imagine you will be 
less impatient to see me, as being removed from the military line. . . . 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest! Heaven guard you and your infant boy.
