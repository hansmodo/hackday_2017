Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I was informed that the Senate had agreed to your 
nomination of diplomatic servants. If I know my own heart, 
this intelligence is far less agreeable to me on my own account 
than on that of the public. I am sure that a rejection, from 
whatever cause it may have arisen, would have been attributed 
to disunion in our counsels.

I find that the King of France has appointed to the office 
of Foreign Affairs a Monsieur Dumouriez, and that it is considered as a sacrifice to the Jacobins. He is a bold, determined 
man. I am not acquainted with him personally, but I know 
that he has long been seeking a place in the administration, 
and was, about six months ago, determined, if appointed one 
of the ministers, to destroy at the peril of his life the Jacobin 
and all other clubs, and to effect a change in the government. 
How far he may have changed his opinions since I really can 
not tell, but I mention this to you now, because when I know 
more I can refer to this letter and say, that by coming into office he has not changed his sentiments, if he persists in those 
his ancient determinations. If not, I will tell you, that he is 
more prudent than was supposed. And these words will in 
either case mean nothing more than is here set down for them. 
The King consulted him (as I was told by his confidential friend 
in the middle of last October) on the state of affairs, when 
M. de Montmorin when out ; but the high toned measures he 
proposed were not adopted.
