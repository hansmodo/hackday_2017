Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter, which I have the honor to enclose from 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, will, I imagine, inform you 
of the intended march of the French army towards the 
North River, and of the destination of the King's 
squadron now in the harbour of Newport, if circumstances will admit of the respective movements. I 
should be wanting in respect and confidence, were I 
not to add that our object is <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The season, 
the difficulty and expense of land transportations, and 
the continual waste of men in every attempt to reinforce the southern States, are almost insuperable objections to marching another detachment from the army 
on the North River ; nor do I see how it is possible to 
give effectual support to those States, and avert the 
evils which threaten them, while we are inferior in naval force in these seas. 
</p><p>
It is not for me to know in what manner the fleet 
of his Most Christian Majesty is to be employed in the 
West Indies this summer, or to inquire at what epoch 
it may be expected on this coast ; but the appearance 
and aid of it in this quarter are of such essential importance in any offensive operation, and so necessary to 
stop the progress of the enemy's arms at the southward, that I shall be excused, I am persuaded, for endeavouring to engage your good offices in facilitating an 
event on which so much depends. For this I have a 
stronger plea, when I assure you, that <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>General Rochambeau</a>'s opinion and wishes concur with mine, and 
that it is at his instance principally I make to you this 
address. 
</p><p>
If we are happy enough to find your Excellency in 
sentiment with us, it will be in your power to inform 
the Count de Grasse of the strength and situation of 
the enemy's naval and land force in this country, the 
destination of the French squadron under Admiral Barras, and the intentions of the allied arms if a junction 
can be formed. At present the British fleet lies within 
Block Island, and about five leagues from Point Judith. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and the Chevalier Chastellux agree perfectly in sentiment with me, that, while affairs remain as they now are, the West India fleet 
should run immediately to Sandy Hook (if there are no concerted operations), where they may be met with all the information requisite, and where most likely it will 
shut in, or cut off. Admiral Arbuthnot, and may be 
joined by the Count de Barras. An early and frequent 
communication from the Count de Grasse would lead to 
preparatory measures on our part, and be a means of 
facilitating the operation in hand, or any other, which 
may be thought more advisable. I know your goodness and your zeal for the common cause too well, to 
offer any thing more as an apology for this liberty ; and 
I persuade myself it is unnecessary for me to declare 
the respect and attachment, with which I have the 
honor to be, &,c.
