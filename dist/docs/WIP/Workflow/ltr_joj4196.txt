Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 9th by the mail which 
arrived here on the 24th inst. 
</p><p>
I have not seen Mr. Wirt's book, nor heard of the " passage" in it, of which your letter contains a copy. You think that passage, as you understand it, is not correct, and 
observe, that as I am the only man remaining alive who can perfectly correct it, " in your opinion it is my conscientious duty to do it." 
</p><p>
For your satisfaction, and pursuant to your opinion, I will proceed to give you a plain statement of facts. There 
are entries in the printed journals of Congress of <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> which 
merit attention ; and I think the extracts from that journal, which I shall introduce, afford in erences which militate 
against some of the incidents mentioned in the passage. That you may compare and examine both with the greater 
ease to yourself, I will first insert the passage, and then the extracts. 
</p><p>
"A petition to the king, an address to the people of Great Britain, and a memorial to the people of British America 
were agreed to be drawn. Mr. Lee, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, and 
others were appointed for the first ; Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> for the two last. The splendour of their 
debut occasioned <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a> to be designated by his committee to draw the petition to the king with which they 
were charged, and Mr. Lee was charged with the address to the people of England. The last was firs' reported. 
On reading it, great disappointment was expressed on every countenance, and a dead silence ensued for some minutes. 
At length it was laid on the table for perusal and consideration till the next clay ; when first one member, and then 
another arose, and, paying some faint compliment to the composition, observed that there were still certain considerations not expressed which should properly find a place in 
it. His address was therefore committed for amendment ; 
and one prepared by <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>, and oiVered by Governor Livingston, was reported and adopted with scarcely an 
alteration. These facts are stated by a gentleman, to whom 
they were communicated by <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Pendleton</a> and Mr. Harrison of the Virginia delegation (except that Mr. Harrison 
erroneously ascribed the draught to Governor Livingston), 
and to whom they were afterward confirmed by Governor Livingston himself. <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>'s draft of a petition to the 
king was equally unsuccessful, and was recommitted for 
amendment. Mr. John Dickinson (the author of the farmer's Letters) was added to the committee, ami a new 
draught prepared by him was adopted." 
</p><p>
"Tuesday, October lltk, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — Resolved unanimously; 
</p><p>
That a memorial be prepared to the people of British 
America, stating to them the necessity of a firm, united, and 
</p><p>
invariable observation of the measures recommended by 
the Congress, as they tender the invaluable rights and liberties derived to them from the laws and constitution of 
their country. 
</p><p>
" Also, that an address be prepared to the people of 
Great Britain. 
</p><p>
" Ordered, That Mr. Lee, Mr. Livingston, and <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a> 
be a committee to prepare a draught of the memorial and 
address." 
</p><p>
The committee assigned the memorial, which was first 
in order, and also deemed first in importance, to Mr. Lee. 
Mr. Livingston, who was my superior both in age and 
reputation, was desired to prepare the address. He declined it, and urged me to take it. I finally consented, and 
did write it. 
</p><p>
" Tuesday, October l&th, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The committee appointed 
to prepare the address to the people of Great Britain brought 
in a draught, which was read and ordered to lie on the table 
for the perusal of the members, and to be taken into consideration tomorrow. 
</p><p>
" Wednesday, October 19th, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The Congress resumed the consideration of the address to the people of 
Great Britain ; and the same being debated by paragraphs, 
and sundry amendments made, the same was recommitted, 
in order that the amendments may be taken in." 
</p><p>
I was present in Congress, and attended to the proposed 
amendments. Mr. Lee (one of the committee) moved that 
the draught should be recommitted for the purpose mentioned in the journal ; and for that purpose it was recommitted. The amendments were made the next day, and 
the draught was returned to Congress the ensuing morning. 
</p><p>
" Friday, October 21st, <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>. — The address to the people of Great Britain being brought in, and the amendments 
directed being made, the same was approved, and is as follows." 
</p><p>
Is it probable that the committee found il sary to assign both the memorial and the address to Mr. Lee, or 
that he would readily undertake that double task, or that 
notwithstanding his other avocations in and out of Congress, he could finish them both between the 11th October, 
when they were ordered, and the 19th, when the drai of the memorial was reported ? 
</p><p>
According to the journal, the draught of the address was 
recommitted, expressly for the purpose, and "in order that 
the amendments might be taken in." Is it probable that the 
committee did, nevertheless, lay aside that draught and 
substitute a new one ? How could they have rendered such 
a procedure reconcilable to the feelings of the writer of that 
draught, or compatible with their recent approbation of it, 
or consistent with the design and object of the recommitment ? Could any of the members have been so negligent 
of delicacy and propriety, as to propose or concur in such 
a measure ? Could the embarrassments and difficulties 
attending it have been surmounted between the Wednesday, when the address was recommitted, and the ensuing 
Friday, when (with the amendments taken in) it was read 
and approved ? 
</p><p>
The subsequent occurrences you mention have not 
escaped my recollection. I was informed, and I believe 
correctly, that one person in particular of those you specify, 
had endeavoured, by oblique intimations, to insinuate a suspicion that the address to the people of Great Britain was 
not written by me, but by Cov. Livingston. That gentleman repelled the insinuation. He knew and felt what was 
due to truth, and explicitly declared it. 
</p><p>
Those persons are dead and gone. Their design did not 
succeed, and I have no desire that the memory of it should 
survive them. As to the address or petition to the king — 
who wrote the draught that was reported and recommitted 
— how far it corresponded with the one that was adopted — 
whether Mr. Dickinson, after he was added to the committee, prepared an entire new draught, or only co-operated 
in amending the one then before the committee — are questions which you only, who have survived all the other 
members of that committee, can answer with certainty. 
</p><p>
Considering who were the members of that committee, 
viz. yourself, Mr. Lee, Mr. Johnson, <a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel='colleague'>Mr. Henry</a>, and Mr. Rutlcdge, I think the idea of a new draught cannot be correct. That*Mr. Dickinson did write the subsequent or 
second address or petition to the king, I have no reason to 
doubt. 
</p><p>
To prepare an acceptable draught of the first petition 
was no easy task. Instructions as to matters to be inserted 
in it were given to the committee : and some were proposed which occasioned much debate. You may remember 
that many of the m< mbers of that Congress were anxious 
that too much might not be done or said ; and on the other 
hand, that there were many members who were anxious 
that too little might not be done or said. Hence there 
arose and prevailed a more than ordinary degree of solicitude and watchfulness, both as to the purport of subjectmatter, and to the force and latitude of expressions. And 
hence also it may have happened, that (except the draught 
of a letter to the agents in England) every report made to 
that Congress received amendments of one kind or other, 
before they approved and adopted it. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=aba' rel=''>Mrs. Adams</a>. 
It gives me pleasure to reflect, that your friendship for me 
has from of " old"' continued steadfast, and that my estimation of it has constantly animated the attachment with which 
I have so long been, and am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
