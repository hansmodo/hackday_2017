DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I am favored with your letter of this day. I know of no way of 
reinforcing you but by Col. Hampton's corps. I will speak with the 
Governor on the subject. At present, I believe we have no spare arms; 
however, I will make more strict enquiry, and let you know. Arms are 
expected from the Northward, but they will be a long time on the road, 
if we are to judge of the future by the past. To enable me to give my 
orders respecting the cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, you must send the size of 
the calibres. Every measure should be taken to preserve the provisions, for I am very apprehensive there will be a scarcity. I thank you 
for the enemy's returns of rations drawn. I think it large, but, perhaps, their force may be greater than I imagine, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
