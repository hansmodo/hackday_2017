SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 24th I had the 
honor of receiving last evening. I dined yesterday 
with the Minister of France, and find him still determined to set out for camp to-morrow. He sets out 
at seven in the morning, and intends lodging at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. On Wednesday, he will be in camp, if no 
accident attends him ; but at what hour, cannot be 
ascertained, as the place he dines at is not yet determined on. I intend to wait upon him some time 
this morning, and learn more particularly his stages. 
Don Juan accompanies him. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for your generous and 
obliging offer. Most certain, my inclination leads me 
to a resignation. My reputation I value more than 
any advantages of gain ; and I consider it in great 
danger. I wrote your Excellency lengthy upon this 
subject yesterday, and therefore shall say but little 
upon it to-day. I intend to write to Congress to 
day, upon the subject of my apprehensions and determination ; and, if they do not give me those kinds 
of assurances, which are necessary to guard my reputation from malice and detraction. I shall insist 
upon leaving the business. The politics of Congress 
are really alarming, and the state of the finances 
astonishing ; where they will end, time only can unfold. 
</p><p>
Mr. Holker made many inquiries yesterday, respecting the temper and disposition of our army. He 
seemed desirous to know, whether peace, upon a plan of independence agreeable to the state of the alliance, would be satisfactory ; the fishery to be con 
fined to the limits of the States. This would well nigh ruin the Eastern States. Upon the whole, I 
think there have been some overtures made upon the 
subject of peace. It is said Russia on the part of 
England, and Spain on the part of France, are to 
stand mediators. This is merely conjectural. Mr. 
Jay says the Congress have no official propositions 
of peace ; but I believe it is beyond a doubt there 
have been debates upon the subject for several days 
past, particularly with regard to the fishery. 
</p><p>
I spent last evening with Governor Reed. I took 
occasion to hint that <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> was to command the western expedition. lie took the alarm at 
once, and insisted he had no hopes of success, if he 
was to direct the operations. So deep are the prejudices of human nature. I had several hours conversation with him; and, I believe, satisfied him, as 
far as is possible, that the appointment was the result of the maturest deliberation. We were in private. 
</p><p>
If I leave the Quarter-master's department, I should 
be glad of the South Carolina appointment. How 
ever, I shall wish to consult your Excellency upon 
the affair. 
</p><p>
We have an agreeable piece of intelligence from 
the eastward ; which is, that Colonel Campbell and 
thirty or forty officers, and six or eight sail of transports, bound to Europe, were taken lately, by a couple of our frigates, and carried into <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
</p><p>
I had letters, last night, from South Carolina, 
which indicate a great disgust between the State 
and the Congress. They think themselves neglected. 
There is a large number of public vessels now on 
pay in the harbour, loaded with rice, which want to 
sail ; but the State is so much soured, that they will 
not grant exclusive privileges to the Continental vessels from the embargo. The express is waiting ; I 
can only add, that I am, with esteem and affection, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant,
