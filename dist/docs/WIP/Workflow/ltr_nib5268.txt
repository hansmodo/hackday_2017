My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... I cannot doubt, whatever may be the result, that we have done well in applying at the present session. When 
we were first warned against it lest it should affect the interests of one of the candidates for the Presidency, such a course 
seemed so entirely foreign to the duties of the Bank that we could not acquiesce in it for a moment. At a later period 
when we were counselled to abandon it, lest the influence of that candidate should crush the institution; that course 
seemed equally inadmissable, and we determined, that having begun, we would go through at all hazards; and that 
it was better even to be defeated in a fair field than to retreat. Into that field you have now probably led us; and on 
you much of the fate of the institution will depend. I have 
often heard the contemporaries of <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a>, in the Congress of <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a>, speak with admiration of the talent, and tact, 
the gentleness and the firmness with which he carried the present Charter through the H of Reps, and we rely that 
the union of the same qualities will enable you to be equally successful now. . . .
