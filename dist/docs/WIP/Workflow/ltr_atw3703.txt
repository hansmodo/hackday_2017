Dear General, 
</p><p>
The most general and unhappy mutiny suddenly 
took place in the Pennsylvania line, about nine 
o'clock last night. It yet subsists. A great proportion of the troops, with some artillery, are marching 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
Every exertion has been used by the officers to 
divide them in their determination to revolt. It has 
succeeded, in a temporary manner, with near one 
half How long it will last, God knows ! I have ordered the Jersey brigade to Chatham, where the militia are also assembled, lest the enemy should take 
advantage of this alarming crisis. Indeed, the alarmguns have been fired, and the beacons kindled, 
towards <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a> ; perhaps it was occasioned 
by our unhappy affair. I am, this moment, with 
Colonels Butler and Stewart, taking horse to try to 
halt those on their march towards <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>. As a last resort, I am advised to collect them, and move 
on slowly towards Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>
What their temper may he, I cannot tell. We 
had our escapes last night. Perhaps we may he 
equally fortunate to-day. If not, adieu, my dear General, and believe me 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>

P. S. Captain Billings is killed ; Captain Talbot, 
mortally wounded ; some others are also hurt. Major Fishbourn, who carries this, will be able to give you 
a particular account of last night's and this morning's 
transactions. I am happy to inform you that not an 
officer was absent on this occasion, nor have any of 
the soldiers gone towards the enemy. Their general 
cry is, to be discharged, and that they will again enlist, and fight for America, a few excepted. General Potter and Colonel Johnson, who were eye-witnesses of the W'hole, as far as it is yet gone, go 
express to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.
