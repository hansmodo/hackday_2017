After the enemy left the Jerseys, we had reason to 
apprehend they intended to go to the eastward, or up the 
North River. This induced us to march from Middle Brook 
to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, thence to <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, thence within eighteen 
miles of King's Ferry, and thence into Smith's Clove, in a 
route that would carry us to New Windsor, where we should 
have crossed the ferry to <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>. But, having advanced 
a dozen miles into the Clove, we halted, having reason to 
doubt, from the enemy's movements and the best intelligence we could obtain, whether they were bound up the 
North River or to the eastward, or not. At length we had 
such intelligence as induced the general officers to think 
Howe intended for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. This intelligence was 
strengthened by a letter, written with Howe's own hand, to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, in which he says he is going to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. 
But he sent it out by a man who had been confined by him 
in the provost three weeks, and on whom he had no reason 
to rely. In short, it was not doubted but he sent it 
on purpose by such a messenger, that it might fall into 
our hands. The messenger, at the first guard of ours he 
met, delivered it up to the officer, and gave what other 
information he could. We had, before the receipt of 
Howe's letter, come back out of the Clove. We are now 
got back to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, and shall proceed on towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; for the bulk of the enemy's ships have sailed 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and, it is supposed, for <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>.
