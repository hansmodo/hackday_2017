Sir

Allow me again to invite your attention to the subject of turning the balances with the State Banks, in your 
favor by bringing your discounts within your income. In 
the midst of the speculations J which are abroad, combined 
with the demands for specie, prudence requires that we 
should keep within reasonable limits, and that under all 
circumstances, and at all hazards the Bank should keep 
itself secure and strong. Since the 18th of March when 
I wrote to you on the subject of your ability to do business paper falling due on or about the 1st of July, your 
discounts have increased about $700,000, a fair addition 
to your business which would be attended with no inconvenience did not an extraordinary demand for Specie which 
has arisen render the extension more hazardous by expos 
ing you to calls for Specie against which every consideration of prudence requires you to guard. It is no doubt very 
unpleasant and even painful to decline good business paper, 
but you have already by so large an increase of your discounts contributed your full share to the public accomodation and beyond a certain limit the convenience of the 
customers of the Bank however desirable it may be to pro 
mote it is only a secondary consideration when there is the 
slightest risk that by pushing the spirit of accomodation as 
to require a sudden reduction, which would more than over 
balance the facilities to a few individuals which had occasioned it. In the present state of the office the true course 
I think is, to turn over as quietly as possible to the other 
Banks, any demand which you cannot supply to let the 
diminution of your discounts, and the public revenue as it 
accumulates turn the scale in your favor with the other Banks, and then not to make sudden or very rigid demands 
on them for Specie when you feel satisfied that you can 
claim your balances the moment they are wanted. By pursuing such a system you will I hope soon be able to regain 
your ascendency over the State institutions without risk or 
inconvenience.
