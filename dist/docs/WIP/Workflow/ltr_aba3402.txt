MY DEAR LUCY, 
</p><p>
I promised to write to you from the Hague, but 
your uncle's unexpected arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> prevented 
me. Your uncle purchased an excellent travelling 
coach in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, and hired a post-chaise for our 
servants. In this manner we travelled from <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> 
to Dover, accommodated through England with the 
best of horses, postilions, and good carriages ; 
clean, neat apartments, genteel entertainment, and 
prompt attendance. But no sooner do you cross 
from Dover to Calais, than every thing is reversed, 
and yet the distance is very small between them. 
</p><p>
The cultivation is by no means equal to that of 
England ; the villages look poor and mean, the 
houses all thatched, and rarely a glass window in 
them ; their horses, instead of being handsomely 
harnessed, as those in England are, have the appearance of so many old cart-horses. Along you 
go, with seven horses tied up with ropes and chains, 
rattling like trucks ; two ragged postilions, mounted, with enormous jack-boots, add to the comic 
scene. And this is the style in which a duke or a 
count travels through this kingdom. You inquire of 
me how I like Paris. Why, they tell me I am no 
judge, for that I have not seen it yet. One thing, 
I know, and that is that I have smelt it. If I was 
agreeably disappointed in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>, I am as much 
disappointed in Paris. It is the very dirtiest place 
1 ever saw. There are some buildings and some 
squares, which are tolerable ; but in general the 
streets are narrow, the shops, the houses, inelegant 
and dirty, the streets full of lumber and stone, with 
which they build. <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> cannot boast so elegant 
public buildings ; but, in every other respect, it is as 
much superior in ray eyes to Paris, as <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a> is to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. To have had Paris tolerable to me, I should 
not have gone to <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. As to the people here, 
they are more given to hospitality than in England, 
it is said. I have been in company with but one 
French ladv since I arrived ; for strangers here 
make the first visit, and nobody will know you until 
you have waited upon them in form. 
</p><p>
This lady l I dined with at <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='met acquaintance'>Dr. Franklin</a>'s. She 
entered the room with a careless, jaunty air ; upon 
seeing ladies who were strangers to her, she bawled 
out, " Ah ! mon Dieu, where is Franklin ? Why 
did you not tell me there were ladies here ? " You 
must suppose her speaking all this in French. 
" How I look ! " said she, taking hold of a chemise 
made of tiffany, which she had on over a blue lutestring, and which looked as much upon the decay 
as her beauty, for she was once a handsome woman ; 
her hair was frizzled ; over it she had a small 
straw hat, with a dirty gauze half-handkerchief 
round it, and a bit of dirtier gauze, than ever my 
maids wore, was bowed on behind. She had a black 
gauze scarf thrown over her shoulders. She ran 
out of the room ; when she returned, the Doctor 
entered at one door, she at the other ; upon which 
she ran forward to him, caught him by the hand, 
" Helas ! Franklin ; " then gave him a double kiss, 
one upon each cheek, and another upon his forehead. When we went into the room to dine, she 
was placed between' the Doctor and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a>. 
She carried on the chief of the conversation at 
dinner, frequently locking her hand into the Doctor's, and sometimes spreading her arms upon the 
backs of both the gentlemen's chairs, then throwing 
her arm carelessly upon the Doctor's neck. 
</p><p>
I should have been greatly astonished at this 
conduct, if the good Doctor had not told me that in 
this lady I should see a genuine Frenchwoman, 
wholly free from affectation or stiffness of behaviour, 
and one of the best women in the world. For this 
I ' must take the Doctor's word ; but I should have 
set her down for a very bad one, although sixty 
years of age, and a widow. I own I was highly 
disgusted, and never wish for an acquaintance with 
any ladies of this cast. After dinner she threw 
herself upon a settee, where she showed more than 
her feet. She had a little lap-dog, who was, next 
to the Doctor, her favorite. This she kissed, and 
when he wet the floor she wiped it up with her 
chemise. This is one of the Doctor's most intimate 
friends, with whom he dines once every week, and 
she with him. She is rich, and is my near neighbour ; but I have not yet visited her. Thus you 
see, my dear, that manners differ exceedingly in 
different countries. I hope, however, to find amongst 
the French ladies manners more consistent with my 
ideas of decency, or I shall be a mere recluse. 
</p><p>
You must write to me, and let me know all about 
you ; marriages, births, and preferments ; every 
thing you can think of. Give my respects to the 
Germantown family. I shall begin to get letters 
for them by the next vessel. 
Good night. Believe me 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate aunt, 
</p><p>
A. A.
