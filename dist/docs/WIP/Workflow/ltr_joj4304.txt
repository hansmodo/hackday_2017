I congratulate you, my dear Sir, on the adoption of the Constitution by Virginia. That event has disappointed the expectation of opposition here, which 
nevertheless continues pertinacious. The unanimity 
of the southern district, and their apparent determination to continue under the wings of the Union, operate powerfully on the minds of the opposite party. 
The Constitution constantly gains advocates among the people, and its enemies in the Convention seem to be much embarrassed.

We have gone through the Constitution in a Committee of the Whole. We finished yesterday morning. 
The amendments proposed are numerous. How we are 
to consider them, is yet a question, which a day or 
two more must answer. A bill of rights has been 
offered, with a view, as they say, of having it incorporated in the rcdificaiion. The ground of rejection, 
therefore, seems to be entirely deserted. We understand that a Committee will this day be appointed to 
arrange the amendments. We learn from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> that 
an affray happened there, on the 4th instant, between the two parties, in which near thirty were wounded, 
some few very dangerously. From what I have just heard, the party begins to divide in their opinions. Some insist on pi'evious conditional amendments. A 
greater number will be satisfied with siihsecjucnt conditional amendments ; or, in other words, they are for 
ratifying the Constitution on condition that certain amendments take place within a given time. These 
circumstances afford room for hope. With the greatest respect and esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate and humble servant,

John Jay.
