MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
YOUR favor of the 28th ultimo arrived this morning. 
Before this time I hope you have received your furniture. 
</p><p>
We are still endeavoring to preserve peace ; but 
one moves a series of commercial regulations, an 
other, a sequestration of debts, a third,to prohibit 
all intercourse with Britain, a fourth, to issue letters 
of marque against Algerines, all tending to excite 
suspicions in Britain that we are hostile to her, and 
mean ultimately to join her enemies. One firebrand 
is scarcely quenched before another is thrown in ; 
and if the sound part of the community is not uncommonly active and attentive to support us, we shall be 
drawn off from our neutral ground and involved in 
incomprehensible evils. In danger of a war that will 
be unnecessary, if not unjust, that has no public object in view, that must be carried on with allies the 
most dangerous that ever existed, my situation is as 
disagreeable as any I ever knew. I should have no 
fear of an honest war, but a knavish one would fill 
me with disgust and abhorrence. 
</p><p>
At nine o clock at night I suppose your election is 
over, and another fortnight will enable us to guess 
whether an Adams or a Gushing is to be the great 
man. Although the old gentleman's conduct is not 
such as I can approve in many things of late years, 
yet I find it difficult to believe that the people of Massachusetts will forsake him in his last moments. 
Alas ! his grandeur must be of short duration, if it 
ever commences. I shall be happier at home, if 
Gushing succeeds ; and the State, I believe, will be 
more prudently conducted. 
</p><p>
The federalists have ventured on a dangerous manoeuvre. I am afraid the delicacy which has usually 
attended elections in New England will be injured if 
not destroyed by these elections of governors and 
senators, so as to be never regained even in the choice 
of representatives. But we must fulfil our destiny. 
I am afraid I shall not see you till election. I never 
longed more to be at home. 
</p><p>
Yours, most tenderly, 
</p><p>
