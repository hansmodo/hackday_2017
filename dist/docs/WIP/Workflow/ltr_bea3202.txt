<a rel="month origin" value="3">March</a> <a rel="day origin" value="20">20th</a>. Dear Sir, The foregoing is a copy 
of a letter I did myself the honor of writing your Excellency, which went by express the day it was 
wrote, from Colonel Mitchei's office. As a fortnight 
has elapsed, and I have not been favored with an 
answer, I conclude the letter has miscarried ; I there 
fore take the liberty of sending a copy. If the 
service will not admit of a draft of men from the 
army, the expedition must, of course, be declined, as there is not the least probability of manning the 
ships without; in which case, I must request of your Excellency a leave of absence for the ensuing sum 
mer, or until my wounds are so well as to admit 
my riding and walking with some degree of ease, 
and, of course, being able to take the command of a 
division in the army. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will believe I should not ask this 
indulgence, could I, with justice to myself or country, take a command in the condition I am at present. My surgeons flatter me that a voyage to sea, 
and bathing frequently in salt water, will be of great 
service in strengthening my leg, and relaxing the 
muscles, which are greatly contracted, and thereby 
rendering it more useful. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Arnold yesterday presented me with a son. 
She joins me in best respects to Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. I 
have the honor to be, very sincerely and affectionately, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,
