My dear Sir 
</p><p>
In our conversation yesterday, you expressed a wish to know the situation in which the Bank stands with regard to Mess rs . Gales &amp; Seaton of Washington. I will explain it to 
you with pleasure, as I presume the facts will remove an erroneous impression with respect to the Bank as well as those gentlemen themselves. 
</p><p>
They were formerly in succession, Directors of the Branch in Washington, their debt amounted at one time to about 
Sixty thousand dollars. In January <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a> being myself in 
Washington, I found it about Fifty thousand Dollars, which 
I thought much too high. I therefore resisted a recommendation to place one of them in the Board &amp; advised a reduction 
of the debt which has accordingly been done, so that I believe the whole responsibility of both parties does not now exceed 
between eleven &amp; twelve thousand dollars, there having been paid by a sale of their property since March last more than 
$30,000. Even of the present debt, about $<a href='/results.php?year=5000'>5000</a> was not a loan 
from the Branch but was transferred from the Bank of Columbia in the settlement of its affairs with the Branch so 
that of the sum actually lent, the amount now due is, as you perceive, very small. 
</p><p>
In Nov'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a>, they applied for a loan of $15,000 from the 
Parent Bank and their application was much recommended 
by their friends on the ground of the usefulness of their paper 
and the probability of its discontinuance if the loan were not 
made. But the Board refused to make the loan. They thought 
that the only true course of the Bank was to lend its money 
</p><p>
on business principles and with adequate security that no 
distinction could be made between its friends and its enemies 
and that to go out of its way to make a loan to the editors 
of a newspaper would be to depart from its system of total 
indifference and entire abstraction, with regard to politics. In 
the present case too, the Bank might place itself in the very 
unbecoming attitude of sustaining at the seat of Government 
a paper opposed to the existing administration. 
</p><p>
You will think well of our impartiality when I mention 
that in running my eye over the Washington Pay List, to 
see the liabilities of Mess" Gales &amp; Sea ton, I remarked that 
our friend the Editor 1 of the Telegraph has between $11 and 
$12,000 an amount about the same as the Editors of the 
Intelligencer. In truth, you know, my dear Sir, how constantly &amp; strenuously the Bank has resisted every thing like 
political influence believing as we all do that the moment the 
Institution is subjected to any party, whether in power or 
out of power, it becomes a curse to the country. 
</p><p>
I have spoken to you freely about the pecuniary affairs 
of these parties circumstances, which as a member of the 
Board I wish you to know &amp; I confide them entirely to your 
judgment and discretion.
