My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have just had the satisfaction of receiving your 
kind letter of the 13th . The relation of what has 
passed, since I last had the pleasure of writing, will not 
in general amuse you, but it is necessary that you sh'd 
know it, and I will be exceedingly brief. According 
to the first plan proposed by <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>, the 
American forces were to land on the east side of 
Rhode Island under cover of the fire of three frigates 
stationed in the eastern channel for that purpose. A 
signal was to be given immediately as our boats 
should begin to cross, and another when the descent 
should be effected. Upon the latter, the French 
troops were to disembark on the east side of the 
island, and a junction was to be formed as speedily as 
possible ; but the ambition of an individual and national pride discovered insuperable obstacles to this 
disposition. The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> aspired to the 
command of the French troops in conjunction with the flower of <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a>'s army. In a visit which he 
had paid to the fleet, he prevailed upon the Count D'Estaing to write upon this suhject. The count intimated in his letter a desire that some good American 
troops sh'd be annexed to the French, adding that if 
the command of them were given to M. de Lafayette 
it w'd be a means of facilitating the junction between 
the troops of the two nations, as he was acquainted 
with the service of both, and that in case any naval 
operations sh'd require his (the count s) return on board 
the squadron, the Marquis w'd naturally take the 
command in his absence which w'd prevent many 
difficulties that w'd arise on that account. The 
Marquis strenuously contended that a considerable 
detachment of select troops ought to be annexed to 
the French. The pride of his nation would never 
suffer the present disposition to take place, as by it 
the French batallions w'd land under cover of the 
American fire, and play a humiliating secondary part. 
</p><p>
The arguments against gratifying him in his request 
were these : <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>General Sullivan</a>'s army contained a 
very small proportion of regular troops ; it was necessary that a main body capable of resisting the enemy's 
force should exist, as a contrary conduct w'd expose 
either division to a total defeat or a vigorous attack 
from the enemy. The Marquis, however, seemed 
much dissatisfied, and his private views withdrew 
his attention wholly from the general interest. 
</p><p>
On the 8th <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> received a letter from the 
Admiral, in which he says that the disposition for 
disembarking is militarily impossible. That the Ame 
rican generals were now for the first time furnished 
with an opportunity of discovering the value which 
they set on the French alliance, by the number and 
composition of the troops which they w'd annex to the 
French. It was not for him to point out the number, 
but he w'd gladly have it in his power to give an 
account both to the Congress and his king of the 
American detachm* which should be sent to him. In 
consequence of this letter, it was determined that 
Jackson's regiment, and as many good militia as in 
the whole w'd amount to 1,000 men sh'd be sent under 
the command of the marquis. The tardiness of the 
militia and the impossibility of completing the trans 
port boats so soon as expected, and the slow arrival of 
the heavy cannon, had obliged <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> more 
than once to procrastinate the attack. He had fixed 
on the 9th , and for the reasons mentioned in my last, 
the Count was to force his passage with the squadron, 
on the 8th . 
</p><p>
The Gen'l found it impossible to keep his word, and 
wrote to appoint another day on which he declared 
he w'd make his descent at all events. 
</p><p>
The Count, however, had made his arrangements 
and entered the harbour on the 8th . A thundering 
cannonade was kept up between the batteries and 
ships as they passed. The injury to the latter is not 
worth notice. 
</p><p>
9th , <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Sullivan</a> received intelligence both from 
deserters and inhabitants, that the enemy had evacuated all their redoubts and batteries on the north part 
of the island. He took the hardy resolution of availing himself of this move and threw his whole army 
across. 1 This measure gave much umbrage to the 
French officers. They conceived their troops injured 
by our landing first, and talked like women disputing 
precedence in a country dance, instead of men en 
gaged in pursuing the common interest of two great 
nations. 
</p><p>
Admiral Howe's fleet appeared in the offing. 
</p><p>
10th . The French squadron passed the batteries of 
Newport (receiving their fire and returning broad 
sides), without receiving any damage by reason of the 
distance, and gave chase to the British fleet. On the 
11th such a storm of wind and rain arose as filled us 
with anxiety for the French squadron. The army 
suffered much during the bad weather for want of 
tents, and on account of the impossibility of crossing 
the ferry, which circumstance reduced our magazines 
to a low ebb. 
</p><p>
On the 15th , the army moved to a position for com 
mencing its operations against the enemy, and some 
works were thrown up the same night for its security. 
</p><p>
On the evening of the 16th , a battery of protection 
and its communication were begun. The next morn
</p><p>
An officer was sent immediately to give the Admiral notice of it.ing as soon as our unfinished work could be discovered, the enemy's batteries began to fire on it. Our 
works have been carrying on every night since ; and 
as long as day-light lasts there is generally a slow 
firing kept up on each side, without any effect worth 
mentioning. On account of the great distance, the 
method that has been hitherto pursued will prove very 
tedious if continued. 
</p><p>
20th . The French squadron appears and terminates 
much anxiety. The Admiral's ship and the Marseilles 
were dismasted in the storm. The former totally dismasted, without a rudder, was attacked by a British 
fifty gun ship, which she obliged to sheer off, by 
bringing her stern chasers to bear. Imagine the cruel 
situation of the Count to see his ship thus insulted, 
after having arrived in the midst of the English 
squadron and preparing for a combat in which victory 
was inevitably his; but a most dreadful storm of 
which he had no idea, dispersed every thing. 
</p><p>
I was going on, but was called away upon the most 
important business. 
</p><p>
The council of war on board the French vessels 
have determined that the squadron ought to go immediately to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to refit. I am going on board with 
a solemn protest against it. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
