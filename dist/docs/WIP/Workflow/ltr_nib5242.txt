My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . But seriously, I do not feel the least anxiety about this sortie of the President, who with, I am sure, the best 
intentions, has erred from want of information what I regret &amp; deeply regret, is the loss of individual property which 
it will occasion and the wound it will inflict on the credit of the country. When I look over the list of Stockholders &amp; see 
the number of females, of trust estates, &amp; societies charitable &amp; religious, it is melancholy to see their interest thus 
injured. This is particularly the case with South Carolina which owns, what two weeks ago was worth more than five 
millions of dollars. In regard to public credit, it is very fortunate that the Chief Magistrate of the Country should make 
an official declaration of its insolvency, should pronounce that what it pays to foreigners in dividends &amp; capital &amp; what 
it receives for revenue is an unsound paper. . . .

MEMORANDUM * 
</p><p>
Between Oct., <a href='/results.php?year=1829' rel="origin">1829</a> and Jan. <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr Biddle</a> 
</p><p>
(<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) I was very thankful to you for your 
plan of paying off the debt sent to Major Lewis. (N.B.) I 
thought it was my duty to submit it to you. (<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) 
I would have no difficulty in recommending it to Congress, 
but I think it right to be perfectly frank with you I do not 
think that the power of Congress extends to charter a Bank 
out of the ten mile square. I do not dislike your Bank any 
more than all banks. But ever since I read the history of the 
South Sea bubble I have been afraid of banks. I have read 
the opinion of John Marshall 2 who I believe was a great 
&amp; pure mind and could not agree with him though if 
he had said, that as it was necessary for the purpose of the 
national gov* there ought to be a national bank I should have 
been disposed to concur; but I do not think that Congress 
has a right to create a corporation out of the 10 mile square. 
I feel very sensibly the services rendered by the Bank at 
the last payment of the national debt &amp; shall take an opportunity of declarring it publicly in my message to Congress. 
</p><p>
That it is my own feeling to the Bank and Mr Ingham's also. He &amp; you got into a difficulty thro the foolishness 
if I may use the term of Mr. Hill (N.B. writes) observing he was a little embarrassed I said (")oh that has all 
passed now.(") He (Jackson) said with the Parent Board &amp; Myself he had every reason to be perfectly satisfied 
that he had heard complaints &amp; then mentioned a case 
at <a href='/results.php?city=louisville' rel='city'>Louisville</a> of which he promised to give me the particulars. 
</p><p>
(N.B.) I said (") well I am very much gratified at this frank 
explanation. We shall all be proud of any kind mention in the 
message for we should feel like soldiers after an action com 
mended by their General. (") (<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) Sir said he it 
would be only an act of justice to mention it.
