MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RETURNED last evening from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, where I went at the kind invitation of my uncle and aunt, to celebrate our annual festival. Dr. Cooper being dangerously sick, I went to hear Mr. Clark, who is settled with Dr. Chauncy. This gentleman gave us an animated, elegant, and sensible discourse, from 
Isaiah, 55th chapter, and 12th verse. " For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace ; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands."

Whilst he ascribed glory and praise unto the Most High, he considered the worthy, disinterested, and 
undaunted patriots as the instruments in the hand of Providence for accomplishing what was marvellous 
in our eyes. He recapitulated the dangers they had passed through, and the hazards they had run ; the firmness which had, in a particular manner, distinguished some characters, not only early to engage in so dangerous a contest, but, in spite of our gloomy 
prospects, to persevere even unto the end, until they had obtained a peace, safe and honorable, large 
as our desires, and much beyond our expectations. 
</p><p>
How did my heart dilate with pleasure, when, as each event was particularized, I could trace my 
friend as a principal in them ; could say it was he who was one of the first in joining the band of 
patriots, who formed our first national council ; it was he, who, though happy in his domestic attachments, left his wife, his children, then but infants, 
even surrounded with the horrors of war, terrified and distressed, the week before the memorable 19th 
of April, left them to the protection of that Providence which has never forsaken them, and joined 
himself undismayed to that respectable body, of which he was a member. Trace his conduct through 
every period, you will find him the same undaunted character, encountering the dangers of the ocean, 
risking captivity and a dungeon ; contending with wickedness in high places ; jeoparding his life, endangered by the intrigues, revenge, and malice of a potent, though defeated nation. These are not the mere eulogiums of conjugal affection, but certain 
facts and solid truths. My anxieties, my distresses, at every period, bear witness to them ; though now, by a series of prosperous events, the recollection is more sweet than painful.

Whilst I was in town, Mr. Dana arrived very unexpectedly ; for I had not received your letters by Mr. Thaxter. My uncle fortunately discovered him 
as he came up State Street, and instantly engaged him to dine with him, acquainting him that I was in 
town and at his house. The news soon reached my ears; "Mr. Dana arrived," "Mr. Dana arrived," 
from every person you saw ; but how was I affected? The tears involuntarily flowed from my eyes. 
Though God is my witness, I envied not the felicity of others, yet my heart swelled with grief; and 
the idea that I, I only, was left alone, recalled all the tender scenes of separation, and overcame all 
my fortitude. I retired, and reasoned myself into composure sufficient to see him without a childish emotion. 
</p><p>
But, O! my dearest friend, what shall I say to you in reply to your pressing invitation. I have 
already written to you in answer to your letters, which were dated September 10th, and reached me 
a month before those by Mr. Thaxter. I related to you all my fears respecting a winter's voyage. My 
friends are all against it, and Mr. Gerry, as you will see by the copy of his letter enclosed, has given his 
opinion upon well grounded reasons. If I should leave my affairs in the hands of my friends, there 
would be much to think of and much to do, to place them in that method and order I would wish to leave 
them in. Theory and practice are two very different things, and the object is magnified as I approach 
nearer to it. I think if you were abroad in a private character, and necessitated to continue there, I should 
not hesitate so much at coming to you ; but a mere American as I am, unacquainted with the etiquette 
of courts, taught to say the thing I mean, and to wear my heart in my countenance, I am sure I 
should make an awkward figure ; and then it would mortify my pride, if I should be thought to disgrace 
you. Yet, strip royalty of its pomp and power, and what are its votaries more than their fellow worms? 
</p><p>
I have so little of the ape about me, that I have refused every public invitation to figure in the gay 
world, and sequestered myself in this humble cottage, content with rural life and my domestic employment, in the midst of which I have sometimes smiled upon recollecting that I had the honor of being allied to an ambassador. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
