Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On Saturday last, in a Committee of the Whole 
House upon the State of the Commonwealth, to whom 
were referred sundry petitions, some praying for an 
emission of paper money, and others for making property, at an appraised value, a tender in discharge 
of debts, I moved and carried the resolutions of which 
I inclose a copy. During the discussion of the subject, after treating the petitions as founded upon 
fraud and knavery, I called upon any of the members of the House, who were advocates for such measures, if any such there were, to come boldly forward, 
and explain their real motives. But they declined 
entering into the debate, and the resolutions passed 
unanimously. I hope they have given this iniquitous 
measure a mortal stab, and that we shall not again 
be troubled with it. 
</p><p>
A resolution this day passed for an absolute prohibition of all imported spirits, with some others, in 
my opinion, almost equally impolitic, and calculated 
to subject the eastern part of the State to the arbitrary impositions of the western. The prohibition of 
the single article of rum, would cut off a net revenue of eleven thousand pounds per annum. When 
the bill is brought in, I think they will find such 
insuperable difficulties in the mode of carrying it 
into execution, as will oblige them to abandon the 
project. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of inclosing a copy of the resolutions upon the proposed Federal Government; by 
which it will appear that the Assembly have given 
time for full examination and discussion of the subject, and have avoided giving any opinion of their 
own upon the subject. 
</p><p>
I beg to be presented to your lady and family ; 
and am, with the greatest respect and regard, &c., 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. A plan is before the House for a three 
years' instalment of all debts. Though, in my opinion, very exceptionable, it is better than the plans of 
that kind heretofore proposed, and I believe will be 
adopted, in spite of every opposition that can be 
made to it. I shall, therefore, instead of pointing 
the little opposition I can make against the whole. 
endeavour to change the plan, hy making the consent of the creditor necessary, and the instalments 
voluntary, and, in such cases, giving the force of 
judgments to the instalment bonds.
