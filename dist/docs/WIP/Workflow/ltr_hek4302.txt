My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind favor of the 28th ultimo, which I received last evening, with its inclosures; 
and I sincerely hope I shall not be under the necessity of troubling you so much again. But, in the 
present instance, I am under the necessity of mentioning that Major Winthrop Sargent has repeatedly 
informed me, that a certificate from you would be one 
of the most desirable and acceptable things to him. 
I at length promised him that I would request it of 
you. He is really clever, and was an excellent artillery officer. 
</p><p>
I will endeavour to make an arrangement of the 
lime-stone, in the manner that shall be the least expensive ; but our spring is so backward, that we have 
but little prospect of getting the stone from the eastward before the month of June. It shall be forwarded by the earliest opportunity to your house, or 
<a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. The weather is now as severe as at any time during the winter, and the snow and ice are nearly three feet upon a level. 
</p><p>
I am highly delighted with the delicate gratitude 
of Virginia, and am at the same time charmed with 
your sentiments and reasoning upon it. I sincerely 
hope, circumstanced as you are, that you may find a 
mode of declining the intended appropriation, so as 
to enhance the respect and affection of your fellow citizens. My jealousy for your fame is so high that 
I should prefer seeing you, Cincinnatus-like, following 
your plough, rather than accept the least pecuniary 
reward whatever. Your services are of that nature as 
to demand the approbation and admiration of succeeding generations, but cannot be rewarded by money. 
Thank the Supreme God, you are happily placed above 
the necessity of receiving any assistance ! 
</p><p>
Perhaps, my dear Sir, you could intimate to the 
Legislature, in a manner which would be clear of 
every indelicate imputation, that, should they think 
proper to apply the produce of this fund to the 
maintenance of the widows, and the support and education of the children, of those men of their own line 
who sacrificed their lives in defence of their country, 
and of the maimed soldiers, that the measure would 
rear an eternal monument to the virtue of the Commonwealth of Virginia. An event of this kind, which, 
I am persuaded, has been among the number of expedients conceived by jou, would rank Virginia 
higher in the annals of America than any other 
State ; and the idea coming from you, would place 
your warm and disinterested attachment to suffering 
in a durable and glorious point of view. Let my affection plead my excuse for this freedom. 
</p><p>
The Mall, in this town, has been repaired, and the 
trees replaced. But I believe the gravel walk is only 
upon the common principle, without any cement 
whatever. I will, however, inquire, and if there should 
he any improvement, I will with pleasure communicate it.

You may probably have heard that Congress have 
been pleased to appoint me Secretary at War. I 
have accepted of the office, and expect to be in New 
York about the 15th of next month. From the habits imbibed during the war, and from the opinion 
of my friends that I should make but an indifferent 
trader, I thought, upon mature consideration, that it 
was well to accept it, although the salary (twenty-four hundred and fifty dollars) would be but a slender support. I have dependence upon an umvieldy 
estate belonging to Mrs. Knox's family, and upon the 
public certificates given for my services; but neither 
of these are productive, and require a course of years 
to make them so. In the mean time, my expenses 
are considerable, and require some funds for their 
supply. Congress have rendered the powers and duties of the office respectable, and the circumstances 
of my appointment were flattering, being without solicitation on my part, and nine States out of eleven 
voting for me. For this favorable opinion of Congress, I conceive myself indebted to your friendship. 
I do not intend to move my family to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
until next June. Mrs. Knox, who, with her little 
ones, are well, unites with me in presenting our affectionate respects to Mrs. Washington. I am, my dear 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your truly affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
