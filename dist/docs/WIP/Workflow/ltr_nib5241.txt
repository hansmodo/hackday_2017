My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 14th . You may readily imagine my surprize at 
seeing the remarks in the message after all I had mentioned to you in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. But it is better to try to repair it than to 
regret it and I am not sure whether it may not on the whole do good by satisfying the country of the usefulness of the 
institution &amp; spreading a very salutary dread of the monster whom it is proposed to substitute for it. The consolations on 
the present occasion are, that this is a measure emanating exclusively from the President in person, being the remains 
of old notions of constitutionality, 1 that it is not a Cabinet measure nor a party measure ; that the whole foundation of the 
reproach of the want of a sound currency is so notoriously the very reverse of the fact; and that it has produced in all quarters the most decided disapprobation. ....
