MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I WISH you a happy new year, and a repetition of 
happy new years as long as time shall endure ; not 
here below, because I shall want you in another 
country, better than this. 
What do you say ? Shall I keep a national thanks 
giving with you ? I hope, before that day, we shall 
have good news from all our family, though we can 
not be all together. 
</p><p>
Compliments of the season to L., and all my 
good friends. Don t forget my farm next time you 
write. I hope to find a letter at the Senate chamber. 
</p><p>
Adieu.
