MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
From the interest you take in every thing which concerns your friends, I hear you inquiring how I do, 
how I live, whom I see, where I visit, who visit me. 
I know not whether your curiosity extends so far as 
the color of the house, which is white stone, and to 
the furniture of the chamber where I sleep. If it 
does, you must apply to Betsey Cranch for information, whose fancy has employed itself so busily as to 
seek for intelligence even in the minutiae ; and, 
although they look trifling upon paper, yet, if our 
friends take an interest in them, that renders them 
important ; and I am the rather tempted to a compliance from the recollection, that, when I have received a sentimental letter from an absent friend, I 
have passed over the sentiment at the first reading, 
and hunted for that part, which more particularly related to themselves. 
</p><p>
This village, where we reside, is four miles from 
Paris, and is famous for nothing, that I know of, but 
the learned men who have inhabited it. Such were 
Boileau, Moliere, D'Aguesseau, and Helvetius. The 
first and last lived near this hotel, and Boileau's 
garden is preserved as a choice relic. As to my 
own health, it is much as usual. I suffer through 
want of exercise, and grow too fat. I cannot persuade myself to walk an hour in the day, in a long 
entry which we have, merely for exercise ; and as 
to the streets, they are continually a quagmire. No 
walking there without boots or wooden shoes, neither 
of which are my feet calculated for. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> 
makes it his constant practice to walk several miles 
every day, without which he would not be able to 
preserve his health, which at best is but infirm. He 
professes himself so much happier for having his 
family with him, that I feel amply gratified in 
having ventured across the ocean. He is determined, that nothing but the inevitable stroke of death 
shall in future separate him at least from one part 
of it ; so that I know not what climates I may yet 
have to visit, more, I fear, than will be agreeable to either of us. 
</p><p>
If you want to know the manners and customs of 
this country, I answer you, that pleasure is the business of life, more especially upon a Sunday. We 
have no days with us or rather with you, by which 
I can give you any idea of them, except Commencements and Elections. We have a pretty wood 
within a few rods of this house, which is called the 
Bois de Boulogne. This is cut into many regular 
walks, and during the summer months, upon Sundays, it looked like <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> Commons 
upon the public days I have mentioned. Paris is a 
horrid dirty city, and I know not whether the inhabitants could exist, if they did not come out one 
day in the week to breathe a fresh air. I have sat 
at my window of a Sunday, and seen whole cartloads of them at a time. I speak literally ; for those, 
who neither own a coach nor are able to hire one, 
procure a cart, which in this country is always 
drawn by horses. Sometimes they have a piece of 
canvass over it. There are benches placed in them, 
and in this vehicle you will see as many well-dressed 
women and children as can possibly pile in, led out 
by a man, or driven. Just at the entrance of the 
wood they descend. The day is spent in music, 
dancing, and every kind of play. It is a very rare 
thing to see a man with a hat anywhere but under 
his arm, or a woman with a bonnet upon her head. 
This would brush off the powder, and spoil the elegant toupet. They have a fashion of wearing a 
hood or veil either of gauze or silk. If you send 
for a tailor in this country, your servant will very 
soon introduce to you a gentleman full dressed in 
black, with his head as white as a snow-bank, and 
which a hat never rumpled. If you send to a mantuamaker, she will visit you in the same style, with her 
silk gown and petticoat, her head in ample order, 
though, perhaps, she lives up five pair of stairs, and 
eats nothing but bread and water, as two thirds of 
these people do. We have a servant in our family, 
who dresses more than his young master, and would 
not be guilty of tending table unfrizzed, upon any 
consideration. He dresses the hair of his young 
master, but has his own dressed by a hair-dresser. 
By the way, I was guilty of a sad mistake in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. I desired the servant to procure me a barber. 
The fellow stared, and was loth to ask for what purpose I wanted him. At last he said, " You mean a 
hair-dresser, Madam, I believe ? " " Ay," says I, 
" I want my hair dressed." " Why, barbers, Madam, 
in this country, do nothing but shave." 
</p><p>
When I first came to this country, I was loth to 
submit to such an unnecessary number of domestics, 
as it appeared to me, but I soon found that they 
would not let me do without them ; because, every 
one having a fixed and settled department, they 
would not lift a pin out of it, although two thirds of 
the time they had no employment. We are however thankful that we are able to make eight do for 
us, though we meet with some difficulties for want of 
a ninth. Do not suppose from this, that we live 
remarkably nice. I never put up in America with 
what I do here. I often think of Swift's High 
Dutch bride, who had so much nastiness, and so 
much pride. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
A. A.
