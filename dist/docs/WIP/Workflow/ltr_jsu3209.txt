DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Perhaps there was never more justice in any ad 
vice than that given by the philosopher to his prince, 
namely, "Always beware of the man that flatters you, 
and appears to coincide with your sentiments on all occasions." 
</p><p>
I am confident that I have never appeared to your Excellency in this character; nay, I have studied to 
avoid even the appearance of being a flatterer. I 
knew, at the same time, that your Excellency, as 
well as all others in high office, had those animals 
constantly courting your favors ; and, I confess that 
I have sometimes felt an uneasiness, lest my neglect 
of expressing those sentiments of esteem and affection which I really felt should be construed into a 
want of cordial esteem for that Commander, to whom 
America stands so much indebted. Conscious, how 
ever, of my own sincerity, I contented myself with 
yielding a cheerful obedience to all orders your Excellency was pleased to honor me with; not doubting 
that some future period might discover in whose 
bosom the most lively sentiments of friendship and esteem were lodged. But, as my present state of 
health almost forbids me to hope for the honor of 
serving again under your command, your Excellency 
will excuse me in declaring that I have ever felt 
those exalted sentiments of esteem and affection for 
you, that even your sincerest friend can boast. My 
public and constant declaration has been, and I now 
repeat, that, in my opinion, you are the saviour of 
this country ; and that to your fortitude, bravery, and 
steady perseverance, do we owe the independence and 
freedom we enjoy. 
</p><p>
This I say, to remove any doubts that may have 
arisen respecting my friendship and affection ; and I 
should now have avoided it, did not my own feelings 
too strongly indicate that I can never have the plea 
sure of again serving under your Excellency's command. 
</p><p>
You will please to pardon this long and (I dare-say) to you tedious introduction to something more 
interesting. Permit me, then, to inform your Excellency, that the faction raised against you in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, 
into which General Conway was Unfortunately and 
imprudently drawn, is not yet destroyed. The members are waiting to collect strength, and seize some 
favorable moment to appear in force. I speak not 
from conjecture, but from certain knowledge. Their 
plan is to take every method of proving the danger 
arising from a Commander who enjoys the full and 
unlimited confidence of his army, and alarm the people with the prospect of imaginary evils; nay, they 
will endeavour to convert your virtues into arrows, 
with which they will seek to torment you. 
</p><p>
This plan was adopted the last winter ; and, if you 
will take the trouble of reading Mr. Tudor's oration, 
delivered at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in March last, you will find every line calculated to answer this purpose. The words 
are Tudor's, but the thoughts are borrowed. I heard 
them thrown out long before they were by him laid 
before the public. 
</p><p>
Here I cannot help digressing to congratulate your Excellency on your compelling them to attack your virtue, and not putting it in their power to point out a single vice. 
</p><p>
The next step is to persuade Congress that the 
military power of America should be placed in three or four different hands; each having a separate quarter of the Continent assigned him ; each commander 
to answer to Congress only for his conduct. This, 
they say, will prevent an aspiring commander from 
enslaving his country, and put it in the power of 
Congress, with the assistance of the other commanders, to punish the attempt. This is a refinement in 
politics, and an improvement on public virtue, which 
Greece or Rome could never boast. 
</p><p>
The present time is unfavorable to their design. 
They well know, that the voice of citizens and soldiers would be almost unanimously against them. 
But they wait a more favorable opportunity, which 
they will certainly improve. I am well convinced 
that they cannot succeed; yet I thought it my duty, 
in the moment of my departure, to give your Excellency this notice, that you may not only be on your guard, but avoid intrusting those in matters where 
your interest and honor are nearly concerned. appearances may deceive even an angel. Could you 
have believed, four years since, that those adulators, 
those persons so tenderly and so friendly used, as 
were Gates, Mifflin, Reed, and Tudor, would become 
your secret and bitter, though unprovoked enemies? 
If we view them now, we cannot help lamenting the 
want of sincerity in mankind. I persuade myself 
that your Excellency's steady and prudent conduct 
will baffle every attempt, and I feel happy in having 
discharged my duty to the best of commanders ; and 
only beg leave to assure your Excellency, that, in 
whatever station fortune may place me in future, no 
man will be more ready to bestow the rewards due 
to your Excellency's disinterested zeal, bravery, fortitude, and perseverance, than, dear General, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and devoted servant,
