Dear General, 
</p><p>
After a variety of marches and countermarches, 
frequently offering battle to Lord Cornwallis upon 
military terms, the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> received intelligence on the 5tli that the enemy had marched 
from <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a> for Jamestown, and were preparing 
to throw their baggage and troops over that river. 
This induced the General to make a forward move 
to this place with the Continental troops, including 
Major Macpherson's little legion, together with a few 
volunteer dragoons under Colonel Mercer and Captain 
Hill, the vicinity of which to the enemy was such as 
to put it into his powder to strike them, should the 
passage of the James be their object. 
</p><p>
On the morning of the 6th several corroborating 
advices arrived, removing every doubt upon that head, 
with the addition that nothing but a forced march, 
with the lightest and most advanced part of the troops, 
could arrive in time to affect their rear. This induced 
the Marquis to order the advanced guard, Major Macpherson's, Colonel Mercer's, and Captain Hill's corps, 
one hundred and fifty riflemen, with Colonel Stewart's 
detachment of Pennsylvanians, amounting in the whole 
to about five hundred men, artillery and dragoons included, to make a forward move under my conduct, 
and endeavour to come up with the enemy. 
</p><p>
Upon our arrival at the Green Spring Farm, a variety of contradictory intelligence rendered it prudent 
to reconnoitre them with a military eye. Their vast 
superiority in horse also made it expedient to advance the whole of our little corps to drive in their 
guards, and keep their horse in check. About this 
period the Marquis arrived in person, and adopted 
the manoeuvre, which being effected, it was soon discovered that a very considerable part of their army 
yet remained on this side of the river, which induced 
the General to send for the remainder of the Continentals, distant about six miles. At two o'clock, P. M., 
a large smoke was raised by the enemy, probably as 
a signal to their parties to return to camp, and for 
all such as had crossed the river to repass it. 
</p><p>
At three o'clock the riflemen, supported by a few 
regulars, began and kept up a galling fire upon the 
enemy, which continued until five in the evening, 
when the British began to move forward in five 
columns. The Marquis, anxious to view them near, 
had proceeded rather far upon their left. It was 
therefore thought proper to order Major Galvan, at 
the head of the advanced guard, to meet and attack 
their front ; who, after a spirited though unequal contest, retired upon our left. A detachment of the 
light infantry, under Major Willis, having that moment arrived, also commenced a severe fire upon the 
enemy's left, but were obliged to fall back; which 
the enemy taking advantage of, began to turn our 
flanks, a manoeuvre by which, had they persevered, 
they must inevitably have penetrated between this 
corps and the other part of the army. But being 
joined at this crisis by Lieutenant-Colonel Harmer 
and Major Edwards, with two detachments from the 
second and third battalions of Pennsylvanians, under 
Colonel Hampton, it was determined, among a choice 
of difficulties, to advance and charge them. This was 
done with such vivacity as to produce the desired 
effect; that is, checking them in their advance, and 
diverting; them from their first manoeuvre. 
</p><p>
But, being enveloped by numbers, many brave and 
worthy officers and soldiers killed or wounded, we 
found it expedient to fall back half a mile to Green 
Spring Farm. Two of our field-pieces, which were 
necessarily introduced to keep up the idea of our 
being in force, were served with equal spirit and 
effect, until disabled by having Captain Crosby, with 
many matrosses, dangerously wounded, and all the 
horses killed. They at last fell into their hands. 
The wagons and ammunition were carried off safe. 
The enemy, sore from the contest, and finding us 
supported at that place by the remainder of the 
light infantry, were content with barely keeping the 
field, although opposed but by a handful of men 
compared with their numbers ; and who, from the 
nature of the ground, were obliged to act in a detached manner, except that part of the Pennsylvania 
line which had time to arrive, and then not more 
than five hundred men, with a few dragoons under 
Major Macpherson. 
</p><p>
From the mutual emulation in the officers and men 
of each corps, I am confident that, had the army 
been in force, victory would have inclined to our 
arms. However, every circumstance considered, our 
small reconnoitring party of horse and foot, who had 
the hardiness to engage Lord Cornwallis at the head 
of his whole army, with the advantage of so numerous a cavalry, on their own ground, and in their 
own camp, is more to be envied than pitied ; as it 
not only disconcerted the British General, and effectually amused him from his premeditated manoeuvre, 
but precipitated his retreat to James Island the same 
night, to avoid a general action in the morning, which 
the pointed attack he experienced in the evening 
might be the sanguinary prelude to. 
</p><p>
Our Field-Officers were generally dismounted by having their horses either killed or wounded under them. Colonel Cheeves, and other young Virginian 
gentlemen of his corps, were not more fortunate. I will not condole with the Marquis for the loss of two of his, as he was frequently requested to keep 
at a greater distance. His native bravery rendered him deaf to the admonition. I cannot attempt to discriminate between any corps of officers or men so 
equally deserving; but beg leave to observe, that if they possess a fault, it is an excess of bravery, a crime the least to be reprehended in a soldier. 
</p><p>
As the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> will furnish your Excellency with a general return of the killed and wounded, I shall only mention that the enemy, from 
every account and circumstance, have sustained a loss of near three hundred men in killed and wounded, among whom are many officers. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=atw" rel="me">Anthony Wayne</a>.

P. S. Colonel Stewart requests his best compliments to your Excellency. His small detachment suffered most, from their local situation.
