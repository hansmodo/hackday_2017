SIR, 
</p><p>
The above is a Copy of my last. A few Days after my 
leaving your Petition with Lord Dartmouth, his Lordship 
sent for me to discourse with me upon it. After a long 
Audience, he was pleased to say, that, notwithstanding all I 
had said or that could be said, in Support and Justification of 
the Petition, he was sure the presenting it at this time could 
not possibly produce any good: That the King would be 
exceedingly offended, but what Steps his Majesty would take 
upon it was uncertain ; perhaps he would require the Opinion 
of the Judges or Government Lawyers, which would surely 
be against us; perhaps he might lay it before Parliam', 
and so the Censure of both Houses would be drawn down 
upon us. The most favourable thing to be expected was 
a severe Reprimand to the Assembly by Order of his Majesty the natural Consequence of which must be more Discontent and Uneasiness in the Province. That possessed as he 
was with great Good will for New England, he was extreamly 
unwilling, that one of the first Acts of his Administration, 
with regard to the Massachusetts, should be of so unpleasant 
a Nature. That Minds had been heated and irritated on both 
Sides the Water, but he hoped those Heats were now cooling, 
and he was averse to the Addition of fresh Fuel. That as 
I had delivered the Petition to him officially, he must present 
it, if I insisted upon it; but he wished I would first consult 
my Constituents, who might possibly on Reconsideration think 
fit to order its being deferred. 
</p><p>
I answered, that the great Majority with which the Petition 
and the Resolves on which it was founded were carried thro' 
the House, made it scarce expectable, that their Order would 
be countermanded; that the slighting, evading, or refusing 
to receive Petitions from the Colonies, on some late Occasions by the Parliament, had occasioned a total loss of the 
Respect for and Confidence in that Body, formerly subsisting so strongly in America, and brought on a Questioning 
of their Authority: That his Lordship might observe Petitions came no more from thence to Parliament, but to the King only: That the King appeared now to be the only 
Connection between the two Countries; and that as a continued Union was essentially necessary to the Wellbeing of the 
Whole Empire, I should be sorry to see that Link weakened, 
as the other had been : That I thought it a dangerous Thing 
for any Governm' to refuse receiving Petitions, and thereby 
prevent the Subjects from giving vent to their Griefs. 
</p><p>
His L p interrupted me by replying, that he did not refuse 
to deliver the Petition ; that it should never justly be said of 
him, that he interrupted the Complaints of his Majesty's 
Subjects; and that he must and would present it, as he had 
said before, whenever I should absolutely require it; but 
from Motives of pure Good Will to the Province, he wish'd 
me not to insist on it, till I should receive fresh orders. 
</p><p>
Finally, considering that since the Petition was ordered, 
there had been a Change in the American Administration, 
that the present minister was our Friend in the Repeal of the 
Stamp Act, and seems still to have good Dispositions towards 
us; that you had mentioned to me the Probability, that the 
House would have remonstrated on all their other Grievances, 
had not their Time been taken up with the difficult Business 
of a general Valuation ; and since the Complaint of this Petition was likely alone to give Offence, it might perhaps be 
judg'd adviseable to give the Substance of all our Complaints 
at once, rather than in Parts and after a Reprimand received ; 
I say upon the whole I thought it best not to disoblige him in 
the Beginning of his Administration, by refusing him what 
he seem'd so desirous of, a Delay at least in presenting the 
Petition, till farther Directions should be received from my 
Constituents. If after Deliberation they should send me 
fresh Orders, I shall immediately obey them, and the Application to the Crown itself may possibly derive greater Weight 
from the Reconsideration given it, while the Temper of the 
House may be thought somewhat calmed by the Removal 
of a Minister, who had rendred himself so obnoxious to them. 
Accordingly, I consented to the Delay desired, wherein I 
hope my Conduct will not be disapproved. 
</p><p>
With the greatest Esteem and Respect, I have the Honour 
to be, Sir, your and the Committee's most obedient and most 
humble Serv, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
