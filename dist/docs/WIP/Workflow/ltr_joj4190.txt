Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 4th inst. I received by the mail from New-York 
your interesting letter of the 17th ult. I have read the 
pamphlets communicated to me by Mr. Grant, and derived 
from them the only knowledge I have of the transactions 
noticed in them. It would not be easy to introduce into 
my mind doubts of your rectitude. My opinion of it has 
undergone no alterations. You are drawing consolation 
from a source which always affords it. 
</p><p>
As to the work you mention, I am glad you have undertaken it, because it is desirable, and because I expect it will 
be well performed. It would give me pleasure to afford 
the aids you request, but the state of my health admits of 
very little exertion of mind or body. I can neither read 
nor write much at a time, without bringing on a feverish 
weariness. 
</p><p>
My public life did not commence so early as you supposed. In <a href='/results.php?year=1766'>1766</a>, 1 was a clerk in a lawyer's office, and on 
leaving it was occupied in professional affairs until the year 
<a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a>, when I was sent to the first Congress. In <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, I 
was also in Congress ; in <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, the Convention of this State 
detained me with them. In <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a> I was again sent to Congress, and remained there until September, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>, when I 
was sent to Europe. In <a href='/results.php?year=1784'>1784</a> I returned home. 
</p><p>
From this statement, you will perceive that my knowledge of the important events which occurred before the 
year <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> cannot be particular. 
</p><p>
The difficulty of collecting materials, and of ascertaining 
their real value, will increase with time. There are very 
few of the well-informed official men of those days now 
alive, and the few who remain will in a few years more be 
gone. To you I need not remark that many things have 
been written and said which are not correct. The collection of materials (if nothing to perfect it be left undone), 
will cost much time, trouble and expense. Some information may be acquired by letters, but much more and much 
better may be obtained by personal inspections, applications, 
and interviews. 
</p><p>
Valuable materials exist in the office of the secretary of 
state, in the public and private journals of Congress, and 
among the papers of the several States, &c. 
</p><p>
You know my sentiments respecting history, â€” festina lente. No good history has been, nor can be produced in haste. 
</p><p>
I regret the impediments which deprived me of the pleasure of the visit you intended. I hope some favourable opportunity of making it will yet occur, and that Mrs. Morse 
may come with you. We will then converse on these 
topics, and I will readily communicate to you such materials among those I possess, as you may deem interesting. 
</p><p>
Be so obliging as to assure Mr. and Mrs. Evarts of my 
best wishes for the health and prosperity of themselves and 
their family. I am glad thqj| little boy is doing well. May 
he long continue to do so in every respect. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Yours, very sincerely, 
</p><p>
