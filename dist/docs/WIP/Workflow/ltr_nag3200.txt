SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has made me very unhappy. I 
can submit very patiently to deserved censure ; but 
it wounds my feelings exceedingly to meet with a 
rebuke for doing what I conceived to be a proper 
part of my duty, and in the order of things. 
</p><p>
When I left your Excellency at Haverstraw, you 
desired me to go forward and reconnoitre the country, and fix upon some proper position to draw the 
troops together at, I was a stranger to all this part 
of the country, and could form no judgment of a 
proper place, until I had thoroughly examined the 
ground. 
</p><p>
Croton River was the only place I could find 
suitable to the purpose, all circumstances being 
taken into consideration. I wrote your Excellency 
what I had done, and where I was, that if you had 
any thing in charge I might receive your orders. I 
wrote you the reasons for my not waiting upon you 
in person were, I had many letters to answer, and 
many matters to regulate in my department, which 
prevented me from returning. Besides which, it 
was almost half a day's ride, the weather exceeding 
hot, and myself not a little fatigued. And here I 
must observe, that neither my constitution nor 
strength is equal to constant exercise. 
</p><p>
As I was a stranger to all the lower country, I 
thought it absolutely necessary for me to come for 
ward. A thorough knowledge of the country is not 
easily obtained ; such a one, at least, as is necessary 
to fix upon the most eligible position for forming a 
camp. The security of the army, the ease and convenience of the troops, as well as to perform the du 
ties of my office with a degree of reputation, all 
conspired to make me wish to fix upon the properest 
ground for the purpose. This it was impossible for 
me to do, unless I came on before the troops. And 
I must confess I saw no objection, as your Excellency had wrote me nothing to the contrary, and 
what I wrote naturally led to such a measure. 
</p><p>
I expected you on every hour, and was impatient 
to get forward that I might be able to give some 
account of the country when you came up. Before 
I left Crompond, I desired Mr. Pettit to wait upon 
you at your arrival, and take your orders, and if there was any thing special to forward it by ex 
press. 
</p><p>
If I had neglected my duty in pursuit of pleasure, 
or if I had been wanting in respect to your Excellency, I would have put my hand upon my mouth, 
and been silent upon the occasion ; but, as I am not 
conscious of being chargeable with either the one or 
the other, I cannot help thinking I have been treated 
with a degree of severity that I am in no respect 
deserving. And I would just observe here, that it is 
impossible for me to do my duty if I am always at 
head-quarters. I have ever given my attendance there as much as possible, both from a sense of duty 
and from inclination ; but constant attendance is out 
of my power, unless I neglect all other matters ; the 
propriety of which, and the consequences that will 
follow, I submit to your Excellency's consideration. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency well knows how I came into this 
department. It was by your special request, and you 
must be sensible there is no other man upon earth 
would have brought me into the business but you. 
The distress the department was in, the disgrace that 
must accompany your operations without a change, 
and the difficulty of engaging a person capable of 
conducting the business, together with the hopes of 
meeting your approbation, and having your full aid 
and assistance, reconciled me to the undertaking. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, when your Excellency takes a, view 
of the state things were in when I first engaged, 
and consider the short time we had to make the 
preparations for the opening campaign, and reflect 
with what ease and facility you began your march 
from <a href='/results.php?city=valley forge' rel='city'>Valley Forge</a>, and continued it all through the 
country r notwithstanding we went great part of the 
way entirely out of the line of preparations, you 
will do me the justice to say I have not been negli 
gent or inattentive to my duty. 
</p><p>
I have, in every respect, since I had my appointment, strove to accommodate the business of the department to the plan of jour Excellency's operations. 
And I can say, with great truth, that ever since I 
had the honor to serve under you, I have been more 
attentive to the public interest, and more engaged in 
the support of your Excellency's character, than ever 
I was to my own ease, interest, or reputation. 
</p><p>
I have never solicited you for a furlough to go 
home to indulge in pleasure, or to improve my interest, which, by the by, I have neglected, going on 
four years. I have never confined myself to my 
particular line of duty only. Neither have I ever 
spared myself, either by night or day, where it has 
been necessary to promote the public service under 
your direction. I have never been troublesome to 
your Excellency, to publish any thing to my advantage, although I think myself as justly entitled as 
some others, who have been much more fortunate, 
particularly in the action of the Brandywine. 
</p><p>
I have never suffered my pleasures to interfere 
with my duty ; and 1 am persuaded I have given 
too many unequivocal proofs of my attachment to 
your person and interest, to leave a doubt upon your mind to the contrary. I have always given you my 
opinion with great candor, and executed your orders 
with equal fidelity. I do not mean to arrogate to 
myself more merit than I deserve, or wish to exculpate myself from being chargeable with error, and in 
some instances negligence. However, I can speak, 
with a becoming pride, that I have always endeavoured to deserve the public esteem, and your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
As I came into the Quarter-master's department 
with reluctance, so I shall leave it with pleasure. 
Your influence brought me in, and the want of your approbation will induce me to go out. 
I am very sensible of many deficiens, but this 
is not so justly chargeable to my intentions, as to 
the difficult circumstances attending the business. It 
is almost impossible to get good men for the con 
ducting all parts of so complex a business. It may,therefore, naturally be expected that many things 
will wear an unfavorable complexion ; but, let who 
will undertake the business, they will find it very 
difficult, not to say impossible, to regulate it in such a manner as not to leave a door open for censure, 
and furnish a handle for reproach. I am, with all 
due respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant,
