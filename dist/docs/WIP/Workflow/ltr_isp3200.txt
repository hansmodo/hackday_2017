DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 8th, and imagine before this you have 
received mine of the same date, containing the disagreeable intelligence of the loss of Fort Montgomery, 
after a most spirited defence, and of our evacuating 
<a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> in consequence thereof. I congratulate you 
on the bravery of your troops in attacking and put 
ting to flight the British army, and regret the unfavorable circumstance that prevented its terminating 
in a complete victory. 
</p><p>
Last Monday, General Parsons, with about two 
thousand troops, marched down and took possession 
of <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> and the passes in the Highlands. He 
has taken a number of cattle, horses, and sheep, that 
were collected by the enemy. The enemy have burnt 
the buildings and barracks at the Village, and several 
dwelling-houses at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. They have demolished 
Forts Montgomery and Constitution, and are repairing Fort Clinton. Yesterday, about forty sail passed 
up the river, crowded with troops, and are now at 
anchor above <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, the wind not favoring. 
We were on our march after them, when I met the 
agreeable intelligence of the surrender of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> and his army, as prisoners of war, a copy 
of which is inclosed ; and thereupon I do most sincerely congratulate your Excellency. 
</p><p>
I have halted my troops, and am now considering 
what ought to be my next movement, I have sent 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> for his opinion on the subject, 
and ordered General Parsons to spare no pains to 
find the situation and strength of the garrison at 
King's Bridge, in order to direct my future operations most advantageously. I have about six thousand troops, who are chiefly militia. I understand 
that General Campbell was killed at Fort Montgomery and several field-officers, and others of inferior rank. 
</p><p>
The enemy's loss, by the last accounts I have been 
able to get, is very considerable ; not less than a 
thousand. The two Continental frigates, and the row galley which lay above Fort Montgomery, were burnt, 
to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, 
for which I am very sorry, as one, I believe, might 
have been saved. 
</p><p>
I have the unhappiness to inform you, that Mrs. 
Putnam, after a long and tedious illness, departed 
this life last Tuesday night. With the highest esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
