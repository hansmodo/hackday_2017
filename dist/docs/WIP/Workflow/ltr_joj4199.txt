I thank you, my good friend, for the kind letter (without 
date) which my son lately delivered to me, and for the 
pamphlets which were enclosed with it. 
</p><p>
The observations of your friend (inserted in your letter) 
are well written. I am pleased with the writer. He reasons with ability, and abstains from declamation. The 
lawfulness of the invasion and conquest of Canaan, being 
made by express Divine command, is indubitable. It does 
not decide the question, whether any wars, unless so commanded, are permitted by the moral law, and consequently 
by the gospel. Such wars occurred both before and after 
the time of Moses, and are recorded in Scripture without 
reproof. It does not appear that the war of Abraham 
against the kings was made by Divine command, nor that 
Jacob was commanded to take " out of the hand of the 
Amorite, with His sword and his how," the portion which 
he gave to Josepii ; nor does it appear that the war of 
David against Ilanun, and divers other wars, were so 
commanded. 
</p><p>
That the theocracy admitted of no other wars by the 
Israelites hut such as were expressly commanded by the 
Almighty, is not clear to me. Had Solomon heen of that 
opinion, I think he could not with propriety have taught 
that "by counsel thou shalt make war ; and in a multitude 
of counsellors there is safety. Every purpose is established 
by counsel; and with good advice make war." 
</p><p>
This, and other topics with which it is connected, open a 
wide field for investigation; but as the state of my health 
does not permit me to be more particular, I will only add, 
that when the arguments in favour of just and necessary 
war shall be shown to be fallacious, I shall not only think, 
but also act accordinglv. 
</p><p>
The extract from William Penn forms a useful tract ; 
and among other reasons, because it declares that '-'the 
Scriptures were given forth by holy men of God in divers 
ages, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit." I observe 
that this great truth is also inculcated by the trustees of the 
African Free School in their address. 
</p><p>
I did hope to have found in your letter some tidings respecting your brother. When you write to him, assure 
him of my esteem and regard ; and he pleased to accept 
the like assurance from 
</p><p>
Your friend,
