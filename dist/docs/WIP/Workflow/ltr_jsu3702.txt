Dear General, 
</p><p>
You will, I doubt not, forgive m} neglect in not 
writing you, when I assure you that I have had 
nothing to communicate which could give you pleasure, or avoid giving you pain ; and, that I was unwilling to add to the pressure which your mind has 
been so long accustomed to. To enumerate the evils 
which have flowed from party spirit, from inattention. 
and from other sources, would fill a volume in folio. 
We are now struggling to extricate ourselves from 
those difficulties into which our folly or our prejudices have thrown us. Perhaps we may succeed. 
Some advances have been made toward a reformation ; many more will shortly be attempted. 
</p><p>
The army is arranged, I hope, agreeably to your 
Excellency's wish. The officers have half-pay for 
life ; the States are called upon for men and specific 
supplies ; loans are demanded ; the several departments are arranging ; the expensive Naval and other 
Boards will be demolished, economy introduced, and, 
I trust, specie will relieve paper bills from the task 
of deceiving mankind, and yield to every man his 
just demand. Party spirit, though not annihilated, is 
compelled to hide its head ; and jealousy of the army, 
which has long obstructed salutary measures, dare not 
appear in public. I know it is late for a reformation to commence, but I hope not too late. I lament 
exceedingly the distresses of our army, and will 
cheerfully contribute every thing in my power to relieve them, or so lighten that burden which I know 
your Excellency must feel, provided I could have the 
honor of a line from you, pointing out the evils, and 
the mode you would have adopted for redress. 
</p><p>
I feel, very sensibly for the Southern States, and 
fear either a conquest by force, or a defection, which 
will bring about a base submission. We are informed 
that Clinton is about to embark, with great part of 
his army, for Virginia. Should this event take place, 
I fear the loss of the four Southern States will be 
the consequence. 
</p><p>
To prevent this, I beg leave to submit to your 
Excellency's consideration, whether it would not be 
prudent to order the French fleet to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, where 
they may lie in safety, and call the French army to 
head-quarters. Will not this cause Sir Henry to 
tremble for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and diminish the force, if not 
totally prevent, the blow meditated against the Southern States ? These are only hints, which arise from 
my zeal to save the Southern States, and which, 
however unmilitary and injudicious they may appear, 
I flatter myself your Excellency will readily pardon. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
