MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Doctor may have the steers if he wishes to have them. 
</p><p>
The people of the United States are about to be 
stirred up in every quarter of the union. The House 
of Representatives are determined to go all lengths. 
The merchants of this city have had the most numerous meeting that has been known for a long time, 
and unanimously voted to petition, that the faith, the 
honor, and the interest of the nation may be preserved. They have appointed committees to correspond 
with the merchants in all the seaports. I expect that 
the citizens will also be called together in the state 
house yard and it is said that the gentlemen will turn 
out, but the event will be doubtful. The state parties 
will all be agitated, and party spirit will be carried 
to the highest pitch. It must be a national determination, and if the nation solemnly determines upon 
war and confusion, they ought not to charge it to the 
government. These critical situations are familiar 
to me, and I always feel calmest in the midst of them. 
A few outlandish men in the House have taken the 
lead, and Madison, Giles and Baldwin are humble fol 
lowers. If the voice of the nation should be finally 
and decidedly in favor of the treaty, there will be a 
mortified party, so bitter, rancorous and desperate, 
fomented by foreign influence, in opposition, that the 
government will be very much embarrassed, and the 
public service very uncomfortable.

When I take a walk out of town and see the young 
clover beautifully starting, I long to see my own. 
Pray how fares it ? 
</p><p>
I have always thought it injudicious to make any 
attempt against the governor, knowing as I do, the 
habitual attachment to him, as well as the difficulty 
of uniting people in another. The countenance he 
gives to a very profligate party, is very pernicious to 
the public, but he is stimulated to it in part by the 
opposition to him, and he would not do less out of 
office. The constitution of our government is calculated to create, excite and support perpetual parties 
in the States, mixing and crossing alternately with 
parties in the federal government. It will be a perpetual confusion of parties. I fear we do not deserve 
all the blessings we have within our reach, and that 
our country must be deformed with divisions, contests, 
dissensions and civil wars as well as others. 
</p><p>
As the people of Rome scrambled for power 
against the senate ; as the people of Athens scram 
bled for more power than was reserved for them by 
the laws of Solon ; as the people of Carthage scram 
bled for power against their senate ; as the people of 
England scrambled for power against the king and 
lords, and set up Oliver; as the people of France 
scrambled for power against every majority and set 
up Robespierre ; so the House of Representatives of 
the United States will scramble for power against the 
President and Senate. And the frequency of popular elections will corrupt all before them. May God 
of his infinite mercy grant that some remedy may be 
found before it be too late, in the good sense of this 
people. 
</p><p>
Mr. C. desires me " to present his most profound 
respects, not daring to send by a husband, any more 
affectionate regards." 
</p><p>
I will venture to present you with my most affectionate regards, my earnest wishes and longing de 
sires to see you.
