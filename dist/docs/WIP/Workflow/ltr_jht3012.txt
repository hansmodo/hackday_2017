SIR, 
</p><p>
I am honored with yours of the 1st instant, and 
although it would have made me very happy to have 
been able to procure a release of all our officers in 
captivity, I freely acknowledge and acquiesce in the 
justice and impartiality of the measures you have 
taken respecting them. 
</p><p>
We have now granted to our proportion of the six 
teen battalions the additional bounty of thirty-three 
dollars and one third, estimating that proportion at 
one thousand men. In making this estimate, we are 
governed by the proportion which the quota assigned 
by Congress to this State bears to the whole number 
to be raised, namely, as eight is to eighty-eight. This 
I trust will put the officers you have appointed in this 
State upon an equal footing with those of the eight 
regiments allotted to us before, and remove every 
impediment in the way of raising their men. 
</p><p>
I am not insensible, that the step taken by the 
New England States, of granting an additional bounty 
to their quotas of the Continental army, is objected 
to, as tending to produce discontent and disorder in 
the army. You will, therefore, permit me to state 
the reasons which have prevailed to induce the giving  it, and the manner in which this State hath been 
drawn in to accede to it. 
</p><p>
The length and severity of our winters in this cli 
mate are such, that a soldier can neither clothe nor 
support himself, or a family, so cheaply at any time 
as he can in a southern climate. Many, indeed most 
of our soldiers, have small families at home dependent, in a good measure, upon the savings they can 
make out of their wages for subsistence, which must 
always be the case while most of our youth many 
at the age of twenty-one years, or thereabouts. The 
almost total interruption of commerce, and the scarcity 
of materials for manufactures, have and must still 
greatly increase the prices of clothing and other articles, whilst the demand for all kinds of provisions for 
the army has likewise rendered every necessary article of subsistence much dearer than at the commencement of hostilities. At that time the wages given to a 
common laborer were about forty shillings per month; 
now ten dollars are rather less than a medium, and all 
articles of produce are risen in proportion. Add that 
the seaman is offered twenty dollars per month, and 
tradesmen and artificers in proportion. Neither is this 
chargeable to any ill principle, but the necessary consequence of drawing off so many of our men into the 
service. When these facts are considered, it was 
thought to be very apparent, that a New England 
soldier cannot, and in justice ought not to serve upon 
the same pay and allowances that were given in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>, or that one from the Southern States, when 
his expense for clothing and subsistence for himself 
and family is so much less, now can. Our people 
in general are so fully persuaded of this difference, 
it is alleged that it would be fruitless, as well as 
unjust, to attempt to engage them upon it, and vain 
to expect success in the attempt. 
</p><p>
These considerations induced the Massachusetts Assembly, in October, to offer an additional monthly pay. 
The Assembly of this State, who had before rejected 
the measure when proposed by some of their own 
members, followed their lead, and offered the same 
additional pay; but when they were advised of the 
disapprobation of Congress, and had your Excellency's 
objections laid before them, they cheerfully retracted, 
and determined to trust to the bounties and pay of 
Congress, with some encouragement in furnishing 
them with necessaries at prime cost, to induce them 
to enlist. In the mean time, all the other New England States offered large additional bounties; Massachusetts and New Hampshire, sixty-six dollars and 
two thirds ; Rhode Island, twenty dollars. It was 
soon evident, that these bounties would entice a great 
part of our men into the service of the States contiguous to us on the east and north, which, besides 
the obstruction which would thence arise to the rilling 
up our own battalions, would be highly prejudicial to 
the agriculture of this State, and, in effect, to the 
general service, as the army must still depend, for a 
very considerable part of its subsistence, on this State. 
</p><p>
In this situation the matter rested until the enemy 
took possession of Newport. It then became necessary to provide for the immediate defence of the New 
England States, and Commissioners met at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
to concert proper measures for that purpose. They 
immediately agreed to raise an army of six thousand 
men for a temporary defence, until the Continental 
army might be raised. 
</p><p>
Sensible that an attempt to raise a separate army 
for their own defence, must effectually obstruct the 
raising a Continental army, and otherwise be liable 
to great objections, they considered raising the continental battalions speedily, as the only sure means 
of defence against the enemy, should they fall upon 
any of these States 5 and proceeded to deliberate upon 
proper measures for this purpose. 
</p><p>
The rapid increase of the prices of the necessaries 
and conveniences of life operates strongly to discourage 
soldiers from enlisting. These they attempted to limit 
by recommending prices to be affixed by law, beyond 
which they might not rise, by recommending that a 
stop be put to emitting further bills of credit, and 
measures to be taken to reduce the quantity now circulating. 
</p><p>
The number of men employed on board privateers 
and merchant vessels, formed another obstacle to raising  an army. They recommended an embargo upon 
all privateers and merchant vessels, except those sent 
after necessaries by permit, until the army was raised. 
The bounties offered by the other States were alleged as an impediment to raising the quota for the 
army in this State and Rhode Island. The Commissioners from this State strongly urged, that the additional bounties should be withdrawn, and encouragement, by supplying necessaries at a certain price, be 
substituted in their place. In this they were over 
ruled; and then, sensible of the mischief that must 
arise from the great bounties given by the other 
States, they consented, in case Massachusetts and 
New Hampshire would reduce their bounty to thirty-three dollars and one third, to recommend to this 
State to give the same bounty to our soldiers, which 
was agreed to, and recommended accordingly. 
</p><p>
Our Assembly, with reluctance, for the sake of 
uniformity, and to avoid what they considered as a 
greater evil, acceded to the recommendation, and 
offered the proposed bounty. 
</p><p>
I must leave the other New England States to 
give their reasons for the measures they have adopted, and only add, that it is my wish and desire that 
all jealousies and occasions of disunion and animosity 
of the several States, may be avoided and laid aside. 
It is not wonderful, that diversity of sentiments hap 
pens at a time that government is so far convulsed 
arid unhinged. It is necessary, as far as possible, to 
become all things to all men, and not suffer our enemies to avail themselves of any discord or disunion 
among these States. I am, Sir, with great truth and 
respect, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
