MY DEAR PORTIA, [<a href='/results.php?year=1780' rel="origin">1780</a>]
</p><p>
YESTERDAY we went to see the garden of the King, Jardin du Roi, and his cabinet of natural history, 
cabinet d histoire naturelle. The cabinet of natural history is a great collection of metals, minerals, shells, insects, birds, beasts, fishes and precious 
stones. They are arranged in good order and pre 
served in good condition, with the name of every 
thing, beautifully written on a piece of paper, annexed 
to it. There is also a collection of woods and marbles. The garden is large and airy, affording fine 
walks between rows of trees. Here is a collection, 
from all parts of the world, of all the plants, roots 
and vegetables that are used in medicine, and indeed 
of all the plants and trees in the world. A fine scene 
for the studious youths in physic and philosophy. It 
was a public day. There was a great deal of company, and I had opportunity only to take a cursory 
view. The whole is very curious. There is a hand 
some statue of M. Buffon, the great natural historian, 
whose works you have, whose labors have given fame 
to this cabinet and garden. When shall we have in 
America such collections ? The collection of American curiosities that I saw at Norwalk, in Connecticut, 
made by <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>Mr. Arnold</a>, which he afterwards, to my 
great mortification, sold to Governor Tryon, convinces me that our country affords as ample materials 
for collections of this nature as any part of the world.

Five midshipmen of the Alliance came here last 
night, Marston, Hogan, Fitzgerald, and two others, 
from Norway, where they were sent with prizes, 
which the court of Denmark were absurd and unjust 
enough to restore to the English. They, however, 
treated the officers and people well, and defrayed 
their expenses. They say the Norwegians were 
very angry with the court of Copenhagen for delivering up these vessels. It was the blunder of ignorance, I believe, rather than any ill will. 
</p><p>
Every day, when I ride out without any particular 
business to do or visit to make, I order my servant to 
carry me to some place where I never was before, so 
that, at last, I believe, I have seen all Paris and all 
the fields and scenes about it that are near it. It is 
very pleasant. Charles is as well beloved here as at 
home. Wherever he goes every body loves him. 
Mr. Dana is as fond of him, I think, as I am. He 
learns very well.

There is a volume in folio just published here, 
which I yesterday ran over at a bookseller's shop. 
It is a description and a copper-plate of all the engravings upon precious stones in the collection of 
the Duke of Orleans. The stamps are extremely 
beautiful, and are representations of the gods and 
heroes of antiquity, with most of the fables of their 
mythology. Such a book would be very useful to 
the children in studying the classics, but it is too 
dear ; three guineas unbound. There is every thing 
here that can inform the understanding or refine the 
taste, and indeed, one would think, that could purify 
the heart. Yet it must be remembered, there is every 
thing here, too, which can seduce, betray, deceive, 
deprave, corrupt and debauch it. Hercules marches 
here in full view of the steeps of virtue on one hand 
and the flowery paths of pleasure on the other, and 
there are few who make the choice of Hercules. 
That my children may follow his example is my ear 
nest prayer ; but I sometimes tremble when I hear 
the siren song of sloth, lest they should be captivated with her bewitching charms, and her soft, insinuating music.
