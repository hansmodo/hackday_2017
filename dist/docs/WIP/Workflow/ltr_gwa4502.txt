TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Count Fersen will do me the favor to deliver this to your Excellency. The operations of this day are over, and I am sorry to say, that I have not had the happiness to succeed to my wishes, although I think 
very essential benefit will result to our future operations from the opportunity I have had, in a very full manner, to reconnoitre the position and works of the 
enemy on the north end of York Island. The particular events of the day I shall do myself the honor to communicate, when I have the pleasure to join your Excellency. 
</p><p>
The American army and the legion of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> will march to-morrow to White Plains. If it will be convenient to you, I shall be happy to receive 
your Excellency with your troops at that place the day after to-morrow. When I shall have an opportunity to converse with your Excellency, I conceive I shall be 
able to give you such reasons for forming your junction at White Plains in the first instance, as will satisfy you of the utility and fitness of the position for 
commencing the preparations for concerted operations of the campaign. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &lc.
