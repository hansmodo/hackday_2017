MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you the garrison surrendered 
last night. This morning, we take possession ; to-morrow, I hope 
the prisoners will set off. Inclosed you have the capitulation, 
which I hope will meet your approbation and that of Congress. 
</p><p>
I have ventured to permit an officer or two to go to their 
families, which are in some distress, at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, upon their pa 
role. They can t do us any harm, and there would have been 
a degree of inhumanity in refusing them. When we had played 
on the fort some hours from our battery of four twelve-pounders, 
on the north-west, and another, of two twelve-pounders and two 
four-pounders, on the east side, some prisoners arrived who had 
been taken in an action with Governor Carleton, at Longueil. He 
made an attempt to land with thirty-four boats, full of men. 
Warner's detachment, consisting of the Green Mountain Boys 
and second regiment of Yorkers, repulsed them with loss ; took 
two Indians and two Canadians prisoners. We have buried three 
Indians, and it is supposed many in the boats must have been 
killed ; we had not a man even wounded. This, I believe, is his 
last effort. 
</p><p>
One of the above-mentioned prisoners I sent into the fort to 
inform Major Preston of the circumstances of the action, that he 
might judge what prospect he had of relief. It had the desired 
effect; the garrison having been on half allowance for some time. 
</p><p>
I am making the necessary preparation to proceed immediately 
to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, by way of Laprairie, as the enemy have armed vessels in the Sorel. Send everybody you possibly can immediately 
down, as it is much to be apprehended many of the men on this service will insist on returning home when their times are Expired. It will not be necessary to keep people with arms for the 
present at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>. Several men of rank in Canada are 
among the prisoners. I have permitted them to remain at Crown 
Point till the return of two gentlemen they send to their friends 
for money, &c. They pleaded hard to return home ; but they 
are too dangerous to let loose again. 
</p><p>
I have this moment received your letter of the 27th October. 
Not a word of Arnold yet. I have sent two expresses to him 
lately ; one by an Indian, who promised to return with expedition. The instant I have any news of him, I will acquaint you 
by express. 
</p><p>
Colonel Easton and Major Brown, with that corps, and Mr. 
Livingston, with, I believe, one thousand Canadians, are going to 
wards the mouth of the Sorel, and pushing Colonel Allan Mc 
Lean before them. McLean had many Canadians, but they 
joined him through fear of fire and sword; you may judge easily 
how they will fight. I send you a list of stores, articles, &c., 
and am, my dear Sir, with respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your much obliged, humble servant, 
</p><p>

Neither Macpherson nor Rensselaer have commissions. 
</p><p>
P. S. Half after six. Just received your favor of the 31st 
October; a good deal of artillery stores, but we have not time 
to ascertain them.
