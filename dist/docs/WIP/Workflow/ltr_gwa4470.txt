Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am glad to find, that you have received the necessary papers, and are entering upon the measures for interrupting the enemy's communications. I hope you 
will be enabled, by the assistance of the person proposed, if he is found sufficiently faithful and intelligent, to prosecute those measures to good effect ; because I 
think the intelligence obtained through that channel of Count d'Estainnr, and commanded his vanguard when he forced the 
entrance of tins harbour." â€” .Yewport, May SIh. 
</p><p>
The following is an extract from the instructions sent by the Minister 
of War to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, dated Versailles, March 7th. 
</p><p>
1. It is the intention of his Majesty, that you do not abandon Rhode 
Island, if the squadron destined to act in concert with you for its defence 
cannot retire to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> without hazard, or before it shall be relieved from 
its defensive position at Rhode Island by a superior naval force. 
</p><p>
2. I will inform you, that, in the month of July or August, the superior naval force of which you have just received notice, will withdraw the 
squadron of M. de Barras from the harbour of Rhode Island ; and you 
will carefully reserve to yourself the knowledge of this arrangement, 
which may be accelerated. 
</p><p>
3. If, by unforeseen events, or any cause whatever, the army of 
Washington should be broken up and dispersed, it is the intention of the 
King, that, under these circumstances, you should decline acceding to 
any orders or requests of that general to penetrate into the interior of 
the continent ; as in that case it would be prudent to reserve yourself, 
and to retire to the Antilles if possible, or to St Domingo, according to 
the season. 
</p><p>
4. If, on the contrary, the American army remains in its present 
slate, and yet without being able to undertake any combined operation 
with the squadron ; and if this latter should attempt any other enterprise, 
where the concurrence of a certain number of land forces would be required, the King leaves it in your power to furnish them, provided that 
the plan be concerted with the American general. 
</p><p>
5. Should there be an opportunity for the squadron at Rhode Island 
to act independently of the American army, you are aware that the naval 
forces of the King should concur in all operations, which are considered 
advantageous to the common cause. 
</p><p>
6. You are also aware, that, as long as the King's troops occupy Rhode Island, the transports destined to receive the troops are to be 
kept there ; when, on the contrary, the army under your command shall 
penetrate into the country, and the squadron abandons Rhode Island, 
this squadron will proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and take with it the transports, 
that have been retained. 
</p><p>
7. If, from the different causes mentioned, you should remain in 
your position at Rhode Island, and a superior naval force of the King 
should withdraw the squadron which is in that port, I give you notice, 
that the Count de Grasse has orders to leave with you two vessels to 
defend the port, and the transports necessary for your army.
</p><p>
I have been exceedingly distressed by the repeated accounts I have received of the sufferings of the troops on the frontier, and the terrible consequences which 
must ensue, unless they were speedily supplied. What gave a particular poignancy to the sting I felt on the 
occasion was my inability to afford relief. Such partial supplies as were on hand, to the very last barrel of meat, I ordered instantly to be sent, and have promised 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> what further succour the States will enable me to give. Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a> has gone to the several eastern States, to enforce my pointed representations, to rouse them to more vigorous exertions, 
and to make arrangements for supplies during the whole campaign. I cannot but hope this measure will 
be attended with success. I am, &,c.
