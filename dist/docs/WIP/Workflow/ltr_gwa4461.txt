Sir, 
</p><p>
I assure your Excellency, that I feel extreme pain at 
the occasion of that part of your letter of the 26th 
instant, which relates to an intercepted letter of mine 
published by the enemy. I am unhappy that an accident should have put it in their power to give to the 
world any thing from me, which may contain an implication the least disagreeable to you, or to the Chevalier 
Destouches. I assume you sincerely, that I have no 
copy of the original letter in my possession, so that I 
am unable by a comparison to determine how far the 
publication may be just. The enemy have fabricated 
w hole letters for me, and even a series of letters ; and 
it is not improbable that they may have given a different 
turn to some of my expressions in the present instance. 
It would however be disingenuous in me not to acknowledge, that I believe the general import to be true. 
The copy, however, which your Excellency has sent to 
me, differs in some respects from that which the enemy 
have publish'd, as you will perceive by the enclosed 
Gazette. Whatever construction it may bear, I beg your Excellency will consider the letter as private to 
a friend, a gendeman who has the direction of my affairs at home, totally unconnected with public affairs, 
and on whose discretion I could absolutely rely. No idea of the same kind has ever gone to any public body. 
</p><p>
When I say, that I believe the general import of the 
publication to be true, I mean it in this sense, that there 
did appear to me a degree of delay in executing the 
enterprise suggested by me, of the causes of which 
I was not well apprized, and an idea of this kind was 
probably expressed in my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>Mr. Washington</a>. 
As to the apparent insinuation, that the first expedition 
had been preferred to the one proposed by me, I could 
not have intended to convey it, in its fullest latitude, 
because it would have been unjust. I could not but 
have recollected, that my formal proposal did not reach 
you till after the departure of the first squadron, though 
the suggestion of it was previous. ]My letter however 
was written in haste, and might have been inaccurately 
expressed. I have lately learnt, though not officially, 
that the cause of the delay I have alluded to was a 
want of supplies for the fleet. Impressed with a real 
esteem for and confidence in the Chevalier Destouches, 
I have heard this circumstance with satisfaction. 
</p><p>
With this explanation, I leave the matter to his candor and to yours, and flatter myself it will make no 
impressions inconsistent with an entire persuasion of 
my sincere esteem and attachment. I have the honor 
to be, with perfect respect, &,c. 
</p>
