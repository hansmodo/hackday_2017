IF alarming half a dozen places at the same time is an act of generalship, Howe may boast of his late conduct. We have never, since the evacuation of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, been under apprehensions of an invasion from them, equal to what we suffered last week. All <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> was in confusion, packing up and carting 
out of town household furniture, military stores, goods, &c. Not less than a thousand teams were employed on Friday and Saturday ; and, to their shame 
be it told, not a small trunk would they carry under eight dollars, and many of them, I am told, asked a 
hundred dollars a load ; for carting a hogshead of molasses eight miles, thirty dollars. O human nature ! or rather, O inhuman nature ! what art thou? 
The report of the fleet s being seen off Cape Ann Friday night gave me the alarm, and, though pretty 
weak, I set about packing up my things, and on Saturday removed a load.

When I looked around me and beheld the bounties of Heaven so liberally bestowed, in fine n%ds of 
corn, grass, flax, and English grain, and thought it might soon become a prey to these merciless ravagers, our habitations laid waste, and, if our flight 
preserved our lives, we must return to barren fields, empty barns, and desolate habitations, if any we 
find, (perhaps not where to lay our heads,) my heart was too full to bear the weight of affliction which I 
thought just ready to overtake us, and my body too weak almost to bear the shock, unsupported by my better half. 
</p><p>
But, thanks be to Heaven, we are at present relieved from our fears respecting ourselves. I now 
feel anxious for your safety, but hope prudence will direct to a proper care and attention to yourselves. 
May this second attempt of Howe s prove his utter ruin. May destruction overtake him as a whirlwind.

We have a report of an engagement at the north ward, in which our troops behaved well, drove the enemy into their lines, killed and took three hundred and fifty prisoners. The account came in last night. I have not particulars. We are under apprehensions that the Hancock is taken.

Your obliging letters of the 8th, 10th, and 13th, came to hand last week. I hope before this time 
you are relieved from the anxiety you express for your bosom friend. I feel my sufferings amply rewarded, in the tenderness you express for me. But, 
in one of your letters, you have drawn a picture which drew a flood of tears from my eyes, and 
wrung my heart with anguish inexpressible. I pray Heaven, I may not live to realize it. 
</p><p>
It is almost thirteen years since we were united, but not more than half that time have we had the 
happiness of living together. The unfeeling world may consider it in what light they please. I consider it as a sacrifice to my country, and one of my greatest misfortunes, to be separated from my children, at a time of life when the joint instructions and 
admonition of parents sink deeper than in maturer years. 
</p><p>
The hope of the smiles and approbation of my friend sweetens all my toils and labors. 
</p><p>
Ye Powers, whom men and birds obey, 
Great rulers of your creatures, say 
Why mourning comes, by bliss conveyed, 
And even the sweets of love allayed. 
Where grows enjoyment tall and fair, 
Around it twines entangling care ; 
</p><p>
While fear for what our sons possess 
Enervates every power to bless. 
Yet friendship forms the bliss above, 
And, life, what art thou without love?"
