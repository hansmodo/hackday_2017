My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I thank you for your kind letter of the 30th of last 
month, and the American Code of Public Law. I 
have given this book not such a reading as I wished, 
but such as my time permitted, and think it contains 
all the fundamental laws of a federative republic. 
</p><p>
It is the part of the wise legislative body to make 
the union of the states perpetual by procuring it the 
sanction of popular opinion. 
</p><p>
If the majority of the people in each state, or only 
the majority of the states, can he persuaded that it is 
a religious duty, as was the case of the Greeks with 
respect to the Amphictionic League, or a duty to 
themselves as most favouring their private and 
political interests to maintain the confederation, it 
will he established upon the most permanent basis 
that human affairs admit of, and the opinion propagated by education will pass to remote posterity. I 
shall study these laws with the greatest attention in my retirement. 
</p><p>
We have received several accounts from outposts 
within a few days past intimating that an attack upon 
us was meditated. We have in consequence prepared 
ourselves, paraded our men so as to make them 
acquainted with their ground and its advantages ; but 
the enemy have remained within their works. Many 
are of opinion that's r W m Howe will not sutler any 
thing but mere necessity, or a very tempting prospect 
of decisive success, to call him from good winter 
quarters. Others say that from past experience lie 
knows the vicinity of the Continental army to be 
exceedingly troublesome, and that it is his interest to 
drive us to a more respectable distance. In the mean 
time the season advances in which armies in General are forced to repair to more substantial shelter than 
tents, and whose inclemency is more particularly 
grievous to our ill-clothed soldiers. The question is 
whether we are to go into remote winter quarters, 
and form a chain of cantonments in the interior part 
of the country ; leaving a vast extent of territory ex 
posed to the devastation of an enraged unsparing 
enemy ; leaving inhabitants who will be partly seduced 
by the expectation of gold, or more generally compell'd 
to fill the traitorous provincial corps now raising; 
leaving plentiful granaries and large stocks of cattle, 
ample means for subsisting the troops and Tory citizens in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and for victualling transports 
that may carry home Mr Burgoyne and his army; 
leaving the well affected to fall a sacrifice, and deplore 
our abandonment of them and the country; or, 
whether we shall take a position more honourable, more 
military, more republican, more consonant to the 
popular wish in a proper situation for covering the 
country, or at least so much of it as circumstances will 
permit and for distressing and annoying the Enemy ?

Winter campaigns it is said are ominous to the best 
appointed and best disciplined armies. The misery 
incident to them occasions desertion and sickness 
which waste their numbers. Our army in particular 
requires exemption from fatigue in order to compensate for their want of clothing. 
</p><p>
Relaxation from the duties of a campaign, in order 
to allow them an opportunity of being disciplined and 
instructed ; warm quarters, that it may appear in the 
spring with undiminished numbers and in the full 
</p><p>
prowess of health, &ca. Besides it is urged that the 
hardships which our soldiers undergo discourage men 
from enlisting. The answers that might be given in 
our particular circumstances to these general objections against winter campaigns are only for your 
private ear, and not to be trusted in a letter to the possibility of miscarriage ; besides, we may take a position 
which will not absolutely expose us to a winter 
campaign, but furnish us excellent quarters for men 
at the same time that it leaves us within distance for 
taking considerable advantages of the enemy, and 
cover a valuable and extensive country.

As I hear that the Chevalier Failly intends for York, 
and it seems to be a matter of doubt whether any 
dispatches will go from head quarters to-day, I ll 
finish my letter and send it by him.

Gen'l Dickinson made a descent some days ago on 
Staten Island which, if lie had not been betrayed, 
would have thrown into his hands some very valuable 
prisoners and a large number of common ones. As it 
was, he took 2 lieutenants and 25 privates ; made a 
secure retreat, and lost only two or three kill'd and 
wounded.

The triumviral committee from Congress arrived this evening. As much as I desire to see you, my dear father, I fear an interview cannot be effected for 
some time to come. Col. Hamilton who was sent to the Northern army to explain the necessity for reinforcements from thence, lies dangerously ill on the 
road. Since the battle of German Town, I have no longer been a supernumerary. 
</p><p>
My heart is ever with you, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
