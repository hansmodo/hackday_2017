DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Early this morning, the Phoenix man-of-war, Rose 
frigate, and the two tenders, came to sail, and stood 
down the river, keeping close under the east shore, 
in order to avoid the fire of our cannon. But, not 
withstanding this precaution, the Phoenix was thrice 
hulled, by our shot from <a href='/results.php?city=mount washington' rel='city'>Mount Washington</a>, -and one 
of the tenders once. The Rose was hulled once by 
a shot from Burdett's Ferry. They kept their men 
close, otherwise some of them would have been 
picked down by a party of riflemen, who were posted 
on the bank. They fired grape-shot as they passed, 
but did no damage save to one tent. We hope to 
hear that your batteries have done the work for 
some of them. 
</p><p>
We shall recover some swivel-guns, gun-barrels, 
shot, &c., out of the wreck of the tender, which was 
burnt the other night, the particulars of which shall 
be transmitted to your Excellency as soon as I can 
obtain them. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> has about fourteen 
hundred men already come in, but their quarters are 
so scattered, that it will be almost impossible to collect them suddenly, if occasion should require it. If 
there are any spare tents, I earnestly beg for them, 
if it were but for one regiment. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> 
has orders from the Convention of the State of New 
York to purchase ten thousand feet of boards, for 
erecting sheds, &c., but it is uncertain when we shall 
have them. I shall, to-morrow, send for six or seven 
hundred of tools, being able to employ that number more than we have at present. The more I view this post, the more I am convinced of its importance. 
</p><p>
The ships have now tried the practicability of passing  our works. They have explored every part of 
the shore, as far as they have gone up the river, 
and sounded the river in almost every place. Should 
the ships rejoin the fleet without receiving much da 
mage, I think Howe will be emboldened to attempt 
an attack somewhere above this place, thinking 
that there may be a greater probability of succeeding  here, than in the face of so many and strong 
works as have been erected in and around the city. 
However, should his inclination lead him this way, 
nature has done much for us, and we shall, as fast 
as possible, add the strength of art. Our men are in 
good health and spirits, and I dare say will give 
them a warm reception. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to have the carriages for the 
four-pounders sent forward the moment they are 
done, as we have not as yet a single cannon mounted beyond <a href='/results.php?city=mount washington' rel='city'>Mount Washington</a>. I have just now received your Excellency's commands to inquire into 
the cause of the inactivity of some of the row-galleys, in the late attack on the enemy's ships ; but 
as the galleys have all left this post, and fallen down 
to the city, I must beg your Excellency to excuse 
me from that service. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
