Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received the letter, which you addressed to me on 
the 29th of last month. 
</p><p>
The affection of the French Republic for the United States 
is too marked to admit the possibility of an unfavorable interpretation being given to the accident, which befel you on the 
28th instant. The precautionary measures taken on that day 
extended to all the inhabitants of the city of Paris, and a proof 
that they had no reference to you personally is, that at the moment your name and rank were known, you obtained the justice due to you. 
</p><p>
The domiciliary visits were an equally general measure, 
from which no house in Paris was exempt. I see with pleasure, that the Commissaries of the Section, who entered your 
house, withdrew after the explanation you gave them. The 
respect, which they have shown you, is proof of the belief of 
my fellow citizens, that the Minister of a free nation, an ally of 
France, is incapable of receiving into his house disaffected 
persons. The exemption, which you claim, would have had 
the pernicious effect of affording the ill disposed a facility for 
calumniating your motives, in order to disturb the entire harmony, which subsists between the two nations. 
</p><p>
I herewith send the papers, which you requested me to authenticate. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p><p>
