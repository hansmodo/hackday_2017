MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
WE arrived here last night, all alive, but all very near 
sick with violent colds taken on the road for want of 
comfortable accommodations. I was advised on all 
hands to come by land rather than wait an uncertain 
time for a passage by sea. But if I had known the 
difficulties of travelling in that part of Spain which I 
have passed through, I think I should not have ventured upon the journey. It is in vain to attempt a 
description of our passage. Through the province of 
Gallicia, and again when we came to that of Biscay, 
we had an uninterrupted succession of mountains ; 
through that of Leon and the old Castile, constant 
plains. A country tolerably good by nature, but not 
well cultivated. Through the whole of the journey 
the taverns were inconvenient to us, because there 
are no chimneys in their houses, and we had cold 
weather. A great part of the way, the wretchedness 
of our accommodation exceeds all description. 
</p><p>
At <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a> we fare very well, and have received 
much civility from Messrs. Gardoqui and Sons, as we 
did at <a href='/results.php?city=ferrol' rel='city'>Ferrol</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=corunna' rel='city'>Corunna</a> from M. de Tournelle and 
M. Lagoanere. I wish I could send you some few 
things for the use of the family from hence, but the 
risk is such, that I believe I had better wait until we 
get to France. I have undergone the greatest anxiety for the children through a tedious journey and 
voyage. I hope their travels will be of service to 
them, but those at home are best off. My love to 
them. 
</p><p>
Adieu, adieu, 
</p><p>
