My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have read with pleasure the report of the commit 
tee of Congress, on the subject of the insulting and 
insidious overtures made by the British ministers, tho 
I think more firmness and energy would have made 
it more republican. The pardons offered to the subjects of the states who had embraced the party of the 
enemy, will, I am persuaded, be attended with extensive good consequences. The measure is dictated by 
policy, and unites the advantage of being founded in 
humanity. A few copies of the handbill have been 
sent to Governor Tryon in return for the triplicate 
packets of the British bill which he was so obliging as 
to send to the Commander in Chief. It appears to me 
that this proceeding of L'd North will be the signal for 
France to declare war. The reducing the commerce 
and naval power of her natural enemy, increasing her 
own, and humbling an inveterate rival, are objects too 
important in a political view, for her to hazard them 
to the wiles of negociation after they have been 
secured from the chance of war. This apart, the 
death of the Elector of Bavaria, it is generally thought 
will embroil Europe. And if our men in power, and 
men of influence, will redouble their exertions instead 
of being lulled into security, the new and artful 
attack of the British minister, will be foiled and 
expose him to contempt. He will be obliged to with 
draw his troops I mean as many of them as we suffer to escape and tacitly to acknowledge what he 
will be afterwards forced explicitly to ratify our 
independence. At the same time, if no secret alliance 
has been entered into on our part with France, our 
agents at that court need not represent it as an impossible event, that a treaty should take place between 
Great Britain and America, from the degree of affection which may still remain between the two nations 
and the propensity to a connexion which arises from 
the indentity of habits and language. 
</p><p>
I have been informed that the tone of our embassadors was infinitely too modest to produce the effects 
which we had a right to expect. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to find that Congress has directed <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='co-worker'>General Gates</a> to have a conference with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker friend met'>Gen'l Washington</a> previous to his setting out for his 
northern command. A proper force kept up in the 
neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, provided it can be done 
without prejudice to this army, may be attended with 
very important good consequences. 
</p><p>
It is a favourite plan with some men, to make a 
sudden attempt in that quarter with a part of this 
army, and change the theatre of the war; but there 
are many irrefragable arguments against the project. 
Their plan is to carry that city by storm ; but the 
preliminary steps to be taken, and the length of march 
would inevitably betray the design. The part of the 
army left here would be attacked and dissipated by 
a superior force. The British army would be recruited from among the numerous disaffected, which 
swarm in this state, and the force before <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
if sufficient to proceed by regular approaches, would 
be obliged to raise the siege with disgrace, upon reinforcements being thrown in, which might very well 
be spared from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; besides, as <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
supposing it carried, cannot be maintained while the 
enemy have the superiority by sea, it can by no means 
deserve to be made a principal object of attention. 
But if we are sufficiently strengthened here to act 
offensively, and a respectable force is posted in the 
vicinity of N". York, we may hope for decisive success, and we avoid the risk of suffering the enemy to 
establish themselves, and strengthen their party in 
this state; cut off the communication between the 
northern and southern states, and reduce the Congress 
to the disgraceful necessity of decamping a second 
time. I say nothing of the unavoidable loss of stores, 
whatever diligence may be used in removing them. 
</p><p>
I must ask, my dear father, a thousand pardons for 
this ill-digested and incoherent letter. I set out with 
a good intention, but from my first beginning it till 
now, I have undergone perpetual interruption. 
</p><p>
Cap 6 G-ibbes has disappointed me in not purchasing 
the stuff for summer wear. I must entreat you to let 
James procure me as much as will make two or three 
changes, provided the extravagance of the price does 
not forbid it. 
</p><p>
Adieu my dearest friend and father, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">JOHN LAURENS</a>.
</p><p>
I send a letter which you will be so good as to inclose by Mr. Francis, to Col Gervaise, to be for warded.
