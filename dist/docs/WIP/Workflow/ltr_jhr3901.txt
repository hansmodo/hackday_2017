Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen: 
</p><p>
On the 7th of May I was informed, by a letter from the Committee of Secrecy, War and Intelligence, in North Carolina, of their having 
received advice that the enemy, who then lay in Cape Fear River, had planned a descent at the mouth of Little River, near the borders of 
this colony, in order to attempt a passage into the back country of that, by the Lake of Waccamaw. Having occasion to confer with the Hon. 
Colonel Powell on this subject, he urged very strongly to me the absolute necessity of building a stockade fort, and keeping a garrison, at 
the Cheraw Hill, as a security against incursions of the disaffected about Cross Creek, and for preventing or suppressing insurrections, 
which they might occasion amongst our own people, near the North Carolina line events which, he feared, especially, if the intended junction between the British forces and the malcontents in that province; 
had taken place. I thought so much attention and respect due to the representation of a gentleman in his station, who was well acquainted 
with that part of the country, and had the command of a large regiment there, as to lay it before the council for their advice, which I did. 
He attended them, and on considering what he offered on this head, they were unanimously of opinion that it was necessary to erect a fort, 
and keep only a garrison, in consequence of which I gave orders for that purpose.
