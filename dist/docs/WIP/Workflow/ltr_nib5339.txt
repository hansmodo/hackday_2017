My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I stated to you, last year, my views in regard to Texas; and you then thought that if the plan of annexation to the 
United States could be abandoned, every consideration of feeling &amp; interest would conspire to make us desire its prosperity. That question is now settled. Mr Jones, the new 
Minister, arrived two days ago in Phil'a ., and he is instructed to withdraw the proposal of union. This troublesome part 
of the question being thus disposed of, I am much inclined to think that if their loan of Five millions were taken in the 
United States, it would be far better than if they were obliged to seek it in England. I do not however wish to mix 
myself with the political contests of the day nor to interfere in matters which have been the subject of party warfare; and V 
I should like to have the benefit of the opinions of judicious friends before doing something final in respect to it. Will you 
then say, whatever you feel at liberty to say, in the question, whether it would not be greatly for the interest of our common country that Texas should continue independent of all foreign nations, that she should be protected by this country and not permitted, if possible, to owe her prosperity to any other aid than ours. Say, too, whether your opinion is 
that Texas can maintain its independence, or whether, in the 
last extremity, this country would permit her to be conquered, or reconquered; and, being free, whether you think 
a loan to her would be perfectly safe. You will readily understand, by the strain of these remarks, that I am predisposed 
Go serve Texas, because I believe I should benefit our country by it; but, before taking any decisive step, I would wish 
to have your judgment, because I know that your opinion will be an impartial and a patriotic one. If any circumstance, 
public or private, indisposes you to answer, I request that you will not answer. But if you incline to speak, speak for 
I think the occasion worthy of you. and so speak that if, when I have decided, I should want the benefit of your judgment to 
sanction my course, I may have it and use it publicly or privately. I will only add that what you say I wish you to say quickly.
