DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Some time ago I informed you of my intentions to make my 
approaches on the west side, as soon as the expected reenforcement enabled me to undertake it. I had had a road cut to the 
intended ground, and some fascines made, when I was informed 
by Major Brown, that a general dissatisfaction prevailed ; that 
unless something was undertaken in a few days, there would 
be a mutiny ; and that the universal sense of the army was to 
direct all our attention to the east side. The impatience of the 
troops to get home has prevented their seeing the impossibility 
of undertaking this business sooner, the duty being hard for the 
troops, even on the present confined state of operations. 
</p><p>
When I mentioned my intentions, I did not consider I was at 
the head of troops who carry the spirit of freedom into the field, 
and think for themselves. Upon considering the fatal consequences which might flow from a want of subordination and discipline (should this ill humor continue), my unstable authority 
over troops of different Colonies, the insufficiency of the military 
law, and my own want of powers to enforce it, weak as it is, I 
thought it expedient to call the Field-Officers together. Inclosed 
I send you the result of our deliberations.

Result of the Proceedings of a Council of War, held at <a href='/results.php?city=st johns' rel='city'>St. John's</a>, 
October 13th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
I proposed establishing a battery of all our spare heavy can 
non, on the rising ground exactly opposite the stone house in the 
north redoubt (in the west face of which there is but one embrasure open), at the distance of about four hundred yards, securing 
this battery with a work capable of being well defended by 
two hundred men. From this battery our approaches might be 
continued to the ditch, and by the time we arrived there, the 
fraise around the berme would be destroyed, the rampart in a 
ruinous state, and the large house (which is said to be their 
principal barrack) would be destroyed, as every shot that missed the rampart, must take the house. Two four-pounders on 
the east side would answer the end of securing the west ram 
part in reverse, and thereby slackening the opposition of the 
enemy. 
</p><p>
By this mode of proceeding, if our ammunition held out, there 
would be, in my opinion, some prospect of success, notwithstanding  the superior artillery of the garrison, which could not be 
mounted in its proper place in time enough to prevent the 
erection of our battery. The Field-Officers were, to a man, of 
opinion that my reasons were insufficient, being afraid the designed ground was at this season too wet for approaches, and 
strongly of opinion our heavy cannon on the cast side would 
more effectually distress the enemy by annoying their buildings, 
the fort having a gentle slope to the river, and (which was 
urged as the strongest motive) by destroying their schooner. In 
vain I represented, that even if every building was destroyed, 
the garrison would not surrender without a probability of an 
assault, which could never arise from any attack on the opposite side of the river ; that the vessel could not be destroyed, 
because she would change her place in such a manner as to 
elude our batteries ; that we had little powder or time to throw 
away on experiments; that I had a moral certainty they would find themselves mistaken ; and finally that they must take it 
upon themselves, for I would not oppose the general sense of 
the army, and should enforce the measure by every effort in 
my power. 
</p><p>
I cannot help observing, to how little purpose I am here. 
Were I not afraid the example would be too generally followed, 
and that the public service might suffer, I would not stay an 
hour at the head of troops whose operations I cannot direct. 
I must say I have no hopes of success, unless from the garrison's wanting provisions.
