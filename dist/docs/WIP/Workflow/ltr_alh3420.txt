SIR, 
</p><p>
The explanation which you give of your intention, in your late offer, makes it an object that will compensate fully for the time that it will deduct from my other 
occupations. In accepting it, I have only one scruple, 
arising from a doubt whether the service I can render in 
the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the 
compensation. The whole system, (if it may be so called,) 
of taxation in this state, is radically vicious, burthensome 
to the people, and unproductive to government. As the 
matter now stands, there seems to be little for a continental receiver to do. The whole business appears to be 
thrown into the hands of the county treasurers ; nor do I 
find that there is any appropriation made of any part of the 
taxes collected for continental purposes, or any provision 
to authorize payment to the officer you appoint. This, 
however, must be made. There is only one way in which 
I can imagine a prospect of being materially useful ; that 
is, in seconding your applications to the state. In popular assemblies much may sometimes be brought about by 
personal discussions, by entering into details, and combating objections as they rise. If it should, at any time, be 
thought advisable by you to empower me to act in this capacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends 
upon me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, 
sir, I need not profess that I suggest this, not from a desire 
to augment the importance of office, but to advance the 
public interest. 
</p><p>
It is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to 
take my station in the law, and on this consideration I am 
pressing to qualify myself for admission the next term, 
which will be the latter end of July. After this, should you 
think an interview necessary, I will wait upon you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. In the mean time, I shall be happy to receive your 
instructions, and shall direct my attention more particularly 
to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my future operations. I have read your publications at different 
times, but as I have not the papers containing them in my 
possession, it will be necessary that their contents should 
be comprised in your instructions. A meeting of the legislature is summoned early in the next month, at which, if I 
previously receive your orders, it may be possible to put 
matters in train. I am truly indebted to you, sir, for the 
disposition you have manifested upon this occasion, and I 
shall only add an assurance of my endeavours to justify your 
confidence.
