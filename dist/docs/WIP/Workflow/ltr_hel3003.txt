SIR. 
</p><p>
The newspapers which I received, from your Excellency, in company with the honor of your Excellency's letter of the 18th, afford me sometimes amusement in intervals from the necessary duties of my 
present station ; and I am particularly indebted to 
your Excellency for the notice which is included in 
the kindness of this favor. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the 
integrity of your own heart, and too well assured of 
the good opinion of your countrymen., to admit any 
anxious impression from the forgeries of an enemy. 
I am disposed to vote for every exertion in our power, in order to defeat their designs against us, 
except following such of their examples as will, when 
related in history, greatly abate from that character 
for generosity, which England, and upon good ground, 
once boasted. The late attempt, by publishing forged 
resolves of Congress within a garrisoned town, immediately under the eye of a Commander-in-chief, appears to me to be mean and scandalous, and must be 
considered in the same light by every good English 
man, military, or in public or private life. 
</p><p>
We are now 7 verging towards a most important 
crisis, when all the wisdom of these States will be 
required. Permit me, Sir, to lay before you my private sentiments. If the time shall come for appointing a deputation for treating with British Commissioners on terms for establishing peace, 1 hold it necessary that able men be called forth for that purpose from any place within the Union, without con 
fining our election within any one State or body. I 
entreat your Excellency's pardon for this freedom, and 
that you will believe me m to be, with the most sincere esteem and attachment, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged, and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
