Sir, 
</p><p>
I have this moment received and read your very 
obliging letter of this date, expressing your entire approbation of my conduct in the conference, which, by 
your orders, I have lately held with the Seneca Indians. 
This explicit and pointed approbation of my proceedings, is the more grateful, because they were my first 
essay; for, till then, I was an utter stranger to the 
manners of Indians, and to the proper mode of treating with them. But, Sir, I have found that they are 
not difficult to please. A man must he destitute of 
humanity, of honesty, or of common sense, who should 
send them away disgusted. Pie must want sensibility, 
if he did not sympathize with them, on their recital 
of the injuries they have experienced from white men. 
Impressed, therefore, with such sentiments, the honorable manner in which you have manifested your approbation of my conduct in this business, is more 
than I expected, though, next to the approbation of 
my own mind, nothing could have given me more 
satisfaction. 
</p><p>
With sincere respect, I am, Sir, &c.
