DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
As I have not heard a syllable from you, or <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel=''>General Putnam</a>, 
for a week past, I conclude you are in no want of any further 
assistance from me. Colonel Malcom promised to write as soon 
as he saw your Excellency. I have a sloop gone with a flag of 
truce to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, on board of which is the widow Cortlandt 
Schuyler, her family, servants, &c., with Lieutenant Swords and 
his family. The sloop is commanded by Captain Van Buren. 
Colonel H. B. Livingston, who went in the bateau that carried 
Lord Viscount Petersham, Aid-de-camp to Lientenant-General 
Burgoyne, has my orders to see you upon his return from General Vaughan, to whom he carried a letter from me. Captain 
Van Buren will also make you his report as lie passes New 
Windsor. I am exceedingly impatient to hear from the south 
and the south-west. I am happy to tell you, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel=''>General Lincoln</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel=''>General Arnold</a> are both in a fair way of recovery. 
I am, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most affectionate, humble servant, 
</p><p>
