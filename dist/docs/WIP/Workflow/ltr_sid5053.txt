Sir, 
</p><p>
In obedience to the orders of Congress of the 8th of <a rel="month origin" value="12">December</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, which I received the 4th of March, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>, I embraced the first opportunity of returning to America, 
and on my arrival repaired with all possible despatch to Congress on the 13th of July last, since which time I have attended their orders in this city. I beg leave to remind 
Congress, that early in January, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, I had the honor of being engaged by their committee to go as their agent to 
France, to transact important business for them, in the commercial as well as political departments, and that I have 
ever since been in their service, in which I flatter myself I have been of some utility to them and to my country ; but that an absence of almost four years from my family 
and private affairs, more than seven months of which I have waited to know their pleasure respecting me here, has so exceedingly embarrassed and distressed me, that I hope I 
shall not be deemed guilty of an unbecoming impatience in pressing to know, if Congress have any further commands for me, and in what manner my past transactions, as their 
agent and commissioner, are to be adjusted and closed. I have heretofore written repeatedly and particularly to Congress on this subject, and will not enlarge upon it at present, 
but have the honor to be, with the utmost respect, etc.
