DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine of January 9, I wrote to you that I believed, 
notwithstanding the clamour against America had been 
greatly increased by the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> proceedings, we should 
attempt this session to obtain the repeal of the restraining 
act relating to paper money. The change of the administration with regard to American affairs, which was agreed 
on some time before the new secretary kissed hands and 
entered upon business, made it impossible to go forward 
with that affair, as the minister quitting that department 
would not, and his successor could not engage in it ; but now 
our friends the merchants have been moving in it, and some 
of them have conceived hopes, from the manner in which 
Lord Hillsborough attended to their representations. It 
had been previously concluded among us, that if the repeal 
was to be obtained at all, it must be proposed in the light of 
a favour to the merchants of this country, and asked for by 
them, not by the agents as a favour to America. But as my 
Lord had, at sundry times before he came into his present 
station, discoursed with me on the subject, and got from me 
a copy of my answer to his report, when at the head of the 
Board of Trade, which some time since he thanked me for, 
and said he would read again and consider carefully, I waited 
upon him this morning, partly with intent to learn if he had 
changed his sentiments. 
</p><p>
We entered into the subject, and had a long conversation 
upon it, in which all the arguments he used, against the legal 
tender of paper money, were intended to demonstrate, that 
it was for the benefit of the people themselves to have no such 
money current among them ; and it was strongly his opinion, 
that after the experience of being without it a few years we 
should all be convinced of this truth, as he said, the New 
England colonies now were ; they having lately, on the rumor 
of an intended application for taking off the restraint, petitioned here that it might be continued as to them. However, his Lordship was pleased to say, that if such application 
was made for the three colonies of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as I proposed, it should have fair play, he 
would himself give it no sort of opposition, but he was sure 
it would meet with a great deal, and he thought it could not 
succeed. He was pleased to make me compliments upon 
my paper, assuring me he had read it with a great deal of 
attention, that I had said much more in favour of such a currency than he thought could be said, and all he believed that 
the subject would admit of ; but that it had not on the whole 
changed his opinion, any further than to induce him to leave 
the matter now to the judgment of others, and let it take its 
course, without opposing it as last year he had determined 
to have done. 
</p><p>
I go into the city to-morrow, to confer with the merchants 
again upon it; that if they see any hopes, we may at least 
try the event : but I own my expectations are now very slender, 
knowing as I do, that nothing is to be done in Parliament 
that is not a measure adopted by ministry and supported by 
their strength, much less any thing they are averse to or 
indifferent about. 
</p><p>
I took the opportunity of discoursing with his Lordship 
concerning our particular affair of the change of government, 
gave him a detail of all proceedings hitherto, the delays it 
had met with, and its present situation. He was pleased to 
say he would inquire into the matter, and would talk with 
me farther upon it. He expressed great satisfaction in the 
good disposition that he said appeared now to be general in 
America, with regard to government here, according to the 
latest advices : and informed me that he had by his Majesty's 
order wrote the most healing letters to the several governors, 
which if shown to the Assemblies, as he supposed they would 
be, could not but confirm that good disposition. As to the 
permission we want to bring wine, fruit, and oil directly 
from Spain and Portugal, and to carry iron direct to foreign 
markets, 'tis agreed on all hands that this is an unfavourable 
time to move in those matters ; G[eorge] Grenville and those 
in the opposition, on every hint of the kind, making a great 
noise about the Act of Navigation, that palladium of England as they call it, to be given up to rebellious America, &c. 
&c., so that the ministry would not venture to propose it, if 
they approved. I am to wait on the secretary again next Wednesday, and shall write you farther what passes, that is 
material. 
</p><p>
The Parliament have of late been acting an egregious farce r 
calling before them the mayor and aldermen of <a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a>, 
for proposing a sum to be paid by their old members on being rechosen at the next election; and sundry printers and 
brokers, for advertising and dealing in boroughs, &c. The 
<a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a> people were sent to Newgate, and discharged, after 
some days, on humble petition, and receiving the Speaker's 
reprimand upon their knees. The House could scarcely 
keep countenances, knowing as they all do, that the practice 
is general. People say, they mean nothing more than to 
beat down the price by a little discouragement of borough 
jobbing, now that their own elections are all coming on. The 
price indeed is grown exorbitant, no less than jour thousand 
pounds for a member. 
</p><p>
Mr. Beckford has brought in a bill for preventing bribery 
and corruption in elections, wherein was a clause to oblige 
every member to swear, on their admission into the House, 
that he had not directly or indirectly given any bribe to any 
elector, &c. ; but this was so universally exclaimed against, 
as answering no end but perjuring the members, that he has 
been obliged to withdraw that clause. It was indeed a cruel 
contrivance of his, worse than the gunpowder plot ; for that 
was only to blow the Parliament up to heaven, this to sink 
them all down to . Mr. Thurlow opposed his bill by a 
long speech. Beckford, in reply, gave a dry hit to the House, 
that is repeated everywhere. "The honourable gentleman," 
says he, "in his learned discourse, gave us first one definition 
of corruption, then he gave us another definition of corruption, 
and I think he was about to give us a third. Pray does that 
gentleman imagine there is any member of this House that 
does not KNOW what corruption is?" which occasioned only 
a roar of laughter, for they are so hardened in the practice, 
that they are very little ashamed of it. This between ourselves. I am with sincerest esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.
