Sir, 
</p><p>
In your obliging answer to my letter of February last, 
mention is made of a work of your brother, then in the 
press, viz. " Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department." The subject and the author naturally excited my 
attention, and my desire to procure a copy. 
</p><p>
I have not learned that it has yet been published, nor 
seen any thing relative to it in our public papers. I presume, therefore, that the work is still in the press. If it is 
printing by subscription. I wish that my name may be on 
the list of subscribers, and that I may use my endeavours to 
increase the number of them. Be pleased, therefore, to 
inform me on this head. 
</p><p>
The outrages committed at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> excited the greater 
indignation, on account of the characters of some of the sufferers, and particularly your brother, whose claims to public 
gratitude have so long and so justly been acknowledged 
throughout the United States. Let me request the favour 
of you to assure him that I rejoice in the prospect of his 
recovery ; and in the hope that on the occurrence of proper 
occasions, our country will again derive advantage and 
honour from his talents and patriotism. 
</p><p>
With sentiments of esteem and regard, I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
