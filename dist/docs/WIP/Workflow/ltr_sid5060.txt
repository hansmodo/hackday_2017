Sir, 
</p><p>
I was this day surprised to hear, that in a memorial you had presented to Congress, you had said that the suits of 
clothes furnished by Messrs Sabbatier and Desprez, ought not to cost (or did not cost) more than 32 or 34 livres 
each, delivered in the ports of France. Permit me to remind you, that these clothes were transported from Paris, 
and the other places where they were made up, to the sea ports, at the expense of the commissioners ; that they cost 
something more than 34 livres, exclusive of the transportation, as I am positive the accounts themselves will show. 
I must therefore presume, if my information is right, that you may be under some mistake as to this matter, and 
therefore pray you, if you have the copies of these accounts, that you will turn to them, which must convince you of it, 
or the error is with me, for, as I recollect, these suits of clothes cost, when delivered on board, nearest 36 livres on 
an average, and those purchased from Mons. Monthieu, a trifle more, and those from M. Coder, which were of a different fashion, considerably more ; this occasioned my 
saying generally, in my narrative to Congress, that the suits cost 32s. or 33s. sterling, of which difference in our 
accounts advantage has been taken against me, though I spoke generally, referring to the accounts and contracts 
themselves to correct me if I erred. You will therefore oblige me by explaining the above, if you have the account, or if you recollect the circumstances of that transaction. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with much respect,
