Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since the date of my last to you, which was the 6th September last, I have been honoured with yours of the 10th 
and 26th June, and 19th and 29th July, with the papers 
mentioned to be enclosed. They are now before Congress, 
and I am persuaded that the strong marks they bear of 
industry and attention will give them pleasure. 
I perfectly concur with you in sentiment respecting what 
ought to be the conduct and policy of the United States, 
and I am not without hopes that they will gradually perceive and pursue their true interests. There certainly is 
much temper as well as talents in Congress ; and although 
it is not in their power to do all that should be done, yet 
they are willing and industrious to do whatever depends 
upon them. 
</p><p>
Your letters, I am sure, are useful. They disseminate 
and enforce those federal ideas which cannot be too forcibly inculcated, or too strongly impressed. Our federal government is incompetent to its objects ; and as it is the interest of our country, so it is the duty of her leading characters to co-operate in measures for enlarging and invigorating it. The rage for separations and new States is mischievous ; it will, unless checked, scatter our resources, and 
in every view enfeeble the Union. Your testimony against 
such licentious, anarchical proceedings would, I am persuaded, have great weight. 
</p><p>
Your letters, as yet, are silent respecting the evacuation 
of our frontier posts. I do not mean to press you either to 
do or say any thing unseasonably about it ; for there are 
times and tides in human affairs to be watched and observed. 
I know vour attention, and therefore rest satisfied that we 
shall hear from you on this interesting subject as soon as 
you ought to write about it. During the ensuing sessions 
of the Legislatures, I shall watch their acts, and endeavour 
to send you such as may respect the interests of the Union. 
I find it extremely difficult to collect them. When I first 
came into this office, I wrote a circular letter to the governors, requesting them, among other things, to send me, 
from time to time, printed copies of their acts ; but, whatever may have been the cause, it has so happened that, 
except in two or three instances, this request has been 
entirelv neglected. 
</p><p>
With the newspapers herewith sent, you will find the requisition of Congress. What its success will be cannot yet be determined. 
</p><p>
Tim Algerines, it seems, have declared war against us. 
If we act properly, I shall not be wry sorry for it. In my 
opinion, it may lay the foundation for a navy, and tend to 
draw ns more closely into a federal system. Onthatground 
only we wain strength; and could our people be brought 
to see it in that light, ami act accordingly, we should have 
little reason to apprehend danger from any quarter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> is happy at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Both parties are 
assiduous in their attentions to him, and it is thought more 
than probable that he will succeed Mr. Dickinson. I fear, 
in the language of our farmers, that a day so remarkably 
fine for the season may prove a weather-breeder : that is, 
that he will find it difficult to manage both parties; for if 
he gives himself up to one, he must expect hostility from the 
other. I wish he may be able to reconcile them, and thereby 
restore that State to the degree of strength and respectability which, from its population, fertility, and commerce, it 
ought to possess. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem and regard, 
I am, dear sir, 
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
