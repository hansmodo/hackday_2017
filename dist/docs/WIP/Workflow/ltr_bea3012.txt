Camp, before <a href='/results.php?city=quebec city' rel='city origin'>Quebec</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="14">14</a> <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775" rel="origin">1775</a>. 
SIR, 
</p><p>
The unjust, cruel, and tyrannical acts of a venal British Parliament, tending to enslave the American Colonies, have obliged 
them to appeal to God and the sword for redress. That Being, 
in whose hands are all human events, has hitherto smiled on their virtuous efforts. And, as every artifice has been used to 
make the innocent Canadians instruments of their cruelty, by instigating them against the Colonies, and oppressing them on their 
refusing to enforce every oppressive mandate, the American congress, induced by motives of humanity, have, at their request, 
sent <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> into Canada for their relief. To cooperate with him, I am ordered by his Excellency, General Washing ton, to take possession of the town of Quebec. 
</p><p>
I do, therefore, in the name of the United Colonies, demand 
immediate surrender of the town, fortifications, &c., of Quebec, 
to the forces of the United Colonies under my command ; forbid 
ding you to injure any of the inhabitants of the town in their 
persons or property, as you will answer the same at your peril. 
On surrendering the town, the property of every individual shall 
be secured to him ; but if I am obliged to carry the town by 
storm, you may expect every severity practised on such occasions ; 
and the merchants, who may now save their property, will probably be involved in the general ruin. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>.
