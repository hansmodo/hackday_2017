DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor of writing to your Excellency yesterday, by Jones, to which I beg leave to refer. 
</p><p>
This morning, upon inquiry, I was confirmed in my 
belief that the former Camp Committee had made no 
application to Congress for gold or silver, to be deposited in your Excellency's hands for public uses; 
wherefore, I suggested to two or three members the necessity and utility of establishing such a fund, and 
prevailed upon one of the gentlemen to move the 
House for that purpose. The motion was accepted, 
and, without a pause, the sum of five hundred guineas 
voted. These I shall presently receive, and, if possible, convey them to your Excellency under the protection of Captain Josiah Stoddard, of the light dragoons. 
</p><p>
I have just received new addresses to Congress 
from the British Commissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Governor Johnstone, in graceless and almost scurrilous terms, without exonerating himself from the charges 
alleged against him, submits to the decree of inter 
diction, lately pronounced by Congress.* Nor do the 
gentlemen, late his coadjutors, so highly resent the 
proceedings on our part, as to refuse to treat with 
out the support of the Governor's name. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will judge best from their respective performances on the present occasion ; copies of 
which shall- accompany this letter. 
</p><p>
I take the liberty of inclosing, with the present 
despatches, a letter directed " To Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel=''>Colonel Laurens</a>," under a flying seal, and to request your Excellency to peruse a paragraph contained in it, 
which speaks of a Monsieur Gal van. 
</p><p>
Monsieur Gerard is exceedingly affected by the late 
determinations on the water, near Rhode Island, and 
has communicated his sentiments to me with great 
candor. Good accounts from <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel=''>General Sullivan</a> will do more towards recovering him from a slight intermittent, which really seized that gentleman, immediately 
after he had received Monsieur Chouin's letter, than 
four ouns of bark. Indeed, I never saw people in 
general more anxious than my acquaintance, under 
the present suspense. Within the next two hours, I 
make no doubt, there will be fifty inquirers for news 
within this door. I remain, with the utmost regard, 
dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obliged and humble servant, 
</p><p>
