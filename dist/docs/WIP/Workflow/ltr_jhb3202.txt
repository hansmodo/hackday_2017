SIR, 
</p><p>
Major-General Riedesel has requested me to transmit the in 
closed to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, whom the fortune of war put 
into the hands of your troops at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
</p><p>
Having never failed in my attentions towards prisoners, I can 
not entertain a doubt of your taking this opportunity to show mea return of civility ; and that you will permit the baggage and 
servants of such officers, your prisoners, as desire it, to pass to 
them unmolested. 
</p><p>
It is with great concern I find myself obliged to add to this 
application, a complaint of the bad treatment the Provincial soldiers in the king's service received after the affair at <a href='/results.php?city=bennington' rel='city'>Bennington</a>. 
I have reports, upon oath, that some were refused quarter, after 
having asked it. I am willing to believe that this was against 
the order and inclination of your officers ; but it is my part to 
require an explanation, and to warn you of the horrors of a retaliation, if such a practice is not, in the strongest manner, discountenanced and reprehended. 
</p><p>
Duty and principle, Sir, make me a public enemy to the Americans who have taken arms ; but I seek to be a generous one ; 
nor have I the shadow of resentment against any individual, who does not induce it by acts derogatory to those maxims upon 
which all men of honor think alike. 
</p><p>
Persuaded that a gentleman of the station to whom this letter is addressed, will not be comprised in the exception I have made, 
</p><p>
I am, personally, Sir, &c., 
</p><p>
