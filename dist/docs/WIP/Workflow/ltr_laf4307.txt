My dear General, 
</p><p>
This letter has been requested of me as an introduction for M. Andre Michaux, whom, for many reasons, I am happy to present. In the first place I 
know you will he glad to know a man whose genius has raised him among the scientific people, and who, as a botanist, has, at his own expense, travelled 
through countries very little known. lie now is sent by the King to America, in order to know the trees, the seeds, and every kind of natural production, 
whose growth may be either curious or useful; and for them the king will set up a nursery at a country seat of his, which he is very fond of. I am the 
more pleased with the plan, as it opens a new channel of intercourse and mutual good offices between the two nations. I beg, my dear General, you will 
patronize this gentleman, and I much want it to be said in France, that he has been satisfied with his reception in America. 
</p><p>
I have been visiting the Prussian army, and now am in the Austrian capital. I had, but an hour ago, a long conversation with the Emperor upon the 
United States, and the American trade, in which I took care properly to answer his questions. Everywhere I enjoy the unspeakable pleasure to hear my 
beloved General spoken of with that respect he so well deserves. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear General. My best respects wait 
on Mrs. Washington. Remember me to the young 
ones. Most respectfully and affectionately, yours, 
</p><p>
