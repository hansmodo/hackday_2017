My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I will thank you to take charge of a little matter which may become important unless wisely managed. The Bank 
has just made a settlement, mutually advantageous to both parties, with the Gov't  To you, who know all the bearings 
of such a measure, I need not say, that I regard it as the termination of the war, &amp; therefore of great benefit alike to the 
Bank,and to the country. But if it be a matter of advantage to the Bank, or of triumph to its friends, like all triumphs it should 
be enjoyed with moderation. In noticing it therefore, by the press, I would specially avoid everything like exultation 
everything like rep roach to the administration as being forced, at last, to resort to the Bank. But on the contrary the administration should be treated as having done a good thing, and should have credit for a pacification which cannot fail to 
be useful to the country. It may be of some consequence to the Adm'n . to see that they do not expose themselves, by this 
step, to sneers and sarcasms from their political opponents.

Will you have the goodness to suggest this as the proper tone to be adopted by our friends in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ?
