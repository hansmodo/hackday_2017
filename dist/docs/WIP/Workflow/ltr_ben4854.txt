SIR, 
</p><p>
I received yours of May 16 with the Box of Books, and 
have already delivered and forwarded most of them as directed. I supply'd D r Fothergill with the wanting Sheet. 
I approve much of the Letter's being in English. I forwarded 
your Letter to Mr. White, Son of Taylor White, Esq r late 
Treasurer of the Foundling Hospital (now deceased) but he 
has not call'd for the Book. I am glad to hear of your Success 
at South Carolina, and that the College flourishes. I send 
enclosed a Pamphlet on a new Discovery that makes some 
Noise here. With my best Wishes of Prosperity to the 
Society and Thanks for the Number of Books they have 
sent me, which I shall endeavour to dispose of to their 
Credit, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obed' hum  Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
