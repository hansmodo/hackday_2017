Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Procter has just arrived in this city by 
the way of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>. He was unable to go forward 
to the western Indians without an escort of the Six 
Nations. He would have obtained such an escort, 
after counselling with them at Buffalo Creek, from 
the 23d of April until the 15th of May ; but the 
Indians could not proceed either in canoes along the 
Lake, or by land, but required a vessel. He applied 
to Colonel Gordon, Commanding Officer at Niagara, 
for a vessel, either public or private, for which he 
would pay ; but he could not obtain one. The design, 
therefore, of inviting the hostile Indians to peace, 
previously to striking them, has been frustrated. 
</p><p>
Brant, with thirty warriors, having Girty and McKee with him, set out from Grand River to the western Indians about the 11th of May. The Senecas 
say, his design is peace ; that he will return in June 
to the treaty at the Painted Post, and the others go 
forward to oblige the western Indians to peace. 
</p><p>
The Cornplanter continues his attachment to the 
United States; but he is exceedingly suspected by 
Brant's people, who are in an opposite interest. The 
Six Nations are for peace. Colonel Procter transmitted from <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> a full account of his proceedings 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a>. He will, therefore, be no longer 
in cloubt about pushing forward the Kentucky expedition. Colonel Procter has not made a written report yet, but he will do it soon, I have thought it 
proper to submit the substance of his mission to you. 
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
