My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
My last was from London of the twenty- eighth of June. The 
latest I have received from you is of the third of May. You 
will have heard, through various channels, of the King's escape 
from the Tuileries. By the bye, he was said to be in perfect 
liberty there ; but yet our good friend Lafayette was very near 
being hanged because he got away, and his justification tends 
to show, that his Majesty, besides his parole given, was so closely watched that he had but little chance of getting off unobserved. 
</p><p>
This step was a very foolish one. Public affairs were in 
such a situation, that, if he had been quiet, he would have soon 
been master, because the anarchy, which prevails, would have 
shown the necessity of conferring more authority, and because 
it is not possible so to balance a single Assembly against a Prince, 
but that one must prove too heavy for the other, or too light for 
the business. 
</p><p>
The Assembly also, very strongly suspected of corrupt practices, was falling fast in the public estimation. His departure 
changed everything ; and now the general wish seems to be for 
a republic, which is quite in the natural order of things. Yesterday the Assembly decreed, that the King, being inviolable, 
could not be involved in the accusations to be made against 
those concerned in his evasion. This has excited much heat 
against them. The people are now assembling on the occasion, 
and the militia (many of them opposed to the King) are out. 
As I lodge near the Tuileries, it is far from improbable, that 
I shall have a battle under my windows. The vanguard of the 
populace is to be formed by two or three thousand women. 
A good smart action would, I think, be useful rather than pernicious. 
</p><p>
But the great evil arises from a cause not easily re 
moved. It will, I think, be scarcely possible to confer authority on, or in other words to obtain obedience for, a man, who 
has entirely forfeited the public opinion ; and, if they lay him 
aside, I do not see how they are to manage a regency. His 
brothers are abroad, and so is the Prince of Conde. The 
Duke of Orleans is loaded with universal contempt ; and if they 
should name a council of regency, they would be obliged to 
take either feeble or suspected characters. Add to this the 
struggle, which must arise in a state where there is a King de 
throned, and that for trivial causes. At the same time, the state 
of their finances is detestable, and growing worse everyday. 
They have passed a law against emigrations, although by their 
bill of rights, every man has a right to go where he pleases. 
But this, you know, is the usual fate of bills of rights. How 
long the restrictions may continue is uncertain. I am, &c.
