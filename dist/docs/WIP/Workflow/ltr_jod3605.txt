MY DEAREST FRIEND. 
</p><p>
THE Senate are now in possession of the budget. It 
is a bone to gnaw for the aristocrats as well as the 
democrats, and while I am employed in attending the 
digestion of it, I send you enclosed an amusement 
which resembles it only in name. I can form no 
judgment when the process will be over. We must 
wait with patience.

I dined yesterday, in the family way, with the 
President. He told me that the American minister 
at the <a href='/results.php?city=hague' rel='city'>Hague</a> had been very regular and intelligent in 
his correspondence. The whole family made the 
usual inquiries concerning you and sent you the usual 
compliments.

Be very careful, my dearest friend, of what you 
say, in that circle and city. The times are perilous.
