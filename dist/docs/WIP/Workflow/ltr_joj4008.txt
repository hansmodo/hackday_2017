Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your very friendly letter of the 6th ult. was this moment 
delivered. I am happy to find your firmness unimpaired, 
and your attachment to your country unabated by its ingratitude. Justice will yet take place, and I do not despair 
of seeing the time when it will be confessed that the foundation of our success in the northern department, was laid by 
the present commander's predecessor. I am nevertheless 
anxious that such authentic evidence of the propriety of 
your conduct, should be transmitted to posterity as may 
contradict the many lies which will be told them by writers 
under impressions and under an influence unfriendly to 
your reputation. This subject merits attention. Facts, 
and not a single resolution of Congress, will in my opinion 
be effectual to do the business. I have thought much of 
this matter, but more of this when we meet. 
</p><p>
Your offer of a farm, &c, is very obliging : be pleased 
to accept my thanks for it. I am at present at a loss how 
to determine. Let not my delay, however, be injurious to 
you. This place, at which all the family now reside, is by 
no means agreeable or convenient, if secure, which is also 
doubtful. I purpose doing myself the pleasure of seeing 
you this winter, and shall then avail myself of your advice. 
</p><p>
The rapidity with which the desolation of your seat at 
<a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> is repairing, does not surprise me. I remember 
the despatch with which the preparations for our first expedition into Canada were completed. I wish the repair of 
our forts, &c., in the river was in the same train. 
</p><p>
As to your loss of influence among a certain body, it is 
less so than you may imagine. The virtuous and sensible 
still retain their former sentiments. The residue ever will 
be directed by accident and circumstances. Few possess 
honesty or spirit enough openly to defend unpopular merit, 
and by their c permit calumny to gain strength, 
</p><p>
These, however, are temporary evils, and you do well to 
despise them. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear sir, very sincerely, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
