Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your Excellency's favor of the l.'jth instant. I have no doubt but the reasons which induce you to decline the removal of the squadron under your command to the Chesapeake at this 
time are founded in propriety ; but I am certain, that, 
could the measure have taken place, it would have 
been attended with most valuable consequences, more 
especially as, from reports and appearances, the enemy are about to bring part of their troops from Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Although the detachments from 
your fleet under the command of the Baron d'Angely 
did not succeed at Huntington, we are not the less 
obliged to your Excellency for directing the attempt 
to be made. If that post is maintained, I think an 
opportunity of striking it to advantage may still be 
found, and I doubt not but you will readily embrace 
it. I have the honor to be, &,c.
