Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's letter of September 
12th, about the latter end of October; and should 
ere now have transmitted to you an account of the 
several matters which you desired to know, if I could 
have obtained an authentic one ; but I have never 
been able to procure such information, even of the 
enemy's force and posts, as I conceived to be so, till 
lately. That, I communicated to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, 
who, I doubt not, made you acquainted with it. Inclosed is a state of their strength and posts at present, and an answer to the several questions proposed 
by your letter. 
</p><p>
I presume your Excellency will receive from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>, by this opportunity, a return of the troops 
under his command. It is therefore unnecessary for 
me to say any thing on that head. But I cannot 
avoid lamenting that they are so few, and that I do 
not see the probability of their being soon much increased. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that circumstances have not admitted 
of your detaching, to the southward, any force from 
the main army, or from the troops of his most Christian Majesty; and I fear that the effects of the enemy's possessing the two southernmost States much 
longer, will be altogether ruinous to many individuals 
(some of whom are already reduced to the greatest 
misery and distress), and injurious to the common 
cause. Several, "whose characters were much respected, have declared themselves British subjects ; many 
others will soon follow their example, unless we 
speedily receive considerable aid. The unfortunate 
affair near Camden ; the want of support ever since 
(for there has not been a Continental soldier in the 
State since that defeat, till within these three days); 
the little prospect of any; and the representation 
made by the enemy, of the inability or unwilliness 
of the other States to send any powerful aid, â€” have 
chagrined, and made unfavorable impressions on many, 
who were formerly our good friends. 
</p><p>
Some of the stanch inhabitants of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> have 
been lately sent to St. Augustine, and others are to 
follow. The enemy have hanged many people, who, 
from fear, or the impracticability of removing, had 
received protections or given paroles, and, from attachment to, had afterwards taken part with us. 
They have burnt a great number of houses, and turned many women, formerly of good fortune, with their 
children (whom their husbands or parents, from an unwillingness to join the enemy, had left), almost naked, 
into the woods. In short, they seem determined to 
break the spirit of every man, if they can, or to ruin 
him. Their cruelties, and the distresses of the people 
are indeed beyond description. I entreat your Excellency, therefore, seriously to consider the unhappy 
state of South Carolina and Georgia ; and I rely on 
your humanity and on your knowledge of their importance to the Union, for such speedy and effectual 
support, as may compel the enemy to evacuate every 
part of these countries. 
</p><p>
I have pressed the Governor, and several members of the Legislature of North Carolina, to raise its 
complement of Continental troops, according to the 
last requisition of Congress and the present arrangement of the army; and I am certain that Virginia 
and North Carolina mighty with proper exertions, soon 
bring five thousand such troops into the field. But 
I fear that North Carolina will persevere in her old 
plan of drafting militia for that service, and am persuaded that no other recommendation or influence 
than yours, will prevail on Virginia to relinquish the 
same system, and to raise a respectable number of 
troops for the war. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
