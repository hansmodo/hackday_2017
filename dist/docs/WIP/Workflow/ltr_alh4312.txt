Sir, 
</p><p>
I have carefully reflected on the application of Mr. Ternant, for an additional supply of money for the 
use of the Colony of St. Domingo, on account of the 
debt due to France, which I regard more and more 
as presenting a subject extremely delicate and embarrassing. Two questions arise; first, as to the ability of the United States to furnish the money, which 
is stated at about three hundred and twenty-six thousand dollars, in addition to the sum remaining of the 
four hundred thousand dollars some time since promised; secondly, as to the propriety of doing it, on 
political considerations. 
</p><p>
With regard to ability, I feel little doubt that it 
will be in the power of the Treasury to furnish the 
sum. Yet, circumstanced as we are, with the possibility of more extensive demands than at present exist, 
for exigencies of a very serious nature, I think it 
would not be desirable to be bound by a positive 
stipulation for the entire amount. 
</p><p>
With regard to the propriety of the measure on 
political considerations, more serious difficulties occur. 
The late suspension of the King, which is officially 
communicated, and the subsequent abolition of royalty 
by the Convention, which the newspapers announce 
with every appearance of authenticity, essentially 
change, for the moment, the condition of France. 
</p><p>
If a restoration of the King should take place, I 
am of opinion that no payment, which might be made 
in the interval, would be deemed regular or obligatory. The admission of it to our credit would consequently be considered as matter of discretion, according to the opinion entertained of its merit and utility. 
A payment to the newly constituted power, as a reimbursement in course, or in any manner which 
would subject it to be used in support of the change, 
would doubtless be rejected. 
</p><p>
An advance, however, to supply the urgent necessities of a part of the French empire, struggling under the misfortune of an insurrection, of the nature 
of that which has for some time distressed, and now 
exposes to the danger of total ruin by famine, the 
Colony of St. Domingo, is of a different complexion. 
Succours, furnished in such a situation, under due 
limitations, would be so clearly an act of humanity 
and friendship, of such evident utility to the French 
empire, that no future Government could refuse to 
allow a credit for them, without a disregard of moderation and equity. But the claim for such credit 
would not be of a nature to be regularly and of 
course valid; consequently would be liable to be disputed. 
</p><p>
The condition in which the Colony has lately placed 
itself, by espousing the last change which has been 
made in France, operates as a serious difficulty in the 
case, and may be made a ground of objection to any 
aid which may be given them. There is even a 
question, whether there be now any organ of the 
French nation, which can regularly ask the succour; 
whether the commission to Mr. Ternant be not virtually superseded. It is also an objection (in the 
view of regularity and validity) to the supply asked, 
that the decree of the National Assembly, on which 
it is founded, contemplated a negotiation between the 
Executive power in France, and our Minister there. 
The channel has not been pursued, and no substitute 
has been provided. The business wants organization, 
in every sense. 
</p><p>
From these premises I deduce, â€” that nothing can 
be done without risk to the United States ; that, therefore, as little as possible ought to be done ; that whatever may be done, should be cautiously restricted to 
the idea of preserving the Colony from destruction and famine; that, in all communications on the subject, care should be taken to put it on this footing, and 
even to avoid the explicit recognition of any regular 
authority in any person. Under these cautions and 
restrictions, but not otherwise, I beg leave to submit 
it as my opinion that succours ought to be granted, 
notwithstanding the degree of risk which will attend 
it; that they should be effected by occasional advances, without previous stipulation, and with only a 
general assurance that the United States, disposed to 
contribute by friendly offices to the preservation of 
an important portion of the French Empire, and to 
that of French citizens from the calamity of famine, 
will endeavour, from time to time, as far as circumstances will permit, to afford means of sustenance. 
</p><p>
According to a statement of M. de la Forest, the 
provisions desired to be shipped in the course of November would amount to eighty-three thousand eight 
hundred dollars, including the total supply of fish 
and oil. Towards this he computes the application 
of fifty thousand dollars out of the remainder of the 
four hundred thousand dollars heretofore promised, 
which would leave a deficiency of thirty-three thousand eight hundred dollars. This sum, or, in round 
numbers, forty thousand, can be engaged to be furnished ; and in December, if no future circumstances 
forbid, a further sum can be engaged to be supplied, 
payable at a future short period. It will be proper 
that the most precise measures should be taken to 
ascertain, from time to time, the investment of the 
moneys supplied, in purchasing and forwarding provisions from this country to the Colony in question. 
It has been heretofore understood that the balance of 
the sum, some time since stipulated, was to be furnished ; which, accordingly, has been and is doing. 
Engagements for supplies have been entered into 
upon the basis of that stipulation; and payments to 
as great, if not a greater amount, are becoming due, 
in which the citizens of the United States are materially interested. 
</p><p>
The caution, which is deemed necessary, has reference not only to the safety of the United States in 
a pecuniary respect, but to the consideration of avoiding a dangerous commitment, which may even prove 
a source of misunderstanding between this country 
and the future Government of the French nation. 
From all that is hitherto known, there is no ground 
to conclude that the governing power, by the last 
advices, will be of long duration. I have the honor 
to be, with the highest respect and truest attachment, 
Sir, &c.,
