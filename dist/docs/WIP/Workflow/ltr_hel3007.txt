DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
It has not been in my power ; with any convenience, to make an earlier acknowledgment of your Excellency's favor of the 11th. 
</p><p>
There were letters in the Commissioners packet 
only for Congress, and particular members then present in the House. One, for Mr. E. Rutledge, unsealed, and several, also unsealed, were brought, as 
being taken from the express. The utmost caution 
is necessary, in the present conjuncture of our affairs ; 
and, therefore, had any suspicious directions turned 
up, such should have passed under the eye of Con 
gress. The idea of opening other people's letters is 
exceedingly abhorrent to me ; but I think Congress 
have a power over letters equal, at least, to that 
which necessity obliges them sometimes to exercise 
over persons; but Governor Johnstone is too well 
hackneyed in the ways of men to trust his deep 
schemes within our reach. 
</p><p>
His private letter to me, by the by, is, notwithstanding all his good sense, no proof of an infallible 
judgment; I am sure it is one of his having mis 
taken his man. I take the liberty of transmitting it, 
together with my intended answer, and the letters 
from Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning, under this cover, 
for your Excellency's perusal. There are some traits 
in Mr. Oswald's, which strongly imply a determination, on the part of Great Britain, but reserved as 
the ultimatum, to submit to our independence. I am 
much inclined to believe the Commissioners now are, 
or soon will be, vested with powers for that purpose. 
Mr. Oswald is a gentleman of solid understanding 
and quick perception, of a very large, independent 
fortune, much exceeding a quarter of a million sterling ; often consulted by administration. For the 
goodness of his heart, I refer you to this particular part of his character; he is no placeman, but much esteemed by the first men of each of the political 
parties. Great reliance may be placed upon what he 
writes, or even hints. 
</p><p>
Yesterday there was an extraordinary motion on 
our floor for calling upon members to lay before 
Congress such letters as they had received from the 
Commissioners, or other persons, meaning persons in 
Great Britain, on political subjects. I could not for 
bear offering some objections. It appeared to be a 
dangerous attempt to stretch the power of Congress. 
My letters had been read by many members, and 
were at the service of every gentleman who should 
request a perusal; but I would never consent to 
have my property taken from me by an order from 
my fellow-citizens, destitute of authority for the purpose. This circumstance, and some remarks that fol 
lowed, have induced me to put Governor Johnstone's 
letter, and my intended answer, into Mr. Drayton's 
hands, who is collecting materials for displaying the 
Governor's good designs, and no doubt he will, ac 
cording to his usual tone, add pretty severe strict 
ures. Among other papers, I transmit to your Excellency copies of the Commissioners Address to Congress, and of their commission. These are to be published by order. If no mistake was made, the copy 
of the answer of Congress was sent to your Excellency yesterday, in my public letter.

The following is an extract from a letter written by Josiah Bartlett,a Delegate in Congress from New Hampshire, to Mr. "Whipple, of the 
same State, dated <a href='/results.php?city=yorktown' rel='city'>Yorktown</a>, June 20th. 
</p><p>
" I have the pleasure to inform you that every member of Congress 
was firm and steady, never to make a peace, but on the principles 
of absolute independence. I am sorry that the answer was deferred some 
I pray God to support and direct your Excellency 
in this moment of extraordinary trial ; and I am, with 
the most sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, you rmuch obliged and obedient humble servant,
