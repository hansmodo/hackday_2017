Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter that you did me the honor to write to 
me, on the 12th of June last, I did not receive until 
two days ago. I impute this to my having been 
obliged to leave the Assembly, by the ill state of my 
health, a fortnight before it was adjourned. 
</p><p>
The very great respect that I shall ever pay to 
your recommendations, would have been very sufficient to have procured my exertions in favor of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>, independent of his great public merits in our 
revolution. I have a perfect knowledge of the extraordinary effects produced by that gentleman's writings ; effects of such an important nature, as would 
render it very unworthy of these States to let him 
suffer any where ; but it would be culpable indeed, 
to permit it, under their own eye, and within their 
own limits. I had not the good fortune to be present when <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>'s business was considered in the 
House of Delegates, or, most certainly, I should have 
exerted myself in his behalf I have been told, that 
a proposition in his favor miscarried, from its being 
observed that he had shown enmity to this State, by 
having written a pamphlet injurious to our claim of 
western territory. It has ever appeared to me, that 
this pamphlet was the consequence of <a href='/results.php?tla=tmp' rel='colleague'>Mr. Paine</a>'s 
being himself imposed upon ; and that it was rather 
the fault of the place than of the man. 
</p><p>
This, however, was but a trifle, when compared 
with the great and essential services that his other 
writings have done for the United States. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
