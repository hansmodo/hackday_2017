My dear General, 
</p><p>
Nothing worthy of your notice having fallen in my 
way to communicate, since the receipt of your very 
esteemed favor of the 20th of July, I have forbore to 
trouble you with my acknowledgments therefor until 
this time ; and I can now inform that the General Assembly of this State has lately been in session for a 
few days. After passing some resolves for organizing 
the Congress under the new Constitution, and doing 
but little other business, they were adjourned to January, the time for appointing Electors. This appointment the Assembly have retained in their own power, 
thinking it more likely to be exercised with judgment and discretion by the Legislature than it would 
probably be, was it to be intrusted to the people at 
large. Our Senators are the Honorable William Johnson and Oliver Ellsworth, Esquires, two very worthy 
and respectable members. The Representatives are to 
be chosen by the people before January next, in a 
mode very similar to that by which our Assistants and 
Delegates to Congress have been wont to be elected. 
</p><p>
The circular letter for the Convention of the State 
of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, being among the letters which the 
Governor laid before the Assembly, had, of course, a 
reading among the other public communications. This 
was all that passed respecting it; for although we 
had, in our Assembly, the champion of our antics, 
with some of his principal aids, yet no one had 
hardiness enough to call up the consideration of that 
letter, or to mention one word of its subject. Thus 
passed, in silent review, that formidable communication. 
Excepting a few, very few discordant souls, whose 
inharmonious principles will never suffer them to act 
in general concert, we continue very unanimous in 
sentiment and salutary measures in this State, and 
are progressing with much cheerfulness and great 
good humor to the commencement of the new Constitution. In the choice of a President we have, I 
believe, no discordant voice ; all minds are agreed, 
and every heart exults in the pleasing prospect of 
having their wishes so nobly gratified in this first 
great appointment. 
</p><p>
I wish the States were like to be as happily unanimous in their Vice-President. For myself, since 
our minds seem so much to be turned towards Massachusetts for filling that office, and since <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> 
is so much talked of as one, if not the first, of the 
Supreme Federal Court, I could wish to hear the name of <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> more generally mentioned than 
it is for the Vice-Presidency. From a long knowledge of this gentleman, in private as well as public life, I 
am led to entertain a high veneration for his character. I view him as a gentleman of liberal sentiments, 
extensive knowledge, and enlarged mind â€” a gentleman to whose wise, firm, and determined exertions, 
during the late troubles in Massachusetts, much more 
than to the studied popularity of their present Governor, is owing the happy tranquillity which that 
State now enjoys. It would afford me much satisfaction to reflect on the aid and support, which you, 
my dear Sir, would receive from the wisdom, prudence and discretion of such a character, in the arduous situation to which you will, you must he, advanced. 
</p><p>
If my <a href='/results.php?tla=dah' rel='friend met'>Friend Humphreys</a> continues to reside with 
you. Sir (I mention this circumstance with doubt, 
because, from his long silence and reserve, many of 
his friends consider him to be dead or absconded), if 
he should prove to be still with you, may I pray 
your Excellency to be so good as to mention to 
him the kind remembrance of his old friend T., and 
whisper in his ear that, if he should find himself not 
too fat or too indolent, his friend will be much 
pleased in hearing from him, or, at least, in hearing 
of him. 
</p><p>
My dear General, your very affectionate, obliged, 
and faithful friend and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">Jonathan Trumbull</a>.
