MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON Tuesday, when I waited, as usual, on Mrs. Washington, after attending the levee, she congratulated 
me very complaisantly and affectionately on my election, and went farther and said more than I expected. 
She said it gave them great pleasure to find that the 
votes had turned in my favor, &c. I doubted whether 
their prudence would have ventured so far. I believe it sincere. Kidd, however, the steward, was very active and busy for Jefferson. This was from 
jealousy of Briesler, no doubt. He expected that 
Jefferson would have taken him, I suppose, and his 
principle was as good as McKean's. Gerry is 
steady, while so many prove as slippery as eels. 
</p><p>
Dined yesterday with Major Jackson, in company 
with <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met friend'>General Lincoln</a> who lodges there. Married to 
Miss Willing who is an agreeable woman, and comfortably provided for by an office, he lives in a neat 
and elegant taste, but I believe prudently. Mr. Ames 
and a few more made a very social set, and we en 
joyed ourselves without alloy. 
</p><p>
The most unpleasant part of the prospect before me is 
that of remaining here until June or July. I can t see 
my grass and barley grow, nor my wall rise. I have, 
however, almost forgotten my farm. It appears very 
differently to me. It seems as if I ought not to think 
about it. The river is frozen so that nothing can get 
out. Besides, flour is dearer here than at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> by 
one third. It has rained to-day like a flood, but the 
weather must be very warm, and continue so many 
days before the river can open. There is no probability of it for some time. If it opens in season, I 
shall send some grass seeds. I will not suffer the 
bushes I have cut down to grow again ; but I shall 
not attend much to my farm. My whole time and 
thoughts must be devoted to the public. 
</p><p>
I think of you and dream of you and long to be 
with you. But I suppose this must not be yet. My 
duty and love to all.
