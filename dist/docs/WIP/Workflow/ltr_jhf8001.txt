Sir : I have the honor to be in receipt of your favor of last night, in which I am directed to suspend the execution of orders, which, in my 
capacity of military commandant of this territory, I had received from Commodore Stockton, governor and commander-in-chief in California. I 
avail myself of an early hour, this morning, to make such a reply as the brief time allowed for reflection will enable me. 
</p><p>
I found Commodore Stockton in possession of the country, exercising the functions of military commandant and civil governor, as early as 
July of last year ; and shortly thereafter I received from him the commission of military commandant, the duties of which I immediately entered 
upon, and have continued to exercise to the present moment.
</p><p>
I found also, on my arrival at this place some three or four days since, Commodore Stockton still exercising the functions of civil 
and military governor, with the same apparent deference to his rank on the part of all officers, (including yourself,) as he maintained and 
required, when he assumed in July last. 
</p><p>
I learned also, in conversation with you, that on the march from <a href='/results.php?city=san diego' rel='city'>San Diego</a>, recently, to this place, you entered upon and discharged duties, 
implying an acknowledgment on your part of supremacy to Commodore Stockton. 
</p><p>
I feel, therefore, with great deference to your professional and personal character, constrained to say that, until you and Commodore Stockton 
adjust between yourselves the question of rank, where I respectfully think the difficulty belongs, 
I shall have to report and receive orders, as heretofore, from the Commodore. 
</p><p>
With considerations of high regard, 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jhf" rel="me">J. C. FREMONT</a>,

Lieutenant- Colonel U. S. Army, and Military 
</p><p>
Commandant of the Territory of California.

Brig. Gen. S. W. Kearney, U. S. Army.
