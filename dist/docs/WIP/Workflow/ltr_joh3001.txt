SIR, 
</p><p>
The Congress having this day received certain intelligence of the sailing of two north-country -built 
brigs, of no force, from England, on the 11th of 
August last, loaded with six thousand stand of arms, 
and a very large quantity of powder and other stores 
for Quebec, without convoy; and as it is of great 
importance, if possible, to intercept them, I am ordered by the Congress to give you this information, 
and to desire you immediately to apply to the Council of Massachusetts Bay for two armed vessels in 
their service, and despatch the same, with a sufficient number of people, stores, and particularly a number of oars, in order, if possible, to intercept said 
brigs and their cargoes, and secure the same for 
the use of the Continent. It is also their desire, 
that you give orders to the commanders of the vessels you send on this service, to seize and take any 
other transports, laden with ammunition, clothing, or 
other stores, for the use of the Ministerial Army or 
Navy in America, which they may meet with, and 
secure them in the most convenient places for the 
purpose above mentioned; that you give the commander or commanders such instructions as are necessary, and also proper encouragement to the marines 
and seamen that shall be sent on this enterprise ; 
that the instructions you shall give be delivered to 
the commander or commanders, sealed up, with orders 
not to open the same until out of sight of land, on 
account of secrecy. 
</p><p>
If the vessels in the service of the Massachusetts Bay can be readily obtained, you are to employ 
them, and others, if you should think more necessary, to effect the purposes aforesaid if they can 
not, you will employ such as can be soonest fitted 
out. At the same time I am directed to inform you, 
that the Rhode Island and Connecticut vessels of 
force, if possible, will be sent directly after, to the 
assistance of those you send out ; for which purpose 
I write, by order of Congress, to those governments, 
by this conveyance. 
</p><p>
For the encouragement of the men employed in 
this service, I am to inform you that the Congress 
have determined that^ on this occasion, the master, 
officers, and seamen, shall be entitled to one half of 
the value of the prizes by them taken, the wages 
they receive from their respective Colonies notwithstanding. It is farther resolved, that the ships or 
vessels of war, employed in this service, are to be 
on the Continental risk and pay during their being 
thus employed. 
</p><p>
For further intelligence I must refer you to the 
inclosed, which I have not time to copy, as I am 
ordered immediately to despatch the express. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P. S. The inclosed please to order to be delivered to the Council of Massachusetts Bay.
