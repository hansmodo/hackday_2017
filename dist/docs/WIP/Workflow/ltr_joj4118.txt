Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am this moment returned from a long conference with 
<a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. Our prospects become more and more 
promising as we advance in the business. The compensation cases are described in the answer, and the amount of 
damages will, I have reason to hope, be referred to the decision of commissioners mutually to be appointed by the two 
governments, and the money paid without delay on their 
certificates, and the business finished as speedily as may be 
possible. The question of admitting our vessels into the 
islands, under certain limitations, is under consideration, and 
will soon be decided. A treaty of commerce is on the 
carpet. All other things being agreed, the posts will be included. They contend that the article about the negroes 
does not extend to those who came in on their proclamation, to whom (being vested with the property in them by 
the rights of war) they gave freedom ; but only to those who 
were, bona fide, the property of Americans when the war 
ceased. They will, I think, insist that British debts, so far 
as injured by lawful impediments, should be repaired by 
the United States, by decision of mutual commissioners. 
These things have passed in conversation, but no commitments on either side — and not to be of any official weight 
or use whatever.

The king observed to me the other day, " Well, sir, I 
imagine you begin to see that your mission will probably be successful." — " I am happy, may it please your majesty, to find that you entertain that idea." — " Well, but 
don't you perceive that it is like to be so ?" — " There are 
some recent circumstances (the answer to my representation, &c.) which induce me to flatter myself that it will be 
so." He nodded with a smile, signifying that it was to 
those circumstances that he alluded. The conversation 
then turned to indifferent topics : this was at the drawingroom.

I have never been more unceasingly employed than I 
have been for some time past, and still am. I hope for good, 
but God only knows. The Wm. Penn sails in the morning. 
I write these few lines in haste, to let you see that the business is going on as fast as can reasonably be expected ; and 
that it is very important that peace and quiet should be 
preserved for the present. On hearing, last night, that one 
of our Indiamen had been carried into <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a>, I mentioned 
it to <a href='/results.php?tla=wig' rel='colleague met'>Lord Grenville</a>. He will write immediately by the 
packet on the subject. Indeed, I believe that they are endeavouring to restore a proper conduct towards us everyv/irre, but it will take some time before the effect can be 
visible. I write all this to you in confidence, and for your 
private satisfaction. I have not time to explain my reasons, 
but they are cogent. "I could fill some sheets with interesting communications, if I had leisure ; but other matters 
press, and must not be postponed, for " there is a tide in 
human affairs," of which every moment is precious. Whatever may be the issue, nothing in my power to ensure success shall be neglected or delayed. 
</p><p>
With sincere respect, esteem, and attachment, 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, 
Your obliged and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
