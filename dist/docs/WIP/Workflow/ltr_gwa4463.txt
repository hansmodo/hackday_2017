Dear Lund, 
</p><p>
I am very sorry to hear of your loss. I am a little sorry to hear of my own ; but that which gives me 
most concern is, that you should go on board the enemy's vessels, and furnish them with refreshments. It 
would have been a less painful circumstance to me to 
have heard, that in consequence of your non-compliance 
with their request, they had burnt my house and laid 
the plantation in ruins. You ought to have considered 
yourself as my representative, and should have reflected on the bad example of communicating with the enemy, and making a voluntary offer of refreshments to 
them with a view to prevent a conflagration. 
</p><p>
It was not in your power, I acknowledge, to prevent 
them from sending a flag on shore, and you did right to 
meet it ; but you should, in the same instant that the 
business of it was unfolded, have declared explicitly, 
that it was improper for you to yield to the request; 
after which, if they had proceeded to help themselves 
by force, you could but have submitted ; and, being 
unprovided for defence, this was to be preferred to a 
feeble opposition, which only serves as a pretext to 
bum and destroy. 
</p><p>
I am thoroughly persuaded, that you acted from your 
best judgment, and believe, that your desire to preserve my property, and rescue the buildings from impending danger, was your governing motive ; but to 
go on board their vessels, carry them refreshments, 
commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels, and 
request a favor by asking a surrender of my negroes, 
was exceedingly ill judged, and, it is to be feared, will 
be unhappy in its consequences, as it will be a precedent for others, and may become a subject of animadversion. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt of the enemy's intention to prosecute the plundering plan they have begun ; and unless 
a stop can be put to it, by the arrival of a superior naval force, I have as little doubt of its ending in the loss 
of all my negroes, and in the destruction of my houses ; but I am prepared for the event ; under the prospect of which, if you could deposit in a place of safety the 
most valuable and least bulky articles, it might be consistent with policy and prudence, and a means of preserving them hereafter. Such and so many things as 
are necessary for common and present use must be 
retained, and must run their chance through the fiery 
trial of this summer. I am sincerely yours. 
</p>
