MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I told you in my last, -that I was going to dine with 
my friend Mrs. Rogers. You must know that yesterday the whole diplomatic corps dined here ; that 
is, his Lordship the Marquis of Carmarthen, and all 
the foreign ministers, fifteen in all, and to-day the 
newspapers proclaim it. I believe they have as 
many spies here as the police of France. Upon 
these occasions, no ladies are admitted ; so I wrote 
a card and begged a dinner for myself and daughter of Mrs. Rogers, where I know I am always welcome. 
</p><p>
It is customary to send out cards of invitation ten 
days beforehand. Our cards were gone out, and, as 
good luck would have it, Captain Hay returned from 
the West Indies, and presented us with a noble turtle, weighing a hundred and fourteen pounds, which 
was dressed upon this occasion. Though it gave us 
a good deal of pain to receive so valuable a present 
from them, vet we could not refuse it without affronting them, and it certainly happened at a most 
fortunate time. On Tuesday, they and a number 
of our American friends, and some of our English 
friends, for I assure you we have a chosen few of 
that number, are to dine with us. 
</p><p>
This afternoon I have had a visit from Madame Pinto, the lady of the Portuguese minister. They 
have all visited now, and I have returned their visits ; but this is the only lady that I have seen. She 
speaks English tolerably, and appears an agreeable 
woman. She has lately returned to this country, 
from whence she has been five years absent. The 
Chevalier de Pinto has been minister here for many 
years. Some years hence it may be a pleasure to 
reside here in the character of American minister ; 
but, with the present salary and the present temper 
of the English, no one need envy the embassy. 
There would soon be fine work, if any notice was 
taken of their billingsgate and abuse ; but all their 
arrows rebound, and fall harmless to the ground. 
Amidst all their falsehoods, they have never insinuated a lisp against the private character of the 
American minister, nor in his public line charged 
him with either want of abilities, honor, or integrity. 
The whole venom has been levelled against poor 
America ; and every effort to make her appear 
ridiculous in the eyes of the nation. How would 
they exult, if they could lay hold of any circumstance, in either of our characters, to make us appear ridiculous. 
</p><p>
I received a letter to-day from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, who 
writes me that he had just received a parcel of 
English newspapers ; they " teem," says he, " with 
every horror of which nature is capable ; assassination, suicide, thefts, robberies, and, what is worse 
than thefts, murder, and robbery, the blackest slanders ! Indeed, the man must be of rock who can 
stand all this. To <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> it will be but one 
victory the more. It would illy suit me. I do not 
love difficulties. I am fond of quiet ; willing to do 
my duty ; but irritable by slander, and apt to be 
forced by it to abandon my post. I fancy," says 
he, " it must be the quantity of animal food eaten 
by the English, which renders their character unsusceptible of civilization. I suspect that it is in 
their kitchens, and not in their churches, that their 
reformation must be worked, and that missionaries 
from hence would avail more than those who should 
endeavour to tame them by precepts of religion or 
philosophy." 
</p><p>
But he adds, " What do the foolish printers of 
America mean by retailing all this stuff in our papers, as if it was not enough to be slandered by 
one's enemies, without circulating the slanders 
amongst one's friends too ? " 
</p><p>
I could tell <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> that I doubt not there 
are persons in America equally gratified with them 
as the English, and that from a spirit of envy. But 
these open attacks are nothing to the secret and subtile enemies <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> has had heretofore to encounter. In <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> he has a firm and faithful 
friend, with whom he can consult and advise ; and, 
as each of them has no object but the good of their 
country in view, they have an unlimited confidence 
in each other ; and they have only to lament v hat 
the Channel divides their more frequent intere< ; rse. 
</p><p>
You ask me whether I must tarrv out three 
years. Heaven only knows what may be the result of one. If any probability appears of accomplishing any thing, 't is likely we may tarry. I am 
sure that it will be a labor, if not of love, yet of 
much perplexity and difficulty. The immense debt, 
due from the mercantile part of America to this 
country, sours this people beyond measure, and 
greatly distresses thousands, who never were nor 
ever will be politicians, the manufacturers, 
who supplied the merchants, and depend upon them 
for remittances. Indeed, I pity their situation. At the 
same time, I think our countrymen greatly to blame 
for getting a credit, that many of them have taken 
no pains to preserve, but have thoughtlessly rioted 
upon the property of others. 
And this, among other things, makes our situation 
disagreeable, and the path very difficult for negotiation. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
A. A.
