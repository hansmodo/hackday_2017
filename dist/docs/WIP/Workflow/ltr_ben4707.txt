DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I should sooner have answered your kind letter of last year, 
but postponed it from time to time, having mislaid the print 
</p><p>
I intended to send you, which I have now found and send 
herewith. I am glad to hear of the welfare of yourself and 
your family, which I hope will long continue. My love 
to them all. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure whenever I find that my endeavours 
to serve America are acceptable to my friends there. Your 
kind notices of them are very obliging. 
</p><p>
I find here but two of our relations remaining, that bear 
the name of Franklin, viz. Thomas Franklin of Lutterworth in 
Leicestershire, a dyer, and his daughter Sally Franklin, about 
fourteen years of age, who has been with me in London about 
a year, and sends her duty to you. Thomas Franklin is the 
grandson of John Franklin, your grandfather's brother. 
There are besides still living, Eleanor Morris, an old maiden 
lady, daughter of your grandfather's sister Hannah ; and also 
Hannah Walker, granddaughter of his brother John. Mrs. 
Walker has three sons. She lives at Westbury, in Buckinghamshire, and Mrs. Morris with her. And these are the 
whole. It is thought best by my friends that I should continue here another winter. My best wishes attend you, being 
jour affectionate kinsman, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
