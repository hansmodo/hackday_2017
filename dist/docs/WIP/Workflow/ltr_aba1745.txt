DEAREST OF FRIENDS, 
</p><p>
MY habitation, how disconsolate it looks ! my table, I sit down to it, but cannot swallow my food ! O, why was I born with so much sensibility, and why, possessing it, have I so often been called to struggle with it? I wish to see you again. Were I sure you would not be gone, I could not withstand the temptation of coming to town, though my heart would suffer over again the cruel torture of separation. 
</p><p>
What a cordial to my dejected spirits were the few lines last night received ! And does your heart forebode that we shall again be happy? My hopes 
and fears rise alternately. I cannot resign more than I do, unless life itself were called for. My dear sons, I cannot think of them without a tear. Little 
do they know the feelings of a mother's heart. May they be good and useful as their father ! Then will 
they, in some measure, reward the anxiety of a mother. My tenderest love to them. Remember me 
also to Mr. Thaxter, whose civilities and kindness I shall miss. 
</p><p>
God Almighty bless and protect my dearest friend, and in his own time, restore him to the affectionate bosom of 
</p><p>
