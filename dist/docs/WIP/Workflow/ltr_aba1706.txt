I AM very impatient to receive a letter from you. 
You indulged me so much in that way in your last 
absence, that I now think I have a right to hear as 
often from you, as you have leisure and opportunity 
to write. I hear that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jod" rel="met spouse">Mr. Adams</a> wrote to his son, 
and the Speaker to his lady ; but perhaps you did 
not know of the opportunity. I suppose you have 
before this time received two letters from me, and 
will write me by the same conveyance. I judge you 
reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> last Saturday night. I cannot 
but felicitate you upon your absence a little while 
from this scene of perturbation, anxiety, and distress. 
I own I feel not a little agitated with the accounts 
I have this day received from town ; great commotions have arisen in consequence of a discovery of a 
traitorous plot of Colonel Brattle s, his advice to 
Gage, to break every commissioned officer, and to 
seize the province's and town's stock of gunpowder. This has so enraged and exasperated the people, that there is great apprehension of an immediate 
rupture. They have been all in flames ever since 
the new-fangled counsellors have taken their oaths. 
The importance, of which they consider the meeting of the Congress, and the result thereof to the 
community, withholds the arm of vengeance already 
lifted, which would most certainly fall with accumulated wrath upon Brattle, were it possible to come 
at him ; but no sooner did he discover that his 
treachery had taken air, than he fled, not only to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, but into the camp, for safety. You will, by 
Mr. Tudor, no doubt have a much more accurate 
account than I am able to give you ; but one thing I 
can inform you of, which perhaps you may not have 
heard, namely, Mr. Vinton, our Sheriff, it seems, received one of those twenty warrants, which were is 
sued by Messrs. Goldthwait and Price, which has cost 
them such bitter repentance and humble acknowledgments, and which has revealed the great secret 
of their attachment to the liberties of their country, 
and their veneration and regard for the good will of 
their countrymen. See their address to Hutchinson 
and Gage. This warrant, which was for Stoughtonham, Vinton carried and delivered to a constable 
there ; but, before he had got six miles, he was over 
taken by sixty men on horseback, who surrounded 
him, and told him, unless he returned with them and 
demanded back that warrant and committed it to the 
flames before their faces, he must take the consequences of a refusal ; and he, not thinking it best to 
endure their vengeance, returned with them, made 
his demand of the warrant, and consumed it, upon 
which they dispersed and left him to his own reflections. Since the news of the Quebec bill arrived, 
all the Church people here have hung their heads, 
and will not converse upon politics, though ever so 
much provoked by the opposite party. Before that, 
parties ran very high, and very hard words and 
threats of blows upon both sides were given out. 
They have had their town meeting here, which was 
full as usual, chose their committee for the county 
meeting, and did business without once regarding or 
fearing for the consequences.

I should be glad to know how you found the people as you travelled from town to town. I hear you 
met with great hospitality and kindness in Connecticut. Pray let me know how your health is, and 
whether you have not had exceeding hot weather. 
The drought has been very severe. My poor cows 
will certainly prefer a petition to you, setting forth 
their grievances, and informing you that they have 
been deprived of their ancient privileges, whereby 
they are become great sufferers, and desiring that 
they may be restored to them. More especially, as 
their living, by reason of the drought, is all taken 
from them, and their property which they hold 
elsewhere is decaying, they humbly pray that you 
would consider them, lest hunger should break 
through stone walls. 
</p><p>
The tenderest regard evermore awaits you from 
your most affectionate 
</p><p>
