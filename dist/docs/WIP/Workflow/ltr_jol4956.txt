My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of writing to you the day before 
yesterday, from English Town, but through some 
mistake my letter was not delivered to the express, 
altho it was written in a hurry. I recollect no circumstance in it relative to our late engagement, 
which farther inquiry and consideration do not con 
firm. From a second view of the ground, as well as 
the accounts I have since had of the enemy's strength 
and designs, it is evident to me that Mr Clinton's 
whole flying army would have fallen into our hands, 
but for a defect of abilities or good will in the commanding officer of our advanced corps. His precipitate retreat spread a baneful influence every where. 
The most sanguine hope scarcely extended farther, 
when the Commander in chief rallied his troops, than 
to an orderly retreat ; but by his intrepidity and presence of mind, a firm line of troops was formed on a 
good position, from whence he cannonaded with 
advantage, and detached light parties in front, who 
drove the enemy from the field. Gen'l Clinton arid 
Lord Cornwallis were both present at the action. 
</p><p>
The reason for not pursuing them farther with the main body of our army was, that people well acquainted with the country said that the strength of 
the ground would render it impracticable for us to injure them essentially; and that the sandy, parched soil, together with the heat of the sun, would probably 
occasion us considerable loss. From the specimen of yesterday's march we have reason to think it fortunate that we took the part we have done ; the heat of the 
weather, thirsty soil, and heavy sand, reduced us to the necessity of bringing on many of our weaker men in waggons. 
</p><p>
We are now arrived in a delightful country where we 
shall halt and refresh ourselves. Bathing in the Raritan, and the good living of the country will speedily 
refresh us. I wish, my dear father, that you could 
ride along the banks of this delightful river. Your 
zeal for the public service will not at this time 
permit it. But the inward satisfaction which you 
must feel from a patriotic discharge of your duty, is 
infinitely superior to the delights of retirement and 
ease. I admire your constant virtue, and will imitate 
your example. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>

Col. Morgan writes this day, that the rear of the enemy is a mile below Middle Town; that he has 
had a skirmish with several of their light parties, which has cost them some lives. He had only one 
man wounded. Desertions continue, and I suppose will be very considerable at the moment of embarkation. 
</p><p>
I have seen the General much embarrassed this 
day, on the subject of those who distinguished them 
selves in the battle of Monmouth. To name a few, 
and be silent with regard to many of equal-merit w'd be 
an injustice to the latter; to pass the whole over unnoticed w'd be an unpardonable slight ; indiscriminate 
praise of the whole w'd be an unfair distribution of 
rewards; and yet, when men generally conducted 
themselves so well as our officers did, this matter is 
allowable and is eligible, because least liable to give offence. 
</p><p>
The merit of restoring the day, is due to the 
General; and his conduct was such throughout the 
affair as has greatly increased my love and esteem for 
him. My three brother aids gained themselves great 
applause by their activity and bravery, while the 
three secretaries acted as military men on this occasion, and proved themselves as worthy to wield the sword as the pen. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Gen'l Steuben</a>, his aids and your son, narrowly escaped being surrounded by the British horse, early 
on the morning of the action. "We reconnoitered them rather too nearly, and L'd Cornwallis sent the 
dragoons of his guard to make us prisoners. Gen'l Clinton saw the Baron's star, and the whole pursuit 
was directed at him ; but we all escaped, the dragoons fearing an ambuscade of infantry.

We have buried Col. Moncton with the honours of war.
