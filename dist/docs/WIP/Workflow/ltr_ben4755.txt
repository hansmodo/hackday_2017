MY DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of November 5th, and the box 
directed to the King is since come to hand. I have written 
a line to our late dear friend's son, 2 (who must be best acquainted with the usual manner of transacting your affairs 
here,) to know whether he will take charge of the delivery of 
it ; if not, to request he would inform me how or to whom it is 
to be sent for the King. I expect his answer in a day or two, 
and I shall, when I see him, inquire how your pension is hereafter to be applied for and received, though I suppose he has 
written to you before this time. 
</p><p>
I hope your health continues, as mine does hitherto; but 
I wish you would now decline your long and dangerous 
peregrinations in search of new plants, and remain safe and 
quiet at home, employing your leisure hours in a work that is 
much wanted, and which no one besides is so capable of performing ; I mean the writing a Natural History of our country. I imagine it would prove profitable to you, and I am 
sure it would do you honour. My respects and best wishes 
attend Mrs. Bartram and your family. With sincere esteem 
</p><p>
I am, as ever, your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. January 28th. The box is delivered, according to 
Mr. Michael Collinson's directions, at Lord Bute's. I have 
sent over some seed of naked oats and some of Swiss barley, six rows to one ear. If you would choose to try some 
of it, call on Mrs. Franklin.
