My Lord, 
</p><p>
I was honored by your Grace's letter of the twenty-eighth 
late last evening, and take the earliest opportunity to acknowledge it. Be assured, my Lord, that I regret much the indisposition which suspended your answer, and sincerely wish that 
it may be speedily removed. 
</p><p>
I am happy to be assured by such respectable authority, that 
it has ever been the sincere and earnest wish of this country 
to fulfil her engagements with the United States in a manner 
consistent with the most scrupulous fidelity. This indeed 
has never admitted of a question in my mind, because I would 
not harbor a doubt of the national faith of Great Britain ; and 
I have the pleasure to observe to you, my Lord, that sentiments 
of this kind induced the Congress at their last session to 
reject, by a considerable majority, some regulations which 
might have appeared hostile, and proved injurious to your 
commercial interests. I am perfectly convinced from this, and 
from many other circumstances, that the United States have a 
constant determination to perform in the fullest manner every 
stipulation which they have made ; for this is not only in itself 
a moral duty peculiarly binding upon every sovereign power, 
but it is specially secured by that constitutional compact, which 
the people of America have made with each other. Since 
both parties therefore have the best dispositions, and are influ 
enced, by the purest motives, I indulge, my Lord, the hope, 
that every obstacle to a complete performance will be speedily 
removed. And in this hope, without going into an inquiry 
as to the causes of former delay, which might not perhaps 
tend towards conciliation, I must entreat of your Grace's 
goodness to be informed in what respect, and to what degree, 
you consider the final completion of those engagements, to 
which the United States were bound, as having been rendered 
impracticable ; for I must own that the idea is new to my 
conception. 
</p><p>
The candor, with which your Grace avows the intention to 
retard a fulfilment of such parts of the treaty as depend upon 
Great Britain, meets, as it merits, my utmost acknowledgment. 
I am very far from questioning the policy, nor will I presume 
to doubt the propriety, of a caution which is, I trust, unnecessary, and which might indeed be unpleasant to the feelings of 
Americans, if they could be affected with punctilious sentiments in the discussion of national interests. But it becomes 
my duty to ask of you, my Lord, the nature and extent of the 
redress expected for the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, 
upon the specific points of the treaty ; and, in the supposed 
case that this should have become impracticable, the kind and 
the measure of compensation to be required from us, as preliminary to the fulfilment of those stipulations which remain to 
be performed by you. 
</p><p>
I trust that I am mistaken in that part of your Grace's letter, which relates to a commercial treaty, because it really 
appears to me as expressive only of the wish to cultivate 
merely an amicable intercourse, founded on commercial good 
faith, and as implying some disinclination to the securing of 
that intercourse by the force of treaty. I should be very 
unhappy to convey a false interpretation of the sentiments of 
this government upon an object of such importance. This 
might be prejudicial to both countries, and therefore T shall 
indulge the expectation that, if I am wrong, your Grace will 
have the goodness to set me right. I have the honor to be, &c.
