My dear Sir 
</p><p>
When I had the pleasure of seeing you here we conversed about the benefit which might accrue to the Country 
from the union of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> &amp; their respective friends so as to ensure their triumphant election &amp; a strong 
&amp; cordial administration of public affairs I continue of the same mind I believe that the thing most desirable now 
would be the nomination of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> for Pres t &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> for Vice Pres. &amp; this rather because it would shew both in 
this country &amp; in Europe the cordial union of these two American statesmen in whom the most confidence is placed 
in Europe than because of any adaptation of <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> for that Station which is one of mere pagent. 
</p><p>
Should however this union be impracticable, the next best thing in my judgment would be that <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> should be 
wholly unconnected with <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a>s administration, should not I mean be a member of his Cabinet there is not room 
enough for two such men in so small place. In that event his proper place is the Senate where he would I have no doubt 
go &amp; where he might occupy Mr Choats place. . . .
