Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have conferred with <a href='/results.php?tla=ruk' rel='colleague met'>Mr. King</a> on the subject of your 
letter of the 3d inst. We concur in opinion that neither a 
proclamation, nor a particular charge by the court to the 
grand jury would be advisable at present. To us it appears more prudent, that this business be opened by the 
president's speech, at the ensuing session of Congress. 
Their address will manifest the sense of the House, and both 
together operate more effectually than a proclamation. 
</p><p>
No strong declarations should be made, unless there be 
ability and disposition to follow them with strong measures. 
Admitting both these requisites, it is questionable whether 
such operations at this moment would not furnish the Anties 
with materials for deceiving the uninformed part of the 
community, and in some measure render the operations of 
government odious. Let all the branches of government 
move together, and let the chiefs be committed publicly on 
one or the other side of the question. I perceive symptoms 
of the crisis you mention ; if managed with discretion and 
firmness, it will weaken its authors. If matters can pass 
on, sub silentio, until the meeting of Congress, I think all 
will be well. The public will become informed, and the 
sense of the nation become manifest. Opposition to that 
sense will be clogged with apprehensions, and strong measures, if necessary, will be approved, and be supported. 
if, in the mean time, such outrages should be committed 
as to force the attention of government to its dignity, 
nothing will remain but to obey that necessity in a way that 
will leave nothing to hazard. Success, on such occasions, 
should be certain. Whether this should be done under the 
president's personal direction, must, I think, depend on 
circumstances at the time; or in other words, on the degree of importance which those circumstances combined 
may evince. 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately,
