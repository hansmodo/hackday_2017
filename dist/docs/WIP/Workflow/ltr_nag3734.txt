Sir, 
</p><p>
I doubt not your Excellency expected to hear of 
the evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> long before this. The 
enemy are not yet gone, although now just upon the 
eve of their departure. In two days more, the town 
will be free. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 23d of September I just acknowledged in November, with a promise to give it 
a more full answer at a future day. The Minister at 
War sent me an order for incorporating and arranging the troops of the several States, agreeably to the 
resolution of Congress of the 7th of August. I have 
formed one complete regiment out of the Pennsylvania troops, and one out of the Maryland troops, and 
sent the remainder belonging to both States home. 
Few of those of the Pennsylvania line have longer to 
serve than January next ; the Maryland troops have 
most of them a longer time to serve. I have sent 
home also the Delaware troops, and shall send the 
detachment of the fourth regiment of cavalry, under 
Captain Gill, to Virginia, to join the rest of the regiment in that State. I believe, as soon as the enemyare gone, I shall send the legion to Virginia. The 
first and third regiments being incorporated, will afford sufficient protection to this country from present 
appearances. I have not fully determined how to 
dispose of the legion, nor can I, until I am better 
satisfied with respect to the force at St. Augustine, 
to which place all the Provincial corps contained in 
the inclosed list are gone. The British troops that 
were there have joined those at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
</p><p>
By one observation in your Excellency's letter, respecting offensive operations, it appears a doubt with 
you whether you have authority to order an enterprise against St. Augustine. As there is a doubt 
on the matter, I shall remain quiet until I am more 
fully instructed. But if we had orders to undertake 
it, the thing would be impracticable without a convoy to convey the provisions and stores by water, if 
not the troops also. But more of this, hereafter. As 
to an Indian expedition, I perfectly agree with your 
Excellency that there is nothing to apprehend from 
them after British influence once fails ; and by all 
I can learn, the savages are generally inclined to 
peace, except a few of the more restless and enterprising young men, who are ambitious of military 
honors. 
</p><p>
By intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, the British troops 
are going to the West Indies. The Hessians, and such 
of the Provincial corps as remain, are going to New 
York, which is not to be evacuated till spring; nor 
do I believe it will then, if the war continues. I am afraid the Southern States can produce but few 
men in the field, by any possible exertion in their 
power. South Carolina and Georgia I am sure cannot. The force that North Carolina will have in the 
field, after a few days, will not exceed seven hundred men. There is a detachment of Virginians here, 
which had better be completed from the troops levying in Virginia to a regiment, or march from here, Srud join those in the State. I shall wait your orders on the subject. 
</p><p>
Whatever disposition you intend to make with the 
troops in this department, I could wish to be made 
acquainted with it as early as possible, to be in readiness to carry your orders into execution as early 
and as fully as possible. South Carolina and Georgia 
have not more than one small battalion of troops, and 
those not of the best kind. The enemy's force at 
St. Augustine is not contemptible, which, aided by 
the savages, and the militia, now numerous from its 
being a place of resort for the Tories, may make a 
serious impression upon Georgia. The State, without 
a considerable force to protect it for some time, cannot recover from the ravages it has felt, or even 
prosecute any trade or agriculture. <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will 
be stripped, and left defenceless, until new fortifications can be raised, and cannon provided. In this 
situation, and being altogether uncertain of the enemy's future plan of operations, I hope it will not be 
thought that I have detained too many troops for the 
present. I am, with great respect and perfect esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant,
