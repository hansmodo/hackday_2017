Sir, 
</p><p>
Four persons, who are sent to me by the Captains of American vessels, a list of whose names I have the honor to send 
you herewith, have arrived here from Bourdeaux. These 
Captains represent to me that the owners of their respective 
vessels sent them here, in consequence of the decrees passed 
by the Convention in favor of American commerce, and with 
the confidence that they would be permitted to transact their 
business unmolested; that, relying on the public faith, pledged 
by these same decrees, they brought here considerable cargoes 
of grain, flour, and other provisions; that in consideration of 
the state of foreign exchange, the said cargoes have been sold 
at an immense loss ; that they have no mode of repairing this 
loss, but to take in return commodities and articles manufactured in France; that many of them have freighted their 
vessels to carry merchandize to the French colonies, for 
French merchants; that the exportation of all merchandize 
being prohibited, they will be obliged to discharge what they 
have on board, and to depart in ballast, in consequence of 
losing the considerable freight which had been stipulated. 
</p><p>
I do not pretend, Sir, to interfere in the internal concerns 
of the French Republic, and I am persuaded that the Convention has had weighty reasons for laying upon commerce the 
restrictions of which the American captains complain. The 
result will nevertheless be, that this prohibition will seriously 
aggrieve the parties interested, and will put an end to the 
commerce between France and the United States, which was 
beginning to be brisk, and promised us fortunate results. It is, 
then, from a sincere desire to see the bonds of amity between 
the two nations more closely drawn, that I beg you, Sir, to 
have the goodness to examine whether there be not some way, 
either by an exception to the law, or by especial permission, 
to let the vessels of the United States depart, with their cargoes, 
for the ports of the said States, or the French Colonies. I 
have the honor to be, &tc.
