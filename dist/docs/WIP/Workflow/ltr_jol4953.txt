My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The world looks with anxious expectation for the 
answer of Congress to the British commissioners. 
A paper was said to have been pasted up in camp, 
which contained the terms that are offered on their 
part. The general has given orders to have the 
matter immediately traced. Low artifices of this 
kind discover feeble hopes of succeeding in a more 
regular and open way. 
</p><p>
Doctor "Welford dined with us yesterday, but I had 
no opportunity of conversing with him but in a promiscuous way. He confirms our opinion of the enemy's intention to pass through the Jerseys ; says that 
they have destroyed a vast number of blankets, etc., 
that they have strengthened their cavalry by mounting 
many of their light infantry, or at least providing 
horses, on which they are to be mounted occasionally. 
By this means they will have, he thinks, 2,500 horse 
men ; that General Grant has escaped a court martial 
for his conduct on the affair of <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, 
by his powerful interest, but that he is much blamed 
</p><p>
and abused in circles of officers. The doctor contradicts the report of Gov. Johnston's having been 
mobbed. He says, on the contrary, he is more respected than either of his colleagues, being regarded 
as the only proper person to gain the confidence 
of America, and succeed in the important business 
which they have in view. 
</p><p>
Gov. Johnston, it is said, accuses Howe of having 
acted the part both of a villain and a fool ; the latter, 
in his military operations, the former in wanton and 
unauthorized destruction of private property. 1 
</p><p>
I hope the answer of Congress will arrive to-day, 
that it will be consistent with the reply already made 
to Gen'l Clinton, &c., and if possible be calculated to 
give them less hopes. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker'>Baron De Steuben</a> has received a letter from 
Mr de Beaumarchais, which informs him that war is 
rekindled between the Russians and Turks that 
the king of Prussia is in Bohemia, at the head of 
00,000 men, where he has already seized a fortified 
castle and two regiments, to show that he is deter 
mined to have satisfaction for the dismemberment of 
the electorate of Bavaria. 
</p><p>
Gen'l Reed has some very interesting gazettes, and 
a number or two of the Parliamentary Register, parts 
of which ought to be made public, without delay, 
in the course of calling for authentic papers, and 
letters relative to American transactions. The minority has made some discoveries, which if they were 
generally known here, would prove an excellent anti 
dote to the deceitful arts which the commissioners 
are now practising. A letter from Lord Howe and 
his brother, in Novem., <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> (at a time when they 
thought nothing could turn the current of success 
from them), inclosed their proclamation offering a 
general pardon to the Americans. But they remark 
to the ministry that it will be proper to make a few 
examples, and upon the whole plainly indicate their 
intention to make as many as shall be found convenient, notwithstanding their promises. 
</p><p>
You will receive by this courier an application from 
the captain of the General's guard. He has had the 
mortification of seeing himself outstripped by a vast 
number of his juniors who had no greater merit than 
himself. He has always done his duty in his station, 
and from what I saw of his behaviour at Barren Hill, 
wants only an opportunity to establish his character 
as an officer of bravery and steadiness, in action ; and 
I really think he is entitled to a majority, at least to 
a brevet for one. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear father ; we pass a most tiresome time 
of inactivity and suspense in camp. I suppose you 
sympathize with us in the latter. I omitted to inform 
you above that Doctor Welford says the people in 
town have no other than salt provisions. Even that 
is brought to them from their vessels. As Mr "W. ought to pass for a prisoner of war, I do not mention 
his name as author of any intelligence, but in confidence to you, not that I think his history will 
be kept secret, but because I would not be the occasion of discovering it. As this courier was setting 
out hastily on a case of life and death, I did not intend 
to have said any thing on the subject of a reform, but 
as he delays I will venture to oifer a few arguments 
in favour of it. Our regiments, as you well know, 
are many of them in a very weak state, and there is 
no kind of parity between them, which is the occasion 
of great trouble and confusion in encamping, march 
ing, the detail for guards and detachments, &ca. 
To remedy these inconveniences, the General has 
issued an order to each brigadier to form his brigade 
into batallions of not less than 80 files, nor more than 
111 ; by which means they will be sufiiciently equalized to admit of their being regarded as a common 
measure for the army, and to facilitate the service. 
But as this is only a temporary arrangement, the 
field officers who are appointed by seniority to the 
command of these batallious, will not pay that attention to the welfare and discipline of the men under 
their command, which they would do in the case of 
their own soldiers ; and, from an idea that there is no 
permanent relation between them, will not have that 
affection for them which the good of the service 
requires. 
</p><p>
Had we any prospect that the States would furnish 
their due quotas for completing their respective batallions, a reduction of regiments would be unnecessary ; but as you and I very well know we have no 
right to expect them to do their duty in this respect. 
</p><p>
My letter is called for, and I must abruptly bid adieu. 
</p><p>
