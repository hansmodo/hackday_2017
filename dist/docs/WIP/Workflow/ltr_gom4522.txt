My Dear Madam, 
</p><p>
I need not tell you why the enclosed paper is transmitted to you. I know not the titles of the King of Prussia. These 
should be properly placed, you know, because monarchs are very sensitive on that subject. If reports say true, his majesty 
is more likely to listen to a woman than to a man, and this is favorable ; but what would be still more advantageous, would 
be to have your letter presented by the favorite of the day. I 
am told that Madame de Guiche has lately received his adorations. If you were to plead your cause in a court of justice, 
it might be well to insist on the rights of our unfortunate friend, but as the person to whom you address yourself is both judge 
and party, the matter of right must be touched with great gentleness. 
</p><p>
Be of good courage, for sooner or later the present clouds 
will be dissipated. All human things are liable to change. 
You may remember, that I used to inculcate that maxim when 
circumstances were smiling. It was then true, and it is still 
true. But then it was unpleasant, and now it will afford consolation. Farewell, my dear Madam. It will give me sincere 
pleasure to be useful to you and yours.
