Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was dated at <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and communicated the disagreeable intelligence of the destruction 
of Schoharie, and part of Ballstown, about twelve 
miles north-east of Schenectady ; since which I have 
not been able to write to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
As I then proposed, I immediately left <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in 
order to take the necessary measures for checking 
the further incursions of the enemy. On my arrival 
at Schenectady, I was advised that the different parties of the enemy at Schoharie and Ballstown, had 
left those places ; the former moving towards the 
Mohawk River, and the latter shaping their course 
towards Sacondaga. General Van. Rensselaer, who had 
arrived at Schenectady before me, and with orders to 
act according to emergencies, on receiving this intelligence immediately moved up the river, in hopes of 
being able to gain their front ; but this proved impracticable, as their route was much shorter, and their 
troops more inured to marching. They reached the 
river at the confluence of the Schoharie Kill, about 
six miles ahead of him, and, in that fertile country, 
recommenced their devastations by burning the houses, 
and with marks of the greatest barbarity, destroying 
every thing in their way. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances I was exceedingly perplexed. The militia, under General Van Rensselaer, 
were inferior in number to that of the enemy; the 
few I had with me were too far in the rear to sustain them ; and not much could be expected from the 
militia of the country through which the enemy passed, their whole attention being engaged in the preservation of their families ; and the levies were necessarily very much dispersed at the different posts, 
to cover the frontier settlements against the incursions of small parties. General Van Rensselaer, however, continued to move on, and, being soon after 
joined by Colonel Dubois, with between three hundred and four hundred levies, and sixty of the Oneida Indians, pursued the enemy with vigor. He came 
up with them at Fox's Mills, about twenty-six miles 
from where the enemy first struck the river, about 
sunset, and attacked them. After a considerable resistance they gave way, and fled with precipitation, 
leaving behind them their baggage, provisions, and a 
brass three-pounder, with its ammunition. 
</p><p>
The night came on too soon for us to avail ourselves of all The advantages which we had reason to 
promise ourselves from this action. The enemy took 
advantage of passing the river at a ford, a little 
above the place of action, where they again collected, and renewed their march up the river with great 
celerity ; and it became necessary for our troops, who 
had marched upwards of thirty miles without halting, 
to retire from the ground to refresh themselves. The 
pursuit was, however, renewed early in the morning, 
and the enemy so closely pushed, as to prevent their 
doing any further mischief The morning after the 
action, I arrived with the militia under my immediate command, but they were so beat out with fatigue, 
having marched at least fifty miles in less than twenty-four hours, as to be unable to proceed any further. 
I therefore left them, and put myself at the head of 
the advanced troops, and continued the pursuit to 
within about fifteen miles of Oneida -, and, if we could 
possibly have procured provisions to have continued 
the pursuit a day or two longer, there is little doubt 
that we might have succeeded so far as to have scattered their main body, and made many prisoners. 
But there were no supplies but such as I was obliged 
to take from the inhabitants on our route, and these 
were inadequate, and the collection of them attended 
with delay ; nor were the pack-horses, with the small 
quantities procured in this disagreeable manner, able 
to overtake us, in so rapid a march through a perfect 
wilderness. I was therefore obliged, though reluctantly, to return, most of the troops having been near 
two days utterly destitute, and unable to proceed. 
</p><p>
Sir John, Brant, and Butler, immediately after the 
action at Fox's Mills, left their troops, and with a 
party of Indians, on horseback, struck across the 
country, and went towards Oneida, taking their wounded with them. We discovered where they joined their main body again, near the waters of the 
Susquehanna, about six miles on this side, where we 
quitted the pursuit. Brant was wounded through 
the foot. The enemy's force under Sir John, from 
the best account I have been able to collect, amounted to seven hundred and fifty picked troops, from the 
tenth and thirty-fourth British regiments, Hessian Yagers, Sir John's corps, Butler's rangers, and Brant's 
corps of Indians and Tories, and the party that appeared at Ballstown, of about two hundred, chiefly 
British; and, by some accounts, it appears they intended to form a junction at Johnstown. 
</p><p>
In the different skirmishes, a considerable number 
of the enemy were killed ; the exact amount I am 
not able to ascertain. We have taken about forty 
prisoners, recovered most of those they had taken 
from us at Schoharie and other places, with the negroes, cattle, and plunder. Our principal loss is Colonel Brown, of the Bay levies. He, by false intelligence, was led into the fire of the whole body of 
the enemy, and fell, with thirty-nine of his and the 
militia and levies of this State; and two were made 
prisoners. 
</p><p>
The accounts I formerly transmitted your Excellency, respecting the enemy to the northward, are, as 
far as I have since been able to learn, nearly true. 
The little post and garrison of Fort Ann, appears to 
me to have been surrendered through treachery or 
cowardice. Captain Chipman, commanding officer at 
Fort George, having, on the first alarm, sent out his 
whole garrison (supposing the enemy to consist of 
only about thirty Indians and Tories) except fourteen men, obtained a very honorable capitulation before he could be induced to surrender. 
The injuries we have sustained, by these different 
incursions of the enemy, will be most severely felt. 
They have destroyed, on a moderate computation, two 
hundred dwellings and one hundred and fifty thousand 
bushel's of wheat, with a proportion of other grain 
and forage. 
</p><p>
The enemy to the northward continue in the neighbourhood of Crown Point ; and the inhabitants, in consequence of their apprehension of danger, are removing from the northern parts of the State. Colonel Gansevoort, by the advice of General Ten Broeck, 
marched to cover that part of the country, and Colonel Wiessenfels has since marched to Schenectady, 
where his regiment will continue to escort a sufficient 
supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler, a very inconsiderable part of which is as yet provided; and unless 
particular attention is paid to this business, as the 
season for water transportation in the course of a 
month will be over, and it will be impossible to forward supplies by land, the post must, in the course 
of the winter, be abandoned. The levies incorporated 
into this regiment, whose times expire about the 
middle of December, were immediately to march to 
Fort Herkimer, to keep open the communication of 
Fort Schuyler with the country. This regiment, with 
the others of this State, are so exceedingly destitute 
in point of clothing, notwithstanding every attempt 
of the State to supply them, that I could have 
wished some other regiment, better provided against 
the severe climate, had been ordered to garrison on 
that post, especially as I find, from this consideration, 
and because the troops of this State conceive it an 
hardship constantly to perform that duty, it is become extremely disagreeable to them. 
</p><p>
I forgot to mention, that, when we arrived at Fort Herkimer, a letter was despatched to Major Hughs, 
commanding at Fort Schuyler, giving him an account 
of the force and route of the enemy, and of their 
boats lying at Onondaga Lake, that he might, if he 
found it consistent "with the safety of his garrison, 
send out a small party to annoy the enemy on their 
march. By his letter to Colonel Malcom, I find he 
despatched a party of sixty men for this purpose, 
with orders to use the utmost precaution against surprise, or any thing that might prevent their returning 
to the Fort. Since my return from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> a report 
prevails, that this party were ambushed by the enemy, and defeated ; but from Major Hughs's cautious 
orders, and as I have no official accounts, I do not 
credit it. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. The enemy brought with them two brass 
mortars for four-and-three-quarter shells, which they 
concealed on their route from Schoharie. From some 
discoveries, we are in hopes of finding them.
