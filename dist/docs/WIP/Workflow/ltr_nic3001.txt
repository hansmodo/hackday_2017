SIB, 
</p><p>
I am favored with your Excellency's letter of the 
26th instant. Having just before the receipt of it had 
accounts "by a private hand of the sailing of a number 
of men-of-war and transports from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, which I conjectured were designed to supply the enemy with fresh 
provisions, I immediately sent the intelligence to Block 
Island, together with a quantity of powder, ball, and 
flints, to enable them to defend their property, and give 
them assurances of further assistance if necessary. 
</p><p>
We have no account of this fleet from any part of 
our coast; so that I think it probable they were destined to the eastward. 
</p><p>
I desire your Excellency to oblige me with a return 
of the army ; and when any thing of importance occurs, 
I shall esteem an early communication of it a favor. I 
am, with great truth and regard, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
