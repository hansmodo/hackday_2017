Dear General, 
</p><p>
The inclosed this moment came to hand, which I 
beg to submit to your Excellency. This wall be forwarded at gun-firing in the morning. I detain the 
express, and wish your answer, if agreeable, by the 
return of the bearer, that Colonel Hull may have notice as early as possible. Colonel Thomas mentioned 
the matter in a letter to me yesterdays but, as it did not come from Colonel Hull, I took no notice of 
it. If the plan should be approved, it will probably 
be necessary to furnish the militia with some ammunition. As to burning the houses at Morrisania, although they are a nest for the nefarious enemy, yet, 
as many of them belong to persons friendly to our 
cause, who have been obliged to abandon their habitations, it may not only be impolitic but injurious to 
do it. However, I will advise as your Excellency 
may think fit to direct. 
</p><p>
I must confess, I do not well like the militia having so much to do in the matter. Notifying and 
collecting men from three regiments, among whom 
many disaffected persons reside, and upon the very 
line of the enemy, is very likely to give air of the 
design; and a knowledge of the design will tend to 
blow the whole. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
