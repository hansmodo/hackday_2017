MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
My last, of the 19th instant, from <a href='/results.php?city=newburyport' rel='city'>Newburyport</a>, 
advising of the embarkation of the troops, I make no doubt your Excellency received. 
</p><p>
The same day we left Newbury, and arrived safe 
in the river next morning, except a small vessel 
which ran on the rocks, but is since off without damage, and arrived safe. I found the bateaux completed, but many of them smaller than the directions 
given, and very badly built ; of course I have been obliged to order twenty more, to bring on the remainder of the provisions, which will be finished in 
three days. Many of the vessels were detained in 
the river by running aground and head winds, which 
delayed us a day or two. The 23d instant I despatched Lieutenant Steel, of Captain Smith's company, with six men, in two birch canoes, to Chaudiere 
Pond, to reconnoitre, and get all the intelligence he 
possibly could from the Indians, who I find are hunting  there. The same day I despatched Lieutenant 
Church and seven men with a surveyor and pilot, to 
take the exact courses and distances to the Dead 
River, so called, a branch of the Kennebec ; and 
yesterday, the three companies of riflemen, under the 
command of Captain Morgan, embarked with forty-five days provisions, as an advanced party to clear 
the roads over the carrying-places. <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='co-worker met'>Colonel Greene</a> 
and Major Bigelow march to-day with the second 
division of three companies. Major Meigs goes off 
to-morrow with the third division, and Colonel Enos 
the next day with the remainder. As soon as the 
whole are embarked, I propose taking a birch canoe 
and joining the advanced party. I have found it 
necessary to divide the detachment for the conveniency of passing the carrying-places, at the first of 
which there are some carriages to be procured. I 
design Chaudiere Pond as a general rendezvous, and 
from thence to march in a body. 
</p><p>
Inclosed is a letter to Mr. Coburn, from the party 
I sent to Quebec, by which your Excellency will see 
all the intelligence I have received. I have conversed with the party, who saw only one Indian, one 
Natanis, a native of Norridgewock, a noted villain; 
and very little credit, I am told, is to be given to 
his information. 
The Indians with Higgins set out by land, and 
are not yet arrived. I have engaged a number of 
good pilots, and believe, by the best information I can 
procure, we shall be able to perform the march in 
twenty days \ the distance about one hundred and 
eighty miles. 
</p><p>
I intended <a href='/results.php?tla=chg' rel='co-worker met'>Colonel Greene</a> should have gone on 
with the first division of one company of riflemen,, 
and two companies of musketeers. This was objected to by the Captains of the rifle companies, who 
insist on being commanded by no other persons than 
Captain Morgan and myself. This, Captain Morgan 
tells me, was your Excellency's intention but, as I 
was not acquainted with it before I came away, 
I should be very glad of particular instructions on 
that head, that I may give satisfaction to the field-officers with me. There is at present the greatest 
harmony among the officers, and no accident has 
happened except the loss of one man, supposed to 
be wilfully shot by a private, who is now taking his 
trial by a court-martial. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=thm' rel='co-worker met'>Major Mifflin</a> could not send money for the bateaux. The Commissary has been obliged to pay for 
them, with one hundred pounds I have lent him, out 
of the pay received for the month of September, 
and has been obliged to draw an order in favor of 
the bearer, Mr. John Wood, who has engaged to deliver this to your Excellency. I have promised him 
his time and expenses paid. I should be glad the 
manifestoes might be forwarded on by him, if not 
sent with the last intelligence from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='co-worker met'>General Schuyler</a>, 
to whom I intend sending one of the Indians as 
soon as they arrive. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully, your Excellency's most obedient 
</p><p>
Humble servant, 
<a href="/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the foregoing, I have received 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='co-worker'>Colonel Reed</a>, with the manifestoes; 
and the court-martial have condemned the man who 
shot the other, to be hanged, which sentence I have 
approved, but have respited him until your Excellency's pleasure in the matter is known, and design 
sending him back in one of the transports. Inclosed 
are all the papers relative to the matter, with his 
confession at the gallows before respited. 
</p><p>
The three first divisions of my detachment are gone forward ; the last goes to-morrow, when I shall join Captain Morgan as soon as possible.
