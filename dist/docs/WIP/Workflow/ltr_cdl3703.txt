I embrace the first moment after my return from 
Virginia; to comply with the request of the principal 
officers of our army in tendering you their sincere respects. I have already forwarded to your Excellency 
a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>. On my return 
here, I found letters from my Court, dated in February last. They do not announce any thing pacific on 
the part of our enemies. No progress is made in the 
mediation of the Courts of Vienna and Petersburg ; 
and the Court of London seems determined to risk 
the event of another campaign, in which they will 
employ all the strength they have left. The plan 
for the campaign was not yet finally decided ; it depending on some arrangements which were yet to be 
made with the Court of Madrid, and on some advices 
which were expected from the Antilles. It nevertheless seemed to be the intention to act vigorously for 
the assistance of the United States; and though no 
particular assurances could be given me on this head, 
yet, from what they write me, it is probable that 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, or perhaps both, will be 
the object of their efforts next campaign. 
</p><p>
I think it, however, proper to inform you that, at 
the same time they announce to me their general 
views, they observe that it is an unhappy circumstance that the American army is so weak as it is ; 
and they seem to fear that it will not be in a condition to second their efforts, when it shall be necessary to strike a decisive stroke, or to undertake operations in which such extensive means are required 
as in a siege. 
</p><p>
I beg your Excellency would enable me to give 
my Court the necessary information on a matter so 
important as this is. I am not curious to know any 
of the particular details relative to your army, which 
it may be necessary to keep secret j but the military operations of France and America are so intimately connected, that it is indispensable for us to 
know what is the actual force and means which you 
have, in order to calculate, with any degree of probability, what enterprises can be undertaken. Our 
ignorance in this respect cannot but be very prejudicial to our affairs, because if, from false information, 
we consider your army as weaker than it really is, 
it will prevent our forming plans which it would be 
possible to execute ; and if, on the contrary, we 
are led to believe it stronger than it really is, we 
run the risk of forming plans impracticable in their 
execution. It is from these considerations that I beg 
you to confide to me such information on this head 
as you may think proper, both with respect to the 
actual force you have at the different parts of the 
Continent, and what it will probably be in the course 
of the campaign. It is equally interesting to know 
the force of the enemy, both in regulars and militia. 
I beg you to rest assured of the discretion with 
which I shall make use of these communications. 
</p><p>
I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of communicating to you the sentiments with which our Court and 
the nation at large are inspired, from the reports of 
the French officers, respecting your Excellency, on 
their return to Versailles. Their testimony could 
add nothing to the universal opinion of the great 
services you have rendered your country j but to the 
esteem and admiration of the French, is now added a 
sentiment of affection and attachment, which is the 
just return for that attention our military experienced 
from you, and the progress they made in their profession by serving under your orders. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most respectful 
and inviolable attachment, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant,
