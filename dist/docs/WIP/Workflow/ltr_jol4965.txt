My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I avail myself of Col. Bannister's offer to have the pleasure of writing to you. 
</p><p>
The intelligence which we have received since my 
last, confirms the idea of a grand move on the part of 
the enemy. A British matross who deserted the day 
before yesterday declares that he assisted in embarking artillery and stores, and says that five thousand 
troops are destined for the "West Indies. Accounts received some days since of taylors being employed in 
stripping regimental coats of their lining and making 
up thin overalls and waistcoats, indicates an expedition to a warmer climate than any on the territories 
of the United States, in the approaching season. 
It is reported that many merchants are disposing of 
their wares by vendue at low rates. I am not acquainted with the persons to whom we are indebted 
for intelligence, and therefore cannot be sure whether 
they are the dupes of reports circulated by the enemy, 
or give us a relation of facts that may be depended on. 
</p><p>
There appears to be no other object here for the 
enemy but the French squadron, nor elsewhere but 
the French islands. Either will require an exertion 
of their whole force, and the latter perhaps will upon 
several accounts be preferred. 
</p><p>
Some people are of opinion that they will aim first 
at the ruin of the squadron, and then direct their whole force against some French island. It is difficult to predict what measures will be pursued by 
men, who have been so eccentric in their military operations. 
</p><p>
If they had been vigorous, the French squadron 
might have fallen a sacrifice, and it would have been 
a tottering stroke to the marine of France. But their 
delay and the disposition which has been made by our 
general, have, I hope, pretty well secured an object of 
such importance to the common cause. 
</p><p>
It is to be urged in excuse for them that Byron's 
fleet suffered by a storm, and that the crews belonging 
to it are in very bad health. The division of six ships 
under Rear Admiral Parker at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, has been 
obliged to land five hundred, some say a thousand 
men ; besides, you know, two of his fleet (one of them 
the Admiral's ship), arc said to be missing, and one, to 
have put back to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
The army will move from its present position to 
morrow morning. 
</p><p>
God preserve you, my dear father.

Mr. Galvan, an officer in one of our Carolina regiments brought me two letters of very particular 
recommendation from the Bn. de Holzendorff and Mr. Reid. Some of our family informed me that in 
a letter to me, which I have not yet received, this person was mentioned in such a manner as excluded him from favour. When he called upon me, therefore, I 
did not introduce him to the General ; he found means however, to introduce himself, and ask the General's protection. The Gen'l asked me in private whether 
this was not the person alluded to in your letter ; I told him he was; the General then left the room with out taking any farther notice of him. Galvan finding 
he had so little encouragement to stay, retired. Yesterday he came again and produced a letter which he said he intended to send to you, in which he desires 
that through my mediation he might be restored to your friendship, and desired leave to read it. I told him he was the master to write what he pleased, but 
that I should not confirm that in my letters to you. He asked me the reason of the cold reception the Gen'l had given him. I told him that I must frankly 
inform him that we had all heard very serious matters to his disadvantage, and besides that, as his only object here was to serve as a volunteer, he might depend 
upon it, that there was no opening for him. He asked me whether I had received any letter from you respecting him ; I told him I had not. He desired to 
have an opportunity of justifying himself before the General, but this I waived. I was then called oft for some business, and he went away saying that he would call again.
