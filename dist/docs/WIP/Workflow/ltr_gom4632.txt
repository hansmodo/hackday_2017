Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your favors of the twelfth of July, and fifteenth of October. The last reached me yesterday, by express from Bordeaux. I am astonished to find, that so late as the 
middle of October you had received but one of my letters. I 
had taken every precaution against miscarriages, but there is 
no answering for the negligence of those one is obliged to em 
ploy in the posts. 
</p><p>
When I mentioned supplies to St Domingo, I certainly 
meant that such supplies should be purchased by French 
agents in the United States, and that the money should be advanced by us in diminution of our debt, upon such terms as 
that the United States should not lose in the mode of payment, 
but the contrary, besides the advantage of expending such 
large sums in the purchase of objects, the growth, produce, and 
manufacture of our country, and of its industrious inhabitants. 
As to specific supplies, I had declared in pointed terms, that 
the American government would by no means enter into stipulations of any kind, with relation thereto. I am happy to find 
that, on this occasion, my sentiments have so fully coincided 
with yours. 
</p><p>
It gives meal so great relief to be informed, that until further 
orders the payments are suspended. You will have seen that 
on this point I have been hard run, and I do assure you that 
if fear, or interest, would have induced me to swerve from the 
line of duty, there were not wanting sufficient motives. But 
it is not needful to relate such particulars, and you may rely 
that I shall not communicate your present instruction respecting our debt, unless I shall be of opinion that it will become 
serviceable to the honor or interest of the United States. 
</p><p>
I see with concern that the Indian war is like to continue. 
This war prevents the investments of European money in the 
purchase of our waste lands, and I have already expressed to 
you my conviction, that this species of investiture would be as 
salutary, as the engrossing of our domestic debt is pernicious. 
The distressed state of things here induces many to turn their 
attention towards us, and consequently occasions numerous applications to me. I endeavor, as far as propriety will admit, to 
lead people to a preference of American lands, but I am sorry 
to observe that the disposition to invest in our funds is predominant, and that we shall thereby become tributary to those who 
obtain, below its value, a share of those funds. I think it my 
duty to mention this to you, to the end that if any measures 
can be devised to enhance the value with you, and thereby 
lessen the negotiations, or at least obtain thereon the competent value, such measures may be adopted. 
</p><p>
Although I step very much out of my sphere for the purpose, 
I feel myself bound also to mention, respecting this Indian war, 
some ideas which have formerly suggested themselves to me, 
and which the circumstances of the present moment seem to 
favor in a peculiar manner. I cannot but think, that it would 
be well to build a fleet on Lake Erie, having for that purpose 
established a strong post at Presque Isle, which is, I believe, the 
only good harbor on the south side-of that Lake, and to send 
also a Flotille from Oswego, with flour and salt provisions, to 
be transported by way of Niagara. As to this last measure, 
if not obstructed by the British, it would considerably lessen 
the expense, and if opposed, would terminate that situation of 
demi-hostility, which has but too much existed with them. If 
a body of fifteen hundred men were sent with all the needful 
stores by water, in good vessels, they might establish a strong 
post near the Miami Towns, and carry on from thence a war of 
devastation, which would force the savages to abandon the country, and that is, I believe, the only effectual means of obtaining 
peace with them. 
</p><p>
You will find enclosed herewith my letters of the twenty-seventh of September, and twenty-third of October. I have had no good opportunity since the latter of those dates. If, 
indeed, America had been at the distance of only fifty leagues, I should have given you every two or three days the state of 
men and things ; but placed as we are, both morally and physically in respect to this country, I should only have wearied 
you by the little uninteresting histories of persons and projects, 
whose existence will soon be consigned to an endless oblivion. 
It has however appeared to me important to obtain, as nearly as 
may be, a view of the greater events which may probably 
arise, because the conduct of the United States will, I presume, be squared rather to that state of things, which you may 
conceive likely to be established, than to the fluctuating chances of an hour which passes away. 
</p><p>
I shall resume, then, my account of things where I last left 
it, viz. in the projected invasion of Flanders ; and first, it may 
be proper to cast an eye on the structure and consistence of 
the French armies. The leading feature here is an artillery, 
which is, beyond all controversy, the best in Europe, and likely to continue so from two causes. First, that the Frenchman 
is by nature a better artillerist than almost any other man, it 
being in his temper, and, and if I may say so, in his blood 
and marrow to act suddenly and without deliberation. Hence 
he becomes very dexterous in those things, which are to be per 
formed at a single motion, and by a single glance, but rarely 
acquires a knowledge of any business which requires constant, 
close, and undissipaied attention. Secondly, the excellence 
of the French artillery depends upon the great care and culture of their natural disposition. The able men, who have formerly been at the head of their military affairs, had the merit 
of knowing the character they had to do with, and therefore 
(quitting what appeared unattainable in the military art) sought 
perfection there, where Frenchmen could find it. They des 
paired of forming solid columns of infantry, moving with the 
exact precision of German discipline. It happens, therefore, 
that the present French army differs less from what the French 
armies have been heretofore, than would easily have been sup 
posed. The same enthusiasm of enterprise, the same con 
tempt of danger, the same impetuosity of valor, and the same 
impatience of control, still mark the nation which inhabits the 
country that was once ancient Gaul. 
</p><p>
They have, as heretofore, overrun Flanders, made impression on Germany, and occupied Savoy. Dumouriez, in his 
Flemish expedition, combined the arts of a politician with the 
bravery of an experienced soldier. You know that the inhabitants of the Low Countries were indisposed to the domination 
of the House of Austria, particularly since the attempts of Joseph the Second to weaken the influence of the priesthood. 
During the latter part of his reign, there had sprung up three 
parties, viz. the Bigots, who wanted a kind of theocracy, to be 
exercised by the priesthood ; The Nobility and substantial 
burghers^ who wished to established a free and well organized 
constitution ; and the French party, or those who were desirous 
of levelling the nobles; and above all, the church, which possesses as you know the greatest part of the Flemish territory. 
</p><p>
On the return of imperial authority, after the revolt under 
Vandernoot and Van Eupen, the second party above mentioned, naturally enough fell in with the government, as they had 
already experienced no little tyranny from the priests, and saw 
much danger in the prevalence of French ideas. They stick 
led however, for a confirmation of ancient chartered rights, 
and the disputes on that chapter were still open. They hoped 
that the war, whose avowed object on the part of France was 
to drive out the House of Austria, would induce the Emperor 
to cede the points in controversy. The cabinet of Vienna, on 
the other hand, believing in a certain victory over the French 
government, rather wished, than feared revolt ; and when the 
face of affairs had materially changed, it was too late to retract, 
since the concession of weakness, neither conciliates affection 
nor commands respect. 
</p><p>
The agents of the different parties, who had preserved a connexion more or less direct with Dumouriez, were urgent with 
him to go into Flanders, as soon as the Prussian army began to 
retreat, and he adroitly flattered each with the hope of favoring 
its particular views. This was done at the expense of a little 
lying, which does not cost him much. By these means the 
crafty priests were as completely duped as their adversaries, 
and more so. 
</p><p>
After the battle of Jemappe when he had taken possession 
of Mons, he took care to proscribe the adherents to the Emperor, which left but two parties to deal with ; and although the ecclesiatics began to perceive their danger, it was now too late, 
and they were obliged to pretend an attachment which they 
did not feel, and which served his temporary purpose as effectually as if it had been sincere. But he had too much sense 
not to know, that measures hostile to the real interests of the 
country could only be carried into effect by those, who have 
no common interest with the country, the populace of the large 
towns, who, having some chance to gain by turning all things 
topsy turvy, and who being happily secure against the possibility of loss because they have nothing to lose, are always the 
ready instruments of mischief to those, who can bring themselves. 
to use them for destructive purposes. He, therefore, published 
a proclamation, which may in a few words be transmitted into an 
order to be free, according to his ideas of freedom, on pain of 
military execution. As a military man, he had almost insured 
success by advancing with three armies, the last of which was 
equal to all the force the enemy could muster, and the centre, 
which he commanded, was double that spread over the different parts of that level country. At the affair of Jemappe, he 
commanded eighty-six thousand men, although they were not 
all in action, because eighty thousand cannot act together on 
only two sides of eighteen thousand. By the bye, this affair, 
notwithstanding the accounts published, was decided by the 
immense train of heavy artillery which the French employed, 
and the proof is in the retreat of the Austrians, who carried off 
their cannon, a thing impossible, had the lines been taken, as 
was said, by assault ; but the truth is, that the assault was given after the retreat was begun, and the Hungarian Grenadiers, who brought up the rear, were in course cut to pieces. 
</p><p>
Dumouriez, as soon as he had got fairly in possession of 
Brussels, began to develope his particular plans. It was 
never his intention to continue, if he could avoid it, in the 
capacity of a servile agent to the Executive Council ; but they 
also were aware of his views ; hence the course of his successes naturally tended to a breach between them. There 
were additional reasons on each side, both of safety and advantage, too tedious to enumerate, because it is sufficient to state 
those sentiments which may govern events, without developing 
all the sources from which they originate. The Council gave 
orders for opening the Scheldt, with design to captivate by that 
measure, the attention of the people of Brabant, and, lessening 
his influence, increase their own. He struggled against that 
measure but in vain. Having, however, made the step, he 
formed the farther plan of attacking the Dutch, who were by 
no means prepared to receive him ; and the party in that 
country, which calls itself Patriotic, and which others would be 
very apt to term Aristocratic, immediately opened an intelligence with him. 
</p><p>
The governing powers here, in the midst of all these plans, 
(and intoxicated by success, perhaps,) declared themselves 
the allies of all those, who would revolt against established 
authority, and the enemies of all those who would not revolt. 
They determined that everybody should be free, French fash 
ion, and should pay the expense which might attend the making of them free. This last address to the purse was not, 
perhaps, well calculated for the taste either of the Hollanders 
or Flemings ; but the latter must for the present submit to 
whatever impositions may be laid on them, being in the power of this country. 
</p><p>
Shortly after the plan was laid for invading Holland, of 
which the above mentioned decree was a partial execution, 
two circumstances arose which changed the measures of the 
Council. The French army began to lessen very much ; but 
this is a subject which I must treat separately ; and therefore 
barely mention it in this place. The other circumstance was, 
that the ministers and agents they had employed in London 
assured them, that, although the declaration respecting the 
Scheldt had occasioned much alarm, and irritated at the same 
time the British cabinet, yet they might avoid hostilities, if 
they did not actually invade the Dutch territory. They, in 
consequence, gave orders to Dumouriez to abandon his design 
upon the Netherlands, and turn his arms to another quarter. 
These he refused to obey ; but being reiterated, and things here 
being a little different from what he hoped, he has within 
these few days submitted ; but I shall come to this part of the 
history presently ; and here I will conclude as to Holland, by 
adding that the agents of the patriotic party press the government hard to attack their native country immediately, but are 
told that the time is not favorable, that they will certainly 
march that way by and bye, but that at present they have not 
sufficient force nor supplies. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that <a href="/results.php?tla=leb" rel="met colleague">M. Lebrun</a> declares to the Assembly, that they are guiltless of any design against Holland, and 
that England cannot justly complain on that score. I presume, however, that the British ministry are exactly informed 
of the contrary ; but be that as it may, you may rely on what 
I relate to you. In respect to the Flemish, before I leave 
them, I must tell you that their ancient hatred to the French is 
all revived, and is, if possible, more violent than ever. Several reasons for this appear from what I have already said ; but 
there is one cause, affecting equally all the neighbors of 
France, and which it may be well in this place to mention, ft 
would seem, at first sight, somewhat strange, that the people in 
the world, the most amiable at home, should be the most disagreeable abroad ; but this is strictly true. The morals, or 
rather the want of morals, in this country, places every one at 
his ease. He may be virtuous if he pleases, but there is no 
necessity either to be, or to appear so, consequently, both good 
men, and bad men, can enjoy the society of Paris; but when 
the French go abroad, they desire to introduce among other 
people the same free and easy principles, which do by no 
means suit the taste of those, who consider a chaste and orderly deportment essential to the peace and happiness of civil society. 
</p><p>
The open contempt of religion, also, cannot but be offensive 
to all sober minded men ; add to this, a style of conversation, which runs on the insulting comparison between their own 
usages, and those of the people with whom they live. In this 
they naturally, and I believe justly, give a preference to their 
own, but this preference becomes irksome to others, especially, if, in the expression of it, there should be mingled some little contempt, which is not uncommon. The French emigrants had wearied out all those countries, which for two years 
past they have infested, and had accumulated on their own 
heads the antipathies, which had been previously extended to 
all their countrymen. Nay, from this hatred to them sprang 
up a kind of left-handed love for the Jacobins, it being natural 
to like those who war on the persons whom we dislike. But 
no sooner do the French armies enter into a country, than the 
scene changes. The emigrants do not indeed find favor, but 
the original sentiments of the people return in regard to the 
French nation. These sentiments are universally unfavorable, 
as I observed (with sorrow and surprise) in a journey I made 
two years ago through Flanders, and a part of Germany, viz. 
that which is the seat of the war. 
</p><p>
The irruption into Germany, under Custine, was attended 
with the same rapid success as that of Dumouriez, into the 
Low Countries. Mayence was surrendered, rather to the Assignats, than to the arms of France, it is believed. Frankfort 
naturally fell, as being a neutral city. Contributions were 
raised in both, and you will see with astonishment, that the 
Deputies sent from Frankfort, to solicit the remitment of her 
contribution, were made prisoners here, when their city was 
retaken by the Prussian and Hessian forces. This recapture 
was attended with strong circumstances to show that hatred of 
the French, which I have above mentioned. Custine's ad 
vance into Germany was certainly hazarded beyond the rules 
of prudence, and it will be well if he escapes with no further 
loss, than what he has already suffered. His present situation 
is certainly critical, since the Council have thought proper to 
order on Dumouriez to his relief. And here, by the way, it 
will be well to remind you, that the distance from Valenciennes to Liege is about one half the distance from Liege to 
Mayence, and that the former is a level, open country, the latter a country of defiles, at least for a considerable part of the 
distance. Add to this, the season, which is already severe in 
that quarter, and must, in all human probability, become more 
so every day, and you will easily see why Dumouriez in 
agreeing, at last, to obey his orders, has declared that he will 
by no means be responsible for the success. You will recollect, also, the diminution of the French armies, which it is 
proper now to state more particularly. 
</p><p>
The alarm spread through France after the affair of the 
tenth of August ; the call to defend their country, a call which 
must ever be efficacious so long as men are endued with the 
feelings of men ; the boiling spirit of the nation, and the 
strenuous exertions of those against whom the Duke of Brunswick had denounced an inexpiable war, had called into 
the field six hundred thousand men. Presently, France renewed the appearance of a nation of warriors, overflowing on 
every side, and bearing down with an irresistible impetuosity every obstacle. Her enemies, who had never brought against 
her, in the whole, above one hundred and fifty thousand, and who were much reduced by sickness and fatigue, found them 
selves obliged to retire, and had no resource but to impede a progress which they could not prevent. This government, on 
the other hand, sensible that the next campaign would press them hard, and feeling, in spite of delusive appearances, that 
a paper system of finance must at length sink under the enormous weight of their expenses, thought it wise to push to the 
utmost their successes, and were little solicitous about a loss of men, which they could supply more easily than their enemies. 
</p><p>
But there is, to the physical powers of man, a narrower 
bound than to his moral conceptions. Excessive fatigue, want 
of necessaries, and bad accommodations, have carried many to 
the grave. Not a few have fallen in action. At the present 
moment, there are in the different military hospitals seventy-five thousand sick beds, and at Liege their hospital stores are 
so greatly deficient, that the inhabitants have been compelled 
to furnish all their spare beds and mattrasses, notwithstanding 
which, many of the sick soldiers lie on the straw. The ex 
tent of country which they occupy, and the projected changes 
in government, contrary to the wish of the majority of the 
people, render it necessary to keep up garrisons, beyond those 
which are placed on the communications. 
</p><p>
A great proportion of the volunteers, who had turned out 
at first to defend their country, who had afterwards been 
prompted by a national spirit and temper to march into the 
neighboring states, and who, from the same spirit and temper, 
pursued as long as their limbs would support them, sinking at 
last under fatigue, have stopped, and from that moment it is 
in their nature to return, such of them at least as are able ; of 
consequence, the troops in condition to act are, comparatively 
speaking, but a handful, although still numerous. 
</p><p>
You will see by the gazettes, that the armies of France have 
frequently been straitened for subsistence, and surely this is 
not to be wondered at. Lorraine is so completely eaten up, 
that, as I am credibly informed, above one hundred thousand 
of its inhabitants had left it before the present month, for want 
of food. A contagious dysentery had swept off numbers in 
that quarter. You know the country from Aix La Chapelle 
to Coblentz, and that having been the theatre of war almost 
since the first of August, it will be impossible to find anything 
in it, and that confined by the Ardennes on one side, and the 
Rhine on the other, nothing can be brought to it but by a 
land transportation of at least fifty leagues. I fear that even, 
had Dumouriez quartered his troops as he intended in and 
about Liege, it would have been extremely difficult to have 
collected magazines, especially for his cavalry. What must it 
be, when he gets to the neighborhood of Bonn. Beurnonville 
is, you will see, pushing with an army of thirty thousand men 
towards Coblentz, by the way of Treves. A rugged country 
of fastnesses, defended by the winter, and fifteen thousand 
Austrian troops are opposed to him. Consequently his progress 
is slow, and by and bye his convoys will be exposed to parties 
from the garrison of Luxembourg. Thus you see, Sir, that 
France is warring at present against nature herself, as it were, 
and sanguine men hope for success. If it be obtained, the 
enemy will open the next campaign under manifest disadvantages. But we must not yet enter into that consideration. 
</p><p>
You will have seen that the Jacobin club is as much at war 
with the present government, as it was with the preceding. 
Victory or death, is the word with both parties. Hitherto the 
majority of the Convention have had rather the advantage, al 
though they frequently decree what they do not wish. The 
ministers, possessing vastly more patronage than any monarch 
since Louis the Fourteenth, secured by that means the influence of the majority, their friends and the Jacobins, who, 
backed by the Parisian populace, have been several times 
within an inch of ruin. Luckily for them, their adversaries 
are many of them timid, while the Jacobin leaders are daring 
and determined. 
</p><p>
It is now some time since the Jacobins despatched BonneCarrere to make overtures to Dumouriez, whose quarrel with 
the Council was then just breaking out. It was then understood, 
that if Dumouriez threw up his commission in disgust, his 
army would presently retreat back to Valenciennes ; and this 
it was supposed would justify a coup de main in this city, and 
extend the influence of it through all France, Ever since 
this embassy of Bonne-Carrere, things have been ripening fast 
on both sides. At present there is a schism in the ministry, 
and Pache, the Minister of War, throws his weight into the 
scale of opposition. Dumouriez has, I am told, acceded, 
notwithstanding the adulations and concessions of the other 
party, and the coalition now nearly balance their opponents. 
</p><p>
A late circumstance brought forward a show of forces, and 
though it is rather anticipating a different subject, I must state 
it here. The Brissotines, finding themselves hard pushed 
towards the killing of the King, and apprehensive, not without reason, that this might be a signal for their own destruction, determined on a measure not a little hazardous, but decisive. This was the expulsion of the Bourbons, a blow 
originally levelled at the Duke of Orleans. The motion was 
carried, but the Convention have been obliged to suspend the 
decree, and that is, I think, equivalent to a repeal. The sus 
pension evidently was pronounced under the influence of the 
Tribunes. Many members have talked of leaving Paris, but 
the same fear, which controls them while in this city, will pre 
vent them from quitting it. At least, such is my opinion. 
</p><p>
I come now to the trial of the King, and the circumstances 
connected with it. To a person less intimately acquainted 
than you are with the history of human affairs, it would seem 
strange that the mildest monarch who ever filled the French 
throne, one who is precipitated from it precisely because he 
would not adopt the harsh measures of his predecessors, a 
man whom none could charge with a criminal or cruel act, 
should be prosecuted as one of the most nefarious tyrants, that 
ever disgraced the annals of human nature. That he, Louis 
the Sixteenth, should be prosecuted even to death. Yet such 
is the fact. I think it highly probable that he may suffer, and 
that for the following causes. The majority of the Assembly 
found it necessary to raise, against this unhappy Prince, the 
national odium, in order to justify the dethroning him (which, 
after what he had suffered, appeared to be necessary even to 
their safety) and to induce the ready adoption of a republican 
form of Government. Being in possession of his papers, and 
those of his servants, it was easy, if they would permit them 
selves to extract, to comment, to suppress, and to mutilate, 
it was very easy to create such opinions as they might think 
proper. The rage which has been excited was terrible ; and, 
although it begins to subside, the Convention are still in great 
straits ; fearing to acquit, fearing to condemn, and yet urged 
to destroy their captive Monarch. 
</p><p>
The violent party are clamorous against him, for reasons 
which I will presently state. The Monarchic and Aristocratic 
parties wish his death, in the belief that such catastrophe would 
shock the national feelings, awaken their hereditary attachments, and turn into the channels of loyalty the impetuous 
tide of opinion. Thus, he has become the common object of 
hatred to all parties, because he has never been the decided 
patron of any one. If he is saved, it will be by the justice of 
his cause, which will have some little effect, and by the pity 
which is universally felt, though none dare express it openly, 
for the very harsh treatment which he has endured. 
</p><p>
I come now to the motives of the violent party. You will 
see that Louvet, whose pamphlet, with many others, I send 
you, has charged on this party the design to restore royalty in 
the person of the Duke of Orleans. This man's character and 
conduct give but too much room to suspect him of criminal 
intentions. In general, I doubt the public virtue of a profligate, 
and cannot help suspecting appearances put on by such per 
sons. I have besides many particular circumstances, which 
lead me to believe that he has, from the beginning, played a 
deep and doubtful game ; but I believe also, that on the present 
occasion, as on some preceding, he is the dupe. Shortly after 
the tenth of August, I had information on which you may rely, 
that the plan of Danton was to obtain the resignation of the 
King, and get himself appointed chief of a council of regency, 
composed of his creatures, during the minority of the Dauphin. This idea has never, I believe, been wholly abandoned. 
The Cordeliers, (or privy council, which directs the Jacobin 
movements,) know well the danger of intervening the order of 
succession. They know how to appreciate the fluctuating opinions of their countrymen, and though they are very willing to 
employ the Duke of Orleans in their work, I am much mistaken, if they will consent to elevate him to the throne. So that, 
for his share of the guilt, he may probably be rewarded with 
the shame of it, and the mortifying reflection that after all the 
conflicts of his political warfare, he has gained no victory but 
over his own conscience. 
</p><p>
It is worthy of remark, that, although the Convention has 
been now near four months in session, no plan of a constitution 
is yet produced. Nevertheless, the special authority commit 
ted to them by the people, and the only authority, perhaps, 
which cannot be contested, was to prepare such a plan. 
</p><p>
I shall now, Sir, make a few reflections on the state of Foreign powers. The adoption of Savoy, as an additional department, forms one ground on which the adversaries of this country contend, that their protestations against conquest were only 
delusive. But the declaration, that they would erect the standard of liberty everywhere, forms the great cause with some, 
and pretext with others, for endeavoring to crush the Republic. 
</p><p>
On" the conduct likely to be pursued by Great Britain, al 
though that of Holland stands in close connexion, I shall not 
permit myself to hazard much conjecture, because Mr Pinckney will, I am persuaded, keep you fully informed, and be 
cause the accounts which Mr Short has given you will throw 
light on the same subject. I have already troubled you with 
some ideas respecting the interior state of Great Britain, and I 
add here my opinion, that sooner or later they must go into 
the war. Mr Hammond's manoeuvres will give you some good 
clue, I think, and perhaps hostile decisions at St James's may 
produce pacific dispositions among the Indian tribes. I am 
sure I need not add that it would be well to make the Indians, 
as the price of peace, declare who set them on. Perhaps in 
resentment of that conduct which may be pursued, they may 
take it in their heads to make Mr Simcoe a visit. 
</p><p>
The Elector of Hanover, as member of the German Empire, must come into the field ; and from inclination and interest he will do so, I think, fully. The contingent of Saxony 
will be sent forward with speed, and notwithstanding the debauched temper of the Elector of Bavaria, as his dominions in 
the Palatinate are exposed, as well as his Dutchy of Juliers, 
he must exert himself. A strong squadron of British men of 
war would rouse all Italy. And without them, the French 
arms may make considerable progress in that fertile, feeble 
country. 
As to Spain, I think the court is too corrupt, and too profligate, to make any considerable efforts. Bankrupt, almost, in full 
peace, with the mines of Mexico and Peru at their disposal, 
what would a war produce ? The chances are, that France 
will make an inroad, rather than suffer one in that quarter. 
Russia menaces, but the state of her finances, and the great distance, must make her efforts fall short of her wishes. Every 
art is used on each side to influence the Turk, and I own to 
you, that I rather apprehend that England and the Imperial 
Courts combined will prove successful, especially as Monsieur 
de Choiseul Gouffier is now openly active there on the part of 
the emigrant Princes. Should his Highness interfere, he will 
draw after him all the Barbary powers ; and the want of the 
grain usually drawn from them, will not be the least evil that 
will thereby fall upon the Provinces bordering on the Mediterranean sea. 
</p><p>
Austria and Prussia are making their utmost efforts, and the 
Prince of Hesse, who (strange as it may seem) is adored by his 
subjects, will second those efforts to the utmost of his ability. 
</p><p>
Such, my dear Sir, is the foreign storm lowering over this 
country, in which you will see, that my predictions respecting 
corn, have been hitherto exactly verified. How they are to obtain supplies from abroad, in the face of the maritime powers, I 
own myself at a loss to conjecture. It is nevertheless in this 
awful moment, and immediately after expediting the orders 
to recruit their army to six hundred thousand effectives, in order to sustain the land war, that they affect to wish Britain 
would declare against them, and actually menace, as you see,

contend that the treaty made with the King is at least suspended, if not abrogated, by the abrogation of his office and authority. Without entering into the numerous arguments on this subject, some of them forcible, and all of them plausible, I will only pray your indulgence while I express my wish that all our

government, we may not know in what manner, or to what 
person, our obligations are to be acquitted.
