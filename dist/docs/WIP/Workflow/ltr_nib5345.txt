My dear sir, 
</p><p>
In my quiet seclusion I watch with great anxiety the progress of things at Washington and as lookers on at the 
game sometimes see a move which may escape the busy players, I venture to make a suggestion. It is prompted by 
an intense sensitiveness to the present state of the country by my desire to see your administration prosper and more 
especially by the instinctive wish to come to the aid of one [for] whom I have long entertained a sincere personal z regard 
at the moment when he is overcome by numbers. 
</p><p>
It is manifest that your opponents are striving to make you odious as an enemy to the interests protected by the 
Tariff 3 which you are ready to sacrifice in order to gratify your personal dislike to <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay's</a> favorite measure. 
</p><p>
Now if I understand your last veto You do not dislike 
the Tariff bill itself &amp; you would have signed it but for its 
connection with the Distribution clause. If this be so, you 
have a chance of striking one of those master strokes which 
decide instantly the fate of the campaigns. It is this : 
</p><p>
To send immediately a message to Congress, urging, in consideration of the exhausted State of the Treasury a revenue bill 
exactly like that vetoed bill word for word, or as near as you can to it without saying anything about the Distribution 
clause. Look at the effect of it. If it succeeds, if your adversaries dare not vote against it it is your triumph your 
measure a popular measure for the country cares only for the Tariff &amp; comparatively little for the Distribution. 
But if it fails if your opponents vote against it, you will have done your duty. . . . 
</p>
