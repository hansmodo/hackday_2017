Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to acknowledge your favors of the tenth 
of March, and twenty-eighth of April. My last was of the 
twenty-fifth of April. As Mr Short remained here until the 
second instant, and was better acquainted with the current 
transactions, I relied on him for the communication of them. 
He informed you, that we obtained an interview with M. Dumouriez on the fifteenth of May. In this interview he told 
me, that he thought it was best I should be presented to 
the King immediately, but yet my first audience did not take 
place until the third of this month. He apologised for this de 
lay, as proceeding from the state of public affairs, which kept 
him continually occupied and agitated. I shall have occasion 
presently to say something about them. 
</p><p>
In our first conversation, as a fair, opportunity presented it 
self, I made use of it to tell him that, during my residence here 
in a private character, I had, as well from my attachment to 
the cause of liberty in general, as to the interests of France in 
particular, endeavored to effectuate some changes in the Constitution, which appeared to me essential to its existence. 
That, being now in a public character, I thought it my duty to 
avoid all interference in their affairs, of which, from henceforth, 
I should be a mere spectator. I will not trouble you with repeating what passed at my reception by the King and Queen. 
</p><p>
On the next day I dined with M. Dumouriez, and delivered 
the letter from the President to the King, on his acceptance of 
the constitution, of which letter I had previously made a translation, to avoid mistakes of their agents, which are not uncommon. Several members of the Corps Diplomatique have spoken to me on the subject of this letter, which has given them a high idea of the President's wisdom. I took occasion, according to your instructions, to mention the obnoxious acts of the late 
Assembly, both to M. Dumouriez, and to M. Bonne-Carrere, 
his confidential secretary. The latter told me that he coincided witk me in opinion fully on that subject, but that nothing 
could be done till they brought the Assembly into more consistency. That they could indeed command a majority, but that 
they could not bring that majority into a support of other measures than those of the moment. That, however, we might digest the business, and put it in train. M. Dumouriez told me 
that his system of politics was extremely simple. That a power so great as France stood in no need of alliances, and there 
fore he- was against all treaties other than those of commerce. 
That he would very readily enter with me into a consideration 
of a treaty of commerce, but wished me to defer it until he 
should return from the frontiers. 
</p><p>
In order that you may fully understand the facts, which I shall 
have occasion to communicate, I think it most advisable to 
mention the state of affairs in this country, such as it appears 
to me. I shall avoid speaking of characters, for evident reasons. You are already informed, I suppose, of the reasons 
which led to a declaration of war against the King of Hungary, 
and you know that the hope of an insurrection in the Austrian 
Flanders was among the reasons. Indeed, the intention to 
excite it, and the efforts made to that effect, have, (for the first 
time. I believe, in modern days) been publicly avowed. This 
hope has hitherto proved fallacious, and indeed as far as can 
be judged from the temper and character of the Flemish people, and from the information I have been able to collect, it 
seems to be the better opinion, that however they may feel an 
aversion to the Austrian government, they are still less disposed 
to that of France. There is, therefore, no probability of any 
capital diversion in that quarter, and the chance of it is daily 
decreasing, from two natural causes. First, the French troops 
are extremely undisciplined ; and secondly, the force of their 
enemies will soon receive very considerable additions. 
On the first of these heads I need say nothing, since you will 
receive from various quarters the sufficient evidences. In respect to the latter, having combined all the intelligence which 
can be relied on, it results that about the middle of next month 
the allied armies will be one hundred and eighty thousand 
strong, exclusive of the French emigrants. 
</p><p>
It is doubtful whether these last will be permitted to act, 
and for the following reasons. First, it is not to be supposed 
that twenty thousand gentlemen volunteers serving at their own 
expense can be well disciplined ; consequently it is to be apprehended that they will be more injurious to their friends than to 
their enemies. Secondly, it is next to impossible that in such 
a number, all irritated by injuries either real or supposed, there 
should not be some who will act more from motives of private 
vengeance, than regard to public good, and it is certain that 
acts of cruelty and injustice will rather tend to prolong than 
terminate the contest, at least to give it that termination which 
they wish for. Thirdly, it is notorious that the great mass of 
the French nation is less solicitous to preserve the present order of things, than to prevent the return of the ancient oppres 
sions, and of course would more readily submit to a pure despotism, than to that kind of monarchy whose only limits were 
found in those noble, legal, and clerical corps, by which the 
people were alternately oppressed and insulted. 
</p><p>
And this observation leads naturally to the object of the 
combined powers, which I conceive to be the establishment of 
a military government on the ruins of that anarchic system 
which now prevails, and in the continuance of which no power 
but England has any interest. The others, seeing that without 
a counterpoise in the marine scale, Britain must possess the 
Empire of the Ocean, (which in the present commercial state 
of the world is a kind of universal empire,) cannot but wish to 
reestablish this kingdom. 
</p><p>
But a great question occurs. What kind of government 
shall be established ? The emigrants hope for their darling 
aristocracy; but it can hardly be supposed, that Kings will 
exert themselves to raise abroad what they labor incessantly to 
destroy at home, and more especially as the French revolution having been begun by the nobles, the example will be so 
much the more striking, if they become the victims of it. But 
if the allied monarchs have an interest in destroying the Aristocracy, they have a much stronger and a more evident interest in preventing a free and well poised system from being 
adopted. Such system must inevitably extend itself, and/or 
the neighboring powers to relax from their tyranny. If the 
court of Berlin could have been insensible to this truth, in 
which it is so deeply interested, the zealous reformers here 
would have not permitted the Prussian ministers to slumber 
over their danger. The desire to propagate and make converts to their opinions has led them so far, that the quarrel 
which might have been only political has become personal, and 
I have good reason to believe, notwithstanding the profound 
secrecy which is preserved respecting the designs of the grand 
alliance, that it is in contemplation to put all power into the 
hands of the King. 
</p><p>
Things have been prepared for that event by the inconsiderable partizans of liberty. In their eagerness to abolish ancient 
institutions they forgot that a monarchy without intermediate 
ranks is but another name for anarchy or despotism. The first, 
unhappily, exists to a degree scarcely to be paralleled, and 
such is the horror and apprehension, which licentious societies 
have universally inspired, that there is some reason to believe 
the great mass of French population would consider even despotism as a blessing, if accompanied with security to person 
and property, such as is experienced under the worst governments in Europe. 
</p><p>
Another great means of establishing despotism here, is to 
be found in that national bankruptcy which seems to be inevitable. The expense of the last month exceeded the income 
by about ten millions of dollars. This expense continues to 
increase, and the revenue to diminish. The estate of the 
clergy is consumed, and the debt is as great as at the opening 
of the States-General. The current expense has, by taking 
away the property of the church, been increased about a sixth. 
The dilapidation in every department is unexampled, and they 
have, to crown all, an increasing paper money, which already 
amounts to above three hundred millions of dollars. 
</p><p>
From such facts it is impossible not to draw the most sinister presages. The country people have hitherto been actuated 
in a great measure by the hope of gain. The abolition of 
tithes, of feudal rights, and burthensome taxes, was so pleasant that a cold examinatibn of consequences could not be admitted ; still less an inquiry into the strict measure of justice. 
</p><p>
Next to the abolition came on those philosophical and math ematical arrangements of the Fisc, which are very beautiful and 
satisfactory, and to which there lies but one objection of any 
consequence, which is, that they are inexecutable. Now I 
have frequently observed, that when men are brought to abandon the paths of justice, it is not easy to arrest their progress 
at any particular point, and therefore, as the whole kingdom 
(Paris excepted) is interested in the non-payment of taxes, 
the question will be decided without much difficulty, if once 
the legislature get out of this city. 
</p><p>
They are already preparing for a march, and it is intended 
to take the King with them, to which effect a decree has al 
ready passed to disband his life guard, and another to collect 
20,000 men to the northward of this city. An opposition will be made by the Parisian militia to the latter decree, 
because they begin to perceive the object ; and as it seems to 
be a pretty general opinion among them, that no capital opposition will be made to the Austrian and Prussian troops, they 
consider the person of Louis the Sixteenth as forming the 
most solid reliance they have to protect them from plunder and 
outrage. This decree may therefore occasion either a schism 
between the militia and the Assembly, or among the inhabitants 
of Paris, or both. 
</p><p>
Already there exists a serious breach between the members 
of the present administration, and a part of them must go out. 
I have the best reason to believe, that the whole will be changed 
before many weeks, and some of them within a few days. 
There exists also a mortal enmity between different parties in 
the Assembly. At the head of the Jacobin faction is the 
Deputation of Bourdeaux, and that city is, as you know, particularly indisposed to our commercial interests. It is this 
state of universal hostility, or rather confusion, to which Dumouriez alluded when he apologised for delaying my audience. And it was this also that his confidant had in view, when 
he mentioned the necessity of waiting for a greater consistency 
in the legislature, before anything could be done. 
</p><p>
I mentioned to you above, that M. Dumouriez had it in contemplation to visit the frontiers. This was in his quality of principal minister, and certainly not as minister of Foreign Affairs. 
One of his principal advisers tells me that he has dissuaded him 
from taking that step. The object was to bring the army to action ; for having brought on a state of hostility, of which personally he is deeply concerned in the success, he has little 
hope unless from a coup de main, before the armies of the ene 
my are collected. In consequence, he has given repeated orders to fight, both to Monsieur Luckner and Monsieur La fayette. The former has declined, and the latter peremptorily 
refused ; the situation of their respective armies not permitting 
any well grounded expectations. At present the two armies 
are in march to form a junction, when the whole will be commanded by Monsieur Luckner. It is expected that he will be 
at the head of sixty thousand picked troops, and the Austrians 
cannot well oppose above thirty-five thousand. It is said that 
they are to act immediately, but I have pretty good reason to 
believe that the stroke will be about the twentieth to the twenty-fifth. 
</p><p>
M. Dumouriez told me that he was perfectly easy in respect to Prussia, whose only object was to get the House of 
Austria fairly engaged, and then to take advantage of its embarrassments. I told him that he must of course be well informed 
on that subject, but that since the departure of the Prussian minister, without taking leave, I could not but suppose the intentions of that court were more serious than he imagined. He 
gave me many reasons for his opinion, which I should have 
supposed to be only an ostensible one, if his intimates had not 
on another occasion quoted it to me, and if I did not know the 
principal channel through which he derives his intelligence. A 
late circumstance will tend rather to establish than remove this 
opinion ; I mean the attack of Poland by the Empress of Russia to overturn the new constitution, Whether this movement 
be in concert with the Austrian and Prussian cabinets or not, is 
doubtful. I cannot as yet make up any tolerable judgment on 
the subject, but I believe that in either case those cabinets will 
pursue their objects in regard to this country. 
</p><p>
The details I have entered into, and the informations which 
you will collect from the public prints, will show that in the 
present moment it will be very difficult to excite attention to 
other objects, than those by which they are so strongly agitated. 
The best picture I can give of the French nation is, that of 
cattle before a thunder storm. And as to the government, every member of it is engaged in the defence of himself, or the 
attack of his neighbor. I shall, notwithstanding, pursue the 
objects which you recommend. The obstacles to success form 
but incitements to the attempt. It must however be made 
with caution, because any sudden change of affairs may bring 
forward persons, who would oppose a measure merely because 
their predecessors had approved of it. 
</p><p>
You desired me among other things to send you the Moniteur, 
but the editor of that paper does not give so faithful a report of 
what passes in the Assembly, as you will find in the Logographe. 
If there be any one of the Gazetteers who is impartial, it 
is the author, or rather transcriber, of this. I send you of course 
the Gazette of France, which says, you know, whatever the ministry orders it to say. The Patriots Frangais, written by M. Brissot, will give you the republican side of the question, as the 
Gazette Universette does that of the kind of monarchy proposed by the constitution. The paper called the Indicateuris written by a party, who wish a more vigorous executive, although 
(strange to tell) this party consists of the persons, who in the 
beginning of the late Assembly did everything to bring the kingdom into the situation now experienced. The journal of the 
Jacobins will give you what passes in that society. The Gazette of Ley den, which I transmit according to your request, 
will convey a kind of digest of all these different sentiments 
and opinions. Thus, Sir, if you have the patience to look over 
these several papers, you will have a clear view not only of 
what is done, but of what is intended. 
</p><p>
For the present I take my leave, with the assurances of that 
sincere respect and esteem, with which I am yours,
