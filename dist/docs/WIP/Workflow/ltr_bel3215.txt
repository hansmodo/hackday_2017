DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the 10th instant. General 
Stark, by his last letter, informed me his troops should join your Honor ; since which, I have heard of his march ; therefore have 
inclosed your letter to him. I should not have been short of 
ammunition, had the militia from the Massachusetts attended to 
the orders of the Court, and had the ball sent from Springfield 
and <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> been of a size suitable for the muskets. 
</p><p>
On our movement this way, the few enemy, who were at 
Skenesborough, left it, after burning a number of boats. We 
have in camp about two thousand men, and now a prospect of a 
supply of flour. On the return of the scouts, now out, I expect a good account of the enemy's situation ; shall not fail, immediately, by scouts and heavier detachments, to attempt giving that 
diversion to <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> which we contemplated my movement here would effect. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bel" rel="me">BENJAMIN LINCOLN</a>.
