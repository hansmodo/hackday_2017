MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
KNOWING your taste for political speculations, I send 
you a couple of pamphlets for your amusement. 
The American production is said to have been writ 
ten by a senator from Virginia, Mr. Taylor ; I know 
not how truly. It is like his style, spirit, opinions, 
and sentiments. 
</p><p>
There is too much foundation for some of his observations ; but, although he has told some truth he 
has not told the whole truth, and he has told some 
thing that is not truth. One Bank of the United 
States, with its branches strictly limited in its operations, would be useful, but the State legislatures have 
multiplied banks to such a degree that one knows 
not how far the evil has already gone, nor where it 
will stop.
