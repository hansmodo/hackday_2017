SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with your Excellency's letter, of the 
31st of last month, by Captain Baylor, who hath 
purchased the warlike stores imported by Messrs. 
Clarke & Nightingale. The prices appear to be very 
high ; but, considering the cost, expenses, and risk, I 
believe they are as low as can reasonably be expected. 
</p><p>
In the letter I did myself the honor to write you 
by Mr. Brown, I mentioned the extreme scarcity of 
tow-cloth in the Colony. There is indeed none to 
be purchased. 
</p><p>
The Committee, appointed to act during the recess 
of the General Assembly, have given your proposal 
for taking the powder from Bermuda a full consideration, and have come to a resolution to make 
the attempt. Captain Abraham Whipple, the commander of the two armed vessels in the service of 
this Colony, who hath been very ill, but is now 
upon the recovery, hath been consulted, and will 
undertake the enterprise as soon as his health will 
permit. He is deemed the most suitable person to 
conduct it that we have. He requests your Excellency to give him a line under your hand, assuring 
the people of Bermuda that, in case of their assistance, you will recommend it to the Continental Congress to permit them to fetch provisions for the use 
of the Island. He does not propose to make any 
use of it, unless he shall find it utterly impracticable 
to obtain the powder without their assistance. I am, 
with much esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient Humble servant, 
</p><p>
