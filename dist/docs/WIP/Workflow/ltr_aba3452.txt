SIR 
</p><p>
Had you been no other than the private inhabitant of 
<a href='/results.php?city=monticello' rel='city'>Monticello</a>, I should, ere this time, have addressed 
you with that sympathy which a recent event has 
awakened in my bosom ; but reasons of various kinds 
withheld my pen, until the powerful feelings of my 
heart burst through the restraint, and called upon me 
to shed the tear of sorrow over the departed remains 
of your beloved and deserving daughter. An event 
which I most sincerely mourn. 
The attachment which I formed for her, when 
you committed her to my care upon her arrival 
in a foreign land, under circumstances peculiarly 
interesting, has remained with me to this hour ; 
and the account of her death, which I read in a 
late paper, recalled to my recollection the tender 
scene of her separation from me, when with the 
strongest sensibility, she clung around my neck and 
wet my bosom with her tears, saying, " Oh ! now I 
have learned to love you, why will they take me 
from you." 
</p><p>
It has been some time since I conceived that any 
event in this life could call forth feelings of mutual 
sympathy. But I know how closely entwined around 
a parent's heart are those cords which bind the 
parental to the filial bosom ; and when snapped 
asunder, how agonising the pangs. I have tasted of 
the bitter cup and bow with reverence and submission 
before the great Dispenser of it, without whose permission and overruling <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, not a sparrow 
falls to the ground. That you may derive comfort 
and consolation in this day of your sorrow and affliction from that only source calculated to heal the 
wounded heart, a firm belief in the being, perfections and attributes of God, is the sincere and ardent 
wish of her, who once took pleasure in subscribing 
herself your friend 
</p><p>
Abigail Adams.
