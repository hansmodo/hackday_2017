MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
ON the 13th of February I left you. It is now the 
3d of June, and I have not received a line, nor heard 
a word, directly nor indirectly, concerning you, since 
my departure. This is a situation of mind in which I 
never was before, and I assure you, I feel a great deal 
of anxiety at it ; yet I do not wonder at it, because I 
suppose few vessels have sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> since 
ours. I have shipped for you the articles you re 
quested, and the black cloth for your father, to whom present my most affectionate and dutiful respects. 
Captain Tucker, if he should not be unlucky, will 
give you an account of your things. 
</p><p>
It would be endless to attempt a description of this 
country. It is one great garden. Nature and art 
have conspired to render every thing here delightful. 
Religion and government, you will say, ought to be 
excepted. With all my heart. But these are no 
afflictions to me, because I have well fixed it in rny 
mind as a principle, that every nation has a right to 
that religion and government, which it chooses, and 
as long as any people please themselves in these 
great points, I am determined they shall not displease me. 
</p><p>
There is so much danger that my letter may fall 
into malicious hands, that I should not choose to be 
too free in my observations upon the customs and 
manners of this people. But thus much I may say 
with truth and without offence, that there is no people 
in the world who take so much pains to please, nor 
any whose endeavors in this way have more success. 
Their arts and manners, taste and language, are 
more respected in Europe than those of any other nation. Luxury, dissipation and effeminacy are pretty 
nearly of the same degree of excess here, and in 
every other part of Europe. The great cardinal virtue of temperance, however, I believe, flourishes here 
more than in any other part of Europe. 
</p><p>
My dear countrymen ! how shall I persuade you to 
avoid the plague of Europe ! Luxury has as many 
and as bewitching charms on your side of the ocean 
as on this ; and luxury, wherever she goes, effaces 
from human nature the image of the Divinity. 
If I had power I would forever banish and exclude 
from America all gold, silver, precious stones, alabaster, marble, silk, velvet and lace. 
</p><p>
0, the tyrant ! the American ladies would say. 
What ! Ay, my dear girls, these passions of yours 
which arc so easily alarmed, and others of my own 
sex which are exactly like them, have done, and will 
do the work of tyrants in all ages. Tyrants different 
from me, whose power has banished, not gold indeed, 
but other things of greater value, wisdom, virtue and 
liberty. My son and servant are well. I am, with 
an ardor that words have not power to express. 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
