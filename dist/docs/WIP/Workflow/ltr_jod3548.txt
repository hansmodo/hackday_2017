MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE peace, which sets the rest of the world at ease, 
increases, I think, my perplexities and anxiety. I 
have written to Congress a resignation, but I foresee 
there will not be a speedy decision upon it, and I 
shall be left in a state of suspense that will be intolerable. Foreseeing this, I am determined not to 
wait for an acceptance of my resignation, but to come 
home without it, provided it does not arrive in a reasonable time. Don t think, therefore, of coming to 
Europe. If you do, we shall cross each other, 
and I shall arrive in America about the same time 
that you may arrive in Europe. 
</p><p>
I shall certainly return home in the spring. With 
or without leave, resignation accepted or not, home I 
will come, so you have nothing to do but wait to receive your old friend 
</p><p>
