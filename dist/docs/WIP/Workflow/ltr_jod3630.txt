MT DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I AM not surprised at your anxiety expressed in your 
letter of the 25th, which I received yesterday. The conduct of certain mules has been so gloomy and obstinate for five months past, as to threaten the most 
dangerous effects. The proceedings of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, New 
York, and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> now, compared with their in 
temperate folly last July or August, is a curious specimen of negotiations with foreign courts and nations 
by the people at large in town meetings. Those 
cities have disgraced themselves and their leaders. 
</p><p>
The House yesterday, in committee, voted to make 
the appropriations, but in the House they will disgrace 
themselves again by party manoeuvres to-day, and by 
factious preambles or preparatory resolutions. Our V , who is as cross a goat as any from Virginia, not excepting Rutherford, was out of the way. An 
other member, Patten from Delaware, was absent. 
Both will vote to-day against the resolution ; so that 
the business is still in suspense, and the anxiety and 
vigilance of the people ought not to relax. Mr. Ames, the day before yesterday, in his feeble state, 
scarcely able to stand upon his legs, and with much 
difficulty finding breath to utter his periods, made one 
of the best speeches he ever produced, to the most 
crowded audience ever assembled. He was attended 
to with a silence and interest never before known, 
and he made an impression that terrified the hardiest 
and will never be forgotten. Judge Iredell and I 
happened to sit together. Our feelings beat in unison. " My God ! how great he is," says Iredell, 
" how great he has been !" " He has been noble," 
said I. After some time Iredell breaks out, " Bless 
my stars, I never heard any thing so great since I 
was born ! " " It is divine," said I ; and thus we 
went on with our interjections, not to say tears, till the 
end. Tears enough were shed. Not a dry eye, I 
believe, in the House, except some of the jackasses 
who had occasioned the necessity of the oratory. 
These attempted to laugh, but their visages " grinned 
horribly ghastly smiles." They smiled like Foulon's 
son-in-law when they made him kiss his father's 
dead and bleeding head. Perhaps the speech may 
not read as well. The situation of the man excited 
compassion, and interested all hearts in his favor. 
The ladies wished his soul had a better body.

We are told Harri. Otis excelled at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and 
displayed great oratorical talents. I cannot give 
encouragement, nor entertain any hope, of getting 
away before the fifth of June, unless the hard hearts 
should be softened. The heart of Pharaoh was judicially hardened and so are those of . Massachusetts has three of the worst.

I am, most tenderly,
