SIR: 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 8th instant late last evening. I now write to 
Heriot and Tucker about the indigo, which you will forward to 
them. I answered your former letter respecting Mr. Philip Porcher, 
by referring you to the orders I had given respecting those who should 
come from within the enemy's lines; lest any accidents should have 
happened to that dispatch, I now enclose it. These orders are general, 
therefore unnecessary to observe upon the other. I have already in 
formed you that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself agreed to the last proposition 
you made respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, which was to continue <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> dismounted, to act as infantry. If the matter can be 
accommodated upon this plan, I shall give myself no further trouble 
about it, as they have so little time to serve. Whilst I am on this subject, I must take notice of the conduct of Mr. Thomas Drayton, who 
was sent to the southward to impress horses. He has made so improper 
a use of the authority given him, that I have been obliged to order him 
on no account to impress another horse, and to return such as he had 
impressed. The reason of my ordering him to return those he had 
taken was, that at all events Maham would have <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's horses</a>, and 
consequently could not want more; however, whether the thing takes 
place or not, the impressing of horses is attended with such ruinous 
consequences, that I am determined not to countenance it. You will, 
therefore, sir, look upon the authority given you on the 6th of March 
last, for impressing horses, as hereby revoked. I have given no com 
missions in the second regiment. I did give <a href='/results.php?tla=top' rel='colleague'>Mr. Thomas Pinckney</a> a 
certificate for a commission in the first regiment before I knew of the 
form observed for commissions in the regiments of this State. You say 
the application can only be made to the Colonel of the regiment. In this 
</p><p>
case the Governor, who has the sole right to appoint if he chooses to 
exercise it, becomes a mere machine. At all events, I shall expect a 
decent regard to be paid to any recommendation from me. This is a 
point I do not think I am at liberty to give up. I should be glad Mr. Hall's baggage was sent forward, as the public papers in it are much 
wanted. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with esteem and regard, your most obdt. servant, 
</p><p>
