Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received intelligence, that a party of the enemy are establishing themselves at or near <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a>, 
and building a blockhouse, or some kind of work. If 
they are permitted to complete their plan, it will not only be difficult to remove them, but they will harass the 
country from thence, and may be much in the way of 
some future operation. When I formed the battalion, 
which you at present command, it was with a view of 
having a corps ready to execute a project of the kind, 
which I propose to you, and that is, to endeavour to 
strike by surprise the party above mentioned. You 
will without loss of time see Captain Lawrence, who 
commands the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> levies near Dobbs's Ferry, 
and concert measures with him for gaining certain intelligence of the real strength and situation of the enemy ; and, if you find them such as seem to give you a 
tolerable certainty of success, you will plan your attack 
in such manner, as shall be best warranted from your information. the sooner it is done the better, as the 
enemy, if they are fortifying, will be every clay stronger. 
You will take Captain Lawrence under your command, 
with the levies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and any Jersey militia 
you may find embodied ; but you will trust no officer 
among them, nor any other but Lawrence, with your 
design. lie is sensible and appears discreet. 
</p><p>
As I coiiiide very much in your prudence and judgment, I shall only give you these general directions ; 
namely, to attempt nothing, which may have the appearance of rashness, and to guard well against being 
drawn into an ambuscade, or being intercepted by a 
sudden reinforcement from York Island. Captain Lawrence's party, who must be acquainted with every foot 
of the ground, ought to secure you against the former ; 
and guards, at the practicable landing-places, will certainly prevent the latter. I shall set out in the morning 
for Connecticut, and shall be absent six or seven days. 
If you make the attempt, I wish you every success. 
I am with great regard, &lc.
