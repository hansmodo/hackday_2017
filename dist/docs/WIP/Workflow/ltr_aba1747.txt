MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
YOUR letter, last evening received from Bilboa, relieved me from much anxiety ; for, having a day or 
two before received letters from your papa, Mr. Thaxter, and brother in which packet I found none 
from you, nor any mention made of you, my mind, ever fruitful in conjectures, was instantly alarmed. 
I feared you were sick, unable to write, and your papa, unwilling to give me uneasiness, had concealed it from me ; and this apprehension was confirmed by every person's omitting to say how long they should continue in Bilboa. 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jod" rel="me">Your father's</a> letters came to Salem, yours to Newburyport, and soon gave ease to my anxiety, at 
the same time that it excited gratitude and thankfulness to Heaven, for the preservation you all experienced in the imminent dangers which threatened 
you. You express in both your letters a degree of thankfulness. I hope it amounts to more than words, 
and that you will never be insensible to the particular preservation you have experienced in both your 
voyages. You have seen how inadequate the aid of man would have been, if the winds and the seas had 
not been under the particular government of that Being, who " stretched out the heavens as a span," 
who " holdeth the ocean in the hollow of his hand," and " rideth upon the wings of the wind." 
</p><p>
If you have a due sense of your preservation, your next consideration will be, for what purpose you are 
continued in life. It is not to rove from clime to clime, to gratify an idle curiosity ; but every new 
mercy you receive is a new debt upon you, a new obligation to a diligent discharge of the various relations in which you stand connected ; in the first place, 
to your great Preserver ; in the next, to society in general ; in particular, to your country, to your parents, and to yourself. 
</p><p>
The only sure and permanent foundation of virtue is religion. Let this important truth be engraven upon your heart. And also, that the foundation 
of religion is the belief of the one only God, and a just sense of his attributes, as a being infinitely 
wise, just, and good, to whom you owe the highest reverence, gratitude, and adoration ; who superintends and governs all nature, even to clothing the 
lilies of the field, and hearing the young ravens when they cry ; but more particularly regards man, whom 
he created after his own image, and breathed into him an immortal spirit, capable of a happiness beyond the grave ; for the attainment of which he is 
bound to the performance of certain duties, which all tend to the happiness and welfare of society, and are 
comprised in one short sentence, expressive of universal benevolence, " Thou shalt love thy neighbour 
as thyself." This is elegantly defined by Mr. Pope, 
in his " Essay on Man." 
</p><p>
" Remember, man, the universal cause Acts not by partial, but by general laws, 
And makes what happiness we justly call, Subsist not in the good of one, but all. 
There's not a blessing individuals find, But some way leans and hearkens to the kind. 
</p><p>
Thus has the Supreme Being made the good will of man towards his fellow-creatures an evidence of 
his regard to Him, and for this purpose has constituted him a dependent being and made his happiness 
to consist in society. Man early discovered this propensity of his nature, and found 
</p><p>
" Eden was tasteless till an Eve was there." 
</p><p>
Justice, humanity, and benevolence are the duties you owe to society in general. To your country 
the same duties are incumbent upon you, with the additional obligation of sacrificing ease, pleasure, 
wealth, and life itself for its defence and security. To your parents you owe love, reverence, and obedience to all just and equitable commands. To your 
self, here, indeed, is a wide field to expatiate upon. To become what you ought to be, and what a fond 
mother wishes to see you, attend to some precepts and instructions from the pen of one, who can have 
no motive but your welfare and happiness, and who wishes in this way to supply to you the personal 
watchfulness and care, which a separation from you deprived you of at a period of life, when habits are 
easiest acquired and fixed ; and, though the advice may not be new, yet suffer it to obtain a place in your 
memory, for occasions may offer, and perhaps some concurring circumstances unite, to give it weight and force. 
</p><p>
Suffer me to recommend to you one of the most useful lessons of life, the knowledge and study of 
yourself. There you run the greatest hazard of being deceived. Self-love and partiality cast a mist 
before the eyes, and there is no knowledge so hard to be acquired, nor of more benefit when once 
thoroughly understood. Ungoverned passions have aptly been compared to the boisterous ocean, which 
is known to produce the most terrible effects. " Passions are the elements of life," but elements which 
are subject to the control of reason. Whoever will candidly examine themselves, will find some degree 
of passion, peevishness, or obstinacy in their natural tempers. You will seldom find these disagreeable 
ingredients all united in one ; but the uncontrolled indulgence of either is sufficient to render the possessor unhappy in himself, and disagreeable to all who are so unhappy as to be witnesses of it, or suffer from its effects. 
</p><p>
You, my dear son, are formed with a constitution feelingly alive ; your passions are strong and impetuous ; and, though I have sometimes seen them hurry 
you into excesses, yet with pleasure I have observed a frankness and generosity accompany your 
efforts to govern and subdue them. Few persons are so subject to passion, but that they can command themselves, when they have a motive sufficiently strong ; and those who are most apt to transgress will restrain themselves through respect and 
reverence to superiors, and even, where they wish to recommend themselves, to their equals. The due 
government of the passions, has been considered in all ages as a most valuable acquisition. Hence an 
inspired writer observes, " He that is slow to anger, is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city." This passion, 
cooperating with power, and unrestrained by reason, has produced the subversion of cities, the desolation of countries, the massacre of nations, and filled 
the world with injustice and oppression. Behold your own country, your native land, suffering from 
the effects of lawless power and malignant passions, and learn betimes, from your own observation and 
experience, to govern and control yourself. Having once obtained this self-government, you will find a foundation laid for happiness to yourself and use 
fulness to mankind. " Virtue alone is happiness below ;" and consists in cultivating and improving every good inclination, and in checking and subduing every propensity to evil. I have been particular upon the passion of anger, as it is generally the most predominant passion at your age, the soonest 
excited, and the least pains are taken to subdue it ; 
</p><p>
" what composes man, can man destroy." 
</p><p>
I do not mean, however, to have you insensible to real injuries. He who will not turn when he is 
trodden upon is deficient in point of spirit ; yet, if you can preserve good breeding and decency of 
manners, you will have an advantage over the aggressor, and will maintain a dignity of character, 
which will always insure you respect, even from the offender. 
</p><p>
I will not overburden your mind at this time. I mean to pursue the subject of self-knowledge in 
some future letter, and give you my sentiments upon your future conduct in life, when I feel disposed to resume my pen. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, be assured, no one is more sincerely interested in your happiness, than your ever affectionate mother, 
</p><p>

Do not expose my letters. I would copy, but hate it.
