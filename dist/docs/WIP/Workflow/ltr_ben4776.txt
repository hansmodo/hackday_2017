DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of Saturday, early this Morning, 
and am as usual much obliged by the kind Readiness with 
which you have done what I requested. 
</p><p>
Your good Mother has complained more of her Head 
since you left us than ever before. If she stoops, or looks, or bends her Neck downwards, on any occasion, it is with 
great Pain and Difficulty, that she gets her Head up again. 
She has, therefore, borrowed a Breast and Neck Collar of 
Mrs. Wilkes, such as Misses wear, and now uses it to keep 
her Head up. Mr. Strahan has invited us all to dine there 
to-morrow, but she has excused herself. Will you come, 
and go with me? If you cannot well do that, you will at 
least be with us on Friday to go to Lady Strachans. 
</p><p>
As to my own Head, which you so kindly enquire after, 
its Swimming has gradually worn off, and to-day for the first 
Time I felt nothing of it on getting out of Bed. But, as this 
speedy Recovery is, (as I am fully persuaded) owing to the 
extream Abstemiousness I have observed for some Days 
past at home, I am not without Apprehensions, that, being 
to dine abroad this Day, to-morrow, and next Day, I may 
inadvertently bring it on again, if I do not think of my little 
Monitor and guardian Angel, and make use of the proper 
and very pertinent Clause she proposes, in my Grace. Here 
comes a Morning Visitor. Adieu. My best Respects to 
Mrs. Tickel. I am, my dear Friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
