MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I wish I had one of my nieces with me whilst I 
remain in this country ; but it will not be long before I shall q it it. Not ten days ago I expected to 
have taken my passage in the July packet, in consequence of some intelligence which afterwards wore 
a different appearance ; things are so fluctuating 
upon both sides the water, that it is really difficult to 
draw up conclusions. Prussia has treated, Portugal 
has treated, and the Emperor's minister has just received powers to treat also ; but, very unfortunately, 
the joint commission of the American ministers expired this month, so that nothing can be concluded 
until new powers arrive. Whoever has any thing to 
do with courts, must have patience for their first, 
second, and third requisites. I wish I was well out 
of the way of all of them. My object is to return 
to America early next spring, if nothing arises to 
oblige us to take this step sooner. I cannot think of 
a fall passage. Of this, I shall be better informed 
in a few weeks. But there is no office more undesirable than that of Minister of the United States ; 
under the present embarrassments, there is no reputation to be acquired, and there is much to lose. 
Negotiations with other powers may be and have 
been effected ; but with England there is not the 
least probability of a treaty, until the States are 
united in their measures, and invest Congress with 
full powers for the regulation of commerce. A 
minister here can be of very little service until that 
event takes place. It is true, he may be invested 
with other powers, and one, more important than 
treating with this country, is, making peace with the 
Barbary States ; but as <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> foretold, so it has 
turned out. Lamb is returning without being able to 
effect any thing. The Dey would not even see him, 
and the demand for the poor fellows who are in 
captivity is a thousand dollars per man, and there 
are twenty-one of them. The sum allotted by Congress is so inadequate to the thing, that we must 
look only for war upon us. Unless Congress endeavour to borrow the sum demanded, and treat immediately, their demands will increase in proportion 
to the captures they make ; but of all this they are 
regularly and fully informed. You will not, however, make these matters known till you hear them 
from some other quarter. These are dull subjects 
for one lady to write to another upon ; but our country is so much interested in these affairs, that you 
must excuse me for troubling you with them, and 
you can communicate with discretion. 
</p><p>
I thank you most sincerely for all your kindness 
to my dear sons, and hope they will ever bear a 
grateful remembrance of it ; the account you give 
of their behaviour and conduct is such as I hope 
they merit. The idea that their success in life depends upon their diligence and application to their 
studies, and a modest and virtuous deportment, cannot 
be too strongly impressed upon their minds. The 
foolish idea in which some of our youth are educated, 
of being born gentlemen, is the most ridiculous in 
the world for a country like ours. It is the mind 
and manners which make the gentleman, and not 
the estate. There is no man with us so rich as to 
breed up a family in idleness, with ideas of paternal 
inheritance, and far distant may that day be from 
our land ; he who is not in some way or other useful 
to society, is a drone in the hive, and ought to be 
hunted down accordingly. I have very different 
ideas of the wealth of my countrymen from what I 
had when I left. Much of that wealth has proved 
fallacious, and their debts exceed their property. 
Economy and industry may retrieve their affairs. I 
know that the country is capable of great exertions ; 
but, in order to this, they must curtail their ideas 
of luxury and refinement, according to their ability. 
I do not believe any country exceeds them in the 
article of dress. In houses, in furniture, in gardens 
and pleasure-grounds, and in equipage, the wealth of 
France and England is displayed to a high pitch of 
grandeur and magnificence ; but, when I reflect upon 
the thousands who are starving, and the millions who 
are loaded with taxes to support this pomp and show, 
I look to my happier country with an enthusiastic 
warmth, and pray for the continuance of that equality of rank and fortune which forms so large a portion of our happiness.

I yesterday dined at the Bishop of Saint Asaph's, 
in company with Dr. Priestley and Dr. Price and 
some strangers. The Bishop's character is well 
known and respected, as a friend to America, and 
justly does he deserve the character of a liberal 
man. He is polite, affable, and consequently agreeable. He has a lady and an unmarried daughter, 
both of whom are well-bred, according to my ideas ; 
according to British ideas, good breeding consists in 
an undaunted air and a fearless, not to say bold, address and appearance. The old lady is both sensible and learned, quite easy and social ; the young 
one is modest and attentive. This is a family, the 
friendship and acquaintance of which I should like 
to cultivate. 
</p><p>
Dr. Priestley is a gentleman of a pale complexion, 
spare habit, placid, thoughtful countenance, and 
very few words. I heard him preach for Dr. Price. 
His delivery is not equal to the matter of his discourses. I dined twice in company with the Doctor, 
and was mortified that I could not have more of his 
company at our own house, but he was engaged 
every moment of his time whilst in <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city'>London</a>. I believe I have frequently mentioned Dr. Price ; he is a good and amiable man, a little inclined to lowness 
of spirits which partly arises from the melancholy 
state of Mrs. Price, who two years ago had a paralytic stroke, and has been helpless ever sin ze. 
Believe me yours affectionately,
