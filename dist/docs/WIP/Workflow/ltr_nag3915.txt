DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I most sincerely congratulate you upon the very honorable check you 
gave the enemy, and I am happy to hear you give such ample testimony 
to the bravery and firmness of the militia. I wish in every part of the 
State they were equally deserving the same applause. From what has 
passed, you may see how little dependence is to be placed in the enemy's 
peaceable professions. It gives me the highest satisfaction to find that 
they are disappointed in their expectations of finding you off your guard, 
from the arts that had been practised to effect it. At the close of every 
month, you will give me a return of the Continental and State troops, 
and the militia serving under your command, specifying where they are 
employed, and for what purpose, as I want to give the minister of war 
as satisfactory an account as possible of the force of this country. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
