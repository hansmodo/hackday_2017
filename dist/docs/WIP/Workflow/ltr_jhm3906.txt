SIR: 
</p><p>
I enclose you the instructions for quieting the discontents of the 
people on Little Pee Dee, with whom you some time ago entered into 
a truce. The express brings you twenty commissions. I also enclose 
you an order for arms and ammunition. I think there is something 
else you mentioned to me in the course of our conversation to-day, but 
in the multiplicity of business I have engaged in since I came home, it 
has slipt my memory j you will, therefore, be pleased to repeat it to me 
by the return of the express I send you to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhm" rel="me">JOHN MATTHEWS</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Be pleased to send me your opinion in writing before you go 
away, whether it will be best to sell the negroes, and recruit with money, 
or continue on the old plan of recruiting with negroes.
