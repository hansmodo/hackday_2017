Dear General,
</p><p>
Very much fatigued, I arrived in New Hampshire 
in seven days from the time I left you, and am 
very happy to acquaint you that the people of New 
Hampshire behave with the greatest spirit. The six 
hundred men required, are, for the general part, on 
their march ; the nine hundred, I hope, will be ready 
to march by the middle of next week; and, by their 
present exertions, I cannot doubt but by that time 
they will be on the move. Some of them have already marched. I have directed them, at first, to 
rendezvous at Springfield. The way of Claverac is 
certainly much out of the route to the present station of the army; but, nevertheless, if you have any 
particular reasons for their moving by Claverac, let 
me know, and your orders shall be punctually complied with. 
</p><p>
I have conferred with the Committee. They tell 
me they have wrote, and are surprised their letters 
have not reached you. The State has collected, and 
are still collecting, cattle for the use of the army. 
Every one seems sanguinely determined to do something of importance this campaign. As soon as the 
main body has moved, I shall follow. Springfield 
will he my first stop. There I hope to hear from 
you ; but, if not, shall move agreeably to my instructions. I am, dear Sir, with much respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
