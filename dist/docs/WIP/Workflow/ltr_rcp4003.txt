Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Every occurrence in which you have shared, or originated, seems, by some strange perversion, to be misunderstood or misstated by the present generation, when some 
favourite individual or topic induces the obliquity. Although I give <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> his full share of merit in the 
affair of the Count de Vergennes' manoeuvring with the 
British administration on the subject of our treaty of <a href='/results.php?year=1783'>1783</a>, 
yet I have felt indignant that your name should have been 
omitted in the Massachusetts' Conventional account of the 
matter ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> held out as the principal figure, 
when you should have been the prominent and leading 
portrait in the group. I am sure Mr. Vaughan will not 
justify this statement of the transaction, though he is alluded 
to as confirming it by one of the speakers in the Massachusetts' Convention. His account of it to me was exactly 
as you stated it in your letter to Congress, which I and read at the time of its being the subject of our consideration; when, as I wrote to you, the unjustifiable vi 
Mas taken as to the unmerited censure of proceeding without the concurrence of the French ministry, in our adjustment with Great Britain. 
</p><p>
In your letter to me, in answer to my relation of what 
passed at this place in a conversation with Mr. Vaughan, 
a year or more ago, in relation to the affair, and when 
I told you he confirmed my recollections on the subject, you only refer to your letter to Congress. I think 
some additional statement of facts should be left, lest the 
archives of the office of state may suffer the catastrophe 
which destroyed all the records of transactions in the war 
office. The truth of history depends on fair and correct 
relations of the conduct of individuals to whom public 
transactions were committed. The biography of those individuals is one thing, the national character is another ; 
but both are united in the inquiry on this subject. 
</p><p>
Among the pleasures of memory (which has many pains) 
the recollection of old friendships is one of the most delightful. Among these, my remembrances of your personal 
regard is one of the most prominent gratifications. Whensoever any thing turns up in which you were concerned, 
all my sensibilities recur. 
</p><p>
I begin to feel some of the infirmities of age ; but, in 
general, am highly favoured with good health. The most 
extraordinary depression of property is no cordial to 
landed proprietors ; but those who will soon occupy a 
small portion, and leave their extensive possessions behind 
them, need not much deplore the "hard times" which have 
fallen on us. The friends of peace have nothing to encourage them, when universal peace brings along with it universal privation, and much distress to individuals. But we 
have wantoned in prosperity : and cannot bear the check which circumstances have given to our career â€” -festinalentc must hereafter be our motto. I trust you enjoy as 
much health as you have heretofore experienced, though I 
cannot flatter myself that it is perfect. My best wishes 
constantly attend you ; and I beg you to be assured of the 
sincere regard with which I am always 
</p><p>
Affectionately yours, 
</p><p>

P.S. I have just got home from the drudgery of a long 
circuit court, and am not the better for the campaign. 
Washington has begun his return to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, much 
broken down. He came convalescent ; having had a 
severe attack of an illness which pervaded all the country 
in his vicinity. He must renew his stamina, or he will not 
reach the period of life to which you and I have arrived.
