DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your kind and truly obliging favor, of the 28th 
ultimo, came safely to hand, and, the oftener I pe 
ruse it, the more fully sensible I am of the justice 
and importance of its contents. I do not know by 
what means the expected assistance from France has 
been procured; but it will certainly give a complex 
ion to the alliance in future, according to the reception it meets with here. I should be very apprehensive, from the different state of improvement of the 
two countries, and perverseness of human nature, 
which often leads us to expect more than can be obtained, and be chagrined at the disappointment, that, 
with all possible attention and care, difficulties will 
arise, and that it will greatly add to the burden laid 
upon you. But, if they should want necessaries, when 
the country abounds in them, we shall justly forfeit 
any pretensions to respect and friendship, and be 
come contemptible, not only to them, but to the 
world, and even to ourselves. Our difficulties lie 
with the rich, and not with the poor. While the war was conducted with emissions, the aid of the former 
was not wanted; that of the latter was to be had, 
and may be had now, upon the same terms, that is, 
giving them a support for their labors; but to fight 
and starve, or work and starve, are equally impracticable. 
</p><p>
In my opinion we have, in some degree, miscalculated the abilities of the country, and entirely the 
disposition of the people to bear taxes in the necessary extent. The country, not immediately the seat 
of either army, is richer than when the war began; 
but the long disuse of taxes, and their natural unpalatableness, have embarrassed the business exceedingly; and Tories, grumbling Whigs, and party, have 
all thrown in their aid to increase the discontent. 
These circumstances, which it was impossible to fore 
see in their full extent, made a foreign loan a matter of great importance, and even of indispensable necessity; and, if any thing has been omitted to obtain it, which we may yet retrieve, I should hope no 
time will be lost. 
</p><p>
The failure of the Eastern States to supply beef 
will be attended with some disagreeable effects here ; 
for all the money we had, or expected soon, has 
been furnished to procure this article, and, of course, 
our means of procuring flour proportionably diminished. The State made an effort, on this account, 
which no other has equalled, as they mortgaged an estate, belonging to the public, in the neighbourhood 
of this city, for the special purpose of supplying the 
army, leaving the taxes for the general use of the 
United States. But this money, though secure in 
every other event than that of our failing in the 
contest, and drawing an interest, has met with embarrassments and opposition, partly from interested 
and partly from other motives, which have very much 
delayed the supplies. We have, at length, got in 
motion, and, I hope, shall be able to get a supply of 
flour for the summer ; but the shock paper money 
has received, subjects all our resources to the ca 
price of interested or perverse individuals, more than 
is consistent with our safety or honor. 
</p><p>
The address of the Committee, accompanied with a 
letter from yourself, came at a seasonable moment, 
just as the House of Assembly was about to rise. 
They immediately passed a law for raising two men 
out of every company of militia, which I had endeavoured, but in vain, to effect last spring. This 
will produce about one thousand men from the whole 
State, about six hundred of which will go to fill 
up the ranks of the Continental army. The remainder we must endeavour to throw upon the fron 
tiers, or some of our oldest and most established 
counties are in danger of becoming a frontier. In 
short, there is no pacifying them without a body of 
troops, though experience has long decided how in 
adequate a defensive war is for support against the 
Indians. 
</p><p>
The representation of the distress for want of meat, 
produced an immediate exertion, of which I hope the 
benefit must be felt by this time. It is true, many 
of the cattle are not fit for slaughter, but they are 
the best we have. It was thought best to continue 
this business, at least for some weeks, in order to 
have a stock in possession, and of consequence they 
will be continued for some time; proceeding to camp 
upon this principle, that, if you have none better, 
these must serve, and if you have, the season of the 
year will admit their being kept till they are better. 
</p><p>
We had proceeded thus far, and there seemed to 
be a very good disposition in all to advance the necessary measures, with as much expedition as deliberative bodies usually do, or are capable of. The 
vesting extraordinary powers in the Executive was 
not so well relished, and it was too delicate a subject to be much pressed by me, especially as there 
appeared some reluctance on this point; and, it is 
probable, the House would have adjourned without 
touching upon it, had it not been so forcibly urged 
in your private letter. I was extremely embarrassed ; 
I did not see any chance of its being done, but by 
letting them know that it was deemed by you a 
matter not of mere importance, but of indispensable necessity. This was done in a manner the most 
guarded and confidential, and had the desired effect, 
as they have vested the Executive with the power 
to declare martial law, so far as they shall deem necessary? ftftd which gives us a power of doing what 
may be necessary, without attending to the ordinary 
forms of law. I have the pleasure to observe, the 
measure is generally satisfactory; and as we shall endeavour to exercise it with prudence and moderation, 
I hope it may be productive of the good effects expected from it. 
</p><p>
The loss of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, with its garrison, and stores, 
which I think a very probable event, notwithstanding 
the sanguine hopes of some, and doubts of others, 
will, it must be presumed, rouse us from the insensibility with which we have hitherto carried on the 
war since <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. And yet the scene is so distant, 
and the danger apparently remote, that I am not 
certain of this effect. The arrival of a few vessels 
from Statia, or capture of as many, seems to be an 
event more interesting, than an advantage gained or 
lost by the enemy, however considerable. And our country friends find their patriotism abate, as their 
interests are affected by duties or taxes. I am inclined to think some stroke of adverse fortune necessary, and that lasting good may flow from it ; for, 
pretend what we may, the country is so much re 
moved from the distress of the war, and really has 
the three requisites of war, men, provisions, and iron, 
if not in abundance, in sufficiency for all our wants, 
our only difficulty is to draw them forth. And for 
this, two things are essentially necessary; namely, 
union among the States, generally and particularly. 
The parties in Congress have weakened the influence and lessened the weight of that body, and the 
internal divisions have had the like effect on the Governments ; so that every measure, however necessary 
for the general good, has been timid, feeble, and languid, each fearing to give his adversary some advantage ; while the disaffected and mercenary have raised 
their heads, with an astonishing degree of insolence, 
to the great discouragement of the Whigs, especially 
in the middling and lower classes of life, who, having 
been distressed by their attachment to our cause, and 
their minds neither feeling, nor perhaps capable of 
feeling, what is called liberality of spirit towards an 
enemy, have been mortified to find themselves no 
way distinguished, but by their sufferings. It is clear that the Royal cause, both in this State and Mary, 
land, derives great advantage from the division of 
the Whigs ; for, in the rage and discontent of party, 
auxiliaries are so acceptable, that we are not apt 
to scrutinize their motives and principles too narrowly. Upon these considerations, I have ever thought 
it a most necessary duty to sacrifice, as far as I am 
capable, any smaller resentments, and, far from declining the paths of peace, to seek them. I have 
made more advances than one. The exposing my 
life to save that of my principal enemies, when they 
would otherwise have fallen a collective sacrifice to 
their own imprudence and to popular resentment, 
though an act of duty in my station, might have 
been evaded on many plausible pretexts. But it 
seems to be the allotment of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, that, in this 
respect, I am to be unhappy. 
</p><p>
Conceiving it a proper time to write, and make a 
great and general effort for our national safety and 
honor, a few days before I was favored with your sentiments on this subject, waiving all sorts of punctilio, I made a direct overture. I can only say, it 
was not accepted ; but it was of so explicit and unequivocal a nature, as to leave no farther ground, unless time and a change of circumstances should produce it. I am, however, happy to find, that I have 
met your opinion in this respect, and beg you to 
believe, not only that I was sincere on that occasion, 
but that, as the public good and your ease appear connected in some degree with it, I shall embrace 
any favorable opportunity to renew it. 
</p><p>
I feel, exceedingly feel, for the peculiarity of your situation, my dear Sir, and also fear that your health 
may suffer in the conflict. But when I consider what 
just conceptions you have of the importance of the 
prize for which we contend, the progress already, and 
the abounding affection and confidence of the country, I cannot but believe you may draw great consolation and support, that the present difficulties will 
lay a foundation for some system of solid supply, 
and a just consideration of the army, which has been 
too generally viewed through a very mistaken medium. For myself, I shall only add, that the same 
motives which led me to leave domestic enjoyments 
and lucrative ease, in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, and partake your early 
exertions, now strengthened by more knowledge and 
warmer attachment, will induce me to strain every 
nerve, and run every risk, to promote the public service, as the most acceptable testimony I can give 
you of the truth of these professions. And if there 
is any particular case or occasion, which, from want 
of knowledge or information, I may be likely to 
overlook, I shall esteem it a particular favor to be 
honored with a few lines, to which I shall pay the 
most special and animated attention. 
I think it very happy, that Major Lee's corps is 
in the vicinity of this place; as, in case of emergency, they may be wanted to execute measures which, 
though necessary, are unpalatable, and often ill executed, where the feelings of acquaintance and personal friendship operate against the public measures. 
They are in exceeding good quarters, on the best terms with the inhabitants, and, I presume, must be 
far too late to render any assistance to our friends 
in the south. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Heed, who is pretty well recovered, returns 
her respectful regards and thanks to Mrs. Washing 
ton and yourself for your polite attention, in which I 
beg leave to include mine; and am, with the most 
unfeigned respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
