Rev. Sir, 
</p><p>
Accept my thanks for your obliging letter of the 9th ult., and the interesting discourse which accompanied it. The 
eighteenth century has been distinguished, as you observe, by great events. There are some of them so singular 
and apparently so ominous, that the present century will probably not be less signal than the last; especially as 
whole nations are suffering themselves from their great sovereign by promises of liberty made to them by the servants of corruption, and are desiring and exalting 
rulers who contemptuously refuse to "kiss the Son." 
</p><p>
I perfectly agree with you in the sentiment, that our business is to do our duty, and leave events to Him, without whose appointment and permission nothing comes to 
pass. That duty, however, appears to me to call particularly on all the ministers of the gospel, to look more to the Author and Finisher of our faith than to the expositors of 
it ; and, disregarding the doubtful and mysterious doctrines by which the latter have divided Christians from Christians, 
to unite in defending the plain and intelligible faith delivered to us by our Redeemer and his apostles. 
</p><p>
With great respect, and the best wishes for your health 
and happiness, 
</p><p>
I am, reverend sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
