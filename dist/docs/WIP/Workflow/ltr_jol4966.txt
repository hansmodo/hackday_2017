My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
I have received your kind favour of the 17th inst. 
</p><p>
The information which you give me relative to my 
hospitable acquaintance, gives me great pain. I had 
conceived an esteem for him, and it afflicts me to find 
a new instance of the depravity of my species. 
</p><p>
I am sorry that Kinloch did not return to America sooner. His former sentiments on the present con 
test, give reason to suspect, if he is a convert, that 
success on our side has alone operated the change. 
Something may be drawn in palliation of his conduct 
from the education he received, and the powerful influence which his guardian had over him. 
</p><p>
Beresford's circumstances were peculiar, he has been uniformly a friend to his country. 
</p><p>
The approach of the period which you allude to, 
occasions the greatest anxiety in my mind. The 
public interest and my own lead me to wish that you 
may continue in the august assembly of the states. 
I dread your being so remote from where my duty 
places me, and see collected in one view all the painful consequences of it. It was my intention at all 
events to have paid you the homage of my love in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, at the close of the present campaign. 
We are at present in a disagreeable state of suspense. 
Continued preparations in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> announce a very 
considerable embarkation. Our spies inform us that a council of war had been held, and continued for 
three days. Lord Howe has certainly arrived. Gen'l Gray's troops had returned by way of the sound and 
been relanded. Admiral Byron in the Princess Royal 
of 90 guns, accompanied by the Culloden, Capt. Balfour of 74, had arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, according to 
the Gazette of that place ; but I believe the truth was, 
that they only arrived off the Hook. They are since 
arrived at Newport where they are refitting. It is 
probable that the Princess Royal could not get into 
port at N. York, without taking out the greatest part 
of her artillery. Accounts from various quarters in 
form us, that Lord Howe is preparing for England, 
and that Admiral Byron will take the command. 
</p><p>
The arrival of the August packet will in all probability determine his operations. The sickly state of 
his crews, and the damage which his ships suffered in 
the storm, have rendered him inactive here till the 
opportunity is lost for the only enterprise which re 
mains for the enemy's combined land and naval force 
in America. 
</p><p>
Nothing remains for them, but to render the 
garrisons of <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=halifax' rel='city'>Halifax</a> respectable (at 
the latter place, the seventieth regiment, the Duke 
of Hamilton's and the Duke of Argyle's highland 
men, according to the N. York paper, have arrived), 
to evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and Rhode Island, and 
withdraw the flower of the whole British infantry, 
which in their present situation are useless as to the 
general operations of the war. The French have 
more troops in the West India islands, than are necessary for a mere defensive plan. Their magazines are 
well furnished; the British 011 their parts are weak 
in both these respects in that quarter, and I am convinced that the slightest demonstration there, would 
occasion the immediate removal of General Clinton's 
army. Some think that the British will keep possession of N. York and Rhode Island, to enable them to 
make better terms. 
</p><p>
There is field for conjecture; the British may at 
this moment be attempting a negotiation with France. 
It can be neither her interest nor inclination to sacrifice her ally ; a general peace in this case would be 
the consequence. But accident or the caprice of a 
minister may disappoint the most rational predictions, 
and give rise to events which, at present, appear the 
most improbable. 
</p><p>
An unlucky affray has happened at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> which 
gives us the deepest concern. We are not acquainted 
with particulars any farther than that a quarrel arose 
between some American and French sailors. They 
proceeded from harsh words to more dangerous blows. 
Two valuable French officers who attempted to quell 
the riot were much abused, and one of them, the 
Count de's Sauveur it is feared will not recover. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> informs us that the matter has been 
generally traced and found to originate with the Convention troops. The sailors who were the immediate 
</p><p>
instruments were Britons in the privateer service. If this is not strictly true, it is a story which policy w'd encourage. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>Gen'l Greene</a> in his first letter on the subject informs us that the French officers seemed satisfied that the 
mischief had been planned by some artful hand in Burgoyne's army, but he since tells us that there are jealousies on the subject. 
</p><p>
I saw very plainly when I was at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that our antient hereditary prejudices were very far from being eradicated. 
</p><p>
A sergeant major who deserted from the 2 d batallion 
of Highlanders gives Gen'l Scott the following intelligence. That the 1'st and 2 d British brigade had 
received orders to hold themselves in readiness for 
embarking for the "W". Indies ; that the transports are 
lying in readiness to take them on board; he has 
heard officers say that <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is to be evacuated. 
Another deserter asserts that four regiments are 
already embarked, and that the horse transports as 
well as others are ordered to prepare for sea. 
</p><p>
I omitted to mention to you that Lord Howe was 
on board a frigate during the whole time that Count D'Estaing gave him chase. This is a privilege allowed to admirals for their personal security, and is 
analagous to a general's placing himself on a safe eminence to view an engagement, but it could only be used 
in a desperate case, and by a man of Lord Howe's established reputation. 
For want of time to arrange my ideas, I have written you a chaos of intelligence, which I fear you. will hardly be able to reduce to any kind of order. 
</p><p>
You will not, I hope, quit <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> immediately 
after the first of next month. A few days more must 
develop the enemy's intentions, and may give me an 
opportunity of obtaining a furlough, at a time when it 
will not be dishonourable to take one. The campaign 
in all probability will terminate very insipidly, by the 
evacuation of N. York and Rhode Island, and I shall 
have time enough to rejoin the army for the Canadian 
expedition if it should take place. 
</p><p>
Anticipating the happiness which I shall enjoy in 
embracing you, I commend myself to your love, and 
my dear father to God's protection. 
</p><p>

Gen'l Scott informs us that a party of the enemy have advanced on this side Kingsbridge. Another 
party have landed at Paulus Hook and advanced beyond Bergen. From the description, they are strong 
foraging parties, and design to glean the county previous to taking leave. Our General has given 
orders to parry any stroke which they may meditate against our posts in the highlands, tho the 
possibility of such an enterprise is exceedingly remote, and their dispositions in this case would be void of common sense.
