Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am not sure that the new government will be found to 
rest on principles sufficiently stable to produce a uniform 
adherence to what justice, dignity, and liberal policy may 
require ; for however proper such conduct may be, none 
but great minds will always deem it expedient. Men in 
general are guided more by conveniences than by principles ; this idea accompanies all my reflections on the new 
constitution, and induced me to remark to our late Convention at <a href='/results.php?city=poughkeepsie' rel='city'>Poughkeepsie</a>, that some of the most unpopular and 
strong parts of it appeared to me to be the most unexceptionable. Government without liberty is a curse ; but 
on the other hand, liberty without government is far from 
being a blessing. 
</p><p>
The opponents in this State to the constitution decrease 
and grow temperate. Many of them seem to look forward 
to another Convention, rather as a measure that will justify 
their opposition, than produce all the effects they pretended 
to expect from it. I wish that measure may be adopted 
with a good grace, and without delay or hesitation. So 
many good reasons can be assigned for postponing the 
session of such a Convention for three or four years, that I 
really believe the great majority of its advocates would be 
satisfied with that delay ; after which I think we should not 
have much danger to apprehend from it, especially if the 
new government should in the mean time recommend itself 
to the people by the wisdom of their proceedings, which I 
flatter myself will be the case. The division of the 
powers of government into three departments, is a great 
and valuable point gained, and will give the people the best 
opportunity of bringing the question whether they can 
govern themselves to a decision in their favour. 
</p><p>
I remain, dear sir, 
Your faithful friend and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
