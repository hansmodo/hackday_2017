</p><p>
I HAVE received a good deal of paper from you. I 
wish it had been more covered ; the writing is very 
scant, yet I must not grumble. I know your time is 
not yours nor mine. Your labors must be great and 
your mouth closed ; but all you may communicate, I 
beg you would. There is a pleasure, I know not 
whence it arises, nor can I stop now to find it out, 
but I say there is a degree of pleasure in being able 
to tell news, especially any that so nearly concerns 
us, as all your proceedings do. 
</p><p>
I should have been more particular, but I thought 
you knew every thing that passed here. The present state of the inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> is that of the 
most abject slaves, under the most cruel and despotic 
of tyrants. Among many instances I could mention, let me relate one- Upon the 17th of June, 
printed handbills were posted up at the corners of 
the streets and upon houses, forbidding any inhabit 
ants to go upon their houses, or upon any eminence, 
on pain of death ; the inhabitants dared not to look 
out of their houses, nor to be heard or seen to ask 
a question. Our prisoners were brought over to the 
Long Wharf, and there lay all night, without any 
care of their wounds or any resting-place but the 
pavements, until the next day, when they exchanged 
it for the jail, since which we hear they are civilly 
treated. Their living cannot be good, as they can 
have no fresh provisions ; their beef, we hear, is all 
gone, and their own wounded men die very fast, so 
that they have a report that the bullets were poison 
ed. Fish they cannot have, they have rendered it 
so difficult to procure ; and the admiral is such a 
villain as to oblige every fishing schooner to pay a 
dollar every time it goes out. The money that has 
been paid for passes is incredible. Some have given 
ten, twenty, thirty, and forty dollars, to get out with a small proportion of their things. It is reported 
and believed, that they have taken up a number of 
persons and committed them to jail, we know not for 
what in particular. Master Lovell is confined in the 
dungeon ; a son of Mr. Edes is in jail, and one Wiburt, a ship carpenter, is now upon trial for his life. 
God alone knows to what length these wretches will 
go, and will I hope restrain their malice. 
</p><p>
I would not have you be distressed about me. 
Danger, they say, makes people valiant. Hitherto 
I have been distressed, but not dismayed. I have 
felt for my country and her sons, and have bled 
with them and for them. Not all the havoc and 
devastation they have made, has wounded me like 
the death of Warren. We want him in the Senate ; 
we want him in his profession ; we want him in the 
field. We mourn for the citizen, the senator, the 
physician, and the warrior. May we have others 
raised up in his room.

I have had a very kind and friendly visit from our dear friends Colonel Warren, lady, and son. Mrs. Warren spent almost a week with me, and he came 
and met her here, and kept Sabbath with me. I suppose she will write to you, though she says you are in her debt.

You scarcely make mention of <a href="/results.php?tla=ben" rel="met acquaintance">Dr. Franklin</a>. 
Surely he must be a valuable member. Pray, what is become of your Judas,  I see he is not with 
you upon the list of delegates. I wish I could come 
and see you. I never suffer myself to think you are 
about returning soon. Can it, will it be? May I 
ask may I wish for it? When once I expect you, 
the time will crawl till I see you. But hush ! Do 
you know it is eleven o'clock at night? We have 
had some very fine rains since I wrote you last. I 
hope we shall not now have famine added to war. 
Grain, grain is what we want here. Meat we have 
enough, and to spare. Pray don t let Bass forget my 
pins. Hardwick has applied to me for Mr. Bass to 
get him a hundred of needles, number six, to carry 
on his stocking weaving. We shall very soon have 
no coffee, nor sugar, nor pepper here ; but whortleberries and milk we are not obliged to commerce 
for. Good night. With thoughts of thee do I close 
my eyes. Angels guard and protect thee ; and may 
a safe return ere long bless thy
