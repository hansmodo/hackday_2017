Sir, 
</p><p>
I return your Excellency many thanks for your 
polite letter, accompanying the resolution of Congress, 
complimenting me with a couple of cannon. I am \ 
not very certain where those cannon^ are, but I believe two are in Virginia, and three in South Carolina; and it is no less difficult for me to determine 
where I would wish those sent which are made choice 
of for me. If those in South Carolina should be fixed 
upon, I would wish them to remain in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
But if those in Virginia should be appropriated for 
this purpose, if agreeable, let them be sent to Newport. Should any thing happefi before this business 
is executed, which should enable me to be more explicit on the subject, I shall take the earliest opportunity of signifying to your Excellency my further 
wishes in the matter. I am, with the highest respect, 
and greatest esteem. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=nag" rel="me">Nathanael Greene</a>.
