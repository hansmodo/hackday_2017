DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have not taken the liberty of giving you any 
trouble for some time past; and, indeed, I never do 
it but with great reluctance, because I know how 
much your attention and time must be engaged in 
the most important pursuits. 
</p><p>
The bearer of this, the Marquis Armand de la Rouerie, is entitled to my warmest recommendations, 
because he brought from his own country letters to 
me that I am obliged to attend to, and put great 
faith in, as they come from persons worthy of the 
utmost credit. One of them is from Mr. Deane, who 
not only mentions him as a gentleman of rank., good 
family, and fortune, but also as a man of great merit ; desiring my particular attention to him, and that 
I should supply him with money, which will be repaid in France by a gentleman to whom America 
is under the most important obligations. You will, 
therefore, excuse and oblige me at the same time by 
your favorable attention to Monsieur Armand, for he 
chooses to pass by that name ; and, should he want 
money, I will pay his drafts for what he stands in 
need of. I find he is a little disgusted at an appointment made for him by Congress this day; and 
I believe it was through the inattention of a committee, which I shall get set right again in a short 
time. I am, dear Sir, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 
</p><p>
Your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
