MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE Senate were obliged to spend the whole of the 
last week, in a solemn trial of the election of Mr. Gallatin, and I find that a great impression has been 
made upon the public by the learning, eloquence, 
and reasoning of some of the senators. The decision has given general satisfaction. That popularity was more courted than truth by a few individuals, I fear will be the judgment of some of the most 
enlightened and independent spectators.

I have again been unfortunate at sea. The vessel 
in which I shipped my grass seeds and two barrels of 
rye flour for you, has been run down and sunk in the 
river by a large ship. Most of the cargo was saved, 
but whether my adventure was saved or lost, I have 
not yet learned. The weather to-day has been very 
warm, and the snow, which generally covered the 
earth this morning, is, I presume, nearly gone. The 
spring will advance with rapid strides, and I shall 
be impatient to be at home ; but I cannot prevail 
upon myself to ask leave of absence from my post 
at this critical time, when we know not what questions or events a day may bring forth. 
</p><p>
The new French minister, M. Fauchet, is about 
thirty-three. He is not quite so unreserved as his 
predecessor, but he seems to me to be in great distress. He was received by the galleries in the theatre with three cheers, but the people have not ad 
dressed him or made much noise about him. At the 
birth-night ball he was placed by the managers on 
the right hand of the President, which gave great of 
fence to the Spanish commissioners ; and it is said 
Mr. Hammond has left the theatre, offended or dis 
gusted at some partial popular distinctions there. My 
melancholy anxiety for my mother prevents me from 
visiting theatres and assemblies, so that I know no 
thing but by hearsay. 
</p><p>
The discussions of last week kept me five or six 
hours a day in so close a confinement, and the crowd 
of hearers injured the air so, that I was almost sick ; 
but a day or two of rest has relieved me in some degree. I long for my home, but that is not to be my 
felicity for some time. 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
