MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RECEIVED yesterday your kind favor of the 1st of 
this month, and thank you for its agreeable contents. 
I have now to congratulate you on the arrival of your 
son and daughter and two grandsons, in fine health, at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. They have done wisely to fly from the evil 
to come in Europe ; although it is somewhat dubious 
whether our fellow citizens will have the wisdom to 
abstain from similar evils in this country. My friend 
Malesherbes is about to crown the end of his life with 
greater glory than he gained in his youth or middle 
age, though this was splendid. Such a character as 
that great magistrate ought to wish to die on so great 
a theatre in defence of his prince, and struggling 
against the disgrace which enthusiasm is about to 
bring upon the nation. 
</p><p>
The spirit of ambition and of conquest, which the 
French republic in its cradle has already discovered, 
has alarmed England and Holland. France has been 
execrated in Europe for their ambition for universal 
monarchy ; but the passion was imputed to their kings, 
Henry 4th and Louis 14th. But the people are already 
giving unequivocal proofs of an equal lust after a 
universal republic. The passion is, and always has 
been, in the people, the nation, and their leaders will 
ever be infected with it, whether they call them 
kings, or presidents, or citizens. I can only sigh at 
the prospect of calamities opening on the human race 
and pray God to avert them. 
</p><p>
We have to-day a deep snow, which I hope will 
last till I can reach <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a> in a sleigh and there enjoy a felicity, which will never be allowed me any 
where else. 
</p><p>
Tenderly yours, 
</p><p>
