29 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
NOT since the 5th of September, have I had one line from you, which makes me very uneasy. Are you 
all this time conferring with his Lordship? Is there no communication? or, are the post-riders all dismissed? Let the cause be what it will, not hearing 
from you has given me much uneasiness.

We seem to be kept in total ignorance of affairs at York. I hope you at Congress are more enlightened. Who fell, who are wounded, who prisoners or their number, is as undetermined as it was the day 
after the battle. If our army is in ever so critical a state I wish to know it, and the worst of it. If all 
America is to be ruined and undone by a pack of cowards and knaves, I wish to know it. Pitiable is 
the lot of their commander. Caesar's tenth legion never was forgiven. We are told for truth, that a 
regiment of Yorkers refused to quit the city ; and, that another regiment behaved like a pack of cowardly villains by quitting their posts. If they are unjustly censured, it is for want of proper intelligence.

I am sorry to see a spirit so venal prevailing every where. When our men were drawn out for Canada, 
a very large bounty was given them ; and now another call is made upon us ; no one will go without 
a large bounty, though only for two months, and each town seems to think its honor engaged in outbidding 
the others. The province pay is forty shillings. In addition to that, this town voted to make it up six 
pounds. They then drew out the persons most unlikely to go, and they are obliged to give three 
pounds to hire a man. Some pay the whole fine, ten pounds. Forty men are now drafted from this 
town. More than one half, from sixteen to fifty, are now in the service. This method of conducting 
will create a general uneasiness in the Continental army. I hardly think you can be sensible how much we are thinned in this province. 
</p><p>
The rage for privateering is as great here as any where. Vast numbers are employed in that way. 
If it is necessary to make any more drafts upon us, the women must reap the harvests. I am willing to do my part. I believe I could gather corn, and 
husk it ; but I should make a poor figure at digging potatoes. 
</p><p>
There has been a report, that a fleet was seen in our bay yesterday. I cannot conceive from whence, nor do I believe the story. 
</p><p>
Tis said you have been upon Staten Island to hold your conference. Tis a little odd, that I have 
never received the least intimation of it from you. Did you think I should be alarmed? Don't you know me better than to think me a coward? I hope 
you will write me every thing concerning this affair. I have a great curiosity to know the result. 
</p><p>
As to government, nothing is yet done about it. The Church is opened here every Sunday, and the King prayed for, as usual, in open defiance of Congress. 
</p><p>
If the next post does not bring me a letter, I think I will leave off writing, for I shall not believe you get mine. 
</p><p>
Adieu. Yours, .
