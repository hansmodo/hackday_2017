MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I SHALL enclose with this some letters between Randolph and Hammond, which will show you how quarrelsome they are. Poor fellows ! They both desire 
peace, but think themselves obliged to wrangle 
for their countries. It is fashionable to charge wars 
upon kings, but I think " le peuple souverain" is as 
inflammable and as proud, and at the same time less 
systematic, uniform, and united, so that it is not easy 
for them to avoid wars. We have labored very hard 
to preserve our tranquillity, but the peuple souverain 
is continually committing some intemperance or in 
discretion or other, tending to defeat all our precautions. If we are involved in a war, my head, heart 
and hands shall be guiltless of the crime of provoking it. But it will be my duty to submit to the legal 
voice and decree of my country. 
</p><p>
We have fine rains here for three days past, and I 
hope you enjoy a similar blessing. I shall take leave 
on Saturday, 31st of May, but cannot hope to get 
home before the 10th or 12th of June. The journey 
lies before me like a mountain. I am too old and too 
feeble for these long journeys, dry sessions, and un 
comfortable scenes. I am at an age when I ought to 
be at home with my family. 
I wish you an agreeable election. Who will be 
Lieutenant Governor, Gill or Gerry ? I wrote to Dr. 
Willard, sometime ago, a resignation of the chair of 
the Academy of Arts and Sciences. It would be a 
farce for rne to hold it any longer. My duty to my 
mother. Tell my brother that I suppose he was for 
war to make himself popular ; but I am very sorry to 
find that warlike sentiments are popular in <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>. 
I am glad he is chosen, however, and hope he will 
get our town back to the county of Suffolk. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest friend, adieu.
