DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is with the utmost reluctance I now sit down 
to inform you that the enemy, after making a variety of movements up and down the North River, landed, on the morning of the 4th instant, about three 
thousand men, at Tarrytown; and, after making an 
excursion about five miles up the country, they returned and embarked. The morning following they 
advanced up near King's Ferry, and landed on the 
east side of the river ; but in the evening part of 
them reembarked, and, the morning after, landed a 
little above King's Ferry, on the west side ; but the 
morning being so exceeding foggy concealed their 
scheme, and prevented us from gaining any idea what 
number of troops they landed. In about three hours 
we discovered a large fire at the Ferry, which we 
imagined to be the store-houses, upon which it was 
thought they only landed with a view of destroying 
the said houses. 
</p><p>
The picket and scouts, which we had out, could not 
learn the exact number of the enemy that were remaining on the east side of the river; but, from the best accounts, they were about fifteen hundred. At 
this same time a number of ships, galleys, &c., with about forty flat-bottomed boats, made every appearance of their intentions to land troops, both at Fort 
Independence and <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> Landing. Under all these circumstances, my strength, being not more than twelve hundred Continental troops and three hundred 
militia, prevented me from detaching off a party to attack the enemy that lay on the east side of the river. After we had thought it impracticable to quit 
the heights, which we had then possession of, and attack the enemy, Brigadier-General Parsons and myself went to reconnoitre the ground near the enemy, 
and, on our return from thence, we were alarmed with a very heavy and hot firing, both of small arms and cannon, at Fort Montgomery, which immediately 
convinced me that the enemy had landed a large body of men at the time and place before-mentioned. Upon which, I immediately detached off five hundred 
men to reenforce the garrison. But before they could 
possibly cross the river to their assistance, the enemy, who were far superior in numbers, had possessed 
themselves of the fort. Never did men behave with 
more spirit and alacrity than our troops upon this occasion. They repulsed the enemy three times, which 
were in number at least five to one. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> and General James Clinton were both present; 
but the engagement continuing until the dusk of the 
evening, gave them both an opportunity, together with 
several officers and a number of privates, to make 
their escape. 
</p><p>
The loss of the enemy in this affair, Governor 
Clinton thinks must be very considerable. Our loss, 
killed and wounded, is by no means equal to what 
he might have expected. General James Clinton was 
wounded in the thigh, but I hope not mortally. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> the same evening, 
about eleven o clock; and, with the advice of him, 
General Parsons, and several other officers, it was 
thought impossible to maintain the post at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> 
with the force then present, against one that the 
enemy might, in a few hours, bring on the heights 
in our rear. It was, therefore, agreed that the stores 
ought to be immediately removed to some secure 
place, and the troops take post at <a href='/results.php?city=fishkill' rel='city'>Fishkill</a>, until a 
reinforcement of militia should come to their aid. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly informed your Excellency of the 
enemy's design against this post ; but, from some motive or other, you always differed with me in opinion. 
As this conjecture of mine has, for once, proved right, 
I cannot omit informing you that my real and sincere opinion is, that they now mean to join General 
Burgoyne, with the utmost despatch. I have written 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>, and informed him of the situation of 
our affairs in this quarter. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> is Exerting himself in collecting the militia of this State. 
Brigadier-General Parsons I have sent off to forward 
in the Connecticut militia, which are now arriving in 
great numbers. I therefore hope and trust that, in 
the course of a few days, I shall be able to oppose 
the progress of the enemy. Time will not permit me 
to add any thing more respecting the engagement, 
only that our loss (I believe, from the best information,) does not exceed two hundred and fifty, killed, 
wounded, and taken prisoners. This evening I in 
tend writing you again, but am now very busy. I 
am, dear General, with sincere regard, 
</p><p>
Your very obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
