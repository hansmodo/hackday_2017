SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's public and private letters, of the 
26th, were handed me day before yesterday, and I 
wish it had been in my power to have given them 
an earlier answer; but the difficulty of satisfying 
myself, in all the matters contained in your letter, 
has prevented it. 
</p><p>
Many people are apprehensive for the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> ; and I think it in jeopardy, as well as the troops 
under <a href="/results.php?tla=bel" rel="me">Lincoln's</a> command. I am more anxious for the 
fate of the troops than the city. Should they both 
fall together, in this critical stage of our finance, it is 
difficult to determine what will be the consequences. 
Most people seem to agree, that a further detachment of troops from this army cannot add any safety 
to the city, as its fall must be decided long before 
the troops can get up. Governor Reed, Generals 
Schuyler, Scott, and Wayne, are all of this opinion, 
as well as Mr. Sherman, and the Massachusetts Delegates; and this is clearly my opinion. But Colonel Grayson, and, I believe, the Board of War in general, 
are of opinion that a detachment ought to be sent 
on immediately, as they are apprehensive the city will 
fall, and the enemy push on to the northward. 
Should this happen, a proper force can be detached 
seasonably hereafter, as it cannot make but a few 
days difference whether they march now, or when 
the fall of the city shall be decided. If the enemy 
are defeated, the detachment ought not to go; and 
if they are not, it is already too late to give timely 
succour to the place. 
</p><p>
The business of finance is yet a matter of mere 
speculation. Nothing can be determined upon it from 
the present appearances. Most people are silent 
upon the subject; and this I interpret into a favorable symptom. I find the measure passed in Congress 
but by a majority of one, and the members are more 
split and divided about the matter now, than any 
other order of men; indeed, some of them reprobate 
the measure. I perfectly agree with your Excellency 
in sentiment, that it is the duty of every well-wisher 
to the cause to give all the support in his power to 
the plan, now it is taken. For the measure will en 
tail just as much disgrace upon us if it does not proceed, as if if does ; and, if the plan fails, I am at a 
loss to conceive how we are to support the war. 
Public and private credit is almost at an end. 
</p><p>
Nothing is done in the Quarter-master's department. The new system I mentioned in my last, is 
yet undecided on. The more I view it, the less I 
like it, and the stronger my conviction is, that it is 
calculated not less to embarrass your Excellency than 
to disgrace and injure me. Mifflin and Pickering are 
gone to Reading; and Mifflin has got the Massachusetts Delegates into his house, in town, upon 
very moderate terms, and, it is said, with a view of 
strengthening himself in that quarter. Depend upon 
it, he has a scheme, in concert with others. 
</p><p>
Public business is in a wretched train. All things 
at a stand ; and I don t believe the great departments of the army will be organized for a month to 
come, unless the new system is adopted, which will 
starve and disband the army in half the time. 
</p><p>
Generals Schuyler and Scott think it a most pal 
try thing. What I had in contemplation as a system, I am persuaded is the only plan which will 
yield proper support to the army, and cooperate with 
your Excellency's military manoeuvres. An army is 
viewed in Congress as a city, which may be supported and provided for, without regarding the emergencies of service. That body seem to be insensible of 
the great difference there is, in their public estimation, betwixt now and four years ago, not only among 
individuals, but with the States in general; and, in 
stead of strengthening their influence by a just and 
generous conduct to individuals, they add insult to 
injury. A political body, that acts upon such barbarous maxims of policy, cannot fail to bring ruin and 
distress upon the people, as no honest man, that has a regard for his reputation, would feel himself in the 
power of such people. Conscious of my own integrity, as well as faithful attention to the business committed to my trust, I cannot help feeling an honest 
indignation at the little arts made use of to lessen 
my merit and create suspicions to my prejudice. As 
I was placed in the office I now hold by your Excellency's particular request, and as you are the only 
person who can do me ample justice, I flatter myself 
I may safely rest my reputation with you, to place 
me in that point of light which justice and equity 
demand. 
</p><p>
It is the wish of many here, that your Excellency 
should come to town; and, I am persuaded, you 
would have it in your power to settle and arrange 
many matters, which, for want of being done, every 
thing is in a train the most ruinous and distressing 
imaginable. All our public horses in this State are 
starving. Hundreds have been drove into this city 
from the country, because the people refuse to keep 
them any longer. From the distressed situation the 
Forage department is in, I am afraid the most of our horses, if not all, will be altogether unfit for opening the campaign. After this day, we shall not have 
an ounce of forage in this city. This, I must confess, would not grieve me much, were we well provided elsewhere ; but, alas ! we are in just the same 
wretched situation in every quarter. People may 
sometimes be convinced by feeling, when they cannot 
by reasoning. 
</p><p>
I am very apprehensive we shall lose a great part 
of the articles we have manufacturing, as the people 
will not deliver them without payment. What grieves 
me most, is the loss of several hundred fine new 
wagons, which were in great forwardness, and on 
which we depended for the opening campaign. 
</p><p>
There is no arrival, or foreign news. We learn 
here, by the way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that Clinton was to 
attack <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> on the 15th of this month. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the information respecting Mrs. Greene, and desire my compliments to 
Mrs. Washington. With great respect, I am, 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
