GENTLEMEN : 
</p><p>
Your letter of resignation of this day contains an accusation no less 
indelicate than unjust. You say, my orders contain such injustice, and 
are so repugnant to your feelings, that you cannot consistent with your 
established rights serve me any longer. I am not conscious of having 
done you injustice I am sure I never intended it. You arrogate the 
sole right of judging and deciding upon privileges claimed but not 
authorised. You do not distinguish between what has been matter of indulgence and what are rights inherent from the constitution of your 
corps. I will not take upon myself to say positively that I have not 
invaded the privileges of your corps ; but I am so fully persuaded of the 
propriety of my conduct upon the strictest military principles that I am 
perfectly willing to submit it to our superiors in Congress the Board 
of War the Commander-in-chief, or either of them. I have always 
conceived some privileges were intended your corps, not in common 
with the rest of the cavalry; but in that I may be mistaken. The late 
referrence to the Board of War will decide. I can see no necessity for 
the extraordinary step you are taking ; if you think yourselves injured 
in matters of right and not of indulgence, represent the affair to Congress. Enclose a copy of my orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, and let 
him bring the business to an explanation. If their decision corresponds with your sentiments, I shall be happy to confess my error. I 
am sure I have not a wish in my heart to retrench one privilege of the 
Legion, nor am I disposed to wantonly sport with the feelings of 
officers. But it is not in my power always to accommodate the service 
to the views of particular officers. Every person can judge of their 
own difficulties, but it is impossible to judge fairly for others without a 
collective view of all the circumstances. This you cannot have in the 
present case or I am persuaded you would not decide so hastily. The 
measure you are about to take may involve some disagreeable consequences to yourselves perhaps to me. The world will judge of the 
propriety of your conduct not according to your way of thinking, but 
from the original principles of the matter in dispute ; and I leave 
you to consider how unwarrantable a combination of this sort will 
appear in the critical situation of the Southern States, and how in 
consistent with the character and dignity of your corps and the duty 
and obligation you owe to your country, and to the cause in which 
you are engaged. I readily confess you may have it in your power to 
hurt me as an individual, but let not little resentments plunge you into 
measures injurious to the public and unjust to yourselves. I am persuaded upon a fair investigation of the matter and by reasoning more 
fully on the subject, you will be convinced that I have acted perfectly 
consistent with the duties of my station, with the established customs of 
armies and consonant to the rights of your corps. But be that as it 
may, let it be decided by those in power, whose determination shall 
govern my conduct; and to convince you that I am by no means disposed to do the least injury to your rights you shall see all I write both 
to Congress and Lieut. -Colonel Lee. If I am mistaken Congress will 
correct me ; but if you are wrong, I presume you will have generosity 
enough to acknowledge it ; and I am persuaded you will have the spirit 
of patriotism sufficient to continue your services to your country. I 
will add only one more observation and close this long and disagreeable 
letter. I have never known but very few officers leave the service in 
the progress of this war, but have repented of it. Combinations are 
always odious, and no character, however important, or set of men, how 
ever useful, can produce any great revolution in so great a cause. Let 
not secret insinuations mislead you, nor be so idle as others have been 
to think the public cannot do without you. I know your value and 
shall feel your loss, and wish you to reconsider the matter before you 
take your final resolution. 
</p><p>
I am, gentlemen, with great respect, 
</p><p>
your most obedient humble servant,
