Sir, 
</p><p>
I pray your Excellency to remind the Congress, that I still wait to receive their orders, and though I am sensible 
that they have many and important affairs under their consideration, yet I must entreat them to reflect on the peculiar 
situation I have for some time past been placed in, and inform me if they desire my further attendance. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your 
</p><p>
Excellency's, Sec.
