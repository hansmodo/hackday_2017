DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you via <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and have little to add, except to 
acquaint you that some changes have taken place since my 
last, which have not the most promising aspect for America, 
several of the Bedford party being come into employment 
again; a party that has distinguished itself by exclaiming 
against us on all late occasions. Mr. Conway, one of our 
friends, has resigned, and Lord Weymouth takes his place. 
Lord Shelburne, another friend, is stripped of the American 
part of the business of his office, which now makes a distinct 
department, in which Lord Hillsborough is placed. I do not 
think this nobleman in general an enemy to America; but 
in the affair of paper money he was last winter strongly 
against us. 
</p><p>
I did hope I had removed some of his prejudices on that 
head, but am not certain. We have however increased the 
cry for it here, and believe shall attempt to obtain the repeal 
of the act, though the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette and their resolutions 
about manufactures have hurt us much, having occasioned an 
immense clamour here. I have endeavoured to palliate 
matters for them as well as I can, and hope with some success. 
For having, in a large company in which were some members 
of Parliament, given satisfaction to all, by what I alleged in 
explanation of the conduct of the Americans, and to show 
that they were not quite so unreasonable as they appeared to 
be, I was advised by several present to make my sentiments 
public, not only for the sake of America, but as it would be 
some ease to our friends here, who are triumphed over a 
good deal by our adversaries on the occasion. I have accordingly done it in the inclosed paper. 
</p><p>
I shall write you fully on other subjects very soon. At 
present, I can only add my respects to the Committee, and 
that I am, dear Sir, your faithful humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

SIR 
</p><p>
I sent you sometime since, directed to the Care of M. 
Molini, a Bookseller near the Quay des Augustins a Tooth 
that I mentioned to you when I had the Pleasure of meeting 
with you at the Marquis de Courtanvaux's. It was found 
near the River Ohio in America, about 200 Leagues below 
Fort du Quesne, at what is called the Great Licking Place, 
where the Earth has a Saltish Taste that is agreable to the 
Buffaloes & Deer, who come there at certain Seasons in 
great Numbers to lick the same. At this Place have been 
found the Skeletons of near 30 large Animals supposed to be 
Elephants, several Tusks like those of Elephants, being 
found with these Grinder Teeth Four of these Grinders 
were sent me by the Gentleman 8 who brought them from the 
Ohio to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, together with 4 Tusks, one of which is 6 
Feet long & in the thickest Part near 6 Inches Diameter, 
and also one of the Vertebrae My Lord Shelbourn receiv'd 
at the same time 3 or four of them with a Jaw Bone & one 
or two Grinders remaining in it. Some of Our Naturalists 
here, however, contend, that these are not the Grinders of 
Elephants but of some carnivorous Animal unknown, because such Knobs or Prominences on the Face of the Tooth 
are not to be found on those of Elephants, and only, as they 
say, on those of carnivorous Animals. But it appears to 
me that Animals capable of carrying such large & heavy 
Tusks, must themselves be large Creatures, too bulky to 
have the Activity necessary for pursuing and taking Prey; 
and therefore I am inclin'd to think those Knobs are only a 
small Variety, Animals of the same kind and Name often 
differing more materially, and that those Knobs might be as 
useful to grind the small branches of Trees, as to chaw 
Flesh However I should be glad to have your Opinion, 
and to know from you whether any of the kind have been 
found in Siberia. 
</p><p>
With great Esteem & Respect, I am 
Sir 
</p><p>
Your most obed' hum 
</p><p>
Servant
