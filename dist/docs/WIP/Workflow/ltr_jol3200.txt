SIR, 
</p><p>
I had the honor of writing to your Excellency from 
<a href='/results.php?city=lebanon' rel='city'>Lebanon</a> the 23d instant. The day following, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. As 
soon as I had delivered to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> your Excellency's despatches and instructions, I set out for 
this place with Colonel Wall, and an ample number 
of pilots, whom <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> had provided and 
put under his command. Colonel Wall is a man of 
character and property, perfectly acquainted with the 
coast, &c. Those under him are experienced pilots, 
and men of responsibility. We arrived here at nine o'clock this morning, having been detained till that 
time in procuring a party of militia, and making arrangements both for securing such boats as we shall 
want for our own immediate use, and such as, with 
out this precaution, might be employed in communicating intelligence to the enemy. 
</p><p>
We have agreed with four whaleboat privateers, 
belonging to Connecticut, manned with enterprising, 
experienced mariners, and pressed four belonging to 
this State. We have given them to understand that 
the frigate, lying at Connecticut River, is to push 
out of the Sound, and that we are to meet her with 
hands to enable her to go round and join the French 
fleet, for which purpose their boats are necessary. 
The number that we have is amply sufficient for our business, and now we are in readiness. Two sentinels will be posted, in an advantageous place, whose 
business will be to attend to whatever signals may 
be given from the seaboard ; besides which, Colonel 
Wall, the master pilots, and myself, will alternately 
hold watch, arid keep our attention awake. Till last 
night, twelve o clock, unfavorable winds have prevailed. If the gale, which we have at present, does 
not prove inconstant, it will not be long before we 
are called upon. Our situation commands a view of 
the several entrances to <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>; and Block Island 
is directly opposite to us, so that nothing can pass 
to or from <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a> unnoticed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> estimates the enemy's land force 
here at seven thousand. The state of their shipping, 
he informs me, is as follows ; in the east channel 
(or that between Seconet Point and Rhode Island), 
two galleys and one small frigate ; in the west channel (or that between <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Neck and Connanicut 
Island), two small frigates ; in the middle, or main 
channel, two frigates ; at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>, two or three frigates. As <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> will probably write to 
your Excellency, I forbear descending to farther particulars. He has been indefatigable, and nothing on 
his part will be wanting. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
