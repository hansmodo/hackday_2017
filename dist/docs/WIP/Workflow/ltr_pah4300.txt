Dear Sir,
</p><p>
The honor you are pleased to do me in your favor 
of the 27th ultimo, desiring my opinion, in a friendly 
way, on the subject of the act for vesting the shares 
in the Potomac and James River navigation, is very 
flattering to me. And I should ill deserve the confidence you are pleased to place in me, if I should 
forbear to give you my unreserved sentiments on it. 
I will freely own to you, that I am embarrassed to 
reconcile the law, taken in its full extent, with the 
declarations you mention, and a fixed purpose of refusing pecuniary rewards. If this was the sole object 
of the act, I should not hesitate to dissent to its propriety. The United States seem most properly constituted to take into consideration a matter of that 
nature, for a variety of reasons, which I need not 
enumerate. But the preamble of the law, compared 
with a few facts that preceded the enacting of it, 
will present it in a view different from that of rewarding past military services. The facts I allude to 
are these. 
</p><p>
The great business of opening the navigation of 
Potomac and James River, and connecting it with 
that of the western waters, was taken up by you, and 
pressed with that earnestness so interesting a matter deserved. The difficulties, which nature had interposed, were increased by a combination of interests, 
hard to develop and explain, and still harder to reconcile. To all these was added another impediment 
arising from the scarcity of money, and the exhausted condition of the country. The time, however, was 
critical, and your observations, sent to the Assembly, 
proved that it was good policy to encounter every 
obstacle, and begin the work. The patronage of it 
seemed naturally to devolve on you, Sir ; and the 
Assembly, desiring to give efficacy to that patronage, 
vested the shares in you. 
</p><p>
This navigation depends upon private subscription 
for success, so that, unless you had subscribed, you 
could not have been concerned. You will forgive me 
for supposing that your finances could not have made 
it desirable to risk a sum of money on the success 
of an enterprise like this. For your estate could not 
have been exempted from that loss in its produce, 
experienced by other gentlemen's estates throughout 
the country during the war. Considering, then, that 
your promoting this great affair necessarily obliged 
you to subscribe to it, and besides, to encounter all 
the difficulties arising from the nature of it, the 
variety of interests, views, and circumstances, which 
attended it, and that, in arranging and conducting all 
these, not only great labor and attention as well as 
abilities are requisite, but also expense of money and 
loss of time,  â€” it would seem at least that you ought 
to be secured against the chance of losing by subscribing. And this is all the law can be said to do, 
inasmuch as it must remain uncertain whether the 
shares are worth any thing, till the business is completed. If this never happens to be accomplished, 
your labor, time, &c., &c., are lost, and the donation 
proves an empty sound. 
</p><p>
Your acceptance of it will prevent that shock, 
which you justly observe will be given by a refusal; 
and I submit to your reflection, how for your resignation of the shares may throw a damp on that ardor 
which I have the pleasure to hear prevails at present 
to promote the undertaking. I must believe that at 
least a temporary check would be given to its progress, till the means of replacing so many shares 
could be found ; and I am really not able to find out 
the way to do it. Your acceptance will avoid this 
embarrassing circumstance. And if, after reviewing 
the whole matter, you shall think it inadmissible io 
hold the shares in the manner the law gives them, 
you will be at liberty to make such alteration in the 
interest, or disposition of the use, as shall be most 
agreeable to yourself. 
</p><p>
If I have exceeded in the freedom with which 1 
have treated this subject, I must entreat your forgiveness ; for I have no motive but to evince, on every 
occasion, that I am, with unalterable affection and the 
most sincere attachment. 
</p><p>
Dear Sir, your very obedient servant,

P. S. Two other large packets from Ireland .accompany this. The post could not carry them all at 
once. No other conveyance seems to present soon, 
and the Captain (Boyle) begs to receive your commands as soon as convenient.
