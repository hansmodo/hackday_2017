Dear <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague friend met'>Jay</a>, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 13th of October, from 
Paris. That part of it in cypher, (relating to Oswald's commission,) I have communicated only to <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague friend met'>Mr Morris</a> and Mr Livingston ; to them, and to them only, for reasons which 
will be obvious to you. Your letters to Congress, for 
such I call those you write the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
are what they ought to be, and have the effect you would 
wish. You should remember, however, that the back lands 
are as important in the eyes of some, as the fisheries are in 
those of others. Men are forgetful, and therefore it will be 
well by timely declarations of your sentiments to recall your 
conduct while in Congress. You and I differ about the western country, but you and your sovereign are of the same option. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague met'>General McDougall</a>, Colonel Brooks of the Massachusetts, 
and Colonel Ogden of the Jersey line, are now here, with a 
petition to Congress from the army for pay. The army are 
now disciplined, and their wants as to food and clothing are 
relieved, but they are not paid. Their back accounts are 
not settled. If settled, the balances are not secured by competent funds. No provision is made for the half-pay promised 
them. Some persons, and indeed some Slates, pretend to dispute their claim to it. The army have swords in their hands. 
You know enough of the history of mankind to know much 
more than I have said, and possibly much more than they 
themselves yet think of. I will add, however, that I am glad 
to sec things in their present train. Depend on it, good will 
arise from the situation to which we are hastening. And this 
you may rely on, that my efforts will not he wanting. I pledge 
myself to you on the present occasion, an I although I think it 
probable, that much of convulsion will ensue, yet it must terminate in giving to government that power, without which 
government is but a name. 
</p><p>
Accept my sincere wishes, that the year now commencing 
may prove to you and yours the kind dispenser of every 
human felicity. All your friends are well, and rejoice that you 
are in a situation so essential to America, as that which you 
now hold. Some persons have hinted to me, that you are too 
suspicious. I think they are much mistaken. The observation, if it proceeds from the heart, shows only that they are 
not so well acquainted will) human nature as you are. Go on, 
my good friend, continue to merit the esteem of all good men, 
and give to envy her favorite food. When you are tired of 
Europe, and have completed your business there, I will invits 
you, in the language of Sheastone,
