My dear General, 
</p><p>
This letter will be handed by Colonel Morris, who 
waits upon your Excellency with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s 
sentiments upon the different ways to improve Count de Grasse's assistance. I have been desired to add 
my own ; but the last letter I had the honor to write 
has anticipated the information which <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> 
wanted me to give. 
</p><p>
The light infantry are eight hundred and fifty ; the 
Pennsylvanians, about six hundred ; Virginia exchanged soldiers and new levies, four hundred ; the Marylanders will be six hundred. We have one hundred 
and twenty dragoons, and a chance to obtain sixty 
more. Had we accoutrements, we could have two 
hundred more, whom Colonel white has in readiness, with two hundred excellent horses, sixty of which I 
hope to equip by dismounting volunteers. As to 
militia, we may, in a few days, have three thousand. 
A demand from you upon the State of Maryland will 
procure one thousand well-armed militia. The conduct 
of some people in that State, appears to me very injurious to public interests. The new levies have been 
every day delayed, every petty pretence employed to 
prevent their joining either <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> or this 
army. The danger of <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, upon which I was 
not very hasty to quiet them, brought on a confession 
that the men were ready. I then demanded them, in 
most urgent terms. At last, I sent George there, who 
wrote me that they make a beautiful battalion. But 
he could not obtain more than a promise to send them in three or four days. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> is evacuated with some precipitation. 
I wait for a more particular account before I write 
officially. Yesterday, M. de Camus, a French officer 
of the navy, reconnoitred the shipping in York River. 
There are sixty sail, â€” ten of which, armed vessels; the 
largest, a fifty-gun ship ; their situation very much 
exposed. The enemy are not yet fortifying at York. 
What is doing at Gloucester is rather upon a contracted scale. They do not appear very much alarmed. Colonel Dundas was heard to say that an English and a French fleet had sailed at the same time. 
The intelligence concerning Count de Grasse has been 
kept a profound secret. 
</p><p>
My coming into this country has attracted this side 
a large portion of the enemy's force. In the meanwhile <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague met'>General Wayne</a> was filing off towards Westover, and the remainder of the army to Ruffin's Ferry. 
Should the enemy move southerly, we shall be at 
Westover before Wayne has done crossing, as the 
cavalry will be hurried. The moment Count de Grasse 
arrives, I will collect our force about Good's Bridge, 
and wait for intelligence from him. 
</p><p>
Colonel Gimat, and the French officers I have mentioned, are gone to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, under pretence to see 
the fortifications which I have ordered to be levelled, 
and will proceed to Cape Henry, in order to deliver 
my despatches to the French Commanders, and give 
them every information in their power. Heavy artillery, and every thing relative to a siege, from the 
cannon to the tool, are not to be found this side of 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. Clothing, and particularly shoes, arms, 
dragoons' and horse equipments, ammunition, are articles which your Excellency will be obliged to send 
from the northward. I may add, medicines and hospital stores. Could Lauzun's legion be forwarded with 
despatch, they will be extremely useful; they might 
come with you, and would, in the mean time, serve 
to the safety of your journey. 
</p><p>
As to provisions, my dear General, want of system 
will render our subsistence difficult, unless intelligent 
Commissaries are immediately sent on. If you intend, as I hope, to come yourself, you might send on 
the heads of departments. An early application upon 
the State of Maryland may be productive of great 
good. My expectations have not, as yet, been communicated to any General Officer, not even to the 
Executive. I wish to write a private letter to the 
Governor. Count de Grasse will arrive before long. 
In case important operations are carried on in Virginia, which, I think, cannot fail to succeed, <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a> ought to send some hard money. From the 
moment I took the command of this army, there has 
not been a farthing sent from the Treasury; and this 
State money is good for nothing. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis's force at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> was four thousand. There were then, at least, one thousand in 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. Some have been killed, and some are 
sick. But, if you add sailors, he will have much upwards of five thousand men, at the least. With the 
highest regard and affection, I have the honor to he, 
my dear General, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
