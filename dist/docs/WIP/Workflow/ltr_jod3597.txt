MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I RETURNED this day the visit of the cA-devant Due 
de Liancourt. He is a sensible man. He is cousin 
german of the late Due de la Rochefoucauld, and inherited his estate and, for what I know, his titles, but 
neither the estate nor the titles are of any use at present. What will be the future destiny of these high 
personages is a curious problem. I endeavored to impress upon him as I have upon all other Frenchmen, 
the necessity of an independent senate in France, 
incapable of being warped by ministers of state on 
one hand, or by popular demagogues on the other. 
</p><p>
I begin now to entertain hopes of soon hearing 
from our sons, to whom I have written by Mr. Green- 
leaf. 
</p><p>
This session of Congress is the most innocent I 
ever knew. We have done no harm. The English are so beaten and the French so triumphant, that 
I wonder there are not some projects for war. But it 
seems popularity is not now to be gotten by spirit. 
</p><p>
I know not what to write to you, unless I tell you 
I love you and long to see you ; but this will be no 
news. I wish I had a farm here. I would give you 
my chronicles of husbandry in return for yours. 
Three long months before I can see you. Oh ! what 
to do with myself I know not. 
</p><p>
My duty to my mother, and love to brothers and 
sisters and cousins. <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Morris</a> inquired of me the 
character of William Cranch. Be sure I gave him a 
good one. How is Mr. Wibird's health, and Mr. <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>'s ? 
</p><p>
Adieu.
