SIR: 
</p><p>
You will deliver all the horses you have, with the saddles, bridles, halter, and swords, except 14 of the ordinary horses which you will keep 
for your crops. The officers must give up every public horse they have. Col. Maham will send an officer to receive them. Mr, Withers has 
permission to send to Charlestown some tobacco to procure necessaries for the army You will give him passes when he applies for it, and receive whatever clothing he may get. I sent you a letter by Comodore Lockwood, informing that the British intend to go to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, under 
French colors and dress; you will, I dare say, prevent their deception from taking effect. I am apprehensive they will go to Waccamaw ; 
you will keep some boats ready at the ferry above Wragg's to cross over a few men on Waccamaw. Should they go there, a fire or two on them 
may make them go away. The whole of the men around your post should be called for if they do attempt. We are perfectly idle here. 
Nothing new but that deserters from the British come in every day. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
