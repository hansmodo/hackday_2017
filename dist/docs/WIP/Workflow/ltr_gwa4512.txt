Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The expectation of the pleasure of seeing you has 
prevented me hitherto from making a communication 
of a most important and interesting nature. But circumstances will not admit of further delay, and I must 
trust it to paper. It seems reduced almost to a certainty, that the enemy will reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with 
part of their troops from Virginia. In that case, the attempt against the former must be laid aside, as it will 
not be in our power to draw together a force sufficient 
to justify the undertaking. The detachment, which the 
enemy will probably leave in Virginia, seems the next 
object which ought to engage our attention, and which 
will be a very practicable one, should we obtain a naval 
superiority, of which I am not without hopes, and be 
able to carry a body of men suddenly round by water. 
The principal difficulty, which occurs, is obtaining transports at the moment they may be wanted ; for, if they 
are taken up beforehand, the use for which they are 
designed cannot be concealed, and the enemy will 
make arrangements to defeat the plan. 
</p><p>
What I would wish you to inform yourself of, therefore, without making a direct inquiry, is what number 
of tons of shipping could be obtained in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
at any time between this and the 20th of this month, 
and whether there could also be obtained at the same 
time a few deep-waisted sloops and schooners proper 
to carry horses. The number of double-decked vessels, which may be wanted, of two hundred tons and upwards, will not exceed thirty, I shall be glad of 
your answer as soon as possible, because, if it is favorable, I can direct certain preparations to be made in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and at other convenient places, without 
incurring any suspicions. There certainly can be no 
danger of not obtaining flour in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; and as 
you seem to have doubts of procuring salt meat there, 
I shall direct all that is at the eastward to be collected 
at places from whence it may be shipped upon the 
shortest notice. You will also oblige me by giving me 
your opinion of the number of vessels, which might 
be obtained at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, or other places in the Chesapeake, in the time before mentioned or thereabouts. 
I have the honor to be, &,c.
