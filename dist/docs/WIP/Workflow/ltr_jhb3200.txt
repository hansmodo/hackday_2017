SIR, 
</p><p>
I beg you to accept my sincerest acknowledgments 
for your very obliging letter. I find the character, 
which I before knew to be respectable, is also perfectly amiable ; and I should have few greater private gratifications in seeing our melancholy contest 
at an end, than that of cultivating your friendship. 
</p><p>
I shall take particular care of your letter to Mr. 
Fairfax. He is a gentleman much esteemed. I hope there is no reason to apprehend his death ; I heard 
no such report when I left England, last spring, nor 
have I seen it in any of the magazines since, most 
of which have come to my hands. I have the honor 
to be, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhb" rel="me">JOHN BURGOYNE</a>.
