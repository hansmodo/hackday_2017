My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 7th inst. I have no information of the intended removal of the deposits, though 
my opinion is that they will not dare to remove them. Nevertheless it is very desirable that whatever is done in the way 
of pacification should be done soon for if the deposits are withdrawn, it will be a declaration of war which cannot be recalled. . . .
