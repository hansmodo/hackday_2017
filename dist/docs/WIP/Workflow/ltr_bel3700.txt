My dear General, 
</p><p>
I take this early opportunity to inform your Excellency, that, in the late interview, no exchanges 
took place, and that I see little prospect that any 
will be effected while the idea remains that officers 
only are to be the subject of it. 
</p><p>
In the course of conversation with General Phillips 
(for nothing more took place between us relative to 
a general exchange of prisoners, as I early informed 
liim that I was not authorized to go into that matter), I found that he supposed the reason why we 
declined the exchange of privates, was, that we were 
unwilling to throw into their hands, in the middle of 
a campaign, such a reenforcement as they would receive by an exchange of all the privates. To obviate 
this difficulty he mentioned, that the exchange of 
privates might be postponed to some future day, say 
the first of December, sooner or later, as should be 
agreed on, but so as not to act this campaign. This, 
I hope, will remove the objections which have existed against a general exchange of privates. I think 
policy, justice, and humanity, point to the propriety 
of exchanging them, if not immediately, yet at the 
close of the campaign. Your Excellency will permit 
me to offer the reasons on which I ground this 
opinion. 
</p><p>
The men now prisoners of war (excuse the personality of my situation) are those who, from an attachment to the liberties of America, engaged in her 
cause from a reliance that they should not only find 
every support from their fellow-citizens, in the important contest, but that they should enjoy all the 
immunities and blessings peculiar to the soldier, in 
the power of the people to grant. That an exchange, 
when made a prisoner, is one of the rights of a soldier, none, I think, will deny, and that he may claim 
a release, when just and reasonable terms can be had. 
</p><p>
The long and distressing captivity which many of 
the prisoners have endured ; the severe sufferings to 
which many of them are now reduced, from nakedness and hunger, their constant attendants, and the 
want of almost every convenience and necessary of 
life, the miseries of which are augmented and embittered by the narrow limits of a loathsome jail, and their having no assurance that their sufferings will 
soon have an end, â€” call for redress. 
</p><p>
The prisoners, pained with regret, are become sore; 
their minds are soured, and their friends and connections think them neglected by the public. This may 
prevent the recruiting our battalions, and cause a 
disrelish for the service. Every thing of the kind, I 
think, should be avoided ; and this was never more 
necessary than at the present day, when it seems to 
be the general voice, that our only safety and the 
freedom of America (under the Supreme Arbiter) depend on an army raised for the war. If we should 
refuse to exchange the privates, on the proposals 
made, of man for man, it must, I think, operate powerfully on the minds of those who otherwise might 
engage in the service, when they reflect how uncertain are the events of war, and that it may be their 
lot to become the prisoners, and be destined to a 
miserable, perhaps to an endless, captivity. And, 
when the enemy shall have published their declaration of our refusal to accede to an equal and fair exchange, we may find it a matter of much difficulty 
to justify ourselves to the world at large, who will 
naturally enough suspect us of injustice in not fulfilling our public engagements, as they will accuse us 
of wanting humanity in neglecting those very men 
who have stepped forth to assert our rights. 
</p><p>
The daily decreasing of the number of the Convention troops, by deserting to the enemy, for which we 
have no compensation, and the great expense to which 
we are exposed for the support of them, and of our 
officers and men, prisoners of war with the enemy, 
must have their weight in urging to the propriety 
of an exchange. 
</p><p>
To the foregoing reasons (in my humble opinion 
sufficient in themselves) permit me, my dear General, 
to annex an apprehension for our unfortunate prisoners now in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The enemy, supposing themselves authorized by our refusal of an exchange, mr.y, 
under the pretence of economizing provisions, providing for their own safety, or some other plausible reason, have our prisoners removed to some distant, and 
consequently disagreeable, situation, where they may 
be subjected to less expense, &c. Should an event 
of this kind take place, retaliation is hardly in our 
power, as all parts of the Continent are equally 
agreeable to the British. 
</p><p>
I hope, Sir, on a review of the matter, as the objection of reenforcing the enemy this campaign is 
removed, a general exchange will be adopted, by 
which many of your officers and men, now suffering 
under the most miserable captivity, will be released, 
and once more have the honor of fighting, under your 
Excellency's particular command, in support of that 
independence of America, which induced them to quit 
the sweets of a domestic life for the toils of a camp, 
which no one will reenter with more cheerfulness, 
than he. 
</p><p>
Who has the honor to be, &c.,
