SIR, 
</p><p>
In answer to your Excellency's letter of the 7th 
instant, I beg leave to inclose to you extracts of a 
letter to his Excellency the President of Congress, 
from this Council, and of a representation from the 
Council and the General Assembly to Congress, by 
which your Excellency will see that attention has 
been given to the supplying of the army with wagons, and what is the opinion of the Council respecting the difficulties attending this business. 
</p><p>
There is not any State on this Continent which 
has been so oppressed with Continental business as 
this has been, from the beginning of the present controversy to this hour. Its exertions have been so 
zealous and unremitting, that no time has been lost 
in inquiries after groundless charges of neglect made against it, which have been generally calculated to 
excuse indolent or improvident officers, or to disgrace 
the government established in it. The amazingly 
difficult task, which your Excellency has to perform, 
while you are embarrassed with perpetual applications 
and complaints of officers, who are not fully acquainted with their duty, must too forcibly convince you 
how near to an impossibility it is to conduct very 
extensive business without the subordinate officers discharging, in some sort, their duty ; and it is from the 
example of your Excellency alone, that it is believed 
to be possible to conduct the affairs of a large army, 
under the difficulties which you have had to contend 
with. Equal abilities or success in attempts of this 
kind are not to be expected in many instances. And 
this Council must acknowledge that they are not 
equal to the task imposed on them, if it is under 
stood to be their duty to furnish every Deputy Quarter-master with four or five wagons, whenever they 
are wanted, and to give equal attention to every other 
department of the State and army. This, indeed, 
seems to be expected of them; for there is, at present, 
an absolute dependence on the Council to supply the 
common rations of the soldiery now in the borough. 
An earnest desire to serve the general cause, and a 
zealous attachment to its interest, are the only motives which could possibly induce the Council to undertake such business in any extremity. 
</p><p>
The unparalleled patience and magnanimity with 
which the army, under your Excellency's command, 
have endured the hardships attending their situation, 
unsupplied as they have been through an uncommonly 
severe winter, is an honor which posterity will con 
sider as more illustrious than could have been derived to them by a victory obtained by any sudden and 
vigorous exertion. The latter often depends on some 
circumstance trifling in itself, while the former is derived from a determined perseverance through the 
greatest difficulties, which virtue and a truly patriotic 
spirit only can inspire. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>
