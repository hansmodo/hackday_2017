SIR, 
</p><p>
Inclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague met'>Count D Estaing</a>. He has had the river sounded, and 
finds he cannot enter. He will sail for Rhode Island 
to-morrow evening ; in the mean time, he is making 
demonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an 
opinion that he intends to operate in this quarter. 
He would sail immediately, but he waits the arrival, 
or to hear, of a frigate which carried M. Gerard to 
Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at 
Sandy Hook, so that he fears his sudden and unexpected departure, before she arrives, might cause her 
to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than 
till to-morrow evening. We have agreed that five 
cannon, fired briskly, shall be a signal of his arrival 
by day, and the same number, with five sky-rockets,a signal by night. 
</p><p>
In communicating this to <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>, the Count 
wishes not a moment may be lost, and that he may 
be directed to have persons stationed on the coast, 
and intermediate expresses to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will be a material article. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much 
as possible, and as many troops collected as may be. 
He would be glad if a detachment could march from 
your army, or could be sent by water, for which purpose he would send covering ships and some vessels 
he has taken by way of transports ; but he cannot 
think of losing so much time as seems necessary. If 
the water scheme could shorten it, it would be a 
happy circumstance. He recommends it to your attention, and that you would take measures, if the end 
can be better answered in this way, and meet him with information of the part he may have to act to 
execute the plan. I perceive he can with difficulty 
debark four thousand troops, but he will try to do it. 
I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most respectful and obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEXANDER HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I hope your Excellency will excuse my not 
being myself the bearer of these particulars ; the end 
may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is anxious 
to get on. I have just heard of despatches arrived 
from you ; I don t know but they may contain some 
thing new, which may make the Count wish a good 
conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to 
morrow morning may answer that end. I shall not 
delay coming forward.
