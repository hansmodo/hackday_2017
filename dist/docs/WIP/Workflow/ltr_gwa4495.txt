Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The enclosed letter to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> is 
of very great importance, and requires the utmost secrecy in its communication. This idea you will convey to the Count before its delivery, to effect which 
you will first converse with the Chevalier Chastellux 
on the mode of its communication. Its object is to 
inform the Count, that I have in contemplation a very 
sudden surprise of some post of the enemy, which will 
be of very great importance in our operations, and 
which we have flattering expectations of obtaining ; to 
cover and support which, if obtained, we shall want the 
aid of the French army ; in which case, it will be necessary for the Count to push on his troops with greater 
haste, than he at present intends, and by a different 
route from that now in his view. The <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion is to advance. 
</p><p>
The movements, which I would wish to be made by 
the French army, are particularized in my letter to the Count, which you will see. It will be for you to impress the gentlemen with the miportance of their motions to support our operations, as it will be to httle 
purpose for us to obtain advantages, which we may not 
be able to maintain. 
</p><p>
As the Count, with his troops, is now in a very disaffected part of the country, and the Tories will be 
desirous to give every information in their power, the 
most profound secrecy will be necessary. Secrecy and 
despatch must prove the soul of success to the enterprise. This idea you will impress with energy, using 
your best discretion in the mode. I am, &,c.
