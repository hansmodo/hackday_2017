GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure of your letter by General Thompson and 
Colonel St. Glair, who arrived safe here last evening. Herewith 
you have a letter from General Thomas, who is hourly expected 
here. It came by an express, who told me he had orders to deliver the letter to me, and wait my answer. I apprehended there 
might be some mistake in the superscription, and took the liberty 
of opening it, which you will excuse. 
</p><p>
I am. very happy to find you are in sentiments with me in 
respect to the smallpox. General Thompson and all the officers 
agree with us, and think it advisable to inoculate Colonel Patterson's regiment at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, Colonel Bedel's at the Cedars, and 
the troops posted at Laprairie and Longueil at those places. It 
is thought most advisable to send all the troops at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> 
here who have had the smallpox, and to send five or six hundred men from this to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, who will be at no expense of 
getting up, as they can row themselves. It will be very difficult 
to provide them quarters on the Sorel, except at such a distance 
as will render it extremely difficult to visit and supply them 
with provisions and other necessaries. This difficulty will be obviated at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, as they will be near together, and may be 
quartered on the inhabitants (if the barracks are not sufficient) ; 
and, among the whole, a sufficient number of men will be found 
well to keep the garrison. The distance of time you mention 
between inoculating them will doubtless be most prudent. As 
soon as General Thomas arrives, I expect a Council of War will 
be immediately held. I shall be for keeping Dechambeau by 
all means, if it can be done without too great a hazard of our 
army. Our own strength (which at present is uncertain), and 
the advice which we may receive of the numbers and designs of 
the enemy, must govern our movements. I believe the difficulty 
of provisions may be got over; but the smallpox, and gondolas 
to secure our navigation and retreat, are very great obstacles in 
our way. 
</p><p>
We have here about three tons of powder. There is a quantity at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> ; how much, I am uncertain. The distribution 
of the bateaux is already made, and twenty are sent from this 
to St. John s. Immediately on my arrival here, I sent to Maska. 
I have received from thence one hundred and seventy-six bags 
of flour, I believe the same you refer to. As soon as Mr. 
Bonfield arrives, I shall employ him to collect all the flour in 
this neighbourhood, who will, at the same time, call on Mr. Belfeuil, and receive such goods as may answer our purpose. I 
have in contemplation the sinking a chevaux-de-frise at the is 
lands five miles below this, where the channel is very narrow ; but 
the water is so high we cannot fortify at present. Two other 
vessels will be ordered to <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a> the first fair wind. I beg 
my respectful compliments to the ladies, who, I hear, are returned with you ; and am, with great affection and esteem, Gentle 
men, &c., 
</p><p>
