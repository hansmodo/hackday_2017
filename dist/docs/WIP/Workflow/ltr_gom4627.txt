Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last was of the twenty-seventh of September. Since 
that period, and within a few days, I have received yours of the sixteenth of June. In sunding the gazettes, it would be 
well, I think, to put them in an envelope open at each end, and 
direct them to the Consul at Havre, who should be desired to 
forward them to me by the stage. This will avoid the heavy 
postage. 
</p><p>
The unexpected events, which have taken place in this coun 
try since your letter was written, and of which you will have 
been informed before this reaches you, will show you that I 
cannot, until I receive the President's farther orders, take up 
any of the objects to which it alludes, not having indeed the 
proper powers. I apprehend also that the United States will 
wish to see a little into the establishment of the new Republic, 
before they take any decided steps in relation to it. In this 
case I may be a long lime without such orders, which is to me 
a distressing circumstance, because it involves a degree of responsibility for events, which no human being can foresee. It 
may indeed be replied, that in a position like mine, the proper 
conduct is to preserve a strict neutrality, and of course to do 
nothing ; but cases often arise in which to do nothing is taking 
a part. I need not state the many situations of that sort which 
occur. I had it in contemplation to leave Paris, and visit 
Bordeaux and Marseilles, but I found it necessary to continue 
here for the sake of such of my countrymen as were in this 
city, and who might, in the madness of the moment, have 
been exposed to danger, but certainly to inconvenience. A 
proof of which is, that the English, who remained after Lord Gower went away, found it so difficult to obtain passports, 
though possessed of those he had given, that many, after waiting for weeks in fruitless attendance, went off at all hazards 
without them. 
</p><p>
I informed you in my last, that I believed the plan for speculating on the sum appropriate d for St Domingo, was abandoned, but a further attempt was made by the Minister, who 
pressed me again on the subject, and I of course again declined, referring him to Mr Short, who in fact is alone em 
powered in that respect. What they may have since done,, I 
know not. The intercourse with Holland is much interrupted 
just now, and a letter which Mr Pinckney forwarded for me 
by Colonel Smith, from Mr Short, and which was put into the 
postoffice at Dieppe, has not yet come to hand. I suppose 
that it relates to M. de Lafayette, who is, I am told, at Wezel, 
and of course in the power of his Prussian Majesty. 
</p><p>
The gazettes will inform you of the retreat of the Prussian 
army. I have been told on good authority, that the cannonade of the twentieth of September was only to amuse ; that 
during its continuance the Duke of Brunswick made a masterly movement, by which he opened to himself the roads to 
Rheims, and to Chalons; that the French army was so 
much in his power, that he might either have driven them 
away and dissipated them, or if under every disadvantage they 
would risk an action, that he could have cut them to pieces. 
And why did he not ? To this natural question two answers 
are given. It is said, that the plan fixed for the campaign 
was, that the King of Prussia, at the head of his army, should 
form the point of a wedge, of which two columns of Austrian 
troops should form the angles. The right, under General 
Clairfayt, to penetrate the Loisons ; the left, under the Prince 
de Hohenloe, to penetrate, after masking Thionville and Metz, 
to Chalons. That by this means the magazines, sick, and 
wounded, of the three armies, would have been completely 
covered, and the police of the country been maintained by the 
emigrants, under the immediate orders of the King's brothers. 
Another body of troops was at the same time to make a powerful diversion, or to penetrate, as circumstances might permit, or direct, from the Brisgaw. 
</p><p>
You will observe, that all which depended on the Austrians, 
in the plan above supposed, completely failed, and that in con 
sequence, if the King of Prussia had advanced any farther, the 
French would have closed in upon his rear, and of course his 
sick, his wounded, and his magazines, would have been sacrificed, perhaps his retreat cut off. It is said that the three days 
consumed in treaty, were to give time to the columns in question to advance, and by their demonstrations to drive off the 
corps, which infested one of his flanks, and menaced the other r 
and to show at the same time that he had completely performed his stipulations. In effect he had surmounted the obstacles,, 
which nature had opposed to his march, had disentangled him 
self from ihe Ardennes, and was complete in force, and in view 
of the two great plains of Champagne, the one leading by 
Rheims, and the other by Chalons, to his object. 
</p><p>
It is said, that without the aid of the columns in question., 
his farther progress would have been useless, because he could 
not detach to the right and left so as to cut off the communication between this city, and the southern and western parts of 
the Empire. To this it is added, that a season of which there 
is no parallel in the memory of man, and disease beyond all 
reasonable expectation, had almost crippled the Duke's army 
before he could extricate himself from the defiles, and drive 
off the parties which were in possession of them. 
</p><p>
This is one solution of the events, which took place subsequent to the twentieth. Another is of a different nature; it is 
said that Monsieur Dumouriez, convinced that an opposition ta 
the combined forces would prove unavailing, and supposing 
that the rivalry of Austria and Prussia must prevent any cordiality of union ; being farther induced to believe, that the 
Prussian cabinet would pursue its own separate interest when 
occasion should offer, without much regard to previous stipulations, and would in fact, rather sacrifice somewhat even of its 
particular interest, than aggrandize in any degree a rival, sore 
from ancient and recent injuries ; Dumouriez, prompted and 
encouraged by these ideas, sought eagerly the occasions of 
treaty with the King of Prussia. That at length he succeeded 
so far as to show that Prince, that the present was a favorable 
moment for giving a final blow to the House of Austria, and 
that France and Prussia would find immense advantage in a 
union, by which he might take up again the business he had 
abandoned in Poland, and thereby foil the schemes of both 
Russia and Austria, That a more evident advantage, though 
not more certain, would be found in a subsidy of two hundred 
millions of livres, and that he must see the danger of the war 
in its present situation, and might thence the more easily estimate the advantage of abandoning it. 
</p><p>
These reasonings are said to have had the desired effect, 
and that a kind of treaty was entered into ; one article of 
which related to the Royal Family of this country, which is 
to be set at liberty. I have been told farther, that the Executive Council here will not confirm that part of the bargain 
which relates to the subsidy and the Royal Family, saying, 
which is true enough, that they are in this respect without 
authority. 
</p><p>
I must slightly mention another solution of the late movements, because it is possible that it may be well founded. A 
lady, I think Madame de Guisne, but certainly the daughter of 
Madame de Polignac, is said to have made an impression on 
his Majesty, who is, it seems, very susceptible of violent, 
though not of lasting affection. This young lady is said to 
have been ill treated by her mother, and others who are 
among the principal emigrants, and to have used her influence 
with the King to avenge the slights of her countrymen and 
relations. In the midst of all these different accounts, of 
which perhaps not one is true, the leaders here seem to con 
sider Prussia as weighing no longer in the scale against them. Duiaouriez is on his march to Brussels, in which he means to 
take up his winter quarters, and there is in this more of cool 
good sense than at first sight may appear. 
</p><p>
I have already communicated to you the state of things 
here, in what regards subsistence. The country, late the seat 
of war, is totally consumed. Never abundant, it is now T so 
bare that the inhabitants will be reduced to the utmost straits, 
and although the northern frontier is not yet in the same state, 
it would be not far from it before the end of January, if the 
whole of the French army, late in the centre, were stationed 
there. This army is now very numerous, and, from the want 
of discipline, consumes much more than is usually allotted to 
one of equal number. It is furthermore very sickly, and of 
course the followers must be greatly increased. If he can 
penetrate into Flanders and Brabant, he not only saves the 
provisions which would have been consumed in France, but 
he destroys so much of the resources of the enemy. If he 
can create .a revolution, which may be effected by a very 
small number of the people while supported by a victorious 
army, he obliges the Emperor to confine his efforts to a single 
side of France, namely, that defended by the Ardennes in 
part, and in part by the Rhine. And on this side; it will be 
very difficult to make any serious impression, so long as the 
French continue in their present mind. These objects justify 
some risk by M. Dumouriez ; and he is better able to calculate the extent of that risk, than any mere spectator, 
because he has long had intelligence in that country. The 
undertaking is not however without considerable difficulty. 
There are not indeed any strong towns in his way, but there 
are three strong positions, of which the first is near Mons ; the 
second still stronger on a hill about half way (to the best of 
my recollection) between Mons and Brussels ; and the third 
not far from Brussels itself. The military face of that country is, you know, understood by all military men with 
perfect exactness, having been the theatre of war for the two 
last centuries ; of course all the advantages, which it gives to 
disciplined armies, will be made use of by those who are to 
defend it. Add to this, that we approach the end of October, 
and though we are just now flattered with fine weather, it is 
not to be expected that those who go due north will meet 
with warm nights and long days in November. A failure 
therefore must be fatal to many ; but this is little thought of 
here just now, because there is no want of men. It will 
count, however, in the next season. Fortune has hitherto 
smiled on the French arms in a manner unexpected to them 
selves, and it may perhaps continue to do so. Much of this 
is in my opinion owing to the folly of their opponents, who 
seem to have fostered the determination to reduce them 
under a military despotism. The Divine justice will never, I 
hope, permit such impious plans to succeed ; and I always con 
sider Princes, and Generals, and Statesmen, as mere instruments, and generally blind instruments, in the hands of the 
Almighty to work out his ends by ways, which are for the 
most part inscrutable to us. 
</p><p>
I do not say anything about the incursions into Savoy and 
Germany, both brilliant, and the former of which bids fair to 
extend the French Republic to the foot of the Alps, because 
these things, fully detailed in the gazettes, speak for them 
selves. 
</p><p>
As to the domestic affairs here, they are by no means quiet. 
The great majority of the Convention is united in opposition to 
a few members, who are joined to some chiefs in this city, and 
meditate further revolutions. They aver that those, whom they 
call the Brissotines, had no wish to overturn the monarchy, 
but only to get the loaves and fishes for themselves and their 
friends. That the affair of the tenth of August happened not 
only without their aid, but contrary to their wish. That having 
happened, they did indeed take advantage of it to obtain the 
executive power for their particular friends, but even they would 
not consolidate the revolution by destroying its enemies ; a 
business, say they, which was effected on the second of September, and the following days, and which those who now safely enjoy the fruits of it pretend to blame. 
</p><p>
The Brissotines on the other hand contend, that they alone 
are the true friends of republican government, for which they 
have incessantly labored, ever since the second Assembly met. 
That the attachment they professed to the late constitution was 
only simulated, arid was necessary to cover their attack 
upon it ; that in their various decrees they constantly kept in 
view the advantage to be gained by obliging the King, either 
to sanction what (though agreeable to the popular wish) was 
contrary to the constitution, in which case the constitution would 
have become a dead letter, and have left the field of contest 
open between the King and the legislature, or else, if the King 
withheld his sanction, it turned the voice of the people against 
him, and left him in consequence exposed to a successful attack, 
whenever the favorable moment should present itself. That 
it was they, in short, who brought forward the plan of an army 
of twenty thousand republicans under the walls of Paris, and 
who took private and effectual measures to bring that army in 
to the field, if, as was apprehended, the King should put a veto 
on the decree. That it was owing to these measures, that the 
Bretons and Marsellois, and other Federes, were on the spot to 
execute the plans of the tenth of August, &tc. 
</p><p>
These are the outlines of the arguments made use of on 
each side to convince the public, that each is exclusively the au 
thor of a republic, which the people find themselves possessed 
of by a kind of magic, or at least a slight of hand, and which 
nevertheless they are as fond of as if it were their own offspring. 
</p><p>
To these main arguments are added a number of subordinate ones, with all the little accessories of time, place, and circumstance. The majority of the Convention, however, diffident of the people of this city, and apprehensive that they may 
take it into their heads to make another revolution, when they 
grow tired of the present state of things, have called (privately) for a guard from the different departments. This now 
forms the bone of contention. You will see in the gazettes the 
arguments pro and con. I own that I think it a false stroke in 
politics, though, as a peaceable citizen of Paris, and interested 
in the preservation of order, it is personally agreeable to me. 
On the ground of argument it is clearly a feature not republican, and prima facie implies that the Convention means to do 
things, which a majority of the capital would disapprove, and 
hence it follows again, that either the interests of the capital 
and the provinces are different, or else that the measures in 
contemplation are contrary to the inclinations of both. But it 
is not, I think, on the ground of theoretic argument, that such 
things are to be tried, but from an examination of probable 
consequences. A guard of this sort evidently draws a strong 
broad line of separation between the city and the Convention. 
It gives of course many means for operating on the people to 
those, who are opposed to the Convention. It is among the 
things to be calculated on, that the guard after it has been here 
some time should catch the spirit of the city, be that what it 
may. In such case, instead of protectors they will find enemies in their guard ; but admitting that this should not happen, 
if the guard be feeble, it will be overawed ; if strong, those who 
can influence the guard, will command the Convention, who in 
this case will only have changed masters. If any little check 
should happen on the frontiers, it will be too unpopular to keep 
a considerable body of men for parade, who might be useful 
in camp ; and as soon as they go, the people will rise at once 
to resent the insult offered to them. It seems probable, there 
fore, that this guard will be among the reasons why the Convention may leave this city, and that would give a very serious 
shock, and in many ways. It is to be noted also, that when 
they shall take up a report on the form of government, the op 
position will find vast resources in the opinions of the majority, 
let those be what they may. To these leading points, I might 
add a thousand little things, but you would be tired of such 
particularities. 
</p><p>
With respect to the present temper of the people of this 
country, I am clearly of opinion, that the great decided effective majority is now for the republic. What may be the temper and opinion six months hence, no prudent sensible man 
would, I think, take upon him to declare. Much must depend 
on the form of government, which shall be presented by the 
Convention. If vigorous, it is very problematical whether the 
departments will adopt it, unless compelled by a sense of impending exterior danger. If feeble, it is (humanly speaking) 
impossible that it can control the effervescent temper of this 
people, and that appears sufficiently by the fate of the late 
constitution. Whether they will be able to strike out that happy mean, which secures all the liberty which circumstances admit of, combined with all the energy which the same circum 
stances require ; whether they can establish an authority which 
does not exist, as a substitute (and always a dangerous substitute) for that respect, which cannot be restored after so much 
has been done to destroy it; whether, in crying down and 
even ridiculing religion, they will be able on the tottering and 
uncertain base of metaphysical philosophy to establish a solid 
edifice of morals ; these are questions which time must solve. 
I am, &c.
