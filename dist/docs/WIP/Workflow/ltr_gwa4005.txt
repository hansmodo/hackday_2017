Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Not having received from your excellency, during the 
last winter or summer, the acknowledgment of any letter, 
except of my public despatches of October last, I apprehend that some private letters, which I have had the pleasure of addressing to you since that time, have miscarried. 
I resume my pen, therefore, to repeat the thanks which 
were contained in one of them, for the wine you had the 
goodness to present me with ; and to assure you that I entertain the friendly sentiments towards you which I have 
ever experienced since our first acquaintance. 
</p><p>
We have now passed another campaign, and no very 
important occurrence has intervened on this side the Atlantic. The evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> was considered by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, in his last letters to me, as an event that 
would certainly take place ; and from other circumstances 
I am induced to believe it is effected by this time. Part of 
the garrison (the British troops) will probably go to the West Indies, and the Germans to the northward. Admiral Pigot is now in New- York harbour, with twenty-six heavy 
ships, ready wooded and watered for sea ; but the present circumstances, though somewhat equivocal, do not indicate 
that New-York will be abandoned this year ; notwithstanding there have been many reports and conjectures of the kind some weeks ago. 
</p><p>
The Marquis De Vaudruille is in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour with 
twelve sail of the line (three excepted, which are at 
<a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>), having unfortunately stranded and lost the 
Magnifique on entering that bay. But Congress have presented to his most Christian Majesty the ship America, of 
74 guns, built at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and now nearly fit for sea. 
</p><p>
The changes in the British ministry, and the fluctuation 
of their councils, are the subjects of universal speculation, 
We wait with impatience to hear the result of the negotiations, and not being very sanguine in our expectations, 
endeavour to hold ourselves prepared for every contingency. I am certain it will afford you pleasure to know 
that our army is better organized, disciplined, and clothed, 
than it has been at any period since the commencement of 
the war. This you may be assured is the fact. 
</p><p>
I shall always be happy to hear from you, especially at 
the present important crisis of European politics ; and beg 
you will be persuaded, that with the warmest wishes and 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Jay, I am, with sentiments of the highest regard and esteem, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, your excellencv's most obedient 
And humble servant,
