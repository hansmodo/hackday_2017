DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I thank you for your letter and a copy of the recent speech delivered by you in the Senate of the United States. 
</p><p>
I need say nothing in commendation of your course, which has been so generally approved, and will proceed (without referring to any difference of opinion 
that may seem to exist between us on the subject) to communicate to you my candid and long-cherished opinions on the subject of slavery as it exists in the 
United States, and the duty of the Government and the people in connection with it. 
</p><p>
In view of a national crisis in the affairs of Great Britain, one of her eminent statesmen once said,  In order to be prepared for the trials of these times, we 
should be possessed of a prompt facility of adverting in all our doubts to some grand and comprehensive truth. In a deep and strong soil must that tree fix 
its roots, the height of which is to reach to heaven, and the sight of it to the ends of the earth. 
</p><p>
A great crisis presents itself in the path of the Republic. Interests of incalculable consequence are involved in it to you, to myself, to every citizen consequences not limited to our times, but extending onward to all future generations, and, if there is any thing in the hopes that have been cherished of the 
universally progressive principles of liberty, to the world for ages to come. There are times (says another eminent person) when the assertion of great 
principles is the best service a man can render society, and this is such a time. We are all called upon to pause at the present crisis and consider well what 
are the demands of duty. It is no time to palter about party distinctions or sectional differences ; now, if ever, it becomes us to feel that we are Americans 
only Americans. It is no time to calculate questions of personal popularity ; that sacrifice which any citizen may make is as nothing, if it contributes to save 
his country. A Jerseyman myself, born on one of those proud battle-fields where American liberty was purchased, bearing a life devoted to the service of 
the Union, I can withhold nothing from the cause of that Union with which I solemnly believe liberty is herself identified, one and inseparable. 
</p><p>
It appears to me that the polar truth to which the view of our fellow-citizens should be directed in the present emergency is this: that God works in the 
affairs of nations, and shapes them to his purposes ; and that to ascertain his will we must study in the school of his providences, and take counsel from the 
observation of his ways to regulate our own. The destinies of men and of nations are in the bosom of the Most High. He lives in the history of the past ; 
he will live in the history of the future ; and he who has most deeply reflected upon the records of the past has most clearly seen that the great characteristics 
which have marked the progress of every nation, in every age, have eventually resulted in the accomplishment of some grand design in which the hand of 
Providence, though for a time obscured by shadows, has been at last clearly and distinctly seen. 
</p><p>
Of this our own history furnishes a luminous example. The preparation for the erection of the great temple of civil and religious liberty we now inhabit 
began in the discoveries and convulsions of the fifteenth century. The materials for it were found in men schooled by providential trials and disciplined to the 
work they were to commence ; and it is as rational to suppose the world was the production of chance, as to suppose that the combination of events which 
led them to this continent, which cherished and protected their infant colonies, which brought about the Revolution and its results, and has made us what we 
are, was the work of chance ; it is this which inspires me with hope that He 
who founded the Republic will save it that he has great purposes to accomplish yet, and that they will be unfolded through successive years for ages to 
come, in perfecting the institutions of a rational freedom here, and in extending them to all other continents. 
</p><p>
Though men were the instruments, the American Revolution was the work of an unseen Power ; the actors in it themselves looked back with astonishment 
at the course they had taken and the results that had been accomplished. The greater the event, the more clearly has the hand of Providence always been 
seen in it ; the greater the hero, the more heartfelt always has been his acknowledgment that a superior destiny controlled his actions. The American Constitution is the result of a fearful struggle. Its full price was by no means the 
sufferings undergone in the conflict. The series of events by which it was accomplished we are now able to trace distinctly back, through the privations 
and trials of the early colonists, to the days when popular freedom first began the contest with arbitrary power in the civil wars of England ; and its pathway 
is everywhere marked with patient endurance and costly sacrifice. 
</p><p>
Things permanently good are of slow growth : the offspring of hardship, they are made strong through suffering. So universal is this law, that the most 
hasty minds have a secret misgiving of the efficacy of hasty products ; and we would as soon expect undisciplined troops to be equal to the hardships and 
perils of a dangerous campaign, as that an undisciplined community could triumph in that fiercest of all warfares, the warfare which marks everywhere 
the pathway to national existence, greatness, and virtue. 
</p><p>
More than two centuries have passed since the events which were to result in founding the Republic were put in motion ; and who does not perceive, both in 
our colonial and constitutional history, that the process by which we have, within a comparatively few years, come to the full achievement of a distinctive 
nationality, has been one mainly of forbearance and self-denial? Nor have we been the only sufferers. When our ancestors came to this country, they found 
it in the possession of another race. That race has had their day. A great continent, fitted by nature for large developments in the progress of humanity, had beer, for centuries committed to their keeping, and they had proved faithless to their trust. It was manifest, from the commencement of the struggles, 
that one of the two races must give way to the other, and no one doubts the beneficence of that Providence which decided for the Anglo-Saxon race. Yet 
how touching is the story of the red man's wrongs ! We commiserate his sufferings, while we clearly see that the decree by which his race wastes away before 
the advancing footsteps of civilization is the fiat of Infinite Wisdom. 
</p><p>
The same all-pervading Providence has brought us in contact with still an other race, the African, but under widely different circumstances. Out of 
this circumstance, and the events connected with it, the crisis we are now considering has grown. Three millions of that race, scattered through fifteen of 
the States of the Union, are in the condition of servitude. Individuals in the non-slaveholding States have not only been long in the habit of denouncing the 
holding of slaves as a sin, as, indeed, among the worst of crimes, but have insisted on immediate and unconditional abolition have carried on the work of 
agitation have encouraged slaves to desert their masters have protected fugitive slaves from pursuit and reclamation, and have even gone so far as to declare that it was cause for separating from the South altogether. 
</p><p>
The General Government has been agitated ; compromise after compromise has been made, and proved, as was to be expected, only the means of postponing rather than of settling the question, until at last things have reached a 
condition that real danger to the Union seems to be apprehended by the wisest men of both sections of the country. It is time for men now to speak out, calmly, but fearlessly. Whatever has been wrong should be made right, and 
the question settled now and forever. We should not meanly shrink from our just responsibilities and put them upon our children. 
</p><p>
Now, in reference to the relation of master and slave, it is proper we should bear in mind that African slavery was introduced into this country by no act of ours. For its introduction the American people are in no just sense responsible. 
Its introduction here was the act of Great Britain while we were her colonies. 
She engrafted this system into our communities at a time when these communities (then in their infancy) were unable to make any effectual resistance. 
Our ancestors, at the time, and through all the process by which it was accomplished, remonstrated and protested against it; but their remonstrances and 
protests were unheeded. Its introduction was considered by the early colonists an evil a measure of oppression to them as well as to the slave ; but they were as powerless to resist it as the slave himself. 
</p><p>
So far as we are concerned, this circumstance in our condition is providential. If we would presume to scrutinize and judge the ways of Providence, we are driven back to first principles. God rules in the affairs of nations and of men 
as an absolute sovereign, and shapes all human events to his great purposes. The purposes he designed to accomplish in all this may be involved in comparative darkness now; but if it shall appear hereafter that this was the means 
by which, in the lapse of centuries, he accomplished the redemption of Africa her self, who will say that the means he chose were inconsistent with his wisdom or his goodness? 
</p><p>
This fact, then, is undisputed, that when the battles of the Revolution had been fought when the North and the South had passed shoulder to shoulder through that long and bloody and self-sacrificing struggle, and the independence 
of their country was achieved, the institution of slavery, planted by other hands in our midst, existed. A very large number of our citizens, both in the North 
and South, were slaveholders. Property is the creature of the law, and slaves had been made property by law been so held for ages. What was to be done ? The general welfare the preservation of all that had been gained the law of 
self-defence required that a Government should be established, and that this Government should embrace and combine in one indissoluble union all the liberated colonies. If that had not been accomplished, all would have been 
shipwrecked together. 
</p><p>
The men of the Revolution saw this plainly. They were men equal to the crisis. They considered the question as a whole. They sacrificed on the altar of concession their different views and interests as to particulars, that they 
might reach harmoniously the grand result. The articles of confederation, and subsequently the Constitution, were the results of compromise; and whatever politicians may say the spirit the intent the fair construction of that com 
promise is, that the institution of slavery belongs exclusively to the States, as a matter of State regulation, and that the General Government has nothing to do with it. 
</p><p>
No power over it was delegated by the Constitution to the General Government, (except as to the importation of slaves into the States,) nor was any such 
power prohibited by it to the States. It was expressly provided that persons held to service or labour in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into an 
other, should not be discharged from such service or labour, but should be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour might be due ; 
and by an amendment to the Constitution, adopted in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a>, it was provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the 
people. Such is the Constitution such the compromise upon which it was formed such the imperative necessity of that compromise : and even if that 
compromise and that Constitution were the result of a mistake, it is binding now, and as long as it shall remain unaltered, on every law-abiding man. 
</p><p>
If the toleration of slavery if the permission for its existence in any part of the Union was a great national crime, when and by whom was that crime committed ? At the formation of the Government, at the adoption of the Constitution, and by the Washingtons, the Roger Shermans, the Hamiltons, the Madisons, the Franklins, the Pinkneys, of the land by such men as Livingston and 
Paterson, Brearly and Dayton, of my own native State, approved and sanctioned with unparalleled unanimity by the North and South. Under its auspices, I 
need not say with what giant strides the Republic has advanced to greatness and prosperity, nor that heaven has smiled propitiously upon our common heritage. 
</p><p>
Now, the question which has come up with such a threatening aspect before the country is, in my judgment, one of morals, not of politics, questions always 
the most difficult and dangerous to deal with, because they do not lie in notions of expediency, but in matters of conscience. They are always liable to run into 
fanaticism, and are always mingled with questions of religious faith and moral obligation. The question is one of morals, and as such it is to be settled, if 
settled permanently at all. Out of this aspect of the case have sprung, as incidents, all the questions that have heretofore been and are now the subjects of 
discussion. The Convention of 87, the Missouri Compromise, the contested 
question of abolition petitions in Congress, the agitations in the North, the recriminations of the South, the difficulties about fugitive slaves, and latterly, the 
California question and the Wilmot Proviso, are all but branches of one fruitful tree the question as to the moral character of slavery as it exists in the States, 
and the moral duty consequent upon that character. In reference to those phases or incidents of this question, which involve the action of the Government, 
they never would have been unsettled, or at any rate never would have come up in their present embarrassing forms, if the General Government had adhered, as 
it ought in my opinion to have adhered, from the beginning, to a strict construction of the Constitution. The framers of this instrument meant to exclude, 
and by the language of the instrument did exclude, the national Government from all action upon the subject. 
</p><p>
They granted no such power ; they expressly excluded all powers not granted. Whenever the doctrine of inferential powers that latitudinarian doctrine comes fully to be insisted on and adopted, the Constitution will become itself a 
thing of wax, to be moulded, by the ever-changing opinions of men, into whatever shape those opinions happen to take ; the majority will become supreme ; 
its will, the Constitution, and every thing conservative, will be liable to be broken down. Suppose a measure oppressive ruinous to one portion of the 
Union, is adopted by a mere constitutional majority, and in constitutional form: 
it is said the party complaining and denying its constitutionality has an appeal to the Supreme Court. But to argue that that is always to be regarded as 
a place of absolute security, is to argue that it is infallible. It undergoes the process of change by death ; the new incumbents are apt to partake of the views 
of the Constitution held by a majority of the Government, and the Court to become itself the advocate of those views. Beyond this are the rocks, the breakers 
of revolution the dernier resort of an oppressed people. The Constitution itself was originally intended to be the cable and anchor of the Union and all its 
parts ; and nothing, you may rely upon it, but the doctrine of a strict construction, can ever preserve it what it was intended to be. 
</p><p>
Upon the question of domestic slavery in the States and in the territories, non intervention is the true principle. There the letter of the Constitution placed it, 
and there it should be left. The law of nature, fixing the bounds of the institution by the unalterable constitution of the coloured race, the temperature of 
the climate and nature of the soil, and the will of the people acting through the 
State Legislatures upon their several States, are the true and legitimate regulators ; and all interference, except moral suasion, the power of argument, the 
free expression of opinion, ought to be excluded. 
</p><p>
I now come to the main question the question which lies back of all the others. 1. Is domestic slavery a sin, or an unmitigated evil? and, 2. What is 
the duty of the people of the non-slaveholding States respecting it? These questions go to the root of the whole difficulty. 
</p><p>
1. Is domestic slavery a sin, or an unmitigated evil? In order to arrive at an intelligent conclusion respecting the right or the wrong of any complex 
scheme or any existing institution, we must be careful not to array our feelings against our reason ; nor ought we to allow our displeasure at particular cases 
of excess to interfere with a fair and deliberate consideration of the general working and tendency of the system as a whole. It belongs to this question to 
consider, 1. The condition of the coloured man as it would have been had he been left in Africa. 2. The circumstances under which we find him here. 3. 
The necessity, if such there be, of his present continuance in the condition in which we find him. 4. The ultimate tendency of what may seem to be a providential arrangement of this state of things. 
</p><p>
1. Of all the races of men with which history and travel have acquainted us, there is none so sunk beyond all hope of self-restoration as the African on his wide continent. In ignorance so utter that he is elevated little above the brute, 
in superstition so gross that it drags him even lower than the brute, without a thought of liberty, he is the sport of tyranny in its lowest, meanest, and most cruel forms ; he has nothing he can call his own ; he has no idea of God, of 
justice, of moral obligation, of the rights of persons or property. In a word, Africa has long forgotten God, and God has abandoned Africa but not, I trust, forever. From such a land and such a condition sold, bartered away by 
his countrymen the slave was brought to these shores while we were colonists and subject to British law. Here he is in a civilized and Christian country ; he has more opportunities of enlightenment than he would have had in Africa ; he 
is, as a general rule, treated with kindness ; he is protected from want in sickness and old age, and is, on the whole, better off, safer, happier, than he would have been in his native country. 
</p><p>
2. But in the second place, with the moral character of the act bringing the slave to this country we have now nothing to do. We find him here ; the thing is done. So far as the slave-trade is concerned, we have acted on that, and abolished it. Slavery was introduced in other times and under other auspices. It existed when the Government was established; an institution which could not 
be got rid of which had of necessity to be tolerated. Slaves had been made property in the Colonies by British law. The Government found it au existing 
institution, and the Constitution left it so of necessity, imperative and uncontrollable to be enacted on exclusively by the States, subject to the moulding 
and changing and controlling opinions and consciences of those concerned. These have not been inactive. In many of the States the institution has been 
abolished ; in others, meliorated ; in all, it is a question for opinion and conscience to act upon. As the General Government has no power to abolish it, 
so it has no power to prevent any State from abolishing it. 
</p><p>
3. In the third place, every considerate man. sees that in the present condition of things slavery cannot be immediately and absolutely abolished. We 
must reason about things as they are not as we might wish them to be. The slave is property; he became so by a law of our common ancestors ; he was left 
in that condition by the law of our common fathers who founded the Republic. 
The burden of this purchase should be borne in all justice, equally by our citizens, and we are not ready to pay the price. But, if we were ready, he is not in 
a condition to take care of himself. He has not the culture, the training, the experience, necessary to self-dependence. And where is he to go? No reflecting 
man is prepared to say he is willing to have three millions of slaves turned loose in the States, to fill the prisons and poor-houses and alms-houses of the country, 
or to live by plunder on the community. What, too, is to be his lot for the future in such a case? Is he to live in our midst as a marked and degraded 
being, through all time, or are we prepared to place him on an equality with us, civilly and socially. Are we ready for amalgamation? 
</p><p>
There seems under those circumstances to be a necessity for his continuance at present in the condition in which he is placed. 
</p><p>
In the fourth place, the hand of Providence seems to be clearly pointing out an ultimate design in all this arrangement of things. Yonder is Africa, with her 
one hundred and fifty millions of miserable, degraded, ignorant, lawless, superstitious idolaters. Whoever has stood upon her sands, has stood upon a continent that has geographical and physical peculiarities which belong to no other 
of the great divisions of the globe. The latter appear, upon the face of them, to 
have been adapted to draw out the energies of the natives in their inequalities 
of temperature, soil, and surface, inviting the ingenuity and enterprise of man 
to overcome them, and in the varieties of their products tempting the inter 
changes of commerce ; thus affording ample encouragement to the progress of 
civil and social improvement. But Africa is still, as of old, a land of silence and 
of mystery. Like the interminable dreariness of her own deserts, her moral 
wastes of mind lie waiting for the approach of influences from abroad. No 
savage people have ever advanced to a civilized state without intercommunication with others. All the continents of the world have, in their turn, been occupied and civilized by means of colonies ; but in no one of them did it appear so 
inevitably necessary, from, a previous examination of circumstances, as in that 
of Africa. It is plain to the very eye that Africa is a land to which civilization 
must be brought. The attempt has been made over and over again, by devoted 
missionaries and others, to penetrate that land and seek to impart the blessings 
of civilization and Christianity to her savage hordes. But the labour has been, 
spent in vain. The white man cannot live in Africa. The annals of the Moravians, of Cape Colony, of Sierra Leone, of Liberia, contain the records of the 
sacrifice of some of the best men that have lived to grace the pages of any 
people's history, in the vain attempt to accomplish something for her redemption through the instrumentality of white men. Who, then, is to do this work
</p><p>
Let now any calm, reflecting spectator of the present state of the world be 
asked to look at Africa, and then, from among the nations, point out the people 
best calculated to do this work ; and when his eye falls upon the descendants of 
the sons of that continent now in America, will he not say, These are the people 
appointed for that work
</p><p>
The ways of God are mysterious. So Joseph was sold a slave into Egypt ; so 
his father and his brethren were driven thither by providential circumstances; 
so their generations remained as slaves in Egypt for four centuries and a half; 
and, when the appointed time had come, in His own appointed way the Ruler 
of nations led them to the accomplishment of His great purposes. And it is not to be forgotten that it was not the act of holding this people in bondage for so 
many years, that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were punished ; but their crime 
was this : that when the Divine Being had prepared all things for the event he 
proposed to accomplish, and demanded, by an accredited ambassador, that they 
should be allowed to depart, they would not let the people go. 
</p><p>
The great progenitor of the Israelites was a slaveholder ; the Israelites, after their emancipation, became slaveholders. Nothing is clearer than that under 
the Mosaic dispensation slavery was lawful ; the institution was recognised and regulated by the law of Moses; and the founder of Christianity and his disciples (though Judea and all the provinces of the Roman empire were in their 
times full of slaves, and slaves subjected to the most rigid laws) never forbade or even denounced the relation as sinful, or exhorted masters to liberate their 
slaves ; but enjoined on masters the principles of humanity and justice, and on slaves obedience and contentment ; and those notions of morality may well be 
questioned which in our days disallow what Christ and his apostles did not disallow. 
</p><p>
Such an Exodus as that of the Jews from Egypt may not be within the purpose of the Deity in relation to the children of Africa now in this country, or 
their descendants. But has He no purpose in all this arrangement that has been 
going on, in the gathering of a vast family of these people here, in their condition of servitude, endurance, discipline, in the difficulties with which their 
emancipation is surrounded, in the natural impossibility that the whites ever 
will or can consent to raise them to a condition of equality? No purpose in 
casting their lot in a country so free for the interchange of opinion, and where 
opinion is so enlightened and progressive and there is so much benevolence and 
Christian enterprise? Has he not a purpose in all this, to accomplish (in some 
way of his own, through this instrumentality) the regeneration of the millions 
of benighted Africa? The germs of colonies are already planted there as the 
fruits of this system of servitude. But the free African among us clings to 
this country still, under all his disabilities, regardless of the claims of the land 
of his fathers upon him ; and may not slavery and the necessity of migration as 
the condition of his release be the appointed instrument to produce compliance? 
The colonies we have settled in Africa would, ere this day, have become a Re 
public of power, had the free negroes of the North been willing to become citizens of it. But, like the Israelites of old, who would, but for the Divine inter 
position, have sacrificed their liberators in the wilderness and returned into 
Egypt, these liberated descendants of Africa cannot be persuaded to look towards 
the land of their fathers. The millions of their coloured bondmen there waken 
no sympathy in their hearts. Their fixed and resoluted purpose appears to be 
to remain among the whites and force themselves by progressive steps into a 
civil and social equality with them ; and it is chiefly with a view to strengthen 
themselves in these particular views and aspirations, that they band together 
under the abolition flag, and fill our cities with threats of vengeance against the 
white race if they shall dare to execute the laws in relation to fugitive slaves. 
</p><p>
Now, when we came to reflect calmly and candidly upon all these circumstances, in connection with the question, Is domestic slavery, as it exists at the 
South, a sin? it seems to me that question must be answered in the negative. The relation of master and slave may be, and doubtless is, sometimes the occasion of cruelty and injustice. But this is also true of the relation of husband 
and wife, parent and child, master and apprentice, and of employer and employed in our system of labour. But the abuses of a system or relation form no sound argument against the system or relation itself. I am no apologist for 
abuse. I am as ready as any man to denounce cruelty, unnatural separations, a disregard of the domestic relations, or a deprivation of the means of moral and religious culture to the slave, under our system of slavery, as a crime. But the 
correction of these belongs to the duties of the State Governments. We, in New Jersey, have no more right to interfere with South Carolina than she with us, in such matters; nor in fact have we in New Jersey any more right to interfere 
with the slaves of South Carolina or Georgia than we have with the slaves of Russia or Austria, each Southern State being, in respect to this question, as absolutely sovereign as are Russia and Austria. We are to reason about the 
institution of slavery as we reason about every other human institution, from its proper, humane, conscientious and lawful use, when both parties discharge their mutual obligations. 
</p><p>
Having established, as I think, that domestic slavery, as it exists in the Southern States, is not in itself sinful or an unmitigated evil, this subject is relieved from its greatest embarrassment; and now I proceed to consider : What is 
the duty of the people of non-slave-holding States respecting Slavery ? 
</p><p>
Shall we attempt forcibly to break down this institution of slavery ? To make the attempt is : 
</p><p>
First. To violate the Constitution and its compromises. I care not whether 
under colour of inferential instruction assuming the Constitution to imply the 
power of interference (which, by-the-way. I unconditionally deny) or acting 
regardless of it. In either case it is, at best, the appeal to the mere majority 
power, acting upon and forcing the minority. 
</p><p>
Second. It is to attempt the liberation of the slave, and fail. For by the effort 
the most we can do is to drive the South with its slaves out of the Union without 
liberating a single slave; and, 
</p><p>
Third. It is to compel a dissolution of the Union. Have the people considered 
the consequences implied in this branch of the alternative? Suppose, after all, 
that, in opposition to the plain teachings of the Bible and the judgment of God's 
holiest men, they still hold that slavery is in itself sinful, and the owners of slaves 
are men-stealers, robbers and pirates, then, indeed, this question assumes a more 
serious aspect, and Mr. Calhoun may no longer be denounced as either unpatriotic or extravagant in calling for an amendment of the Constitution, or any 
other means that will secure his constituents from imminent peril and his posterity from the calamities of civil war. But 
</p><p>
Is there not, in this view, a crime of deeper and redder dye, in marching over a desecrated Bible and a broken compact to shed oceans of fraternal blood? Is 
it lawful, on their own principles, to do evil that good may come even if good could by it be accomplished? If they succeed in driving the South to a secession, they inevitably kindle the fire of a conflagration which will burn over this whole 
Republic until it reduces to ashes the structure which Providence has for centuries been preparing and rearing up on this continent ; and, in the conflagration, their own homes and hopes will be mingled with the sacrifice. 
</p><p>
One great principle, says Dr. Channing, which we should lay down as immovably true, is, that if a good work cannot be carried on by the calm, self-controlled, benevolent spirit of Christianity, then the time for doing it has not 
come. God asks not the aid of our vices. He can overrule them for good, but they are not the chosen instruments of human happiness. But if we would adopt, as I sincerely do, the other alternative that with the institution of 
slavery as it exists in the South we have nothing to do that we are not only prohibited by the Constitution from meddling with it, but that it is a question of conscience to be settled by Southern men for themselves a question upon 
which good men may differ, and must be left to differ if they will, whether in the North or South a new train of thoughts, a new field of benevolent and Christian enterprise, opens before us. Going back to the great truth from which 
we started, and regarding all the circumstances of the present state of things as a part of the design of Providence to accomplish a great result for Africa, there is a work, and a great work, for us to do. Let the great heart of Christian 
benevolence in the North and the South unite in selecting from this vast African family this nursery planted and growing on our shores the proper subjects to be sent upon the mission of redemption to the land of their ancestors, until the 
last slave shall have departed, and Africa's long night shall have been dispelled by the sun of freedom and civilization. The philanthropist will find here enough to do to satisfy the largest benevolence, in acts, in personal sacrifices, 
in contributions to the cause of humanity, without the violation of personal or legal rights doing good that good may come. 
</p><p>
Let the General Government, then, retrace its steps; and instead of provisos, and compromise lines, and agreements to keep up the balance of power, fall 
back upon the literal construction of the Constitution adopt the principle of total non-intervention, now and forever leaving the laws of nature and the voice 
of public opinion to adjust the limits of the institution, free, uncontrolled, and uninfluenced by the action of Congress, and all will be safe. The Gordian knot will be dissolved not cut and the ark of the covenant, with its sacred deposit, be borne on safely to its destination. 
</p><p>
The measures, in short, which I would propose, are 
</p><p>
1st. A declarative act, in such form as may be deemed proper, that the Constitution gives no power to the General Government to act on the subject of 
domestic slavery, either with respect to its existence in the States, the Territories, or the District of Columbia. 
</p><p>
2d. The most efficient act that can be framed to enforce the provisions of the Constitution in relation to fugitive slaves. 
</p><p>
3d. That California, in consideration of the peculiar circumstances of her case, be admitted without the approval or disapproval of that part of her Constitution which relates to slavery. 
</p><p>
I believe these three positions, carried out, would settle the question forever. They involve no concessions no compromise; they are no temporary expedient. They put the solution of the difficulty on the eternal principles of right the 
law of the Constitution. 
</p><p>
I think the great majority of the North and South are prepared to place it there, and, having placed it there, to stand by and maintain the Union at all hazards. 
</p><p>
I feel that I have already trespassed too long on your patience. But it is a subject of vast importance, and I cannot close this letter without a few general remarks in reference to the foregoing views. 
</p><p>
At such a time all good men will forbear, exchange opinions, and reason in the spirit of conciliation. 
</p><p>
Conscientious differences of opinion among men will always exist in relation to moral questions. 
</p><p>
Some conscientious men believe slavery to be a sin; other conscientious men 
believe that the law of property which enables one man to hold what they insist 
is the common gift of the Creator to his creatures, is sin. Again, still, other 
conscientious men hold that to take a glass of wine is sin ; and so on, through an 
endless variety of subjects. 
</p><p>
If these conscientious opinions, or any of them, pervade the majority, are all 
who do not hold them to be driven with fire and sword out of the Union, or 
compelled to yield their opinions, equally conscientious, to the majority? These 
notions are inconsistent with a wise moderation ; they come from an abuse of 
reason in the first place, and a proposed abuse of power in the second. 
</p><p>
Such arguments are always drawn principally from the excesses of a system, rather than from the system itself, and there lies the error; it is the error of 
fanaticism, which always puts in the plea of conscience, whether it burns the supposed heretic at the stake, or hunts down witchcraft, or impales the Nestorian, or fans the flame of civil war. 
</p><p>
Instead of railing with infuriated declamation against a system because of 
its excesses, which are incident to every human institution, we should calmly 
and dispassionately seek to extract the truth from the general rule rather than 
from its exceptions. The system of slavery, like every human system, has its 
excesses its exceptions from the general rule. But it is quite probable that 
there may exist in the one, as in the other, an absolute law, which is working 
out a beneficent result. If a man wishes to fall under the delusion of a universal fanaticism, it is only necessary that he adopt the method of looking at 
the special attendants of every system to the exclusion of the general law which 
regulates them, and the work is done; while he is intent with some accident of 
the train, the train itself has long since passed on, leaving him to grow more 
and more inflated with conceit, indignation, unholy zeal, and misanthropic rail 
ing, all the natural results of so narrow-minded a procedure. Let every man 
run off with particular features out of the general complexion of any subject or 
thought, and gaze at those features long enough and absorbingly enough, and the best thing within the range of human experience will become to him a bug 
bear. The individual, however, who neglects the great law of compensation 
in judging of human affairs, has only to apply the same method of judging to 
himself; and, passing by his redeeming qualities and looking only at his own 
excesses and defects, he will find in himself, if he is honest in the search, enough 
to satiate his appetite for condemnation and hate. It is far easier to condemn 
than to judge correctly far easier to get into a passion about a subject than to 
get a comprehension of it.

The idea that out of the institution of domestic slavery in this country is to 
spring the regeneration of Africa, derives, it seems to me, great force from the 
recurrence to past history. 
</p><p>
We invariably find that, in the dispensation of Providence, nations which have 
been called to act an important part in the work of human progress have been 
led through a long previous discipline of trial; the restraints and endurance of 
youth have preceded the power and efficiency of manhood. Primary subjection 
is the law of stable growth, and seems an indispensable condition of the advancement of our race. 
</p><p>
We have only to look back through a few centuries to find the evidences of 
this in the annals of our race.. Our ancestors were for centuries a down-trodden, 
enslaved, and toiling people. The Anglo-Saxon race have become what they are 
by a long training in the school of patient endurance; in the case of England, 
under oppressive servitude to the Roman and the Norman ; in the case of America, 
under the oppression of our mother-country and the trying discipline of Colonial 
suffering. In the life of a nation, hundreds of years may be as a day in the life 
of an individual. It is often necessary for many generations to pass, before a 
new influence can be made to affect the mass. If all were willing, the work of 
national preparation might be more rapid; but thousands are to be made willing, 
and by the providential adaptation of the means to the end. 
</p><p>
It is conceded, on all hands, that the probation of the African people now in bondage on our shores is to come to an end. 
</p><p>
That, while there is an interchange of benefits between the parties, there is at the same time a community of evil, which renders it better, both for the whites and the blacks, that it should come to an end. 
</p><p>
When shall that time be? is the great question before the American people. 
</p><p>
In seeking an answer to this question, we may be sure there is some safer ground on which to take our stand than that of political chicane, of fanatical prejudice, or of any merely temporary or prudential expediency. 
</p><p>
If slavery is to be abolished now, then it is to be done in a moment. That is 
to say, at one stroke a community of three millions of people, habituated to a 
certain way of life, are to be thrown into new circumstances: a thing plainly 
preposterous, because no kind of society changes its customs suddenly and succeeds in doing well. Great changes in society must come in with previous preparation, or they come in to little purpose. Seven years sufficed to fight the 
battles of the Revolution, but many more were spent in preparation for that 
event, and many more will be required to perfect its results. If Providence 
rules in the affairs of nations, the existence of slavery has some prospective 
purpose, only to be accomplished by prior preparation for it. 
</p><p>
Let us not be impatient or presumptuous. These African people are passing 
to their destiny along the same path which has been trod by other nations, 
through a mixture of hardship, of endurance, but in a land of light and amid 
a civilized society. They are preparing to accomplish a work for their native 
continent which no other people in the world can accomplish. Their plain 
mission is ultimately to carry the gifts of society, of religion, of government, 
to the last remaining continent of the earth, where these blessings are totally 
unknown. Their work is a great one, as it would seem to be connected essentially with the final and universal triumph of civilization and Christianity in 
the world. It is our duty to follow, not to attempt to lead in the ways and purposes of Providence. We are to move forward when the pillar of fire and cloud moves forward, and to rest when it rests. 
</p><p>
Doubtless there is a time for action; but it is characteristic of all great changes that they make known their own seasons. That time, in the present instance, has not yet come for the manifest reason that the way is not yet open 
for it. When the time shall come, the way will come with it, the preparations for it be complete. The North settled this question easily, quietly. Surely, it 
is no great stretch of charity for us to suppose that in due time the same thing will be accomplished in the South. We of the North have given no peculiar 
evidence of superior goodness, that we should suppose the South not to be possessed of as much justice, charity, and good sense, as ourselves. 
</p><p>
I firmly believe that the hour for the complete enfranchisement of the Southern Slave will be the hour of the complete preparation for the work of African 
redemption and civilization ; and that hour will make itself known in the removal of all obstacles here and there, in the preparation of the workmen and 
the work ; and I earnestly hope that guided by happier influences than seem now to pervade the country, the pulpit, the press, the people of the North and 
the South may give their thoughts and efforts to this subject in the spirit of Him whose mission to our earth was heralded by the proclamation of peace and good-will.

With great regard, yours,
