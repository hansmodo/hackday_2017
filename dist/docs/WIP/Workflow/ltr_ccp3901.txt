HONORED MADAM : 
</p><p>
No attack has been made upon us yet, and from the strange conduct 
of the gentry in Five-Fathom Hole, I don t know when to expect one. 
One man-of-war and seven transports went out of the harbor this 
morning; they sailed to the north-east, but I can now plainly see them 
lying at anchor on the other side of the bar. They are certainly much 
weaker than they are generally reputed to be, or their councils are 
much divided, or they would not have conducted their affairs in the 
dilatory manner they have done. If they postpone their attack till 
Monday, and I do not imagine it is in their power (such has been their 
conduct) to attack us before that time, we shall be in exceeding good 
order for them at every outpost and also in town. If they should how 
ever visit us to-morrow, I believe they will heartily repent it. You 
would scarcely know the environs of the town again, so many lines, 
bastions, redans, and military mince-pies have been made all around it, 
that the appearance of it is quite metamorphosed. All the houses on 
the wharves are pulled down, so that the town looks from the water much 
handsomer than it ever did. Every person there is obliged to work j 
and the tories (reluctantly I believe) now work with the rest. General 
Lee appears very clever, but is a strange animal ; however, as Adams 
said, we must put up with ten thousand oddities in him on account of 
his abilities and his attachment to the rights of humanity. Do give 
my love to my sister and Dan, and my compliments to Mrs. Elliott, 
W. Gadsden and all at Sandy Hill. Col. Gadsden is well and desired 
me to acquaint you that he begs his compliments to you all and is 
much obliged to you for the care of his son. My brother is well and I 
remain

Your dutiful son,
