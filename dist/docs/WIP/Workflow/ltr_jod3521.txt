I WISH you a happy new year and many happy years, 
and all the blessings of life. Who knows but this 
year may be more prosperous for our country than 
any we have seen ? For my own part I have hopes 
that it will. Great blessings are in store for it, and 
they may come this year as well as another. You 
and I, however, must prepare our minds to enjoy the 
prosperity of others, not our own. In poverty and simplicity we shall be happy, whenever our country is so. 
Johnny sends duty. Mr. Williams waits. I knew of 
his going but this moment. I think I shall see you 
this year in spite of British men of war. If it should 
be otherwise ordered, however, we must submit.
