SiR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th, ordering me to proceed in the Congress to the 
Sandwich Islands, &c. &c. ; and also the sealed orders which I am not to open till I am beyond the capes of Virginia. 
</p><p>
The following expression in your letter of the 17th So soon as the United States frigate of which you have volunteered to take command, in connection with the sealed package, has given 
rise in my mind to some reflections that prompt me to recall to your remembrance, in the most humble and respectful manner, the circumstances under which I felt constrained, by every principle of 
patriotism and personal honour, to accept or volunteer for the command of the Congress. 
</p><p>
Having performed, in the best way I could, the duty assigned to me in Texas, I returned to the United States, to bring the glad 
tidings- of annexation, and to explain to you my views (the importance of which I no doubt overrated) in regard to our relations with Mexico. During those conversations I stated to you that I thought 
Mexico would probably, when ready, commence hostilities. You suggested that it was important to have the Princeton back in the Gulf as soon as possible, that a constant and certain communication 
might be kept up with Vera Cruz ; and mentioned Commander Engle as the officer whom you thought of ordering to command her, 
and ordered me to make the necessary arrangements to fit out the Constellation. My only desire was to do as you wished, and to be 
ready, with a good ship under me, to take part any part in the expected conflict in the Gulf. I was satisfied with the Princeton ; 
I applied for no change ; I suggested none. But, as you wanted the Princeton as a tender to Commodore Conner, and offered me the Constellation in her place, I was still better pleased, because I 
thought I was pleasing you and at the same time would have a ship larger, stronger, and more effective even, than the Princeton, and that I would then be ready for war, come from where it might. 
You changed your notions, and ordered me to proceed no farther with the Constellation. The Princeton had gone to the Gulf, and I was a volunteer idler on shore, having left a cruising ship at a time 
of threatened hostilities. To relieve myself from this painful situation you offered me no facility, and I saw no way open but to apply to fit out the Congress or some other ship. If you had time to 
give to my poor character and position a few moments consideration, I am sure you would appreciate the feelings which prompted me to ask to fit out the Congress, and would not suppose for one 
moment that I could have volunteered to command the Congress as she now is, with sealed orders and twelve passengers- men, women, and children. My great object in the first place was to be 
prepared, in the event of a war with Mexico, to try to do something creditable to the navy. If Mexico did not make war, I wanted then to get a ship ready for England, that might be able to keep 
the station to which she was ordered, and not to go cruising about with passengers in time of peace, and in war to run away (as the Congress must necessarily do) from the English squadron in the 
Pacific. They not only have a much larger squadron, led by an eighty-gun-ship, but have means of communication which will enable them to receive their despatches months before we can. 
</p><p>
But here I am ; and, whatever that ominous-looking package may contain, and wherever I am ordered to go, or whatever I am ordered to do, by the leave of Providence there I will go, and that I will do, in the best way I can. 
</p><p>
Faithfully, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. F. STOCKTON.

To the Hon. George Bancroft, 
</p><p>
Secretary of the Navy.
