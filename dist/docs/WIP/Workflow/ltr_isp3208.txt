DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am this moment returned from Fort Independence, and find 
the [intelligence concerning a] party of the enemy, which were 
said to have landed last night at that Fort, is without foundation. 
By the inhabitants, who live just by Fort Independence, I am 
informed that the enemy have landed betwixt King's Ferry and 
Dunderberg. If that is the case, they mean to attack Fort Montgomery by land, which when I am sure of, I shall immediately 
reenforce you.
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
