DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received the honor of your Excellency's favor of the 4th instant, and am very far from differing with you in sentiment, that the militia of the 
country should be drawn out by the authority of the 
Government, rather than by the pecuniary reward attached to their service. This has always been my 
opinion ; and I have used my utmost exertions to get 
our militia upon that footing ; but it is a thing rather 
to be wished than expected, as our Legislature have 
uniformly manifested a disinclination to use compulsion. And when it is considered that the five shillings per day which they have added to the pay of 
the militia, is not equal to what they have lately done for the standing troops, I flatter myself that it will not 
be attended with the disagreeable consequences which 
your Excellency apprehends. The truth is, the militia have, of late, been so extremely backward to come 
out in the monthly service, that, without some addition to their past allowance, it was universally apprehended that our frontiers would be entirely left to 
the mercy of the enemy. But, for the reason your Excellency assigns, I wish it had been by way of 
bounty, instead of augmentation of wages. 
</p><p>
The confidence your Excellency is pleased to place 
in my friendship affects me with inexpressible plea 
sure. I hope, Sir, you will never have reason to 
think it misplaced ; and your friendship, in return 
(which, indeed, so bought, is too cheap a purchase), I 
shall always consider is the greatest felicity of my 
life. The communication of your sentiments, in the 
freest manner, upon my public measures, I shall not 
only esteem an honor done me, as a convincing mark 
of your confidence, but shall ever endeavour to improve to the public emolument, which I am sure 
will be the only motive that suggests them. 
</p><p>
Please to accept of my acknowledgments for your promise of continuing the troops, or the principal 
part of them, at their present stations, a few days 
beyond the period limited in your former letter. 
</p><p>
Our political stupor and security, owing to our last 
year's successful campaign, and a thirst for the mammon of unrighteousness, is truly lamentable ; and I 
am entirely of your Excellency's opinion, that there 
is the greatest reason to believe, that a vigorous 
prosecution of the war is determined on the part of 
the enemy. The slowness of our progress towards 
completing our quota of your reenforcements, affects 
me with unspeakable chagrin. And I can assure 
your Excellency, that I do not lose a day, without 
exerting myself to accelerate the motions of some 
gentlemen, who ought not to wait a prompter to 
that indispensable measure. With every sentiment 
of esteem, I have the honor to be, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most humble servant, 
</p><p>
