MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MR. BROWN is here, and I cannot miss the opportunity by him to write you a line. I know not how 
often you receive letters from me, so many are taken 
or sunk ; but I write as often as I can. 
</p><p>
I have received some letters from you, which will 
occasion your name to be classed with Mrs. Macaulay and Madame Dacier, for aught I know. Johnny 
is very well. Stevens had a fall yesterday, which 
hurt him a little, but not very badly. He is in a good 
way this morning. The things enclosed, which were 
a present to me, you will do as you please with. 
Europe is the dullest place in the world. No news 
but the lies which the emissaries of England are 
making and spreading in every part. We get no 
news from Congress, or any part of America. By 
hints in some letters which I have heard of, I expect 
that the first vessel will bring us news of some new regulations of Congress concerning foreign affairs. It is 
said that Congress has determined to have but one 
commissioner at this court. If this is true, as I sup 
pose it is, as it comes from Mr. D., I am uncertain 
what is to be done with me. It is said that I am to 
be sent to some other court, and that the Doctor is to 
be here alone. If this should be the case, I should be 
puzzled what to do. The motives of Congress are 
very good to save expenses, but this motive will not 
have its effect, if I am to be maintained here in idleness, or sent upon my travels to other countries, 
where I shall not be received, which will be the most 
painful situation imaginable to me. In this case I 
should be at a loss whether to return home immediately, or wait until I could write to Congress and obtain leave. Some of my friends here are of opinion 
that I ought not to return without leave. I would not 
take any step that should give any just cause of of 
fence to Congress or the people. But I cannot eat 
pensions and sinecures. They would stick in my 
throat. I wish some honest vessel would arrive and 
resolve my doubts.
