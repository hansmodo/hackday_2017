MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
A VERY idle, vain conversation at a dinner has produced you this letter from a venerable old lady in 
this neighborhood, the wife of Monsieur Grand the 
banker. As the subject was introduced, and according to the turn the conversation really took, there was 
not so much vanity and ostentation on my part as you 
will suspect from her account of it. But as I speak 
French very imperfectly, and she understands not a 
syllable of English, I suppose she did not fully under 
stand me. All that I maintained was, that it was the 
duty of a good citizen to sacrifice all to his country in 
some circumstances. God grant, I may never be 
called to do this again so often as I have done already, 
for I have hazarded all, very often, and done as much 
as sacrifice all, sometimes. You will have a deli 
cate task to answer her. Write to her in English. 
She has a son about five and twenty, who is a master 
of English, and will interpret. It is a virtuous family, 
and very civil to me and my dear Johnny, of whom 
the whole family is very fond. 
</p><p>
We are in deep concern for America ; the last ac 
counts having left D Estaing going to Rhode Island 
and Lord Howe after him. 
</p><p>
It is high time for me to write to my children, but 
hitherto I have not had time. I hope you have received twenty letters from me, in which I have desired 
you to draw upon me for what money you want. 
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
