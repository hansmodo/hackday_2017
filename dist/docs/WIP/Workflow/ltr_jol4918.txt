My Dear Father: 
</p><p>
Some commercial technicalities puzzled me in the 
letters which you sent me to translate. My French 
acquaintance here are almost as much at a loss how 
to render the words in question, as much as I was my 
self; however, I believe the following explanations are 
right: fonsage, one of the articles of charge in the 
account sales, signifies, filling up, or packing ; it stands 
thus in the original, an tonnelier ponr fonsaye $ foneage, 
i. e., to the cooper for packing gabarage ; another charge 
is properly cooperage, or repairs to the cask. 
</p><p>
Livraison, another charge, means the delivery ; but I 
can t explain what delivery is to be understood, as it 
is unconnected with any other word. 
</p><p>
Babut & Labouchere in one of their letters say, 
" We are sorry the goods per Capt. Cochran were ovaries. 
The blank in this part of my translation is to be sup 
plied with the word averaged; the cargo, I suppose, 
received some damage at sea. 
</p><p>
In another letter, where they relate the prices curr , 
goudron means tar, and bray, I can only guess, means 
green tar, for it is placed among the productions of the 
pine tree, and it cannot signify pitch, for that is 
express'd by poix. I am exceedingly sorry that my 
ignorance in these matters has made me bungle so, but 
hope there will be no ill consequence arise from it. 
</p><p>
The continuance of your pains is a great affliction to me ; and if sympathy can alleviate, or prayers avail 
to remove the evil, the tenderness of the former causes 
the latter incessantly to now from 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>

Inclosed is a newspaper, which, though not of a very 
recent date, may afford you some amusement. The 
means which are taken in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to discredit the 
report of a French war, are to me, better proof in our 
favor, than many testimonies that are exhibited 011 
our part.
