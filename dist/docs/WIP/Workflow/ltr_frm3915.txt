SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the 17th ult. came to hand. The men lately came out 
from the enemy for six months duty. You must endeavor to seize Mrs. M's boat and negroes, and make prize of them, agreeable to the Governor's proclamation; a few men may do it easily. She has no 
pass from the Governor, <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, or myself, nor no other person; 
they wish a stop put to it. I have taken steps with Mrs. T . In respect to the regulation of trade, we must submit to superior power. 
I believe that scoundrel you mention has misrepresented to the Governor, I do not know any letters of yours I have not answered. Mr. Dillon, or any other Continental commissary, have nothing to do with 
the hides or tallow of the militia forces. Mr. Samuel Dwight is appointed by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> commissary of issues, for the port of George 
town, in the Continental line; White must act as commissary of purchases. I am sorry to see so few horses of your regiment to be had, 
out of so great a number. The officers must give a particular account 
how they are gone, or it can never be settled. Saunders is resigned. 
You certainly have a right to make what regulation you think proper in your corps. I shall march from here on Sunday for . The 
news is, that the Parliament have unanimously resolved that whoever 
advises the King to continue the war in America, shall be deemed a 
traitor and enemy to the country, and have petitioned him to discontinue the American war. His answer is, that he shall comply with the 
wishes of his Parliament. All the offensive ministers are put out, and 
Lord Rockingham is at the head of the administration, and it is expected 
peace will soon be concluded. The letter sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Leslie</a> to Gen. 
Greene proposes cessation of hostilities ; it is said this has taken place 
at the -Northward. It is believed that Count de Grasse and six ships of 
war were taken in the West Indies in the late fight; but the French 
and Spaniards have yet got the superiority of those seas. Please send 
the letters to Murrell, Allston and Long. It is necessary their companies should all be with you, to prevent the enemy from taking advantage when the troops are distant. I think there is little danger of the 
enemy attempting your post at this time. 
</p><p>
I am, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. Postell's men I shall take with me. Warden, Murrell and 
Long, will send you half of their companies.
