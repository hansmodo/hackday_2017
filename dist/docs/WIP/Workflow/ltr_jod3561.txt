MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
BEFORE this time I hope you have the happiness to 
see your daughter J out of all danger, and your son- 
in-law and your two grandchildren in perfect health. 
I have no letter from you since that you wrote at 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, and I cannot find fault, because this is the 
first I have written to you. We are all very well, 
and go on very well. We are all in a flurry with 
politics. Mr. Dalton and Mr. Strong are senators, 
and Mr. Lowell will be representative for the district 
of Suffolk, as is generally supposed. Mr. Varnum, 
Mr. Partridge, Colonel Leonard, Mr. Grout? Mr. Sedgwick or Mr. Lyman, Mr. Jackson, or Mr. Dane, 
or Mr. Goodhue, Mr. Thatcher or Colonel Sewell, are named for other districts. 
</p><p>
My love to our children, and respects and regards 
wherever you please. Don t be uneasy on account 
of your family here, nor in haste to come home before 
a good opportunity presents. I don t enter into any 
political details. My mind has balanced all circumstances, and all are reducible to two articles vanity 
and comfort. I have the alternative in my own power. 
If they mortify my vanity, they give me comfort. 
They cannot deprive me of comfort without gratifying my vanity.
</p><p>
I am, my dearest friend, yours forever, 
</p><p>
