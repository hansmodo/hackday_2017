MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
Six months have already elapsed since I heard a syllable from you or my dear son, and five, since I 
have had one single opportunity of conveying a line to you. Letters of various dates have lain months at 
the Navy Board, and a packet and frigate, both ready to sail at an hour's warning, have been months waiting the orders of Congress. They no doubt have their reasons, or ought to have, for detaining them. I must patiently wait their motions, however painful it is ; and that it is so, your own feelings will 
testify. Yet I know not but you are less a sufferer than you would be to hear from us, to know our distresses, and yet be unable to relieve them. The 
universal cry for bread, to a humane heart, is painful beyond description, and the great price demanded 
and given for it verifies that pathetic passage of sacred writ, " All that a man hath will he give for his 
life." Yet He who miraculously fed a multitude with five loaves and two fishes, has graciously inter 
posed in our favor, and delivered many of the enemy's supplies into our hands, so that our distresses 
have been mitigated. I have been able as yet to supply my own family, sparingly, but at a price that 
would astonish you. Corn is sold at four dollars, hard money, per bushel, which is equal to eighty at the rate of exchange. 
</p><p>
Labor is at eight dollars per day, and in three weeks it will be at twelve, t'is probable, or it will be 
more stable than any thing else. Goods of all kinds are at such a price that I hardly dare mention it. 
Linens are sold at twenty dollars per yard ; the most ordinary sort of calicoes at thirty and forty ; broad 
cloths at forty pounds per yard ; West India goods full as high ; molasses at twenty dollars per gallon ; sugar 
four dollars per pound ; bohea tea at forty dollars ; and our own produce in proportion. Butcher's meat 
at six and eight shillings per pound ; board at fifty and sixty dollars per week ; rates high. That, I sup 
pose you will rejoice at ; so would I, did it remedy the evil. I pay five hundred dollars, and a new 
continental rate has just appeared, my proportion of which will be two hundred more. I have come to 
this determination, to sell no more bills, unless I can procure hard money for them, although I shall be 
obliged to allow a discount. If I sell for paper, I throw away more than half, so rapid is the depreciation ; nor do I know that it will be received long. 
I sold a bill to Blodget at five for one, which was looked upon as high at that time. The week after I 
received it, two emissions were taken out of circulation, and the greater part of what I had, proved to be 
of that sort ; so that those, to whom I was indebted, are obliged to wait, and before it becomes due, or is 
exchanged, it will be good for as much as it will fetch, which will be nothing, if it goes on as it has 
done for this three months past. I will not tire your patience any longer. I have not drawn any further 
upon you. I mean to wait the return of the Alliance, which with longing eyes I look for. God grant 
it may bring me comfortable tidings from my dear, dear friend, whose welfare is so essential to my happiness, that it is entwined around my heart, and can 
not be impaired or separated from it without rending it asunder. 
</p><p>
In contemplation of my situation, I am sometimes thrown into an agony of distress. Distance, dangers, and O ! I cannot name all the fears which sometimes 
oppress me, and harrow up my soul. Yet must the common lot of man one day take place, whether we dwell in our own native land, or are far, distant from 
it. That we rest under the shadow of the Almighty is the consolation to which I resort, and find that 
comfort which the world cannot give. If He sees best to give me back my friend, or to preserve my life to him, it will be so. 
</p><p>
Our worthy friend, Dr. Winthrop, is numbered with the great congregation, to the inexpressible loss of Harvard College. 
</p><p>
" Let no weak drop Be shed for him. The virgin, in her bloom 
Cut off, the joyous youth, and darling child, 
These are the tombs that claim the tender tear, 
And elegiac song. But Winthrop calls 
For other notes of gratulation high, 
That now he wanders through those endless worlds 
He here so well descried, and wondering talks, 
And hymns their Author with his glad compeers." 
</p><p>
The testimony he gave with his dying breath, in favor of revealed religion, does honor to his memory, 
and will endear it to every lover of virtue. I know not who will be found worthy to succeed him. 
</p><p>
Congress have not yet made any appointment of you to any other court. There appears a dilatoriness, an indecision, in their proceedings. I have in 
<a href="/results.php?tla=jal" rel="acquaintance">Mr. Lovell</a> an attentive friend, who kindly informs me of every thing which passes relative to you and your 
situation, and gives me extracts of your letters both to himself and others. I know you will be unhappy 
whenever it is not in your power to serve your country, and wish yourself at home, where at least you 
might serve our family. I cannot say that I think our affairs go very well here. Our currency seems 
to be the source of all our evils. We cannot fill up our Continental army by means of it. No bounty will prevail with them. What can be done with it? 
It will sink in less than a year. The advantage the enemy daily gains over us is owing to this. Most 
truly did you prophesy, when you said that they would do all the mischief in their power with the forces they had here. 
</p><p>
My tenderest regards ever attend you in all places and situations. 
</p><p>
Ever, ever yours.
