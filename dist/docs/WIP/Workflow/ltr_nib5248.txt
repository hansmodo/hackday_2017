My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have been prevented by other occupations from saying to you that on examining the <a href='/results.php?city=louisville' rel='city'>Louisville</a> business, I found 
I could not consistently adopt your suggestion. It seems that out of 9 there are 4 gentlemen friendly to the administration. 
This is accidental, but I am glad of it, for the fact shows that 
there was no principle of exclusion that the business men were taken indiscriminately from all parties &amp; the division is sufficient to prevent any political partiality on either side, which, however, I believe neither side feels nor exercises. To 
introduce new members members so well qualified as those now there for the purpose of making any political balance, 
would be wrong in itself &amp; would expose us to the very imputation we wish to avoid of looking to party considerations. 
On the whole, therefore, I thought it better to let the business considerations prevail over politics. The only regret I feel is, 
that I had it not in my power to agree to what might per haps have gratified you.
