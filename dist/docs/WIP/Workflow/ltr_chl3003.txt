DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have written to you more constantly, but 
really had no means of conveying my letter. A Mr. 
Buchanan and Tolby, bound for head-quarters, will 
deliver you this. You will excuse the conciseness, 
as my time is short. The Governor and Captain of 
man-of-war had threatened perdition to the town if 
the cannon were removed from the batteries and 
wharves; but I ever considered their threats as a brutum fulmen, and even persuaded the town to be of 
the same way of thinking. We accordingly conveyed 
them to a place of safety in the middle of the day, 
and no cannonade ensued. Captain Parker publishes 
a pleasant reason for his passive conduct. He says 
it was manifestly my intention, and that of the New 
England men under my command, to bring down destruction on this town, so hated for their loyal principles ; but that he was determined not to indulge 
us, so remained quiet out of spite. The people here 
laugh at his nonsense, and begin to despise the menaces which formerly used to throw them into 
convulsions. To do them justice, the whole show a 
wonderful alacrity; and in removing the cannon, men 
and boys, of all ages, worked with the greatest zeal 
and pleasure. I really believe that the generality are as well affected as any on the Continent, The Provincial Congress have ordered on fifteen 
hundred minute-men. A number equal to two battalions are coming from Pennsylvania and the Jerseys. 
Lord Stirling's regiment is already here, but not 
complete. When the major part, or a sufficient number, arrive, we shall begin our works. My intention 
is to pull down that part of the fort on the town 
side, to prevent its being converted into a citadel for 
the enemy, and to erect a battery on a traverse in 
the street, to prevent their making a lodgment in it. 
A redoubt and battery at the pass of Hell Gate will 
prevent their ships and tenders passing and repassing 
to and from the Sound. 
</p><p>
We have fixed on a -spot in Long Island for a retrenched camp, which I hope will render it impossible for them to get footing on that important Island. 
As this camp can always be reenforced, it is our intention to make it so capacious as to contain four 
thousand men. The batteries on the pass of Hud 
son's River will be secured as soon as possible. Some 
of the heavy cannon from hence must be sent up for 
the purpose. It is really a fine train we are in possession of. You shall have a return of the guns as 
well as stores by the post. 
</p><p>
Captain Smyth is an excellent, intelligent, active 
officer, and I take the liberty of commending him to 
your protection. Captain Badlam, of the artillery, is 
likewise a man of great merit in his way. You 
must pardon me, dear General, for a liberty I have taken. You know that Sears was to collect our volunteers in Connecticut, but he thought he could not 
succeed unless he had some nominal office and rank. 
I accordingly, most impudently, by the virtue of the 
power deputed by you to me (which power you never 
deputed), appointed him assistant Adjutant-General, 
with rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, for the expedition. 
It can have no bad consequences. The man was 
much tickled, and it added spurs to his heat. He 
is a creature of much spirit and public virtue, and 
ought to have his back clapped.

With respect to the Canada expedition, which you 
indirectly propose to me, I have only one answer to 
make. Wherever I can be of most service, there I 
should choose to be. I have, indeed, just at this in 
stant, one objection, which is, I am not without apprehensions that facing the cold may throw me into 
a relapse, so as not only to render me unfit for service there, but everywhere else. I am, indeed, much 
better, but extremely tender. I begin to walk it 
has been a d d attack; a constant violent fever 
attending it. I neither ate nor slept for eight days; 
but my fever is passed, and I begin to eat; a week 
I hope will set me up.

Several members of Congress have indicated a desire I should go to Canada. I have explained to 
them my apprehensions, but assured them most honestly of my willingness ; but, in fact, unless they Expedite an army, and some heavy artillery, it will 
be in vain to trouble their heads about a General. 
Colonel Richmore, who lately left Montreal, tells us 
that what few troops are HOAV there will infallibly

This word is so obscurely written, in the original manuscript, that 
it is difficult to decide whether it is heat, hat, or head. 
return home early in April. He is gone to the congress, and I hope will give them (as he is capable) the necessary lights 5 but whatever steps they 
take, ])e assured, dear General, that I am, with the greatest readiness, prepared to receive and execute 
your and their commands. Canada is, I confess, if I am only to be ably accoutred, a glorious field, which must flatter the ambition of
