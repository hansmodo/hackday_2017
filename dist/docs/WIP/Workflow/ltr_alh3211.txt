Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear confessing, that I am astonished and alarmed 
beyond measure, to find that all his Excellency's views have been 
hitherto frustrated, and that no single step of those I mentioned 
to you has been taken to afford him the aid he absolutely stands 
in need of, and by delaying which, the cause of America is put 
to the utmost conceivable hard. 
</p><p>
I so fully explained to you the General's situation, that I could 
not entertain a doubt you would make it the first object of your attention to reenforce him with that speed the exigency of affairs 
demanded ; but, I am sorry to say, he will have too much reason 
to think other objects, in comparison with that insignificant, have 
been uppermost. I speak freely and emphatically, because I 
tremble at the consequences of the delay that has happened. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a>'s reinforcement is probably by this time with 
Mr. Howe. This will give him a decisive superiority over our army. What may be the issue of such a state of things, I leave 
to the feelings of every friend to his country, capable of foreseeing consequences. My expressions may perhaps have more 
warmth than is altogether proper; but they proceed from the 
overflowing of my heart, in a matter where I conceive this Continent essentially interested. I wrote to you from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, and desired you would send a thousand Continental troops of those first 
proposed to be left with you. This, I understand, has not been 
done. How the noncompliance can be answered to General 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, you can best determine. 
</p><p>
I now, Sir, in the most explicit terms, by his Excellency's 
authority, give it as a positive order from him, that all the Continental troops under your command may be immediately marched 
to King's Ferry, there to cross the river, and hasten to reenforce 
the army under him. 
</p><p>
The Massachusetts militia are to be detained instead of them, 
until the troops coming from the northward arrive. When they 
do, they will replace, as far as I am instructed, the troops you 
shall send away in consequence of this requisition. The General's idea of keeping troops this way does not extend farther than 
covering the country from any little irruptions of small parties, 
and carrying on the works necessary for the security of the 
river. As to attacking <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, that he thinks ought to be 
out of the question at present. If men could be spared from the 
other really necessary objects, he would have no objections to at 
tempting a diversion by way of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, but nothing farther. 
</p><p>
As the times of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia 
will soon expire, it will be proper to call in time for a reenforcement from Connecticut. <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>Governor Clinton</a> will do all in his 
power, to promote objects in which the State lie commands in i&gt; 
so immediately concerned. Generals Glover's and Patterson's brigades are on their way down. The number of Continental troops 
necessary for this post will be furnished out of them. 
</p><p>
I cannot but have the fullest confidence you will use your utmost exertions to execute the business of this letter ; and I am, 
with great respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, 
</p><p>
