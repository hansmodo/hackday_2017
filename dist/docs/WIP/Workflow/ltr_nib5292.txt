Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . My own view of the whole matter is simply this. 
The projectives of this last assault on the Bank regret, and 
are alarmed at it but the ties of party allegiance can only 
be broken by the actual conviction of existing distress in the 
community. Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad 
will produce any effect in Congress. If the Bank remains 
strong &amp; quiet, the course of events will save the Bank &amp; 
save all the institutions of the country which are now in great 
peril. But if, from too great a sensitiveness from the fear 
of offending or the desire of conciliating, the Bank permits 
itself to be frightened or coaxed into any relaxation of its 
present measures, the relief will itself be cited as evidence 
that the measures of the Govt. are not injurious or oppressive, and the Bank will inevitably be prostrated. Our only 
safety is in pursuing a steady course of firm restriction 
and I have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and the recharter of the Bank. How 
soon this will take place, it is of course difficult to conjecture 
but I have little apprehension as to the ultimate result.
