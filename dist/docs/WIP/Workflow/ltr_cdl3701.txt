Sir, 
</p><p>
I flattered myself that the clothing, destined for 
the army under the command of your Excellency, 
had at length arrived in the river, in the vessel of 
Paul Jones, or in one of those coming under his 
convoy; but I regret that you have not yet had 
that satisfaction. A passenger, who arrived in one of 
this convoy, told me that when this little squadron, 
which left France on the 8th of October, should arrive, they would bring but little clothing, being in 
great part laden with arms and ammunition; but he 
added that the Serapis is destined to bring the 
remainder of the clothing, and that we may hope 
to see the vessel arrive soon in our ports. I am 
anxious to have an opportunity of giving your Excellency notice of the arrival of these articles. 
</p><p>
I have received certain intelligence that an expedition, composed of four thousand troops, convoyed 
by eight vessels of war, departed on the 16th of October from the Havana to attempt an expedition 
against Pensacola. But it is thought that the terrible tempests, which they may have experienced on 
the passage, may have retarded the fleet. 
</p><p>
Another expedition was to depart in the month of 
December, to attack St. Augustine. It was to be 
composed of ten thousand men, regulars and militia, 
and twelve vessels of war. I wish, sincerely, that the 
operation may meet with success, and thus make an 
advantageous diversion in favor of the United States 
in that quarter. 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Chastellux and the officers who 
had the honor of visiting you at head-quarters, desire 
me to present their respects to you. They hope to 
have the honor of seeing you again on their return. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
