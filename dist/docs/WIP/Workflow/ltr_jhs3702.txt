Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The lingering illness, which occasioned my leaving 
camp, still attends me. But notwithstanding my physical ills, I have undertaken the business of sending 
the recruits of this State to the army, and have detained several officers that were on furlough in the 
State, to conduct parties. I hope that this measure, 
which has every appearance to be for the public good, 
will meet your approbation. With this letter, I suppose you will be joined by about fifty levies. Between 
forty and fifty have already marched from Exeter, 
and I expect about fifty more will march, by the last 
of this week. 
</p><p>
A number of deserters have come voluntarily and 
delivered themselves up to me, since my arrival in 
the State. I could wish that their treatment might 
be as favorable as possible. I am persuaded, if an 
act of grace was published, a great number of soldiers, now prevented from delivering themselves up, 
for fear of punishment, would return to their duty 
with pleasure. 
</p><p>
I attended the General Assembly last week, and 
urged all in my power their exertions for filling up 
the quota of troops for the army ; and am happy to 
acquaint you, that I think they will do as well as 
their abilities will permit. It is entirely uncertain, when I shall be able to join the army ; but as soon 
as the situation of my health will justify the measure, 
I shall lose no time in repairing to my duty. In 
the mean time, that health may attend you, and success your glorious undertakings, is the ardent wish 
of, my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
