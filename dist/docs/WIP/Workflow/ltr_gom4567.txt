Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
My last letter was of the twenty-fourth of September. Since 
that period, I have passed through Flanders and a part of Germany, and having coasted the Rhine to Strasburg, came thence 
to this city. 
</p><p>
As I conjectured, so it has happened, that my longer continuance in London would have been useless. Spain finding from 
the revolt of the marine, and other circumstances, that whatever might be the intention, or rather wish, of France, no real 
aid could be hoped for from a country, where even the semblance of authority is gone, has submitted to the imperious demands of Britain. This is a great point in the general system. 
From henceforth, the benefits derived by Spain from her colonies must wither away, and if she should hereafter wage war 
to cancel an onerous compact, it is highly probable, that one or 
more independent monarchies maybe established in that large 
portion of the new world, which she now occupies. Nothing 
of this sort can be indifferent to us. In the great course 
of events, which divine Providence may have marked out, 
human wisdom can do but little, and to effect that little, we 
must approach as nearly as possible to our comprehension 
the view of futurity, and bestow on the present that cool 
consideration, with which every one can examine the deeds 
that were done in the old time before us. The independence of all America will place us forward as the bulwark of 
our neighbors ; and at the same time, it must loosen our hold 
upon Europe. I consider the several colonies to the south of 
us, as a pledge in our hands for the good conduct of those powers to which they belong. We now derive an influence from 
their reciprocal jealousies,, which we shall soon, I trust, secure 
by our own internal force. This subject opens a field too vast 
for present discussion, but it leads to another of narrower com 
pass, which we at present tread. 
</p><p>
England will not, I am persuaded, enter into a treaty with 
us, unless we give for it more than it is worth now, and infinitely more than it can be worth hereafter. Had they got engaged in a war, and could they in such war have obtained our aid. 
they would have paid high. But no price could, in my poor 
opinion, have compensated to us the ill consequences which 
must have followed. In proportion as her commerce with our 
neighbors becomes more extensive, and our naval force more 
evident, in that same proportion shall we find the advantage of 
being freed from any stipulations with her. A present bargain 
would be that of a young heir with an old usurer. Believing 
in our wants, she will impose terms which we ought not, cannot consent to. This, at least,, is my serious belief, A different idea may be entertained by others, who have better information, more experience, or clearer judgment; and the propriety of each opinion must be decided by the arbitrament of 
time. At present we may consider the western posts, which 
belong to us, as a part of what Britain means to give for privileges of trade,, which in her hands turn always to gold. This, 
which is very like buying us with our own. money, would enable the minister to go down to the House of Commons with 
perfect ease and self complacency. I am, &c.
