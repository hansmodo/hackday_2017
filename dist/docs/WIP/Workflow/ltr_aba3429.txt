MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
If, as the poet says, " expectation makes the blessing 
sweet," your last letter was peculiarly so. As you 
conjectured, I was not a little anxious that neither 
Captain Barnard nor Davis brought me a line. I was 
apprehensive that something was the matter, some 
imminent danger threatening some friend, of which 
my friends chose not to inform me until their fate 
was decided. I sent on board the ship ; the solitary 
box of meal was searched throughout. What, not 
one line from my dear sister Cranch, she who has 
never before failed me ? Can it be possible ? Uncle 
Smith did not, as usual, say in his letter, that all 
friends were well. Dr. Tufts, for the first time, 
omitted mentioning my children. That might be 
because he thought that thev had written. Thus was 
rav mind agitated until Captain Scott's arrival, who 
brought me your kind letter of May the 20th, but 
none from either of my nieces or children. Those 
dear lads do not write so often as I wish them to do, 
because they have nothing more to say than that they 
are well ; not considering how important that intelligence is to an affectionate parent. Mr. J. Cranch 
wrote to me soon after Barnard's arrival, and sent me 
an extract of a letter from Miss B. Palmer, with a 
particular account of the performances in April, at 
<a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, in which your son and mine bore a part. 
These young gentlemen are much indebted to her 
for her partiality and the very flattering manner in 
which she describes them. I hope they will continue to deserve the esteem of all good judges, and 
do honor to themselves and their countrv. The account you give me of the health of J. Q. A. is no 
more than I expected to hear. I warned him frequently before he left me, and have been writing him 
ever since. I hope he will take warning before it is 
too late. It gives me great satisfaction to learn that 
he has passed through the University with so much 
reputation, and that his fellow students are attached 
to him. I have never once regretted the resolution 
he took of quitting Europe, and placing himself upon 
the theatre of his own country ; where, if his life is 
spared, I presume he will neither be an idle nor useless spectator. Heaven grant, that he may not have 
more distressing scenes before him, and a gloomier 
stage to tread, than those on which his father has 
acted for twelve years past. But the curtain rises 
before him, and instead of Peace waving her olivebranch, or Liberty seated in a triumphal car, or Commerce, Agriculture, and Plenty, pouring forth their 
stores, Sedition hisses, Treason roars, Rebellion 
gnashes her teeth, Mercy suspends the justly merited 
blow, but Justice strikes the guilty victim. Here may 
the scene close, and brighter prospects open before us 
in future. I hope the political machine will move with 
more safety and security this year than the last, and 
that the new head may be endowed with wisdom sufficient to direct it. There are some good spokes in 
the wheels, though the master workmen have been 
unskilful in discarding some of the best, and choosing 
others not sufficiently seasoned ; but the crooked and 
cross-grained will soon break to pieces ; though this 
may do much mischief in the midst of a journey, 
and shatter the vehicle, yet another year may repair the damages. But to quit allegory, or you will 
think I have been reading Johnny Bunyan, the conduct of a certain gentleman ^ s rather curious. I 
really think him an honest man, but ambition is a 
very wild passion, and there are some characters, 
that never can be pleased unless they have the entire direction of all public affairs. And, when they 
are unemployed, they are continually blaming those in office, and accusing them of ignorance or incapacity, and spreading alarms that the country is 
ruined and undone ; but put them into office, and 
it is more than probable they will pursue the same 
conduct which they had before condemned. But 
no man is fit to be trusted, who is not diffident of 
himself. Such is the frailty of human nature, and 
so great a flatterer is self-love, that it presents false 
appearances, and deceives its votaries.

I have had with me for a fortnight a little daughter of <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson's</a>, who arrived here with a young 
negro girl, her servant, from Virginia. <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> wrote me some months ago that he expected 
them, and desired me to receive them. I did so, 
and was amply repaid for my trouble. A finer 
child of her acre I never saw. So mature an understanding, so womanly a behaviour, and so much sensibility, united, are rarely to be met with. I grew so 
fond of her, and she was so attached to me, that, 
when <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='friend met'>Mr. Jefferson</a> sent for her, they were obliged 
to force the little creature away. She is but eight 
years old. She would sit sometimes, and describe 
to me the parting with her aunt who brought her 
up, the obligations she was under to her, and the 
love she had for her little cousins, till the tears 
would stream down her cheeks ; and how I had 
been her friend, and she loved me. Her papa 
would break her heart by making her go again. 
She clung round me so that I could not help shedding a tear at parting with her. She was the favorite of every one in the house. I regret that such 
fine spirits must be spent in the wall of a convent. 
She is a beautiful girl, too.

This, I presume, is Commencement day. I dare 
say the young folks feel anxious. I don't know 
whether I should venture to be a hearer, if I was in 
America. I should have as many perturbations as 
the speakers. I hope they will acquit themselves 
with honor. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='friend met spouse'>Mr. Adams</a> desires me to tell cousin 
Cranch that any of his books are at his service. 
I believe we must send some of these young men to 
settle in Vermont. Can they get their bread in Massachusetts ? But " the world is all before them " ; 
may " <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> be their guide."

Your sister,
