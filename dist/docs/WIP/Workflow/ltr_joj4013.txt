Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Not a single line have you received from me since my 
arrival. This, you may say, does not look very friendly. 
I confess it, and, what is more in my favour, feel it. 
</p><p>
Business, I know, cannot excuse a total silence, though it 
may palliate a partial one. I won't plead it, for I never 
admitted it ; nor do I now write merely to keep fair with 
my own principles. Inclination, more than consistency, 
prompts me on this occasion. 
</p><p>
I presume your Legislature is by this time convened. 
Now is the season for exertion. Attend regularly. Confirm those who esteem you and their country. Convert or 
confound those who would sacrifice either to private views. 
Will any consideration induce you to visit another quarter of the globe ? I don't know that you will be called 
upon, but 1 am not sure that you may not. My conduct 
will be greatly influenced by your inclination. 
</p><p>
I had almost persuaded myself to write a letter to your 
brother Nod, urging him to come to this college, and offering my service to prepare the way for his reception. But 
as, on reflection, I apprehend it might stimulate him to a 
measure in which, perhaps, his mamma or brother might 
not concur, I decline it for the present. I cannot forbear, 
however, observing to you, that, in my opinion, his genius 
and his years call for a further degree of cultivation than 
can be obtained at Hurley. I wish to be useful to every 
lad of talents and cleverness ; and I assure you that desire 
will alwavs be increased, when these recommendations are 
possessed by one so nearly connected with a gentleman 
and a family who have particular claims to my esteem and 
respect. 
</p><p>
I am your friend, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P.S. Don't be too lazy or too busy to let me know how you do.
