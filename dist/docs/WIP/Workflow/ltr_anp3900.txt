SIR: 
</p><p>
By order of <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a>on, you are hereby required to embody the State draft from your company, and march with them, well armed and 
accoutred, with three days provisions, to the place where the Long Cane road crosses Little River, near the Rev. Mr. John Harris . You 
will be at the above place of rendezvous punctually on Friday, the 4th day of September next, as the situation of the distressed people in 
Georgia, to whose assistance we are to march, will admit of no delay. There will be wagons at the place where we meet, to carry the men's 
baggage, as the horses must be sent home if the men bring any from home. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=anp" rel="me">ANDREW PICKENS</a>.

N. B. Order every man to bring a good hatchet. Since I wrote the above I have got intelligence that a party of Indians are on their 
way to our frontier. I desire you would, with all possible speed, march up to John Cameron's old place with five or six days provisions.
