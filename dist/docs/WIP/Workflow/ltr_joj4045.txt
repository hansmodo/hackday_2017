Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Some of my letters to you have, I find, miscarried by the 
capture of the vessels that were carrying them : and there 
is reason to suspect that two others were stopped here, as 
the letters enclosing them did not reach the persons at the 
seaports to whom they were directed. 
</p><p>
I have heretofore mentioned the receipt of the picture 
you was so kind as to send me, by Mr. Ridley, and the 
arrival of your sons. I don't know the fate of that letter, 
and that uncertainty induces me to repeat my thanks for 
the one, and my congratulations on the other. The estimation in which I hold your friendship, and the marks I have 
received of it, interest me in every thing which concerns 
you and yours, and be assured that no opportunity of giving 
higher proofs of it shall be omitted. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay's time is much employed in nursing and amusing herself with her little girl. She is writing to Mrs. 
Morris. We are cheerful, and not unhappy, though distant 
from our friends, and deprived of the pleasures which result from that free and unreserved conversation which can 
only be indulged in the company of safe companions, or in 
a country like ours. 
</p><p>
We remove next week to Aranjuez, where I expect again 
to spend some agreeable weeks. It is a charming place, 
containing a tract of several miles in circumference, and 
divided into gardens, meadows, parks, cultivated grounds, 
and wilds, full of fine trees, fine roads, and fine walks, and 
watered by a slow winding river, which, if more clear, would 
be very beautiful. But still, my friend, it is not America. 
A genius of a different character from that which presides 
at your hills and gardens reigns over these. Soldiers, with 
fixed bayonets, present themselves at various stations in 
these peaceful retreats; and though none but inoffensive citizens are near, yet horsemen with drawn swords, guarding one or other of the royal family in their little excursions 
to take the air daily, renew and impress ideas of subjection. 
Power unlimited, and distrust misplaced, thus exacting 
homage and imposing awe, occasion uneasy reflections, and 
alloy the pleasing sensations which nature, smiling in such 
delightful scenes, never fails to excite. Were I a Spaniard, 
these decorated seats would appear to me like the temporary enchantments of some despotic magician, who, by reextending his wand, could at pleasure command them to 
vanish, and be succeeded by galleys and prisons. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more true, than that all things figure by comparison. This elegant seat being surrounded by exclusive 
wastes, appears like a blessed and fortunate island in a 
dreary ocean. The contrast heightens its charms, and 
every traveller arrives with a mind predisposed to admire 
and enjoy them ; but as the first impression wears away, 
and he begins to recollect the more happy, though less 
magnificent abodes in his own country, the attractions and 
allurements of this insensibly diminish. I have more than 
once experienced this, and though not difficult to please or 
be contented, vet I confess that I find little here that resembles, and nothing that can compensate for the free air, the 
free conversation, the equal liberty, and the other numerous 
blessings which God and nature, and laws of our making, 
have given and secured to our happier country. I would 
not be understood to insinuate, that good society and agreeable companions are wanting here. They may, perhaps, 
abound more in some other parts of the world, but they are 
also to be found here, though an unsocial kind of policy 
requires unceasing attention to the most austere rules of 
caution and prudence. The little that I have seen and 
observed of this people, induces me to think that (except 
the generality of those who compose the highest and lowest 
orders), they possess many qualities which are praiseworthy ; and that two or three long and wise reigns would 
make them a very powerful, and an amiable nation. But 
as I have not had sufficient opportunities of mixing with, 
and personally knowing many of them, time and further 
information may either confirm or alter this opinion. The 
evident suspense and indecision of the court respecting us, 
has kept many at a distance, with whom I should otherwise 
have been on a very familiar footing, and some of them 
have been so candid as to tell me so. This is a kind of 
prudence winch naturally grows out of a jealous and absolute government, under which the people have, for many 
generations, been habituated to that kind of dependence, 
which constrains every class to watch and respect the 
opinions and inclinations of their superiors in power. The 
prosperous tide of our affairs, however, has for some time 
past run so strong, that I think many of our obstacles here 
must soon give way. Shyness will then cease, and I shall 
not afterward find it difficult to be received into more of 
their houses, and that in the only manner I ever wish to be 
received into any â€” I mean, at the front door, by direct invitation from the masters of them, and without the precursory 
good offices of upper servants and unimportant favourites, 
whom I never can submit to court. Until this period arrives, I shall continue to cultivate the few acquaintances I 
have, and without giving offence to any, endeavour to 
increase their number, whenever it may be done with propriety and to advantage ; but I shall, as heretofore, avoid 
embarrassing and intruding upon those who, in the mean 
time, may think it necessary to be reserved. Self-respect 
joins with prudence in pointing out this line of conduct; and 
as I have no enemies of my own making, I am persuaded 
that instead of losing, I shall eventually be a gainer, by adheriag to it, especially as those who may have been led to 
ascribe this conduct to improper motives, will then immediately find themselves undeceived. 
Be pleased to present our compliments and best wishes 
to Mrs. Morris, and our friends with you.

I am, dear sir, with sincere regard, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend and servant,
