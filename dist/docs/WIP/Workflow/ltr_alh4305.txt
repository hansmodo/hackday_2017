Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Major Fairly is just setting out on a visit to you; 
I believe, on some business relating to the <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>. 
The Society of this State met some short time since, 
and took into consideration the proposed alterations 
in the original frame of the Institution. Some were 
strenuous for adhering to the old Constitution, a few 
for adopting the new, and many for a middle line. 
This disagreement of opinion, and the consideration 
that the different State Societies pursuing different 
courses, some adopting the alterations entire, others rejecting them in the same way, others adopting in 
part and rejecting in part, might beget confusion and 
defeat good purposes, â€” induced a proposal, which was 
unanimously agreed to, that a Committee should be 
appointed to prepare and lay before the Society a 
circular letter, expressive of the sense of the Society 
on the different alterations proposed, and recommending the giving powers to a general meeting of the 
<a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> to make such alterations as might be thought 
advisable, to obviate objections and promote the interests of the Society. I believe there will be no difficulty in agreeing to change the present mode of continuing the Society; but it appears to be the wish of 
our members, that some other mode may be defined 
and substituted, and that it might not be left to the 
uncertainty of legislative provision. We object, too, 
to putting the funds under legislative direction. Indeed, it appears to us, the Legislatures will not, at 
present, be inclined to give us any sanction. 
</p><p>
I am of the Committee, and I cannot but flatter 
myself that, when the object is better digested and 
more fully explained, it will meet your approbation. 
</p><p>
The poor Baron is still soliciting Congress, and has 
every prospect of indigence before him. He has his 
imprudences ; but, upon the whole, he has rendered 
valuable services ; and his merits, and the reputation 
of the country, alike demand that he should not be 
left to suffer want. If there could be any mode by 
which your influence could be employed in his favor, 
by writing to your friends in Congress, or otherwise, 
the Baron and his friends would be under great obligations to you. I have the honor to be, with sincere 
esteem. 
</p><p>
Your obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
