Dear General, 
</p><p>
Being convinced that our field-pieces were too light 
to make the wished impression on the block-house by 
Bull's Ferry, from an experience of more than an 
hour (at no greater distance than from fifty to seventy yards), during which time both officers and 
men evinced a degree of bravery seldom equalled, 
but never excelled ; and seeing the enemy in motion on York Island, and their shipping under way, 
together with certain accounts of the embarking of a 
very large body of troops from Valentine's Hill, it 
was unanimously determined, in a Council of War on 
the field, to withdraw the artillery, and fall back by 
easy degrees to this place, to prevent the disagreeable consequences of being shut up in Bergen Neck. 
We accordingly moved off, after burning the flats and 
boats lying at the landing, and driving the cattle 
from that country, which was part of our plan. Our 
loss is from fifty to sixty killed and wounded, whom 
we carried off, without the least molestation. I will 
have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency 
the particulars to-morrow. 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to mention, that the enemy 
are in full motion on the North River, chief part of 
their troops embarked. As they have completed their 
foraging in East and Westchester, may not good policy induce them to take p0st between the Liberty 
Pole and this place, in order to render that essential 
article very difficult for your Excellency to procure, 
in case of a siege ? I will shift my ground about 
two in the morning, and fall back towards the camp. 
Interim, I am your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
