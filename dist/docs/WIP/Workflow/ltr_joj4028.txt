Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
The pleasure given me by your letter of the 2d instant, 
may more easily be conceived than expressed. I am greatly 
obliged by your attention to my embarrassments. In my 
last on that subject which you received, was a copy of my 
letter to Count De Vergennes, from which it appeared that 
the sum I should have occasion for would probably be considerable, and far exceeding 25,000 dollars. Bills to the 
amount of 100,000 dollars have arrived. A loan cannot be 
effected here. What the court will do is as yet uncertain, 
and will long continue so. I should have replied to your 
letter before, but as I daily expected to hear from Count 
De Vergennes, I waited, with a view of mentioning the 
import to you. The enclosed copy of a note 1 received 
from Count Montmorin, contains all the advices I have on 
that head. My situation continues unpleasant, and though 
my endeavours are not wanting to better it, future events 
are too uncertain to be relied upon. To be active, prudent, 
and patient, is in my power ; but whether I shall reap as 
w T ell as sow and water, God only knows. 
</p><p>
I have often been told of the former supplies, and asked 
how they were to be reimbursed. My answer has uniformly been, that I knew neither their amount nor terms, 
and that I wished to be furnished with an account of both, 
Â»x:e. &c. As yet I have not been able to obtain it. 
</p><p>
Some mistake must have given occasion to any of the 
bills drawn on me being returned without acceptance. 
The fact is, that though I often delayed (with the consent 
of the holders), yet I never refused to accept any of them. 
</p><p>
I have written several letters to Congress, requesting 
them to forbear drawing further bills till proper funds should 
be established for their payment. Mere contingent assurances, or flattering inferences drawn from flattering expressions, ought never to be considered as a sufficient foundation 
for serious measures. 
</p><p>
Cornwallis, it seems, has cropped some of Gates's laurels : 
and Mr. Laurens is in the Tower. European politicians 
will, I suppose, though often deceived in the same way, 
again think America on her knees in the dust. Had Ternay been supported, the campaign would have had a different termination. Much money and spirit has been wasted 
by this disappointment. Of the latter, indeed, we shall 
never be in want, and I should be happy if the like could 
be said of the former. The conduct of France towards us 
has been friendly ; and though I cannot forbear to think she 
has been too inattentive to this object, my gratitude towards 
her is not impaired by it. I regret it as a misfortune, not 
blame it as a designed omission. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you last week, and now enclose a duplicate 
of another letter. You may rely on my reimbursing you 
the advances on account of our salaries, out of the first 
remittances I receive. 
</p><p>
I have often congratulated my country and myself on 
your being at present in France. I once expected to have 
seen you there, and to have profited by the lessons which 
time and much experience have taught you. Miracles have 
ceased, and my constitution does not promise length of 
days, or I should probably desire you, when you ascend, to 
drop me your mantle. That you may long retain it is one 
of the prayers of 
</p><p>
Your friend and servant,
