Sir, 
</p><p>
Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, 
respecting our Minister at Paris, I communicated it to the 
President of the United States ; and on the same day I had 
the honor of verbally informing you, that the President did not 
hesitate to do the reciprocal act, which was requested. From 
that moment to this, we have been anxiously seeking a successor, who may be as acceptable to the French Republic, as 
the successor of M. Genet is to our own. I beg you to accept 
this measure, as a fresh proof of our sincere desire to maintain 
friendship with your nation ; and to assure you, at the same 
time, that as no delay occurred, after the communication, which 
you have made, so would similar applications have been com 
plied with, on any occasion, and in relation to any person. I 
have the honor, Sir, to be, with perfect respect and esteem, 
your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
