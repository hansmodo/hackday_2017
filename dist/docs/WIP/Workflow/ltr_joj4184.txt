Sir, 
</p><p>
I received by the last mail your letter of the 19th inst. 
The circumstances mentioned in it cannot be regarded 
with indifference by those who wish you well ; and I feel as 
well as think so. 
It is not improbable, that doubts prevail respecting the 
design and tendency of the work you have in hand. The 
literary productions of Britain and America being interesting to each other, many are of opinion, and I concur in it, 
that the English language and its orthography should be 
the same in both countries. Apprehensions have been entertained that your dictionary would tend to impair that 
sameness ; and those apprehensions may, to a certain degree, have had an unfavourable influence. 
</p><p>
The progress of the subscription having been so long 
suspended, I think it better to enclose what I intended to 
subscribe, than trouble your agents at New-York with it. 
</p><p>
If any plan to render your prospects more promising, 
and in my power to promote, should be adopted, be pleased 
to communicate it to me. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
