DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I hope the measures you have taken will be effectual to the purpose of reenlisting the army, because 
it is an object of great importance; and I readily 
admit the propriety of first trying those methods 
which promise fewest ill consequences. Danger will 
only arise from pressing such too far, and urging 
the experiment too long. I very much fear, Sir, that 
the knowledge of depreciation has reached the most 
uninformed, and, therefore, that every evil which can, 
will happen to us from this cause. But I am not 
without hope that such measures will be adopted as 
may, before it is too late, restore our currency to its 
proper value. 
</p><p>
It is, indeed, no easy matter to judge of the designs of the enemy. They have created to themselves a great choice of difficulties. I "believe they would 
willingly change their war of conquest to one of revenge altogether ; but revenge must be postponed to 
safety. General Clinton's army is the only hope of 
Canada, Nova Scotia, the Floridas, the West Indies, 
and, I may safely add, much so of Great Britain and 
Ireland. Whilst this is the case, although <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, in 
its present situation, is a very tempting object, I can 
not think they will undertake it. However, what 
can be attempted, may be attempted, and wisdom 
points to precaution. If it be true, and our information comes pretty direct, that Dominica has fallen, 
that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in jeopardy, and that 
Keppel has fled from the fleet of France, we may sup 
pose that our enemies can make no long stay with 
us. Distance and land-carriage distress us greatly in 
the article of bread provision- to which is added an 
artificial scarcity, created in the midst of plenty, by 
an infamous set of engrossers, who have raised the 
price of flour from four dollars a hundred to five 
and six pounds. I hope the measures we are taking 
with these gentry will make them suffer in a way 
most hurtful to them. 
</p><p>
Mr. Eustis had quitted this city before your letter 
came to hand, and as he is gone to the army, I have 
inclosed the letter in this. I am, with much esteem 
and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant, 
</p><p>
