Sir, 
</p><p>
Such has been the state of my official business, and of 
that which arose from my long neglected private affairs, 
that, ever since the removal of Congress to this place, I 
have been obliged to trespass on my usual punctuality in 
private correspondences. Hence it happened that I have 
so long denied myself the pleasure of replying to your 
friendly letter of the 10th of January. Accept my warmest 
acknowledgments for the kind and very obliging manner in 
which you mention my services abroad, and permit me to 
congratulate you on the success of the application to Congress on behalf of Dickinson College, which you appear 
zealously to patronise. I consider knowledge to be the 
soul of a republic ; and as the weak and the wicked are 
generally in alliance, as much care should be taken to 
diminish the number of the former, as of the latter. Education is the way to do this, and nothing should be left 
undone to afford all ranks of people the means of obtaining 
a proper degree of it, at a cheap and easy rate. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the pamphlet you sent me. There is 
good sense and just reasoning in it. I wish to see all unjust 
and unnecessary discriminations everywhere abolished; 
and that the time may soon come when all our inhabitants, 
of every colour and denomination, shall be free and equal 
partakers of our political liberty. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with great respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
