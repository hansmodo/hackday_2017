MY DEAREST, 
</p><p>
MR. MURRAY, whom I am glad to see out again, will 
carry to Bath this memorandum, that we are all very 
well. He will arrive, for what I know, before Mr. Bridgen. The weather is very cold, but by a good 
fire and a good walk, I have not yet been obliged to 
recur to my expedient of an immaculate virgin bottle 
of hot water. I sent yesterday packets to Colonel Smith, from Paris. 
</p><p>
The news from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is very well. The court 
has set at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> in great pomp, guarded by three 
thousand men and a train of artillery. The General Court have passed an amnesty, with some exceptions, 
to all who will take the oath of allegiance in a certain 
time. The governor reviewed the troops and made 
them a speech. In short, government appears now 
in its majesty, supported by those in whom all majesty 
originally resides, the people. I have not seen the papers, but Colonel Trumbull gives me this account. 
Colonel Smith's toast, " Common sense to the common people," is already verified. 
</p><p>
Make your observations. Keep your journal, and 
make Abby Smith do so too, and let me see all when 
you return. 
</p><p>
Yours evermore, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='me'>JOHN ADAMS</a>.
