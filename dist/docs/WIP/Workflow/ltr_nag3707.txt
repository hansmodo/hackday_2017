Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens</a> is very anxious 
to join the Southern army, as soon as he gets exchanged. His knowledge of the Southern States, and 
of the customs and manners of the people, will render his services very necessary in that quarter.
</p><p>
Congress have passed a resolution authorizing me 
to make exchanges. I could wish to know your Excellency's intentions in this business, as it is my wish 
to regulate my conduct agreeably to your views. 
</p><p>
The arms we are likely to get from the Board of 
War and this State fall far short of my expectations. 
The whole will not exceed fifteen hundred. I must 
beg your Excellency, therefore, to forward us three 
or four thousand from the Eastern States, as it is 
impossible to get them here. We are not less deficient in cartouch-boxes than arms. 
</p><p>
I am apprehensive the difficulty of forming a large 
body of cavalry in Virginia, will be much greater 
than I imagined. I wish, therefore, if it was possible, the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion might be detached 
to serve with the Southern army, provided it can be 
done consistently with the views of <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>. 
The British might receive a deadly blow in Virginia, 
if <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=cdt' rel='colleague'>Admiral Ternay</a> would 
suddenly embark their troops, and land in Virginia. 
The enemy's fleet there is much inferior to that of 
the French ; and the land force of the former greatly 
inferior to the latter, when joined by the troops levying in Virginia, and the militia of the country. But 
this will be thought too hazardous, perhaps. 
</p><p>
I am, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
