Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency has heard of the shameful defection of the Pennsylvania line; and I am very much 
concerned to inform you that, as yet, there is no 
prospect, that we know of, of any desire appearing 
in them to return to their duty. I happened to be 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> the day the accounts of it arrived 
there, and set out early next morning, in company 
with the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, to make trial of what 
influence we might have; but, though we were suffered to come into <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, and there was an appearance of satisfaction in the countenance of the 
troops, we were not allowed to have any communication with them. A Committee of Sergeants, who are 
doubtless at the bottom of the whole, have got the 
business into their own hands; and no person is allowed to speak to the soldiery, but through them. 
</p><p>
Their demands are no less than an almost total 
dissolution of the line. They are, to the best of my 
recollection, â€” the discharge of all those who have 
been enlisted in the years <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> and '78, and who 
received the bounty of twenty and one hundred and 
twenty dollars ; immediate payment of their arrears 
and depreciation; and a general indemnity. <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, in answer to those demands, made them such 
promises as ought to have satisfied reasonable men, 
looking only for redress of grievances, whether real 
or imaginary ; but they were rejected ; so that I have 
no doubt but emissaries from the enemy are amongst 
them, and believe that nothing but force will reduce 
them to reason. Unhappily, however, there seems to 
be no disposition in the militia of this State to 
come to that method; and it was the opinion of the 
Governor, and such members of the Legislature as 
we saw at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, that they should be suffered 
to pass the Delaware. This I informed Governor 
Reed of, from that place, that he might have time to 
take the proper measures ; but they seem disposed 
to keep post at <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>. Whilst we were at the 
last place, <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Laurens</a> came up, and we very 
soon after received a notice that our being in town 
was very disagreeable, and desiring us, for our own safety, to retire; and our stay was afterwards limited 
to an hour and a half As we had no prospect of 
being of service, we set off, lest they should think 
of detaining us. We have since heard that they have 
made <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, Colonels Butler, and Stewart, 
prisoners ; hut the most alarming circumstance is, 
( their having organized themselves, and appointed all 
the necessary officers. 
</p><p>
There are still a few men at the huts, to whom I 
have sent this morning, with an assurance that they 
will he considered principally in whatever may be 
done for the line at large, and have directed that 
they may be collected and marched to Persipenny, to 
render their communication with the revolters more 
difficult ; and have given directions for removing the 
remaining artillery and ammunition to Luckysunny. 
</p><p>
We were unfortunate to miss Major Fishbourn, 
and have no knowledge of your Excellency's intentions. I thought it probable that you might have 
come down to this place. If that is not your design, 
I beg I may be favored with your Excellency's instructions; and am, with the greatest respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. I have not learned that any movements of 
the enemy indicate an intention to enter Jersey ; yet 
I cannot persuade myself that they will not endeavour to avail themselves of this disaster, though, perhaps, they may defer it until it is certain that force is necessary. 
</p><p>
After Major Fishbourn's departure from <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, 
from a desire expressed by the Committee to confer 
with some of the Council of Pennsylvania, <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a> sent an express to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, requesting some of that body to meet them. They were expected to arrive yesterday.

Sir, 
</p><p>
On the 22d instant I arrived at Williamsborough, 
in North Carolina, to which place I had gone, in advance of the troops (leaving them to be conducted 
from Petersburg by <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>), in order to 
settle the route it would be proper to pursue, and 
take the necessary measures for provisions. 
</p><p>
A report had prevailed for a day or two, that the 
enemy had evacuated Wilmington, and there I received such information respecting it as left no manner 
of doubt of the fact, which happened on the 14th 
instant; two large ships, which lay in the mouth of 
Cape Fear River, having taken the garrison on board, 
which no doubt are gone to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. This circumstance leaves me at liberty to take the most direct 
way to join <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a>, which I shall do with 
as much expedition as possible, by Salisbury, Charlotte, and Camden, which, though not absolutely the 
nearest route, is nevertheless, from the best information I have been able to procure, much the easiest 
and most plentiful, and by following which, time will 
be gained. As the evacuation would have taken 
place at all events, it is fortunate for the troops that 
it happened so early, as they would have been exposed to much difficulty in a march through a very 
barren country, intersected by many rivers that are 
not fordable. Whether I should reckon it fortunate 
for myself or not, I am not so certain. But I am 
always satisfied with what produces any advantage to 
my country ; and another State being freed from the 
power of the enemy, is a circumstance of no little 
importance, at this juncture. It has also freed me 
from an uneasiness that hung upon my mind, that I 
might probably find them so posted as not to have 
it in my power to dislodge them, and be reduced to 
the alternative of an uncertain assault, or that of 
leaving them unmolested. 
</p><p>
Since I sat down to write, a letter has come to 
hand from Colonel Febiger, by which I am informed 
that I can expect no part of the Virginia troops, as 
they are not in a condition to be marched at present 
It also contains the copy of a letter, or memorial, 
from the officers to him, on their being made acquainted with the orders I had sent for immediately 
marching to this place all the men that were equipped, which I take the liberty to inclose. It is too 
true that they have reason for complaint; but it 
pains me that they should take such means and such 
an occasion to express it ; and I was much surprised to see Colonel Posey's name to the memorial. I have 
written to Colonel Febiger, and taken no notice of 
The receipt of his letter, desiring him to halt the 
detachment I had ordered, until the whole can be 
got in readiness to march together, as it is now too 
late for them to join me, and, from a change of circumstances in North Carolina, not so necessary. With 
every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
