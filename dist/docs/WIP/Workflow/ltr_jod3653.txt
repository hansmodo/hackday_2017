THE SOLITUDINARIAN OF MARKET STREET 
</p><p>
TO HIS DEAREST FRIEND : 
</p><p>
YOURS of 25th ult. is received. Thomas is to set off 
from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to-day for <a href='/results.php?city=quincy' rel='city'>Quincy</a>, and I wish him a 
pleasant journey, which the fine weather and convenient snow promises. A happy sight of his friends 
will come of course without accidents. He found his 
father forty years older than when he left him, and if 
he finds his mother advanced only ten, it may be an 
agreeable disappointment to him. But if we should 
live ten years longer, I suppose we shall begin, like 
the hero of Prussia, to think ourselves young, at 
least not old. I rejoice that President Willard is re 
stored to his family, friends, and the public. Mr. Gerry has seen the communication and the annotations. I should be glad to know the public opinion of 
both. I shall not commit to writing any remarks 
upon the conduct of such great men as ministers of 
state and ambassadors. I agree with you that voluble old women or handsome young ones are the best 
ambassadors to some courts and governments. I wish 
some power or other would send you to me in the 
first character. 
</p><p>
Tell Mr. Porter that I wish to have the best manure upon the hill, and enough of it to give the land 
a good dressing.
