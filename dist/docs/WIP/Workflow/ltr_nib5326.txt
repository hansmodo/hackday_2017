My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You may readily suppose that we are not idle whilfcy &gt;/ 
this insane Sub Treasury scheme is urged forward to break] 
down all the great interests of the country and preparations are made to obtain from our legislature at Harrisburgh 
instructions to our representatives in Congress to oppose it. 
I learn from a friend who has just left me on his arrival from Harrisburgh to night, that the resolutions for that purpose 
were to be introduced into the House of Rep 3 this day. If so, 
they will be taken up on Monday &amp; if then passed will be 
sent to the Senate &amp; passed finally on Tuesday. 
</p><p>
I lose no time therefore in suggesting that you would keep \ 
up the debate in the Senate for a few days until the resolutions can reach you. I attach great importance to this measure 
as separating our State from these desperadoes, and the country looks to you eminently to exert your great powers as 
they have been so often before displayed for its protection.

On January 29, <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a>, Webster wrote to Benjamin D. Lilliman as follows: 
"We begin the proceeding on the S.T. Bill tomorrow. It will probably pass this 
House, without amendment, by 2 or 3 votes. Its fate in the other House is greatly 
doubtful. The decision on the Mississippi election is expected to day or to morrow. 
The Sub Treasury Bill may, perhaps, be a good (deal) dependent on the decision."
