Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I send by the packet the fruit of my negotiation — a treaty. 
I wish that I could go with it, as well that I might again be 
in my own country, as that I might answer questions on 
the subject. The draught has undergone several editions, 
with successive alterations, additions, &c. This shows 
that time and trouble have not been spared. I have just 
finished a hasty letter to Mr. Randolph. It will be thought 
slovenly, but I cannot help it. The packet must go. If I 
entirely escape censure, I shall be agreeably disappointed. 
Should the treaty prove, as I believe it will, beneficial to 
our country, justice will finally be done. If not, be it so — 
my mind is at ease : I wish I could say as much for my 
body, but the rheumatism will not permit me. Health and 
happiness to you, my good friend. 
</p><p>
Yours, sincerely, 
</p><p>
