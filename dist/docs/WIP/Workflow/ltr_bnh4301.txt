Sir, 
</p><p>
Prompted by the free and candid manner you expressed yourself in political affairs to me some days 
past, I shall, without reserve, communicate to you the 
reasons which induced me yesterday to vote for 
striking out the second section in the bill which I 
inclose to you. That I may be understood throughout, I must take a retrospect on Indian affairs for 
some years back. During the war, we acknowledged 
the Indians as brothers; told them of our difficulties 
and embarrassments, arising from our contest with 
Great Britain ; assured them of our disposition, though 
unable, to furnish them such comforts as they had 
been accustomed to receive; urged them to be patient; 
and declared that, when success crowned our efforts, 
they should be partakers of our good fortune. They 
w^ere then acknowledged to be possessors of the soil 
on which they lived. 
</p><p>
At the close of the war, being anxiously desirous 
of paying to our officers and soldiers as much of 
their well-earned dues, as was apparently within the 
view of the Government, we seem to have forgotten 
altogether the rights of the Indians. They were 
treated as tenants at wilL We seized on their lands, 
and made a division of the same, as possessing allodial right; allotted certain portions to the Indians for 
hunting grounds ; and did not even think of offering 
them compensation for any claims they might pretend 
to have to those reserved for other purposes of the 
Government. 
</p><p>
This doctrine, it might be expected, would he disliked by the independent tribes. It was so, and was 
complained of by them. It is the source of their 
hostility. However, we persevered in this doctrine 
till the treaty at Fort Harmar, in <a href='/results.php?year=1788'>1788</a>. At that 
period, the Government pursued different measures. 
The boundaries were recognized and established by a 
principle of purchase. Some of the now hostile Indians 
complained of the conduct of their brethren in ceding 
their lands. These complaints reached the Government, and Governor St. Clair was ordered to remedy 
the defects in some future treaty. But they would 
not attend to his invitation, and assigned, as a reason, that he only w^anted a relinquishment of their 
claims to their lands, and that they were unwilling 
to part with them. It was natural to expect, that, 
as from our conduct they conceived themselves deprived of what they deemed most precious, they 
would be in a state of hostility against us, and the 
more so, as the British in Canada were ready enough 
to misrepresent all our conduct, to furnish them with 
military stores, and for some purposes, arising from 
State or commercial jealousy, to encourage them. 
</p><p>
I read, at the last session of Congress, the painful 
detail of Harmar's expedition, and the measures proposed by the Secretary at War to retrieve the honor 
of our military reputation, and to restore peace. I 
acquiesced in the measures proposed, not because I thought them right, but because I was told that you 
approved of them, and that they would give efficacy 
to some pacific plans you had in contemplation. <a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> told the Committee of the Senate that 
the President had it in view to bring about a peace 
by other means than coercive. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel=''>General Schuyler</a> and 
some others declared they would converse freely with 
you, and could point out how peace could be obtained without the further effusion of blood. Since this, 
I know of no efforts made by the Executive to induce the Indians to come to an accommodation previously to the last defeat, except that of Gamelin, 
which was a feeble one, that of Procter, the Cornplanter, and one other, which failed from unforeseen 
difficulties. 
</p><p>
I thought, and still think, the means of communicating with them are abundant. At St. Vincent's, at 
Kaskaskia, and even in Canada, there are French, the 
favorites of these people, and friendly to us. While 
we contemplate the going into their country, we may 
bid adieu to peace. Their attachment to their native 
soil is such, that they will part with it but with their 
lives. The Miami may be convenient to us, but ruin 
to them to part with it. They may be circumscribed, 
for aught I know, with the western Indians and Canada, as the Six Nations are by their neighbours, 
and have no place of their own to retreat to. 
</p><p>
I shall make no remark on the defeat of the 4th 
of November. You are a military judge. I will only 
offer as my opinion that the Indians did not, nor 
cannot, exceed twelve hundred effective warriors. As 
soon as the military arrangements were before the 
Senate, I determined to examine more accurately than 
formerly what was proper for me to do. I applied to 
the Secretary at War for information on two points; 
first, whether the plan sent in was the result of your 
opinion, or of that of the War Office; and, secondly, 
whether, if it was committed, and the Committee applied for your opinion, it was likely you would give 
it. I understood his reply to the first to he, that it 
was the result of his reflections submitted to you, 
and by you to Congress. And as to the second, he 
thought you would not like to give an opinion. I 
then determined to exercise my own. I have a great 
respect for the War Officer, but he appears to me to 
be anxiously desirous of having a considerable standing military force. All his views, in my estimation, 
tend to that end. He is not alone in that opinion. 
We have some in the Senate, who say that such an 
establishment is necessary, nay more, indispensable 
to the preservation of liberty. To a disposition of 
this sort, I attribute the feeble efforts made to purchase a peace. Those at the head of affairs to the 
westward, were for war; all who are dependent on 
the department, are for war; this is their harvest; 
and the Indians are, to this moment^ wholly unacquainted with the real disposition of our Government. 
From the best view of our situation, to my understanding, I am for completing the present establishment, adding the cavalry mentioned in the Mil, and 
making adequate provision for such effective militia 
as may be called out, and enabling the Executive to 
employ such Indians as are friendly to us, and willing to aid us. The present establishment and cavalry, 
brought all of them for the occasion to a point, aided 
by suitable militia and the friendly Indians, under an 
officer of activity, will accomplish every wish I have 
on the subject, which, I confess, are not many. I am for peace; I am for the establishment of posts, not 
in their country, but in our own. As long as we 
attempt to go into their country, or to remain there, 
we shall be at war. Our finances are unequal to the 
expensive establishments contemplated by some. We 
can, with the force mentioned, gain by victory or 
purchase, a peace. We should be to blame to run 
any further risk of being insulted by the British. If 
they will not give up the posts, they will not quietly 
suffer an establishment in the neighbourhood of them. 
We are unable to take them and it is, thus circumstanced, better for us to be passive for the present. 
</p><p>
I beg you to be persuaded. Sir, that, although I 
write thus freely to you, it is to you only ; and 
that I hold it unbecoming in myself to write or speak 
any thing, that may lessen the respect due to the Government and every officer of it. I have the honor to 
be, most respectfully, Sir, &c.,
