DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have to acknowledge your Excellency's favors of the 16th and 17th instant. 
</p><p>
From your Excellency's known disposition to afford 
this State all the assistance which the circumstances 
of your troops will permit, I think the reasons assigned., in your letter of the 16th, against sending a detachment into Monmouth, have their weight ; 
and one is often obliged to make those applications 
against one's own judgment, for the satisfaction, and 
through the solicitations, of others. 
</p><p>
I am happy to find your Excellency concur with 
me in sentiment respecting the prisoners lately be 
longing to the British ship, stranded on our coast ; 
and I have acquainted Colonel Beatty that they are 
to be considered as the prisoners of this State, and 
to be delivered to the order of Mr. Boudinot, our Commissary. I am exceedingly pleased with the 
plan your Excellency proposes, in your letter of the 
17th, for suffering flag-boats to pass only once a month, except on extraordinary occasions. For the 
inhabitants of the States, who have no military business to transact, it is quite sufficient ; and the inconvenience of being delayed for that space of time, 
when such establishment is found necessary for the 
public good, ought to be, and by all true Whigs 
will be, cheerfully acquiesced in. Indeed, of all 
those who have applied to me for recommendations 
to the commanding officer at <a href='/results.php?city=elizabethtown' rel='city'>Elizabethtown</a>, to go to 
Staten Island or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, not above one in twenty 
appeared entitled to. that indulgence ; and many of 
them were as venomous Tories as any in the country. It is either from a vain curiosity (extremely 
predominant in women), cloaked with the pretence 
of securing their debts or effects, in which they 
seldom, if ever succeed ; or, for the sake of buying 
tea and trinkets (for which they would as soon forfeit a second Paradise, as Eve did the first, for the 
forbidden fruit), that they are perpetually prompted 
to those idle rambles. I have, accordingly, been 
very sparing in gratifying their requests ; but have 
often had the mortification to find that many of 
those whom I had denied, were, notwithstanding, 
successful in their subsequent addresses to the military officers, who, from a mistaken complaisance, 
seemed incapable of resisting the solicitations of 
those eloquent and pernicious vagrants. The men 
are still more seriously mischievous, and go with 
commercial motives, and to secure capital quantities 
of British merchandises. 
</p><p>
By a late law, our Legislature has made it penal 
for any of the inhabitants of this State to go into 
the enemy's lines without your Excellency's pass or 
mine ; and I am sure I shall not find myself disposed to grant any but in cases in which the principles of charity or humanity evidently appear to 
require it. 
</p><p>
I hope the capture of the thirty Dutch vessels by 
the enemy on their passage to the West Indies, on pretence of their being intended for America, laden 
with French goods, will animate their High Mightinesses to vindicate their rights, and protect their 
commerce. I have the honor to be, with the highest esteem, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
