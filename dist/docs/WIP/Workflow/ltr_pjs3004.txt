DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favors of the 15th and 20th in 
stant were delivered me last night 
</p><p>
I left <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> on Thursday, the 17th instant, 
and hoped to have returned in four days ; but, on 
my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, I received information, that a 
large body of Indians of the Six Nations were to be 
here on Tuesday last, and that my presence was indispensably necessary. I therefore attended, and on 
Wednesday the congratulatory ceremony was performed, and on Friday the treaty, agreeably to their 
request, was opened by them, by giving an answer 
to the messages that had been sent them by the 
Committee of this place. In this speech they anticipated part of what we had in charge to deliver them. 
Being (as we conceived) apprehensive that we should 
request them to take up arms in our cause, they explicitly declared, that, as it was a family quarrel, 
they would not interfere, but remain neuter, and hoped we would not desire more of them. 
</p><p>
We have not got above half through what we are directed to say to them, and, although 1 hardly know 
how to leave them, yet such is the nature of the intelligence contained in the papers, which I do myself 
the honor to inclose to your Excellency, I consider myself under the necessity of leaving the Indian business to my colleagues, and repairing immediately to the army. 
</p><p>
That Governor Carleton and his agents are exerting themselves to procure the savages to act against 
us,, I have reason to believe from the various accounts which I have received, but I do not believe 
he will have any success with the Canada tribes, 
though I make no doubt that he is joined by some 
of the more remote Indians, who, I believe, will assist him as scouts from St. John s. I should, there 
fore, not hesitate one moment to employ any Indians 
that might be willing to join us. 
</p><p>
I thank your Excellency for the honor you have 
done me in communicating to me your plan for an 
expedition into Canada. The inclosed information of 
fires, which corroborates not only the information of 
Major Brown (that contained in the two affidavits), 
but every other we have had, leaves not a trace of 
doubt on my mind, as to the propriety of going into 
Canada, and to do it has been my determined resolution (unless prevented by my superiors), for some 
time; and I have, accordingly, since my arrival here, 
requested <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> to get every thing in 
the best readiness he could, for that I would move 
immediately, weak and ill-appointed as we were; 
and I learn with pleasure, that he has, since the receipt of Griffin's information, ordered the cannon to 
be embarked, and he will probably be off from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> so soon, that I shall only be able to join him 
at Crown Point. Such being my intentions, and such 
the ideas I have formed of the necessity of penetrating  into Canada without delay, your Excellency will, 
easily believe that I felt happy to learn your intentions, and only wished that the thought had struck 
you sooner. The force I shall carry is far short of 
what I could wish. I believe it will not exceed 
seventeen hundred men, and this will be a body in 
sufficient to attempt Quebec with, after leaving the necessary detachments, (at St. John s, Chamblee, and 
Montreal, should we succeed and cany those places,) which would be respectable to keep an open and free communication with Crown Point, &c. 
</p><p>
Having now given your Excellency the time, force, 
and latest intelligence I have had, together with my 
opinion of the sentiments of the Canadians, I proceed 
to inform you of the enemy's strength, as far as I 
have been able to learn it; three hundred and fifty 
or four hundred at St. John s; one hundred and fifty 
or two hundred at Chamblee ; about fifty at Montreal; and one company at Quebec. These are regular troops, besides between three hundred and five 
hundred Indians, Scotchmen, and some few Canadians 
with Colonel Johnson at La Chine. Of this party the 
Indians that are at St. John's are a part. Whether 
any ships of war are at Quebec, I cannot say. As 
none have been mentioned to me, I am rather inclined to believe there are none. Should the detachment of your body penetrate into Canada, and we 
meet with success/ Quebec must inevitably fall into 
our hands. Should we meet with a repulse, which 
can only happen from foul play in the Canadians, I 
shall have an opportunity to inform your party of it, 
that they may carry into execution any orders you 
may give, in case such an unfortunate event should 
arise. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will be pleased to be particular 
in your orders to the officer that may command the 
detachment, that there may be no clashing, should 
we join. 
</p><p>
I shall leave orders at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> to forward all the lead that can be spared. 
</p><p>
Excuse these scraps of paper. Necessity obliges me to use them, having no other fit to write on. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to make my compliments to the gentlemen of your suite. <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> will be so good 
as to excuse my not answering his letter, as I really cannot find time. I am, dear Sir, with the most respectful sentiments, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
