Dear General, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 14th of August I had the honor 
to receive on the 7th instant, and am very thankful 
for the contents. You must, ere now, be convinced 
that Colonel Bowman's apprehensions were founded on 
certain intelligence, of an expedition intended against 
the forts on Kentucky. I have sent out parties to 
take cattle and grain from the inhabitants, and expect 
to obtain a considerable supply of flour, as the mills 
begin to have water sufficient to manufacture it; but 
the inhabitants disappoint us of getting beef, by driving their cattle into the mountains. And we have, at 
present, neither bread nor meat, but expect a small 
supply immediately. Captain Brady is on command. 
and Captain McIntyre has leave of absence to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; as soon as they return, I will express your 
Excellency's thanks for their conduct. 
</p><p>
In full confidence that a sufficient supply of provision would, sooner or later, be furnished for the 
troops in this district, as well as for such number of 
militia as policy or the exigencies of aftairs might 
render it necessary to call into action, T, with a view 
to cut off the Wyandots and other Indian towns that 
were very troublesome to our settlements, called fur 
a draft from the militia, at three different times, and 
was as often disappointed in obtaining provisions ; 
which, with the unsettled state of the boundary line 
between Pennsylvania and Virginia, has greatly discouraged the inhabitants, and, I apprehend, given a 
handle to the disaffected. I take the libert} to inclose 
copies of letters, lately received from Colonels Butler 
and McCleary, purporting some of the above facts. 
</p><p>
The Delaware Chiefs, with upwards of thirty warriors, are come to aid me upon an expedition ; but, 
as I have neither bread nor meat to give them, they 
will soon discover that it is not in my power to act 
offensively. They appear much dejected on account 
of the total want of goods, which they were promised 
in exchange for their peltry. 
</p><p>
Unless supplies of beef, &c. are procuring below 
the mountains, which I know nothing of, the troops 
here will experience great hardship before spring, 
and desertions will be very frequent. I have frequently represented to the Honorable Board of War 
the hardships of the troops, and am now informed by 
their Secretary that compulsion is tolerated by the 
Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for a 
temporary supply. I continue my inquiries respecting the strength of Detroit, and my intelligence is of a 
piece with that formerly communicated. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be. &c., &c., 
</p><p>
