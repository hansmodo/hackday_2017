DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you of the safe arrival of the 
gentlemen from Congress, in good health and spirits. 
</p><p>
At a Council of War, held this morning, it was agreed to fortify, at Richelieu and Jacques Cartier, two important posts, the 
last eleven, and the former fifteen leagues above Quebec ; also 
to set on foot and build immediately four row-galleys or gondolas, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, under my direction; and that Colonel Hazen have 
the overseeing of the workmen, procuring materials, &c., of which 
I make no doubt the Committee of Congress will advise you, as 
also our prospects and resources in this country, which are very 
slender. I hope no time will be lost in hurrying on provisions, &c. 
</p><p>
On my arrival here I sent Colonel Hazen to command at St. 
John s, <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, &c. I have this minute received a letter from 
Lieutenant-Colonel Buell, acquainting me of his being appointed 
to command at those places, and having orders to build a store 
house, for which there are no materials to be procured at present. 
I fancy you have not been apprised of the store-rooms at St. 
John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, which are capable of holding two thousand 
barrels of provisions, and want little repairing. 
</p><p>
We have engaged a number of French carpenters and bateau-men to be employed at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> under the direction of Colonel Hazen, who is so well acquainted both with the Falls and inhabitants of the country, that a more useful man could not be employed at those posts. Perhaps you will think best that Colonel Buell should remain at this place, or go down to Richelieu, where 
I apprehend he will be of the greatest service ; his want of the 
French tongue is a great hinderance to business here. 
</p><p>
I should be glad that the small hawsers and anchors at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> might be sent to St. John's for the gondolas; and if fifty 
or a hundred good seamen could be engaged out of the troops 
coming up, to man them, with proper officers to command them, 
it will forward the matter much. 
</p><p>
We have received no material advice from Quebec lately. Our 
last was the 24th ultimo, when our batteries were playing on 
the town. Expect soon to hear their effect. I am, very respect 
fully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
