Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
With great satisfaction I have the honor to inform 
you that, last evening, the Convention of this State, 
by a great majority, voted to ratify and adopt the 
new proposed Constitution for the United States ; yeas 
one hundred and twenty-seven, nays forty. With additional pleasure I can inform you, that the debates 
on this subject have been conducted with a spirit of 
great candor, liberality, and fairness, and the decision 
received with the universal applause of a numerous 
body of the people of the State, who attended the 
public deliberations of their Convention, and expressed 
their cordial assent, on the moment of decision, with 
a general clap. 
</p><p>
The great unanimity with which this decision has 
been made, and the liberality with which its previous 
deliberations have been conducted in this State, I 
hope will have a happy influence on the minds of 
our brethren in Massachusetts. Their Convention is 
now collecting, and will be favored with this information to-morrow. It may not be amiss to mention that, 
in the list of affirmants in this State, stand the names 
of all our principal characters, with the men of liberality, sentiment, and influence. 
</p><p>
Although not honored with the appointment as a 
Delegate (being, in my particular circle, under the 
cloud of Commutation and <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a>), I have attended 
the debates of this Convention from their beginning 
to the close, and have been amply compensated by 
the pleasure, the satisfaction, and instruction I have 
participated on the occasion. With all those sentiments of sincere cordiality and respect with which I 
have ever had the honor to address you, my dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I now have the pleasure to subscribe myself, &c., 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jht" rel="me">Jonathan Trumbull</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. While I take the pleasure of congratulating 
you. Sir, on this joyous occasion, I pray you to indulge my wishes in begging you to present my sincerest respects to Mrs. Washington, with my tender 
solicitations for her health and happiness. 
</p>
