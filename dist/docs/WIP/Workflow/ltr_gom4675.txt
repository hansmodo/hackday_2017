Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the sixteenth, twenty-second, and twenty-sixth of 
August were delivered to me at my ^country house on Saturday morning, the fifth instant. That of the thirteenth of June, 
mentioned in yours of the sixteenth of August, I have never received. I arrived in this city the afternoon of the fifth. I 
had an interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the eighth. He promised me to recall Genet immediately. I came home and transmitted that, which you had 
written for the purpose, with a note, of which a copy is en closed. 
</p><p>
I am busied about obtaining a proper successor, and taking 
measures to prevent for the future what you have lately experienced. I expect to find everything in good order by the 
return of your advice boat. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &ic.
