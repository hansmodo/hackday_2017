Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yours of the first of September reached me a few days ago. 
Accept my sincere thanks for the information it contains, 
which is precious and highly pleasing. 
</p><p>
I might comment on what you say respecting a print, which 
censures every measure of government, but you will readily 
anticipate all which I might say on that subject. I cannot 
give you such desirable intelligence respecting the state of 
things here, as I might have done if the late revolution had 
not taken place, because I find my intercourse of necessity suspended, and until I have orders respecting the new government I am bound to preserve a neutrality of conduct, so that I 
cannot as heretofore peep behind the scenes. Add to this, that 
there is at present no very certain march anywhere, each feeling himself obliged to deviate according to circumstances from 
the course which he might wish. I will attempt, however, to 
give you an abbreviation of the late events, and in my letters to Mr Jefferson, which may perhaps be communicated to 
the Senate, and at any rate from the gazettes preceding and 
subsequent to the tenth of August, you will be able to fill 
up the outlines of the sketch.

The late revolution has for its remote cause that excess in 
the human temper, which drives men always to extremes, if 
not checked and controlled. Fonts pr oximate cause it has 
the vices and defects of the late constitution, and particularly 
that an executive without powers was rendered responsible for 
events, and that a legislature composed of a single chamber of 
representatives was secured by every precaution, and under 
no control except some paper maxims and popular opinion. 
That the people, or rather the populace, a thing which thank 
God is unknown in America, nattered with the idea that they 
are omnipotent, and disappointed from necessity in the golden 
prospects originally held out to them, were under no restraint, 
except such as might be imposed by magistrates of their own 
choice. It resulted inevitably, that the executive must be in 
the power of the legislative, and this last at the mercy of such 
men as could influence the mob. 
</p><p>
By reducing the royal authority below all reasonable mea 
sure, the constitution makers had created a moral impossibility, that the people should believe the King sincere in his acceptance, even if it had been possible that he should without 
regret have beheld himself reduced from the first place allotted 
to man, to a state so low as to be exposed to insult from the 
lowest. It was evident then, that the constitution could not 
last, and in the overturn three things might happen, viz. the 
establishment of despotism, the establishment of a good constitution, or the institution of a democracy. The first under an 
able and ambitious Prince was inevitable. The second was 
extremely difficult, not in itself, but because the chiefs of different parties all found themselves committed to different points 
and opinions. The last was only a natural continuation of the 
progress of men's minds, in a necessary succession of ideas 
from the bill of rights. The advocates for republican government therefore had an easy task, although both to themselves 
and others it appeared difficult. 
</p><p>
From the moment that the second Assembly met, a plan was 
formed among several of the members and others, to overturn 
the constitution, which they had just sworn to observe, and establish a republic. This arose in part from the desire of placing themselves better than they could otherwise do, and in 
part from a conviction that the system could not last, and that 
they would have no share in the administration under such a 
pure monarchy. As they had a strong hold upon the lowest 
class of people, as the aristocratic and constitutional parties 
were at open war, as these last avowed openly their wish to 
amend, in other words, to change the constitution, which at the 
same time they assumed to venerate, it was not a difficult 
matter to assault a monarch, who adhered to that form which 
he could not be supposed to approve, and whose faults became 
daily more and more apparent. 
</p><p>
Add to this, that the court was involved in a spirit of little 
paltry intrigue, unworthy of anything above the rank of foot 
men and chambermaids. Every one had his and her little project, and every little project had some abettors. Strong manly councils frightened the weak, alarmed the envious, and 
wounded the enervate minds of the lazy and luxurious. Such 
councils, therefore, if perchance any such appeared, were approved but not adopted, certainly not followed. The palace 
was always filled with people whose language, whose conduct, 
whose manner were so diametrically opposite to everything like liberty, that it was easy to persuade the people that the 
court meant to destroy the constitution, by observing strictly 
the constitution. Some persons avowed the tactics, which 
from the moment of such avowal were no longer worth 
a doit. The King, whose integrity would never listen to 
anything like the violation of his oath, had nevertheless 
the weakness to permit those, who openly avowed unconstitutional sentiments, to approach his person, and enjoy his 
intimacy. The Queen was still more imprudent. The re 
publicans (who had also their plan to destroy the constitution 
by the constitution) founded on the King's personal integrity 
their operation to destroy his reputation for integrity, and hold 
him out to the world as a traitor to the nation, which he was 
sworn to protect. 
</p><p>
They in consequence seized every occasion to pass popular 
decrees, which were unconstitutional If the King exercised 
his veto, he was accused of wishing a counter revolution. If 
he sanctioned the decree, he was so far lost with those, who 
were injured by the decree, and of course became daily more 
and more unprotected. The success of his enemies was beyond their own expectation. His palace was assaulted. He 
took refuge with the Assembly, and is now a prisoner of state 
with his family. 
</p><p>
But now the ideas of revolt, which had been fostered for his 
overthrow, are grown very troublesome to those, who have 
possessed themselves of the authority. It is not possible to 
say either to the people or to the sea, so far shalt thou go and 
no farther ; and we shall have, I think, some sharp struggles 
which will make many men repent of what they have done, 
when they find with Macbeth, that they have but taught 
bloody instructions, which return to plague the inventor.
