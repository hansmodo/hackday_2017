MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THIS is the coldest day we have felt this winter, and 
H it were not for the hope I have of a letter from you 
to-morrow, I should freeze, for what I know, to-night. 
This month has been all unpleasant weather, but 
none severe. You have had a north-east storm, I perceive, which raised the tides, but I hope, brought 
in a fresh and abundant supply of seaweed. 
</p><p>
It is the dullest time we have seen this winter. No 
arrivals, no news from abroad, nor from any part of 
our own country. The treaty appears not, and when 
it will, no man can tell. Are we to wait here till 
May for it ? I won t. There is not the smallest 
reason for my waiting. I can, in no possible case, 
have any voice in its ratification, as two thirds of the 
senators must agree. Nor will any opinion or reasoning of mine have the smallest weight with any 
one of the senators. If I were disposed to wait, how 
long must I wait ? I am tired of reading and writing. 
My eyes complain ; I want exercise ; I must have my 
horse ; and I must be at home. You say I must stay 
a few days at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; but I shall be uneasy and 
impatient. No business, no books, no amusement, 
no society much suited to my taste. Good cheer is 
not enough for me. Balls, assemblies, hunting, are 
neither business, pleasure, nor diversion for me. 
What do you say, shall I resign my office when I am 
three-score, or will you come with me in a stage 
wagon, and lodge at a tavern in Fourth street ? I 
must contrive something new against next winter. 
The old routine grows too insipid. 
</p><p>
I shall never be weary of my old wife, however ; 
so declares 
</p><p>
Your affectionate husband, 
</p><p>
