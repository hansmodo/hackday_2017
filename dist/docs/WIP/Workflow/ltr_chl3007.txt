MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I most sincerely congratulate you, I congratulate 
the public, on the great and glorious event, your 
possession of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. It will be a most bright page 
in the annals of America, and a most abominable 
black one in those of the beldam Britain. Go on, 
my dear General ; crown yourself with glory, and 
establish the liberties and lustre of your country on 
a foundation more permanent than the Capitol Bock. 
</p><p>
My situation is just as I expected. I am afraid that I shall make a shabby figure, without any real 
demerits of my own. I am like a dog in a dancing-school. I know not where to turn myself, where to 
fix myself. The circumstances of the country, intersected by navigable rivers, the uncertainty of the 
enemy's designs and motions, who can fly in an instant to any spot with their canvas wings, throw me, or would throw Julius Caesar, into this inevitable 
dilemma. I may possibly be in the North, when, as Richard says, I should serve my sovereign in the West. I can only act from surmise, and have a very 
good chance of surmising wrong. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to grate your ears with a truth ; but must at all events assure you that the Provincial Congress of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> are angels of decision, when 
compared with your countrymen, the Committee of Safety assembled at <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>. Page, Lee, Mercer, and Payne are indeed exceptions; but from Pendleton, Bland, the Treasurer, and Company, libem nosy Domine! 
</p><p>
I shall not trouble you with a detail of the army, 
ordnance, stores; but compendiously say, that the 
regiments in general are very complete in numbers, 
the men (those that I have seen) fine, but a most 
horrid deficiency of arms, no intrenching tools, no 
guns (although the Province is pretty well stocked) 
for service. Had I only eight eighteen-pounders, I 
would immediately, at all events, take post on Craney Island, by which measure I should drive out the 
enemy, and exclude them from the finest and most 
advantageous port in America. I have ordered, with 
this view, the artificers to work night and day. If 
I succeed, I shall come in for a sprig of laurels. 
</p><p>
This essential measure might have been effected 
long ago, but the same apathy and oblique squinting 
towards what the milk-and-water people call reconciliation, the prodigious flattering prospect opened by 
the appointment of Commissioners, were strong arguments against the expense of gun-carriages and in 
trenching tools. 
</p><p>
But this is not all. They have distributed their 
troops in so ingenious a manner as to render every 
active offensive operation impossible. An equal number of their battalions are stationed on the different 
necks. They say, very acutely, that, as the expense 
is equal, the security ought to be equal. I cannot 
help persuading myself, that their object will be to 
take possession of <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, not only from its 
tempting advantageous situation, commanding, in great 
measure, two fine rivers, and a country abundant in 
all the necessaries for an army; but the possession 
of the Capital would give an air of dignity and decided superiority to their arms, which, in this slave 
country, where dominion is founded on opinion, is a 
circumstance of the utmost importance. Perhaps I 
may be mistaken, but, as the surmise is not irrational, I have called three regiments down the country. 
</p><p>
You will excuse, my dear General, the blots and 
scratches of this letter, for the post is just going out. 
By the next, I will inform you of the steps we have 
taken for the security of this place. I have been 
desired to recommend Colonel Grayson as a man of 
extraordinary merit. He sets out soon to make application to the Congress for an establishment. If 
we have, as we must, a Continental Hospital in the 
Southern Department, Dr. McClary, I suppose, will 
be the man to direct it. I need not mention his 
qualifications, they are so well known. I beg you 
will make somebody write to me from time to time. 
</p><p>
Indeed, I think I may modestly insist on Mr. Palfrey's pen being employed often in this service. 
Adieu, dear General. 
</p><p>
Yours, most respectfully and sincerely, 
</p><p>
