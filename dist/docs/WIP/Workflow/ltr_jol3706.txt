With the triumph of a republican, and the more 
tender emotions of one who sincerely loves his General, I congratulate your Excellency on your late providential escape. I congratulate my country, whose 
safety is so intimately united with yours, and who 
may regard this miraculous rescue of her champion 
as an assurance that Heaven approves her choice of 
a defender, and is propitious to her cause. In fact, 
all the ascendency that could be given by virtue, 
genius, and valor, would only have furnished a deplorable example of unfortunate merit, if, by the 
Divine interposition, you had not prevailed over the 
most impenetrable perfidy that has yet disgraced 
mankind. This happy event must inspire every virtuous citizen of America with new confidence, and 
transfix her enemies with awful terror. Andre has, 
I suppose, paid the forfeit which public justice demanded ; example will derive new force from his 
conspicuous character. Arnold must undergo a punishment incomparably more severe, in the permanent, 
increasing, torment of a mental hell.

I am waiting in anxious expectation of an answer 
from Captain Wallop, a man of great interest and 
credit among the British, who was indulged with a 
limited parole to negotiate my exchange by composition. Sir Henry Clinton's late sanguine expectation 
of success may have suspended business of this kind, 
and produced some delay j but I still derive great 
hopes from that quarter. I need not inform your 
Excellency how I have languished in so long a separation from you, and how anxious I am to assure 
you, in person, of the veneration and attachment of 
your faithful Aid.
