DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of the 4th, 5th, and 9th 
instant ; and you will see, by mine of the Vth, that 
I have detained General Warner's brigade. The New York regiments being annexed to General Poor's brigade, they are exceeding unwilling to be separated ; 
and I, knowing the disadvantages that would arise 
from their being here, have presumed, in some measure, to deviate from your Excellency's orders. Those 
regiments are principally composed of men whose for 
mer residence was within the enemy's lines ; and, the 
little time they were down in this quarter last summer, there was upwards of one hundred deserters from 
them, mostly to the enemy. We should soon lose 
the principal part of them here. Add to this, they 
have lately got some clothes and money, which puts 
them in a much better situation to march than most 
of the other Continental troops here. Besides all this, 
they began their march before I received your letter. 
This, Sir, has induced me to let them continue their 
route, and, in their stead, I have detained Wyllys's 
and Meigs's regiments, whose situation will by no 
means admit of their marching with that expedition 
which is necessary. Near one half of them without a 
shoe or stocking ; but a supply is soon expected. 
</p><p>
Colonel Charles Webb's regiment marched yester 
day. I have directed him to advise you of his route, 
by express, before he arrives. I shall be happy to 
find this step meets your Excellency's approbation. 
</p><p>
The inclosed is a copy of a letter from Colonel 
Hamilton to me, by which you will see that I am 
positively ordered to send all the Continental troops 
from here. This letter contains some most unjust and 
injurious reflections ; for I am conscious of having 
done every thing in my power to succour you as 
speedily as possible.
</p><p>
I shall go to <a href='/results.php?city=new windsor' rel='city'>New Windsor</a> this day to see <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a> ; and, until I have your orders, I cannot 
think of continuing at this post myself, and send all 
the troops away. If they should go now, I am confident General Howe will be further reenforced from 
this quarter. For, by deserters, spies, and every other 
corroborating intelligence, there is now on York Island 
the thirty-fifth, forty-fifth, fifty-second, and fifty-seventh, 
British, four regiments of Hessians, and one of Waideck Brown's, Fanning's, Byard's, Robinson's, Ilirlehy's, and Delancy's first and second battalions of new 
levies. Some say Fanning's is at Panlus Hook, though 
that is immaterial. On Long Island, there are none but militia, By information from General Dickinson,there are about one thousand on Staten Island. 
</p><p>
I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jht' rel='colleague'>Governor Trumbull</a> for a number of militia ; but I 
have my doubts whether they w T ill come or not, as 
they have been much fatigued this summer already. 
The Rhode Island expedition has been of no service 
to us. You have doubtless heard that it is dropped, 
and it is said about three thousand troops remain there. 
</p><p>
Mr. Colt has accepted his appointment as Deputy Commissary-General of Purchases. I have seen him this day. He informs me there are a number of 
cattle purchased, which shall be immediately for 
warded to you. Since I came here we have had 
near fifty deserters, some from all corps. I am, dear General, with much respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
