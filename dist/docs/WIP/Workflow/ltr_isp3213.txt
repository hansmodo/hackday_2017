SIR, 
</p><p>
By the inclosed copies, the originals of which were taken yesterday, on their passage to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, your Excellency will be able 
to form some judgment of the enemy's intentions, and what is 
best to be done, as far as circumstances will admit. Would it 
not answer a very valuable purpose to get the guns out of the 
row-galley that is scuttled in Esopus Creek, as they may be turned to the annoyance of the enemy, and prevent their getting 
possession of them? If your Excellency has no capital objection to the measure, I could wish that it might be carried into execution as soon as possible. 
</p><p>
I have this morning written to <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> for some heavy cannon on travelling carriages, with fixed ammunition, and Continental troops, which if I receive, I expect to be able to oblige 
them to retire below the chevaux-de-frise. Whenever the cannon arrive, you shall be advised" previous to any operation, in order 
that we may act in conjunction as much as circumstances will permit. I am, with great regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,
