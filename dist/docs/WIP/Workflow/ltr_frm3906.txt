SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the 12th came to hand yesterday, on my march here. I 
wrote you before respecting Brodrick and Moore, to take bail for their 
appearance at court, and good behavior. The Georgia refugees must 
do duty, if they have been in this State three months. No excuse to 
be taken for not doing duty. Let me know if the flag has sailed; and, 
if you have not discharged Howell and crew, it must be done immediately. Send me the calibre of the different pieces of cannon you have, 
that I may procure shot for them ; also, other articles which may be 
wanted. I wrote you yesterday by Col. Moultrie. 
I am, your humble servant, 
</p><p>

P. S. If you have any coffee and sugar, send a little by first oppor 
tunity. As you have rice and indigo, you may pay off small accounts, 
such as is enclosed.
