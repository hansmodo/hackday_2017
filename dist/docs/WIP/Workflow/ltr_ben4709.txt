MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have now before me all your late Letters, and shall answer 
them Article by Article. 
</p><p>
Captain Ourry din'd here a few Days since, and thanks you 
for remembring him, desiring his Respects to you and Sally, 
Mr. Strahan & Family, the same. I received the Bill sent 
by Mr. Potts, and suppose it will be duly paid. You will return him the Overplus. I wish I could take my Passage 
this time with Capt. Falkener. I was on board the other day 
with Mr. and Mrs. West, Mrs. Stevenson and Mr. Hopkinson, 
to drink Tea. 'Tis a fine Ship, and I think it not unlikely 
that I may go with him next time, as he is a very kind, good 
Friend whom I much respect. 
</p><p>
The Nocake proves very good, and I thank you for it. 
</p><p>
I am glad you go sometimes to Burlington. The Harmony 
you mention in our Family and among our Children gives me 
great Pleasure. I am sorry to hear of the Death of our old 
Friend Debbey Norris. She was a worthy good Woman, and 
will be miss'd. If I can in any shape be of Service to Mr. Francis, you may depend I shall do it, being much concern'd 
for his Misfortune. I am told the Affair is like to turn out 
better for him than was expected. I will have the Shades done 
as you desire. Sally Franklin is now in the Country with her 
Father. She is an only Child, and a very good Girl. 
</p><p>
I think you would like her, and her Father wishes I would 
take her over with me ; but I object to it, as the Care of educating other People's Children is a Trust too weighty for us 
as we grow old. He is still a Widower, & is between 40 & 
50. His Name is Thomas Franklin; how came you to call 
him Billy Franklin ? 
</p><p>
I receiv'd the Watch-Chain, which you say you send to be 
put to rights. I do not see what it wants. Mrs. Stevenson 
says it is too old-fashion 'd for Sally, and advises sending the 
Watch also, to be chang'd away for a new Watch & Chain. 
</p><p>
In your last Letters you say nothing concerning Mr. Bache. 
The Misfortune that has lately happened to his Affairs, tho' 
it may not lessen his Character as an honest or a Prudent 
man, will probably induce him to forbear entering hastily into 
a State that must require a great Addition to his Expence, 
when he will be less able to supply it. If you think that in 
the mean time it will be some Amusement to Sally to visit her 
Friends here and return with me, I should have no Objection 
to her coming over with Capt. Falkener, provided Mrs. 
Falkener comes at the same time as is talk'd of. I think too 
it might be some Improvement to her. I am at present 
meditating a Journey somewhere, perhaps to Bath & Bristol ; 
as I begin to find a little Giddiness in my head, a token that 
I want the Exercise I have yearly been accustomed to. I 
long to see you & be with you, being as ever, my dear Debby, 
your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
