Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
After lingering through the summer, I found my disorder 
gradually returning in the autumn. Since the middle of 
November I have been confined to the house ; but have as 
yet suffered less this winter than I did the last. At times, 
however, I seemed to be approaching that state, in which 
" a grasshopper is a burden.'' When I took up my pen, it 
was not because it was pleasant, but because it was necessary. The late tine weather has done me good. I have 
walked on the piazza, and breathed mild fresh air. I feel 
less relaxed, and think it probable that the spring will again 
relieve me. The " carpe diem" reminds me that I should 
take this opportunity of writing to you, and to a few others 
whom I have apparently neglected. 
</p><p>
From your letter I can perceive what your feelings have 
been and are. When afflictions make us wiser and better, 
they answer their purpose ; and they do so when they produce the acquiescence and resignation you mention. A 
traveller has great reason for regret, when a faithful and 
affectionate friend and companion leaves him on the road j 
but that regret is softened by the expectation of meeting 
again at the end of the journey. To you it will readily 
occur that we are all travellers ; some in coaches, others 
on foot ; some lodge in good inns, and others where the 
night finds them. Some press forward with an eye to 
" the promised land," while many others loiter and revel 
on the way, with as little concern about where they are 
going, as the horses by which they are drawn or carried, 
â€¢fee. &c. He did not speak much at random, who said, 
" The greatest miracle to man is man." 
</p><p>
Our political sky still continues to grow more and more 
dark and threatening. Whether the clouds will quietly 
disperse and disappear, or whether they portend a storm, 
is uncertain. The present tempestuous state of the world 
does not encourage us to expect a long season of uninterrupted fair weather. If peace has been and is in our 
power, it would be mortifying to be involved in war unnecessarily. There came forth with the French revolution a 
spirit of delusion, which, like an influenza, passed over and 
infected all Europe. Even our distant country has not 
entirely escaped. Great is the number among us, of whom 
it may be said, that, "Seeing they have not perceived, and 
hearing they have not understood." Delusions have their 
errands, and are sent for some purpose different from that 
of promoting unanimity and peace. But be these things 
as they may, it is a consoling reflection that He who rules 
all, rules wisely. 
</p><p>
I will now turn to a more pleasing topic. On conversing 
with a gentleman who visited me last summer, about the 
damage said to be often done to pear-trees by lightning, he 
observed that the damage in question proceeded, in his 
opinion, more frequently from disease than from lightning. 
That on seeing the upper branches of one of his pear-trees 
to be withering, he examined them often, and found them 
to be dying from the extremities downwards. After some 
time he took off all those branches below the mortification, 
cutting through sound healthy wood. The tree soon began 
to flourish. It put forth new and strong shoots, and has 
since been as thrifty as the others. 
</p><p>
Something a little like this happened last year in my 
garden. A frost took my watermelons when they were 
about as large as a marble. They turned black, and 
dropped off. The ends of the vines began to die, and continued to do so for some days. I then had the vines cut 
below the mortified part, and the whole well sprinkled with 
plaster. They recovered, and brought some, though not 
much fruit to perfection.. 
</p><p>
I believe that you and I derive more real satisfaction 
from attending to our vines and fruit-trees, than most conquerors do from cultivating their favourite laurels. 
</p><p>
At present I indulge the expectation of being able to bid 
a cheerful welcome to the spring, and to participate a little 
in the enjoyments of it, notwithstanding the wickedness or 
folly which may abound in high places. That you may 
share largely and for many years in these and other enjoyments, is sincerely the wish of, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
Your affectionate and obedient servant,
