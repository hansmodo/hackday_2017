SIR, 
</p><p>
As I did not hear from you this morning, and being  prepared to embark, I concluded you were still 
on this side, and therefore embarked, and landed 
about fifteen hundred men about two miles above 
Bristol. After a considerable number were landed, 
I had information from the Paymaster of Colonel Hitchcock's brigade, that you had crossed over from 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. This defeated the scheme of joining your 
army. We were much embarrassed which way to 
proceed. I thought it most prudent to retreat; but 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> was of opinion that we might safely 
proceed to Burlington, and recommended it warmly, 
lest it should have a bad effect on the militia, who 
were twice disappointed. The landing in open day 
light must have alarmed the enemy, and we might 
have been cut off by all their force collected to this 
place. We had intelligence, immediately afterward, 
that the enemy had left the Black Horse and Mount Holley. Upon this we determined to proceed to Burlington. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> and two other officers went on, from 
one point to another, till they came to Bordentown, 
where they found the coast clear. <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> and 
Colonel Coxe are now there, and we shall march, at 
four to-morrow morning, for that place. This information has induced me to proceed, though not quite 
conformable to your orders, which I received on the 
march this afternoon. If you should think proper to 
cross over, it may be easily effected at the place 
where we passed. A pursuit would keep up the panic. 
</p><p>
They went off with great precipitation, and pressed 
all the wagons in their reach. I am told many of 
them are gone to South Amboy. If we can drive 
them from West Jersey, the success will raise an 
army by next spring, and establish the credit of the 
Continental money to support it. I shall write to-morrow, I hope, from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhc" rel="me">JOHN CADWALADER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have two six-pounders, brass, and two 
three-pounders, iron.
