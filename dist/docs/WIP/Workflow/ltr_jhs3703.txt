Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I now acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 
the 25th ultimo, which was delivered a few days ago. I shall set out for <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> The beginning of 
next week, and on my passage shall hold a treaty 
with the Green Mountain Boys. But not having seen, 
or been acquainted with those turbulent sons of freedom, for several years, I am at a loss to determine 
my reception; but hope it will be such as shall tend 
to the general good. I shall endeavour to give you 
a more particular account on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>. 
</p><p>
My health is not fully restored, but perhaps competent to my new command. That the operations of 
the campaign may be such as shall render the American arms glorious in the eyes of the world, and the 
conclusion produce a peace, honorable and lasting, is 
the ardent desire of, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
