Sir, 
</p><p>
I have already had the honor of informing you of the good 
dispositions of the United States toward France, of which they 
are sincerely desirous of giving multiplied proofs. I have had 
the honor also of informing you, that during the last session of 
Congress, although heavy duties were laid upon wines imported from other countries, no addition has been made to the du 
ties paid by those of your country ; which amounts, in fact, to 
allowing them a premium from which they must derive a considerable sale. It is thus, Sir, that the American government, 
while employed in paying its pecuniary debt, endeavors at the 
same time to discharge that of gratitude. You may rely on 
its faithful exactness, and give the King this assurance. 
</p><p>
I should, however, but ill fulfil my duty to my country, and 
should give but a weak expression of the attachment, which I 
have so long entertained for your own, if I should attempt to 
conceal the discontent that has been excited in America by 
the decrees of the Constituent Assembly, which are inflicting 
a blow upon the system of commerce established between 
France and the United States before the year <a href='/results.php?year=1789'>1789</a>. I refrain from all observations on this subject, because I refer the 
whole matter to your wisdom, and to the sentiments of your 
nation, and I venture to believe, that even if their own interests alone were concerned, the National Assembly would not 
allow regulations to continue in force, which are still more oppressive to the French consumers, than they are injurious to the 
American ship-owners. 
</p><p>
There is another subject, Sir, to which you will certainly 
lend all the attention that its importance deserves. The Constituent Assembly expressed a wish, that the King should 
cause a new treaty of commerce to be negotiated with America. This was communicated to the President of the United 
States by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Majesty, but, hitherto, nothing has been the result of this project. lam instructed to assure you, that the United States will very cordially receive any overtures, that shall be made to them on this subject, 
and that they are desirous to establish this treaty on foundations that shall be just, firm, and reciprocally beneficial to the 
two nations. The Minister Plenipotentiary of France at Philadelphia is in a better condition, than any one else, to appreciate the advantages of such a treaty, and I venture to assure 
you now, that if he is intrusted by the King with this negotiation, he will experience on our part the most open and amicable dispositions. You will do me a great pleasure, Sir, when 
you shall be pleased to authorise me to write, that such a com mission has been given him. I have the honor to be, &c.
