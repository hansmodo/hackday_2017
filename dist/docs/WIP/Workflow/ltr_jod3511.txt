MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
MONSIEUR CHAUMONT has just informed me of a vessel bound to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, but I am reduced to such a moment of time, that I can only inform you that I am 
well, and enclose a few lines from Johnny to let you 
know that he is so. I have ordered the things you de 
sired to be sent you, but I will not yet say by what conveyance, for fear of accidents. 
</p><p>
If human nature could be made happy by anything 
that can please the eye, the ear, the taste, or any 
other sense, or passion, or fancy, this country would 
be the region for happiness. But if my country were 
at peace, I should be happier among the rocks and 
shades of Penn's hill ; and would cheerfully exchange 
all the elegance, magnificence, and sublimity of Eu 
rope, for the simplicity of <a href='/results.php?city=braintree' rel='city'>Braintree</a> and Weymouth. 
</p><p>
To tell you the truth, I admire the ladies here. 
Don t be jealous. They are handsome, and very 
well educated. Their accomplishments are exceedingly brilliant, and their knowledge of letters and arts 
exceeds that of the English ladies, I believe. 
</p><p>
Tell Mrs. Warren that I shall write her a letter, as 
she desired, and let her know some of my reflections 
in this country. My venerable colleague enjoys a 
privilege here, that is much to be envied. Being 
seventy years of age, the ladies not only allow him to 
embrace them as often as he pleases, but they are 
perpetually embracing him. I told him, yesterday, 
I would write this to America.
