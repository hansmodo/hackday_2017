Dear General, 
</p><p>
I am honored with your favor of the loth of October, and should have appointed the time and place 
for the immediate execution of Gamble, but both he 
and Davis had effected their escape, as I informed 
your Excellency in a former letter. The officers, who 
commanded the guards at the times they respectively 
escaped, were arrested, tried, and acquitted ; and, 
therefore, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you 
with the proceedings respecting them. 
</p><p>
I was applied to, to endeavour to intercede with 
your Excellency, to remit the sentence of Captain Beal ; but I thought it too just, to say any thing about it. The proceedings respecting Gosset were 
packed up, in a mistake. The Court-Martial sententenced him to be whipped; and, as your Excellency had authorized me to determine upon all proceedings which did not affect life, or the dismission 
of an officer, I did not intend to have troubled you 
with the proceedings respecting him. 
</p><p>
I have, for a long time past, had two parties in 
the country, commanded by Field-Officers, to impress cattle, and yet the troops are frequently without meat for several days together. Indeed, I am so 
well convinced that there is not half meat enough 
on this side the mountain for the supply of the 
troops, that I have thought it advisable to risk the 
sending a party of hunters to kill buffalo, at Little Kanhawa, and laying the meat, until we shall be able 
to send for it, which, I expect, will be in the spring. 
</p><p>
The Delaware Chiefs have declared war against the 
Senecas; and Captain John Montour was immediately 
sent, with two Delawares and one white man, to 
bring a prisoner from their towns. At French Creek 
(Venango) he fell in with a party of eight Senecas, 
who, a few days before, had taken a woman and two 
children from Westmoreland county. He shot one of 
the Indians upon a raft in the creek, and the rest 
ran away; but, after a few minutes, one of them returned, under cover of some timber, and asked Montour who he was. He told them that he and his men 
were Delawares ; that they were sent by their Chiefs ; 
and that they might thank God the water prevented 
getting at them ; when the Seneca expressed some 
mark of contempt, and followed his own party. This 
relation may be depended on. Captain Montour, with 
a party of Delawares, is now in pursuit of another 
party of Indians, supposed to be Delawares, or Muncies, who were discovered by a Delaware runner, on 
their way towards these settlements. 
</p><p>
I do all in my power to encourage partisan strokes. 
But, was I at liberty to give rewards, I have neither 
money nor goods to do it with. I can venture to 
say that I could, at any time, for a small quantity 
of goods, engage a very considerable number of Delaware Indians to go with me upon an expedition ; 
and I believe that a considerable quantity would 
enable me to set the Indians at war against one 
another, so as to divert them from our frontiers. 
</p><p>
Many of the inhabitants are uneasy to see any notice taken of the Delaware Indians, and once attempted to destroy a great number of them, who were 
under our protection, but were prevented by a guard 
of regular troops. I have hitherto made use of every 
address in my power to keep as many of them from 
joining the enemy as it was possible for me to do, 
in obedience to your Excellency's instructions ; and I 
shall be very thankful for your further commands 
respecting them. 
</p><p>
I am sensible that there are a great number of 
disaffected inhabitants on this side the mountain, that 
wish for nothing more than a fair opportunity to 
submit to the British Government, and, therefore, 
would be glad to have the regular troops withdrawn. 
</p><p>
I have received the General Orders respecting the new arrangement of the army, and shall remit the 
arrangement of my regiment to <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a> by 
this conveyance. I am a stranger to the intention of most of my brother officers; but, for my part, I am 
inclined to assist, to the end, in a work so nobly begun. I beg leave to return your Excellency my warmest thanks for your continual care of the troops which I have the honor to command. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

P. S. A half Indian, of the name of Bawhee, 
brought me a draft of the works at Detroit, which 
I take the liberty to inclose. He dropped some 
hints of his being in British pay, and I confined him 
in irons, but know not how to punish him without 
bringing more trouble upon the inhabitants.
