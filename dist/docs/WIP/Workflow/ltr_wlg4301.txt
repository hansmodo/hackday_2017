Dkvr Sir, 
</p><p>
The inclosed letters were handed to me the other 
day by young <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel='met'>Mr. Adams</a>, son of <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. John Adams</a>, 
who has arrived in the last packet ; and, no private 
opportunity offering, I do myself the honor of transmitting them by post. 
</p><p>
Congress are informed, by a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
that he has been introduced to the King of Great Britain in due form, and received as a public Minister from the United States of America. They have 
also received from the Commissioners for forming commercial treaties, projects of two treaties ; the one with 
the King of Prussia, the other with the Grand Duke 
of Tuscany. The former, it is expected, is signed 
before this by the American Ministers. Don Diego 
de Gardoqui, who has plenipotentiary powers, has 
been received; and Congress have passed a commission to INIr. Jay, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to negotiate with him. 
</p><p>
Congress have lately paid great attention to the 
proposed alteration of the ninth article of the Confederation, and it has been debated several times. I 
did myself the honor to inclose this paper some time 
ago. There seem to be three opinions. Some are 
for the alteration as reported, provided eleven, and 
not nine States, have the exercise of the powers. 
Others are for forming a act, and submitting 
</p><p>
the same to the States. A third opinion is against 
any change whatever. I expect, after the subject has 
been thoroughly investigated, it will, by consent, be 
put off till the members have had an opportunity of 
consulting the Legislatures. The requisition for the 
current year is nearly finished. By this the States 
are called upon to pay three millions of dollars, that 
is, one million in specie, and two millions in interest 
on liquidated certificates ; the whole containing a provision as well for the purposes of government as for 
the interest on the foreign and domestic debt. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to inclose propositions respecting the 
coinage of gold, silver, and copper, which are at present before Congress. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
