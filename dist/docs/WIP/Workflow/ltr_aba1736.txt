17 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1777">1777</a>. 
</p><p>
I HAVE to acknowledge a feast of letters from you since I wrote last ; their dates from August 19th 
to September 1st. It is a very great satisfaction to me to know from day to day the movement of Howe 
and his banditti. We live in hourly expectation of important intelligence . from both armies. Heaven 
grant us victory and peace ; two blessings, I fear, we are very undeserving of. 
</p><p>
Enclosed you will find a letter to <a href="/results.php?tla=jal" rel="acquaintance">Mr. Lovell</a>, who was so obliging as to send me a plan of that part of 
the country, which is like to be the present seat of war. He accompanied it with a very polite letter, 
and I esteem myself much obliged to him ; but there is no reward this side the grave that would be a 
temptation to me to undergo the agitation and distress I was thrown into by receiving a letter in his 
handwriting, franked by him. It seems almost impossible, that the human mind could take in, in so small a space of time, so many ideas as rushed upon 
mine in the space of a moment. I cannot describe to you what I felt. 
</p><p>
The sickness or death of the dearest of friends, with ten thousand horrors, seized my imagination. I 
took up the letter, then laid it down, then gave it out of my hand unable to open it, then collected resolution enough to unseal it, but dared not read it ; 
began at the bottom, read a line, then attempted to begin it, but could not. A paper was enclosed, 
I ventured upon that, and, finding it a plan, recovered enough to read the letter ; but I pray Heaven, I may never realize such another moment of distress, 
</p><p>
I designed to have written you a long letter, for really I owe you one, but have been prevented by 
our worthy Plymouth friends, who are here upon a visit, in their way home ; and it is now so late at 
night, just struck twelve, that I will defer any thing further till the next post. Good night, friend of my 
heart, companion of my youth, husband, and lover. Angels watch thy repose !
