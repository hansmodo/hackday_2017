SIR, 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the personal ill treatment I have received at 
your hands, notwithstanding the cruelty you have shown to the 
unhappy prisoners you have taken, the feelings of humanity induce me to have recourse to this expedient to save you from the 
destruction which hangs over your wretched garrison. Give me 
leave to inform you, that I am well acquainted with your situation ; 
a great extent of works, in their nature incapable of defence, 
manned with a motley crew of sailors, most of them our friends, 
and citizens who wish to see us within their walls, a few of the 
worst troops that call themselves soldiers, the impossibility of relief, and the certain prospect of wanting every necessary of life, 
should your opponents confine their operations to a single blockade, 
point out the absurdity of resistance. Such is your situation. 
</p><p>
I am at the head of troops accustomed to success, confident 
of the righteous cause they are engaged in, inured to danger and 
fatigue, and so highly incensed at your inhumanity, illiberal abuse, 
and the ungenerous means employed to prejudice them in the minds 
of the Canadians, that it is with difficulty I restrain them, till 
my batteries are ready, from insulting your works, which would 
afford them the fair opportunity of ample vengeance and just 
retaliation. 
</p><p>
Firing upon a flag of truce, hitherto unprecedented, even among 
savages, prevents my following the ordinary mode of conveying 
my sentiments. However, I will at any rate acquit my conscience. 
Should you persist in an unwarrantable defence, the consequence 
be upon your own head. Beware of destroying stores of any 
sort, public or private, as you did at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>, or in the river ; 
if you do, by heavens there will be no mercy shown. 
</p><p>
