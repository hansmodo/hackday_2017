Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 12th February, 
containing a copy of one of 16th October last, for which 
accept my cordial thanks. 
</p><p>
Your observations in France, respecting a certain event, 
coincide exactly with what I expected on that subject. Indeed, the many interesting remarks spread through your 
letter appear to me to have weight. 
</p><p>
Our last accounts give us reason to suppose there will 
be no war between the emperor and the Dutch, so that the 
continuance of a general peace begins again to appear 
probable. 
</p><p>
Our frontier posts still have British garrisons, and we are 
impatient to hear why they are not. evacuated. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>, 
I suppose, is by this time in London ; his letters will remove 
our suspense on that head. 
</p><p>
The African states have alarmed us, but we hope peace 
with them may be obtained. Your attention to that subject 
is commendable, and you may do good by communicating 
the result of your inquiries to <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met friend'>Mr. Adams</a>. 
</p><p>
Our affairs are settling by degrees into order. If power 
be given by Congress to regulate trade, and provide for the 
payment of their debts, all will be well. Difficulties on 
those points still exist, but federal ideas daily gain ground. 
The people of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> resent British restrictions ; and if 
the same spirit should become general, it will probably influence the States to enable Congress to retaliate, and extend their powers accordingly. 
</p><p>
The Empress of China has made a fortunate voyage ; 
and it is said many are preparing to embark in that commerce. The spirit of enterprise and adventure runs high 
in our young country, and if properly directed by a vigorous 
and wise federal government, would produce great effects. 
</p><p>
A rage for emigrating to the western country prevails, 
and thousands have already fixed their habitations in that 
wilderness. The Continental Land Office is opened, and the seeds of a great people are daily planting beyond the mountains. 
</p><p>
Make my best compliments to Mrs. Bingham ; and believe me to be, dear sir, with great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
