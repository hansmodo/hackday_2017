Your kind letter, my dear niece, was received 
with much pleasure. These tokens of love and regard which I know flow from the heart, always find 
their way to mine, and give me a satisfaction and 
pleasure beyond any thing which the ceremony and 
pomp of courts and kingdoms can afford. The social affections are and may be made the truest 
channels for our pleasures and comforts to flow 
throuo-h. Heaven formed us not for ourselves but 
others, 
</p><p>
" And bade self-love and social be the same." 
</p><p>
Perhaps there is no country where there is a 
fuller exercise of those virtues than ours at present 
exhibits, which is in a great measure owing to the 
equal distribution of property, the small number of 
inhabitants in proportion to its territory, the equal 
distribution of justice to the poor as well as the 
rich, to a government founded in justice and exercised with impartiality, and to a religion which 
teaches peace and good will to man ; to knowledge 
and learning being so easily acquired and so universally distributed ; and to that sense of moral obligation which generally inclines our countrymen to 
do to others as they would that others should do to 
them. Perhaps you will think that I allow to them 
</p><p>
more than they deserve, but you will consider that I 
am only speaking comparatively. Human nature is 
much the same in all countries, but it is the government, the laws, and religion, which form the character of a nation. Wherever luxury abounds, there 
you will find corruption and degeneracy of manners. 
Wretches that we are, thus to misuse the bounties of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to forget the hand that blesses us, and 
even deny the source from whence we derived our 
being. 
</p><p>
But I grow too serious. To amuse you, then, my 
dear niece, I will give you an account of the dress 
of the ladies at the ball of the Comte d'Adh'mar; 
as your cousin tells me that she some time ago gave 
you a history of the birth-day and ball at Court, this 
may serve as a counterpart. Though, should 1 attempt to compare the apartments, St. James's would 
fall as much short of the French Ambassador's, as 
the Court of his Britannic Majesty does of the splendor and magnificence of that of his Most Christian 
Majesty. I am sure I never saw an assembly room 
in America, which did not exceed that at St. 
James's in point of elegance and decoration ; and, 
as to its fair visiters, not all their blaze of diamonds 
set off with Parisian rouge, can match the blooming 
health, the sparkling eye, and modest deportment of 
the dear girls of my native land. As to the dancing, 
the space they had to move in gave them no opportunity to display the grace of a minuet, and the 
full dress of long court-trains and enormous hoops, 
you well know were not favorable for country 
dances, so that T saw them at every disadvantage ; not 
so the other evening. They were much more properly clad ; silk waists, gauze or white or painted 
tiffany coats decorated with ribbon, beads or flowers, 
as fancy directed, were chiefly worn by the young 
ladies. Hats turned up at the sides with diamond 
loops and buttons of steel, large bows of ribbons 
and wreaths of flowers, displayed themselves to 
much advantage upon the heads of some of the 
prettiest girls England can boast. The light from 
the lustres is more favorable to beauty than daylight, 
and the color acquired by dancing, more becoming 
than rouge, as fancy dresses are more favorable to 
youth than the formality of a uniform. There was 
as great a variety of pretty dresses, borrowed wholly 
from France, as I have ever seen ; and amongst the 
rest, some with sapphire-blue satin waists, spangled 
with silver, and laced down the back and seams with 
silver stripes ; white satin petticoats trimmed with 
black and blue velvet ribbon ; an odd kind of headdress, which thev term the " helmet of Minerva." I 
did not observe the bird of wisdom, however, nor do 
I know whether those who wore the dress had suitable pretensions to it. " And pray," say you, " how 
were my aunt and cousin dressed ? " If it will gratify 
you to know, you shall hear. Your aunt, then, wore 
a full-dress court cap without the lappets, in which 
was a wreath of white flowers, and blue sheafs, two 
black and blue flat feathers (which cost her half a 
guinea a-piece, but that you need not tell of), three 
pearl pins, bought for Court, and a pair of pearl earrings, the cost of them no matter what ; less than 
diamonds, however. A sapphire blue demi-saison 
with a satin stripe, sack and petticoat trimmed with 
a broad black lace ; crape flounce, &c. ; leaves 
made of blue ribbon, and trimmed with white floss ; 
wreaths of black velvet ribbon spotted with steel 
beads, which are much in fashion, and brought to 
such perfection as to resemble diamonds ; white 
ribbon also in the Vandyke style, made up of the 
trimming, which looked very elegant ; a full dress 
handkerchief, and a bouquet of roses. " Full gay, I 
think, for my aunty That is true, Lucy, but nobody 
is old in Europe. I was seated next the Duchess of 
Bedford, who had a scarlet satin sack and coat, with 
a cushion full of diamonds, for hair she has none, 
and is but seventy-six, neither. Well, now for your 
cousin ; a small, white Leghorn hat, bound with 
pink satin ribbon ; a steel buckle and band which 
turned up at the side, and confined a large pink bow ; 
large bow of the same kind of ribbon behind ; a 
wreath of full-blown roses round the crown, and 
another of buds and roses withinside the hat, which 
being placed at the back of the hair, brought the roses 
to the edge ; you see it clearly ; one red and black 
feather, with two white ones, completed the headdress. A gown and coat of Chamberi gauze, with 
a red satin stripe over a pink waist, and coat flounced 
with crape, trimmed with broad point and pink ribbon ; wreaths of roses across the coat ; gauze sleeves 
and ruffles. But the poor girl was so sick with a 
cold, that she could not enjoy herself, and we retired about one o'clock without waiting supper, by 
which you have lost half a sheet of paper, I dare 
say ; but I cannot close without describing to you 
</p><p>
Lady N and her daughter. She is as large as 
</p><p>
Captain C 's wife, and much such a made woman, with a much fuller face, of the color and complexion of Mrs. C , who formerly lived with your 
</p><p>
uncle Palmer, and looks as if porter and beef stood 
no chance before her ; add to this, that it is covered 
with large red pimples, over which, to help the natural redness, a coat of rouge is spread ; and, to 
assist her shape, she was dressed in white satin, 
</p><p>
trimmed with scarlet ribbon. Miss N is not so 
</p><p>
large, nor quite so red, but has a very small eye with 
the most impudent face you can possibly form an 
idea of, joined to manners so masculine, that I was 
obliged frequently to recollect that line of Dr. Young's, 
</p><p>
" Believe her dress ; she 's not a grenadier," 
</p><p>
to persuade myself that I was not mistaken. 
</p><p>
Thus, my dear girl, you have an account which 
perhaps may amuse you a little. You must excuse 
my not copying ; I fear, now, I shall not get nearly 
all my letters ready, my pen very bad, as you see ; 
and I am engaged three days this week, to a rout 
at the Baroness de Nolken's, the Swedish minister's, 
to a ball on Thursday evening, and to a dinner on 
Saturday. Do not fear that your aunt will become 
dissipated, or in love with European manners ; but, 
as opportunity offers, I wish to see this European 
world in all its forms that I can with decency. I 
still moralize with Yorick, or with one more experienced, and say " Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." 
</p><p>
Adieu, and believe me yours, 
</p><p>
A. Adams.
