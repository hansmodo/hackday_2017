Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since my last letter to you, I have received yours of the 
10th of last month. 
</p><p>
The information that you and your family were then in 
good health; gives us pleasure. I continue feeble, but do 
not suffer much pain, except now and then from rheumatism. The rest of us are as well as usual. 
</p><p>
The cold weather you mention has also prevailed here. 
I do not recollect so cool a summer. Our corn does not 
look well. The crops of rye were slender ; those of wheat 
were good. 
</p><p>
As to public affairs, I do not wonder that you look forward to the consequences of the war with anxiety. We 
are told that " wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also 
shall he be punished," and this doubtless is applicable to 
nations as well as to individuals. He who governs all 
nations, sometimes corrects national misrule by making it 
instrumental to national chastisement ; we have been ungrateful. 
</p><p>
You and I are far advanced in our journey through life. 
We have in the course of it sometimes found the weather, 
the roads, and the accommodations agreeable ; at other 
times we have found them unpleasant, and occasionally 
distressing ; and so, my good friend, it will be to the end. 
Let us comfort ourselves with the reflection, that although 
we must expect to meet with troubles of one kind or other 
on the way, yet that they cannot prevent our getting home. 
On the contrary, they tend to excite our diligence and to 
quicken our pace. That we may both be enabled to keep 
in the right road to our home, is the wish and prayer of, 
</p><p>
Dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your friend, 
</p><p>
