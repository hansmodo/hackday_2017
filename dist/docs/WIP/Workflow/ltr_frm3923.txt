SIR: 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a copy of a letter wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. If you wish to 
stop all intercourse with the enemy, and prevent any supplies being 
carried into them, the position hinted for the General's cavalry is the only means to effect it. The change of the ministry indicates a prolongation of the war. Our lenient countenance towards those people who 
have surrendered to us, and are carrying a continual trade of provisions to the enemy, has obliged me to warn the people that they will be 
taken into custody under the Sedition Act. So great a trade is carried 
on along Wambo and Goose Creek, to supply the enemy, that all my 
vigilance to stop it is fruitless; and I find, to stop the trade of feeding 
the enemy, it must be effected by taking every person adjacent to town 
and make them prisoners, or keep them a great distance from their 
plantations, and remove all their possessions. Without such a mode, it 
is impossible to prevent the infamous practice. I have already gone in 
some respects in this measure, which I hope will meet with your and 
the Council's approbation. What I have gone into in this respect, is 
only threats, but wish to carry them into execution. My opinion on this 
particular juncture is, that we should act with a determination against 
every man whatever, who may be found playing a false game, without 
which a small reinforcement will ruin everything in the former channel. 
This obliges me to be more particular in having the State legion completed by every means that can be thought of, as Continental cavalry 
cannot be commanded for that service, which I am certain you have 
found by experience. Believe me, good sir, I wish to be clear of every 
public employment; but, to retire when my country calls for my poor 
abilities, I should call cowardice, and am determined, notwithstanding 
my debilitated body, to do everything in my power to see this once 
happy country enjoy its former liberty. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect and esteem, your Excellency's obdt. servant,
