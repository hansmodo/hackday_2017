Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I shall send you in October clothing for 20,000 men, 30,000 fusils, 100 tons of powder, 200 brass cannon, 24 
brass mortars, with shells, shot, lead, he. in proportion. I am to advise you that if, in future, you will give commissions 
to seize Portuguese ships, you may depend on the friendship anti alliance of Spain. Let me urge this measure; much 
may be got, nothing can be lost by it. Increase at all events your navy. I will procure, if commissioned, any quantity 
of sailcloth and cordage. A general war is undoubtedly at hand in Europe, and consequently America will be safe, if 
you baffle the arts and arms of the two Howes through the summer. Every one here is in your favor. Adieu. I will write you again next week.
