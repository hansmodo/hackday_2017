Dear General, 
</p><p>
The approaching session of the Georgia Legislature, 
and the encouragement given me by Governor Howley, who has a decisive influence in the counsels of 
that country, induce me to remain in this quarter for 
the purpose of taking new measures on the subject 
of our black levies. The arrival of Colonel Baylor, 
whose seniority entitles him to the command of the 
light troops, affords me ample leisure for pursuing 
the business in person ; and I shall do it, with all 
the tenacity of a man making a last effort on so interesting an occasion. 
</p><p>
The sterility of the present campaign affords nothing worthy to be detailed to your Excellency. Our 
operations have been confined to inconsiderable skirmishes, and some little partisan strokes on our part, 
which were brilliant, and served to amuse us in default of better employment. 
</p><p>
My last letter was closed and despatched a moment 
before Mr. Leslie's letter arrived, to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>General Greene</a>, 
to feel his pulse on the subject of an armistice, and 
administer every political opiate that could be contrived. The General's answer was obvious. Since that, 
peace has been the prevailing topic in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> ; 
the terms of it founded in conjecture, and framed by 
the interests and passions of different individuals. The 
wisdom and virtue of Congress have no doubt given 
the proper repulse to the sounders, who have approached them. It is more and more to be lamented, 
that the French force, under <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='colleague'>Count Rochambeau</a>, has 
not been applied to assist in opening the trenches 
before <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and that the idea of an evacuation 
of that post has been so successfully propagated. 
The expulsion or capture of the British garrison 
there, would infinitely abridge negotiation. I renew 
my wishes for a continuance of your Excellency's 
happiness and prosperity; and am. ever, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your faithful aid, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jol" rel="me">John Laurens</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. My letter will be delivered to your Excellency by Mr. Lovell, of the partisan legion. He is 
an officer of merit, and as such I take the liberty 
of presenting him to your Excellency.
