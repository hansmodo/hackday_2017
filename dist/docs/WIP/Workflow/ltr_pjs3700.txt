Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I embrace the opportunity which is offered me by 
Colonel Hughes to acknowledge the receipt of your 
Excellency's favor of the 10th instant, and most sincerely sympathize with you on the embarrassments 
which the disagreeable event in Jersey will occasion you. It is an awful lesson to the States ; and if it 
would produce a serious attention to their situation; 
if it would induce to greater exertions, and hence relieve you from the variety of difficulties which their 
torpor has occasioned you if it would evince the necessity of parting with so much of their sovereignty, 
respectively, as would enable the governing power to 
draw forth the strength and resources of the country, â€” the event would be happy to America. But, if 
only alarmed for the moment, and no adequate means 
are pursued for the future subsistence and pay of 
the army, our cause is lost, unless another system of 
 government is adopted. 
</p><p>
Impressed with the necessity of lodging competent 
powers somewhere, to prosecute the war with vigor, 
and finding a disposition in the Legislature to second 
my views, I have moved, in Senate, to request of the 
Eastern States to join in a Convention, to be held at 
an early day, for the purpose of settling and adjusting every difference which may exist with respect to 
boundaries ; to form a perpetual league of incorporation, subservient, however, to the common interest of 
all the States ; to invite others to accede to it ; to 
create a new State in this quarter, on conditions to 
be stipulated in such Convention ; to appreciate the 
most effectual means for prosecuting the war with 
vigor; to devise a fund for the redemption of the 
common debts ; to form a permanent and uniform 
system for drawing out the resources of the country, 
that we may not be incessantly exposed to the many 
evils incident on temporary expedients ; and, lastly, 
to invest Congress with powers so extensive as to 
oblige each State to do its duty. 
</p><p>
This motion is not yet decided upon ; but I believe it will not meet with much, if any, opposition 
ill either House. Mrs. Schuyler joins me in best 
wishes to you, Mrs. Washington, and the family. I 
am, dear Sir, your 
</p><p>
Most obedient and affectionate humble servant, 
</p><p>
