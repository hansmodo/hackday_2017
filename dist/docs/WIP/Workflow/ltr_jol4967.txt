My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The <a href="/results.php?tla=laf" rel="co-worker friend met">M. de Lafayette</a> will not long have delayed 
after his arrival to open to you a plan for introducing 
French troops into Canada. From the manner in 
which he explained himself to the General, he seemed 
to intimate a desire that Congress w'd solicit him to 
bring about this business, as being sensible of its 
utility to the United States. He did not expect to 
succeed in any other way than by intrigues, petticoat 
interest, &ca. He lays down as self-evident that 
Canada cannot be conquered by American forces 
alone ; that a Frenchman of birth and distinction at 
the head of four thousand of his countrymen, and 
speaking in the name of the Grand Monarque is alone 
capable of producing a revolution in that country. 
When he asked my opinion privately on the subject, 
and asked me what I would say if I were a member 
of Congress to such a proposition, I replied that I did 
not think Congress could solicit, or even accept it, 
because there did not appear a sufficient reciprocity 
in the benefits to be derived from such an expedition. 
On the one side there would be an immense expense 
of transporting troops, loss of valuable officers and 
soldiers, &ca., in fine, all the disadvantages, and on 
the other, all the gain. That he did well to say the 
project could only take place by indirect means, for 
a minister would not in his cool moments deprive his 
country of so many troops, with no other view than 
that of killing so many Englishmen, and conquering 
an extensive province for us ; that he was to reflect 
that France, tho powerful in men, had an extensive 
frontier to guard, and in an European war w'd not have 
to do with England alone. This was my private 
opinion to the Marquis ; my still more private opinion is, that we sh'd not give France any new pretensions to Canada. It is a delicate subject to touch on, 
but I dare say that we agree in our sentiments, and 
that the Marquis will be thanked for his good intentions, and his offers waived.

Our last intelligence, from deserters belonging to 
different corps, and who came out at different times, 
confirms the intended embarkation of ten regiments 
for the W. Indies. The 10th 45th and 52 d they say, 
were drafted to complete these regiments, and the 
forage and live stock collected in Jersey are destined 
for their use.

Gen'l Scott writes that the enemy are very busy in 
embarking baggage, as may be discovered from an 
eminence to which his parties go.

You will see the last unavailing effort of the com 
missioners in their manifesto. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate
