My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
Colonel du PortaiPs visit to Congress gives me an 
opportunity of relating some little transactions which 
serve by way of interlude to the grand acts of the 
military drama. Capt. Craig of Moylan's Light Dragoons, with sixteen horsemen surprised one of the 
enemy's patrols this morning, consisting of seven 
horse and seven grenadiers and took the whole party 
prisoners without a stroke on either side. The same 
officer informs us this afternoon from authority which 
he thinks good, that fifteen of the enemy's provision 
boats have fall n into our hands. 
</p><p>
We have received accounts from different persons 
that one of their floating batteries was sunk in launching. 
</p><p>
From the preparations made and every account 
obtained from deserters, spies, &c., we have reason to 
expect every day a pow rful attack on Fort Minim. 
</p><p>
General Yarnum has reinforced the garrison from 
his brigade, and such a disposition is made of our 
naval and land force in that quarter as will make a 
greater sacrifice the price of success, than I think Mr 
Howe in his present circumstances can afford. This 
evening, Capt. ^Nichols of the Eagle packet with the 
Cap't of an armed sloop, were brought to Head Quarters they were made prisoners by a detachment 
from Cap't Lee's troop, and as Nichols mentioned his being acquainted with some gentlemen of Carolina, 
Cap't Lee gave him a recommendatory letter to me. 
The honest seaman, tho he says his vessel was order'd 
to be in readiness for sailing at a moment's warning, 
seems to be affected by his misfortune and expresses 
as hearty rejoicing at the welfare of President Laurens as if he were a loyal subject to his master. lie 
says that Pond w T as on shore with him and narrowly 
escaped accompanying him hither. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to deduct from your pleasure by striking 
out the story of the provision boats. Upon reading 
Gen'l Varnum's letter of yesterday, I find mention of 
a convoy being driven back by our gallics ; the delay 
of their arrival has probably given room to conjecture 
in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> that they had been taken. 
</p><p>
10th. I have just return'd from an early walk to an 
eminence in front of the camp, where I had been 
listening to the tremendous, tho distant roaring of 
cannon. It is probable that this infernal noise is only 
a prelude to the more dangerous closer fight which 
has been so long meditated by the British and which 
both parties are prepared for. 
</p><p>
Will you be so kind as to tell me the orthography 
of galley, whether it be as already written, or thus 
gaily. 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
