DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 29th ultimo, I received at ten o clock this 
morning, which gave me much pleasure. I heartily congratulate 
you on your success thus far. I think you have had great reason 
to be apprehensive for me, the time I mentioned to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a> being so long since elapsed. I was not then apprised, or 
indeed apprehensive, of one half the difficulties we had to encounter, of which I cannot at present give you a particular detail. I 
can only say we have hauled our bateaux up over falls, up rapid 
streams, over carrying-places, and marched through morasses, thick woods, and over mountains, about three hundred and twenty 
miles, many of which we had to pass several times to bring over 
our baggage. These difficulties the soldiers have, with the greatest fortitude, surmounted ; and about two thirds of the detachment 
are happily arrived here, and -within two days march, most of 
them in good health and high spirits. The other part, with Colonel Enos, returned from Dead River, contrary to my expectation, he having orders to send back only the sick, and those that could not be furnished with provisions. 
</p><p>
I wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='co-worker met'>General Schuyler</a> the 10th of October (by an Indian I thought trusty), inclosed to my friend in Quebec ; and, as 
I have had no answer from either, and he pretends to have been 
taken sick at <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, I make no doubt he has betrayed his trust ; 
which I am confirmed in, as I find they have been some time 
apprised of our coming in Quebec, and have destroyed all the 
canoes at <a href='/results.php?city=point levy' rel='city'>Point Levy</a>, to prevent our passing. This difficulty 
will be obviated by birch canoes, as we have about twenty of 
them, with forty savages, who have joined us, and profess great 
friendship, as well as the Canadians, by whom we have been 
very friendly received, and who will be able to furnish us with 
a number of canoes. 
</p><p>
I am informed, by the French, there are two frigates and several small armed vessels lying before <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, and a large ship or 
two, lately arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. However, I propose crossing 
the St. Lawrence as soon as possible, and, if any opportunity 
offers of attacking Quebec with success, I shall embrace it ; other 
wise, I shall endeavour to join your army at <a href='/results.php?city=montreal' rel='city'>Montreal</a>. I shall, 
as often as in my power, advise you of my proceedings, and beg 
the favor of hearing from you by every opportunity. 
</p><p>
The inclosed letter to his Excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='co-worker met'>General Washington</a>, I 
beg the favor of your forwarding by express. 
</p><p>
I am, very respectfully, dear Sir, your most obedient, humble 
servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="me">BENEDICT ARNOLD</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above, I have seen a friend from 
Quebec, who informs me a frigate of twenty-six guns, and two 
transports, with one hundred and fifty recruits, arrived from St. John's, Newfoundland, last Sunday, which, with the inhabitants 
who have been compelled to take up arms, amount to about three 
hundred men ; that the French and English inhabitants in General are on our side, and that the city is short of provisions. I 
shall endeavour to cut off their communication with the country, and make no doubt, if no more recruits arrive, to bring 
them to terms soon, or at least keep them in close quarters 
until your arrival here, which I await with impatience ; but, if 
St. John's should not have surrendered, and you can possibly 
spare a regiment this way, I think the city must of course fall into our hands.
