Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I refer you to Mr Wallace for the views entertained of the changes in the bill as stated in your letter of the 13th ins*. 
These are entirely unexpected and I consider them fatal 
to the whole plan. If the Congress of the U.S. passed the 
bill in <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> by large majorities in both houses without annexing such conditions, there is no reason why the legislature 
of Penns a . should propose them and still less reason for 
our submitting to them. As restrictions, they are unavailing 
as indications of opinion, they are offensive; and a single 
word on that subject causes the immediate rejection of the 
Act by the Stockholders. I have so written to Mr Reed. Un 
less therefore these ideas be totally abandoned, I wish the 
question of the Bank withdrawn, as it seems useless to pro 
long a negociation which must be abortive.
