DEAR WIFE : 
</p><p>
I wrote a letter last night to you, my love, that gave you the best intelligence that I have been able to get. I have every reason to believe 
that the matter is settled before this j and as you may in confidence depend that whenever I am able to get the truth of matters I will transmit it to you, by express. I beg that you may bear with fortitude 
my absence ; and let us with humble confidence rely on Him that is able to protect and defend us, in all danger, and through every difficulty ; but, my dear, let us, with one heart, call on God for his mercies, 
and that his goodness may be continued to us, that we, under his blessing, may have the happiness of enjoying each other's society once more. 
I mentioned in my last letter about the salt. I beg that you may have it well dried and ground in the mill and then you are to sell it for 
one hundred dollars per bushel. Let Sam have the wheat sown as soon as possible, and I beg that you may take a little time to see about the 
plantation, and make Samuel do what is best to be done. As to Lea, I hope you will let no one have her without an order from me in writing, 
and signed by me. My compliments to you, my dear, and my children and friends. 
</p><p>
I am, dear wife, with great respect, 
</p><p>
your ever loving husband, until death, 
</p><p>
