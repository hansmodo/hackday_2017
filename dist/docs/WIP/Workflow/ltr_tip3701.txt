Sir, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hek' rel='colleague met'>General Knox</a> informed me, to-day, that no artillery 
was to go from hence. I had previously ordered 
fifty draught-horses to be impressed for transporting 
the artillery, ammunition, and tents. I now propose 
to dispose of them as follows; â€” For the Marquis de la Fayette's wagon, four; a baggage tumbril for the 
artillery officers, three ; for three close wagons, in 
which are to be carried from hence eleven horsemen's 
and sixty common tents, twelve ; the Field-Ofificers 
and Captains of artillery, two or three ; total, twenty-two. These may proceed to-morrow for <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>. The 
residue of the horses and sleighs, impressed on this 
occasion, I have ordered to be employed in carrying 
It was at the same time resolved by Congress, " that he be continued 
as a member of the Board of War, but that the exercise of aU his 
powers at the said Board, and his pay as a member thereof, be suspended during such time as he shall continue Quartermaster-General." 
</p><p>
clothing and provisions to <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, while their forage and the sleighing lasts. 
</p><p>
I wrote yesterday morning to Colonel Hughes, desiring him to give the necessary orders to his assistants at the Village, and King's Ferry, to impress 
twenty-five riding horses, for the Field and Staff Officers of the detachment ; the whole, if he thought best, 
on the west side of the river, to save the trouble of 
crossing. I also desired him to impress ten two-horse 
wagons, and have them at King's Ferry on the 20th, 
to take up the baggage of the officers, and the kettles of the men, as soon as they crossed. That number I judged sufficient, supposing the officers would 
take with them only their blankets, portmanteaus, and 
cooking utensils. Colonel Hughes received these orders, and answered me last evening that they should 
be executed. I have wrote to him this afternoon, desiring him to send one hundred axes to Major Campbell, at the Village, to distribute to the detachment, 
when assembled, if they should need them. I have 
also requested him to examine into the condition of 
the boats at King's Ferry, and see that they are prepared to transport the troops. 
</p><p>
I have sent orders to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, to have one 
hundred and fifty common, and ten or twelve horsemen's tents put in order immediately. These, with 
those proposed to be sent from hence, will be sufficient for the detachment, allowing seven men one 
common tent, and four Captains and subalterns one 
horsemen's tent. If there be three officers to a company, six will have but one horsemen's tent. It is 
proposed to furnish the detachment with two hundred 
narrow axes, one hundred and thirty pickaxes, one 
hundred and fifty spades, and two hundred and fifty 
shovels. By a return, received in November, there 
appeared to be spades, shovels, and one hundred and 
six picks (enough) at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. At the same time, 
there were plenty of good axes at Lancaster, from 
whence the transportation is easy to the Head of Elk. 
There are also five hundred axes at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>. But 
if, on my arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, there should be 
found a deficiency of intrenching tools, it will be 
practicable to complete the requisite number in two 
or -three days. 
</p><p>
I have proposed that the horses going from hence 
and King's Ferry, should be relieved at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> ; 
that the teams requisite for the tents, at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, 
should be impressed in that neighbourhood, and go 
as far as <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> ; and that the horses and teams 
impressed at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> should be relieved about Somerset Court-House. But should there chance to be 
provision teams at ISIorristown, returning to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, 
they may be detained a day or two to take up the 
baggage of the detachment, and save an} farther impress, except for the close baggage-wagons. The 
same may take place from <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> to <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a>, 
should there be teams returninji; from Rino-wood. 
That from Bucks county, in Pennsylvania, teams 
and horses should be collected sufficient for the baggage of the whole detachment, and rendezvous at 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> Ferry, unless the river should admit of 
water transportation ; that, if the whole proceed by 
land, the Bucks county teams should be relieved at 
Chester ; that teams should be furnished at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> for the intrenching tools, and whatever may be 
taken up there ; and thus the whole proceed to the 
Head of Elk. I have sent Major Piatt to West 
Point to request of <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a>, an active officer 
to serve as Quarter-master to the detachment. 
</p><p>
I have provided two Forage-masters, that have appeared to me as clever as any in the service, to 
accompany, or rather precede the detachment, to impress teams and forage; and a Conductor to attend to 
the march of the baggage. The greatest difficulty, 
that I foresee, will he in impressing the teams and 
horses with proper despatch and punctuality, for want 
of dragoons. The time of every impress must be regulated by the orders of the Commanding Officer of 
the detachment. 
</p><p>
I request your Excellency's orders relative to any 
farther arrangement of this business, or alteration of 
the measures here proposed. I am, most respectfully. 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
