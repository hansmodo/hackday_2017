DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I am informed that a Capt. Howell, in a N. W. cutter, has taken 
the flag schooner which G-en. Greene ordered to load with rice. I hope 
you have prevented her being carried away. You will confine Captain 
Howell for infringing a flag contrary to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s passport ; his vessel 
and crew must also be secured and confined as plunderers until I have 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s and the Governor's orders and directions, and the schooner 
be permitted to sail without delay for Charlestown. I have heard from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> there has not been any action, as was reported; the firing 
heard was within the enemy's lines, and proved to be a field day with 
them. As it is possible the enemy may make another excursion in the 
country, you will send me every horse you have, that can be of the 
least service, as I am determined to oppose them at all events. There 
are only two officers, and twenty-eight non-commissioned and privates 
here the rest have been sent away by the officers on frivolous pretences. 
Mr. Lesesne is absent without leave, Mr. Wragg also ; if he is a volunteer he must be discharged, and not suffered in future to be on the 
Commissary Department. Mr. Guerry is absent without leave, and 
must be dismissed. I expect every officer and private will be sent me 
that is able to act. I have had no answer from the General respecting 
the reduction of the corps, and have again wrote him on that subject 
yesterday. You will go on in equipping and arming your men as usual; 
and as soon as I hear from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, will send you a power to impress horses to make up your losses. I wish you would procure the 
ruin, sugar and coffee, formerly mentioned to you. If a stop is put to 
the injurious proceedings of the N. W. privateers, I shall be able to 
procure clothing, &c., &c., for our army, and again complete your men 
with those articles. I shall remain here some time. 
I am, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
