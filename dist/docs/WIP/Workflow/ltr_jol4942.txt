My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
You will receive by this courier, L d North's recantation. It would make an admirable contrast with a 
vehement oration which I heard him pronounce in 
the confidence of success, while I was in England. 
The treachery which he renounces is too palpable in 
his conciliatory overtures, to deceive thinking men ; 
but they may prove a fatal poison if suffered to be 
disseminated through the continent, unattended by 
the strictures of an able pen, which may serve as an 
antidote. If France has not declared war, she does 
not merit our alliance; but I think it is more than 
probable that the sword has been drawn by this time 
in Europe. There is no doubt of Gen'l Howe's being recalled, and that Clinton is to succeed him. The present moment requires vigorous counsels and uncommon management. 
</p><p>
I have many fears relative to our prospects of the ensuing campaign ; they shall be expressed in a short letter. My dearest friend adieu. 
</p><p>
Virtue and vigorous counsels with policy, are more wanted than ever. 
</p><p>
Your affectionate 
</p><p>

I fear the effects of northern expeditions and projects. Our main army will be emacerated, and nothing decisive will be done. Let us be respectable 
in the field, and have a full representation of the wisest patriots.
