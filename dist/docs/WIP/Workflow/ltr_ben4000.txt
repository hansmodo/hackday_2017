Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Yesterday, and not before, is come to hand your favour of April 14th, with the packets and despatches from Congress, &c, which you sent me by a French gentleman to Nantes. 
</p><p>
Several of them appear to have been opened, the paper 
round the seals being smoked and burnt, as with the flame 
of a candle used to soften the wax, and the impression 
defaced. The curiosity of people in this time of war is 
unbounded. Some of them only want to see news, but 
others want to find (through interested views) what chance 
there is of a speedy peace. Mr. Ross has undertaken to 
forward the letters to England. I have not seen them ; but 
he tells me they have all been opened. I am glad, however, 
to receive the despatches from Congress, as they communicate to me <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague met'>Mr. Adams's</a> instructions, and other particulars 
of which I have been long ignorant. 
</p><p>
I am very sensible of the weight of your observation, 
" that a constant interchange of intelligence and attentions 
between the public servants at the different courts, are 
necessary to procure to their constituents all the advantages 
capable of being derived from their appointment." I shall 
endeavour to perform my part with you, as well to have 
the pleasure of your correspondence, as from a sense of 
duty. But my time is more taken up with matters extraneous to the functions of a minister, than you can possibly 
imagine. I have written often to the Congress to establish 
consuls in the ports, and ease me of what relates to maritime and mercantile affairs ; but no notice has yet been taken of my request. 
</p><p>
A number of bills of exchange, said to be drawn by 
order of Congress on Mr. Laurens, are arrived in Holland. 
A merchant there has desired to know of me, whether, if 
he accepts them, I will engage to reimburse him. I have 
no orders or advice about them from Congress ; do you 
know to what amount they have drawn ? I doubt I cannot 
safely meddle with them. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Jay does me much honour in desiring to have one 
of the prints that have been made here of her countryman. 
I send what is said to be the best of five or six engraved 
by different hands, from different paintings. The verses at 
the bottom are truly extravagant. But you must know 
that the desire of pleasing by a perpetual rise of compliments in this polite nation, has so used up all the common 
expressions of approbation, that they are become flat and 
insipid, and to use them almost implies censure. Hence 
music, that formerly might be sufficiently praised when it 
was called bonne, to go a little farther they called it excellente, then superbe, magnifique, ezquise, celeste, all which, 
being in their turns worn out, there only remains divine ; 
and when that is grown as insignificant as its predecessors, 
I think they must return to common speech and common 
sense ; as from vying with one another in fine and costly 
paintings on their coaches, since I first knew the country, 
not being able to go farther in that way, they have returned 
lately to plain carriages, painted without arms or figures, in 
one uniform colour. 
</p><p>
The league of neutral nations to protect their commerce 
is now established. Holland, offended by fresh insults from 
England, is arming vigorously. That nation has madly 
brought itself into the greatest distress, and has not a friend 
in the world. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere esteem, 
I am, dear sir. 
Your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
