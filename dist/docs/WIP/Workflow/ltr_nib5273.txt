Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival I began with a full and frank conversation with Mr. McLane on the subject of the Bank and at 
his suggestion saw Mr. Livingston after which they conferred and I saw Mr. Livingston. 
</p><p>
The general purport of my communication was this. The investigation has given a new aspect to our affairs it disarms, or ought to disarm some of the hostility hitherto entertained toward it, and furnishes a new motive for pressing a 
decision. Under these circumstances it would be very agreeable if the Executive would concur in promoting the object 
which we would gladly attain by accepting such modifications as would be agreeable to the administration. I stated 
moreover the extreme awkwardness of having such a measure before Congress while the Department to which it belonged 
had no cognizance of it and my anxiety to cooperate with the Executive in modifying and perfecting the measure. I need 
not detail peculiarity of their situation which makes them passive and all that I could learn from Mr. Livingston was 
that the awkwardness was irretrievable and that it only remained to make the bill as unexceptionable as possible. 
</p><p>
We have then parted good friends.
