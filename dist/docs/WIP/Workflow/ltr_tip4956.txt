DEAR MADAM, 
</p><p>
You as rightly as fully believe that we feel a sincere friendship for each other ; and let it be lasting as 
our lives. I regret the separation which probably must 
soon take place ; but God grant it may be a short one. 
</p><p>
. . . For many years I regarded you with heartfelt affection ; but I must confess (and you will not think my friend 
ship is now less warm and sincere because I confess the 
truth) , that our repeated bickerings (I am sorry to use the 
word, but everything must yield to truth,) had sensibly 
lessened that affection, though it returned with all its force 
when I found we must part; and tis now heightened by
your very obliging, affectionate letter, which I have just 
received and read. Indeed, I formed a wish that you might 
not go, and was casting about in my mind in what manner 
I could provide for your safety and support, when Mr. Robie came in, and interrupted my anxious, but pleasing 
thoughts. When I last carried you to Marblehead, I had 
it in my heart to propose a mutual, cordial forgiveness of 
every thought, word, or look, which had ever borne the 
aspect of severity and unkindness ; but I need not tell you, 
that I am less prone than many to make an ado about such 
matters. I felt all, and perhaps more than I could have 
expressed ; and I entirely believed your feelings were kind 
and friendly as my own. 
You do me justice in believing that I have an aversion 
to cruelty and rage against those called * friends to government, some of whom I esteem highly, because I think them 
possessed of great integrity and worth. 
I agree with you, that a private station is often the post 
of honor ; and I feel not the ambition for titles and high 
places, conspicuous in some men : at the same time, I think 
it my duty not to desert my country in that cause which I 
have hitherto espoused, a cause which I believe to be 
founded injustice, although, in conducting it, many irregularities may have been committed ; a cause which, if given 
up, or the supporters of it be overcome, Liberty itself, I 
fear, will expire ; and at present I do not feel an inclination to survive the liberties of my country. 
</p><p>
But whatever becomes of me, may kind Heaven be your guardian and the guardian of your lovely daughter, whom I pray you to embrace for me.
