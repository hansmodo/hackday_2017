Honorable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, 
</p><p>
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the General Assembly : 
</p><p>
I think it my duty to pay this tribute of applause to those brave 
troops who, in repelling the formidable British armament which at 
tacked them on Sullivan's Island, vainly flattering themselves with an 
assurance of easy conquest, displayed firmness and intrepidity that 
would have reflected honor on Roman veterans; and I must heartily 
congratulate you on their heroic behavior. It is an auspicious presage 
of what may be expected from the valor of our other troops, when theirs
shall be the post of danger, as it demonstrates that men, animated by 
an ardent zeal for the sacred liberties of their country, and trusting in 
the Divine support, are capable of the most glorious achievements. 
</p><p>
The Cherokee Indians having committed such barbarous acts of 
hostility as threatened desolation to the frontier settlements, at a time 
when the enemy lay in view of this town, and an attack on it was daily 
expected, a considerable force was immediately sent into that nation to 
obtain satisfaction for their cruel outrages, by acting with the greatest vigour. Our people have behaved with much spirit. It has pleased God to grant very signal success to their operations, and I hope, by His 
blessing on our arms, and those of North Carolina and Virginia, from 
whom I have promises of aid, an end may soon be put to the war. 
</p><p>
Since your last meeting, the Continental Congress have declared the 
united colonies free and independent States, absolved from allegiance to 
the British crown, and the political connection between them and 
Great Britain totally dissolved an event which necessity had rendered 
not only justifiable, but unavoidable. This declaration, and several 
resolves of that honorable body, received during your recess, shall be 
laid before you. I doubt not you will take such measures as may be 
requisite, in consequence of them. A well-regulated militia being 
essential to the preservation of our freedom, I am persuaded you will 
think, with me, that your time cannot be better employed than in framing a law for making such improvements in the militia as may produce 
the most beneficial consequences. 
</p><p>
It is not improbable that, at the season appointed for the meeting of 
the next Assembly, the business of legislation must yield to that of a 
different nature, and it behoves us to employ the time of the enemy's 
absence in making the best preparations for defence, and enacting such 
laws as the present exigencies demand. I have, therefore, thought it 
for the public service to call you together now, that you may deliberate 
on these matters, which tend to the interest and security of the State. 
</p><p>
I shall propose what, in the course of your session, appear to me, 
and be happy in receiving your advice on, and concurring with you, in 
any that may effect these important objects.
