SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now return'd again to London from a Journey of 
some Months in Ireland and Scotland. Tho' my Constitution, and too great Confinement to Business during the 
Winter, seem to require the Air and Exercise of a long Journey 
once a Year, which I have now practised for more than 20 
Years past, yet I should not have been out so long this Time, 
but that I was well assured the Parliament would not meet 
till towards the End of January, before which Meeting few 
of the principal People would be in Town, and no Business 
of importance likely to be agitated relating to America. 
</p><p>
I have now before me your esteemed Favours of June 24. 
July 9, Sept. 25 and Oct. 2. In the first you mention, that 
the General Assembly was still held out of its antient and only 
convenient Seat, the Townhouse in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and by the latest 
Papers from thence I see, that it was prorogued again to meet 
in <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, w c ' I a little wonder at, when I recollect a Question ask'd me by my Lord H. in Ireland, viz. Whether 
I had heard from New England lately, since the Gen. Court 
was return'd to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>? From this I concluded, Orders 
had been transmitted by his Lordship for that removal. 
Perhaps such may have been sent, to be used discretionally. 
I think I have before mentioned to you one of the Articles 
of Impeachment brought against a bad Minister of a former 
King; "That to work his Ends he had caused the Parliament to sit in Villibus et remotis partibus Regni, where few 
People, propter dejectum hospitii et victualium, could attend, 
thereby to force illos paucos, qui remanebunt de communitate regni, concedere regi quamvis pessima," Lord Clarendon, 
too, was impeach'd for endeavouring to introduce arbitrary 
Government into the Colonies. 
</p><p>
Lord H. seems, by the late Instructions, to have been 
treading in the Paths, that lead to the same unhappy Situation, if the Parliament here should ever again feel for the 
Colonies. Being in Dublin, at the same Time with his Lordship, I met with him accidentally at the Lord Lieutenant's, 
who had happened to invite us to dine with a large Company 
on the same Day. As there is something curious in our 
Interview in Ireland I must give you an Account of it. He 
was surprizingly civil, and urg'd my fellow Traveller and me 
to call at his House in our intended Journey Northwards 
where we might be sure of better Accommodations than the 
Inns would afford us. He pressed us so politely, that it was 
not easy to refuse, without apparent Rudeness, as we must 
pass through his town, Hillsborough, and by his Door ; and 
therefore, as it might afford an Opportunity of saying something on American Affairs, I concluded to comply with his Invitation. 
</p><p>
His Lord p went home some time before we left Dublin. 
We call'd upon him, and were detain'd at his House four 
Days, during which time he entertain'd us with great Civility, 
and a particular Attention to me that appear'd the more 
extraordinary, as I knew that just before I left London he had 
express'd himself concerning me in very angry Terms, calling 
me a Republican, a factious, mischievous Fellow, and the like. 
</p><p>
In our Conversations he first show'd himself a good Irishman, blaming England for its Narrowness towards that Country in restraining its Commerce, discouraging its Woollen 
Manufacture, etc. And when I apply 'd his Observations 
to America, he said he had always been of Opinion, that the 
Subjects in every Part of the King's Dominions had a natural 
Right to make the best Use they could of the Productions of 
their Country, and that America ought not to be restrain'd 
in manufacturing any thing she could manufacture to Advantage ; that he suppos'd, that, at present, she found generally 
more Profit in Agriculture ; but, whenever she found that less 
profitable, or a particular Manufacture more so, he had no 
Objection to her persuing it ; and he censur'd Lord Chatham 
for affecting in his Speech, that the Parliament had a Right 
or ought to restrain Manufactures in the Colonies; adding, 
that, as he knew the English were apt to be jealous on that 
head, he avoided every thing that might enflame that Jealousy ; 
and, therefore, tho' the Commons had requested the Crown 
to order the Governors to send over annually Accounts of such 
Manufactures, as were undertaken in the Colonies, yet, as 
they had not ordered such Accounts to be annually laid before them, he should never produce them till they were calPd 
for. 
</p><p>
Then he gave me to understand, that the Bounty on Silk 
raised in America was a Child of his, and he hoped would 
prove of great Advantage to that Country ; and that he wish'd 
to know in what manner a Bounty on raising Wine there 
might be contrived, so as to operate effectually for that Purpose, desiring me to turn it in my Thoughts, as he should be 
glad of my Opinion and Advice. Then he inform' d me, that 
Newfoundland was grown too populous to be left any longer 
without a regular Government, but there were great Difficulties in the forming such a kind of Government as would be 
suitable to the particular Circumstances of that Country, 
which he wish'd me likewise to consider, and that I would 
favour him with my Sentiments. 
</p><p>
He seem'd attentive to every thing, that might make my 
Stay in his House agreeable to me, and put his eldest Son 
Lord Kilwarling into his Phaeton with me, to drive me a 
Round of Forty Miles, that I might see the Country, the Seats, 
Manufactures, etc. covering me with his own GreatCoat, lest 
I should take Cold. And in short, seem'd in every-Thing 
extreamly solicitous to impress me, and the Colonies thro' 
me, with a good Opinion of him : All which I could not but 
wonder at, knowing that he likes neither them nor me ; and 
I thought it inexplicable but on the Supposition, that he apprehended an approaching Storm, and was desirous of lessening beforehand the Number of Enemies he had so imprudently created. But, if he takes no Step towards withdrawing 
the Troops, repealing the Duties, restoring the Castle, or 
recalling the offensive Instructions, I shall think all the 
plausible Behaviour I have describ'd is meant only, by patting 
and streaking the Horse, to make him more patient, while 
the Reins are drawn tighter, and the Spurs set deeper into his 
Sides. 
</p><p>
Before leaving Ireland I must mention, that, being desirous 
of seeing the principal Patriots there, I staid till the Opening 
of their Parliament. I found them dispos'd to be friends of 
America, in which I endeavoured to confirm them, with the 
Expectation that our growing Weight might in time be thrown 
into their Scale, and, by joining our Interest with theirs 
might be obtained for them as well as for us, a more equitable 
Treatment from this Nation. There are many brave Spirits 
among them. The Gentry are a very sensible, polite, 
friendly and handsome People. Their Parliament makes a 
most respectable Figure, with a number of very good Speakers 
in both Parties, and able Men of Business. And I must not 
omit acquainting you, that, it being a standing Rule to admit 
Members of the English Parliament to sit (tho' they do not 
vote) in the House among the Members, while others are 
only admitted into the Gallery, my Fellow Traveller, being 
an English Member, was accordingly admitted as such. But 
I supposed I must go to the Gallery, when the Speaker stood 
up, and acquainted the House, that he understood there was 
in Town an American Gentleman of (as he was pleas' d to say) 
distinguish'd Character and Merit, a Member or Delegate of 
some of the Parliaments of that Country, who was desirous 
of being present at the Debates of this House ; that there was 
a Rule of the House for admitting Members of English Parliaments, and that he did suppose the House would consider 
the American Assemblies as English Parliaments; but, as 
this was the first Instance, he had chosen not to give any 
Order in it without receiving their Directions. On the Question, the whole House gave a loud, unanimous Aye; when 
two Members came to me without the Bar where I was 
standing, led me in, and placed me very honourably. This 
I am the more particular in to you, as I esteemed it a mark 
of respect for our Country, and a piece of politeness in which 
I hope our Parliament will not fall behind theirs, whenever 
an occasion shall offer. Ireland is itself a poor Country, 
and Dublin a magnificent City ; but the appearances of general extreme poverty among the lower people are amazing. 
They live in wretched hovels of mud and straw, are clothed 
in rags, and subsist chiefly on potatoes. Our New England 
farmers, of the poorest sort, in regard to the Enjoyment of 
all the comforts of life, are princes when compared to them. 
Such is the effect of the discouragements of industry, the nonresidence not only of pensioners, but of many original landlords, who lease their lands in gross to undertakers that rack 
the tenants and fleece them skin and all to make estates to 
themselves, while the first rents, as well as most of the pensions, are spent out of the country. An English gentleman 
there said to me, that by what he had heard of the good 
grazing in North America, and by what he saw of the plenty 
of flaxseed imported in Ireland from thence, he could not 
understand why we did not rival Ireland in the beef and 
butter trade to the West Indies, and share with it in its linen 
trade. But he was satisfied when I told him that I supposed 
the reason might be, our people eat bee) and butter every day, 
and wear shirts themselves. 
</p><p>
In short, the chief exports of Ireland seem to be pinched 
off the backs and out of the bellies of the miserable inhabitants. But schemes are now under consideration among the 
humane gentry to provide some means of mending if possible 
their present wretched condition. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by the very particular account you have 
favoured me with of the general sentiments of people in our province on the present state of Affairs between the two countries. They are for the most part the same with my own. 
</p><p>
I think the Revenue Act should be repealed, as not constitutionally founded; that the commission of the customs 
should be dissolved; that the troops (foreigners to us as 
much as Hanoverians would be in England, since they are 
not introduced with the consent of our Legislature) ought to 
be withdrawn, and the Castle restored to its rightful owners, 
the government of the province that built it; and that the 
General Court should be returned to its ancient seat, and the 
Governor's salary put upon its ancient footing. But it is 
also my opinion that, while the present American Minister 
continues, there is very little likelihood that any change will 
be made in any of those particulars, that of returning the 
Court perhaps excepted. And yet I am also of opinion that 
no farther duties are intended, and that although the American Minister might wish to increase that fund for corruption, 
the other Ministers are not disposed to humour him in it, 
and would not consent to it. I may be deceived in this 
opinion, but I have grounds for it. However, I think we 
should be as much on our guard, and use the same defensive 
measures and endeavours as if we saw new duties intended 
in the ensuing session. And nothing can more effectually 
discourage new duties than the diminution of the revenue 
produced by duties; a resolute steady refusal to consume 
the dutiable commodities. 
</p><p>
In compliance with your respected recommendation I 
introduced Mr. Story to a Secretary of the Treasury, who 
forwarded his memorial ; and he tells me he has obtained his 
request relating to the affair of Mr. Wheelwright's debt. He now seems to wish for some appointment in consideration of 
his sufferings from the mob. But I doubt whether it may 
be worth his while to attend here the solicitation and expectation of such a reward, those attendances being often 
drawn out to an inconceivable length, and the expense, of 
course, enormous. 
</p><p>
With the greatest esteem, I have the honour to be, Sir, 
your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.
