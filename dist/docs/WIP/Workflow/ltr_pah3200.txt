DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My great anxiety for the success of the American 
arms under your command, indus me to trouble you 
with this. Accounts from the camp are so various 
and contradictory that I know not what to rely on. 
If the weight of public affairs, under which you have 
so long labored, will permit, a few lines will be most 
welcome to me. 
</p><p>
Although it seems impossible to enlist Continental 
recruits here, yet the zeal of our countrymen is great 
and general in the public cause. I wish some proper 
exertions of that spirit were wisely directed to the 
general good. A hint from you may lead to some 
thing important,, at a time like this, when most people seem at a loss to fix on the most effectual means 
of prosecuting the war vigorously. The Assembly is 
now sitting, and I shall take pleasure in communicating to them any matter you judge proper for 
their attention. 
</p><p>
I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that with 
the most unfeigned respect, and the highest regard, 
I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
