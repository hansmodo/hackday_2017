MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had wrote a letter to Congress, and expected to 
have the honor of writing one to you before the 
Commissioners departed ; but, as I found them going 
off before I could possibly finish one to you, I 
sealed that, and begged Mr. Chase to desire your 
Excellency to open and read it, which contained the 
purport of what I intended to write your Excellency. 
I have, since that, been to Montreal, and find almost 
every person agreed to depart, without even seeing 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
General Thompson writes, that about eight hundred 
of the enemy had arrived at Three Rivers, forty-five 
miles below <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, where he is. This he has by report only. I find that all the heavy baggage is sent away, with the intrenching tools, &c. On that account I have ordered them back, and am this moment embarking for <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, where I hope to arrive 
by daybreak, and meet them with all the force I 
can make. I am far from fearing eight hundred men 
against such a force as I can muster. I have desired all the general officers to be with me there, 
who seem well satisfied to go on. Want of time 
prevents my writing more fully on the state of 
affairs here at present, which I shall not forget to do 
as soon as possible. In the interim, I am, dear General, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
