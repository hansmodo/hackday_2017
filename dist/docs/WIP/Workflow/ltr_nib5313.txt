Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since writing to you this afternoon, I have heard some matters about the Bill which have changed my views of its 
actual position and produced a corresponding alteration in the intentions announced in my letter. The interests de 
pending on the event are too important to omit any proper opportunity of promoting it and I therefore strengthen 
your hands with the inclosed which you will use discreetly &amp; only in case it should be necessary.
</p>
