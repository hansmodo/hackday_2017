DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I wish you to take a position in the neighborhood of camp, that we 
may join our force on the shortest notice, should the enemy attempt 
anything against us. The North Carolina troops were discharged this 
day; and it is highly probable that if the enemy attempt anything at 
all, it will be to-morrow, and more especially if they get intelligence 
that our force is collecting to a point. Col. Hammond is coining to 
join us with a body of militia, and I wish you to take command of the 
whole, and form a camp near to ours. If you will give orders for your 
troops to march in the morning, and come forward, we will look out a 
camp together; bring a small party of horse with you. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
