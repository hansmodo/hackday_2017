My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to write to you on the tenth instant. The 
ministry is changed rather sooner than I expected, that is to 
say, as to the totality. Messieurs Servan, Roland, and Claviere were dismissed by M. Dumouriez. He filled the 
places of the two former with his particular friends, and as this 
step was decisive and would certainly bring on very serious 
quarrels, it was supposed that he had prepared himself before 
hand for all consequences. 
</p><p>
It would seem, however, that he was less firmly fixed than 
he had imagined, for as the reason for sending away the other 
ministers was, that they insisted on the royal sanction to the 
two obnoxious and unconstitutional decrees, it was in the 
natural order of things, that they should be immediately sent 
back to the Assembly. Instead of that it is said, that Monsieur Dumouriez insisted on passing both, and in case of refusal 
threatened resignation. To his surprise the King accepted 
the resignation, and in consequence, his friends newly appointed go out with him. As the present set have not all taken 
the oaths, I will defer giving you the list for the present, but 
put at the foot of my letter the names and places of such as 
may finally be fixed on. 
</p><p>
The Jacobins were busy all last night to excite a tumult in 
the city, but the precautions taken to prevent it have as yet 
proved successful. I am told that M. Lucloier and M. de 
Lafayette still persist in their determination not to risk an 
action. If so, the present state of uncertainty may continue 
some time. If they fight and gain a victory, it is not improbable that we may witness some outrages of the most flagitious 
kind. If on the contrary there is any capital defeat, the Jacobin faction will be a little moderated. On the whole, Sir, we 
stand on a vast volcano, we feel it tremble and we hear it 
roar, but how, and when, and where it will burst, and who may 
be destroyed by its eruption, are beyond the ken of mortal 
foresight to discover. 
</p><p>
While I am writing I learn the following to be the arrangement for the new ministry. Of the old set, two remain, M. 
Duranthon and M. Lacoste. The former is said to be a 
pretty honest man, but rather too much attached to the Faction Bordeloise. The latter is considered as an honest man, 
well acquainted with the business of his department, the 
Marine. M. Lajarre is appointed to the department of War. 
He is a creature of M. de Lafayette. His ability doubtful, 
but his principles sound. M. Chambonas is appointed to the 
office of Foreign Affairs. He is un homme tf esprit, but une mauvaise tete, un mauvais sujet, and ignorant of the business, 
at least so says my informant, and he is well informed. M. 
Mouciel, a very worthy man, is named to the department of 
the Interior, but his acceptance is very doubtful. The 
minister of Impositions is not yet fixed on. He will I believe 
be a cypher, for two or three such have been applied to. 
</p><p>
This new ministry will be purged, at any rate, of some of 
its members, but one great doubt exists whether it will not be 
driven off by the Jacobin faction. It is in contemplation to 
make a serious effort against that faction in favor of the constitution, and M. de Lafayette will begin the attack. I own 
to you that I am not sanguine as to the success. Very much 
is to be done, and there is very little time to do it in, for the 
foreign enemy will soon be greatly superior in number, and it 
seems now to be ascertained, that Alsace and Lorraine are 
disposed to- join the invaders. Thus, while a great part of 
the nation is desirous of overturning the present government, 
in order to restore the ancient form, and while another part, 
still more dangerous from position and numbers, are desirous 
of introducing the form of a federal republic, the moderate 
men, attacked on all sides, have to contend alone against an 
immense force. 
</p><p>
I cannot go on with the picture, for my heart bleeds when I 
reflect that the first opportunity, which ever presented itself for 
establishing the rights of mankind throughout the civilized 
world, is perhaps lost, and forever. I write on as events arise, 
and shall continue to do so until an opportunity to send my 
letters shall present itself. I am, &c.
