Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 12th did not arrive until this morning. It 
is perfectly natural that your opinions should differ from mine. There will ever be a difference of opinions on subjects, which 
do not admit of demonstration. It will be very long before po 
litical subjects will be reduced to geometric certitude. At pre 
sent the reasoning on them is a kind of arithmetic of infinities, 
where the best information, the wisest head, and clearest mind, 
can only approach the truth. A cautious man should, there 
fore, give only Sybilline predictions, if indeed he should haz 
ard any. But I am not a cautious man. I therefore give it 
as my opinion, that they will issue the paper currency, and sub 
stitute thereby depreciation in the place of bankruptcy, or rather suspension. 
</p><p>
Apropos of this currency, this papier-terre, I could tell them 
of a country where there is a papier- terre now mort et enterre. 
The Assembly havec ommitted many blunders, which is not to 
be wondered at. They have taken genius instead of reason 
for their guide, adopted experiment instead of experience, and 
wander in the dark because they prefer lightning to light. I 
think you are mistaken in supposing, that the emission of paper 
will destroy the proportion of prices. This proportion is in 
dependent of the medium of trade. The one results from a 
relation of things, the other is only an ideal standard by which 
to measure those things. Your height and mine would be the 
same, and consequently the proportion of one to the other the 
same, although a measure of six inches should be called a 
foot. 
</p><p>
You are very merry on the subject of personal liberty, but 
the District has more to say than many are aware of. Is it not 
written in the Droit tfHomme, that liberty is an inalienable property of man inseparable from the human character ? And if 
this be so, pray what better mode of securing personal liberty 
than to secure the person ? Your wits may sneer, but you 
must learn to respect the decrees of the municipalities, which 
like, those of Heaven are inscrutable, but not on that account 
the less entitled to obedience and respect. The lady, I am 
told, is so far from complaining of the restraint she was laid 
under, that although an aristocrat, she tells the Assembly with all becoming humility that she finds their yoke is easy and 
their burden light, while the young gentleman ordered on duty 
in her chamber acknowledges that service to be perfect free 
dom. Shortsighted man that you are ! Is it not a general com 
plaint, that France is torn by a division of political sentiment 
and opinion? And what mode so effectual to produce a union 
of both, as to give the women of one party in charge to men of 
the other ? By way of addition and amendment, I would 
humbly propose that the male aristocrats should be put into the 
custody of the female whigs, and I dare say they would come 
out much less fierce than they were. 
</p><p>
That the Assembly should continue its session too long is 
both natural and necessary. Mankind in general reason only 
from their feelings, and therefore to discern the wrong, which 
that body has committed, the people must first be heartily displeased with them. And then they will go too far the other 
way. It is a pendulum, and the farther you draw it on one side 
the farther will it go towards the other. 
</p><p>
I have very late news from America, viz. the 14th of August, 
but my correspondents do not give themselves the trouble to 
communicate any political intelligence. The funding bill is, I 
understand, in this city, but I have not yet seen it. They have 
not provided for the full interest of the public debt. As to 
the ability of the country, you need not entertain the slightest 
apprehension. The domestic debt is always a mere nominal 
thing. It neither adds to, nor takes away from the mass of national property, but furnishes a species of private property, 
which from its convertible nature, and by holding a kind of 
middle rank between real value and the mere sign of value, 
may be rendered of admirable use to increase commercial circulation, invigorate the manufactures, and consequently to benefit the agricultural interests, which receive thereby under the 
name of price more than they pay under the name of tax. 
</p><p>
The situation of France is by no means desperate. A torrent of depreciation may inundate the land, and storms and 
tempests arise, but the one you know fertilizes the soil, and the 
other purifies the atmosphere. Ultimately health and abundance succeed the wintry appearance, which seemed fatal to 
both. Adieu. I shall leave this in a day or two.
