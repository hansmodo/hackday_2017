My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The difficulty, under existing circumstances, of knowing 
what to write to you, had determined me to write nothing, but 
to let the matter rest altogether upon the public communications from the Secretary of State. 
</p><p>
Coming to this place, however, on a flying visit to Mount 
Vernon, and finding the vessel, of which <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='co-worker met'>Mr Monroe</a> is on 
board, had not left the river, I have so far departed from my 
determination, as to be seated in order to assure you that my 
confidence in, and friendship and regard for you, remain undiminished. 
</p><p>
To time, and your own observations, if you should return 
immediately to this country, I commit the rest ; and it will be 
nothing new to assure you, that I am always and very sincerely yours, affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="me">George Washington</a>.
</p>
