My dear General, 
</p><p>
Everywhere I have met with delays; but so agreeable were they in their nature, that I cannot complain of them. It is not quite the same with the 
Indian treaty, although the hope to he useful has 
kept me there longer than I had expected. My presence at the openmg of it had been desired. Many 
circumstances kept it off. At last it began, and my 
influence with the Indians was found greater than I 
myself could expect. I was, therefore, desired to 
speak, to hearken, to answer. I took the liberty to 
caution the Commissioners upon such points as you 
had mentioned to me, and did not leave the ground 
until they thought they had no farther occasion for 
me. But, as the business is just beginning, I cannot 
give you any further intelligence, but that a great 
deal of intrigue is carried on by some Tory Indians 
of Brant's party, and that the Whig and Tory distinctions are kept up among those tribes to an 
amazing degree of private animosities. 
</p><p>
This day, my dear General, I am going towards 
<a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and Newport, where the French 
ships now are; and as, if I went by land, I should 
be so much kept off by my friends as to be very 
late at our appointed meeting, I intend submitting to 
the little inconvenience of going by water from Rhode 
Island to <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, where I hope to be about 
the 26th, and where I shall be happy to receive the 
orders of my dear General. 
</p><p>
Waiting upon the Assembly at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, and 
visiting <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> in my way to <a href='/results.php?city=mount vernon' rel='city'>Mount Vernon</a>, 
would be my plan; but I expect your orders, to know 
where I am to meet you. It is possible you had 
rather not go to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. In a word, my dear 
General, as your paternal goodness to me cannot 
stand upon any kind of ceremony, give me your orders; tell me what I had best to do, and I shall be, 
as you well know, happy to obey them. 
</p><p>
One thing, my dear General, I very much wish you might grant me. As the time of my stay in 
Virginia will depend upon your advice respecting 
French letters which I am to receive there, as it will 
be there a last visit for this American trip of mine, 
I shall be happy if, without inconvenience to yourself, you may come with me so far at least as <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where your friends depend upon me to have 
an opportunity to see you. 
</p><p>
Could you pay the Virginia visits with me, could 
I meet you somewhere, at <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> I suppose 
(where in that case I would go before I visit <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>), it would be to me a most heartfelt happiness. 
I beg your pardon, my beloved General, but I want 
to see you, and no heart can better feel the pleasure 
to be with you, than the filial heart of 
Your respectful and affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
