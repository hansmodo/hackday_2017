Sir, 
</p><p>
The secrecy and expedition of your Excellency's 
movement from the North River, defeated my wish to 
have paid you my compliments in person upon your 
route, as I never knew of your being upon the 
march until you had passed <a href='/results.php?city=alexandria' rel='city'>Alexandria</a>. In this remote corner, I seldom see a newspaper; and though 
we ought to have a post once a fortnight, we are in 
that often disappointed. 
</p><p>
I hope your Excellency received my letter of the 
22d of May, from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. I should have been 
happy to know jour sentiments thereupon, but do 
most readily conceive the vast public business, with 
which you are constantly surrounded, has deprived 
me of that satisfaction. Ever willing to give my little aid to serve this, our much injured country, I 
should rejoice to be instrumental to your Excellency's 
success in any way you would please to command ; 
but I think you would not wish me to act under the 
stigma, that has been so ungenerously laid upon me. 
</p><p>
The bearer, Mr. Blue, a reputable farmer from the 
south branch of the Potomac, desires to contract for the delivery of three hundred beeves to your army. 
As I believe he is a person that will perform his 
promise, I recommend him to your Excellency. 
</p><p>
That the Supreme Disposer of events may crown 
your labors with a glorious and complete victory is 
the earnest request of, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
