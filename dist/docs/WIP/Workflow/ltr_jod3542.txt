MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE letters from Mr. Dana and his young attendant at St. Petersburg. Both well and in good spirits. 
Letters to Mrs. Dana and to you go by Captain Trowbridge and by Dr. Dexter. I have no certain news as 
yet of Charles's sailing from <a href='/results.php?city=bilboa' rel='city'>Bilboa</a>, but I presume 
he is sailed. You will have suffered great anxiety on 
his account, but I pray he may arrive safe. I acted 
for the best when I consented he should go with Gil- 
Ion, little expecting that he would be landed in Spain 
again. Keep him to his studies, and send him to 
college, where I wish his brother John was. 
</p><p>
My health is feeble, but better than it was. I am 
busy enough, yet not to much perceptible purpose as 
yet. There is no prospect at all of peace. Let our 
people take care of their trade and privateers next 
year. They have not much of a land war to fear. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> has struck the most sublime 
stroke of all in that article of the capitulation which 
reserves the tories for trial by their peers. This has 
struck toryism dumb and dead. I expect that all the 
rancor of the refugees will be poured out upon Corn- 
wallis for it. Our enemies now really stand in a ridiculous light. They feel it, but cannot take the 
resolution to be wise. The Romans never saw but 
one caudine forks in their whole history. Americans 
have shown the Britons two in one war. But they 
must do more. Remember, you never will have 
peace, while the Britons have a company of soldiers 
at liberty within the United States. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> must 
be taken, or you will never have peace. All in good time. 
</p><p>
The British army estimates are the same as last 
year. The navy less by several ships of the line. 
What can these people hope for ? I fancy the southern States will hold their heads very high. They 
have a right. They will scarcely be overrun again, I 
believe, even in the hasty manner of Cornwallis. 
Burgoyne don t seem to be affronted that his nose is 
out of joint. He is in good spirits. Experience has 
convinced him, so I hope it has Cornwallis, that the 
American war is impracticable. The flower, the 
choice of the British army was with him. The King 
of England consoles his people under all their dis 
graces, disasters and dismal prospects, by telling them 
that they are brave and free. It is a pity for him that 
he did not allow the Americans to be so seven years 
ago. But the great designs of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> must be 
accomplished. Great indeed ! The progress of so 
ciety will be accelerated by centuries by this revolu 
tion. The Emperor of Germany is adopting, as fast 
as he can, American ideas of toleration and religious 
liberty, and it will become the fashionable system of 
all Europe very soon. Light spreads from the day 
spring in the west, and may it shine more and more 
until the perfect day! Duty to parents. Love to 
brothers, sisters and children. It is not in the power 
of worlds to express the tenderness with which I bid 
you farewell.
