Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliging letter of the 5th instant was delivered to 
me last week. 
</p><p>
You know it is important that confidence and cordiality 
subsist between the heads of the departments, that they 
may, when necessary, unite their efforts to promote their 
respective operations for the public good. To this end 
much delicacy and candour should be observed towards 
each other, and all unnecessary interference avoided. It 
is likewise important that harmony and confidence subsist 
between the principal and other officers of each department, that no personal jealousies or discontents may embarrass the business of it. These and all other prudential 
considerations will doubtless have their due degree of 
weight with the president, in all his nominations ; and I 
mention them, merely because they lead me to think it 
would be improper for me to recommend to the president 
any person for a place in any other department than the 
one in which I may hold the first. All that I could do, 
therefore, in the present case was, to inform the president 
that it would give you pleasure to serve the public in the 
place you mention. This I have done, nor could details 
be necessary. You are far from being a stranger to the 
public ; you have enjoyed strong marks of their confidence, and have long been personally known to the 
president. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
