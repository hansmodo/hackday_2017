MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HOPE you will not communicate to any body the 
hints I give you about our prospects ; but they appear 
every day worse and worse. House rent at twenty- 
seven hundred dollars a year, fifteen hundred dollars 
for a carriage, one thousand for one pair of horses, 
all the glasses, ornaments, kitchen furniture, the best 
chairs, settees, plateaus, &c., all to purchase, all the 
china, delph or wedgewood, glass and crockery of 
every sort to purchase, and not a farthing probably 
will the House of Representatives allow, though the 
Senate have voted a small addition. All the linen 
besides. I shall not pretend to keep more than one 
pair of horses for a carriage, and one for a saddle. 
Secretaries, servants, wood, charities which are demanded as rights, and the million dittoes present such 
a prospect as is enough to disgust any one. Yet not 
one word must we say. 
</p><p>
We cannot go back. We must stand our ground 
as long as we can. Dispose of our places with the 
help of our friend Dr. Tufts, as well as you can. 
We are impatient for news, but that is always so at 
this season. 
</p><p>
I am tenderly your 
</p><p>
