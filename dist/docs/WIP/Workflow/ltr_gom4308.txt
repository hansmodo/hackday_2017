My DEAR Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received yours of the 25th of March. Not having had time to read the gazettes, which are 
but just (and hut in part) arrived, I cannot from them derive the information you allude to; but my 
first glance at them shows what I am sorry to see ; and from thence I am induced to quote a sound maxim from an excellent book; - "A house divided against itself cannot stand." 
</p><p>
As to your re-acceptance, Sir, you know my sentiments, which, on that, as on some other subjects, are, 
I think, unchangeable. It will be time enough for you to have a successor, when it shall please God to 
call you from this world's theatre. If such successor is then able to fill the President's chair, it will be 
matter of surprise to those who can form a competent idea of the office ; but, during your life, I consider the thing as utterly impossible. And do not 
imagine, my dear Sir, that you can retire, though you may resign. You will, in such case, become the 
man of the opposition. However your good sense may differ from their madness, and your virtue from their 
villany, depend on it, they will cite you as being of their sentiment. If you are silent, you assent ; and 
if you speak, you are committed. In the mean time, your poor successor is obliged to struggle under all 
the weight of your reputation, as well as that of the office. And he must be a strong man, who can carry 
either; of course, a very rash man, who would attempt to take up both.

I am very happy to find, that the determination 
to maintain a strict neutrality is so common in America. I shall not dwell on that topic, because my 
several letters to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a> contain enough of it 
to weary your patience. By the by, I am mortified 
more than I can tell you, at the delay my letters 
experience in their passage. I task my mind, to its 
utmost bent, to discover those events which are most 
likely to happen, in order that (so far at least as my 
judgment can be relied on) you may be duly prepared ; and, after all, you hear of the event before 
my almanac comes out. This is provoking, and would 
be much more so, did I not find, from experience, 
that the things I wish are done as well, and perhaps 
better, than if my conjectures had reached you. 
</p><p>
I trust that, long ere this, you will have received 
what I had the honor to write on the 28th of December, 5th and 10th of January, and 14th of February. 
You will have seen that, in the end of last month and 
beginning of this, the long-expected insurrection took 
place, by which a new set of men are brought into 
power. Should the present society be able to establish themselves, I think M. Genet will have a successor ; and if, the revolution completed, things return 
to the point from whence they started, I am sure M. 
Genet will have a successor. As to those who rule, or rather the few by whom they are directed, you may depend that they have just ideas of the value 
of popular opinion. They are not, however, in a condition to act according to knowledge; and, should 
they be able to reach a harbour, there will be quite 
as much of good luck as of good management in it. 
At any rate, a part of the crew will be thrown overboard. It is my opinion that the members of the 
Convention lately arrested will do nothing, for the 
greater part of them have only parole energy; and 
if I were called on by any cogent motive to act, it 
should be in conformity to that idea. In my letter 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='met colleague co-worker'>Mr. Jefferson</a>, of this day, I tell him that I shall implicitly obey his orders ; but this is in reply to the broad hint, that my embarrassments may have 
arisen from inattention to the principles of free government. You may rely, Sir, that I shall be cautious to commit the United States as little as possible to future contingencies. In my last letter I 
gave you my idea of pojoulariti/. 
</p><p>
I have never thought that three parties could conveniently exist in any one country; and therefore it 
seems to me that one of those, into which they who 
call themselves democrats are divided, must join the 
royalists. I do not inquire what negotiations are 
carried on to that effect ; for I have no desire to 
meddle with such affairs, directly or indirectly, and 
should be very sorry to have the appearance of siding with any one party or faction whatever, being 
convinced that I can best do the business of the 
United States by keeping aloof from them all.

Those who command the royal or Christian army, 
as they call themselves, on the Loire, are good officers. Their enemies have, in my mind, passed the 
highest eulogium on them, in saying that the soldiers 
are brought to such a pitch of folly and madness, as 
to rush on, armed only with clubs, and possess themselves of the artillery, to whose fire they were exposed. As far as I have been able to learn, they profess themselves the friends of order and justice, and 
act conformably to such professions, protecting both 
persons and property wherever they arrive, and paying for whatever they take. Hence it happens, that 
their dominion is constantly extending itself; and if 
they should get possession of Nantes, which seems to 
be their present object, they will be truly formidable, 
because then, by means of the Loire, a passage will 
be opened into the heart of the kingdom for as 
many troops as foreign powers may choose to send 
thither ; or, if they should prefer fighting the battle 
with Frenchmen, they need only furnish money and 
warlike stores, and they would have as many men 
as they please, and the most fertile part of France 
to subsist in. 
</p><p>
Farewell, my dear Sir. May God bless and keep 
you, not merely for your sake, and still less for that 
of your friends, but for the general good of our 
country !
