Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the honor to address you on the sixteenth of August, 
and stated as nearly as I could the situation of Russia and Sweden. This situation has produced a very natural effect. Sweden being unsupported by her allies, and Russia having nothing 
to gain by farther fighting, but a part of the Finland deserts, 
not worth fighting for, they have struck a bargain of peace 
immediately, without the interference of any one else. This 
leaves the Russian and Turk to pursue their game single hand 
ed. The ministers of Britain are by no means well pleased, 
that they were not consulted by the Swedes; and I think it 
probable, that if Russia makes peace with the Turks, it will be 
</p><p>
without the mediation of Prussia or England. For, as things 
are situated, it seems impossible for those powers to do the 
Empress any mischief before next spring. 
</p><p>
The National Assembly of France have also adopted, as a national compact, the old family compact with Spain, and they 
are arming as fast as their disjointed condition will admit. At 
the same time, the general opinion of this country seemed to be, 
that the ministry would obtain very honorable terms from Spain, 
whereas the ministers themselves were, asl believe, much embarrassed as to the line of conduct which they should pursue. 
To support the high tone in which they first opened, would 
probably bring on a bloody war for an empty sound. To re 
cede, would expose them to severe animadversion at home, 
and a loss of reputation abroad. These circumstances appearing to me favorable, I wrote the letter of the tenth instant, of 
which a copy is enclosed. It is calculated first, to operate up 
on an administration, which I believed to be divided in regard 
to America, and a sovereign who hates the very name, while 
he prides himself upon his piety and moral fame. Secondly, 
it was intended as a ground of future justification for any measures, which congress might think proper to adopt ; and thirdly, 
it had, I own, a special view to the nature of this government 
and people ; for if they do eventually get engaged in war, and 
feel a little from our coldness, and if, in addition thereto, the 
commercial men find any ground of complaint, it will make 
them so eager to rectify their mistake, as to give us considerable advantages. 
</p><p>
In answer to this letter I received his of the same date, a copy of which is likewise enclosed, This was written in his 
own hand writing, and as it is said therein to be not ministerial, but confidential, we must so consider it. Consequently it 
is not a public paper. The inference to be drawn from it is, that the council could not agree as yet upon the answer to be 
given. Hence I concluded, that those who, pursuing the interests of Great Britain, wish to be on the best terms with 
America, are outnumbered by those, whose sour prejudices and hot resentment render them averse to every intercourse, except 
that which may immediately subserve a selfish policy. These men do not yet know America. Perhaps America does not 
yet know herself. They believe that British credit is essential to our commerce. Useful, it certainly is, at present ; but let 
our public credit be well established and supported, and in a very few years our commercial resources will astonish the 
world. We are yet but in the seeding time of national prosperity, and it will be well not to mortgage the crop before it is 
gathered. Excuse, I pray Sir, this digression. The matter of it is not wholly inapplicable. 
</p><p>
I waited upon the Duke of Leeds by appointment on the 
fifteenth instant, and I saw at once by his countenance, that he 
felt obliged to act an awkward part. I waited, therefore, for 
him to begin the conversation, which he did by saying he understood I was going to America. I told him he had mistaken 
my letter, for that by the continent I meant the continent of 
Europe. After some pause he said, that he hoped soon to fix 
upon a minister to America. That they had a person in contemplation, who was not however absolutely agreed on. I did not 
ask who it was. After a farther pause he said, that in order to 
save time, and obviate difficulties, the intention was to send 
over a gentleman with a common letter of recommendation, but 
having letters of credence in his pocket. I expressed my perfect approbation of this expedient. He told me that he was 
earnestly desirous of a real bond fide connexion, not merely by 
the words of a treaty, but in reality. I met these by similar 
professions, but took care to confine them to a commercial intercourse for mutual benefit on liberal terms. 
</p><p>
He told me, that as to the two points of the treaty, there 
were still difficulties. He wished they could be got out of the 
way. He then hesitated a little, and dropped the conversation. 
Having waited sometime for him to resume it, and being convinced by his silence that it was intended to hold a conference 
and say nothing, I determined to try for information in a different way, I began, therefore, by expressing with an air of serious concern my conviction, that their detention of the western 
posts would form an insurmountable barrier against a treaty with 
us. Knowing so well as he did the nature of popular governments, he would not be surprised, that some in America should 
oppose a treaty with Britain from serious doubt as to the policy 
of the measure, and others from private reasons ; and he must 
see that holding those posts would form an argument for one, 
and a pretext for the other. Finding that he felt this, I added, 
that their conduct in this respect gave serious alarm to reasonable well meaning men. Some believed their design was to deprive us of our share in the fur trade, which they considered as 
a serious injury, but others were convinced that holding those 
posts was attended with great and useless expense to Britain, 
which the benefits of the fur trade by no means compensated, 
and even that she would derive those benefits whether that trade 
were carried on through the medium of Canada, or of the United States. Hence they inferred some other, and consequently some hostile views. So that every murder committed by the 
Indians was attributed to British intrigue ; and although some 
men of liberal minds might judge differently, their arguments would have little weight with the many, who felt them 
selves aggrieved. He owned that there was force in these reflections. I told him further, that I did not presume to judge of 
the great circle of European politics ; but according to my limited comprehension, I was led to suppose, that they could not 
act with the same decisive energy towards their neighbors, 
while they doubted of our conduct. 
</p><p>
He said I was perfectly right; and he said so in a manner 
which showed, that this had been urged and felt during the late 
negotiations. I proceeded, therefore, a little farther, premising 
that this conversation was merely from one gentleman to 
another, and prayed him to consider, that in a war between 
Britain and the House of Bourbon, (a thing that must happen 
at some time or other,) we can give the West India Islands to 
whom we please, without engaging in the war ourselves, and our 
conduct must be governed by our interest. He acknowledged that this was naturally to be expected, and it seemed from his 
manner, that the same thing had been represented before, but 
not in such strong colors. I observed, that those preferences 
which we had a right to impose would have a most extensive 
operation ; assured him of my sincere belief, that their exclusive system, as far as it related to the commerce of their islands, 
had a tendency to injure that navigation, which it was their object to increase, because if we met them on equal ground of 
restriction, they would lose more in one way than they gained 
in another ; that they had many large ships employed in carrying the single article of tobacco ; and if we should pass a navigation act to meet theirs, they could not bring us a yard of 
cloth which contained Spanish wool, and so of other things. I 
thought I could perceive, that considerations like these had al 
ready given them some alarm. I therefore said, that I supposed his people had transmitted information of the attempts 
made in congress to adopt such regulations. He said they had. 
I observed that not having yet received the laws passed by 
congress I should not say exactly what had been done. That 
I hoped things were yet open for treaty. That doubtless there 
were many persons in this country, who, to gratify the resentment occasioned by losses or disappointments in the American 
war, would be glad to urge on a state of commercial hostilities ; 
but this would prove, perhaps, a losing game to both. He 
really thought it would. 
</p><p>
Having gone as far in that line as was useful, I took a short 
turn in my subject, and said I had waited with great patience 
during the negotiations they were carrying on, because I sup 
posed they would naturally square their conduct towards us by 
their position in respect to other nations. I made this observation in a careless manner, as a thing of course ; but immediately fixing my eye upon him, he showed that it was exactly 
the circumstance they had wished to conceal. I added, that 
finding the northern courts were at peace, and supposing they 
had come to their final decisions with respect to the House of 
Bourbon, I thought it probable that they were prepared to 
speak definitely to us also. Here I waited for his answer, which, indeed, I did not expect to receive. He was sufficiently embarrassed, and from his look and manner I collected quite as much as he was willing to communicate. 
</p><p>
After some little sayings of no consequence, he asked me 
what the United States would think of the undefined claim of 
Spain to America. Having no objection to take that information from his questions, which could not be drawn forth in his 
answers, I told him that it would make no impression on our 
minds. That the Spaniards, being in fact apprehensive of danger from us, were disposed to make sacrifices for our friend 
ship. That the navigation of the Mississippi, hitherto the bone 
of contention, was, I believed, given up by them already, or 
soon would be so ; and as for their claims, they never could 
affect us, and therefore we did not care anything about them. 
That the reason for withholding that navigation, hitherto, was 
the fear of contraband trade, and for the same reason they 
must, in my opinion, sacrifice the last man, and last shilling, 
upon the question about Nootka Sound. He said he had al 
ways thought the danger of contraband ought to be considered 
in dealing on this subject, for that nations, like individuals, 
ought to treat with candor and honesty. We had a good deal 
of conversation on that, and other topics, in which America 
was not directly concerned ; and then I told him, that if they 
came to any determination in regard to us speedily, I should 
wish to be apprized of it. He assured me that I should, and 
offered to make his communications to you through me, and 
for that purpose to address his letters to me in Paris ; but for 
reasons communicated in a former letter, I thought it best to 
decline this offer, and therefore observed, that his own packets 
would give him a speedier and more certain means of conveyance. I then took my leave. 
</p><p>
I have troubled you, Sir, with the leading features of this 
conversation, that you might the better judge of the conclusions 
I draw from it. I think the cabinet is divided on the question 
of war or peace. If France appeared strong enough to excuse 
a retrograde manoeuvre, I believe they would discover all at 
once that Spain has better reasons to urge, than they had been 
before apprized of, and therefore, on principles of justice, and 
having received the strongest assurances of brotherly love from 
the Catholic King, the Defender of the Faith would disarm. 
His ministers will not treat with us at present, unless they can 
see their way to an offensive and defensive alliance, which we 
shall be in no hurry to contract. Should war break out, the 
anti- American party will, I believe, agree to any terms ; for 
it is more the taste of the medicine which they nauseate, than 
the quantity of the dose. Mr Pitt, T believe, wishes a continuance of peace. Observe that he is rather the Queen's 
man than the King s, and that since his Majesty's illness, she 
has been of great consequence. This depends in part on a 
medical reason. To prevent the relapse of persons who have 
been mad, they must be kept in constant awe of somebody ; 
and it is said that the physician of the king gave the matter in 
charge to his royal consort, who performs that, like every other part of her conjugal duty, with singular zeal and perseverance. He, and all those who are in possession of his entire 
confidence, wish, it is said, for war ; which gives, you know, 
great patronage, and, by the increase of taxes and offices, in 
creases the influence and power of the crown. The king, and 
his friends, are also violently indisposed to America. 
</p><p>
Things being so situated, and having business on the continent, I shall leave this city in a few days, and shall perhaps 
write a further letter of lamentations to the Duke of Leeds before I go. I intend to write such a letter to you on the whole 
business, as may, in case of need, be laid before the legislature, and consequently before the public. 
</p><p>
I long since expressed my opinion to you, Sir, that the appearances of prosperity here were fallacious. In nothing are 
they more so, than in the affairs of the India Company, which are deplorably bad ; and they are now engaged in a war with Tippoo Saib, which, terminate how it may, must make them worse. 
</p><p>
It is time to close this long epistle. Let me therefore entreat you to receive the assurances of that sincere respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, &c.
