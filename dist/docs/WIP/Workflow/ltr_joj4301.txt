Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Under the same cover with my letter to you of the 2d instant, I transmitted a pamphlet, in which I have since remarked the errors mentioned in the inclosed printed paper. 
</p><p>
Although you have wisely retired from public employments, and calmly view, from the temple of fame, 
the various exertions of that sovereignty and independence which <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> has enabled you to be so 
greatly and gloriously instrumental in securing to your country, yet I am persuaded you cannot view 
them with the eye of an unconcerned spectator. Experience has pointed out errors in our National Government, which call for correction, and which threaten to blast the fruit we expected from our "Tree 
of Liberty." The Convention, proposed by Virginia, may do some good, and would perhaps do more, if it comprehended more objects. An opinion begins to 
prevail, that a General Convention for revising the articles of Confederation would be expedient. Whether the people are yet ripe for such a measure, or 
whether the system proposed to be attained by it, is only to be expected from calamity and commotion, is difficult to ascertain. I think we are in a delicate 
situation, and a variety of considerations and circumstances give me uneasiness. It is in contemplation to take measures for forming a General Convention. 
The plan is not matured. If it should be well concerted, and take effect, I am fervent in my wishes that it may comport with the line of life you have marked out for yourself, to favor your country with 
your counsels on such an important and single occasion. I suggest this merely as a hint for consideration ; and am, with the highest respect and esteem, 
</p><p>
Yours, &c., 
</p><p>
John Jay.
