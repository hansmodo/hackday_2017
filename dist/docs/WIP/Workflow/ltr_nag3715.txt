Sir, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 15th instant, when I was endeavouring to 
collect a body of militia to reenforce this army. But 
the enemy; early on the 19th, filed off to Hillsborough, where Lord Cornwallis issued a proclamation 
(a copy of which is inclosed), and made use of every 
art to induce the people to join him. To prevent his 
success in the execution of this business, which we 
had every reason to believe he would accomplish, I 
was obliged to recross the Dan River before the 
militia could be assembled. This was effected on the 
23d, and with great difficulty we have reached this place. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of provision, which is rendered more 
distressing by the loose and irregular manner in 
which the militia of this country take the field, is 
not only embarrassing, but very alarming. The want 
of penal laws to oblige the inhabitants to supply 
themselves with arms and accoutrements, renders the 
aid of the militia precarious and almost useless. I 
am anxiously waiting the arrival of Colonel William Campbell, who is expected to join us with a respectable body of mounted riflemen, which will enable 
this army to approach the enemy with greater confidence and effectually to harass their way. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis evacuated Hillsborough on the 
26th, and moved on the road to Guilford Court-House, 
and crossed the Haw River, at Tralinger's Ford, twenty miles below this place, last night. His route and 
his object are uncertain; but circumstances lead to a 
belief that he will move towards Cross Creek, by 
which I fear he will collect a very large number of 
the disaffected inhabitants. I have received no accounts from General Sumpter; but wish he may be 
able, in conjunction with <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='colleague met'>General Marion</a>, to destroy 
some of the enemy's small posts in South Carolina, 
and prevent the accomplishment of their designs in that country. The enemy have ordered two regiments of negroes to be immediately embodied, and 
are drafting a great proportion of the young men of 
that State, to serve during the war. 
</p><p>
We have the most unequivocal and full evidence of 
the disaffection of a great part of this State. The 
enemy have raised seven independent companies in a 
single day; and we have the mortification to find, 
that most of the prisoners we take are inhabitants 
of America. The Legislature, I am informed, have 
passed a law for drafting twenty-seven hundred men 
for twelve months, but they cannot attempt to carry 
it into effect while the enemy continue in the State. 
</p><p>
Our detachments have been successful in several 
attempts upon the enemy's pickets, having killed and 
wounded about thirty, and made twenty prisoners, 
without any loss. <a href='/results.php?tla=anp' rel='colleague met'>General Pickens</a>, with a body of 
mounted riflemen, and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with 
the cavalry of his legion, were detached to endeavour 
to harass the enemy ; and being informed that Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton had passed the Haw River, 
near General Butler's plantation, they immediately 
went in pursuit of him, but, unfortunately, came up 
with a body of upwards of two hundred of Colonel 
Hambleton's corps, and the North Carolina Tories, 
three miles in his rear, who were to have joined him 
that evening. The General attempted to pass by 
them as a detachment of the British army, which the 
legion succeeded in; but when the militia came up, 
the enemy discovered their mistake, which obliged 
our troops to charge them, in doing which, some of 
the militia could not be prevented from firing, which 
alarmed Colonel Tarleton, and gave him an opportunity to escape. The whole of the enemy were routed 
in a few minutes, and the greater part of them left 
dead on the ground. Colonel Piles and several officers were among the number. 
</p><p>
The want of supplies in this country, the superiority of the enemy, and the mode in which the militia 
do duty, are alarming circumstances at this critical 
period; and, unless the most vigorous exertions are 
made in the Southern States, we cannot be relieved. 
Of the troops raised by the State of Virginia last 
summer, four hundred are now at Chesterfield CourtHouse, naked, and unable to march. But the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> has detained some clothing coming from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, which will enable him to send them forward 
immediately. They were raised for eighteen months, 
but the greater part of the time will expire before 
they join the army. I wish these States could have 
been convinced of the loss they sustain by short enlistments. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 2d instant, with 
the inclosed Act of Congress, was handed me on the 
20th. I am convinced that Colonel Armand's legion 
can render no service on its present footing. The 
officers refuse to go on duty with the men ; thirty-eight, out of a detachment of forty men, deserted 
to the enemy, and the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> was obliged 
to order a number of them to join their regiments, 
who are prisoners at <a href='/results.php?city=charlottesville' rel='city'>Charlottesville</a>. 
</p><p>
The militia of the back country have returned from 
their expedition, having destroyed most of the towns 
belonging to the Cherokee Indians. I have commissioned a number of the principal inhabitants to treat 
with the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations on terms 
of accommodation, subject to the determination of 
Congress. A copy of their instructions I shall inclose as early as possible. I have the honor to be, 
with esteem and respect, &c.,
