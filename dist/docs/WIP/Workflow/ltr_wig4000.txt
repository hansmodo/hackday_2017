My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I cannot resist the desire I feel of availing myself of the 
opportunity of the first packet since your departure, to 
express to you how happy you would make me by allowing me occasionally to recall to your recollection, in this 
manner, one who will always entertain for you the most 
sincere esteem and friendship. I am particularly anxious 
to hear of your safe arrival, and that you have found your 
family and friends well. These are points paramount to 
all other considerations ; but I know your return to your 
country will not be fully satisfactory to you, unless you 
have also found the state of public affairs such as to promise 
the continuance of good order and tranquillity. That it 
may be so no one more sincerely wishes than myself, and 
it would be a great satisfaction for me to hear it from you.

Since you left us, the news of the arrival of the treaty in America has reached us. We were singularly unfortunate 
in the loss of the Tankenville packet. By a strange negligence, the November and December mails from hence were 
both put on board that ship, without our having any notice 
of it from the post-office ; so that while I thought we were 
sending duplicates by two different conveyances, we were 
in fact sending them by the same vessel. My letters to 
Governor Simcoe, which I have frequently mentioned to 
you, and my despatches to Mr. Hammond on the subject 
of the treaty, were on board the same ship ; so that this 
accident has thrown us far back in the arrangement of many 
material points. I hope, however, that with attention, and 
a continuance on the part of the two governments of the 
same disposition which actuated all our communications 
and negotiations here, the great work which we have begun 
will be carried to its full extent. 
</p><p>
I have not been inattentive to the points which remain to 
be settled here. One of the most material is, I flatter myself, in a train of being well arranged. I mean that which 
relates to the admiralty courts in the West Indies, which it 
is in contemplation immediately to diminish in point of 
number, so as to have them only at Jamaica, Barbadoes, 
Grenada, Antigua, and Martinique. Knowing, as I do, how 
much evil has been produced by the multiplication of these 
courts, I look to this reduction with very sanguine hopes. 
But I hope the regulation will not stop here, but that the 
effect of it may lead to render the practice of those which 
will remain more correct and cautious than I fear it has 
hitherto been. 
</p><p>
The impossibility of our receiving the ratification of the 
treaty till quite the end of July, leaves us no chance of 
being able to propose to parliament, during the present 
session, those matters connected with the treaty in which 
the interference of the legislature is necessary. I know 
that this delay will be misconstrued on your side of the 
water ; but it is unavoidable. I requested <a href="/results.php?tla=top" rel="colleague met">Mr. Pinckney</a>, 
before he went to Spain, to write to America on this point, 
in order that the explanation of it might not rest merely on 
the communications of our minister there. You will be 
able to speak with still more knowledge and effect to the 
same point. Whatever does not depend on the repeal or 
alteration of existing laws, will be immediately executed on 
the receipt of the ratification. 
</p><p>
The public papers and other communications will inform 
you fully of the state of affairs in Europe. The dispositions 
of the people in France are evidently turning very fast to 
the establishment of some settled order, which may relieve 
them from the miseries of their present anarchy. In a 
similar situation in this country, we experienced the advantage of a known and moderate form of government under 
which the nation had before been happy, and to which, therefore, it returned with enthusiasm and almost with unanimity. 
The want of such a standard to resort to is now, as far as 
I can judge, the great obstacle to the restoration of order in 
France, and, consequently, of peace in Europe. Mild as 
their old government was in its practice, it was attended 
with many circumstances the renewal of which creates 
great apprehension and uneasiness ; and there is no authority 
of sufficient weight to prescribe the form and limits of any 
change. Some of the belligerent powers are, as you will 
have seen, too impatient to wait the result of this doubtful 
issue. To others, all idea of peace which shall not give 
better security than the signature of the committee of 
safety, or the ratification of the convention, seems delusive 
and dangerous ; and to this sentiment I profess myself 
strongly inclined. You are happy in America if you can 
avoid, as I trust you will, the dangers both of the war and 
of the peace. 
</p><p>
With the sincerest wishes for your prosperity, 
Believe me, sir, 
Your most attached and faithful humble servant,
