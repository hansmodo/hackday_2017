Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am to acknowledge your favors of the twenty-sixth of November, and seventeenth of December, which reached me two 
days ago. The system of finance did not indeed fully meet 
my opinions, but I know it is necessary to conform even to the 
prejudices of mankind. I fully believe with you, that any re 
sources dependent on consumption will greatly increase. I believe this increase will not be merely in proportion to that of 
population, but in the compound ratio of numbers and wealth. 
This last will be abundantly produced by an industrious people 
from a luxuriant soil. Taxation moreover excites industry and 
necessitates economy. It increases also the commercial medium, inasmuch as it creates a domestic object for the application of money, and forces an interior circulation. 
</p><p>
Pardon me while on this chapter, for expressing my apprehension that the sale of western lands will not produce the present relief expected, and it will consume a valuable future resource. 
America has not the needful money capital. I put aside taxation, and consider only the three great objects of agriculture, 
manufactures, and commerce. These in populous and polished 
societies present themselves in the order I have just placed 
them ; but this order is inverted with us. Commerce, by more 
potent means, commands a preference. To supply its wants 
a bank is useful, but its operations will not produce all that is 
expected. Among many other reasons, because we have not 
yet a great centre of commerce, finance, and money dealing. 
The payment of interest in the States has a tendency also to 
obviate and impede bank circulation. The channels of commerce are not yet duly filled. Those of manufactures are 
scarcely moistened ; those of agriculture are absolutely dry. 
Whenever therefore the government puts up lands for sale, it calls 
money from those objects to which I verily believe it might be 
more advantageously applied. The purchaser calculates, and 
will not part with his cash, till he sees greater benefit than in 
any other appropriation, Under present circumstances the 
hesitation will be whether to purchase stocks or lands. If by 
lowering the price of land you make that the greater temptation, stocks must fall, and then foreigners will buy them cheap. 
The land if sold cannot be cultivated, but if not sold it cannot 
run away as the stocks do. Besides, by throwing more land 
on the market you ruin those, who have no means to pay debts 
but by sale of real estate, &c. &ic. I quit the discussion and 
indeed beg your pardon for entering into it. 
</p><p>
My letters from London of the 24th and 28th of December 
will have communicated what passed with the British administration. I am sorry now that I spoke to them, because from 
yours of the 17th of that month I find it was the President's 
pleasure, that no other application should be made, but I flatter 
myself that the manner was such, as by no means to compromise the dignity of our country.
</p><p>
You very kindly, my dear Sir, in that letter communicate the 
President's approbation of my conduct. I cannot tell you the 
pleasure which this occasions, but you will estimate it by your 
own feelings under similar circumstances. Pardon me for 
adding that I feel highly gratified in receiving the communication from you. 
</p><p>
In this letter you enclose an order for <a href='/results.php?year=2475'>2475</a> florins, on the 
bankers in Holland. Make for me I pray you the proper acknowledgements. Pecuniary considerations never yet weighed with me, where the public service was in question ; and 
therefore immediately on receipt of the President's orders, I 
proceeded, without regarding other objects, as speedily as I 
could to London. Previous engagements had indeed rendered it my duty to go to Amsterdam, and on that route I made 
those inquiries which you once desired I would. The result 
has since been occasionally communicated to Mr Short. I 
embarked at Helvoetsluys the twenty-fourth of March, and 
continued in London til) the twenty-fourth of September, al 
though I had no business of my own there, but such as I could 
have transacted by letters. I would have staid still longer had 
I imagined it could have been of any use. My expenses dur- 
</p><p>
the 16th, and September the 18th, have come to hand. They suffice 
to remove all doubts, which might have been entertained as to the real 
intentions of the British cabinet, on the several matters confided to you. 
The view of government in troubling you with this business was, either to remove from between the two nations all causes of difference, 
by a fair and friendly adjustment, if such was the intention of the other 
party, or to place it beyond a doubt that such was not their intention. In 
result it is clear enough, that further applications would tend to delay 
rather than advance our object. It is therefore the pleasure of the 
President, that no others be made ; and that in whatever state this letter 
may find the business, in that state it be left. I have it in charge at 
the same time to assure you, that your conduct in these communications 
with the British Ministers has met the President's entire approbation, 
and to convey to you his acknowledgements for your services. 
</p><p>
As an attendance on this business must, at times, have interfered with 
your private pursuits, and subjected you also to additional expenses, 
I have the honor to enclose you a draft on our bankers in Holland for 
a thousand dollars, as an indemnification for those sacrifices,ing that period were 489 : 6 : 6 ; but I did not intend to 
ask compensation, nor do I mention them now in that view. 
</p><p>
Since I have been in this city a matter has turned up, which 
is very interesting to America, and the result of which is by no 
means pleasing. I mean the decrees respecting tobacco. 
The second day of this month I was requested to go to <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>, and thence with him to speak on that subject to the Committee of Commerce. I went to his house, but 
declined waiting on the Committee, unless they should previously desire it. This was fortunate, for the arrangements had 
been so illy made that the Committee did not meet, and for 
little reasons not worth mentioning, some of the members were 
predisposed not to receive information. On the 9th I dined 
with him, in consequence of a note desiring me to confer on 
American business. After dinner Mr Swan, Colonel Walker, 
and I were introduced into his closet with a M. Raymond, and 
another man whose name I forget ; but he was I believe some 
thing in the consulate at New York. <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> 
asked our opinion on the question then agitated, respecting a 
free culture of tobacco in France. Mirabeau had moved to 
prohibit it, after a certain time, even in the privileged provinces, 
but <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a> considered it as standing closely 
connected with the disaffection then prevalent in Alsace. Mr Swan gave it as his opinion, that if the free culture was allowed, the introduction of that article from America must speedily cease. M. Raymond insisted that the culture, if permitted, 
would not be pursued ; but it seemed to me that he did not, 
and indeed could not, think so. The other gentleman was silent. Colonel Walker observed, that he supposed France would 
consult her own interest, and therefore it was not worth while 
to inquire what was the interest of America ; and in this I think 
he judged perfectly well. I refused to give an opinion, but 
stated facts to show that Mr Swan was right in his judgment, 
and then observed that the question seemed to turn on the sin 
gle point, whether they could dispense with the revenue ; for 
if they could not, they must consider the means of obtaining it, 
which were either Duty, Excise, Farm, or Regie. That the 
first would, if great, be eluded. The second was not now 
practicable ; the third was unfashionable ; and by the last they 
would be cheated. If, however, they would dispense with the 
revenue, then not only they might allow the free culture, but 
they ought to allow the free commerce. I stated the advantages which would result from the latter. He seemed surprised 
at some things as not having presented themselves, and pressed for an opinion, to which I replied, that I would not advise, 
but predict. That they would begin by allowing the free culture, which would annihilate the revenue ; and in less than two 
years they would prohibit the culture to recover the revenue. 
The thing has turned out as I expected as far as it went. 
Colonel Ternant has endeavored to prevent the culture, and to 
render the commerce as free as possible, but in vain. We 
have held sundry conferences on the subject together. He 
communicated to me what was doing, and I gave him all the 
information I could. The Assembly have allowed the culture, 
and laid a duty of twenty-five livres per quintal upon the import, one fourth of which is taken off from such as may be 
brought from America in French bottoms. This, in addition 
to the heavy duty on our oil, bears hard. To the arguments 
of such as blame these decrees it is answered, that it will be 
necessary to form a commercial treaty with America, and then 
everything can be regulated. 
</p><p>
I had hitherto, you will observe, kept as clear as I could from 
interfering ; but the matter had now put on an appearance, 
which demanded the exertions of every American citizen. On 
the seventeenth, therefore, I called on <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague met'>Monsieur De Lafayette</a>. 
He desired me to give him a note on the subject, siid that 
Mirabeau had promised to speak about it ; and that he expected the Diplomatic Committee would take the matter up. I had 
been told long before what part Mirabeau would take, and how 
much he would receive for his agency. I asked, therefore, 
whether it would not answer for the king to object, because the 
Assembly being much divided, a trifle would turn the balance, 
and it had been said, that if he would himself have taken a part in the debate the question would have been otherwise decided, 
He told me he would rather the United States should be indebted to the nation than to the king. But if things go on at 
the present rate we shall be indebted to neither. 
</p><p>
The next day I called on the Count de Montmorin, who as 
sured me he would do all in his power. By way of a spur I 
told him, that it was currently reported in London, that the 
British were going to send out a Minister to America, that I 
had good reason to believe it was their wish to form an offensive 
and defensive alliance with us, and presumed that he was acquainted with their intentions. He replied, as I supposed he 
would, in the affirmative. Upon this I asked him whether it 
would answer any good purpose for me to write him a letter on 
the subject. He pressed me earnestly to do so the next day, 
as he was in the evening of it to meet the Diplomatic Committee. 
In consequence I wrote on the nineteenth that of which a 
copy is enclosed. 
</p><p>
You will observe that I hint at the views of Great Britain in 
such manner, that he must take on himself any communication 
of that sort to the Committee. As to the observations, I stated 
them as being made by American citzens in order to supply the 
defect of ministerial character, and also to keep myself out of 
sight, not choosing to be quoted in any of their deliberations. 
I have communicated these steps to Mr Short, and am now endeavoring to obtain, if possible, a duty per arpent on the culture 
equivalent to the import duty, supposing each arpent to produce 
eight quintals. This, which would, I sincerely believe, be use 
less to France, would also prevent the sudden decrease in the 
consumption of our tobacco. And although I am convinced 
that planting it is bad husbandry, yet I wish my countrymen 
rather to correct themselves by their own experience, than receive such a shock from abroad. 
</p><p>
As yet there is little hope of success to any proposition for alleviating, much less removing, the burthens they have laid 
upon us. The greater part have adopted systematic reasonings in matters of commerce as in those of government, so 
that, disdaining attention to facts and deaf to the voice of 
experience, while others deliberate they decide, and are the 
more constant in their opinions in proportion as they are less 
acquainted with the subject, which is natural enough. Stat pro 
rations voluntas has, you know, been the adage with those, who 
have much of one and little of the other, from time immemorial, and the Assembly will not, I think, lose by non-user that 
valuable franchise. 
</p><p>
I will do myself the honor to communicate such farther 
matter as may occur in this regard, and beg leave in the mean 
time to assure you of the sincerity with which I am, &c.
