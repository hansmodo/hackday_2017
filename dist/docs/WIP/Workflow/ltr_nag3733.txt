Sir, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place on the 2d of this instant ; 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> having marched from this some days 
before me, with a part of the troops under his command, the rest being on their march to Hillsborough. 
General Smallwood was below this, about fifteen miles, 
towards the Waxhaws, where he had been for a considerable time, before <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> marched from 
Hillsborough. On my arrival, I sent for him, but he 
was gone towards Camden, in pursuit of a party of 
Tories, and did not arrive in camp till the night before last. Immediately I called a Council, respecting 
the practicability of holding a Council of Inquiry 
upon <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a>'s conduct, during his command 
in this department. The questions stated to the 
Council, and the answers of the members, are inclosed 
in the papers from number One to Five. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Excellency, at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, that I should 
leave the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron De Steuben</a> to take command in 
Virginia, which I accordingly did, and to endeavour, 
if possible, to make an arrangement of that line. 
Since which I have not heard from him, nor whether 
the enemy have left Chesapeake Ba}'-, or not. As I 
passed through Petersburg, an express arrived from 
below, with intelligence that the enemy had returned; 
but, having heard nothing further of the matter, conclude the report must have been premature. 
</p><p>
To give your Excellency an idea of the state and 
condition of this army, if it deserves the name of 
one, I inclose you an extract of a letter, wrote by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> to the Board of War, number Six. 
Nothing can be more wretched and distressing than 
the condition of the troops, starving with cold and 
hunger, without tents and camp equipage. Those of 
the Virginia line are, literally, naked; and a great 
part totally unfit for any kind of duty, and must remain so until clothing can be had from the northward. I have written to <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel=''>Governor Jefferson</a> not to 
send forward any more until they are well clothed, 
and properly equipped. 
</p><p>
As I expected, so I find, the great bodies of militia that have been in the field, and the manner in 
which they came out, being all on horseback, have 
laid waste all the country, in such a manner that I 
am really afraid it will be impossible to subsist the 
few troops we have ; and, if we can be subsisted at 
all, it must be by moving to the provisions, for they 
have no way of bringing it to the army. I have desired the Board of War of this State not to call out 
any more militia, until we can be better satisfied 
about the means of subsistence for the regular troops 
and the militia from Virginia. 
</p><p>
Lord Cornwallis lies, with his principal force, at a place called Weymsborough, about half way between Camden and Ninety Six ; at both of which places the 
enemy have a post, and are strongly fortified. At Camden, they have seven redoubts ; at Ninety Six, 
not more than three, but they are very strong. Part, 
if not the whole, of the embarkation mentioned in 
your Excellency's letter of the 8th ultimo, as taking 
place at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and, 
it is said, Lord Cornwallis is preparing for some movement. 
</p><p>
I have parties exploring the Dan, Yadkin, and Catawba Rivers, and am not without hopes we shall be 
able to assist the army by water transportation. It 
is next to impossible to get a sufficiency of wagons 
to draw provisions and forage the very great distance we are obliged to fetch it to feed the army. 
The inhabitants of this country live too remote from 
one another to be animated into great exertions ; and 
the people appear, notwithstanding their danger, very 
intent upon their own private affairs. 
</p><p>
Inclosed, numbers Seven and Eight, are the reports 
of General Sumpter's last' action, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's stratagem, by which he took Colonel Rugley and his party. 
</p><p>
I find, when the <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague'>Baron Steuben</a> comes forward, 
there will be a difficulty between him and General Smallwood. The latter declares he never will submit 
to the commands of the former, and insists upon 
having his commission dated back to as early a period as he had a right to promotion. When that was, 
I know not, as I know of no principles of promotion, 
from Brigadier to Major-General, except their seniority or special merit. What is best to be done in the 
affair? Before I order the Baron to come forward, I 
wish your Excellency's advice in the matter. I fear 
our army is always to be convulsed by extraordinary 
claims, and special appointments. They are exceeding good men. It is a pity a dispute should arise 
between them, so injurious to the service as it must 
be. 
</p><p>
My ideas respecting the power given by Congress, 
for exchanging prisoners of war in this department, 
perfectly correspond with your Excellency's. I had 
no idea that it extended to the Convention troops, 
and, by my inquiry, only meant to learn your ad\iee, so that my conduct might correspond with your 
views. 
</p><p>
All the prisoners, taken by Colonel Campbell and 
others, have been dismissed, paroled, and enlisted in 
the militia service for three months, except about one 
hundred and thirty. Thus we have lost, by the folly, 
not to say any thing worse, of those who had them 
in charge, upwards of six hundred men. I am told 
Lord Cornwallis has lately made a proposition to 
General Smallwood for exchanging all the prisoners 
in North and South Carolina. If it is upon terms 
that are just and equal, I shall avail myself of it. 
For a great number of prisoners is a heavy weight 
upon our hands. I am too little informed of the resources still left in this country, and of the enemy's 
designs, to tell what disposition to make, or how to 
dispose of the little force we have in the field. I 
shall do the best I can, and keep your Excellency 
constantly advised of my situation. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> sets out to-morrow for the northward. Many officers think very favorably of his 
conduct, and that, whenever an inquiry takes place, 
he will honorably acquit myself 
</p><p>
I am, &c., 
</p><p>
