My dear General, 
</p><p>
The number of small frigates and privateers that 
are in the Bay, has made it impossible for me to carry the detachment farther down than <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a> ; and 
I have requested the Governor of Maryland, as well 
as the principal officers of the detachment, to give out 
that we were going to join <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>. But the 
object of the expedition is so perfectly known everywhere, that our sole dependence to keep Arnold must 
be upon the apprehension he has of a French fleet 
being cruising off the Capes. 
</p><p>
For my part, I came in a barge from <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, 
and, very luckily, escaped the dangers that were in 
the way. Colonel Harrison will have given to your 
Excellency a minute detail of the reasons which have 
prompted me to this measure. I have taken his advice in the matter, a,nd have no doubt but that your 
Excellency (considering the probability that no frigate would have been sent) will approve of the step 
I have taken, to forward as much as possible both 
the advantage of the expedition and the honor of 
the American arms. 
</p><p>
On my arrival yesterday afternoon, I found that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='colleague met'>Baron De Steuben</a> had been very active in making preparations, and, agreeably to what he tells 
me, we shall have five thousand militia ready to 
operate. This, with the Continental detachment, is 
equal to the business, and we might very well do 
without any land force from Newport. 
</p><p>
By papers found in the baggage of a British officer (taken in a boat), it seems that General Gregory 
had a correspondence with the enemy. The Baron has suspended liim, but lie is still with the troops. Arnold is so well acquainted with the coming of the 
detachment, and the object is so well known, that, as 
I said before, our only chance to keep him must be 
the idea of a French fleet being off the Capes. He 
is fortifying at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and trying to get provisions. There have been some trifling skirmishes with 
the militia. To my great disappointment, the French 
fleet have not yet appeared. If the project has not 
been given up, they must be expected every minute. 
They have had double the time which they wanted, 
and such winds as ought to have brought them in 
four days. 
</p><p>
I wanted to hold up the idea of my going to the 
southward ; but the Baron says that, if the detachment is not announced, the militia will desert. He 
wanted me to take the command immediately ; but I 
thought it more polite not to do it until the detachment arrives, or operations are begun. In your first 
letter to the Baron, I wish, my dear General, you 
would write to him that I have been much satisfied 
with his preparations. I want to please him, and 
harmony shall be my first object. As in all cases 
(even this of my going to the southward, and coming 
here to make arrangements with the Baron), I would 
reconnoitre the enemy's works, I will take an opportunity of doing it as soon as possible. They have 
not been, as yet, reconnoitred by the Baron, and I 
think it therefore more necessary for me to see with 
my own eyes. 
</p><p>
As I am just arrived, my dear General, I cannot 
give you a very exact account of matters. This letter I send by duplicate ; and have the honor to 
be, with the highest respect and most tender affection, &c., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="me">Lafayette</a>.
