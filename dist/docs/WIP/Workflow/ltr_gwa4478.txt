Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
No arguments were necessary to convince me of the very great public utility, which would result from the 
success of the plan you proposed laying before Congress. Had I been unapprized of the advantages, which might be derived to our cause from a successful 
attempt, or even a powerful diversion in that quarter, the reasons you have offered would have carried irrefragable demonstration with them, and induced me to 
be of your opinion. But the distressed and embarrassed state of our affairs, on account of supplies, with which you are well acquainted, the languid efforts of the 
States to procure men, and the insuperable difficulties in the way of transportation, would, I apprehend, have rendered the scheme abortive in the first instance. 
And I must inform you, that there is yet another obstacle, which makes the attempt you have suggested absolutely impracticable by the means you propose, but 
which I am not at liberty to commit to paper for fear of the same misfortune, which has already happened to some of my letters. 
</p><p>
You will have seen before the receipt of this, by my 
public letter to Congress of the 27th instant, the result of the deliberations of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> 
and myself at Weathersfield. That plan, upon the maturest consideration, and after combining all the present 
circumstances and future prospects, appeared, though 
precarious, far the most eligible of any we could possibly devise, whilst we are inferior at sea. The object was considered to be of greater magnitude, and 
more within our reach, than any other. The weakness 
of the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the central position for 
drawing together men and supplies, and the spur, which 
an attempt against that place, would give to every exertion, were among the reasons, which prompted to that 
undertaking, and promised the fairest prospect of success, unless the enemy should recall a considerable part 
of their force from the southward. And even in this 
case, the same measure, which might produce disappointment in one quarter, would certainly in the event 
afford the greatest relief in another. While an opportunity presents itself of striking the enemy a fatal blow, 
I will persuade myself, that the concurring exertions of 
Congress, of the several States immediately concerned, 
and of every individual in them, who is well affected 
to our cause, will be united in yielding every possible 
aid. At this crisis, while I rejoice at the appointment 
of the minister of finance, I have sincerely to regret, 
that the ministers of the other departments have not 
also been appointed, especially a minister of war. At 
the same time I am happy to learn, that the mode of 
promotion is on the point of being finally established. 
With the highest sentiments of regard, I am, &c.
