Dear Robert, 
</p><p>
Almost ever since my arrival here I have had, and still 
have, a sick family. The epidemic disorder which has 
spread through the northern part of Europe has been severe 
upon us. I am free from it at present, but it has taken from 
me some flesh and much strength. Mrs. Jay has frequent 
attacks of an irregular intermitting fever, and our little girl 
is not yet wholly out of danger. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 22d May, and the one enclosed with it 
from your good mother, contain the first advices I received 
of my father's death. My last letter from Frederick was 
of an earlier date. That intelligence was not unexpected. 
I wish I had been with him ; but it is a temporary separation, and I am resigned. It has added to the number of my 
inducements to walk in his steps, and thereby arrive at the 
same home. 
</p><p>
I feel very sensibly for Peter and Nancy. They are ever 
in my thoughts. I thank you sincerely for becoming my 
agent. <a href='/results.php?tla=ben' rel='colleague met'>Dr. Franklin</a> had paid me nine months' salary a 
few days before your letters arrived, and too great a part 
of it was pre-engaged to admit of my repaying it and waiting for bills. 
</p><p>
I must request the favour of you to pay twenty pounds 
York money to Miss Kitty Livingston on account of my 
little boy, and one hundred and fifty pounds like money to 
Frederick, Peter, and Nancy, â€” to each fifty pounds. Arrange this through Mr. Benson. I hear my father has 
given some of the servants free, and that some other of the 
older ones have been put out. Old servants are sometimes 
neglected. Desire Mr. Benson to keep an eye over them, 
and not let any of them want ; and for that purpose, place 
fifty pounds in his hands, which he will apply according to 
his discretion, as necessity may, from time to time, require. 
He must also reimburse himself for any expenses he may 
be at on this account. I should write to him also on this 
subject, but have neither health nor time, having at present 
a violent headache and a little fever, and my letter must be 
sent to the Marquis de La Fayette's this evening. Adieu, 
</p><p>
my friend. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.
