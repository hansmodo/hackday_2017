Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
As an opportunity of going to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> will not probably 
be given me during the session of the Legislature, and as I 
have too long kept you in suspense relative to the farm you 
was so kind as to offer me, I ought now to acquaint you 
that I am under a necessity of denying myself the pleasure 
of being your neighbour. My father's infirmities have so 
increased as to render a removal to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> so inconveniert and painful, if practicable, that he cannot prevail 
upon himself to undertake it. So that, my dear sir, filial 
obligations will constrain me to continue in his neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
He is greatly obliged by your friendly offer, and believe 
me, it will ever excite the gratitude of your obliged and 
</p><p>
Affectionate friend and servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=joj" rel="me">John Jay</a>.
