SIR, 
</p><p>
I have nothing in charge from Congress, at this 
time, but to transmit the inclosed resolves, and to re 
quest your attention to them. 
</p><p>
The information that the enemy have, at different 
times, compelled our troops, who are prisoners with 
them, to labor, and that a number are at this time 
actually engaged in throwing up some works at and 
near Kensington, is of such a nature that Congress 
think it incumbent on them to inquire into the truth 
of it. They have, therefore, directed that a flag be 
immediately despatched to General Howe, to know 
whether there is any foundation for the report; and 
I am to request you will send a flag for this purpose 
as soon as you conveniently can. M. Le Balme having desired leave of Congress to resign his commission as Inspector of the cavalry, they have accordingly complied with his request. I have the honor 
to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President.
