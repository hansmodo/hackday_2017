My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You ask what is the effect of the Veto. My impression 
is that it is working as well as the friends of the Bank and of 
the country could desire. I have always deplored making the 
Bank a party question, but since the President will have it 
so, he must pay the penalty of his own rashness. As to the 
Veto message I am delighted with it. It has all the fury of 
a chained panther biting the bars of his cage. It is really a 
manifesto of anarchy such as Marat or Robespierre might 
have issued to the mob of the faubourg St Antoine: and my 
hope is that it will contribute to relieve the country from 
the dominion of these miserable people. You are destined to 
be the instrument of that deliverance, and at no period of 
your life has the country ever had a deeper stake in you. I 
wish you success most cordially, because I believe the institutions of the Union are involved in it.
