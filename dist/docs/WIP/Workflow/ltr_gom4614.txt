Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure to acknowledge yours of the first of Au 
gust by a courier, who left this city a few hours after I received it. I hope this will find you well and happy in London. 
The young gentleman whom I mentioned to you as being about to come hither is arrived, so that we must wait for another 
conveyance for the packet. In the mean time be so kind as 
to let me know your address in London. Mine is Rue de la Planche, No. 488.

We have had here within these few days some serious 
scenes, at which I am not surprised, because I foresaw not 
only a struggle between the two corps, which the constitution 
had organized, viz. the executive (so called) and the legislative. But I was convinced that the latter would get the better. 
Such is the natural, and indeed the necessary order of things. 
It is nevertheless a painful reflection, that one of the finest 
countries in the world should be so cruelly torn to pieces. 
The storrn which lately raged is a little subsided, but the winds 
must soon arise again, and perhaps from the same, perhaps from 
another quarter. But that is of but little consequence, since 
in every case we must expect a little rage and devastation. A 
man, attached to his fellow men, must see with the same distress the woes they suffer, whether arising from an army or from 
a mob, and whether those by whom they are inflicted speak 
French or German.

An American has a stronger sympathy with this country 
than any other observer, and nourished as he is in the very 
bosom of liberty, he cannot but be deeply afflicted to see that 
in almost every event, this struggle must terminate in despotism. 
Yet such is the melancholy spectacle, which presents itself to 
my mind, and with which it has long been occupied. I eanestly wish and pray, that events may prove all my reasonings to have been fallacious, and all my apprehensions 
vain. I am, &c.
