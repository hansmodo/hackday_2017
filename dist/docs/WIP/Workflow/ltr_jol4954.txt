My Dear Father : 
</p><p>
The Chevalier de Cambray informs me that he sets 
out for York ; I must write precipitately to have my 
letter conveyed by him. 
</p><p>
The state of intelligence yesterday was as follows : 
That the baggage of the commissioners was packed 
up, their linnen ordered from the washerwomen 
finished or unfinished ; the troops in town were the 
third brigade which is composed of the Highlanders 
and two British regiments, a few Hessians, the grenadiers and light infantry, and the cavalry; all the 
vessels on the stocks had been burnt; some few 
houses had been maliciously fired at the same time ; 
the park of artillery was reduced to five field pieces 
and two howitzers; the horse tenders were at the 
wharves with slings, &ca., in readiness; the Vigilant 
and a few row galleys lay at the upper end of the 
town to cover the passage of the troops ; the commissary of the light horse had put all his baggage in his waggon ; orders had been given to the 3 d brigade to be 
in readiness for marching this morning at 2 o clock. 
This intelligence was given by a very faithful fellow 
whose mother washed for the commissioners, and 
who on former occasions has given us accurate and 
useful intelligence. This day, three deserters, one 
of them from the corps of grenadiers, confirmed many 
of the foregoing circumstances. A letter from Capt. McLane, dated at noon, informs me that all the 
enemy's park had crossed the river ; that the High 
landers were then crossing ; that he had marched 
towards the enemy's redoubts, caused several of them 
to be manned, and exchanged a few shot with a 
party that advanced in front of them. It is his 
opinion as well as that of others, that the city will be 
completely evacuated to-morrow. 
</p><p>
The prevailing opinion is, that one division of the 
army will march by way of <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, and another by 
a lower road, in marching through the Jersies. 
</p><p>
An account dated yesterday from the city says that 
the enemy have taken all the horses they could possibly collect; logs, planks, blocks, c., have been 
swept to form such magazines as they probably may 
want in the West Indies. 
</p><p>
My dearest friend, you will excuse this letter which 
has been written as fast as ever my hand could 
conduct my pen, and believe me ever your most 
affectionate 
</p><p>

Inclosed is a letter which Mr Morris desires may 
be forwarded to its address. 
</p><p>
Mr De Cottineau has presented the General with 
a very elegant plumage set in gold, with this celebrated address of Henry the 4th of France to his 
soldiers engraved on it : 
</p><p>
Ne perdez pas de vue mon Panache blanc ; vous le 
trouverez toujours au Chemin de 1 honeur et de la 
victoire. 
</p><p>
Don t lose sight of my white plumage, you will ever 
find it in the road which leads to honour and victory. 
</p>
