Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been favoured with yours of the 14th instant. It 
gives me pleasure to observe, that good-will towards 
America seems to prevail generally in this kingdom, and I 
hope the further progress of conciliation will not be retarded 
by indiscretions in either country. 
Your sentiments, relative to the imperfections of human 
nature and human governments, are but too well founded. 
Governments calculated on an idea that the great majority 
of any people are reasonable and virtuous will, in many 
respects, prove detective. Governments calculated on the 
opposite extreme will be severe and oppressive. When 
it is considered that not only all who form plans of government, and all who govern, and all who are governed, are 
imperfect, but also that too many of them are neither wise 
nor virtuous, we cannot be surprised that political as well 
as moral evil should abound more or less in every part of the 
world. Perfection is beyond our reach; all that can be 
hoped for in this world is a state of the least imperfection. 
</p><p>
With the best wishes for your welfare, 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
