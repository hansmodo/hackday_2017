MUCH RESPECTED GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your order, have again waited on 
Major Rogers, and strictly examined him. Have 
seen his several permits, and think them genuine, 
and in every respect agreeable to the copy sent you. 
He says he left <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> about the 10th of October, being ill with the fever-and-ague, was ten days 
in getting to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> ; that there, and at the place 
called Stone Arabia, he tarried ten days more ; he 
then passed through Iloosick, Standford, Draper, and 
Hinsdale, in his way to his brother, who lives in 
Kent ; he was three days in performing this route, 
and tarried with his brother five or six days more ; 
he was then three days in going to Westminster, and 
in his way passed through by Dartmouth College, 
and saw Mr. Wheelock ; from thence he went to his 
farm, in Pennicook, where he tarried six or eight 
days ; from thence he went to Newbury, and from 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and, after tarrying there some few days, laid his permit before the Committee of Safety. 
</p><p>
He owns every thing in Mr. Wheelock's letter except that of his having been in Canada, which he 
warmly denies, and says lie can prove the route he 
took, and prove himself to have been in the several 
towns at or near the days he has mentioned. I 
asked him why he came to the camps, as he had 
no business with any particular persons, and had no 
inclination to offer his service in the American cause; 
to which he replied, that he had voluntarily waited 
upon the Committees of several Colonies, as he thought it a piece of respect due to them, and would 
probably prevent his being suspected and treated as 
a person unfriendly to us ; that he likewise thought 
it his duty to wait on your Excellency, and acquaint 
you with the situation of his affairs, and, if he could, 
to obtain your license to travel unmolested. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are the facts as handed to me by him. 
What may be his secret designs I am unable to say, 
and what steps are most proper to be taken respecting  him, your Excellency can best judge. I am far 
from thinking that he has been in Canada ; but, as he 
was once Governor of Michilimackinac, it is possible 
he may have a commission to take that command, 
and stir up the Indians against us, and only waits 
for an opportunity to get there ; for which reason I 
would advise, lest some blame might be laid upon 
your Excellency in future, not to give him any other 
permit, but let him avail himself of those he has ; 
and, should he prove a traitor, let the blame centre 
upon those who enlarged him. I beg pardon for intruding my opinion; and subscribe myself 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,
