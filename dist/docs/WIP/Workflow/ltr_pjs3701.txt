Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obliging favor of the 23d of last 
month I had the pleasure to receive on the 31st following. It was exceedingly mortifying to me, that 
the Senate was so thin of members when your lady 
honored us with a visit, that my attendance could 
not be dispensed with, even for a day. I was, consequently, deprived of affording that attention which 
inclination, esteem, and the most friendly feelings, 
impelled me to. She saw my embarrassments, and, 
with a good nature and complaisance which at once 
charmed and captivated, made every allowance.

The motives which led Congress to postpone filling 
the War department have leaked out, and been communicated to me. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> was in nomination; 
but his friends, reflecting that the impropriety of appointing him before he had exculpated himself from 
the imputation of misconduct in his command, would 
be too glaring an abuse of power, deferred it, in 
hopes that, by an acquittal, the public confidence will 
be restored to him. But surely the gentlemen who 
intend him the office, neither consult his reputation 
nor the public interest. Not the former, because his 
inability to discharge it will certainly draw disgrace 
on him ; nor that of the latter, for, if even he was 
competent, he ought to be precluded, as the inveterate enmity which he bears to you, and which will 
influence him the more for being groundless, will lead 
him, without hesitation, to reject or thwart the most 
salutary measures you may propose. Gracious God! 
How much it is to be lamented that rulers, charged with the affairs of an empire, will sacrifice the best 
interests of their constituents to little, narrow-minded 
prejudices, and local politics, favorable only to their 
unworthy sycophants ! That they will close their eyes 
to the evident advantages which would result from 
choosing men to fill the great offices of the State, 
who have a mutual confidence in each other, and will 
give mutual support to every measure calculated to 
promote the public weal. The man in question, I 
fear, will also embarrass the Financier ; for he has not 
the least idea of public economy in his composition, 
nor do I believe that they entertain much esteem for 
each other. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely lament that a plan so judiciously 
formed as that you mention in conj&dence, should be 
defeated by those who would have reaped so much 
credit from the success which would, in all human 
probability, have ensued, and the glory of having 
rendered so essential a service to the allied powers.'' 
My heart realizes your feelings on the occasion, and 
cordially sympathizes with yours. You have the 
weakness of some, and the wickedness of others, to 
encounter; obstacles and embarrassments to surmount, 
which blunderers, with one object, and without system, daily create, as well as those vvdiich unavoidable 
accidents and events, which none can foresee, occasion. But I trust the day is rapidly advancing, when 
an astonished world will know what it would be improper to communicate now, and feel what they ought, 
an increase of gratitude, that best affection of the 
human heart. 
</p><p>
May your next despatches from the southern quarter relieve you from the disagreeable situation 
which the torture of doubt and suspense occasions, 
and announce some capital advantage over the enemy. Mrs. Schuyler and my daughter join me in affectionate regards to you and your lady. Be pleased 
to make my compliments acceptable to Colonel Harrison, and the other gentlemen of your family. I 
am, vith great esteem and regard, 
</p><p>
And most affectionately, &c., 
</p><p>
