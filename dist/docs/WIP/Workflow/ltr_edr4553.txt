Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter, of which I had the honor of enclosing a copy to 
you in mine of the twenty-eighth of April last, was written as 
soon as the application came from the French Minister here. 
The embargo, which continued from the twenty-fifth of March 
lo the twenty-fifth of May, has rendered it very uncertain, how 
much sooner than this you will receive the original of that. 
Colonel Monroe, your successor, will show to you a copy of 
my answer to M. Fauchet's demand, and the President's nomination of him. From all which you will collect, that the 
moving cause has been the irresistible call for an act of reciprocity. Under this impression, and with the knowledge of the 
sentiments of the President, I have not thought it necessary 
to prepare formal letters of recall, begging you to consider this, 
as the most respectful mode which I can devise, of communicating to you the new arrangement. 
</p><p>
The letter, now enclosed for taking leave, is sent solely for 
the sake of form and your own accommodation ; and it may 
be delivered or not, as you think proper. I have the honor 
to be, with great respect and esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient servant, 
</p><p>
