My Dear Friend, 
</p><p>
I am preparing for my departure ; but as yet can take no 
step, because there is a kind of interregnum in the government, 
and Mr Monroe is not yet received ; at which he grows some 
what impatient. The intelligence you give me respecting 
myself is particularly pleasing. I desired much to be recalled, but I would not ask it, because I conceived my honor concerned in seeing the thing out. My only remaining wish is, 
that the measure may be as useful to the United States as it is 
pleasing to me. I am, &ic.
