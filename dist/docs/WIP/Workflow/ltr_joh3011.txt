SIR, 
</p><p>
You will see, from the inclosed resolves, which I do 
myself the pleasure of forwarding, in obedience to 
the commands of Congress, that they have bent their 
whole attention to our affairs in Canada, and have 
adopted such measures, as, in their opinion, are calculated to place them on a better and more reputable footing for the future. 
</p><p>
The most unfortunate death of General Thomas 
having made a vacancy in that department, and the 
service requiring an officer of experience and distinction, the Congress have thought proper to appoint 
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> to succeed him. And I am to request 
you will send him into that Province, to take the 
command of the forces there, as soon as possible; and 
that you direct him to view Point-au-Fer, and to 
order a fortress to be erected there, if he shall think 
proper. 
</p><p>
My opinion on the resolve of the 25th May was 
well founded ; Congress having since determined, as 
you will find by a resolve herewith transmitted, that 
you are to employ the Indians wherever you think 
their services will contribute most to the public good. 
</p><p>
I shall write to the Colonies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New 
Jersey, and Connecticut, to request them to author 
ize you to call on their militia, if necessary. My 
time will not permit me to do it now, as the post 
will set out directly, and the inclosed resolves were 
not passed till late yesterday evening. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient 
and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joh" rel="me">JOHN HANCOCK</a>, President. 
</p><p>
P, S. A Mustermaster-General, in the room of Mr. Moylan, will be appointed this day or to-morrow, and a Deputy will afterwards be sent into Canada. 
</p><p>
I beg you will think of the Eastern Department, with respect to General Officers, when your very important concerns will admit. 
</p>
