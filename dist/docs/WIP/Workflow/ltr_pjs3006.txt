DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The day after I did myself the honor to write your Excellency from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I set out for this place and arrived here on the 30th ultimo, much 
indisposed with a bilious fever. Next day I followed <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a>, whom I overtook on the 4th instant at the Isle-la-Motte, he having "been 
detained by adverse winds and rainy weather. On 
that day we moved on to Isle-aux-Noix, twelve miles 
south of St. John's. On the 5th I drew a Declaration, (but was so ill that it is not such as I could 
wish, a copy of which you have inclosed,) which I 
sent into Canada by Major Brown and Mr. Allen; 
and as we judged that going to St. John's, weak as 
we were, (our numbers not exceeding one thousand, 
and the little artillery we had not come up,) might 
have a good effect on the Canadians and encourage them to join us, we resolved upon the measure, 
and landed our baggage and provisions, except for 
four days, and early on the 6th embarked, and, with 
out any obstructions, proceeded towards St. John's. 
When we arrived in sight of it, and at the distance 
of about two miles, the enemy began to cannonade, 
but did us no damage. We approached half a mile 
nearer and then landed without opposition, in a close, 
deep swamp, which extended to very near the fort. 
Here we formed, and marched in the best order 
we could towards the fort, to reconnoitre. Major 
Hobby, of Waterbury s, with a detachment flanked 
the left wing, and was something advanced before 
the main body, when he was attacked, in crossing a 
deep muddy brook, by a party of Indians, from 
whom he received a heavy fire; but our men pushing  on, they soon gave way and left us the ground. 
In the rencounter we had a sergeant, a corporal, 
and three privates killed, and one missing ; eight privates wounded, three of whom died the ensuing 
night; Major Hobby shot through the thigh, Captain 
Mead through the shoulder, and Lieutenant Brown in the hand. These gentlemen are all out of danger. Night coming on, and the swamp being almost 
impassable, we drew our men together, and east up a 
small intrenchment to defend ourselves in case of an 
attack in the night. In the evening a gentleman, 
Mr. (whose name I can only mention to your Excellency, not having even ventured it to the Congress, and therefore beg you to erase the scored part of the letter after persual,) came to me and 
| gave me the following account; "That there were 
no regular troops in Canada, but the twenty-sixth 
regiment; that all these, except fifty at Montreal, 
were at St. John's and Chamblee ; that there were 
then at St. John's about one hundred Indians, and 
that there was a considerable body with Colonel 
Johnson; that the fortifications were complete and 
strong, and plentifully furnished with cannon; that 
the vessel was launched, and had one mast in and 
the other ready to raise; that she would be ready 
to sail in three or four days, and is to carry six 
teen guns; that he does not believe that our army 
will be joined by one Canadian; that they wish 
to be neuter on the occasion, but if we should 
penetrate into Canada, it would not displease them, 
provided their persons and properties were safe, and 
w r e paid them in gold and silver for what we had ; 
that in the situation we were in he judged it 
would be imprudent to attack St. John's, and advised us to send some parties amongst the inhabit 
ants, and the remainder of the army to retire to 
the Isle-aux-Noix, from whence we might have an 
intercourse with Laprairie. He told me that in 
the afternoon's engagement five Indians were killed 
and four badly wounded, besides several others the 
condition of whose wounds he did not know, and Captain Tyce, of Johnstown, who was "badly wounded in the belly." 
</p><p>
On the 7th, in the morning, (having "been undisturbed through the night excepting by a few shells, 
which did no other damage than slightly wounding  Lieutenant Mills,) I called a council of war 
of all the field officers present, to whom I communicated the information I had received, and in 
close a copy of their opinion, which, being perfectly consonant to my own, I immediately ordered the troops to embark, and we retired. 
</p><p>
On my return to Isle-aux-Noix I immediately 
began to fortify the place, and to throw a boom 
across the channel, until my artillery should come 
up. On the 9th I received a letter from Canada, 
without signature, but which I knew to be writ 
ten by Mr. James Livingston (copy inclosed). As 
I had through other channels a collaboration of 
the intelligence contained in the former part of his 
letter, I resolved, as I had not yet iny artillery, 
to detach five hundred men into Canada, and gave 
orders on the 9th for their embarkation on the 10th, 
with an additional number of about three hundred, 
to cover their landing and bring back the boats. 
(Copy of my instructions to the commanding officer 
inclosed.) 
</p><p>
For the event of this intended expedition, see the paper which was drawn and delivered me by 
one of the party, and, from what I can learn, is just. 
</p><p>
This body returned on Monday, the 11th. On 
Tuesday, the 12th, I found I had upwards of six 
hundred sick, Waterbury's regiment being reduced 
to less than five hundred. <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> (for 
I was too ill to leave my bed) perceived, however, with pleasure, that the men were unable to 
bear the reproach of their late unbecoming behaviour ; and, taking advantage of this happy return 
to a sense of their duty, on the 13th I issued the orders contained in the paper Number Six. The 14th proved rainy, and retarded the embarkation of the cannon. On this day Colonel Allen 
arrived and made the report, Number Seven; and I 
found myself so much better that I had hopes of 
moving with the army, but by ten at night my 
disorder reattacked me with double violence, and 
every fair prospect of a speedy recovery vanished. 
Great part of the 15th rainy, the embarkation 
much retarded by it. On the same day I received 
the letter of which Number Eight is a copy. On 
the 16th I was put into a covered boat, and left 
Isle-aux-Noix ; and as it rained part of the day, I 
do not suppose that <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> could 
move until the 17th, which proved fair. 
</p><p>
The mode of the intended attack on St. John's, 
as judged best both by <a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=rim' rel='colleague met'>General Montgomery</a></a> and 
myself was as follows; to land as near the fort 
as we did the first time we went down ; the two 
row-galleys carrying a twelve-pounder each, and well 
manned; the sloop and schooner and ten bateaux 
with picked men, to lay in the river, ready to 
attack the enemy's schooner (which is complete and 
carries sixteen guns) in case she should attempt 
to destroy our boats, or get to the southward of 
them, and thereby effectually cut off all communication between this place and the army. After 
this naval arrangement (which will take three hundred and fifty men), five hundred men to be sent 
as a corps of observation to intercept any succours 
between St. John's and Chamblee, and to keep as 
near the former as possible; two hundred men at 
the proposed landing to cover the boats and secure 
a retreat for the men in the vessels and boats, 
should the enemy's vessel [intercept them] ; the remainder of the army to invest the place, make the 
approaches, and erect the batteries. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, by Number Five, that some of 
the enemy's boats fired on our people. Captain 
Douglas, who commands one of our armed boats, 
pointed and fired a twelve-pounder, loaded with ball 
and grape-shot, at them, and we have accounts that 
about thirty of the unfriendly Canadians were killed 
or drowned. In the first engagement, on the 7th, 
we killed them six Indians, two Caghnawagas, as 
many Mohawks, (Daniel, and Williani, a bastard 
son of Sir William Johnson s,) one Connasadago, 
and one Huron; and w j e are informed, by a Caghnawaga and Huron whom I left at Isle-aux-Noix, 
that not an Indian remained at St. John's, and 
which I believe to be true. Four deputies, who 
were sent by the Six Nations, and left Isle-aux-Noix 
on the 10th, to request the Canadian Indians to remain neuter, were not returned when I left Isle-aux-Noix. I have taken the liberty to desire General 
Montgomery to make a present, in the name of the 
Congress, to the Canadian Indians, if he should 
think it necessary. 
</p><p>
Since the affair of the 10th, the army at Isle-aux-Noix, which then consisted of thirteen hundred and 
ninety-four effectives, all ranks included, has been 
reinforced by Captain Livingston's company of New 
Yorkers, nearly complete; on the 16th, by Colonel 
Warner, whom I met, an hour after my departure 
with one hundred and seventy Green Mountain Boys 
(being the first that have appeared of that boasted corps) ; he left this with about fifty more, "but they 
mutinied, and the remainder are at Crown Point. 
Captain Allen's company, of the same corps, arrived 
here last night, every man of which was raised in 
Connecticut. About one hundred men of Colonel 
Bedel's, from New Hampshire, (his corps was to 
have been up a fortnight before, the remainder, one 
hundred and fifty of that body, were yet to come) 
joined, the 16th, at night; and I suppose the artillery company, under Captain Lamb, will join them 
to-day. These last were indispensably necessary, as 
we had none that knew r any thing of the matter; so 
that the whole reinforcement consists of about four 
hundred. Yesterday I sent off sixty of Easton s, and 
one hundred and forty more are just embarking; 
this is the whole of that corps. About one hundred 
and twenty-five, of the first <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> battalion, will 
embark early to-morrow, together with the company 
of Green Mountain Boys, consisting of about seventy. 
</p><p>
Two hundred and sixty, of the third <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> battalion, remain here, which I will forward on as 
soon as I can procure craft, which is building slowly, as most of the carpenters are gone home sick. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter, of the 8th instant, I received yesterday. I am happy to learn that the 
troops under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Arnold</a></a> were to march so soon. I hope our people will commit 
no depredations in Canada; all possible care will be taken of it; but yet I have many fears on that 
score, as they stole thirty-two sheep at Isle-aux-Noix, contrary to the most pointed orders. 
</p><p>
Be assured, Sir, that I shall not fail of giving you 
the most early intelligence of every occurrence worthy your attention. 
</p><p>
I find myself much better, as the fever has left 
me, and hope soon to return where I ought and 
wish to be, unless a "barbarous relapse should dash 
this cup of hope from my lips. 
</p><p>
The number of sick is incredible, and I have 
very little assistance to afford them. I wish I could 
make you a return of the army under my command; but I cannot get one; a great deal of foul 
play is carrying on. 
</p><p>
I am indebted to General Lee and <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'><a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague met'>Colonel Reed</a></a> 
for a letter, but I am too feeble to write. Be 
pleased to assure them of my respect, and be so 
good as to make my compliments acceptable to all 
the gentlemen of your suite. I am, dear Sir, your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and most 
</p><p>
Humble servant, 
</p><p>
