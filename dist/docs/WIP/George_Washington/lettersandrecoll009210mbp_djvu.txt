INTRODUCTION. 

The letters from George Washington to my grand- 
father, Tobias Lear, included in this volume, are inter- 
esting as showing a side of that great man's character 
new to the public. His mastery of detail in domestic 
life appears to have been as remarkable as his power to 
conduct the affairs of a great nation. 

His confidence in my grandfather is proved by these 
letters to him if proof is needed. He entrusted him 
with the management of those household details so 
interesting and important in his eyes. Tobias Lear 
was born in 1760 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; he 
graduated from Harvard in 1783, entering at once upon 
the duties of tutor to Washington's adopted children, 
afterwards becoming his private secretary, in which 
capacity he remained for sixteen years, or until Wash- 
ington's death. He was also his military aide, with 
rank of Colonel, when such services were needed. Be- 
sides his professional position, he had a higher standing 
in the family through marriage. After the death of 
his first wife Mary Long, of Portsmouth, N. H., my 
own grandmother he married Fanny Washington; 
and again, after her death, Frances Dandridge Henley, 
a niece of Martha Washington. Through this last 



marriage, I became the possessor of a very valuable and 
unique quilt, made by Mrs. Washington's wn hands, 
which was used on George Washington's bed. The min- 
iature of Washington here reproduced was presented to 
Tobias Lear by Martha Washington, after her husband's 
death. It has a large lock of his hair at the back of it. 
The miniature of Tobias Lear is a remarkably fine one, 
painted by Cottoni, an Italian. The setting is of gold, 
bordered by a narrow band of blue enamel, edged on 
each side by seed pearls. 

Tobias Lear's only child my father was christened 
Benjamin Lincoln, after General Lincoln. My grand- 
father writes, in a letter to William Atkinson: "Our 
boy has the name of Benjamin Lincoln in memory of 
my true friend and one of the best of men. Many 
express their surprise that a son of mine, born too in 
this family, should receive any other name than that of 
George Washington. But altho' I love & respect the 
great man who bears that name, yet I would not for 
the world do a thing that could savour of adulation 
toward him and if I would not adulate him I am sure 
I would adulate no human being/' 

Washington was this child's godfather, presenting 
him with a silver pap-cup and spoon. Unfortunately, 
the cup was stolen. 

The locket here shown, containing a lock of my 
grandmother's hair, is of glass, set in gold, upon which 
is engraved the date of her death, and "To B. L L. 
from his friend M. Washington. "

/*-- " 

Tobias Lear evidently had, in a quiet way, consider- 
able influence over Washington. The diary mentions 
the fact of his moderating Washington's excitement 
over something he was reading in the paper. It was 
also through his persuasions that his New England trip 
was taken. 

I have written this short introduction to show in 
what high esteem Washington held Lear. As to my 
grandfather's affection for Washington, the diary 
shows. 

I was defrauded of the originals of these letters.

GEORGE WASHINGTON 

No. i 

PHILADELPHIA, Septr. 5th. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

After a pleasant journey we arrived in this City about 
2 o'clock on Thursday last. To morrow we proceed 
(if Mrs. Washington's health will permit, for she has 
been much indisposed since she came here) towards 
Mount Vernon. 

The house of Mr. R. Morris had, previous to my ar- 
rival, been taken by the Corporation for my residence. 
It is the best they could get. It is, I believe, the best 
Single house in the City; yet without additions, it is in- 
adequate to the commodious accommodations of my 
family. These, I believe will be made. 

The first floor contains only two public Rooms (ex- 
cept one for the upper Servants). The second floor 
will have two public (drawing) Rooms & with the aid 
of one Room with the partition in it, in the back build- 
ing will be sufficient for the accommodation of Mrs. 
Washington & the children & their maids besides 
affording me a small place for a private study and dress- 
ing room. The third story will furnish you and Mrs. 
Lear with a good lodging Room, a public office (for 
there is no place below for one) and two Rooms for the 
Gentlemen of the family. The Garret has four good 
Rooms which must serve Mr- and Mrs. Hyde (unless 
they should prefer the Room over the Wash house), 



4 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

William and such servants as it may not be better to 
place in the addition (as proposed) to the back building. 
There is a room over the Stable (without a fireplace, 
but by means of a Stove) may serve the Coachman & 
Postillions ; and there is a smoke house, which possi- 
bly may be more useful to me for the accommodation 
of Servants, than for smoking of meat. The intention of 
the addition to the back Building is to provide a Ser- 
vants' Hall, and one or two (as it will afford) lodging 
Rooms for the Servants, especially those who are 
coupled. There is a very good Wash house adjoining 
the Kitchen (under one of the Rooms already men- 
tioned). There are good Stables, but for 12 horses 
only, and a Coach house which will hold all my 
Carriages. 

Speaking of Carriages, I have left my Coach to re- 
ceive a thorough repair against I return (which I expect 
will happen before the first of December) and I request 
you will visit Mr. Clark (into whose hands it is com- 
mitted) often, to see it well done ; and that I may not 
be disappointed in the time allowed him for the com- 
pletion, which is by the 25th. of November. The har- 
ness is also left with him, and he has my Ideas on this 
subject: generally they are, if the wheel harness 
(which I understand was left at New York) can be 
made complete, and look as well as if they were new, 
then & in that case, he is to make a set of pole-end Har- 
ness to suit them, both to be plated but if this can- 
not be accomplished, the set is to be made entirely new, 
and in the best style. 

I have requested Colo. Biddle to take measure for 
laying in wood for me, this being, he thinks, the proper 
time for doing it, & to draw upon you for the amount 
of Cost. 

The pressure of business under which I laboured for 
several days before I left New York, allowed me no 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 5 

time to enquire who of the female servants it was pro- 
posed or thought advisable to remove here, besides 
the wives of the footmen, namely, James and Fidas. 
The Washerwomen, I believe, are good, but as they, 
or one of them at least, has a family of children quere, 
whether it is necessary to incumber the march, and 
the family afterwards with them? I neither contradict 
or advise the measure your own judgment, and the 
circumstances of the case must decide the point: but 
unless there is better reason than I am acquainted with 
for bringing Mrs. Lewis, her daughter and their fami- 
lies along, they had better, I should conceive, be left : 
but as I never investigated the subject, I will give no 
decisive opinion thereon. 

As Mr. Hyde some little time before I left New York 
expressed dissatisfaction, signifying he could neither 
enjoy under the conduct of the servants the happiness 
he wished, or render those services he thought might 
be expected from him, it might be well for you before 
I am at the expense of his removal, to know decidedly 
what his determination is, and his views with respect 
to a continuance. There can be no propriety in sad* 
ling me with the cost of his transportation, & that of 
his baggage, if he has it in contemplation to leave me 
at, or soon after his arrival. And I am the rather in- 
clined to make this suggestion now as time will allow 
you to scrutinize his accounts, and to form a good com- 
parative view of them, with Francis's. As a steward, 
I am satisfyed William (independent of the woman, 
& what her excellence is I really know not) would be 
full his equal and I think the dinners, if the Cook had 
more agency in the planing of them, would be better ; 
at least more tasty, but this Mr. and Mrs. Hyde's 
pride will not submit to- As I have got to the end of 
the paper and am tired, I shall only add that your let- 
ter of the 3d* with its enclosures came safe and that

Mrs. Washington joins me in best wishes for Mrs. Lear

P. S. ' 

In a fortnight or 20 days from this time, it is ex- 
pected Mr. Morris will have removed out of the house. 
It is proposed to add bow windows to the two public 
Rooms in the South front of the house, but as all the 
other apartments will be close and secure the sooner 
after that time you can be in the house, with the fur- 
niture, the better, that you may be well fixed and see 
how matters go on during my absence. 
MR. LEAR.

BALTIMORE, Septr, gth. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

Agreeably to the information given in my last, I 
left Philadelphia on Monday and arrived here yesterday 
afternoon. To day I rest. To morrow I proceed, and 
hope to arrive safe at Mount Vernon on Saturday, 
after taking dinner at Abingdon, on our way. 

In order that you may not be too fast or too slow in 
your removal to Philadelphia, it might be well to open 
a correspondence with Mr. Morris, requesting him to 
inform you at what time the house will be ready to re- 
ceive the furniture, because it is proposed as I was in-* 
formed after writing to you on Sunday last, to have the 
Rooms painted after Mr. Morris should have left it. 
I would not let the bow windows, or any other addi* 
tion to the house, or any of the out buildings be any 
impediment to your removal, for you will have suffi- 
cient Room to stow the furniture (intended for the two 
large Rooms) in some other parts of the house ; and for 
all those who will accompany you ; and by being on the 
spot you will have it more ia your power to provide 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON* 7 

wood, and make such other arrangements as shall be 
found necessary, than you can do at a distance, 
besides accomplishing the main point (that is, the 
removal) before the weather becomes cold and intem- 
perate. 

In my last I left it with you to decide on the pro- 
priety of bringing the Washer women. I do so still. 
But with respect to Mrs. Lewis and her daughter, I 
wish it may not be done, especially as it is in contem- 
plation to transplant Hercules or Nathan from the 
Kitchen at Mount Vernon to that in Philadelphia; and 
because the dirty figures of Mrs. Lewis and her 
daughter will not be a pleasant sight in view (as the 
Kitchen always will be) of the principal entertaining 
rocms in our new habitation. 

Upon a second conversation with Mr. Clark, the 
Coach maker, it was concluded to have the Harness for 
the Coach quite new and plated ; and I should be glad 
if you would see that they are handsomely executed. 
He is to make harness for the pole-end as well as for the 
wheel horses, & promises that every thing shall be 
completed by the middle of November. 

Mr. and Mrs. Morris have insisted upon leaving the 
two large looking Glasses which are in their best Rooms, 
because they have no place (they say) proper to re- 
move them to, and because they are unwilling to 
hazzard the taking of them down. You will therefore 
let them have, in place of them, the choice of mine. 
The large ones which I purchased from the French 
Minister they do not incline to take ; but will be glad of 
some of the others. They also will leave a large Glass 
lamp in the entry or Hall, and will take one or more of 
my Glass lamps in lieu of it. In disposing of the Yards 
Mr Morris will take in (to the House he removes to; 
the part which formerly belonged to it. I mention 
this that you may not be surprised at the attempt.

MOUNT VERNON, Septr. xyth. 1790- 
Dear Sir, 

Having received no letter from you since the one 
dated the 3d Instant, I have nothing to reply to. The 
motive for writing to you at this time is, that upon un- 
packing the china ornaments which accompanied the 
mirrors for the Tables, it was found (notwithstanding 
they were in Bran) that many of the delicate and tender 
parts were broken; occasioned, I believe, by the Bran 
not being put in and settled down by a little at a time. 
To press the Bran around the Images (you have to re- 
move with the platteaux) will not answer ; still it must 
be so compact as to prevent friction, in moving; and 
this can only be done by putting each Image or figure 
in a separate box, with Bran, by little and little, 
shaking and settling it by degrees as it is added. 

By a letter which Major Jackson has received from 
General Steward, he has completed his removal, & Mr* 
Morris had begun to take things out of the house I am 
to have, to make room for my furniture, but as Mr. 
Morris was desired, so I am persuaded he will inform 
you when it will be safe and proper for you to remove. 
The sooner I think it can be done the better; as you 
will be able to make such arrangements, and provide 
such conveniences as you will know we shall want, and 
which (I suppose) through the channels they are now 
making, may be accomplished. 

We have resolved to take one of my Cooks with us, 
and if upon examining into the matter it shall be found 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 9 

convenient, I may also take .on a boy; at any rate, 
there will be no occasion for Mrs. Lewis or her daughter; 
for a Scullion may always be had in Philadelphia. 

In one of my former letters I suggested to you the' 
propriety of knowing decidedly what Mr. Hyde's views 
are before he is removed from New York at my expence, 
and I now repeat it : first, because it is necessary for 
me to be placed upon a certainty; and secondly, be- 
cause if he has any difficulties or doubts or has it in 
contemplation to talk in a short time (which is but too 
common a case) of increased wages, it would be best 
to separate at once, as well for these reasons as the one 
I communicated in a former letter and because I fear 
his Table is a much more expensive one than it ought to 
be. But as this is conjecture only, I will not charge 
him with it tho' I think the short duration of the 
first Pipe of Pintard wine, is a pretty evident proof 
that that article was expended more expeditiously than 
it ever was in Francis's time. How it has been with 
other things if you have been able to compare the 
accts. of the one with the other, you must be the best 
judge. 

We arrived safe at this place on Saturday last, but 
not without one upset of the Charriot and Waggon 
fortunately neither was hurt. We all unite in best 
wishes for you and Mrs. Lear, and I am your sincere 
friend and affectionate Servant, 

Take measure either by yourself or through 
Colo. Biddle to engage Wood in season & whilst 
it is to be obtained on good terms.

MOUNT VBRNON, Septr. 2oth. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 
The Servant who carried my letter of the i yth. to the 



io LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Post office in Alexandria, returned with yours of the 
isth. which shall be the Subject for this reply. 

What ever Ideas or remarks may have been excited 
by my going into Mr. Morris's house I know not, but 
this I am sure of, that to do it was farthest from my ex- 
pectations. The Corporation of the City (by whom it 
was engaged) made attempts it seems to get other 
places, but none being to be obtained to their Eking, 
Mr. Morris's was offered, and accepted, subject to my 
decision. To the Academy there were exceptions 
which it was said could not be overcome. To Hunter's 
Houses there were impediments. The Houses of Mrs. 
Allan and Mr. Guirney could not be had because Mrs. 
Pollock (tenant in the latter) would not relinquish it, 
and Mr. or Mrs. Kepley's was found not to answer. 
This, I was told, was the history of the business. 

I have not the least objection to Fida's wife's coming 
to Philadelphia in the vessel with the other servants; 
nor to her continuing in the family afterwards, if she 
chuses it and can do the duties of her station tolerably, 
because I think he merits indulgence on James' account 
(who I also think is a very good servant) I consent read- 
ily, if it was his expectation & wish that his wife may 
accompany the servants in the manner suggested by 
you, or as a house maid if she is thought fit for it; 
but not being acquainted with the views of the parties 
(James and Wife I mean) I can only say that I shall be 
perfectly satisfied with whatever you do respecting the 
matter. As I do not believe the House can be better 
supplied with Washer women, I think it best to bring 
those you have ; on condition that I shall not be bur- 
thened with Fanny's children after they arrive. Thus 
much for the lower Servants and their connections. 

With respect to Mr. Hyde and his wife, if the duties 
of the family are too much for both, will Mr. Hyde 
alone be able to discharge them? If she quits, will not 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON n 

a substitute be necessary? In that case or in case Mr, 
Hyde acts alone, does he expect the same wages as are 
now given to both? If it is not stated on some paper 
handed in by Mr, Hyde, it is nevertheless strong in my 
recollection, that his wife's services were stated at one, 
and his own at 200 dollars per Annum. I have no wish 
to part with Mr. or Mrs. Hyde, first because I do not 
like to be changing; and secondly because I do not 
know where or with whom to supply their places. On 
the score of the accts. I can say nothing never having 
taken a comparative view of his and Frauncis's, but I 
am exceedingly mistaken if the expences of the second 
Table at which Mr. Hyde presides, has not greatly ex- 
ceeded that kept by Frauncis ; for (but in this I may be 
mistaken) I strongly suspect that nothing is brought to 
my Table of liquors, fruits or other things that is not 
used as profusely at his. If my suspicions are un- 
founded, I shall be sorry for having entertained them, 
and if they are not, it is at least questionable, whether 
his successor might not do the same thing ; in which 
case (if Hyde is honest and careful, of which you are 
better able to judge than I am) a change without a 
benefit might take place, and is not desirable, if they 
are to be retained on proper terms. I say they, for if 
Mrs. Hyde is necessary for the purposes innumerated 
in your letter, and the Cook is not competent to the 
desert, making Cake, &c. I do not see what use Hyde, 
more than William, would be without her nor do I 
see why she should execute part of his duties and there- 
by make her own too burthensome. Francis, besides 
being an excellent Cook, knowing how to provide gen- 
teel Dinners, and giving aid in dressing them, pre- 
pared the desert, made the Cake, and did every thing 
that Hyde and Wife conjointly do; consequently, the 
services of Hyde alone, are not to be compared with 
those of Francis, and if his accts. exceed (in the same 



12 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

seasons) those of Frauncis 4 or $ a week and at the 
same time appear fair, I shall have no scruple to ac- 
knowledge that I have entertained much harder 
thoughts of the latter than I ought to have done, altho' 
it is inconceivable to me how other families on 25 hd. 
or 3000 dollars should be enabled to entertain more 
company, at least more frequently, than I could do 
for twenty five thousand dollars annually. 

I am glad to hear that the furniture of the large 
drawing Room, especially the Glasses, are packed in a 
manner which you think secure. With respect to the 
Table ornaments, my opinion has been so fully given on 
the mode of putting them up, that I shall say nothing 
further on the subject in this letter, and as I presume a 
correspondence has been opened between Mr. Morris 
and you, I have no doubt of your embracing the proper 
moment for their removal, & the best mode of accom- 
plishing it. 

Mr. Macomb may in reality be indifferent as to the 
taking the House off your hands but it is highly prob- 
able he will assume the appearance of it, in order to 
derive an advantage in the terms, therefore as I shall 
have to pay rent for it until May, if he or some other 
does not take it, it would be well to bring him to some 
decision at once or advertise the renting of it, and the 
sale of the buildings I have put up at the same time. 
You will make better terms for these than any Agent 
that will be left behind & besides, it may hasten Mr. 
Macomb (who from what I have heard I'm sure wants 
the house) by alarming his fears, that others may step 
in. To receive some compensation would be better 
than to sink the whole rent & to lose the buildings 
which I have erected on the lots. If there is no like- 
lihood of my getting a tenant for the house you are in, 
would not Mr. Macomb be glad to take it at the dif- 
ference which disinterested and impartial men would 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 13 

fix: between it and the house he is in and for me to pay 
the rent of the latter until a Tenant for it could be ob- 
tained? This would be a step gained and is perhaps 
what he is driving at. 

With respect to Dingwell I join Colo. Hamilton & 
Mr. Jefferson in opinion, that it is no more than a 
catchpenny plan, yet, for the reason assigned by 
Genl. Knox, I think twenty or thirty dollars may be 
given him, professedly for his trouble; withanassur* 

ance that it is believed B has meant an imposition 

on him, in as much as part of his information we know 
is unfounded, & am sure from the complexion & ex- 
pression of some of the letters, pretended to be re- 
ceived from some of the King of G. B.'s Ministers, 
that they are spurious. Yet, nevertheless, as it is 
supposed that he, Dingwell, meant well, and has been 
at some trouble in his report, this sum is given 
expressly on those accts. 

We have all of us been very well since we came to 
this place and all join in best wishes for you and Mrs. 
Lear, 

With sincere regard & affecn. 
I am, Yrs. &ca.

MOUNT VERNON, Septr. 27th. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

Since my last to you (the date I do not recollect, 
keeping no copies of my letters to you) I have reed, 
yours of the i7th.&2oth. Inst. and shall answer such 
parts of them as require it. 

I am glad to find that the house according to Mr. 
Morris's notification to you will be ready about the 
time you had made arrangements for the removal of my 
furniture, the mode of doing which, is, I am persuaded, 



i 4 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

the cheapest and best. How have you disposed (for 
safety) of the Pagoda? It is a delicate piece of stuff 
and will require to be tenderly handled. 

I expected that Mr. Macomb, if he found that no 
other person was disposed to take the house off my 
hands, would endeavor to impose his own terms: and 
allowing me only 100 for seven months use of it, when 
the rent (independent of the houses I put on the lots) 
is ^400, is a pretty strong evidence of it. And if you 
do not take some measures to see what can be had for 
the Wash house and Stable, he will impose his own 
terms there also. But after all, we are in his power, 
and he must do as he pleases with us. 

As the Lustre is paid for & securely packed up and 
may suit the largest drawing Room at Mr. Morris's, I 
do not incline to part with it; the Franklin Stoves and 
other fixtures, if they cannot be disposed of without 
loss, must be brought round with the other furniture: 
we may find use for them. Such things as are freighted 
in the common way (if the vessel you desired Colo. 
Biddleto procure is unable to carry the whole) had 
better be of the kinds which require least care. 

The sale of the old Charriot was proper, for although 
the price is small it will be so much saved for the public. 
If much worn or lumbering articles could be disposed 
of to any tolerable account, might it not be better to 
sell them at New York & buy (if necessary) new ones 
at Philadelphia, than to pay freight for them round? 

Mrs. Morris has a mangle (I think they are called) 
for Ironing of Clothes, which, as it is fixed in the place 
where it is commonly used, she proposed to leave and 
take mine. To this I have no objection provided 
mine is equally good and convenient; but if I should 
obtain any advantage, besides that of its being up, and 
ready for use, I am not inclined to receive it. 

Mrs. Washington and all of this family unite in best

wishes for you and Mrs. Lear, and I am your sincere

MOUNT VERNON, OCTR. 3d. 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letters of the 22d. Ulto. came safe. I wish the 
information given by Mr. Danl. Parker to Doctr. Crai- 
gee may prove true. No mention of such event is in 
Morris's letter to me, but the date is prior to that of Mr. 
Parker's by six days. The declaration and counter- 
declaration of the Minister of Britain and Spain are 
published with the Communication thereof to the Lord 
Mayor of London; and yet it seems to be the opinion of 
some of the Paragrphists, that the matter remains un- 
settled. Further information (not contained in the 
News papers) of these or any other interesting matters, 
you would do well to give me the earliest intelligence of. 
Mr. Jefferson being from New York will more than prob- 
able delay official advices through the Office of Foreign 
Affairs longer than it otherwise would be in coming to 
me- 

I request after you get to Philadelphia and previous 
to our arrival there, that you would use your best en- 
deavours to ascertain the characters or reputation of 
such schools as it may be proper to place Washington 
at, so soon as we shall be fixed in our new habitation; 
particularly if there be any fit school in the College 
for him, under good and able' Tutors, & well attended. 
His trip to Mount Vernon will be of no service to him, 
but will render restraint more necessary than ever. If 
the College is under good regulations, and have proper 
tutors there for boys of his standing to prepare them 
for the higher branches of education, quere, whether it

Would not be better to place him in it at once? the pre- 
sumption being that a System prevails, by which the 
gradations are better connected than they are in Schools 
which have no correspondence with each other. Mr. 
S is a man of acknowledged abilities but it may not 
be well perhaps to say more in a letter, especially as 
his re-instatement may have given rise to a reform of 
that conduct which did not escape censure formerly. 

The enclosed letters having been put under cover 
to me, will of course occasion delay in the receipt of 
them by you & Fidas. In all your communications 
respecting the Servants no mention has been made of 
John's wife. What do you understand to be her plan? 
Enclosed is a letter from him to her, or some friend 
I suppose of hers and another from James to his 
deltoboso. 

If I have not already advised you of it, it is necessary 
now to do so, that Mrs. Stuart has paid for the tickets 
you purchased for her and Mrs. Alexander that was. 

When you can get at the last letter or letters of the 
Count de Estaing to me, I wish you would send me a 
transcript of what he says, or whether any thing of 
a Bust he has sent me, of Mr. Necker, together with a 
number of Prints of that Gentleman and the Marquis 
de la Fayette, which are come to my hands in a pack- 
age from Baltimore.

Dear Sir, 

Your letters of the 26th. & 3oth-of the last & 3d. of 
the present month have come duly to hand. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 17 

Without entering into the details, I can assure you 
that I am perfectly satisfied with the steps you have 
taken respecting the vessel which is to bring the furni- 
ture and servants to Philadelphia with your agree- 
ment with Mr. Macomb & whatever you shall do with 
the houses I was compelled to build on his Lots with 
your conduct towards and agreement with Mr. and 
Mrs. Hyde and with your taking the carpeting from 
Barry and Rogers, although it arrived much after the 
time it ought, by agreement, to have been delivered. 
As Mr. Macomb will, more than probable, get the houses 
for little or nothing, you acted very properly, I think, 
in taking down the closets, partitions and fixtures, 
which I purchased of the French Minister, and which 
would have been equally convenient to him, rather 
than increase his gains at my loss. If the vessel can 
bring them, they can unquestionably be made useful 
in our intended habitation if not, they will probably 
fetch something. 

The easy and quiet temper of Fanny is little fitted I 
find for the care of my niece Harriot Washington who 
is grown almost, if not quite a woman, & what to do 
with her at the advanced size she is arrived at, I am 
really at a loss. Her age (just turned of 14) is not too 
great for a boarding school, but to enter now with any 
tolerable prospect, the Mistress of it must not only be 
respectable, but one who establishes and will enforce 
good rules. She is prone to idleness, and having been 
under no controul, would create all the difficulty . I have 
formed no resolution respecting what will be proper 
for me to do with her, but that I may the better judge, 
I request that you will enquire whether there be a prop- 
er School (for her to board at) in Philadelphia* If so, 
whether there are at it genteel girls of her size & age 
who the mistress of it is, what her character terms, 
&ca, are the numbers of it who of the principal fami- 



i8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

lies, and how they are entertained and accommodated? 
I have not intimated any thing of this matter to Har- 
riot yet, who if it should be, would I dare say be a good 
deal alarmed, as she had I dare say rather mix with 
other company than be in a boarding school. Among 
other things enquire what is taught at these schools. 
I must further desire, that in pursuing your enquiries 
after a School for Washington, particularly if one is to 
be found in the College at Philadelphia fit for him, that 
you would extend them to the reputation of the higher 
branches in that Seminary, & whether much good could 
be expected from my fixing my Nephews George & 
Lawrence in it. From what I can find, they are doing 
but little in Alexandria, having left the study of the 
languages, & indeed Mr. McWhir, & are learning French 
& the Mathematics under a Mr. Harron. George & 
indeed Lawrence, I am told, are well disposed youths, 
neither of them wanting capacity; and both, es- 
pecially the first, very desirous of improvement. I 
would wish to know what their studies and board would 
stand them annually in a word, the best estimate 
(exclusive of clothes) of the expense of fixing them at 
that place. 

As I have had no account yet of what has been done, 
or is doing to our new habitation, or what ideas to an- 
nex to Mr. Morris's information to you that the House 
would not be ready for your reception before the ioth. 
of the present month, I should be glad to receive a full 
statement of these matters as soon as you arrive at 
Philadelphia & have time to look into things* 

We all join in best wishes for you & Mrs. Lear and 
for your and the safe arrival of everything in 
Philadelphia. 

With sincere regard and affection 
I am Yrs.

MOUNT VERNON, Octr. 27th. 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

On Sunday last I returned from a twelve days ex- 
cursion up the Potomack, and found your letters of 
the 6th. & loth, from New York and i4th.& i7th. from 
Philadelphia. I am very glad to hear that you are all 
arrived at the latter place safe, and the furniture, as 
you conceive, in good order. It was very right to give 
John's wife the same privilege that was allowed to 
others, and Mr. and Mrs. Hyde's coming in the stage is 
equally agreeable to me. 

I have no particular directions to give respecting 
the appropriation of the furniture. By means of the 
Bow windows, the back rooms will become the largest, 
and of course will receive the furniture of the largest 
dining and drawing Rooms, and in that case, although 
there is no closet within the former, there are some in 
the Steward's room directly opposite, which are not 
inconvenient; or (but here I am speaking somewhat 
at random, not knowing to what use it has hitherto 
been applied) there is a small room adjoining the Kitch- 
en (by the Pump) that might, if it is not essential for 
other purposes, be appropriated for the Images, save 
china, and other things of this sort, which are not in 
common use. Mrs. Morris, who is a notable lady in 
family arrangements, can give you much information 
in all the conveniences about the house and buildings ; 
and I dare say would rather consider it as a Compli- 
ment to be consulted in these matters (as she is so near) 
than a trouble to give her opinion of them, or in put- 
ing up any of the fixtures, as the house is theirs, and 
will revert to them, with the advantages or disadvan- 
tages which will result from the present establishment 
of things t I am very glad you pressed them not to 



20 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

incommode themselves by an inconvenient remove 
we are very happy to hear of her recovery and request 
you to present our Compliments of congratulation to 
her & Mr. Morris on the occasion. 

I am very anxious to have the rent which I am to 
pay for my new residence ascertained before I take up 
my quarters in it you will perceive by the enclosed 
answer to a letter I wrote to Mr. Morris on the subject 
that this point is yet unsettled. Previous to my ap- 
plication to Mr. Morris, I was informed by the Com- 
mittee, with whom I had conversed on the subject, 
that it was well understood I was to pay rent. I 
have therefore to request that you will get the 
matter fixed in some way or other with them. 
A just value I am willing to pay more I have 
no idea will be asked, but my fears rather are that they 
want to make it the expence of some public body 
(which I shall not consent to) and that they do not 
care to avow it. 

If the servants can be conveniently accommodated 
without using the Stable loft, it will certainly be much 
the best & safest ; for I am certain no orders given to 
my people wd. restrain them from carrying lights if 
they were to be in it as lodgers. 

I send you a letter with the Bill of loading for wines 
shipped by Fenwick Mason &a, which if arrived you 
will give the necessary orders about. By return of the 
person who carries this and other letters to the Post 
office in Alexandria, I expect to receive accounts of 
later date than the iyth. from you, and possibly some- 
thing more indicative of Peace or War between Spain 
& England which has hung long in suspence. 

Our best wishes attend you and Mrs. Lear, and 
I am Dear Sir 

Your affectionate friend 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 21 

No. 9. 

MOUNT VERNON, Octr. 3ist. 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

I have reed, your letter of the 24th. since the date 
of my last to you, and am very glad to hear that the 
most valuable parts of the furniture have borne their 
transportation without receiving damage, and that 
your expectation of equal success respecting the re- 
mainder is sanguine. I am pained, however, to find 
there is a doubt that the house will not be completely 
finished and ready for our reception towards the latter 
end of next month. At all times this would be at- 
tended with inconvenience, but at that season and 
while Congress are in session, it would be exceeding so. 
As the Pagoda can be put up in half an hour, at any 
time, it may (if not already disposed of) remain un- 
fixed, until we arrive, and that I may be in Philadel- 
phia in time, it is my present intention to leave this 
place on Monday, the 22d. of next month. I could not 
clearly understand Colo. Van Home when I applied to 
him (as I came through Baltimore) for a proper and 
convenient Stage Coach for part of the family to return 
in. He said he could provide and would provide and so 
on, but although he wanted to convey the idea of a cer- 
tain reliance on him it did not appear clear to me, that 
I could rely on him for more than the common Stage 
Coach or Waggon ; this being the case, and the Driver 
who brought us hither being desirous of coming for us 
again, adding that he could always get a freight to 
Alexandria, induces me to request that you would, as 
his was a large and roomy close coach, his horses good 
& himself a careful driver, make enquiry (without en- 
tering into an engagement with the proprietor) wheth- 
er the same Coach, horses & man could be had, and 
whether he would positively engage to be here on the 



22 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

2oth. or 2ist. of Novr. if after hearing from you, I 
should request it. The terms on which he would come 
must be explicity defined, that I may, without delay, 
return a precise answer. You will readily perceive 
that I do not mean to place my sole dependence upon 
this Stage. No : I shall by this conveyance also write 
to Colo. Van Home to know what absolute dependence 
may be placed on him. Thus having two Strings to 
my bow I may chuse the one which promises best. 
You will readily perceive also that there is no time to 
spare in my hearing from you you from me and for 
the Coach to be here in time. Colo. Biddle can point 
you to the man, who ought to know that his terms 
should be moderate, because Colo. Van Home's (as 
Horses will go from Stage to Stage only) must be lower 
than the last Trip cost me. 

I should conceive that a wreath round the crests 
that will be on the pannels of the Coach would be more 
correspondent with the Seasons which will remain 
thereon, than the motto. And that the motto on such 
of the Plates as require it, upon the Harness, would be 
best; but as this is mere matter of opinion, unac- 
companied with a view of the work, I am so far from 
being tenacious of it, that I shall leave it to you and 
him (Clarke) to adopt which of the two shall appear 
best, when the whole is taken into one view. What 
appearance does the Coach assume at present? and 
how will it look when finished? 

Are Mrs. Brodeau's terms, such as do actually exist, 
or does she mean to avail herself of the occasion to com- 
mence a new era in them ? They (especially the Board) 
appear to be high. Pray without giving any expec- 
tation of Harriot to either, for I have decided nothing 
respecting her, know what are Mrs. Pine's terms. 
Mrs. Brodeau was I understand once of Mr. Morris's 
family; this may occasion a predilection in that quar- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 23 

ter. Mrs. Pine's standing in that way not being long, 
little may be said of her on that account, but she may 
be equally capable & possibly more respectable than 
the other. 

Let me know what answer was given to, or notice 
taken of, the Extract you have sent me, from the letter 
of Count de Estaing when he was written to on the sub- 
ject. I fear I might not have been sufficiently polite 
& thankful for his present, as the thing itself has en- 
tirely escaped me, & the box with the prints scarcely 
brought any recollection of the circumstance to my 
mind. 

I have heard nothing yet of Capt. Vance, but am 
glad you sent the sugar. By mistake a letter from 
James Tilghman, Esqr. respecting a legacy to Miss 
Anderson from Colo. Colvill, was enclosed to you in my 
last, which I desire may be returned in your next, 
after the receipt of this, as I shall want to answer, 
even if I cannot comply with it. 

As we shall have new connections to form with dif- 
ferent Tradesmen, find out those in each branch who 
stand highest for skill and fair dealing. 'Tis better to 
be slow in chusing than to be under the necessity of 
changing and that it may be done upon sure grounds, 
compare one acct. with another (for partialities, per-, 
haps less laudable motives, mix very much in all these 
things), and see where the preponderancy is. 

We all join in best wishes for you and Mrs. Lear & 
with affectionate regard I am

fore me, and the parts of them wch. require it shall be 
answered. 

If the Schools in the College are tinder good masters, 
and as fit for boys of Washington's standing as a private 
School, I am still of opinion (for the reasons mentioned 
in a former letter) that he had better be placed there in 
the first instance. The propriety however of this will 
depend, ist. upon the character & ability of the master, 
under whose tuition he will be 2d., upon the police 
& discipline of the School and sdly., upon the num- 
ber of boys, for I lay it down as a maxim, that if the 
number of the pupils is too great for the tutors, justice 
cannot be done, be the abilities of the latter what they 
will. What the due proportion beyond which it ought 
not to go, is in some measure matter of opinion, but an 
extreme must be obvious to all, and you will easily de- 
cide upon it, in your own mind, if nothing should be 
finally resolved upon by me previous to my arrival. 

Enclosed I send you a letter from Mr. Gouvr. Morris 
with the Bill of Cost of the articles he was to send me. 
The prices of the plated ware exceed f ar exceed the 
utmost bounds of my calculations; but as I am per- 
suaded he has done what he conceives right, I am sat- 
isfied and request you to make immediate payment to 
Mr. Constable if you can raise the means, the duties 
are also to be paid- You will see by the enclosed (left 
open for your perusal) that I have promised this. 
Ought not the sum remitted by Colo. Humphreys to 
Mr. Morris to be deducted? Make this without creat- 
ing any difficulty, the subject of arrangement with 
Mr. Constable. As these coolers are designed for warm 
weather, & will be, I presume, useless in cold, or in that 
which the liquors do not require cooling, quere, 
would not a stand like that for Castors, with four aper- 
tures for as many different kinds of liquors, just suffi- 
cient (each aperture) to hold one of the cut decanters 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 25 

sent by Mr. Morris, be more convenient for passing the 
bottles from one to another, than handing each bottle 
separately, by which it often happens that one bottle 
moves, another stops, & all are in confusion? Two of 
these, one for each end of the table, with a flat bottom, 
with or without feet (to prevent tilting), open at the 
sides but with a raised rim as Castors have and an up 
right, by way of handle in the middle, could not cost 
a great deal were they made wholy of Silver. Talk to 
a Silver Smith and know the cost and whether they 
could be immediately made if required in a handsome 
fashion. Perhaps the Coolers sent by Mr. Morris may 
afford Ideas of taste ; perhaps too (if they are not too 
heavy when examined) they may supercede the ne- 
cessity of such as I have described, by answering the 
purpose themselves. Four double flint glasses (such as 
I expect Mr . Morris has sent) will weigh I conj ecture four 
pounds ; the wine in them when full will be 8 Ibs. more. 
These added to the weight of the Coolers will, I fear, 
make these latter too unwieldy to pass, especially by 
ladies, which induced me to think of a frame in the 
form of Castors which, by being open at bottom, 
would save silver. 

I approve, at least till inconvenience or danger shall 
appear, of the large Table ornaments (images) remain- 
ing on the side boards, and of the Pagoda's standing 
in the smallest drawing Room, as you may have fixed 
it. Had I delivered any sentiment from here respect- 
ing the fixture, that is the apartment I should have 
named for it. Whether the green which you have, 
or a new yellow Curtain, should be appropriated to the 
Stair Case above the Hall, may depend upon your 
getting an exact match in colour &c. of the latter. 
For the sake of appearances one would not, in instances 
of this sort, regard a small additional expense. 

If the servants can be accommodated without the 



26 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

rooms, which were intended for them at the end of the 
Hall, the use you propose to put them to, is certainly 
a good one But what is to become of Fidas and James's 
Wives ? Is it not their wishes to have their wives (if they 
incline to act as house maids) with them? And will 
not the contrary be a foundation for the loss of their 
husbands? 

I hope my Study (that is to be) will be in readiness 
against I arrive* And if the rubbish and other litter 
occasioned by the People of Mortar & the Carpenters 
is at a Stand, I wish that every thing of the sort may 
be removed, and the yard made and kept as clean as 
the Parlour* That was always the case in Mr. Morris's 
time, and has become more essential now as the best 
Rooms are now back, and an uninterrupted view from 
them into the yard and kitchen which is nearly upon a 
level with the dining Room. 

I am really sorry on public as well as private accounts 
to hear of Mr. Hare's loss. You would do well to 
lay in a pretty good stock of his, or some other Porter. 
As Mrs. Washington writes to Mrs. Lear, I shall add 
my best wishes to her only & affectionate regards to

Dear Sir, 

I am about to write you another short letter for to- 
morrow's post, although, in the course of the Mail, 
it cannot reach you before Tuesday night. The in- 
tention of it is, to inform you again that I depend upon 
Page's Coach, Horses and driver, for the removal 
of the children &ca., to Philadelphia, and that I shall 
not, unless I hear something to the contrary, from you, 
make any other provision for the journey. The reason 
for my again writing on this subject is that Giles who 
was sent from this on Wednesday, and directed if the 
stage had left Alexandria, to pursue it to George Town, 
and to have my letter to you deposited in the mail, in- 
stead of doing it gave the letter to one of the passengers 
a man he did not know one who had so comical a 
name that he does not recollect it, tho' told but who 
knew me knew you knew Major Jackson and who 
was so anxious to oblige that he all but demanded the 
letter from him. The case being thus and knowing 
how little dependence there is upon conveyances by 
private hands is the inducement of this second Epistle

MOUNT VBRNON, Novr. i4th. 1790. 

(Private) 

Dear Sir, 

Having wrote two letters to you on the subject of 
Page's stage coach (one or the other of which if not 
both, it is presumable will certainly have got to hand 
before this can) I shaE add no more thereto, than that 
the Coach of Page is now my dependence. 

I am, I must confess, exceedingly unwilling to go 
into a house without first knowing on what terms I do 
it, and wish that this sentiment could, in a delicate 
way, be again hinted to the parties concerned with me. 
I cannot, if there are no latent motives -which govern 
in the case, see any difficulty in the business. Mr. 
Morris has most assuredly formed an idea of what 
ought in equity to be the rent, of the tenement in 
the condition he left it ; and with this aid the Comee., 
I conceive, ought to be as little at a loss in determining 
on the terms it should rent for, with the additions and 
alterations which are about to be made, presumably 
in a plain and neat manner, not by any means in an 
extravagant style; because the latter is not only con- 
trary to my wishes, but would, in reality, be repug- 
nant to my interest and convenience; principally, 
because it would be the means of keeping me from the 
use and comforts of the house to a later day ; and be- 
cause the furniture & every thing else would require to 
be accordant therewith, besides its making me pay 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 29 

an extravagant price perhaps to suit the taste of others 
to comply with unreasonable charges of the work- 
men or to be taxed with the blended expences of the 
two houses (if they some times work at one and some 
times at the other). I do not know, nor do I believe 
that any thing unfair is intended by either Mr. Morris 
or the Committee; but let us for a moment suppose 
that the Rooms (the new ones I mean) should be hung 
with tapestry or a very rich & costly paper (neither 
of wch- would suit my present furniture that costly 
ornaments for the bow windows extravagant chim- 
ney pieces, &c. &c. were to be provided that work- 
men were to charge a pound for that which ought not 
to cost ten Shillings; and that advantage would be 
taken of the occasion to new paint every part of the 
house buildings &c., would there be any propriety in 
adding ten or 12^ P Cent for all these to the Rent of 
the House in its original state, for the two years that 
I am to hold it? If the solution of these questions are 
in the negative, wherein lyes the difficulty of determin- 
ing that the Houses and lots, when completed agree- 
ably to the plan proposed, ought to Rent for so much? 
After all is done that can be done the residence will not 
be so commodious as the house I left in New York (with 
the buildings I added) for there (and the want of it at 
Mr Morris's will found a serious inconvenience) my 
office was in a front Room below, where persons on 
business immediately entered; whereas in the present 
case they will have to ascend two pair of Stairs, and to 
pass by the public rooms, as well as private Chambers, 
to get to it ; notwithstanding which I am willing to 
allow as much as was paid by Mr. Macomb, & shall say 
nothing if more is demanded unless there is apparent 
extortion; and that the policy of delay is to see to 
what height Rents will tun before mine is fixed. In 
either of these cases I should not be pleased; and to

occupy the premises at the expen ce of any public body 
I will not. There is one expression in your letter of the

viz. ''The additions repairs &c. of the house in 
4 * which Mr* Morris now lives are likewise to be com- 
"prehended in the expenditures, to be refunded by the 
* 'rent in this house, " Is it meant by this that the rent 
of the House I am to go into is to be increased by the 
expenditures on the one Mr. Morris has removed to, 
or, that the rent of the first is to be considered as se- 
curity only for payment of the latter? If this is all I 
have naught to say against it, but dire necessity only 
would induce me to submit to the other. We all unite 
in best wishes for you & Mrs. Lear and

MOUNT VERNON, Novr. iyth. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

I am just setting off for Alexandria bad as the day 
is to a dinner given by the Citizens of that place to 
me ; and hope by the mail of this evening to be placed 
upon some certainty with respect to Page's Stage 
Coach, and that my Journey to Philadelphia may, as 
was intended, commence on Monday next the 226.. 

Upon examining the Caps of Giles and Paris I find 
they (especially Paris 's) are much worn, and wiV be un- 
fit to appear in with decency, after the journey from 
hence is performed, I therefore request that you will 
have two handsome ones made, with fuller and richer 
tassels at top than the old ones have. That the maker 
of them may have some government in the size the en- 
closed dimentions of their heads, will I presume be 
sufficient. As the addition of a pair of leading Harness 
to the Coach will riot greatly enhance the aggregate cost 
I wish, in order that the whole may be of a piece, that

ers (with a Postillion Saddle, the Saddle cloth of which 
to be the same as the Hammel Cloth with the same

MOUNT VERNON, Novr. 22nd. 1790. 
Dear Sir, 

The day is come, and the hour at hand, or very 
nearly when our journey will Commence for Phila- 
delphia. From the Stage drivers account, the Roads 
in places, especially between George Town and Balti- 
more, are almost unpassible. This circumstance, and 
the desire of not injuring my horses, will make my 
movements very slow, and they may be precarious 
as Giles is very unwell, and my bungling Smith, has 
lamed one of the Horses that draw the Waggon in 
shoeing him. 

I think Mr. Page judged very wisely in not sending

SPURRIER'S, Novr. 23d. 1790. 

Dear Sir, 

With some difficulty (from the most infamous Roads 
that ever were seen) we have got to this place, and are 
waiting dinner; but have no expectation of reaching 
Baltimore to night. 

Dunn has given such proofs of his want of skill in 
driving that I find myself under a necessity of looking 
out for another Coachman. Before we got to Eliza- 
beth Town we were obliged to take him from the Coach 
and put him to the Waggon. This he turned over 
twice; and this morning was found much intoxicated. 
He has also got the horses into a habit of stoping. 

Mrs. Washington's predilection for Jacob is as strong 
as my prejudice and fears are great. Yet in your en- 
quiries after a Coachman, ask something concerning 
Jacob. He wanted much it seems to return to us 
whilst we were in Philadelphia. 

The stage is this instant starting & I can only add 
that I am Yrs.

Dear Sir, 

My attention was so much occupied the days pre- 
ceeding my departure from Philadelphia, with matters 
of a public nature, that I could scarcely think of those 
which more immediately related to my own. 

Who the Steward and house keeper shall be, must 
be left to Mrs* Washington and yourself to determine 
from circumstances, & the offers that are made. Fran- 
cis, unless Holker's man could be unexceptionably 
obtained, I should prefer for reasons I have already 
mentioned to you; but be him or tihem whom they 
may, it must be expressly understood, that wine is not 
admissable at their Table. If it is so under any pre- 
tence whatever, it will terminate as the permission 
given Hyde has done. It would be well in all other 
respects to have a clear definition of the expectations 
and obligations of the Parties, that mistakes may not 
happen. If Frauncis should be employed, it ought to 
be made known to him that his services in the kitchen 
as usual, will be expected, & that in case of the present 
Cook's leaving me, or attempting to raise his wages; 
that he is to do with Hercules & such under aids as 
shall be found indispensably necessary, nay, further, 
that if upon trial he finds, as I am sure is the case, that 
we can do without Vicars, he may be discharged. How 
far, under present circumstances, the dutch Girl in the 
Kitchen, is necessary, you must Judge of, and act ac- 
cordingly. As Jacob's wife is brought into the family, 
the new Landry women will go out of Course. 

I wish you would have all the packages moved out 
of the Garden and have it kept in complete order, at my 
eocpence and the paved yard, also : Rhemer and Jacob 
are certainly competent to this business. The top of

Dear Sir, 

Late this afternoon your letters of the 23d. & 24th. 
instant came to hand, and as the Mail is about to be 
closed (leaving this before Sun-rise in the morning) I 
shall, as I must, be short. 

I return some letters to be filed: one from Colo- 
Blaine to be given to Genl. Knox, to be acted upon as 
he pleases ; he is as well acquainted with the man as 
I am, and knows the want of such a character better 
than I do; another letter from Colo. Cannon which I 
may venture to say proves him to be, what I will not 
call him, and that I need never look for any Rent from 
him. I pray you to say to him, if he does come to Phil- 
adelphia during my absence that his own statement 
given at New York does not justify his prest. report 
and that I am too well acquainted with the prices of 
grain & the demand for it last year in his own neigh- 
bourhood, to be imposed upon by such a tale as his let- 
ter exhibits. In a word that I am by no means satis- 
fied with his treatment of me; for sure I am I shall 
get nothing from him.but assurances of improvements,

Whether a certain Gentleman is the man I con- 
ceived him to be, or such a one as is hinted at in the 
letter you enclosed me, is not yet certain, but admit- 
ting the latter it is too late to look "back. I cannot be 
in a less productive situation by the engagement than 
I was ; the principal disadvantage resulting from it will 
be, that I can never count upon the payments until 
they are actually made, consequently can never 
speculate upon the money which I wished to have 
done. If I recollect rightly there is something in Colo. 
Cannon's letter (transmitted to you) concerning the 
Kanh&wa Lands ; it it is indicative ot an intention to 
let them, or that he conceives himself empowered to do 
it I desire you will inform him of the sale ot them.

RICHMOND, April i2th. 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last to you from Mount Vernon, your let- 
ters of the 3d. and 5 th. Instant have been reed., the 
last at this place where I arrived yesterday to dinner . 

If the case is as you suspect, it is expedient and prop- 
er to remove Washington to a School in which he will 
make some progress in his learning ; and that it is so, 
I have had suspicions for some time, principally on ac- 
count of his fondness of going to the College. Boys of 
his age are better pleased with relaxed discipline and 
the inattention of their tutors, than with conduct that 
brings them forward. It would have been highly 
pleasing to me ( for the reasons, which I have often ex- 
pressed) to have continued Washington at the College, 
but, if after the enquiries you have made, it should ap- 
pear, that there is either incompetency in the masters 
from the number of boys in the School, or from other 
causes, I will not waste his time in compliment to that 
Seminary, but before you finally decide on this matter, 
it is my wish as Colo. Hamilton, GenL Knox and the 
Attorney-General have sons in the same predicament 
(if they are not removed) that you would consult and 
act in Concert with them; & I shall be satisfied in 
whatever is done in consequence of it. And should 
like to have him at the same School that Hamilton's 
son goes to. 

The Attorney-General's case and mine I conceive, 
from a conversation I had with him respecting our 
Slaves, is some what different. He in order to qualify 
himself for practice in the Courts of Pennsylvania, was 
obliged to take the Oaths of Citizenship to that State; 
whilst my residence is incidental as an Officer of Gov- 
ernment only, but whether among people who are in 



38 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

the practice of enticing slaves even where there is no 
colour of law for it, this distinction will avail, I know not, 
and therefore beg you will take the best advise you can 
on the subject, and in case it shall be found that any 
of my Slaves may, or any for them shall attempt their 
freedom at the expiration of six months, it is my wish 
and desire that you would send the whole, or such part 
of them as Mrs. Washington may not chuse to keep, 
home f or although I do not think they would be bene- 
fitted by the change, yet the idea of freedom might be 
too great a temptation for them to resist. At any 
rate it might, if they conceived they had a 
right to it, make them insolent in a State of Slav- 
ery. As all except Hercules and Paris are dower 
negroes, it behoves me to prevent the emancipation of 
them, otherwise I shall not only loose the use of them, 
but may have them to pay for. If upon taking good 
advise it is found expedient to send them back to Vir- 
ginia, I wish to have it accomplished under pretext 
that may deceive both them and the Public; and 
none I think would so effectually do this, as Mrs. Wash- 
ington coming to Virginia next month (towards the 
middle or latter end of it, as she seemed to have a wish 
to do) if she can accomplish it by any convenient and 
agreeable means, with the assistance of the Stage 
Horses &c. This would naturally bring her maid and 
Austin and Hercules under the idea of coming home 
to Cook whilst we remained there, might be sent on in 
the Stage. Whether there is occasion for this or not 
according to the result of your enquiries, or issue the 
thing as it may, I request that these Sentiments and 
this advise may be known to none but yourself & Mrs* 
Washington. From the following expression in your 
letter " that those who were of age might follow the ex- 
"ample of his (the Attorney's people) after a residence 
"of six mouths " it would seem that none could apply

Not having heard from you since I wrote to you from

where we are, and to cover the enclosed for Mrs. Wash-

We have, all things considered, come on tolerably 
well, yet, some of the horses, especially the two last 
bought are not a little worsted by their journey, & 
the whole if brought back, will not cut Capers as they 
did at setting out. 

I came to this place yesterday and shall proceed on

my next halting place, from whence if the Post of this 
evening brings letters to me, they will be answered, for 
there will be no time to do it here, as not more than an

Dear Sir,

there I reed, your letters of the loth. & i$th. of April, 
but the continual hurry into which I was thrown by 



40 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

entertainments visits and ceremonies of one land 
or another, scarcely allowed me a moment that I coud 
call my own nor is the case much otherwise here. 

No letters, North of Virginia will now reach me until 
I arrive at Fredericksbtrrg in that State, which is the 
first place at which I shall strike the line of the Post. 
There are no cross Posts on this side Alexandria, and 
the chances of letters getting to me by private hands, 
as my rout back will be very wide of the Post Road, is 
so unfavorable that I have ordered all letters to be 
stopped at Charleston and sent back to the Post Office 
in Fredericksburg to await my arrival there. 

The silence of Prauncis is evidence sufficient, that 
nothing is to be expected from him and if your prospects 
with the other person (mentioned in your letter) are 
no better, the plan suggested in your letter of the i4th. 
may be tried, as the best expedient that offers. A 
little experience (and there is time for it before the 
meeting of Congress) will prove the Utility or inutility 
of the Measure. 

I came to this place on Thursday afternoon and shall 
leave it to morrow, after attending the first church. 
The Roads are abominably sandy and heavy my 
Horses (especially the two I bought just before I left 
Philadelphia, and my old White Horse) are much worn 
down, and I have yet 150 or 200 miles of heavy sand 
to pass before I fairly get into the upper and firmer 
Roads.

Instant the day appointed by me at the last meeting, 
to meet the Commissioners at George Town, in order to 
fix on the Spot for the Public buildings, and for other 
purposes arising from the residence act. 

I have at this place reed, your letter of the 3oth. 
Ulto. but none of an intermediate date between that of 
the 1 5th. and it- Your directions to have them sent 
cross wise the Country, was unlucky first because 
there are no cross Posts. 2nd. because my rout back 
was not irrevocably fixed and 3d. because I had, 
knowing these circumstances, directed from Charleston 
all letters which might be following me, to be returned 
to this place to await my call. The slow movement 
of the mail in the three Southern States prevented (I 
presume) these directions getting to Richmond before 
the letters were forwarded to Taylor's Ferry, and my 
crossing at Carter's (a ferry much higher up James 
River) has been the cause or causes, I imagine of 
missing them. 

Being interrupted by visittors I shall postpone until 
I arrive at Mount Vernon further communications, 
the principal, indeed the only purpose of this letter 
being to advise you of my arrival at this place, and of 
my intended stay at Mount Vernon for the reasons

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 2 9th. Ulto. I acknowledged the 



42 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

receipt of from Fredericksburg, since which another of 
the 5th. Inst. has been received. 

The Commissions for Whitaker and Me. Dowell, were 
properly issued, as those also are mentioned in your 
letter of the 5th. and it was on my mind, that blank 
commissions signed by me were left with you, for the 
officers of the Revenue cutters. This not being the case, 
quere if there is not a necessity of sending some to me 
for my signature, as I shall not leave this before the 
2 7th., may be detained at George Town two or three days, 
and must afterwards proceed slowly, on account of the 
low condition of my horses. The Secretary of the 
Treasury will be able to decide on this point, and I wish 
you to act in the matter accordingly as he shall advise 
you. I find another of the federal Judges (Hopkinson}, 
has by his death occasioned a vacancy in the District 
of Pennsylvania. As some have and others will un- 
questionably apply for the appointment, I wish you 
would use every indirect means in your power to ascer- 
tain the public opinion, with respect to the fittest char- 
acter as a successor to Hopkinson. Pursue the same 
mode to learn who it is thought would fill the present 
Auditor's office (as he will be appointed Comptroller) 
with the greatest ability and integrity. Several have 
been brought to my view for the Comptroller's place 
(who I suppose would accept of the Auditor's) as able 
& meritorious Characters; among these are the names 
of Mr .Richmond, the present Comptroller or Auditor of 
Maryland, Colo. Pickering Mr. Kean Colo. Dray- 
ton, a Gentleman of So. Carolina, Colo. Forest & 
others. 

It is hardly to be expected by the Trustees of any 
College that complaints will not be made by the parents 
or friends of the boys who go to it, if they conceive they 
are neglected ; and if Trustees mean to do their duty, 
& Support the Reputation of the Seminary, they ought

I am sure to be thankful, for well f ounded Representa- 
tions of neglect in the economy police or inattention 
of the professors & teachers. 

I am glad to hear that the affairs of our own family 
are going on well and it might not be improper to 
hint to the Servants who are with you, (before they are 
joined by those with me) that it will be very idle & fool- 
ish in them to enter into any combination for the pur- 
pose of supplanting those who are now in authority; 
for the attempt in the first place will be futile & must 
recoil upon themselves; and because admitting they 
were to make the lives of the present Steward & house- 
keeper, so uneasy as to induce them to quit, others 
would be got to supply their places ; and such too, as 
would be equally, if not more rigid in the exaction of 
the duties required of servants- In a word, that these 
Characters are indispensibly necessary to take trouble 
off the hands of Mrs* Washington and myself & will be 
supported ; any attempts therefore to Counteract them 
in the line of their duty, whilst they act agreeably to 
established rules, and their conduct is marked with 
propriety, will be considered as the strongest evidence 
they can give of their own unworthiness, & dispositions 
to be lazy, if not dishonest. A good & faithful Servant 
is never aff raid or unwilling to have his conduct looked 
into, but the reverse, because the more it is inspected 
the brighter it shines. With respect to the other mat- 
ters of a domestic nature mentioned in your letter of 
the 5th. I shall postpone touching upon them until I 
see you. We are suffering in these parts by a severe 
drought. Grass is scarcely worth cutting and Oats 
if rain keeps off two or three days longer must be ruined. 
Corn is bad, but it is too early in the year, to form an 
opinion of the yield of it. Remember me to Mrs. Lear,

MOUNT VERNON, Juneipth. 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last to you (from this place) I have reed, 
yottr letters of the isth. immediately from Philadel- 
phia, and those of the lyth. and 24th. of April, after 
their having taken a trip to the Southward. 

I find by Mrs. Washington's letters that Mr. Praun- 
cis is very desirous of introducing Mrs. Read, into 
the family again ; this idea it would be well for him to 
relinquish at once and forever ; for unless there are rea- 
sons inducing it, which my imagination cannot furnish, 
it never will happen. Hercules can ansr. every pur- 
pose that Mrs. Read would do, and others which she 
will not, and sure I am that the difference in the ex- 
pence between the two will bear no comparison; 
besides supposing Mrs. Read to act fairly & honestly 
(which by the by I do not suppose she is disposed to do 
if she is not to be the absolute mistress of her own con- 
duct in a word uncontrollable she would not remain 
in the family a month. She would also encrease the 
number, and of course, the expence of the second 
Table, which under the administration of Mr. Hyde, 
I believe was equal to the first (public days excepted). 
But I hope it is a matter clearly understood by Mr. 
Frauncis that wine is not to be used at it again, under 
any pretence whatsoever, for there can be no line drawn 
if it be once admitted, either as to the quantity or 
quality, that will be drank at it. 

By the last Post the letter of Messrs. Fenwick & 
Mason, explanatory of the Wine from Charleston, was 
forwarded to you and I should be glad to hear that the 
wine was reed, in good order ; for no attempts of that 
house hitherto, seem to have succeded well so far as I 
am concerned in them. The other Wine to Mr. Jef- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 45 

ferson will I presume be divided, and settled for as soon 
as he shall have returned from his Northern Tour. 

Without going into the detail on the several points of 
your letters I can assure you, that the measures, that 
you have adopted with respect to Washington George 
and Lawrence my black people & the employment 
of Mr. Frauncis & Mr. Emmerson as far as they have 
been communicated, meet my entire approbation, 
and I wish you to inculcate strongly upon the white 
servants of the family (as mentioned in my last) that 
it will be vain and idle in them to suppose, that by a 
combination they will avoid their own duties or can 
effect the discharge of those, to whom the management 
of the household business is committed. They must be 
sensible that they have as high wages as are given to 
any servants in their respective stations, that they 
are as well provided & perhaps, better paid than most 
and no extra duties imposed upon them; consequently 
that if an attempt of this sort is made it will recoil upon 
themselves. I shall communicate the same sentiments 
to those who are with me that if they do sin it shall be 
with their eyes open, and tinder a knowledge of the 
Consequences. 

As I shall have occasion for a number of Blankets 
for my people this fall; and as the best time to pur- 
chase them I am told is after the Winter's demand is 
over, I should be glad if you would make a pretty dili- 
gent enquiry after them, before I arrive; that I may 
know whether and upon what terms I can get supplied. 
It is probable I may want near two hundred. 

The Major desires me to write for half a bushel of 
Turnip seed of the best kind viz. a peck of the white 
Summer and other peck of the red Winter ; but a good 
Winter and a good Summer Turnip of any other kind, 
I suppose, will do. It must be sent soon or both will 
be useless. 



46 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

I should like to see Mr. Payne's answer to Mr. 
Burke's Pamphlet ; if it is to be had and could be sent 
off by the Post on Friday it would meet me at George 
Town on Monday the 27th, where I shall be & from 
whence I shall proceed ; but on what day is more than 
I am able to determine until I go there, and shall see 
what is necessary to be done at that place, towards 
carrying the law respecting the permanent residence 
into effect. To do this there are many matters to de- 
cide upon; and some of them not a little difficult. It 
is not very probable therefore that I shall leave George 
Town before Thursday, but I would not have such de- 
pendence placed on this, as to expect letters will meet 
me there on Wednesday evening, especially as it is in 
distant contemplation (if upon enquiry at George Town 
it shall be found that the difference in the length of the 
two roads is not great) to return by the way of 
Frederick Town, York & Lancaster, to Philadelphia. 

Paris has become so lazy, self willed, and impudent 
that John (the Coachman) has no sort of Government 
of him; on the contrary, John says it was a maxim 
with Paris, to do nothing he was ordered, and every 
thing he was forbid. This conduct, added to the in- 
capacity of Giles for a Postillion, who I believe will 
never be able to mount a horse again for that purpose 
has induced me to find Paris some other employment 
than in the Stables. Of course, I shall leave him at 
home, A boy or two may be necessary there to 
assist about the horses, Carriages & Harness but 
these (dutch ones) it is possible may be had for their 
victuals & clothes, especially if there are large im- 
portations from Germany (as some articles in the 
papers say there will be). I mention the matter now 
that in case arrivals should happen before I get back, 
of these kind of people, you may be apprised of my 
wishes : low & squat (well made) boys would suit best.

If emigrants are not to be had, there can be no doubt

This is the eve of my departure for George Town, and

it is not so with me either from Company or business, 
the latter occasioned by a constant succession of Com- 
pany during the whole of last week: wch. obliged 
me to postpone many matters until this day, which 
ought, and but for that reason, would have been done 
in the course of it. Such time as I have been able to

ing of the letters & papers which have been received

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the i8th. with the Gazettes came duly 
to hand, and I wish you to forward the latter (such as 
were sent last) by Wednesday's and Friday's Post; in 
which case they will arrive in Alexandria, on Mondays 
and Fridays when I shall have a messenger at the Post- 
Ofl5.ce in readiness to receive them. Accompany the 
papers with occurrencies worthy of communication, if 
any there be uncontained in them. 

Let Mr. Page know that it shall depend upon his 
carriage's being at George Town by Noon, on Tuesday 
the 1 8th. of Octr. that I may be able to proceed Phila- 
delphia-wards the same day. Mrs. Washington, the 
children and the servants, will be there in readiness for 
that purpose. 

Favored with fine weather we had a pleasant Jour- 
ney home, and arrived safe on Tuesday last. Mrs Stu-

best wishes to you Mrs- Lear& Major Jackson.

MOUNT VERNON, Septr. 26th. 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last to you I have reed, your two letters of 
the 2 ist. Inst. one dated in the morning, and the other 
in the evening of that day. 

What appeared to you to be the object of the formal 
enquiries of Mr. Powell and the Mayor of the City in 
their late interrogations? Did they mean to convict Mr. 
Gallatine of mis-representation or me of an improper 
interference in the building of a House for the Presi- 
dent of the United States? If the first Mr. Gallatine may 
speak for himself; if the latter I have no scruple in 
declaring to those Gentlemen or to any others, that no 
one has a right to publish sentiments as mine that were 
never uttered, or conceived by me; especially too after 
the reverse had been explicitly declared to Mr. Fisher, 
at his own request which was made as he professed to 
answer a particular purpose. Previous to the above 
communication to Mr. Fisher, I do not recollect that I 
ever expressed a sentiment respecting the Public build- 
ing. To a Pennsylvanian or one wishing to promote the 
measure, I am certain I never did; but afterwards 
when I found my want of recommendation & conse- 
quent dissatisfaction, was adduced as argument to sup- 
port the measure, I was inclined that the following 
truth should be known, first that I never had, since I 



S o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

got rid of the workmen expressed my dissatisfaction 
with my accomodations. Secondly, that as I have 
already made two expensive removals, and had not 
long to remain in Office, I would not make a third, un- 
less I was compelled to do it. And thirdly, under 
these circumstances, and a thorough conviction that 
the proposed building might be delayed and still erect- 
ed in time for my successor. It was candid and fair to 
make these sentiments, known especially as they were 
accompanied with a pointed declaration that it was 
only as the building regarded myself personally that 
they were communicated, having no desire to inter- 
meddle in the politics of the State. 

I am glad you stated the matter in writing to Mr. 
Powell, Sentiments and communications expressed 
in that manner, cannot be misconceived, or misrep- 
resented, from the want of recollection. I hope there 
is no intention of adding near 50 Pr. Cent to the rent 
of the house I occupy ; for I well remember my desiring 
you to inform the Committee that I must and would 
know upon what terms I was to Inhabit the House and 
yt. you told me they had fixed the Rent at $ao Pr. 
Annum. 

If you have not already made a purchase of Blankets, 
I wish you to suspend doing it untill you hear from me 
again. I am about to send this day to Alexandria, 
where it is said large importations of this article have 
been made, to learn the qualities & price of the dutch 
Blanketing. Sitgreaves' memo, is not explicit enough 
to enable me to judge of the size or quality of his the 
onJy sort of them which are applicable to my use, are 
inserted thus, ''Striped Duff ells us/, to i8o/. Pr. 
"Piece of 15 Blankets. " This brings the lowest of 
these to 9/& the highest to i2/. each-^-which is high, 
supposing them of the largest size, & of the first quality. 
If you will mention in your next the length & breadth 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 51 

of the different sizes & whether they are of the best 
quality, I shall be better able to decide. 

I do not recollect whether I mentioned to you in my 
last, that the Major got home a day or two before us. 
He is much better than he was, but not yet free from 
the pain in his breast & Cough. 

Mrs. Washington and all the family (which at present 
is pretty numerous) join me in best wishes for yourself 
Mrs. Lear, Majr. Jackson & the child. 
I am, Dear Sir 

Your sincere friend &

Dear Sir, 

' Since my last to you which I think was written on 
this day week, I have reed, your letters of the 25th. & 
27th. Ulto. 

I am not yet able to speak decisively with respect 
to the Blankets. Many have arrived, but not yet 
opened in Alexandria. Mr. Wilson who has imported 
ot them largely, at from $6/.to 757. Sterlg Pr Piece of 
15 Blankets, has offered them to me at 70 P. Ct. but as 
he cannot before they are opened, give the size, or 
quality, it is impossible to say whether they will come 
cheap or dear. I shall ascertain this matter before 
Friday next, and will then write to you on the subject 
again. 

Letters and Papers from you by the Posts on Wed- 
nesdays & Fridays will come to me as soon those which 
may be forwarded on Mondays, as I do not send to the 
office on Wednesdays, which is the day the mail arrives 
there that leaves Philadelphia on Monday. Those 



S 2 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

which leave that place on Wednesday come in on Friday, 
& the Friday's mail arrives on Monday and these are 
the days I shall send up for letters &c. 

I send two French letters to be translated, and 
forwarded to me* 

It is a little singular when considered on the score 
of candor, that Mr. P should suffer Mr. S to as- 
sert what he did in the S without contradicting him ; 
but the views and conduct of the City influence stands 
in need of no developement in my mind. Nor have I 
a much higher opinion of the candor of Mr. F . He 
is very welcome however, to the copy of the letter 
you wrote Mr. P and with which you furnished 
Mm, as I wish the sentiments therein expressed 
to be generally known, since the matter has been 
introduced into the Legislature of the State, and 
so unfairly stated as it appears to have been done 
by both parties. The details you have given me 
of this matter was very proper, and I am glad 
you furnished me with them. It is quite right that I 
should be made acquainted with these things. 

I am very well satisfied with the determinations of 
the Comee. respecting the Rent, and the time of its com- 
mencing, and am glad of your expression to that effect.. 

How does the engraving of the Federal City advance? 
Send me some of the first that are struck off and let the 
others be disposed of as was agreed on. If you should 
learn with certainty that the Minister of France is 
coming to this place advise me of it, and when he sets 
out. 

All the family here are well except the Majr. who 
seems to be in, a poor way, and join me in best wishes 
for you & yours & for Majr. Jackson. I am sincerely 
and affectionately 

Yrs.

MOUNT VERNON, Octr. 7th. 1791. 

Dear Sir, 

Yottr letter of the soth. Ulto. came duly to hand with 
the enclosures- 

I have had samples of the Alexandria Blankets sent 
me the quality of them is not good, inferior to those 
I had from Watson, & far very far indeed inferior to 
those I used to import myself. The prices, length, & 
breadth of three kinds are enclosed. 

Messrs. Sitgreaves' give no length to their Blankets 
and if Colo. Biddle has been accurate in his accounts, 
& I understand him, the Blankets he has had offered to 
him, however good in other respects, are intolerably 
narrow. Under this view of the matter I am perplexed. 
I by no means like the prices or quality of those Blan- 
kets in Alexandria, and scarcely know what judgment 
to form of those in Philadelphia, but if whilst hesita- 
ting between the two I should miss both, it would be bad 
indeed, as my people would in that case be in great dis- 
tress the ensuing Winter. Upon the whole I have re- 
solved to refer the matter once more to you with the 
Alexandria prices & sizes (the quality you can only form 
an opinion of from the description I have already given) 
of the Blankets in that place, and to request that you 
& Colo* Biddle will endeavour to procure me the quan- 
tity wanting viz 200 ; if upon comparison you shall 
conceive I may be benefitted thereby. One hundred 
of the largest size &best quality is required ; the other 
hundred may be of the middle size but good in quality. 
But in truth if I am to form an opinion of the sizes by 
the accts. sent, the largest of them scarcely comes up 
to my ideas of a middle sized Blanket. At all events 
iet me know by the Wednesday's Post after you re- 



54 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

ceive this (and which will reach me only the day before 
I leave home) what I have to trust to, as I should re- 
gret a disappointment exceedingly. 

I recollect asking you if among my Pamphlets you 
had seen the journal of my tour to the French on La- 
beauf in the Year 1753? I understood you no ; but Mrs. 
Washington thinks you said yes- I have searched in 
vain for it here. Pray decide this point between us. 

As I shall have but little time between my return to 
Philadelphia and the meeting of Congress,, to arrange 
matters for the Communications I shall have to make 
at the opening of the Sessions I desire that you will 
(for my time is so much occupied here by Company & 
the necessary attention to my domestic concerns, as 
not to allow me time to do it) examine my speeches at 
the opening of the three last Sessions of Congress and 
compare the several matters recommended in them 
with the Laws that have passed, noting the things rec- 
ommended and not acted upon at all as also the mea- 
sures recommended and taken up by Congress but not 
finished; such as the Militia Law &ca. that I may, by 
seeing the state of the business, decide on the pro- 
priety (as I am about to meet a new House of Repre- 
sentatives) of bringing the same matters before Con- 
gress again. It will do if this enquiry is completed 
against my arrival, and I pray you to be correct in 
it. The Journals, or Mr. Beckley can inform you of 
these cases which have been taken up, but never fin- 
ished; & I wish you to ask at the Secretary of State's 
office what has been the result of the enquries which 
have issued from thence, in consequence of the resolve 
of Congress, to ascertain the quantity & state of the 
Lands ceded by No. Carolina.

sired if you make the purchase in Philadelphia to for- 
ward them by the first vessel which is bound to Alexan-

at the same time at the information, that the 24th. 
Inst. is the day feed on for the meeting of Congress. 
I had no more Idea of this than I had of its being dooms 
day. Supposing the 3ist. to be the day, I meant to 
have spent Monday and possibly Tuesday at George 
Town, & then to have proceeded leisurely on ; but as 
the case is I shall endeavour to reach Bladensburg at 
least the first night (that is Monday) and delay no time 
on the Road afterwards that can be avoided, as I shall 
have scarce any time to prepare my Communications 
for the openg. of the Session on the 24th. if there 
should be punctuality in the Members. 

This unexpected event makes it more essentially 
necessary, to look without delay and with accuracy 
into the Speeches & Laws (at the past Sessions) agree- 
ably to my former directions, that among other mat- 
ters they may be considered of when I arrive. If any 
thing else should have occurred to you, fit for recom- 
mendation or communication in the Speech, note it, 
that in case it should not^be among my memorandams 
it may be ready for consideration. 

There is a mystery attending the engravg. of the 
Federal City which I do not comprehend. It appears 
some-what singular that the incorrectness of the plan 
should not have been discovered till now, when Major 
L'Enfant was detained many days in Philadelphia to 
prepare & fit it for the purpose. 

If the memorial of Messrs. Friol Roux & Co. has 
not already been sent it may await my arrival in Phil- 
adelphia, as I shall have no leisure to give it a consid- 
eration, until after my communications have been pre- 
pared for Congress. Being much hurried I have only

MOUNT VERNON, July3oth. 1792, 
Dear Sir, 

Yottr letter from New York came duly to hand, and 
I was glad to find you had got that far in safety. I 
wish the remainder of your journey may prove equally 
pleasant & prosperous. My journey was not of this 
sort, for after I had parted with the Coach Horses I was 
plagued with those that succeeded them, the following 
day; and the sick mare by a dose of Physic which had 
been administered the night I reached Chester, was so 
weakened, and failed so much that she was unable to 
carry Austin any farther than Susquehanna, from 
thence she was led to Hartford and left, and two days 
afterwards gave up the ghost. 

I found the face of the Country here and on the 
road this side of Baltimore, much very much indeed 
parched by a severe drought and the corn in miserable 
plight; but the day & night we reached home, there 
fell a most delightful & refreshing rain, and the weather 
since has been as seasonable as the most sanguine 
farmer could wish, and if continued to us may make our 
Indian Corn crop midling great it is hardly possible 
*to be so much was it in arrears when the rains set in. 

Great complaints were heard of the Hessian fly, and 
of the rust or mildew, as I traveled on, and in some 
places I believe the damage has been great, but I con- 
ceive more is said than ought to be on this subject; 
and that the Crop, upon the whole, will be abundant of 
Wheat: mine in quantity (and the quality is good) 
will I expect greatly exceed any I have made these 
several Years past. 

I found at George Town many well conceived, & 
ingenious plans for the Public buildings in the New 
City: It was a pleasure indeed to find in an infant 
Country, such a display of architectural abilities. The 



S 8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

plan of Mr. Hoben who was introduced to me by Doctr. 
Tucker, from Charleston, and who appears to be a very 
judicious man, was made choice of for the President's 
House, and the commissioners have agreed with him to 
superintend the building of it, and that of the Capitol 
also, if they should hereafter be disposed to put both 
under one management. He has been engaged in some 
of the first buildings in Dublin appears a master 
workman and has a great many Lands of his own. He 
has laid out the foundation wchu is now digging, and 
will be back in a month to enter heartily upon the work. 
The plan for the Capitol was not fixed on when I left 
George Town two or three very elegant ones (among 
a great many others of less merit) had been presented 
but the draughts-men not being there, a postponement 
became necessary to receive explanation. The bridge 
will be accomplished (it is said) by the time specified in 
the contract, and everything that could be put in 
motion before the plans for the public Buildings were 
fixed on, is in as much forwardness as could be ex- 
pected & will now I have no doubt advance rapidly. 
As you did not mention having spoken to Mr. Morris 
about the house, I am under some apprehension that 
you omitted doing it, which will be unlucky. Give me 
an acct. of what I suggested to you, as a matter for in- 
direct inquiry. All here are well, except the Majr. 
whose situation I think unpromising & precarious, 
growing worse they all join me in best wishes for Mrs.

Dear Sir, 

I have written but one letter to you since I came to 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 59 

this place I was on the point of writing a second, 
when yours of the 5th. of August came to my hands, 
informing me of your intention of leaving Portsmouth 
about the first of this month and expectation of reach- 
ing Philadelphia (if no unforseen delays happened) the 
soth. this information arrested my intention, as it was 
uncertain at what place to direct to you or, that the 
letter would reach your hands, before it reverberated 
back to that City. 

I feel myself much obliged by the information con- 
tained in your letters of the sist. of July and sth. of 
August, but as I expect soon to see you shall only take 
notice of that part of it which respects a tutor for a few 
boys, and my ardent wish that you may have been able 
to succeed in your expectation of getting one; I am 
more and more persuaded of the utility of the 
measure, and that without it the loss to Washington 
will be irreparable. 

I have nothing agreeable of a domestic nature to re- 
late, and I go not abroad to collect information of any 
other kind. Poor George! He is, I believe not far from 
that place from whence no traveller returns. He is 
but the shadow of what he was ; he has not been out of 
his room and scarcely from his bed these six weeks. 
At times he has intervals of ease which flatter a little, 
but I have little hope of his surviving the winter. This 
adds not a little to my distress and perplexity on a sub- 
ject you are already acquainted with but no more of 
this at least for the present. 

My family and this part of the Country are more 
sickly than they have been since the recollection of 
the oldest of us, first with the flux (but that did not 
prevail in my family) and next with intermittant & 
remittant fevers. All the whites of it however have 
kept up except William whose fever is by an act of 
his own imprudence. 



60 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Not knowing what delays you may have met with 
upon the Road, I have directed Mr. Francis in a letter 
of this date to engage Mr. Page's Coach to be here to ac- 
commodate otir jotirney to Philadelphia, for which 
place I expect to set out about the 8th. though I may 
not arrive in that city before the i3th. or i4th. of Octr. 
The stage however is to be at this place on the yth. at 
-night. If you should be in Philadelphia by the time 
this letter reaches it, I shall rely on your usual punc- 
tuality and expedition to effect this. If the Carriage 
should not be here before the 8th. the case will not be 
altered, as I do not expect Mrs. Washington will leave 
this place before the pth. The sale may require 
my remaining in George Town one day. 

If this letter should find you in Philadelphia, let me 
know the result of your application to Mr. Page, by the 
first Post after it is received. Our united & best wishes 
are offered for yourself Mrs. Lear & the child, and with 
sincere & affectionate regard I am Always Yr. friend

mation, or for recommendation at the opening of the 
Session, and such other matters as result from the laws, 
with wch. it is proper to make the legislature or the 
Senate acquainted. I want to have all the materials 
collected for my communications previous to my arrival 
that when the whole are before me I may select and 
digest into order, such as will be proper for my Speech* 

It is my present intention to commence my journey 
to Philadelphia on this day week, & to spend that and 
part of the following day in George Town, but whether 
I shall be able to do it, is not absolutely certain, as yet. 
William & Richard have both been confined to their 
rooms and mostly to their beds, for ten or 12 days, with 
intermittant fever, which never before yesterday was 
moderate enough to admit the Bark, which makes it 
doubtful at this moment whether they will be in con- 
dition to undertake the journey, if they keep well, and 
a return of the fever I am sure will prevent it. As to 
poor George, I shall say nothing, his fate is unquestion- 
ably fixed and Fanny's from present appearances, is 
very unpromising, probably in terminating in the same 
disorder. These occurrencies throw my private affairs 
into considerable embarrassment; But as they es- 
pecially the Major is not likely to get better, & if they 
do will spend the winter at her father's, I must leave 
them in it as there is no remedy at present. 

The light house at Cape Henry in this State will 
soon want a keeper, & if my memory serves me many 
have offered. Pray examine their characters & have 
them ready to be decided on by the time I arrive.

I had no idea of your obtaining money from Mr. De

the time, we bargained to make the payment stipu- 
lated. It was I am satisfied a speculation on his part

depending upon the Chapter of accidents to comply 
with. Such was the opinion of others at the time 
and such has his conduct evinced since. The dis- 
appointmt. to me is great as I wanted to apply the 
money to particular uses. Public securities (but of 
these I dare sayheisasscarse as he is of Cash) would do. 

Let me know in your next, after the rect. of this

and the opinion of the knowing ones whether the prob- 
ability is that it will rise fall or remain where it is 
for any time. In this State it has fallen, but the scar-

sylvania has not risen, and the opportunity lost 
I wish you would enquire of Mr. Gallitan, and others 
from the Western Country, into whose hands I could, 
to advantage, entrust the management of my business 
in the Counties of Payette & Washington: for I am 
sure it will not do to leave it in the hands of Colo, 
Cannon; who if nothing else is against him, is too de- 
pendent for his election as representative of the latter 
County to fix my rents at a just medium, or to collect 
them in a manner he ought to do, least his popularity 
should be affected by it. And if the Rents are liable 
to be applied (when under leases for 5 years, and after 
farms have been settled 12 or 15 years) towards re- 
pairs and improvements, I may bid adieu to any pros- 
pect of profit from them; as nothing can be easier 
than to balance the acct. by fence rails & such other like 
improvements ; which every man who ever had a farm 
and expected to make any thing on it, always did, & 
for their own sakes ever will be obliged to provide for 
the security of their Crops at their own expence. It is 
ttsual when a Tenant goes on a new place and has every 
thing to provide, to allow him one, two & sometimes 
(according to situation & circumstances) three years 
Rent free; but I never heard before of a continuance 
of it on farms, so long settled as I have mentioned, & 
which have always been in occupation. Nor is it to be 
supposed that a tenant will ever do anything at his 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 65 

own expence, if by agreement he can charge it, toth( 
account of the Land Lord. 

As the will of my deceased Nephew will not be proved 
at next Court for this County, I shall not (unless ob- 
liged to wait for Mr. Robert Lewis, who has written 
me that he shall be here with some Rents & to settle 
some other business with me) remain here till Monday 
the 1 5th. but as I shall (unless advices from Piladel- 
phia, or other occurrencies unknown to me at present 
render it inconvenient) go by the way I had contem- 
plated to come, if the Roads would have permitted it 
that is by Frederick Town in Maryland Carlisle 
Harrisburgh, the upper Canal Reading & the lower 
Canal, it is not in my power at this time to name the 
day when it is probable I shall be in Philadelphia, 
but at any rate if no accident happens; nor my horses 
fail me it will be by the 2$th. of the month at 
farthest.

membrance of her, and joins me in best wishes for your- 
self Mrs. Lear & Lincoln I am always & Sincerely

MOUNT VERNON, April 12th. 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 8th., but as I am 
on the e^e of my return to Philadelphia, and have 
many letters to write, I shall do little more than ac- 
knowledge the receipt of it. The advices which I may 
receive by the Post to-night, will decide whether I 
shall proceed by the direct rout or by the one I intend- 
ed to have come. 

The enclosed from the Attorney General I return to 
him through your hands, that an account and Copy of

it may be taken before you give it to him, wch. should 
be as soon as convenient. 

I always receive the information you convey, and 
your sentiments upon political or other subjects with 
pleasure no apology therefore was necessary for these 
offered in your letter of the above date. I was sorry to 
learn by a letter from Mrs. Washingn. that little Lin- 
coln has been unwell. I hope he is quite recovered. 
My best wishes attend him, Mrs. Lear & yourself 
and I am always Your sincere friend & Affecte.

PHILADELPHIA, June 2ist. 1793. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 1 7th. came by the Post of yester- 
day and as by the purport of it, there is a probability, 
that this letter may find you either at George Town, or 
Mount Vernon, I write it for the purpose of declaring, 
that your going to the latter place is viewed by me as 
a very kind & friendly act. The account given of Mr. 
Whiting by Doctr. Craik, is a very distressing one, not 
only as it respects the poor fellow himself, but on acct. 
of the effect it must have on my business, present and 
to come; during this Year at least. 

Getting an acct. from him (if his situation will en- 
able him to give it) of the monies received and payed, 
and such as may be due, to and from me, is of impor- 
tance, & general view given by him of other matters is 
more to be wished than expected. I shall bring with 
me the accts. he rendered to Mr. Dandridge when I 
was last at Mount Vernon. 

If Mr. Clarke fulfills his engagement (and he says he 
will tho' I think it questionable) I shall, if no business 
more than I am apprised of at present intervenes to 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 67 

prevent it, set out on my journey on Monday; and ex- 
pect to be at George Town, if not at Mount Vernon, on 
Thursday evening. This being the case & as I shall see 
you at one or the other of those places, or must meet 
you on the road, I shall only add that with much truth 
and friendship I am Dr. Sir Yr. ASecte.

MOUNT VERNON, Septr. 25th, 1793- 
My dear Sir, 

I have not written to you since we parted, but had 
just sat down to do it when your letter of the isth. inst. 
was brought to me from the Post Office Alexandria. 

It gave Mrs. Washington, myself, and all who knew 
him sincere pleasure to hear that our little favourite 
had arrived safe and was in good health at Portsmouth 
we sincerely- wish him a long continuance of the lat- 
ter that he may be always as charming and promis- 
ing as he now is that he may live to be a comfort and 
blessing to you and an ornament to his Country. As 
a token of my affection for him, I send him a ticket 
in the lottery that's now drawing in the Federal City; 
& if it should be his fortune to draw the Hotel, it will 
add to the pleasure I feel in giving it* 

We remained in Philadelphia until the loth* inst. 
It was my wish to have stayed there longer, but as Mrs. 
Washington was unwilling to leave me amidst the ma- 
lignant fever which prevailed, I could not think of haz- 
arding her and the children any longer by my remain- 
ing in the City. The house in which we lived, being 
in a manner blockaded by the disorder, which was 
becoming every day more and more fatal. I therefore 
came off with them on the above day, and arrived at 



68 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

this place the i4th- without encountering the least 
accident on the Road. 

You will learn from Mr. Greenleaf that he has 
dipped deeply in the concerns of the Federal City; ad- 
vantageously I think for himself and I am pleased with 
it, on public ground also, as it may give facility to the 
operations at that place, at the same time that it is em- 
barkg. him in a measure which, although it cannot well 
fail under any circumstances that are likely to happen, 
may be considerably promoted by men of spirit with 
large Capitals. He can so much better than I detail 
Ms engagements & the situation of things in and about 
the City, that I shall not attempt to do it at present. 

Mrs. Washington having decided to let Nelly Cus- 
tis have her Watch and Chain, is disposed to receive 
substitutes in lieu thereof at about Twenty five guineas 
price, and leaves the choice of them to you. - The plain- 
ness of the Watch &c. will be no objection, One him- 
dred and twenty Dollars, in Bank Notes are enclosed 
for the purchase of them. 

If it should be convenient, and perfectly safe for you 
to engage for me, on reasonable terms a complete Black 
Smith, you would oblige me by doing so. As there 
are laws in Engknd prohibiting such engagements 
under severe penalties, and such may exist in other 
Countries, you will understand me clearly that for no 
consideration whatsoever would I have you run the 
smallest risk of encountering them you know full well 
what kind of a smith would suit my purposes, it is un- 
necessary therefore for me to be particular on this head. 
He must however have a character on which you can 
rely, not only as a complete workman for a farm, but as 
an honest, sober and industrious man. If he conies on 
wages they must be moderate ; & with or without wages, 
he must be bound to serve me three years four would 
be better

P. S. 

I have just reed, a letter from the Earl of Buchan in 
which he says my letter intended to accompany the 
Portrait had got safe to his hands, but that he had seen 
nor heard nothing of the Picture. If you should while 
in New York see the painter of it, be so good as to men- 
tion this circumstance to him, and inquire into the 
cause of the failure. 

The District Attorney of New Hampshire, has sent his 
resignation. I am entirely unacquainted with the 
Characters in that line, in that State, and would thank 
you to name the person whom you think best qualified 
to succeed Mr. Sherburne & most likely to give general 
satisfaction.

PHILADELPHIA, 6th* May 1794. 

My dear Sir , 

Your letter of the 26th- of Jany. with a Post Script 
of the 3oth. of the same month, by Capt. Truxton and 
another of the i2th. of Feby. by a vessel to New York 
I have safely reed. But neither the one from Glasgow 
(with the box) nor the other by the Peggy, refered to 
in the above letters, are yet come to hand* 

The Watch and Portrait of the Earl of Buchan, were 
reed, in very good order. The first pleases, and for 
your attention to it, Mrs. Washington prays you to ac- 



70 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

cept her thanks. The extra Cost, together with the 
prices of the other articles from Glasgow and London, 
shall be paid so soon as I can find a person disposed to 
receive the amount, & this I shall know probably, when 
I converse, with Mr. Dalton; who, I believe, is on a 
visit to the Federal City; as he proposed to set out for 
it on Monday last. 

The reception you met with from the Earl of Buchan 
and Sir John Sinclair, gives me sincere pleasure, and 
I am glad to find they have introduced you to char- 
acters, which may not only contribute to your present 
gratifications, but which in the Revolution of events, 
may be of service in .a future walk of life, without a 
possible disservice, that results not from imprudence; 
against which your own good sence will always 
secure you. 

I am much obliged to you for the several communi- 
cations in your letters which have come to hand. I 
place great reliance on them. The opportunities you 
derive from mixing with people in different walks 
high and low of different descriptions, and of differ- 
ent political Sentiments, must have afforded you, an 
extensive range fpr observation and Comparison, ' 
more so by far than could fall to the lot of a stationary 
Character, who is always revolving in a particular 
Circle. 

I am equally well pleased to hear that the concerns, 
in which you are more immediately interested are in as 
promising a train as the peculiarly disturbed state of 
matters in Europe would allow you to expect. I hope 
they will continue, and that your plans may be accom- 
plished to the fullest extent of your wishes. 

Mr. Pearce my present manager at Mount Vernon, 
has been directed to send for your fruit Trees the mo- 
ment he hears of the Peggy's arrival at George Town; 
and my Gardner is instructed to take particular care 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 71 

of them until they are otherwise disposed of by you; 
but as the Vessel had not arrived the 29th. Ulto. (when 
I heard from Mr. Pearce) there is much reason to fear 
they will come too late, as a mild and placid March and 
pleasant April (except the first days of it) have caused 
a most luxuriant vegetation this Spring with us from 
North-to-South. 

Not knowing where you may be, when this letter 
shall have reached London, nor the hazzard it may 
run in following you, if you should have left that 
Metropolis, I shall do little more than touch political 
subjects. To tell you that the order of his Britanic 
Majesty in Council of the 8th. of June last, respecting 
neutral Vessels had given much discontent to the 
United States and that, that of the 6th. of Novem- 
ber, and its results, had thrown them into a flame, will 
hardly be news to you when you shall have reed, this 
letter. The subsequent order of the 8th. of Jany. has 
in a degree allayed the violence of the heat, but will by 
no means satisfy them, without reparation for the 
Spoliations of our Trade & the injuries we sustain for 
the non-performance of the Treaty of Peace. 

To effect these, if possibly by temperate means, by 
fair & firm negociation, an Envoy extraordinary is ap- 
pointed, & will, I expect sail in a few days. Mr. Jay is 
chosen for this mission Mr. John Trumbull goes as 
his private Secretary. 

Many measures have been moved in Congress in con- 
sequence of the above mentioned orders of the British 
Cabinet. Some have passed into Acts and others are 
yet pending. Those which have become Laws are, 
one for fortifying our principal Sea Ports (Xhich is 
now in vigorous execution) and another for raising 
an additional corps of 800 artillery men, for the de- 
fence of them, & for other purposes. The Bills which 
are pending are to complete our present Military 



72 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

establishment, to raise an army of 25,000 men in ad- 
dition thereto, and to organize put in training 
and to hold in readiness at a minute's warning, a Select 
Corps of 80,000 militia. Of the passing of the first & 
last of these no doubt seems to be entertained on either 
side of the House, but those who are fearful of what 
they call a standing army, will give all the opposition 
they can to the other. The result therefore none will 
predict, in the present stage of the business. 

Besides these a Bill passed the house of Represent- 
atives, by a large majority, founded on the following 
preamble & resolution "whereas the injuries which 
"have been suffered, and may be suffered by the 
"United States from violations committed by Great 
* * Britain, on their neutral Tights & Commercial interests, 
"as well as from her failure to execute the yth, article 
*' of the treaty of Peace render it expedient for the inter- 
" est of the United States, that the Commercial interr 
" course between the two Countries should not continue 
*Ho be carried on in the extent at present allowed" 

"Resolved, that from and after the first day of 
''November next all commercial intercourse between 
" the Citizens of the United States, and the .Subjects of 
" the King of Great Britain, or the Citizens or Subjects 
" of any other nation, so far as the same respects articles 
" of the growth or manufacture of G. Britain or Ireland 
"shall be prohibited/' 

This measure was arrested in the Senate at the third 
reading, by the Casting vote of the Vice President 
not, as it is said and generally believed, from a disinclina- 
tion, to the ulterior expediency of the measure, but from 
a desire to try the effect of negociation previous thereto* 

Sequestration of British property (not including that 
in the funds) and other expedients of a similar kind 
have been agitated in the house of Representatives,, 
but seem I think to be talked off the Stage. 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 73 

^ The Packet from Mr. Bartrand to Mr. Jefferson was 
forwarded by the first post after it reached my hands. 
Mr. Jefferson resigned the Office of Secretary of State 
the first of Jany. and was succeeded by the late 
Attorney General Mr. Randolph, whose place of At- 
torney General is filled by Judge Bradford, of this State 
(Pennsylva.) 

Enclosed I give you the trouble of receiving the Copy 
of a letter which I wrote to Mr, Arthur Young, by Mr. 
William Morris on the i2th. of December last. At the 
time that letter was written I had no knowledge of Mr. 
Young's late appointment, as Secretary of the National 
board of Agriculture, nor of the change of his political 
sentiments. It is not improbable but that he has al- 
ready, or will, make you acquainted, with the purport 
of the above letter. Be this however as it may, my 
inducement to send you a Copy of it is, that if the case 
should be otherwise if there appears to be any repug- 
nance on his part to Comply with my wishes, and a 
fair occasion should occur of mentioning the matter in 
the course of your peregrinations, through England 
Scotland or elsewhere, & you see no impropriety from 
Circumstances or your view of the subject at the mo- 
ment I should be glad if you were to do it; my wish 
further is to dispose of the Lands, I have had restored 
to me, by Mr. de Barth ; and in short my settled lands 
in the Western Part of this State, in the Counties of 
Payette & Washington. I have raised the price of 
my lands on the Ohio and great Kanhawa to twenty 
Shillings Virga. , Currency P. Acre, the Tract in 
Fayette (about 1700 acres) to 40, and that in Wash- 
ington to 30 Shillings Pr. Acre, Pennsylvania Currency, 
3,000 Acs. 

I have no scruple to disclose to you, that my motives 
to these sales (as hath been in part expressed to Mr. 
Young) are to reduce my income be it more or less to 



74 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

specialties ; that the remainder of my days, may there- 
by, be more tranquil and free from cares ; and that I 
may be enabled (knowing precisely what my depend- 
ence is) to do as much good with it as the resource will 
, admit for altho* in the estimation of the world, I 
possess a good and clear estate, yet so unproductive is 
it, that I am oftentimes ashamed to refuse aids which 
I cannot afford, unless I was to sell part of it, to answer 
the purpose. Besides these I have another motive 
which makes me earnestly wish for these things it is 
indeed more powerful than all the rest namely to 
liberate a certain species of property which I possess 
very repugnantly to my own feelings; but which im- 
perious necessity compels, and until I can substitute 
some other expedient, by which expences, not in my 
power to avoid (however well disposed I may be to do 
it) can be defrayed. 

You are so well acquainted with the situation and 
quality of the Lands which are here mentioned for sale, 
that is almost unnecessary for me to go more into de- 
tail respecting them with you those however on the 
Ohio, between the mouths of the little and great Kan- 
hawa are in three tracts, the first containing 2314 
Acres, laying on the Banks of the River, about 12 
miles below Mariatte the 2d. 2448 acres still lower 
down (being the 4th. large bottom on the East side of 
the River) and the 3d. on the same side, opposite the 
great bend in the River, containg. 4395 acres, all of 
which are of the first quality. The lands on the great 
Kanhawa are in no respect inferior. They are con- 
tained in four Patents ; the first beginning within two 
miles of the mouth of that River & contains 10,990 
Acres of the richest bottom, stretching 17 or 1 8 miles 
along the River. The next of 7276 Acres, is a little 
above the last on the opposite side of the River, & the 
other two are still higher up at the mouth of, and on 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 7 5 

Coal River ; both, are of the first quality & containing 
together abt. 5,000 Acres. 

Although it is my wish to convert these Lands into 
cash on the terms and for the purposes mentioned, yet 
for reasons which will readily occur to you, I would not 
hawk them about as some do, if they were never to be 
sold. 

I wish most sincerely that some inducement could 
be offered Professor Anderson which would bring him 
to this Country. His labours are certainly ingenious, 
and worthy encouragement, but I fear it will not be in 
my power to avail these States of them. His commu- 
nications however are under consideration. 

Often, through the medium of Mr. Langdon, we 
hear of your son Lincoln, and with pleasure, that he 
continues to be the healthy and sprightly child he for- 
merly was. He declared if his ticket should turn up a 
prize, he would go and live in the Federal City. He 
did not consider, poor little fellow, that some of the 
prizes would hardly build him a baby house nor for- 
see that one of these small tickets would be his lot, 
having drawn no more than ten dollars. 

Mr. Bl t's Agency in this lottery will it is feared 

be more productive of thorns than roses ; the matter 
is not yet wound up, and the Commissioners appear 
to be uneasy. In all other respects matters as far as 
the accts. of them have come, to my knowledge, are 
going on well. 

My public avocations, will not at any rate admit of 
more than a flying trip to Mount Vernon for a few days, 
this summer: This not suiting Mrs. Washington, I 
have taken a house in Germantown, to avoid the heat 
of this City, in the months of July and August she, 
Nelly and the rest of the family, unite with me in

GERMAN TOWN, August 28th. 1794. 

My dear Sir, 

It gave me very sincere pleasure to find by your 
letter of the 2 ad. inst. (which by the by did not come 
to my hands 'till the evening of the 2 6th. not time 
enough to acknowledge the receipt of it by the Post of 
next day) that you had arrived in good health at 
George Town, with a valuable Cargo, of Goods, and 
that you had arranged your business to your satis- 
faction in England, Scotland, & Holland. When you 
shall have arranged your business at George Town, and 
business or inclination may turn your face towards the 
Eastwards, it will be unnecessarjr to add that to see 
you would make this family happy; and with a little 
roughing on your part, you could be accommodated 
therein. 

If you have no accts. later I have the pleasure to tell 
you, that by a letter from your good mother to Mrs. 
Washington, that she and little Lincoln were perfectly 
well on the nth. of this month, and by her acct. he 
continued to be the fine sprightly child you left him. 

The enclosed though out of season now will serve to 
show that your letters did not sleep with me in silence. 
It went by Mr. Jay, and was returned by him with the 
following papagraph, or letter, dated 
London, 23d. June. 

"On Sunday the i$th. of this month I arrived here. 
"The next day I made enquiries for Mr. Lear, and was 
** informed that he had gone to Liverpool to embark for 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 77 

"America. I asked whether It was probable, that 
"letters sent by the Post would find him still there 
" the answer was that it was highly mprobable. Under 
"these circumstances, and well knowing the jealous 
"attention now paid to letters passing thro' the Post 
" Office, I thought it most advisable to forbear making 
"the experiment, and to return that letter to you." 

The Copy of my letter to Mr. Young from whom I 
have reed, no acknowledgment, will be of no other use 
to you now, than to show what were and still are my 
wishes ; that if any inqtiiries after, for back lands should 
be made in your presence, you might be enabled to 
bring mine into view. The plan with respect to my 
Mount Vernon Estate I have no idea could be carried 
into effect in this Country* 

I had it in contemplation to visit that place about 
the last of September or beginning of Octr, but the re- 
bellious conduct of the people in the Western Counties 
of this state renders the journey uncertain, and may 
defeat it altogether. 

With very great Sincerity & Affection 
I am always Yours

GERMAN TOWN s8th. Augt. 1794* 

Dear Sir, 

Mr. Johnson & Doctr. Stuart having resolved to with- 
draw themselves as Commissioners of the Federal City 
and not to act after the meeting which is proposed 
to be held on the i5th. of next month, it has become 
necessary to appoint two others in their places, one 
of whom it is said ought to possess a considerable stock 
of legal abilities, as cases are frequently occuring to 
render law knowledge necessary for the purposes of de- 
ciding as well on points depending thereon, as for the 



78 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

draughting of Agreements & other instruments which 
are requisite in the progress of the business. 

Mr. Scott (at present of Baltimore) a gentleman 
eminent in the profession of the law, a man of Charac- 
ter & fortune, and one who has the welfare of the New 
City much at heart has been applied to, and accepted 
the appointed trust* And if it is convenient & agree- 
able to you, to accept also, the commission will be 
again compleated ; & the business go on without inter- 
ruption, from and after the ensuing meeting as before. 

It has been found from experience, indispensibly 
necessary that the Commissioners should reside in 
the City (in George Town would be tantamount) and 
devote by some arrangements among themselves, much 
of their time to the multitudinous concerns of the same ; 
thereby superceding the necessity of employing a 
Superintendant. As the rendering of such duties are 
not to be expected on the terms the late Commissioners 
served (and two of them decline it on any terms) I 
have now fixed the Salary for each at sixteen hundred 
dollars P. Annum, and am obliged to provide successors. 

Were it not that I am unwilling to add any thing 
that might carry with it, the appearance of influencing 
your judgment, in the decision you are called upon to 
make in this case, I should have expressed a wish that 
it might be found convenient for you to accept the ap- 
pointment. If however you should find it incompat- 
ible with your other plans & views, & should decline the 
acceptance I pray you to let me know, as far as you 
may be able to discover, in how respectable a light Doctr. 
Thornton stands, or would be considered by the pro- 
prietors of the Federal City (among whom he spent 
some time in the month of July last). The Doctr. is 
sensible and indefatigable I am told in the execution of 
whatever he engages; to which may be added, his 
taste for architecture; but being little known, doubts 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 79 

arise on that head. If (in case of your non-accept- 
ance) any other person or persons shd. occur to you, 
as fit for this business, be so good as to mention 
(under the rose) their names to me. The appoint- 
ment is necessary & can be delayed no longer. 
With very great esteem & regard 
I am dear Sir 

Your Affecte. Servt.

GERMAN TOWN, 3ist. Augt. 1794. 

My dear Sir, 

On the 28th. I wrote you two letters. In one of them 
I intended (but forgot it) to have made a request that 
you would enquire after the lad that used to wait at 
Suter 's (William I think his name was) whose servitude 
had expired, and if disengaged and his character good, 
as well as handy, to engage him for me at eight Dollars 
P. Month, (with the other allowances known to you) 
being what I am now obliged to give, to the most in- 
different set of servants I ever had. When I mention 
William I do not mean to confine myself to him, al- 
though his qualifications as a waiter (the only light in 
which he has appeared to me) to be very good; any 
other genteel looking and well made man (not a giant 
or dwarf) might answer equally well perhaps, if sober, 
honest, good tempered, and acquainted with the duties 
of a house Servant, & footman. 

Sincerely & affectionately 
I remain Yours

second payment for the lots I purchased on the Eastern

You are perfectly at liberty to examine my presses

the papers you are in pursuit of are to be found in the

the keys of the locked trunks are, if I remember rightly, 
in my writing Table; the key of which remains in it. 

For many very important reasons (unnecessary to 
enumerate to you) the navigation of that River ought 
to be pushed forward with all the celerity, which the 
nature of the work will admit; Veiwing the matter as 
I do, I shall not neglect any fair opportunity of facili- 
tating a visit from Mr. Weston to that quarter but 
(under the rose I must say it) however fair the assur- 
ances of his going thither may be, you may take it for 
granted that from motives of jealousy there is a Counter- 
tide to that measure ; and I wish you may not find 
something similar to it in another quarter, if the oper- 
ations on the Shannondoah are postponed much 
longer. Do not forget how the Trade of Fredericksburg 
Falmouth, Hanover Town on York River, & indeed 
Richmond itself, will be effected by the opening of this 
Navigation I should not be at all surprised therefore 
if future applications to the Assembly of Virga. (if 
there be occasion to make any) respecting it should 
meet with much coldness and difficulty. 

I should not any more than you, be disposed to con- 
fide in the opinion of Mr. Claiborne's Engineer; nor 
(in confidence to you) to Mr. Claiborne himself; but 
as he speaks in exalted terms of this man (for you must 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 81 

know Claiborne is now in this City and has mentioned 
the matter also to me) a little money might not be mis- 
applied in obtaining the opinion of this Engineer; to 
see how far it would accord with Mr. Weston's if he 
can be got there; without, if he should follow after, 
letting him know what that opinion is. Tis possible 
this person may unite (as Claiborne says he does) both 
Science & practice. If so, and he should possess other 
requisites, he might be useful. Tryal of, without a 
relyance upon him, cannot be injurious. 

Mr. Jonathan Trumbull has once or twice asked me 
what reply the Commissioners of the Federal have made 
to the letter of his brother John which I sent to them 
be so good as to remind them, or either of them wch. 
you may first see of this matter.

PHILADELPHIA, Deer. i4th. 1794." 

My dear Sir, 

The day following the one on which I wrote to you 
last your letter of the loth. inst. was received. 

It is to be regretted exceedingly that delegated pow- 
ers are, of ten-times so little regarded; and that trusts 
of an important nature, the neglect of which, may be 
attended with serious consequences, should be suffered 
to sleep in the hands of those who ought to carry them 
into activity. Such from your representation appears 
to be the case of the Petition which ought in behalf of 
the Potomac Compy. to have been laid before the 
Assembly of Virginia in due Season* 

The notice of the intended presentment of such 
Petitions (which is required by law) cannot I presume 
be dispensed with; and if there be any derilection to 
the pleasures prayed for, the limitation to & expira- 



S 2 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

tion of the time for the reception of them will be urged 
as a plea for Postponement. 

The propriety of my writing to individual members, 
or even to the Assembly itself, on this subject is, in my 
mind, a matter that may be questioned ; but suppos- 
ing the case to be otherwise, I do not know who the 
members are; and such indeed has been the change of 
things, since I mixed in the politics ; or much with the 
people of that State, (and of the neighbourhood of 
Alexandria) that an entire new set unknown to me 
personally, are in the exercise of the powers of Govern- 
ment. To morrow however I will communicate this 
matter to Mr. Randolph, and know if he has any ac- 
quaintances, in that Assembly, to whom he could intro- 
duce the subject, and thereby aid your personal ex- 
ertions. J Tis to be lamented however that in plain 
matters & little ticklishly circumstanced such haz- 
zards (at least of delay) should be unnecessarily en- 
countered. We are all well, and join in best wishes 
for you and I am

PHILADELPHIA, Deer. aist. 1794. 
My dear Sir, 

Your letter of the iyth. Inst. was received Yesterday, 
and I am glad to find that an act of the Virginis As- 
sembly has been obtained for prolonging the term for 
the completion of the inland navigation of the Poto- 
mac. The like I hope has been, or will be obtained, 
this Season, in the assembly of Maryland. 

A good opportunity presenting itself on Thursday 
last, I embraced it to inquire of Mr. Morris if the Di- 
rectors of that Company might entertain any hope of 
deriving aid from Mr. Weston's opinion, respecting 
the lock Seats at the great fall of that River; his 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 83 

answer was, "Mr. Weston, from some peculiar circum- 
stances attending their own concerns, had been pre- 
" vented from visiting that spot as was intended, but 
"that he was now expected to be in this City in a few 
"days (as I understood) when he would propose and 
"urge his going thither. " 

The plan of Mr. Claiborne's Engineer, as far as I 
understand it is to avoid locks altogether. The vessels 
are received into a Basket or Cradle, and let down by 
means of a laver and pullies; and raised again by 
Weights at the hinder extremity of the laver, which 
works on an axis at the head of a substantial Post, fixed 
about the Center of the laver. On this principle but 
differently constructed, Mr. Greenleafafew months ago 
shewed me a model, the efficacy of which he seemed to 
entertain the most exalted opinion. My doubts of the 
utility of both arise, first from the insufficiency of any 
machinery of this sort to bear the weight of the Cradle 
when charged with Water & a loaded Boat therein; 
and its aptness to get out of order by means thereof; 
Secondly I do not find they are in general use ; and 
thirdly because if I recollect rightly Mr. Weston 
has told me (but of this I am not certain) that no 
method of raising and lowering boats had been found 
equal to that of locks still, as I observed in my last, I 
should be for hearing the opinions & explanations of 
any and every scientific and practical character that 
could be easily got at, on the subject: & therefore 
would hear Claiborne's Engineer as well as Mr. 
Weston; especially as he professes to be particularly 
well skilled in the application of steam, in propelling 
Boats (in an easy and cheap manner) against the 
Stream; and in conducting of Water to Cities, or for 
any other purpose whatsoever. 

The Bill you allude to has not passed nor do I know 
what shape it will take if it does ; & therefore can say 



84 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

nothing more on the subject at this time, than that, 
there will be no precipitancy, in engaging either the 
Agent or the means of carrying the law into effect, if 
the measure which I have recommended should be 
adopted ; with the importance of it I am strongly im- 
pressed ; consequently if any thing should be required 
of the president towards carrying of it into execution, 
I shall feel it in a particular manner, my duty to set it 
a going under the most favorable auspices. 

I now have and for some considerable time have had 
twenty five Hhds. Tobo. in the Ware houses in Al- 
exandria, which at some times I have forgot, and at 
other times have been indisposed to take the prices 
which were given for Potomac Tobo. on the Virginia 
side. Originally this Tobacco was of the best sort put 
tip dry & the quality of it reported to be exceedingly 
good. If the latter is the case still, it will in some re* 
pects, and for some purposes, have the advantage of 
New Tabacco ; but what to do with it I know not. In 
Alexandria it might not bring me i8/ P. Hundred 
Wt. when in George Town (I mean in the ware houses 
in these places) it might bring a guinea. I have 
thought, but whether it will be practicable to accom- 
plish it without difficulty I am unable to decide, that 
if the Tobo. could be removed from the Ware houses 
in which it now is, to those in George Town & be rein- 
spected at the latter, that I might be a considerable 
gainer by it. But admitting that this can be done 
without encountering impediments which might in- 
volve inconveniencies ; or that would excite notice or 
remark, neither of which I should incline to subject 
myself to, it would be previously necessary to know 
whether the Tobacco would pass at the latter place, 
for if it should be brought there and be condemned, I 
should lose the whole and sustain an expence besides, 
whereas in its present situation, it will I presume com- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 85 

mand the price current in Alexandria. If the sug- 
gestion here mentioned can be accomplished (without 
involving the consequencies expressed above) the best 
expedient that occurs to me to effect it, is tinder the 
idea of its being purchased by, or rather offered for 
sale to a Maryland Merchant, to have it re-examined 
where it is in presence of the George Town Inspectors 
who would be paid for their attendance, & who should 
declare to the supposed purchaser whether they would- 
pass it were it brought to the Ware houses in George 
Town. If in the affirmative, and there is no other im- 
pediment to the measure, the whole business might be 
easily accomplished by the removal, reinspection, & 
issuing new notes, either in my name or that of the 
supposed purchaser; the last of which for several 
reasons I think would have the best appearance*- 
Whether this project can be carried into execution or 
not is to me uncertain but to avoid delay and in order 
to enable you to do it if it shall be thought eligable, I 
send you the Notes for this purpose, and to know what 
the Tobacco would sell for where it is, if it be not 
eligable to remove it they may be kept or returned 
according to circumstances. In the Ware houses at 
George Town I have or ought to have by this time, 
9000 Ibs. of Crop Tobo. as you will perceive by the 
enclosed letter to me from Colo, Deakins, the price of 
this also. 

I return Doctr. Currie's letter with thanks for the 
perusal of it. The picture drawn in it of the state of 
things in his own Counry, and the details wch. he gives 
of those of the BelHgeiient powers are gloomy for

I also send you the sketch which has been presented 
to me by Mr. Claiborne, of the New Method of low- 
ering and raising boats, without locks. It will convey 
a better Idea than my description of it in the letter of

single point; namely, to inform you as I have been 
informed myself, that in a late meeting of the Canal 
Company of this State permission was given to Mr. 
Weston to visit the lock seats at the great falls of Poto-

mac, and that he might be expected there about the 
first of next month. 

I am Your Affecte 

No. 52. 

PHILADELPHIA, Jany isth. 1795. 
My dear Sir, 

On Friday last I wrote you a few lines and assigned 
reasons for not writing more fully. 

In addition to what I then said, which was only to 
inform you, that permission had been given by the 
Canal Compy. of this state for Mr. Weston to visit the 
falls of Potomac, and that he might be expected at the 
Federal City about the first of next month, I shall no- 
.tice with concern it being contrary to the heretofore 
entertained opinion that the funds for carrying on 
navigation are from your view of them likely to fall 
short ^10,000 Stg. of the object. 
- What expedient had best be adopted for suppyling 
the deficiency will merit serious consideration under 
icxisting Circumstances. On an abstract of the Case, 
I should give it as my opinion, without hesitation, that 
the present sharers ought to continue their advances 
till the final completion; & for this plain & interesting 
reason, (with me) that no speculation to which money 
an be applied will be more productive, with so much 
honour, and so little risque. But how far the majority 
X3f the Company (many of whom probably never be- 
stowed a thought on the Subject) may be of this senti- 
ment; or how far their inclinations and abilities might 
induce the adoption of the measure if they were is not 
for me to decide and as individuals of the Company 
will be as free as others to become purchasers if the 
shares are increased, it does not appear to be a matter 
of much moment which of these modes is prefered, or 
whether by loan if the money is to be obtained. 



88 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

No doubt remains in my mind of what will be the 
productiveness of the tolls when the navigation is in 
full operation- To the best of my recollection they 
were calculated to amount (at the time of passing the 
acts of incorporation) to 15 P. Cent on the Capital, by 
an estimate that was then made of the several articles 
which from their contiguity to the River it was known 
would be Water borne. Since that period the pop- 
ulation of the Counties bordering on the Potomac & of 
course the produce arising therefrom has encreased 
greatly, and when the Shenendoah is added thereto 
(which formed no part of the Original estimate) it must 
equal the most sanguine expectation. 

Mr. Claiborne's Engineers (for it seems he has two 
for different purposes) are fixed in this City, either of 
which according to the use for which you want one, 
might be had at any time, but as I am not strongly im- 
pressed with a belief that men of eminence would come 
to this Country in the manner, and under the circum- 
stances, they have done (but this I say without having 
knowledge of the real characters of the gentlemen, & 
without design to injure them) might it not be politic 
to obtain the opinion of the most competent of them, 
before Mr. Weston (who is known to be a Scientific & 
experienced Engineer) gives his? He will not adopt 
their opinion contrary to his experience & judgment; 
but if his opinion is first taken and transpires, it may 
be given into by them from the want of these in them- 
selves, endeavoring thereby to erect a character on his 
foundation. 

I am much obliged by the trouble of your enquiries 
respecting my Tobacco in the Ware houses at Alexan- 
dria & George Town, and as the disposal of it is some 
what out of my way at present and in truth is a mat- 
ter that rarely occurs to me, except when I am 
reminded of it by Mrs. Washington, you would add

whensoever in yottr judgmt. the moment is favorable, 
I am in no hurry nor tinder any necessity to pre- 
cipitate the Sale, & to your judgment also it is left, to 
continue where it is or to remove the Tobacco from 
Alexandria to George Town. We are all tolerable well 
& join in good wishes & the Compliments of the Season

PHILADELPHIA, i8th. Feby. 1795. 
Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the i3th. Inst. came to me yesterday 
previous to which your other letters of the 24th. & 3oth. 
Ulto. had been duly received. 

About a fortnight ago I saw & spoke to Mr. Weston 
myself respecting his visit to the falls of Potomac, and 
wished if he was able that he would name the time he 
would, or expected, to be there. He answered about 
the last of the month. That he had to return first to 
Lebanon (near to which they are digging the Canal be* 
tween the Waters of Susquehanna & SchuylMll) and 
should proceed from thence. As it is more than prob- 
able than his rout will be by the way of Carlisle 
Shippensburgh, Chambersburgh, and Hagerstown, 
above the mountain,- or if not by that course, it will 
be through York & Frederick Town below it; and in 
either case that he will return by Baltimore, it is to be 
regretted (as in a former letter you expressed a wish 
that he should see the Shannondoah near its conflyence 
with the Potomack) that some previous arrangement 
could not have been made for the purpose of meeting 
him at or near the spot you wished him to view above. 
This for many reasons I could not propose nor had I ail 
opportunity of doing it admitting the propriety of the 



9 o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

measure, as it was on a public day (in what is called the 
Levee Room) and just as he was leaving the City that 
I saw him. Some embarrassments respecting the busi- 
ness of the Canal Companies in this State brought and 
detained him here longer than was expected; but 
this circumstance was unknown to me until the moment 
of his departure, otherwise I should have seen him 
sooner, and would have conversed more fully with him 
on his proposed visit. To his detention here may be 
ascribed his not being with you at an earlier day than 
is now thought of. 

Much has been said of late of the inclined plain in 
Connecticut River, of the utility of it I mean; It 
would be well, I think, to question Mr. Weston pretty 
fully on this mode of raising and lowering Boats, as 
the simplicity, cheapness, and effect is the subject of 
Eulogium deservedly or not, I shall not undertake 
to pronounce. 

The family are all well. Betcy & Mr. & Mrs. Peter, 
left this on Monday morning for N ew York to return on 
Saturday. Mrs. Washington & the other two join me 
in every good wish for you and

PHILADELPHIA, March 4th- 1795. 

My dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 2$d. Ulto. came duly to hand. The 
letters which I write to acquaintances, or friends, are 
done at no great expence of time or thought They 
are off hand productions, with little attention to compo- 
sition or correctness; and even under these circum- 
stances are rarely attempted when they interfere with 
my public duties. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 91 

From what you have written and from what I have 
heard from others, I hope Mr. Weston is on the Poto- 
mack 'ere this ; and that much benefit may be expected 
from the visit. He is certainly a judicious man ; with 
both theory and Practice united. I am pleased to hear 
that the Locks which have been erected at the little 
falls have stood the test of a first trial so well; and 
this* pleasure will be increased if Mr. Weston should 
make a favorable report of them. 

An unlucky dispute has happened, or is likely to hap- 
pen, I find between the present Commissioners and 
Mr. Johnson (one of the old set). These things under 
any view in which they can be placed, are extremely 
unpleasant, & are rendered more so, when they are 
brought before me. The points in dispute have not 
come before me in detail the main one I am told is, 
whether the lots adjoining Rock Creek above the Stone 
Bridge, come under the description of Water lotts; and 
would be so construed in the contract between the for- 
mer Commissioners & Mr. Greenleaf. From what I 
have learnt it is a question of some magnitude, in as 
much as establishing a principle applicable to that case, 
wiU have an extensive effect in favour of or adverse to 
the public property in the City- This being the case 
let me ask you to collect the Sentiments of the judicious 
about you in the City & in George Town, as far as it is 
to be drawn from casual (at least not from forced) con- 
versation respecting the dispute, and to inform me 
thereof^ You will readily perceive that it is for my 
own and private information my request to you pro- 
ceeds: both the request and answer to it, will then of 
course be confined to ourselves.

as was the certificate of the Shares, which was bought

Your preference of the former for the appropriation 
of the balance which remain in your hands, is accord- 
ant with my ideas; and unless you have very good 
reasons to believe that the shares may be had at par by 
delaying the purchase of them, it might be as well per- 
haps to buy at the prices now going (especially if the

to await for a fall.

Your letters of the igth.fe Ulto. came duly to hand, 
and I expected 'ere this to have been decisive upon the 
contents of them; but the case being otherwise, I 
shall postpone writing fully to you until the next or 
another Post. 

It may not be amiss however briefly to observe that 
Colo. Rochfontain (being in this City) was asked how 
it came to pass, as he had seen the site at the conflu- 
ence of the two Rivers Potomac & Shanandoah, he had 
made no mention of it in his general Report? His 
answer was, there was no ground on which convenient 
buildings could be placed, and assigned other reasons 
in a written report, which he made. But since the re- 
ceipt of your last, with a letter from Genl. Darke to 
the Secretary of War I have suggested his going there 
again in order to view the ground more accurately. 
This, if nothing more pressing shall require his attend- 
ance in another quarter, will be the case. I shall de- 
fer therefore saying any thing further on the subject 
till the matter is decided. If the Colo, goes at all, he

will probably pass through George Town, and if it could 
be made convenient for Col- Gilpin (who understands 
the nature and application of water well) and yourself 
to accompany him advantages, I am persuaded, 
would result from the journey. One of the Colo's, ob- 
jections to this site is that no water work (on acct. of 
freshets) would be safe there. These lands, however 
considering the reservations of the Perries, buildings 
&c. will come much higher than I had any idea of. 

If you have not already agreed for the rent of my 
house in Alexandria @ Sixty pounds Pr. Annum, I 
wish this sum might be compared with other rents, be- 
fore it is fixed on. I was told by several as I passed 
through Alexandria, that I might readily dispose of 
the lot, if I was so inclined, for 1200 : Sixty pounds 
rent would only be an interest of 5 P. Cent which is 
inadequate for house rent.

of getting some of the new Shares subscribed for by the 
Maryland assembly is so good ; I wish as good a dis- 
position may be found in the other assembly: but 
above all that your means would enable you to pro- 
ceed vigorously to the improvement of the Navigation 
of the Shenandoah River; for that is the Source from 
whence the wealth of the City is to be derived. 

If the Directors are in want of such a character, as 
the enclosed letter describes, it may be well to intimate 
it as soon as possible ; as it is not likely that Mr. Myers 
will remain long unemployed, as lock navigation is 
contemplated in many parts of this Country. I have 
not seen the Gentleman myself, but understand from 
others that his testimonials are full & ample, & that he 
is a stout & healthy man* 

Your opening Mr. Maury's letter to me was a thing 
of necessity, and I am obliged to you for having done 
so ; and for the steps you took consequent thereupon 
& for sending the goods to Mount Vernon* 

If I cannot get a full rent for my house in Alexan- 
dria, I must be content with what it will fetch, and 
that without delay; otherwise (the cold weather 
approaching) the inclosures will be torn down for 
firing, if no other damage is sustained from its being left 
unoccupied. My love to Fanny & children. 
I am always, & Sincerely 
Your affectionate

I will send to and have a little conversation with Mr. 
Myers and give you the result in my next.

No- 62. 

PHILADELPHIA, ad. Deer. 1795. 

My dear Sir, 

* Since writing to you on Monday I have seen & con- 
versed with Mr. Myers; who isdesirotts of employment, 
and of removing from this place, which (having a 
pretty large family) he finds very expensive. He pro- 
fesses to understand perfectly the various matters set 
forth in the card I enclosed you in my last ; and was 
employed according to his own acct. in the Lancashire 
navigation in England, until the call for Soldiers took 
away most of the hands. This circumstance, added 
to a desire to fix his fortunes in America, where he has 
some property in Land, and his wife is a native, 
induced him to embark for this Country. 

He disapproves of Locks, made of wood but under- 
stands them in all their parts. He is healthy in ap- 
pearance, stout & Robust, and of a good humored counte- 
nance. He professes to be moderate in his expecta- 
tions; and willing to put himself upon trial a Year ; the 
Wages to be fixed at the end of it. He gave me to 
understand however that at the Lancashire Works he 
reed, three hundred guineas a year and some small per- 
quisites; and added that compensations were very 
much governed, by the prices of necessaries, & the 
expence of living. 

I told him that I would write by this day's post, and 
by that of Thursday of next week, such an answer 
might be received, as to enable him to decide upon the 
eligibility of his waiting upon the Directors for further 
explanations. 

I do not write formally otherwise I should have di- 
rected this letter to the board ; but as you can easily 
consult the members of it, it would be well to express 
their sence on the contents of it. Nor do I mean to 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 99 

give any opinion of my own on the subject ; as the Di- 
rectors know better than I do, in what train the affairs 
of the Company is, & what their wants are. All that 
I shall say is, that if Mr. Myers really understands all he 
professes, particularly that of Lock navigation, he will 
not be long without applications in abundance, espe- 
cially as the members of Congress are now assembling 
from all parts of the U. States. 

Whatever you chuse should be said to Mr. Myers, let 
it be comprised in a letter to me, or him, as you please, 
if to me I shall put it into his hands, that there may be 
no misunderstanding of the sentiments. Give my love 
to Fanny & the children & believe me to be

PHILADELPHIA, 2Sth. Deer. 1795. 

My dear Sir, 

Your several letters relative to the state of the ap- 
plications to the assemblies of Maryland & Virginia on 
the business of the Potomac Company, and the result 
thereof, have been duly received. 

The last dated the sist. I directed Mr. Dandridge 
to show to Mr, Myers (knowing the suspence in which 
he was held) and to add, that if upon the strength of 
the information therein, he inclined to visit the Direct- 
ors, I would give him a line of introduction. This com- 
munication produced the enclosed letter from him: 
but Mr. Dandridge having expressed no more, than he 
was directed to do, there is no commitment. 

I mention this because the letter of Mr. Myers seems 
to imply more; and as much depends upon the skill, 
industry & other qualifications of an Engineer, or per- 
son employed in such a work, that you may examine 
him critically yourselves ; for it is proper I should ob- 
serve, that I have no other knowledge of Mr. Myer's

some papers which he has shown, but which I had not 
leisure to examine correctly.

add, that we are all well & join in affectionate regards 
to you & yours.

Dear Sir , 

This letter will be handed to you by Capt. Myers, of 
whom I have made mention in a former letter. 

Being desirous of knowing whether the directors of 
the Potomac Company are disposed to employ him as 
an engineer & Superintendant of their lock navigation, 
and on what terms, he has resolved to wait on them for 
those purposes. 

The tes imonials of his skill as an Architect, and of 
his knowledge relative to Locks, &c. will I presume be 
presented to you- These with such further inquiries 
as prudence may induce you to make, will enable you 
to decide on your measures, and thereby place Capt. 
Myers on the ground of Certainty. With great esteem 
& regard I am dear sir

My dear Sir, 

On thursday last I reed your letter of (now in

OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 101 

The business relative to the arsenal at the mouth of 
Shenandoah, has been shamefully neglected: and 
(but under the rose I make the Observation) I fear with 
design; for I was continually reminding the officer 
whose duty it was to carry the measure into effect, of 
the improvident delay; and about a fortnight after 
finding the matter remained in Statu quo., I gave a 
peremptory order for the execution: And was informed 
since by the Gentleman, that he had written to you 
on the subject. How it comes to pass that you 
should be ignorant of this at the date of your letter, 
there being sufficient time for the receipt of the former, 
is somewhat mysterious. Allowances ought unques- 
tionably to be made for the multiplied duties of two 
offices, which were discharged by one person, but the 
footing of which this business stood, and my frequent 
enquiries into it ought to have produced more prompt- 
ness in the Execution. I hope no change in Price will 
force a Change of Place; And that the thing will go 
on as if no delay had hapned* 

I am very glad to find that the affairs of the poto- 
tnack Company, are in so promising a train, and wish 
Capt Myres* may prove an acquisition in the superin- 
tendance of them. 

I pray you to let me have a statement of my account 
with you; and for informing me precisely what Shares 
I hold in the Banks of Alexandria & Columbia. My 
love to Fanny & the Children And with very great 
esteem & regard I remain

No. 65. 

PHILADELPHIA, i^th. Mar. 1796. 

My dear Sir, 

Your letters of the 26th. Ulto. and 2<1 Instant, came 
safe to hand, after some delay. The first, with the Will 
of Harper, has been put into the hands of the attorney 
Genl. to aid him in the conveyances. To such parts of 
the second as require it, I am about to reply ; first ex- 
pressing my satisfaction at the happy termination of 
the business which you undertook in behalf of the 
public. 

Having no doubt of the correctness of the account, 
which was transmited in the last mentioned letters ; I 
have only to beg that you would favor me with the 
numbers or other designation or description, of all 
the shares I now hold, in the Banks of Alexandria & 
Columbia, by your purchases, and to request if you 
wish to part with any of the twenty shares you pur- 
chased in the Potomac Navigation, that you would ap- 
propriate the balance due me, by your account, in as 
many as it will command; first paying up the Install- 
ment on the old ; called for I perceive to be paid on 
the first of the present month. If my present purposes 
and gratifications could be answered by prospects of 
future emolument, I would devote all the money I 
could command, to this Investiture ; but for the few 
Years I have to remain here, the enjoyment of less^ 
with ease & certainty, will be more convenient and 
desirable. 

If my resources were adequate to the purchase of the 
lots and houses which are offered for sale in Alexandria, 
I would gladly have been the purchaser of them on the 
terms mentioned in your letter of the 2d. Inst. but as 
these depend upon contingencies which may baffle cal- 
culation, I chuse to tread on sure ground in all my en- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 103 

gagements, being as unwilling to embarrass others by 
uncertain contracts, as I am to be deceived myself in 
my expectations from the assurances which I receive 
of promised paymt. 

From the enquiries which have already been made of 
you, relatively to my Farms at Mount Vernon, I take 
the liberty of enclosing you the terms, on which I mean 
to lease them. My expectation of disposing of them at 
the Rents therein mentioned, to such tenants as I 
should chuse, is not very sanguine; nor would I in- 
cline to do it to the slovenly farmers of this Country; 
if I had a tolerably well founded hope of getting them 
from any other, where husbandry is better understood, 
and more rationally practiced, the mentioning of which 
to some of your acquaintance, as you may chance to 
fall in with them (particularly the English & Scotch, 
the latter more especially) might be a means perhaps, 
of their suggesting it to others in the land they came 
from. 

It is not my intention, at least at the present mo- 
ment, to let the negroes go with the land, but if en- 
quiries on this head should be repeated, it might be 
useful to me to learn on what terms, these and the 
Lands conjointly, could be disposed of. Remember me 
kindly to Fanny & the children, and be assured of the 
Sincere friendship of Yr. Affecte. Servt.

104 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

A Mr. Summers of Alexandria is very desirous of 
ptirchasing my vacant lot in that Town ; and having 
been told that nothing short of a high price would in- 
duce me to sell it, makes the offer contained in the en- 
closed letters. Whether this offer is high or otherwise, 
depends upon comparison, the means of doing which is 
not within my reach, but thro* the medium of another, 
& therefore I give you the trouble of making some 
inquiry in the matter at any time when you are in 
Alexandria. I have no wish to part with the lot, un- 
less I can do it upon advantageous terms; and can 
dispose of the money in a more productive manner. 
I had thoughts of building on it, but this would be 
attended with trouble and perhaps a good deal of impo- 
sition, as it could not be properly attended to in the ex- 
ecution of the work. And besides workman's wages, 
and materials are very high at this time. 

A thought has run through my mind (since I began 
this letter) whether, as I have a prospect from the high 
price of flour, of raising five or six thousand dqllars 
from the same of it ; it might not be eEgable with that 
sum & the sale of the vacant lot (to Summers) to make 
the purchase suggested in one of your former letters 
to me? If that property is in an eligable place (and I 
wish to know where it lies) or whether or not if it would 
bring ten P. Cent on the purchase money, it would cer- 
tainly be more immediately advantageous to me than 
to let a part of the sum, necessary to command it, lay 
dead in a vacant lot, which when built on, would only 
be to let- Mr. Dandridge's ansr. to Mr* Summer's 
enclosed, is left open for your perusal and may be 
delivered to him or not, at any time you may find it 
convenient.

to close, & prepare for the mail, I hardly know what I 
have written, or whether you will be able fully to

MR TOBIAS LEAR, 

My Dear Sir, 

Your letters of the 2ist & 236. Inst have filled us 
with pain and anxiety; from, which probably, we shall 
not be relieved before tuesday; tho' we shall hope on 
that day to hear that both Fanny, and Maria are much 
better, if not entirely recovered. 

Upon receipt of the first of the letters above men- 
tioned, I made immediate enquiry in what train the 
business respecting the Arsenal on Potomack was in, 
and have since been informed by the (present) secre- 
tary of War, that he has written to you on the subject. 
I wish sincerely that the sickness in your family, had 
not prevented your journey to this City, & that it may 
not retard it much longer as the Departments at this 
juncture are so full of business as to require more 
attention, and urging in particular matters than the 
pressure of my own allows me to bestow. 

When you come we will make room for you to lodge 
in some manner or other, as the only spare room we 
have will I expect be occupied by Young Fayette & his 
Tutor. 

I wish devoutly, in which Mrs. Washington cor- 
dially unites, that this letter may find Fanny & Maria 
perfectly restored. My best regards to them & with 
affection 

I am always Yours

PHILADELPHIA, 3oth. March 1796. 
My dear Sir, 

Your former letters prepared us for the stroke, which 
that of the 25th. lust, announced, but it has fallen 
heavily notwithstanding. 

It is the nature of humanity to mourn for the loss of 
our friends, and the more we loved them the more 
poignant is our grief. It is part of the precepts of reli- 
gion & Philosophy, to consider the dispensations of 
Providence as wise, immutable, uncontroulable; of 
course that it is our duty to submit with as little 
repining as the sensibility of our natures is capable, to 
all its decrees. But nature will, notwithstanding, 
endulge for a while its sorrows. 

To say how much we loved & esteemed our departed 
friend is unnecessary. She is now no more! but she 
must be happy, because her virtue has a claim to it. 

As you talked of coming to this place on business let 
us press you to do so. The same Room that serves Mr. 
Dandridge & Washington is large enough to receive a 
bed also for you; and it is needless to add we shall be 
glad of your Company. The change may be service- 
able to you, and if our wishes were of any avail, they 
would induce you to make your stay here, as long as 
your convenience would permit.

ever shall remain, Your Sincere and

Yesterday's Post brought me the letters which had 
arrived in the Commerce, Capt. Tuttell; enclosing In- 
voice and Bill of lading for the long expected Seeds 
(which by the by have cost me at least four times as 
much as I expected. 

The Invoice and Bill of lading are now sent to you 
lest from the want of them, any difficulty or delay 
should arise, on the account of the duties, and they are 
accompanied with an earnest request that the packages 
may be forwarded to Mr. Pearce with as little delay as 
possible, the season for sowing the Peas & Succory be- 
ing already far advanced. The winter vetch cannot 
be sown before autumn. 

If you incline to try some of these seeds at your farm,

Your letter of the 3oth. Ulto, was received yesterday. 
As I expect (nothing new and unforeseen happening to 
prevent it) to commence my jotirney, for Mount Ver- 
non in ten or twelve days, I shall enter into no details 
respecting the matters touched upon in your letter of 
the above date. 

The chief design of my writing to you by this post 
is to inform you that your good mother and lovely son 
arrived in this City on Tuesday morning; and left 
it yesterday about ten o'clock, on their way to the 
Federal City. Mrs. Lear is very well and Lincoln as

ing you here. It was with great difficulty a carriage 
could be procured to take her on ; for it so happened 
that Congress closed their Session yesterday that the 
members were strugling for, & bidding on each other 
for conveyances and your mother's anxious desire to 
get to you, would not permit her to wait. At length 
after some unavailing attempts, Mr. Craik succeeded 
in getting a carriage & pair of horses, which I hope 
will take her safely down. 

I will send sugar & some other things from hence. 
We are all well as usual & join in best wishes for you. 
With sincere Esteem, & regard

A Mr. Prescott attends Mrs. Lear & Lincoln and 
it is not unlikely as the weather is cool, but that they 
may be with you as soon as this letter, as the Post does 
not travel on Sunday. I did not know untill after the 
Post had left the City on Wednesday, that Mrs. Lear 
was in it, or expected, or you should have been advised 
of the circumstances by the mail of that day.

My dear Sir, 

I hardly know what apology to make for the positive 
manner in which I declared the Certificate for the hun- 
dred Shares in the Bank of Columbia, had never been 
in my hands. The fact is otherwise, and I delay no 
time to correct any error. 

I found it last night and account for it thus. Given 
to me, I suppose, (for I have not the most obscure rec- 
ollection of the circumstance) at a time when my 
mind was occupied on, or immediately called to, some 



no LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

other subject, I put it loose in my traveling Chaise-box, 
where papers (frequently wanted at Mount Vernon) 
always remained, intending I presume to file it with the 
other Certificates, in the same box; but not doing it 
then, and forgetting to do it afterwards, as also of every 
recollection of having seen it, it might have remained 
there till dooms-day undiscovered, if I had not, for an- 
other purpose, examined every paper therein, separately 
and by that means found the Certificate which has puz- 
zled both you and me to know what had become of it- 

Mr* Dandridge (as I presume he has informed you) 
applied without encouragement to the Revd. Mr.Medor 
of this City (one of the Moravian clergy) for the speedy 
admission of Maria into the School for Young ladies at 
Bethlehem. Since then I have written to the principal 
of that School, the Revd. Mr. Van Vleck, but have not 
received his answer. When it comes I will forward it 
to you. 

Mr. Smith of Alexandria to whom my flour was sold, 
is craving earnestly a prolongation of payment, ninety 
days. This I do not like for two reasons i because 
it carries along with it distrust of his circumstances ; 
and 2 because the doing of it would be inconvenient, 
and a derangement of my own measures. I have how- 
ever not wanting to distress him, placed the matter 
upon the following ground. Pay Mr. Pearce the aggre- 
gate of his estimate of the sums necessary to pay his 
own wages; the overseers; & other incidental ex- 
pences of the estate on or before the 2 4th, of next 
month, & I will wait until the first day of March next 
for the balance provided he can and will give 
indubitable surety that both these shall be done. 

As Mr. Pearce may not be well acquainted with 
business of this sort, or indeed with the adequacy of 
the security which may be offered personal or real I 
have taken the liberty of mentioning the matter to 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON in 

you praying, if you should go down to your farm, that 
you would aid him with your advice. 

Washington Custis has got settled at Princeton Col- 
lege, and I think under favorable auspices; but the 
change from his former habits is so great & sudden, and 
his hours for study so much encreased, beyond what 
he has been accustomed to, that though he promises 
to be attentive, it is easy to be perceived, he is not at all 
reconciled to it yet. That of getting up an hour before 
day to commence them, is, I will venture to pronounce, 
not the least irksome to him at present. 

Offer my respects to Mrs. Lear & love to the children, 
in which Mrs. Washington unites. And be assured of 
the sincere esteem & regard of

My dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 2oth. Inst. was reed, yesterday, 
and the principal design of this is to cover the Copy of 
a letter from Mr. Van Vleck to me, respecting the re- 
ception of Maria at the School for young ladies in 
Bethlehem. It will be necessary for you to fix (for I 
presume it will be necessary that Mr. Van Vleck 
should know) precisely when she will enter ; for as he is 
pressed by others, and receiving Maria may be con- 
sidered as a favour (at this time) I would wish the 
matter to be regulated with punctuality. 

As you and Mr. Pearce both seem to think that the 
security offered by Alexander Smith is, under present 
appearances good, I will not now ask for any other, 
but as it may be in your way to discover, without much 
inquiry or trouble, how matters work in Alexandria be- 
fore March, I would thank you for advice if in your

judgment it should become expedient for me to resort 
to further means for the security of the sum which will 
be due me at that time from him. 

I am sorry to hear your Crop of Wheat turned 
out so indifferently mine I expect will be, proportion- 
tely no better. But all these things only serve as 
evidences to convince me, that if we were to reduce 
our cultivation, or rather grounds, to half the present 
quantity, and manure and till that half well, that our 
profits would be greater; while the other half would 
be improving. But this is a subject too copious for

Immediately upon the receipt of your letter of the

to Maria, and the daughter of Colo. Ball, to Mr. Van 
Vleck; with a request that he would answer the queries 
which were propounded therein under a cover to me. 
Enclosed is his answer and of course you will inform 
Colo. Ball thereof. 

As I know that many unsuccessful applications had 
been made for admission into the young ladies' school 
at Bethlehem about the time I wrote to Mr. Van Vleck, 
the reception of Maria & her cousin must be considered 
as a particular favor, and Col. Ball should make a 
point of it, to be exact in complying with the requisi- 
tions, that are enumerated in the Director's letter.

According to Doctr. Edwards' acct. Fulton's system is

MR TOBIAS LEAR, 

My dear Sir, 

It is nearlyif not quite a month since I enclosed you 
a letter from the Revd Mr Van Vleck, agreeing to 
take Colo Balls daughter along with Maria. 

In that letter he mentioned his terms; his wishes 
to know their exact ages; and informed you what 
necessaries they ought to come provided with. To 
these I added that knowing many unsuccessful attempts 
had been made, to get girls admitted to that School the 
reception of Maria & her cousin, ought to be considered 
as a favor ; and hoped that Colo Ball would be pointed 
in complying with the terms & requisitions. I requested 
too that you would write Mr Van Vleck (I think I 
added under cover to me) the precise time the Girls

were to enter. Since then I have heard nothing from 
you on this subject. 

That letter was accompanied wth Fultons Treatise

which I meant to deposit in your hands until my re- 
turn to Mount Vernon. No acknowledgement of 
this neither, leads me to apprehend a miscarriage of 
them & is the cause of these details* 

Another subject indeed has stimulated the present 
address. I have been asked with a degree of solici- 
tude from the War office to what cause is to be ascribed 
the non execution, or not coming forward of the Deed 
for the Land on which the arsenal on Shanandoah 
is to be erected, as these were promised in a letter 
from you dated early in August; since which noth- 
ing has been communicated; and is embarrassing to 
that Department ; as the necessary Items & information 
cannot accompany the Accounts of it in the manner 
that is expected ; On many accounts I hope this mat- 
ter will come forward without delay and particularly 
for the reasons I have mentioned. 

With sincere esteem & regard 

I am your affectionate

My dear Sir, 

Thus far we have arrived safe, but found it disagree- 
ably cold. 

To give the greater surety to the large looking 
Glasses, and such other articles as are liable to be in- 
jured by the jolting of a dray ; be so good as to have 
taken down by hand, and stowed where they will not 
be trod on; or tossed about in the Vessel's hold. 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 115 

The grate (from Mr. Morris's) pray have packed 
first in some of the old Carpeting to keep it from scratch- 
ing. The bedstead which Nelly Custis slept on belongs 
(Mrs. Washington says) to me. Let this and the 
trundle under it be sent in the Vessel. 

I question whether enough of the small hooks were 
got; desire Mr. Dandridge to get a couple of dozen 
more, like the two he took out of my Room yesterday, 
and he was to have got me small awls, but I believe cjlid 
not do it. I wish it to be done. 

Mr, Hill told me he had done something (but what 
I do not recollect) with the livery clothes ; I pray you 
to enquire and know they are sent around. 

Mr. Slough of Lancaster had 600 dollars sent him to 
buy Horses: 160 of which was expended. The bal- 
ance after deducting incidental expences I expected to 
have reed, before I left Philadelphia; but did not, and 
forgot to mention it. 

The newly published Pamphlets, pray purchase, and 
bring with you for me ; Mr, Dandridge knows what I 
already have. Desire Peter Porcupine's Gazette to 
be sent to me (as a Subscriber). 

If there be means left after I have fairly and honor- 
able discharged all the claims upon myself let Mr. Dan- 
dridge (if he should have occasion for it) have to the a- 
mount of 200 or two hundred & fifty Dollars, to provide 
such necessaries as he may require for his voyage to be 
returned when convenient to him. 

When the point at which the Vessel can sail is ascer- 
tained; advise me of it by letter. I wish you & all 
with you, every thing you wish yourselves and am 
Sincerely & Affectionately 

Yrs.

HEAD OF ELK loth, of March 1797 

My dear Sir, 

We arrived at this place to dinner and shall remain 
all night. To morrow we shall proceed but slowly. 

As I have missed the Post of this afternoon, and an- 
other does not happen until Monday it is probable this 
letter will not reach your hands in time. If the case 
however should be otherwise, and you have means to 
accomplish it, let me request you to provide for me as 
usual new Carpeting as will cover the floor of my blue 
Parlour. That it may accord with the furniture it 
ought to have a good deal of blue in it ; and if Wilton 
is not much dearer than Scotch Carpeting I would 
prefer the former. All the old Carpeting (belonging to 
me) I would have sent; and Mrs. Washington re- 
quests that you would add the Bellows and the Vessels 
(Iron & Tin) in which the ashes are carried out. If 
two pair of new Bellows were added to the old, (and of 
a better kind) it would be desirable. 

I pray you to desire Mr. Kitt to make all the en- 
quiry he can after Hercules, and send him round in the 
Vessel if he can be discovered & apprehended. 

I am always & Affectionately Yrs. 

P. S. 

The parlour is about 18 foot Square a suitable 
border if to be had, should accompany the Carpeting. 
Pray get me of those Thermometers that tells the state 
of the Mercury within the 24 hours Doctor Priestly 
or Mr. Madison can tell where it is to be had. Per- 
haps the old one if no thing better, may do to present to

BALTIMORE, i2th. Mar. 1797. 

My dear Sir, 

As I ride on matters occur to me and I shall take the 
chance of mentioning them to you before you may have 
left Philadelphia. A boat was bespoke, but no direc- 
tion given either for the payment or mode of getting it 
romnd. My credit is at stake as it respects the first, 
and my interest as it regards the second, and I shall be 
obliged to you for seeing how both can be promoted. 

It is incumbent on me also to pay rent up to the 
time the house is surrendered, and to see that it is 
made clean and delivered up in good order. I have 
several times mentioned this to Mr. Dandridge and 
pressed it upon Mr. Kitt; & trust it will be done. 
The furniture belonging to the public ought to have 
been well cleaned, as well as the Rooms before they 
were turned over to the President's order, with the 
Papers. 

Let me request the favour of you to purchase for me 
half a dozen pair of the best kind of White Silk stock- 
ings (not those with gores but) to be large, and with 
small clocks (I think they are called) I want the same 
number of raw silk, for boot stockings; large and 
strong. 

In my last from Elkton I mentioned the want of a 
Carpet for my parlour at Mount Vernon; and ob- 
served that as the furniture was blue, the ground or 
principal flowers in it ought to be blue also ; & that if 
Wilton Carpeting was not much dearer than Scotch 
I should prefer it. Mrs. Washington says there is a 
kind different from both much in use (Russia) if not 
dearer or but little more so than the former I would

have it got. The Room is about 18 feet Square, and 
the Carpet should have a suitable border if to be had. 
This letter may get to your hands on Tuesday morning 
and on the Post of Wednesday a line or two inform- 
ing when the goods will be on board, & the Vessel will 
sail, will be very agreeable to

MOUNT VERNON 25th. Mar. 17971 

My dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 2oth. Inst. with the Bill of lading 
for the Goods in the Sloop Salem, and another letter 
of the i $th. are both received; and I hope this will 
find you safely arrived in the Federal City. 

I have got painters at work in order to prepare my 
rooms for the furniture which is expected but I find I 
have begun at the wrong end, for some joiner's work 
(of the deficiency of which I was ignorant before it was 
examined) ought to have preceded theirs as the fixing 
of the chimney pieces ought also to do. The first I 
have engaged, but cannot on enquiry find that a Skilful 
hand is to be had in Alexandria to execute the latter* 
I would thank you therefore for engaging one, if to be 
had, in the Federal City or George Town, to be here on 
Monday or Tuesday at farthest, as my work will be at a 
stand without. To prevent imposition & to avoid dis- 
putes, I would prefer employing the artisan by the day. 
The work immediately foreseen and which must be done 
without delay, is to refix the marble Chimney piece in 
the parlour, which is almost falling out, to fix the new 
one (expected from Philadelphia) in the small dining 
Room; to remove the one now there, into what is called 
the School room, to fix the grate which is coming

round in the large dining room; and to give some re- 
pairs to the steps ; which (like most things else I have 
looked into since I have been at home) are sadly out of 
repair. 

Tis possible either of the Commissioners or Capt. 
Hoben could point out a proper Character, as they have 
had to do with the best workmen ; and 'tis possible, but 
I do not think it very probable, that Cornelius (my old 
servant) might be competent to do it. Two things 
however are necessary viz skill & dispatch. Our 
best regards are presented to all with you, and I am 
your Sincere friend & Affecte. Servant 
P. S. 

If Cornelius had knowledge in practice or theory 
sufficient for the job, I should be disposed to give him 
a preference ; first, because I am acquainted with his 
temper and industry; and sdly. because I foresee 
many other things, in his line, that must be done as 
fast as I can accomplish them ; by engaging a workman 
upon moderate terms, make Bricks or raise stone & 
procure lime. 

The Winds have been favorable for Capt. Elkins but 
we see no thing of his Sloop yet. As soon as it arrives 
I will let you know, as it would be very pleasing to me 
to have you here at that time*

MOUNT VERNON nth. Septr. 1797. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 8th. inst. was given to me yes- 
terday by Mr. John Bassett. 

If you had intimated a wish to Lease my River farm, 
a month or two ago, all matters might have been with 
ease arranged before this ; but as I had heard nothing 
in that time from the English farmer who had been in 
Treaty for it, I had relinquished the idea of letting it 
next year; & in consequence have engaged Stuart, 
Sown the principal part of my winter grain, and made 
all the necessary dispositions for the ensuing Season. 
I do not therefore, at this moment, see how they can be 
dispenced with. If upon further reflection on the sub- 
ject, and a consultation with Mr, Anderson, the meas- 
ure can be gone into, without involving difficulties, 
which cannot be easily surmounted, you shall hear fur- 
ther from me on this subject and learn more minutely 
the^details of my Plan, and the conditions on which 
the farm will be let ; for these will be specific, and 
exacted from the Tenant whomsoever he may be. 

If that Farm is not rented next year, there is nearly 
a moral certainty (if I am alive) it will be so the Year 
after; my object being to reduce my income to a cer- 
tainty; and to get relieved in my latter years (if I have 
any to pass) of the trouble and perplexities incident to 
such an estate as mine is, from the constitution of it.

Although nothing (except the Rent P. Acre) is def-

these respects, I enclose you a printed advertisement 
of them; published near two years since; my thoughts 
upon the subject at that period; and Mr, Anderson's 
sketch of a lease, when application was made for River 
farm, by the person before alluded to ; that you may 
gather, from thence the outlines of my views and in- 
tention; and more particularly, that you might not be 
under a mistake with regard to the Fisheries (which 
has always been -considered as distinct objects al- 
though they might be united in the same lease) the 
Stipes of old field without the present fences ; and the 
wood land; not an acre of which will be suffered to be 
cleared, for the purpose of cultivation (the swamps 
and Pocosons on the Creek and River excepted) nor a 
stick carried off the premises for any purpose whatso- 
ever; nor used thereon except in the manner, and 
for the purposes which are mentioned in one or more of 
the enclosed papers.

Monday next being the day fixed on by the Con-

stitution of the Potomac Company for their Annual 
meeting, and as you seem resolved to relinquish your 
present office as President, I wish you would turn 
your thoughts attentively to the situation of it, and 
revolve seriously on characters fit, and proper to supply 
the places, of those who perhaps ought to, as well as 
those who will quit the Directorship; that our struggles 
in that interesting and expencive concern the labour 
of years, may not end in disgrace & loss* 

The little leisure I had before my late appointment 
(from visits, my necessary rides- & other occurren- 
cies) to overhaul, arrange & separate papers of real, 
from those of little or no value, is now, by that event, 
so much encroached upon by personal & written ap- 
plications for Offices, & other matters incidental to the 
situation of the Commander in Chief, that without as- 
sistance I must abandon all idea of accomplishing this 
necessary work before I embark in new scenes, which 
will render them more voluminous, & of course more 
difficult, a measure which would be extremely irk- 
some to me to submit to, especially as it respects my 
accts. which are yet in a jumble my earnest wish 
and desire being when I quit the stage of human action, 
to leave all matters in such a situation, as to give as 
little trouble as possible to those who will have the 
management of them thereafter. 

Under this view of my situtation, which is far from 
being an agreeable one; and at times fills me with 
deep concern when I perceive so little prospect of 
complete extrication I have written to the Secretary 
of War to be informed whether (as my taking the field 
is contingent, & no pay or emolument will accrue to 
myself untill then) I am at liberty to appoint my Sec-

A TRUE COPY, MADE AT MRS. LEAR'S 

REQUEST, FROM THE DIARY 

OF COL. LEAR: 

Saturday, Deer* 14$!. 1799- 

This day being marked by an event which will be 
memorable in the History of America, and perhaps of 
the World, I shall give a particular statement of it, to 
which I was an eye witness 



The last illness and death of 
General Washington 



On Thursday Deer. i2th* the General rode out to his 
farms about ten o'clock, and did not return home till 
past three. Soon after he went out the weather be- 
came very bad, rain, hail, and snow falling alternately 
with a cold wind: When he came in, I carried some 
letters to him to frank, intending to send them to the 
Post-0 Sice in the evening. He franked the letters; 
but said the Weather was too bad to send a servant to 
the Office that evening. I observed to him that I was 
afraid he had got wet ; he said no f his great Coat had 
kept him dry; but his neck appeared to be wet, and the 
snow was hanging upon his hair. He came to dinner 
(which had been Waiting for him) without changing 
his dress. In the evening he appeared as well as usual. 

A heavy fall of snow took place on Friday (which 
prevented the General from riding out as usual. He 
had taken cold (undoubtedly from being so much ex- 
posed the day before) and complained of a sore throat: 
he however went out in the afternoon into the ground 
between the House and the River to mark some trees 



i 3 o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

which were to be cut down in the improvement of that 
spot. He had a Hoarseness which increased in the eve- 
ning; but he made light of it. In the evening the Pa- 
pers were brought from the Post Office, and he sat in the 
Parlour, with Mrs. Washington & myself reading them 
till about nine o'clock when Mrs. W. went up into 
Mrs. Lewis's room, who was confined in Child Bed, and 
left the General & myself reading the papers. He was 
very cheerful and when he met with anything interest- 
Ing or entertaining, he wd. read it aloud as well a*s his 
hoarseness would permit him. He requested me to 
read rto him the debates of the Virginia Assembly on 
the election of a Senator and a Governor ; and on hear- 
ing Mr. Madison's observations respecting Mr. Monroe, 
he appeared much affected and spoke with some de- 
gree of asperity on the subject, which I endeavoured to 
moderate, as I always did on such occasions. On his 
retiring I observed to him that he had better take some- 
thing to remove his cold. He answered no; " you 
"know I never take any thing for a cold. Let it 
"go as it came." 

Between two & three o'clock on Saturday morning, 
he awoke Mrs. Washington, and told her he was very 
unwell, and had had an ague. She observed that he 
could scarcely speak and breathed with difficulty; and 
would have got up to call a Servant ; but he would not 
permit her lest she should take cold. As soon as the 
day appeared, the Woman (Caroline) went into the 
Room to make a fire, and Mrs. Washington sent her im- 
mediately to call me. I got up, put on my clothes as 
quickly as possible, and went to his Chamber. Mrs. 
Washington was then up, and related to me his being 
taken ill as before stated. I found the General breath* 
ing with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a word in- 
telligibly. He desired that Mr. Rawlins (one of tife 
overseers) might be sent for to bleed him before the 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 131 

Dr. could arrive. I dispatched a servant instantly for 
Rawlins, and another for Dr. Craik, and returned again 
to the General's Chamber, where I found him in the 
same situation as I had left him. A mixture of Mo- 
lasses, Vinegar & butter was prepared to try its effects 
in the throat ; but he could not swallow a drop* When- 
ever he attempted it he appeared to be distressed, con- 
vulsed and almost suffocated. Rawlins came in soon 
after sun rise, and prepared to bleed him. When the 
arm was ready the General observing that Rawlins 
appeared to be agitated, said, as well as he could speak 
"Don't be afraid.' 9 And after the incision was made, 
he observed, "The orifice is not large enough." How- 
ever the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs. Washington 
not knowing whether bleeding was proper or not in the 
General's situation, begged that much might not be 
taken from him, lest it should be injurious, and desired 
me to stop it ; but when I was about to untie the string 
the General put up his hand to prevent it, and as soon 
as he could speak, said "More, more." Mrs. Wash- 
ington being still very uneasy lest too much blood 
should be taken, it was stopped after taking about half 
a pint. Finding that no relief was obtained from bleed- 
ing, and that nothing would go down the throat, I pro- 
posed bathing it externally with salvolatila, which was 
done; and in the operation, which was with the hand, 
and in the gentlest manner, he observed " tis very sore* " 
A piece of flannel dip'd in salvolatila was put around 
his neck, and his feet bathed in warm water; but 
without affording any relief. 

In the mean time, before Dr. Craik arrived Mrs* 
Washington desired me to send for Dr. Brown of Post 
Tobacco, whom Dr. Craik had recommended to be 
called, if any case should ever occur that was seriously 
alarming. I dispatched a messenger (Cyrus) immedi- 
ately for Dr, Brown (between 8 & 9 o'clock). Dr. 



i 3 2 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Craik came in soon after, and upon examining the Gen- 
eral, he put a blister of Cantharides on the throat, took 
some more blood from Mm, and had a gargle of Vinegar 
& sage tea, and ordered some Vinegar and hot water 
for him to inhale the steam which he did ; but in at- 
tempting to use the gargle he was almost suffocated. 
When the gargle came from his throat some phlegm 
followed it, and he attempted to Cough, which the Doc- 
tor encouraged him to do as much as possible ; but he 
could only attempt it. About eleven o'clock Dr. 
Craik requested that Dr. Dick might be sent for, as he 
feared Dr. Brown would not come in time. A messen- 
ger was accordingly dispatched for him* About this 
time the General was bled again. No effect however 
was produced by it, and he remained in the same state, 
unable to swallow anything. A blister was adminis- 
tered about 12 o'clock, which produced an evacuation; 
but caused no alteration in his complaint. 

Dr. Dick came in about 3 o'clock, and Dr. Brown ar- 
rived soon after. Upon Dr. Dick's seeing the General 
and consulting a few minutes with Dr. Craik he was 
bled again ; the blood came very slow, was thick, and 
did not produce any symptoms of fainting. Dr. 
Brown came into the chamber soon after; and upon 
feeling the General's pulse &c. the Physicians went out 
together. Dr. Craik returned soon after. The General 
could now swallow a little. Calomel & tarter em. were 
administered, but without any effect. 

About half past 4 o'clock he desired me to call Mrs. 
Washington to his bed side, when he requested her to 
go down into his room, and take from his desk two Wills 
which she would find there, and bring them to him, 
which she 'did. Upon looking at them he gave her one, 
which he observed was useless, as being superseded by 
the other, and desired her to burn it, which she did, and 
took the other and put it into her Closet- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 133 

After this was done, I returned to his bed side, and 
took his hand. He said to me, "7 find I am going, my 
breath can not last long. I believed front the first that the 
disorder would prove fatal. Do you arrange and record 
all my late military letters and papers. Arrange my 
accounts and settle my books, as you know more about them 
than any one else, and let Mr. Rawlins finish recording 
my other letters which he has begun." I told him this 
should be done. He then asked if I recollected any- 
thing which it was essential for him. to do, as he had 
-but a very short time to continue among us. I told 
him I could recollect nothing; but that I hoped he 
was not so near his end ; he observed smiling, that he 
certainly was, and that as it was the debt that all 
must pay, he looked to the event with perfect resigna- 
tion. 

In the course of the afternoon he appeared to be in 
great pain and distress, from the difficulty of breathing, 
and frequently changed his position in the bed. On 
these occasions I lay upon the bed, and endeavoured to 
raise him, and turn him with as much care as possible. 
He appeared penetrated with gratitude for my atten- 
tions, & often said, I am afraid I shall fatigue you too 
much, and upon my assuring him that I could feel noth- 
ing but a wish to give him ease, he replied, " Well it is 
a debt we must pay to each other, and I hope when you 
want aid of this kind you will find it*" 

He asked when Mr. Lewis & Washington Custis 
would return, (they were in New Kent) I told him 
about the soth. of the month. 

. About 5 o'clock Dr. Craik came again into the room 
& upon going to the bed side the Genl. said to him, 
Doctor, I die hard; but 7 am not afraid to go; I believed 
from my first attack that I should not survive it; my 
breath can not last long. 

The Doctor pressed Ms hand, but could not utter a 



i 3 4 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

word. He retired from the bed side, & sat by the fire 
absorbed in grief. 

Between 5 & 6 o'clk Dr. Dick & Dr. Brown came 
into the room, and with Dr. Craik went to the bed; 
when Dr. Craik asked him if he could sit up in the bed? 
He held out his hand & I raised him up ." He then said 
to the Physicians, '*! feel myself going, I thankyou for 
"your attentions; but I pray you to take no more 
"trouble about me, let me go off quietly, I can not last 
"long." They found that all whichhad beendonewas 
without effect; he laid down again and all retired ex- 
cept Dr. Craik. He continued in the same situation, 
uneasy & restless, but without complaining; fre- 
quently asking what hottr it was. When I helped him 
to move at this time he did not speak, but looked at me 
with strong expressions of gratitude. 

About 8 o'clock the Physicians came again into the 
room and applied blisters and cataplasms of wheat 
bran to his legs and feet ; after which they went out 
(except Dr. Craik) without a ray of hope. I went out 
about this time and wrote a line to Mr. Law & Mr* 
Peter, requesting them to come with their wives (Mrs. 
Washington's Granddaughters) as soon as possible to 
Mt Vernon. 

About ten o'clk he made several attempts to speak 
to me before he could effect it, at length he said, 
"J am just going* Haw me decently buried; and do 
not let my body be put into the Vault in less than three 
days after I am dead. " I bowed assent, for I could not 
speak. He then looked at me again and said," Do you 
understand me? I replied "Yes." " Tis well" said he. 

About ten minutes before he expired (which was be- 
tween ten & eleven o 'elk) his breathing became easier ; 
he lay quietly; he withdrew his hand from mine, and 
felt his own pulse. I saw his countenance change. I 
spoke to Dr. Craik who sat by the fire; he came to 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 135 

the bed side. The General's hand fell from his wrist 
I took it in mine and put it into my bosom, Dr .Craik 
put his hands over his eyes and he expired without a 
struggle or a sigh! 

While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs . Washington 
(who was sitting at the foot of the bed) asked with a 
firm & collected voice, Is he gone? I could not 
speak, but held up my hand as a signal that he was no 
more. J Tis well, said she in the same voice, " All is 
now over I shall soon follow him! I have no more trials 
to pass through!" 



OCCURRENCES NOT NOTED IN THE PRECEDING 
NARRATIVE. 

The General's servant Christopher was in the room 
through the day ; and in the afternoon the General di- 
rected him to sit down, as he had been standing almost 
the whole day; he did so. 

About 8 o'clock in the morning he expressed a de- 
sire to get up. His clothes were put on and he was 
led to a chair by the fire. He found no relief from this 
position, and lay down again about 10 o'clk. About 
5 P. M. he was helped up again & after sitting about 
half an hour desired to be undressed & put in bed; 
which was done. 

During his whole illness he spoke but seldom, and 
with great difficulty; and in so low & broken a voice 
as at times hardly to be understood. His patience, 
fortitude, & resignation never forsook htm for a mo- 
meat. Lx all his distress he uttered not a sigh, nor a 



136 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

complaint; always endeavouring (from a sense of 
duty as it appeared) to take what was offered Mm, and 
to do as he was desired by the Physicians. 

At the time of his decease Dr. Craik and myself were 
in the situation before mentioned; Mrs. Washington 
was sitting near the foot of the bed, Christopher was 
standing by the bedside. Caroline Molly & Charlotte 
were in the room standing near the door. Mrs. 
Forbes the House keeper, was frequently in the room 
during the day and evening. 

As soon as Dr. Craik could speak after the distress- 
ing scene was closed, he desired one of the servants to 
ask the Gentln. below to come upstairs. When they 
came to the bedside ; I kissed the cold hand which I 
had held to my bosom; laid it down, & went to the 
other end of the room; where I was for some time lost 
in profound grief; until aroused by Christopher de- 
siring me to take care of the General's keys and other 
things which were taken out of his pockets ; and which 
Mrs. Washington directed him to give to me: I 
wrapped them in the General's handkerchief, & took 
them with me to my room. 

About 12 o'clk the Corpse was brought down stairs, 
and laid out in the large room. 



Sunday Deer. i5th, 1800. 

The above statement so far as I can recollect is 
correct, 

JAS. CRAIK. 



Sunday Deer. i5th. 1799. 

Fair Weather. 

Mrs. Washington sent for me in the Morning and de- 
sired I would send up to Alxa. and have a Coffin made : 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 137 

which I did. Doctor Dick measured the body, the 
dimensions of which were as follows 

In length 6 feet 3^ inchs. exact. 
Across the shoulders i " 9 " " 

Across the elbows 2 " " 

After breakfast I gave Dr. Dick & Dr. Brown forty 
dollars each, which sum Dr. Craik advised as very 
proper; and they left us after breakfast. 

I wrote letters to the following persons informing 
them of the late melancholy event. 

The President of the United States 
General Hamilton 
Genl. Pinckney 
Bushrod Washington 
Col. W. A. Washington 
Lawrence Lewis 
G. W. P. Custis 
Geo. S. Washington 
Saml. Washington 
Colo. Ball 

Capt. Hammond also to 

John Lewis, desiring him to inform his Brothers, 
George, Robert & Howells. 

The letters were sent by the following conveyances 

To the President, Genl. Hamilton, & John Lewis by 
the Mail. 

To Col. W. A. Washington, to & Bushrod Washing- 
ton by express to Colo. Blackburn, requesting him to 
forward them by the same conveyance. 

To L. Lewis, & G. W. P. Custis by express. To Gen- 
eral Pinckney, Col. Ball, Saml. Washington, G. S. 
Washington, & Capt. Hammond, by my own servant 
Charles, with my riding horse. 



i 3 8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Mrs. Stuart was sent for in the Morning. About 10 
o'clk, Mr. Thos. Peter came down; and about two, 
Mr. and Mrs. Law to whom I had written on Saturday 
Eveng. Dr. Thornton came down with Mr. Law. Dr. 
Craik tarried all day & all night. 

In the evening I consulted with Mr. Law, Mr. Peter 
& Dr. Craik on fixing a day for depositing the Body in 
the Vault. I wished the ceremony to be postponed 
until the last of the week, to give time to some of the 
General's relations to be here: But Dr. Craik & Dr. 
Thornton gave it decidedly as their opinion, that con- 
sidering the disorder of which the General died, being 
of an inflamatory nature, it would not be proper, 
nor perhaps safe, to keep the body so long; and there- 
fore Wednesday was fixed upon for the funeral, to 
allow a day (Thursday) in case the weather should be 
unfavorable on Wednesday. 

Monday, Deer. i6th. 1799- 

I directed the people to open the family Vault, clean 
away the rubbish from about it, and make everything 
decent. Ordered a door to be made to the Vault, in- 
stead of closing it again with brick, as had been the cus- 
tom. Engaged Mr. Inglis and Mr. McMunn to have a 
Mahogany Coffin made, lined with lead, in which the 
body was to be deposited. 

Dr. Craik, Mr. Peter, & Dr. Thornton left us after 
breakfast. Mrs. Stuart & her daughters came in the 
afternoon. Mr. Anderson went to Abca. to get a num- 
ber of things preparatory for the funeral. Motirng. was 
ordered for the Family Domestics and Overseers. 

Having received information from Alexa. that the 
Militia, Freemasons &c. were determined to show their 
respect to the General's Memory by attending his body 
to the Grave, I directed provision to be prepared for a 
large number of people, as some refreshment would be 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 139 

expected by them. Mr. Robert Hamilton wrote me 
a letter informing that a Schooner of Ms wd. be off 
Mount Vernon to fire Minute guns when the body was 
carrying to the grave. Gave notice of the time fixed 
for the funeral to the following persons by Mrs. Wash- 
ington's desire, viz Mr. Mason & family Mr. Peake 
& family Mr. Nickols & family Mr. McCarty & fam- 
ily Miss McCarty Mr. & Mrs. McClanahan Lord 
Fairfax & family Mr. Triplet & family Mr. Anderson 
& family Mr. Diggs, Mr. Cockburn & family Mr. 
Massey & family Mr. R. West. I wrote also to the 
Revd. Mr. Davis, to read the service. 



Tuesday Deer. i?th. 1799. 

Every preparation for the mournful ceremony was 
making. Mr. Diggs came here in the forenoon. Also 
Mr. Stewart, Adjutant to the Alexa. Regimt. to view 
the ground for the procession. 

About one o'clock the Coffin was brought from Alexa. 
in a stage. Mr. Ingle & Mr. McMurin accompanied it. 
Also Mr. Grater with a shroud. The Body was laid 
in the Coffin at which time I cut off some of the hair* 

The Mahogany Coffin was lined with lead, soddered 
at the joints and a cover of lead to be soddered on 
after the body should be in the Vault. The whole was 
put into a case lined & covered with black Cloth. 

Wednesday Deer. i8th. 1799. 

About eleven o'dk numbers of people began to as- 
semble to attend the funeral, which was intended to 
have been at twelve, but as a great part of the Troop 
expected could not get down in time, it did not take 
place till three. 

Eleven pieces of Artillery were brot. from Alexa. and 



140 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

a Schooner belonging to Mr. R. Hamilton came down 
& lay off Mt- Vernon to fire Minute guns. 

About 3 o'clock the procession began to move. The 
arrangements of the procession were made by Colonels 
Little, Simms & Deneale, and Dr. Dick. The Pall 
holders were Colonels Little, Simms, Payne, Gilpin, 
Ramsey and Marsteler. Coll. Blackburn preceded 
the Corpse. Coll- Deneale marched with the Military. 
The procession moved out of the Gate at the left Wing 
of the House, and proceeded round in front of the lawn, 
& down to the Vault on the right wing of the House*

speech. 

The Masons performed their ceremonies, & the Body 
was deposited in the Vault. 1111 

After the Ceremony the Company returned to the 
house where they took some refreshment, & retired 
in good order. The remains of the provisions were 
distributed among the blacks. 

Mr. Peter, Dr. Craik & Dr. Thornton tarried here all 
night. 

When the Ceremony was over I retired to my room 
(leaving to Mr. Law & Mr. Diggs the care of the Com- 
pany) to give a loose to those feelings which I had been 
able to keep under control, while I found it necessary 
for me to give a personal attention to the preparations 
for interring the body of my deceased friend. 

What those feelings were is not to be told, if it were 
even possible to describe 1

I this day sent to Alexa. for the Plumber to come 
down & close the leaden Coffin containing the General's 
Body, as Judge Washington had arrived, and did not 
incline to see the remains. The Plumbers came. I 
went with them to the Tomb I took a last look a 
last farewell of that face, which still appeared unal- 
tered. I attended the Closing of the Coffin and be- 
held for the last time that face wh. shall be seen no 
more here; but wh. I hope to meet in Heaven.

MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS REVEALING 

THE GREAT STATESMAN'S MODE OF 

LIFE AT MT. VERNON 

PHILADELPHIA, Jane soth., 1792. 
Sir, 

I little expected that I should have had occasion, at 
this time (after the pointed assurances you gave me 
more than three years ago, of discharging what was 
due to me, fully) to remind you that I have received 
only Three hundred and eighty pds. of the balance; 
and to ask what I am to expect from you in the future.- 

I delayed from day to day while you were in this 
City (tintil it was too late) to apply to you on this sub- 
ject, in hope, of an expectation that you would not 
have left town without mentioning it yourself. 

Before I apply to the Executors of Colonels Tayloe & 
Thornton who were securities for the money loaned to 
your deceased father, John Mercer Esqr. I will await 
the receipt of your answer to the letter which I hope 
will be given as soon as you can make it convenient. 

It has been of little avail hitherto, to inform you of 
the causes of my want of this money, although in more 
instances than one, I have done it with .the utmost 
truth and candour; should I say anything further to 
you on this head now, were I not in a manner compelled 
to declare that from an occurrence which did not exist 
before have a call upon me, for a considerable sum, in a 
few months; against which it is indispensably neces- 
sary that I should be provided. 
I am Sir 

Your Most Obedt. Servant 

G. WASHINGTON". 
To JOHN FRANCIS MERCER. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 143 

PHILADELPHIA, Augt. 26th, 1793. 
Sir, 

I intended to have written to you somewhat sooner, 
but business of a public nature and pressing, prevented 
it until now. 

Although I have conviction in my own mind, that a 
hundred guineas pr. annum is more than my Mount 
Vernon Estate will. enable me to give the Superintend- 
ent of it ; yet, the satisfaction (when one is at a consider- 
able distance from property they possess, under circum- 
stances which does not allow much thought thereon) 
of having a person in whom confidence can be placed 
as a manager, is such, as to dispose me to allow you that 
sum; provided other matters can be adjusted to the 
mutual convenience, and satisfaction of both parties. 

As you were about to depart in the Stage when I saw 
you (and which I knew could not wait) I did not go so 
much into detail as was necessary to place an agreement 
upon a basis to avoid mis-conception, and unpleasant 
disputes thereafter; and besides altho' you would be 
upon standing wages, which in the opinion of some 
would make it immaterial (these'bfcing paid) what sort 
of an estate you overlooked ; yet my opinion of a sensi- 
ble and a discreet man is, that before he would finally 
engage he would view the estate himself, and decide 
from that view, whether it possessed such advantages 
as would enable him to acquire honour as well as profit 
from the management thereof; whether he could 
make it profitable to his Employer from its local situa- 
tion ; the plans proposed; or the condition in which 
it might appear to him. Whether the part of the 
Country, the accomodations, the water, &ct, were to 
his liking; with other considerations which will admit 
no evidence equal to that of one's own observation, to 
decide ultimately on what to resolve. 

Having stated a fact, and given my ideas of what I 



144 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

suppose would be most agreeable for you to do, I shall 
add, that if nothing more than I foresee at present 
should happen, I expect to be at Mount Vernon about 
the 2oth. of next month, for a stay of 8 or 10 days. If 
then you are disposed to undertake rny business, and 
wish to see the nature of it, and the present state of it ; 
I should be glad to see you there about that time, when 
every necessary arrangement may be made if we should 
finally agree. 

From Baltimore to Mount Vernon by the way of the 
Federal City, George Town, and Alexandria, is 59 
measured Miles : and from Annapolis to the same 
place, crossing Potomac at Alexandria, is 45 Miles; 
but it might be reduced to less than 40 if there was a 
ferry opposite to my house. Prom Baltimore to Alex- 
andria (through the above places) the regular Stages 
pass; and set out every Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday from the former, reaching the latter the same 
day; from whence a horse could be hired without 
difficulty, I believe, to carry you to my house, distant 
9 miles. I mention these things for your information, 
in case you should determine to go there. 

If you resolve to meet me at Mount Vernon, give me 
notice thereof immediately; and if business or any 
other cause should render it impracticable for me to be 
there, at the time, I will inform you, soas to prevent 
your setting out. 

I informed you at our meeting, that I had eight or 
ten Negro Carpenters under the care of a worthless 
White man, whom I had forborn to turn away on ac- 
count of the peculiar circumstances attending his 
family. But I suffer so much from his negligence ; 
By his bad qualities; and bad examples; that I find 
it indispensably necessary to get some other workman 
to supply his place. If it should be your lot to superin- 
tend my affairs, your own ease, as well as my interest, 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 145 

would induce you to look out for a successor to him, 
against New Years day ; if not, and you could recom- 
mend a proper character for this business, it would be 
rendering me an acceptable service to do it. I am Sir 
Your Hble. Servt. 

Go. WASHINGTON. 
MR. WILLIAM PEARCE. 

MOUNT VERNON, Octr. 6th. 1793 
Mr. Pearce, 

Enclosed is a copy of our agreement with my signa- 
ture to it. 

Since you were here, Mrs. Washington the Widow of 
my Nephew, who formerly lived at this place, has re- 
solved as soon as we leave it, to remove to her Brother's 
in the lower part of this State, and will not, I believe, 
return to reside at it again. This will make it more 
convenient and agreeable, both for yourself and me, 
that you should live the Winter, at least, at my Mansion 
house ; as it will allow more time for my carpenters to 
provide for Mr. Crow, and to put the place he lives at in 
better repair than it now is for yourself, if there should 
be occasion for you to go there ; and this too, under your 
own inspection. 

The right wing to my dwelling house as you possibly 
may have noticed, and heard called the Hall (being 
kept altogether for the use of Strangers) has two good 
rooms below (with tiled floors) and as many above, 
all with fixe places. This will accomodate your family 
(being a larger house) better than Crow's ; and by being 
here, you will have the use of my Kitchen, the Cook 
belonging thereto, Frank the House Servant, a boy also 
in the House. The Stable, Garden, &ct., &ct., without 
any additional expense to me at the same time that 
it will, by placing you in the centre of the business, 
ease you of much trouble; for otherwise, the frequent 



r 4 6 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

calls for Tools, Nails, Iron, &ct., from the Store and 
the particular attention which matters abt. the Mansion 
house will require, would have occasioned you many 
an inconvenient ride here, the necessity for which will 
be entirely superceded, as your mornings and evenings 
will, of course, be spent where your presence will be 
most wanting. 

As I am never sparing (with proper aeconomy) in 
furnishing my Farms with any, and every kind of Tool 
and Implement that is calculated to do good and neat 
work, I not only authorize you to bring the kind of 
ploughs you were speaking to me about, but any 
others, the utility of which you have proved from your 
own experience. particularly a kind of hand rake 
which Mr. Stuart tells me are used on the Eastern Shore 
of Maryland in lieu of Hoes for Corn at a certain state 
of its growth and a Scythe and Cradle different from 
those used with us, and with which the grain is laid 
much better. In short I shall begrudge no reasonable 
expense that will contribute to the improvement and 
neatness of my Farms ; for nothing pleases me better 
than to see them in good order, and everything trim, 
handsome, and thriving about them; nor nothing 
hurts me more than to find them otherwise, and the 
tools and implements laying wherever they were last 
used, exposed to injuries from Rain, sun, &ct. 

I hope you wiE endeavor to arrange your own con- 
cerns in such a manner as to be here as much before the 
time agreed on as you conveniently can. Great ad- 
vantages to me will result from this, by putting the 
business in a good train before the Fall operations are 
closed by the frosts of Winter, and all improvements 
are thereby at an end for that season. On the other 
hand, inconveniences to yourself may arise from delay 
on account of the Weather Navigation, &ct ; there 
having been instances of this River's closing with Ice 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 147 

several days before Christmas which might prevent the 
removal of yr things in time. That your living at the 
Mansion may be attended with no more expence to you 
than if you had gone to the other place (at which Crow 
now lives) on account of Gentlemen, who now and 
then call here out of curiosity as they are passing 
through the Country I shall lay in such things as 
will be necessary for this purpose, and the occasions 
(which are but rare) may require. 

I expect to leave this place about the 2 8th. of the 
Month for Philadelphia, or the neighborhood of it; any 
letter therefore which shall arrive before that time will 
find me here afterwards it will go to Philadelphia 
where it had better be directed. 

I am your friend and Servant 

Go. WASHINGTON. 
MR. WILLIAM PEARCE. 

MOUNT VERNON 27th. Oct. 1793 
Mr. Pearce, 

Your letter of the ipth came duly to hand. To- 
morrow I leave this for Philadelpa or the vicinity of 
it ; where, when you have occasion to write to me, di- 
rect your letters. 

As you seemed to be in doubt whether a proper 
character could be engaged in ye part of the Country 
you live in, to look after my Negro Carpenters; and 
(having much work to do in their way, and not being 
willing to leave matters at an uncertainty ) I have en- 
gaged the person who superintends them at present 
to look after them another year. He is a good work- 
man himself, and can be active ; but has little authority 
(I ought to have said command, for I have given him 
full authority) over those who are entrusted to him 
and he is fond of drink, tho* somewhat reformed in 
this respect, I place no great confidence in him. He 



i 4 8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

has, however, promised so to conduct himself, as that 
there shall be no cause for complaint I thought it 
was better, therefore, to engage him, than to run any 
hazard. I have engaged no person to look after the 
house People, Ditchers &ct in place of the one now 
occupied in that business ; and unless a very active and 
spirited man could be had, it will scarcely be essential 
while you reside at the Mansion house yourself. The 
old Man that is employed in this business is, I believe, 
honest, sober, well meaning, and in some things know- 
ing; but he wants activity and spirit; and from not 
being accustomed to Negros, in addition thereto; they 
are under no sort of awe of him of course do as they 
please. His wages are low, Twenty pounds pr ann, 
on jy tinder this statement of the case you may do as 
shall seem best to yourself. If he is to go, he ought to 
know it seasonably: his time is up at Christmas; 
and nothing betwn us has past either as to his going, 
or staying. 

I shall, before you remove, or by the time you may 
arrive at Mount Vernon f give you full directions, and 
my ideas upon the several points which may, between 
this and then, occur to me. In all things else you 
must pursue your own judgment having the great 
outlines of my business laid before you. 

After having lived the ensuing Winter at the Mansion 
house you will be better able to decide than at the 
present moment, how far your convenience, my interest, 
and indeed circumstances, may render your removal to 
the other place more eligable. I shall readily agree to 
either. Materials are now providing for building a 
house for Mr. Crow; whose house it was first proposed 
you should live in, for him to remove to. There are a 
great number of Negro children at the Quarters be* 
longing to the house people ; but they ha ve Always been 
forbid (except two or 3 young ones belonging to the

Cook, and the Mulatto fellow Frank in the house, her 
husband; both of whom live in the Kitchen) from 
coming within the Gates of the Inclosures of the Yards, 
Gardens &ct; that they may not be breaking the 
Shrubs, and doing other mischief; but I believe that 
they are often there notwithstanding: but if they 
could be broke of the practice it would be very agree- 
able to me, as they have no business within; having 
their wood, Water, &ct at their own doors without. 

The season has been remarkably sickly, generally, 
but my family, except a few slight touches of the 
intermittent fever chiefly among the blacks have 
shared less of it, than I find from report, has been felt 
in most other places. 

I am Your friend &ct 

Go. WASHINGTON. 
MR. WILLIAM PEARCE 

GERMAN TOWN, 24^ Novr. 1793 
Mr. Pearce, 

On my way to this place (about the last of Octr.) 
I lodged a letter for you in the Post Office at Baltimore, 
which I hope got safe to your hands, although I have 
not heard from you since. 

I shall begin, now, to throw upon Paper such general 
thoughts, and directions, as may be necessary for 
your government when you get to Mount Vernon ; and 
for fear of accidents, if transmitted to you thro" any 
other channel, will deposit them in the hands of my 
Nephew, Mr. Howell Lewis, who will remain (though 
inconvenient to me) at that place until your arrival 
there; that he may put you in possession, and give 
you such information into matters as may be useful. 

As my farms stand much in need of manure, and 
it is difficult to raise a sufficiency of it on them; and 
the Land besides requires something to loosen and 



j S o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

ameliorate it, I mean to go largely (as you will perceive 
by what I shall hand to you through Mr. Lewis) upon 
Buck Wheat as a Green manure (Plowed in, when full 
in blossom) for this purpose I have requested a 
Gentleman of my acquaintance, in the County of 
Loudoun, about Mount Vernon, to send to my place 
in time 450, or 500 bushels of this article for seed. 
And as I do not wish to go largely upon Corn, it is 
necessary I should sow a good many Oats; my 
calculation (allowing two bushels to the Acre) is about 
400 bushels wanting. Not more than the half of 
which can I calculate I have of my own, for Seed next 
Spring, and therefore if you could carry round with 
you two hundred, or even 300 bushels to be certain; 
of those which are good in quality, and free from 
Onions, I will readily pay for them and the accustomed 
freight. That I may know whether to depend upon 
yr doing this, or not, write me word; that in case of 
failure with you, I may try to obtain them through 
some other channel. 

I am your Friend and Servant 

Go. WASHINGTON. 
MR. WILLIAM PEARCE 

PHILADELPHIA i8t Decemr 1793* 
Mr. Pearce, 

The paper enclosed with this letter will give you my 
ideas, generally, of the course of Crops I wish to pursue. 
I am sensible more might be made from the farms 
for a year or two but my object is to recover the 
fields from the exhausted state into which they have 
fallen, by oppressive crops, and to restore them (if 
possible by any means in my power) to health and 
vigour. But two ways will enable me to accomplish 
this. The first is to cover them with as much manure 
as possible (winter and summer) . The 26. a judicious 
succession of Crops. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON" 151 

Manure can not be had in the abundance the fields 
require; for this reason, and to open the land which 
is hard bound by frequent cultivation and want of 
proper dressings, I have introduced Buck Wheat in 
the plentiful manner you will perceive by the Table, 
both as a manure, and as a substitute for Indian Corn 
for horses &ct; it being a great ameliorator of the soil. 
How far the insufferable conduct of my Overseers, 
or the difficulty of getting Buck Wheat and Oats for 
seed, will enable me to carry my plan into effect, I am 
unable at this moment to decide. You possibly, will 
be better able to inform me sometime hence. Colo. 
Ball of Leesburgh has promised to use his endeavours 
to procure and send the first to Mount Vemon; but 
where to get as much of the latter as will answer 
my purposes (unless I send them from this city) I 
know not; but before I can decide on the quantity 
it may be necessary for me to purchase, it is essential 
I should know the quantity grown on my own estate; 
and which after I went to Virginia in September last 
I directed should no longer be fed away, The common 
Oats which are brought from the Eastern Shore to 
Alexandria for sale, I would not sow first, because 
they are not of a good quality and 2dly because 
they are rarely, if ever, free from Garlick and wild 
Onions: with which, unfortunately, many of my 
fields are already but too plentifully stocked from 
the source already mentioned; and that too before I 
was aware of the evil. 

I have already said that the insufferable conduct 
of my Overseers may be one mean of frustrating my 
plan for the next year. I will now explain myself. 
You will readily perceive by the rotation of Crops I 
have adopted, that a great deal of PaH plowing is 
indispensable. Of this I informed every one of them, 
and pointed out the fields which were to be plowed at 



i52 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

this season, So anxious was I, that this work should 
be set about early, that I made an attempt soon after 
you were at Mount Vernon in September, to begin it ; 
and at several times afterwards repeated the operation 
in different fields at Dogue-mn farm ; but the ground 
being excessively hard and dry, I found that to per- 
severe would only destroy my horses without effecting 
the object in the manner it ought to be, and therefore 
I quit it; but left positive directions that it should 
recommence at every farm as soon as ever there should 
come rain to moysten the earth and to stick con- 
stantly at it, except when the horses were employed 
in treading out Wheat (which was a work I also 
desired might be accomplished as soon as possible). 
Instead of doing either of these, as I ordered, I find 
by the reports, that McKoy has, now and then, plowed 
a few days only as if it were for amusement. That 
Stuart has but just begun to do it. And that neither 
Crow nor Davy ad Muddy-hole had put a plow into 
the ground so late as the yth. of this month. Can it 
be expected then, that frosts, Snow and Rain will 
permit me to do much of this kind of work before 
March or April? When Corn planting, Oats sowing, 
and Buck Wht for manure, ought to be going into the 
grd, in a well prepared state, instead of having it to 
flush up at that season and when a good deal of 
Wheat is to be got out with the same horses. Crow 
having got out none of his that was stacked in the 
field, nor Stuart and McKoy much of theirs, which 
is in the same predicament; the excuse being, as 
far as it is communicated to me, that their whole 
time and force since the month of October has been 
employed in securing their Corn When God knows 
how little enough of that article will be made. 

I am the more particular on this head for two reasons 
first to let yon see how little dependence there is 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 153 

on such men when left to themselves (for under Mr. 
Lewis it was very little better) and 2dly to show 
you the necessity of keeping these Overseers strictly 
to their duty that is to keep them from running 
about, and to oblige them to remain constantly with 
their people ; and moreover, to see at what time they 
turn out of a morning for I have strong suspicions 
that this, with some of them, is at a late hour, the 
consequence of which to the Negroes is not difficult 
to foretell. All these Overseers as you will perceive 
by their agreements, which I herewith send, are on 
standing wages ; and this with men who are not actu- 
ated by the principles of honor or honesty, and not 
very regardful of their characters, leads naturally 
to endulgences as their profits, whatever may be 
mine, are the same whether they are at a horse race 
or on the farm whether they are entertaining company 
(which I believe is too much the case) in Jheir own 
houses, or are in the field with the Negroes. 

. Having given you these ideas, I shall now add, that 
if you find any one of them inattentive to the duties 
which by the articles of agreement they are bound to 
perform, or such others as may be reasonably en- 
joined, Admonish them in a calm, but firm manner 
of the consequences. If this proves ineffectual, 
discharge them, at any season of the year without 
scruple or hesitation, and do not pay them a copper; 
putting the non-compliance with their agreemt in 
bar. 

To treat them civilly is no more than what all men 
are entitled to, but, my advice to you is, to keep them 
at a proper distance; for they will grow upon famil- 
iarity, in proportion as you will sink in authority, 
if you do not. Pass by no faults or neglects (especially 
at first) for overlooking one only serves to generate 
another, and it is more. than probable that some of 



j 5 4 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

them (one in particular) will try, at first, what lengths 
he may go. A steady and firm conduct, with an 
inquisitive inspection into, and a proper arrangement 
of everything on yotir part, will though it may give, 
trouble at first, save a great deal in the end and you 
may rest assured that in everything that is just, and 
proper to be done ib your part, (you) shall meet with 
the fullest support ib mine. Nothing will contribute 
more to effect these desirable purposes than a good 
example unhappily this was not set (from what I 
have learnt lately) by Mr. Whiting, who, it is said, 
drank freely kept bad company in my house m 
Alexandria and was a very debauched person 
wherever this is the case it is not easy for a man to 
throw the first stone for fear of having it returned to 
Mm; and this I take to be the true cause why Mr. 
Whiting did not look more scrupulously into the 
conduct of the Overseers, and more minutely into the 
smaller matters belonging to the Farms which, 
though individually (they) may be trifling, are not 
fotuid so in the agregate ; for there is 'no addage more 
true than an old Scotch one, that "many rnicHes 
make a mucHe. " 

I have had but little opportunity of forming a 
correct opinion of my white Overseers, but such 
observations as I have made I will give. 

Stuart appears to me to understand the business 
of a farm very well, and seems attentive to it. He is 
I believe a sober man, and according to his own ac- 
count a very honest one. As I never found him (at 
the hours I usually visited the farm) absent from 
some part or another of his people, I presume he is 
industrious and seldom from home. He is talkative, 
has a high opinion of his own skill and management 
and seems to live in peace and harmony with the 
Negros who are confided to his care, He speaks 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 155 

extremely well of them, and I have never heard 
any complaint of him. His work however, has been 
behind hand all the year, owing he says, and as I 
believe, to his having too much plowing to do and 
the last omission, of not plowing when he knew my 
motives for wishing it, has been extremely repren- 
sible. But upon the whole, if he stirs early, and works 
late, I have no other fault to find than the one I have 
just mentioned His talkativeness and vanity may 
be humoured. 

Crow is an active man, and not deficient in judgment 
If kept strictly to his duty would, in many respects, 
make a good Overseer. But I am much mistaken in 
his character, if he is not fond of visiting, and receiving 
visits. This, of course, withdraws his attention from 
his business, and leaves his people too much to them- 
selves; which produces idleness, or slight work on one 
side, and flogging on the other the last of which be- 
sides the dissatisfaction which it creates, has, in one 
or two instances been productive of serious conse- 
quences I am not clear either, that he gives due 
attention to his Plow horses and other stock which 
is necessary, although he is very fond of riding the 
former not only to Alexandria &ct but about the 
farm, which I did not forbid as his house was very 
inconvenient to the scene of his business. 

McKoy appears to me to be a sickly, slothful and 
stupid fellow. He had many more hands than were 
necessary merely for his Crop, and though not 70 acres 
of Corn to cultivate, did nothing else. In short to 
level a little dirt that was taken out of the meadow 
ditch below his house seems to have composed the 
principal part of his Fall work; altho T no finer season 
could have happened for preparing the second lot o 
the Mill swamp for the purpose of laying it to grass. 
If more exertion does not appear in him when he gets? 



156 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

into better health he will be found an unfit person to 
overlook so important a farm, especially as I have my 
doubts also of his care and attention to the horses &ct- 

As to Butler, you will soon be a judge whether he 
will be of use to you or not. He may mean well, and 
for ought I know to the contrary may, in some things 
have judgment; but I am persuaded he has no more 
authority over the Negros he is placed, than an old 
woman would have; and is as unable to get a proper 
day's Work done by them as she would, unless led to 
it by their own inclination wch I know is not the case. 

Davy at Muddy-hole carries on his business as well 
as the White Overseers, and with more quietness 
than any of them. With proper directions he will do 
very well; and probably give you less trouble than any 
of them, except in attending to his care of the stock, of 
which I fear he is negligent; as there are deaths too 
frequent among them. 

Thomas Green (Overlooker of the Carpenters) will, 
I am persuaded, require your closest attention, without 
which I believe it will be impossible to get any work 
done by my Negro Carpenters in the first place, be- 
cause, it has not been in my power, when I am away 
from home, to keep either Mm, or them in any settled 
work; but they will be flying from one trifling thing to 
another, with no other design, I believe, than to have 
the better oportunity to be idle, or to be employed on 
their own business and in the next place, because, 
although authority is given to him he is too much 
upon a level with the Negros to exert it; from which 
cause, if no other every one works, or not, as they please 
and carve out such jobs as they like. I had no 
doubt when I left home the 28th of Oct. but that 
the house intended for Crow wd have been nearly 
finished by this time, as in order to facilitate the ex- 
ecution I bought Scantling, Plank and Singles for 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 157 

the building: instead of this I do not perceive by his 
weekly report that a tool has yet been employed in it 
nor can I find out by the said report that the barn 
at Dogue-run is in much greater forwardness than when 
I left it. 

To correct the abuses which have crept into all parts 
of my business to arrange it properly, and to reduce 
things to system; will require, I am sensible, a good 
deal of time and your utmost exertions ; of the last, 
from the character you bear, I entertain no doubt; 
the other, I am willing to allow, because I had rather 
you should probe things to the bottom, whatever time 
it may require to do it, than to decide hastily upon the 
first view of them; as to establish good rules, and a 
regular system, is the life, and the soul of every kind 
of business.

Dear Sir, 

The enclosed came to my hands a few days ago the 
means are also enclosed to discharge Colo. Simm's ac- 
count, and to receive his requittal. I would thank you 
to get from and forward to me, Mr. Lee's charge also ; 
that my Administration of the Estate of Colo. Cblvill 
may be finally closed, and the balance deposited some- 
where for the benefit of the residuary legatees. 

That I may be better able to decide upon the latter 
point, I would thank you for an extract of that part of 
Colo. Thorns. Colvill's Will (or the Will itself, as I pre- 
sume it is no longer of any use to you) which makes 
this devise; and for all the claims, proofs, &ca. which 
have been handed to his Executors in consequence 
thereof, and which were deposited (to the best of my

PHILADELPHIA, Feby. sd., 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

In due course of the Post I have received your letters 
of the 1 7th of December and 2ist of the last month; 
and congrattdate you on the birth of a son and the 
passage of your family through the Small Pox. 

As you had acknowledged the receipt of the needful 
for purchasing the Buck Wt, and had assured me that 
no disappointment should follow, I have not given you 
the trouble of a lettter until now, since I wrote from 
German Town ; and now, principally to beg that the 
Buck Wheat be down in time for early sowing ; the 
present frost being favorable for transportation. 

I have procured for you, and it shall be sent with my 
own by the first vessel to Alexandria, three bushels of 
Clover seed which appears to be clean, and warranted 
fresh. It will cost delivered at Alexandria about eight 
dollars a bushel. It shall be directed to the care of 
Col. Gilpin to whom my own things will be consigned ; 
as the Capt. is not at liberty to send any part of his 
cargo before he arrives at the port to which he is bound. 
No opportunity has offered since the first frost (in 
December) set in, or both yours and mine would have 
gone e'er this. To say now where they will go is more 
than I am able as the Delaware is close, and navigation 
at an end until there comes a thaw. 

With this letter is enclosed a box containing brace-

lets etc. for Mrs. Ball wch I hope will get .safe to and, 
as I have directed them to the particular care of the 
Postmaster in Alexandria Mrs. Washington and the 
family join me in every good wish for you, Mrs. Ball 
and Miss Milly, if with you, and with affectionate re- 
gard 

I am, Sir 

Your obedient Servt. 

Go, WASHINGTON. 



As soon as you have ascertained the amount of cost 
and charges of the Buck Wheat delivered at Mt. Vern. 
let me know it and I will remit what may be due on the 
acct. The freight of the Clover seed from hence to 
Alexandria as well as the first cost of it will be paid 
here.

PHILADELPHIA, March ioth., 1794. 
Sir, 

In due course of Post I was favoured with your letter 
of the 2 5th of Jany, with the deed which it enclosed from 
Colo. Mercer & others, to me. This deed refers to a 
Survey of the Manor of Woodstock (in the year 1782) 
and to a division thereof made by HezeHah Veatch, 
assistant Surveyor of Montgomery County, on the 2d. 
day of January 1793. 

The latter (is the body of the deed) is said to be re- 
corded. It is essentially necessary indeed that it 
should be so. But neither the original, nor a copy 
thereof was forwarded to me, This induces me to give 
you the trouble of informing me whether the above 
Survey of Mr. Veatch is admitted to record, and, in 
that case, that you would be so good as to furnish me

Dear Sir, 

To the best of my recollection when you paid me for 
my flour of last year you asked the refusal of it this 
year. 

By the report from my men I perceive about 3,000 
bushels of wheat has been manufactured; but how 
much flour it has made and of what sort, I am yet to 
learn. If you incline to purchase what there is, let 
me know the best price you will give ; or to make the 
matter short, and to save time, you may have the 
Superfine (if any is made) and fine flour at what they 
sell for in this market with a deduction of the usual 
freight per barrel from Alexandria to the place. (*)

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the rst. inst. with its enclosures, I have 
duly received. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON i6r 

I shall, by this day's Post, write to the representative 
of Colo. Carlyle (agreeably to the suggestion in Mr. 
Chalmers letter) to know if he (Mr. Herbert) can throw 
any light upon the payment of 100 which Mr. 
Chalmers conceives he must have made on acct. of Mr. 
Sidney George's Bond. When I receive the answer it 
shall be forwarded to you. Till then the draught on 
Mr. Chalmers may be suspended. 

I have no other object in this business than to bring 
everything which relates to it to a speedy & equitable 
close as far as it respects the parties interested and to a 
justifiable one as it concerns myself. On these princi- 
pals I should hope Mr. George would not require (having 
an attested copy of it) the original bond in the possession 
of Mr. Chalmers especially as the receipt for the money 
might recite a statement of the fact, for his indemni- 
fication. 

It is of moment, however, to me, to have it ascer- 
tained whether the sum of 100 reed, by Mr. Chalmers 
& the sum due from Mr. George for the payment of ^90 
ought not to be discharged with interest. The Ad- 
ministration accts. which have been settled will show 
that interest has been paid by the estate of Colo. 
Collins (Miss Anderson is an instance of it) and judg- 
ments in behalf of the estate have been obtained, in 
Virginia, with interest. To act safely is all I aim at, 
for I neither gain nor lose by the transaction. 

I am Dear Sir 
Your Most Obedt. & Very Hble. Servant 

G. WASHINGTON.

PHILA., March 23d, 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

By a letter I have just received from my Manager 
Mr. Pearce dated the i8th inst I find he had received 



i6a LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

no more at that time, than 131 bushls. of the Buck 
Wheat you were to procure for me. I hope there will 
be no disappointment of the remainder. It would fall 
hard upon me, as I have not the quantity of seed oats 
necessary to carry my plan into effect this year; a 
failure of both would leave my grounds unoccupied. 
My love in which Mrs. Washington & the family unite 
is tendered to Mrs. Ball and yours. 
I am Dear Sir 

Your Affecte. 

Go. WASHINGTON. 
To COLO. BURGESS BALL. 

PHILADELPHIA, April 6th 1794. 
Mr. Pearce, 

Your letter and Reports of the ist. instant I have 
received, and am glad to find by the first that you have 
got your family safe to Mount Vernon; as, unquestion- 
ably, it will be a satisfaction to you to have them along 
with you. Change of air may, and I hope will, restore 
your eldest daughter to health again. 

I had no doubt but that the late capture of our 
Vessels by the British Cruisers, followed by the Em- 
bargo which has been laid on the Shipping in our 
Ports, wd naturally occasion a temporary fall in the 
article of provisions ; yet, as there are the same mouths 
to feed as before; as the demand, consequently, will be 
as great; and as the Crops in other parts of the world 
will not be increased by these means, I have no doubt 
at all, but that, as soon as the present impediments are 
removed the prices of flour will rise to what it has been 
(at least) for which reason hold mine up to the prices 
mentioned in my last; and if they are offered, make a 
provisory agreement, to be ratified, or not, by me; 
an answer to which can be obtained in a week. With 
respect to the Wheat on hand, you must (if you hear 
nothing to the contrary from me) be governed by tir-

cumstances and your own judgment, in getting it out 
of the straw; but, at any rate, remove it into the 
Barns for the purpose of threshing in weather when 
the people cannot work out. 

When salt, or any other article of which you are in 
want, gets to a high price, provide for the present oc- 
casion only unless there is a moral certainty of their 
rising still higher; in that case prudence would direct 
otherwise. 

It was not my expectation that either grass or grain 
could be rolled at the expence of stopping the Ploughs; 
consequently, if the Oxen were not in a condition for 
the accomplishment of this work the execution of it 
was not to be expected: but is not this an instance 
among a variety of others, of the impolicy of not 
breaking a great number of Steers at each of the 
Farms ? which would prevent the few that are broke from 
being reduced too low for the services thereof. 
Twenty Oxen are not more expensive than ten broke, 
and ten unbroke Steers, because you feed them as Oxen 
only when they are worked ; and unbroke Steers must be 
fed, as well as Oxen (though not in the same manner) 
at other times. By this means there never would be a 
want of draught Cattle for Cart, Harrow or Roller. 

How does the young grass which was sown in the 
new meadows last fall, and the Clover come on? Was 
the latter injured much by the Winter? 

Besides the number of Stacks which are yet in 
Wheat, I wanted to know what those stacks are sup- 
posed to contain; and this the Overseers, by com- 
paring the size of them with those which have been 
tread out, may certainly give a pretty near guess at. 

The three bushels and half of Oats, mentioned to 
you in my last, are not of such superior quality as I 
had been led to expect from the account given of them ; 
yet, notwithstanding, ground may be kept 



1 64 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

time longer for them, or until you hear further from 
me, on this head. 

The imposition with respect to the Garden seeds, is 
very unjustifiable; 'tis infinately worse than simple 
robbery, for there you loose your money only, but 
when it is given for bad seed you lose your money, 
your labour in preparing for the reception of them, 
and a whole season. 

Cloaths must be provided for the Young Gardener 
at Alexandria. Those for work to be stong, and 
substantial. Sunday, or Holliday Cloaths to be decent, 
and such as may please without going to more expence 
than is necessary : but of the latter class I should 
conceive he can be in no want now, unless he has made 
an improper use of a whole suit (of very good Cloaths) 
which were given to him the latter end of October 
last. 

I am sorry to find that my chance for Lambs this 
year, is so bad. It does not appear to me by the Re- 
ports that I shall have more than a third of what I 
had last year: what this can be ascribed to is beyond 
my comprehension, unless it be for want of Rams, or 
bad Rams. Let therefore, at Shearing time, a selection 
of the best formed, and otherwise promising ram 
lambs be set apart (in sufficient numbers) to breed 
from; and when they are fit for it, cut the old ones and 
turn them aside, to be disposed of. 

At Shearing time also, let there be a thorough culling 
out, of all the old, and indifferent sheep from the flocks 
that they may be disposed of, and thereby save me the 
mortification of hearing every week of their death! 
which is the more vexatious as I was taught to believe 
that every indifferent sheep was drawn for this pur- 
pose last Spring, notwithstanding the loss of them 
which has been sustained the past winter; and indeed 
unto the present moment.

When you next go to Alexandria take the exact 
dimensions of the rooms in my house at that place, 
that I may send paper for them. Give the length and 
breadth of each and height from the wash board to 
the Chair board (as they are commonly called) and 
thence to the Cornish, if any, with the doors and win- 
dows, and size of them, in each room or passage. If 
there is occasion to make good the plastering in any of 
the rooms, no white wash must be put thereon; be- 
cause it is improper for paper. Thomas Davis must 
paint the outsides of both houses there ; the lower part 
of a stone colour, and the roofs red. The Inside of the 
dwelling house is also to be painted. The whole in 
short is to be put in very good, and decent condition. 
If the planking between the two houses is plained, 
this also should be painted.

Dear Sir, 

I have been favored with your letter of the 4th inst. 
and thank you for the information respecting the dep- 
redations on my land, lying on four miles Run. Mr, 
Bushrod Washington a year or two ago was desired to 
commence a suit or suits against some of the Tres- 
passers but whether he did, or not, or what the result 
was, I do not recollect ever to have heard. The growth 
of the land, is more valuable than the land itself, to 
protect it therefore is important. 

Not knowing the Christian name of Mr. Minor, or 
whether there may not be more than one of that name, 
I am at a loss to direct to him ; and indeed for a safe 
mode of conveying a letter to him, and therefore take 
the liberty of putting the enclosed under Cover to you,,

with a request (after putting a wafer in it) that yon

The accounts which I receive from Mount Vernon, 
respecting my Wheat, are very unfavorable. They 
could not, indeed, he otherwise, after the effect, oc- 
casioned by drought in the fall had become apparent, 
which was the case before I left home in the latter part 
of October. 

The appointment of a Marshall, for the District of 
Georgia, had taken place before your letter came to my 
hands : but if the case had been otherwise Mr, McCrea, 
however well known in Virginia was too new a settler, 
and too little known in Georgia to have become an ac- 
ceptable man for that office, when half the State (in a 
manner) was in hot pursuit of it. & many of the 
ancient inhabitants & respectable characters were 
pressing forward by themselves, & friends, on this 
occasion. 

My best wishes attend Mrs. Stuart and the rest of the 
family, & with very great esteem & regard 
I am Dear Sir

Mr. Pearce, 

Your letter of the 2pth ulto, and the reports which 
were enclosed, came duly to hand. 

I am sorry to find by the first that the Ship Peggy 
had not then arrived at George Town, from London. 
I fear the White thorn Plants (5,000 in number) which I 
have on board, together with Mr. Lears fruit Trees, 
will suffer very much, if they are not entirely destroyed ; 
by the advanced season. Let the ground (wherever 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 167 

the first are to go) be prepared for their reception, that 
no time which can he avoided, may be lost in getting 
them into it; as to the latter, that is the fruit trees, 
there cannot be many of them, consequently no pre- 
vious preparation is necessary, for their deposit. 

I wish you had discharged Green without any cere- 
mony, when you found him drinking, and idling his 
time away; as to any reliance, on his promise to 
amend, there can be no sort of dependance : for it has 
been found that he is growing worse and worse: The 
consequence of which is, that he dare not find fatalt 
with those who are intrusted to his care, lest they shd 
retort, and disclose his rascally conduct; by which 
means work that the same number of hands would 
perform in a week, takes mine a month. Nothing 
but compasion for his helpless family, has hitherto 
induced me to keep him a moment in my service (so 
bad is the example he sets) ; but if he has no regard 
for them himself, it is not to be expected that I am to 
be a continual sufferer on this acct, for his misconduct. 

I never could get an account of the Corn made on 
my Estate last year, consequently can form no idea of 
the quantity now on hand, nor of the prospect there 
is of its carrying me through the year. At any rate, 
it should be used with great care, but if it is likely to 
run short, as much parsimony should be observed as 
can comport with the absolute calls for it, on the farms, 
as I know not where to get more; and should find it 
inconvenient to pay for it if I did. 

Does the first sown Btick "Wheat come up well? as 
fast as any field, or lot is planted with Potatoes, let 
the quantity which has been used therefor, be noted 
in the Farm Report of the place where they have been 
used. To plant the Potatoes whole is the best, where 
there is enottg^i of them; when there is not, cutting 
becomes necessary, and should then be adopted.

I have received, though really it has not been in my 
power yet to read, the Pamphlet (The Revolution in 
France, (?) N. Y. t 1794) you were so obliging as to send 
me. Your motives to writing it are highly laudable, 
and I sincerely wish they may meet the reward which 
is due to them. I pray you accept my thanks for the 
work, and to be assured that 

I am Sir 
Your most obed. Serv,

MR. NOAH WEBSTER, JUNR. 

PHILADELPHIA i7th May, 1795. 
Dear Sir: 

(Private) 

Your letter of the nth inst. came to hand by the 
Post of yesterday. 

With pleasure I received your acceptance of the 
office of commissioner of the federal city. The com- 
mission will be handed to you from the Department of 
State, and the sooner you can enter upon the duties of 
that trust, the more convenient and agreeable it will 
be. 

With the candor, which I am sure will be agreeable 
to you, I shall intimate (for reasons which I shall not 
at this time enumerate, but which will appear evident 
after you have been there awhile) that a residence in 
the city, if a house is to be had, will be more pro^ 
motive of its welfare than your abode in George Town. 
I shall add that the motives which induced a fixed 
salary (which the first commissioners did not receive) 
were that they should reside on the sort; that they 
were not only to plan and regulate the affairs of the 
city but to look to the execution of them also. To 



i 7 o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

accomplish which, with the greatest ease to themselves, 
and best advantage to the public, I presumed that 
after measures were decided on by the Board they 
would have been so arranged as that each member 
would have attended to the execution of a particular 
part; or if found more convenient, that in rotation, 
each would have superintended the whole. I could 
not perceive however, when I was in the city last (the 
only time since the change in the Board) that any such 
arrangement had been adopted. In short, the only 
difference I could perceive between the proceedings of the 
old and the new commission results from the following 
comparison, The old met not oftener than once a 
month except on particular occasions; the new meet 
once or twice a week. In the interval the old resided 
at their houses in the country; the new reside at 
their houses in George Town. The old had too much 
of the business done by daily wages, and were obliged 
to trust to overseers and superintendents to look to 
the execution; the new have gotten more into the 
execution of it by contracts, and piece work, but rely 
equally, I fear, on others to see to the performance. 
These changes (tho* for the better) by no means apply 
a radical cure to the evils that were complained of, 
nor will they justify the difference of compensation 
from six dollars per day for every day's attendance 
in the city and sixteen hundred per annum. 

My time will not permit me to go more into detail 
on this subject, nor is it necessary; your own good 
judgment will supply you with more that I could add. 
The year 1800 will be soon upon us; The necessity 
therefore of hurrying on the public buildings and 
other works of a public nature and executing of them 
with economy. The propriety of preventing idleness 
in those who have day or monthly wages, and im- 
position by others, who work by measure by the

piece or by contract and seeing that all contracts 
are Mfilled with good faith, are too obvious to be 
dwelt on, and are not less important than to form 
plans, and establish rules for conducting, and bringing 
to a speedy & happy conclusion this great and arduous 
business. With esteem and regard 
I am Dear Sir 
Your obed. Sevt.

ALEXANDER WHITE, Esq. 

PHILADELPHIA, i8th May, 1794. 
Dear Sir: 

Your letter of the 7th inst. came duly to hand, with 
the Rental enclosed. 

As there are no houses, or any thing standing on my 
lots in the Town & Common of Winchester, it is of no 
great moment what is done with them. I arn not dis- 
posed to sell them, nor to part with them, or lease for a 
long term, but if you could obtain an annual Rent for 
either, or both, without running me to any expense, it 
would, however small, be clear. With respect to my 
lots in Bath, some thing ought to be done with them* 
The Buildings there on, together with the lots, stand me 
in at least 200 : but whether common interest can be 
obtained in a Rent for them, you, who know the state 
of things in that quarter can judge better of than I am 
able to do. & therefore I leave it to you, to act for me 
as you would for yourself. If they were even let to 
some one who would keep the buildings in Repair it 
would be more desirable by far than, without a tenant, 
or some person to take care of them, to suffer them to 
fall to ruin. 

I do not know whether I clearly understand your 
proposition of an exchange of the Land in Potomac for 
a Lot in Berkeley County. The first contains 240 



172 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

acres instead of 140, as mentioned in your letter, 200 of 
which is rich River bottom, which must as the Naviga- 
tion of the River improves, become extremely valuable 
from the produce it is capable of, besides the fine black 
Walnuts which grow thereon, & would fetch a good 
sum at the Federal City; if others can be restrained 
from pilfering them. On the other hand, I know of no 
land I hold at the Mouth of Bullskin, nor any lease that 
*was ever given to a person of the name of Dimmett. 
No such name, I am pretty sure, is to be found in the 
original list of my Tenants, and equally sure I am no 
Leases have been given of late years (with my consent) 
for three lives. When you explain this matter more 
fully, it will be more in my power than it is at present 
to speak to you on this particular point. Speaking of 
Leases for lives, I am led to observe to you, that the 
lives will never decrease, nor the proof of the existence 
of those who were originally inserted. I do not recollect 
any instance of my changing names where the leases 
have been transferred, & but few of my consenting to 
transfers; which makes me more desirous of knowing 
how a Person of the name of Demmett (which I do not 
recollect at all) should be possessed of a lease for three 
lives. I hope Muse has not abused my confidence in 
putting blank leases into his hands signed in order 
to be filled up thereafter, by doing it improperly. 

Although I can very illy spare the money arising 
from the Rents you have collected ; yet, if the lots are 
susceptible of such augmentation in the annual income ; 
by purchasing in the leases as you think of, I consent to 
your applying the money in your hands to this purpose, 
in cases where there is a moral certainty of a consider- 
able increase of Rent; and that the purchases 'are 
made by the first of next November. You will ascer- 
tain precisely before you attempt these purchases 
jst what lives are certainly existing in them, & 2nd 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 173 

whether the Covenants in them have been complied 
with on the part of the Tenants, for in the first case I 
may be purchasing that which belongs to me of right, 
and in the second case, that which they have forfeited 
by a non-compliance with the conditions on which the 
leases were granted. You will recollect also, that by 
the terms of one, or most of the leases, the Tenant is 
not at liberty to sell to any one without my consent. 

I am sorry you should meet with any difficulty about 
the land I gave you, near the Accoceek old Iron Works. 
I am not possessed of any Papers belonging to it, nor 
is it in my power to point you to any Office where they 
are to be found ; but I should conceive that the tract is 
so well known that all the adjoining land holders are 
able to show you the bounds of it. There was one 
John Henry that knew it well and I believe Col: 
Charles Carter of Ludlow has some knowledge of it. I 
have been told, that some person in Palmouth (whose 
name I do not recollect) had pillaged the land of the 
most valuable Pines thereon; and that either he, or 
some other, talked of escheating it; but I never sup- 
posed injustice would prompt any one to such a 
measure. Perhaps this, or some such mode might be 
advisable for you, as the title Papers are not to be 
found ; nor the manner in which my Mother came by it 
to be traced with precision. By Will (I have under- 
stood) it was left to her by her father (Ball) but what 
his Christian Name was I am unable to tell you, nor the 
County he lived in with certainty but presume it was 
Lancaster. This Will seems to me to be the only clue 
by which the title can be traced ; the bequest, probably, 
may as usual contain some description of the Land. 

Your aunt & the family joins me in best regards for 
Mrs. Lewis. I am Dear Sir 

Your Sincere friend & Affe. uncle

Dear Sir, 

The letter of which the enclosed is a copy renders 
further explanation on my part in a manner unneces- 
sary I must beg leave notwithstanding to add that 
when mistakes happen the sooner they can be rectified 
the better. 

All I recollect of this matter (and that but imper- 
fectly) is, that Colo. Lewis (your father), purchased 
from a Michael Robinson for and on my account, the 
lots in Fredericksburg on which niy mother lived. 
Robinson (I believe) bought them of him, & no Deed 
having been made for them he, to avoid trouble & the 
expense of double transfers, conveyed them to me. 

If this was done by wrong numbers it is incumbent 
on you as heir at law, to correct this error and it (may 
seem) necessary that I should, for that same reason^ 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 175 

convey the lots m&ii3to the rightful owners of 
them.

matter thoroughly, & whatever is proper to be done on

Dear Sir, 

If in a letter, not long since written to you, you were 
authorized to rent the South tract of land I hold on 
Difficult Road, in Loudon County, I now desire that 
you will not do it I have had some overtures for the 
purchase of it; and have been offered five pounds an 
acre, giving credit, which I was willing to do, but the 
thing that parted us at that time, and may possibly do 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 177 

so for ever, was interest; he wanted credit without 
paying this to which I would not consent But as land 
thereabouts is rising fast in value, I have no doubts of 
obtaining the price & terms, & even more, by keeping 
it up, provided it is not incumbered with a Lease. 

I authorised you in my last, to lay out the money 
collected on my behalf for Rents due me, in purchas- 
ing in the Leases, but restricted this operation not to 
exceed (if I recollect rightly) the first of November. 
I now prolong it until the first of January (which closes 
the present year) beyond which you are not at liberty 
to apply money to this purpose, without further in- 
structions from me. 

You must be very particular in examining into the 
real State and condition of the Leases ; for if the ac- 
counts of the Tenants (without this enquiry) is to 
govern, the lives will never expire. It is essential also 
to know, if transfers have taken place, under what 
authority it has happened; as there is a clause, or 
covenant in the leases (if my memory serves me), re- 
straining this, without written permission of the Land- 
lord. And if it shall appear, by any of the leases, that 
an alteration of names, from the original instrument, 
has taken place, to learn, with precision, by what means 
it has taken place. I shall expect written evidence of 
these facts. A verbal explanation without, from the 
Tenants, will not satisfy me.

PHILADELPHIA, July 28th, 1794. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 2gth. ulto. came to my hands a 
few days ago only. 



J7 8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Mr. Samuel Jackson (if that is the name of the per- 
son who asked me sometime in the course of last winter 
if I would dispose of my land in Payette, & at what 
price) must very greatly have misunderstood my an- 
swer if he conceived thirty shillings an acre was the 
value I had set upon it, 

The truth is, that at no period since I dissolved my 
partnership with Simpson, & had any idea of parting 
with this, & my other land West of the Alligany Moun- 
tains, did I ever fix a less value than forty shillings pr. 
Acre on the tract you live. It is not to be presumed 
then that I should lower my price when it was increas- 
ing twenty five, fifty, and even an hundred pt. Ct in 
almost every direction. 

Mr. Jackson must have mistaken the tract in Wash- 
ington County for that in Payette, from the price; for 
thirty shillings pr. Acre was the value I put on that. 
The conversation I had with that Gentleman was very 
short ; for when I found he did not mean to be the pur- 
chaser himself, but was making enquiries merely to 
satisfy his own curiosity or to gratify that of others, I 
told him I had rated them at such & such prices, 40 /. 
I think for that in Fayette & ao/, for the others, & be- 
ing asked if I would allow any credit, he was 
answered yes; provided a certain part of the pur- 
chase was paid at the time of ensealing & delivery; 
and interest paid on the residue. But he was told at 
parting, that as nothing final had taken place between 
him & me, he was not to consider any thing that 
passed between us, as binding upon me at a future 
day. 

Mentioning this matter to a Gentleman well ac- 
quainted with the value, & prices of land in that 
Country he told me he thought the Land on wch. you 
live (the whole tract I mean) would fetch Six dollars 
an acre; accordingly Mr. Ross of Washington (one 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 179 

of your Senators) has been authorized to sell both tracts. 
Not knowing therefore what he may have done in this 
matter I can not be more precise with you, at this time. 
If the land is not already tinder engagement, and I do 
not believe it is, as it is but lately the power to dispose 
of is was given, it would give me plaesure that you shd. 
have the preference, if Mr. Ross and you can agree on 
the price. And if you would pay a fourth of the pur- 
chase down, you might have credit for the residue four, 
five, or even six years, giving the land, and your 
Bond bearing the rest, as Security

We removed to this place about twelve days ago to

I received your letter of the $th. instant, which came to 
my hands yesterday. 

The business of establishing Arsenals, and providing 
proper places for them, is within the Department of 
War ; the Secretary of which (General Knox) set out on 
Friday last for the Provence of Main, and will not be 
returned in less than six weeks. But as I am persuaded 
he has no idea (nor are there indeed funds provided 
equal thereto) of giving 25,000 Dollars for the Site of 
one, only, I would not have you, by any means, avoid 
sowing wheat, or doing any thing else which you might 
have had in contemplation to do, on Account of what 
I mentioned to you in my last, on this subject. 

What (under the rose I ask it) is said or thought, as 
far as it has appeared to you, of the conduct of the

by Proclamation & other expedients of the conse-

of this sort from me to you & your answers are for my

PHILADELPHIA, Novr. 23d., 1794. 
Dear Sir, 

It has not been in my power to acknowledge, with 
convenience, the receipt of your letter of the i4th. ulto. 
until now;-first, because it did not get to my hands 
until my return from the Westward, and adly, because 
my attention, ever since to the present moment, has 
been occupied in examing the various papers on which 
my communications to Congress were to be founded. 

I do not see how any one can decide so well on the 
project you have in contemplation as yourself, who has 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 181 

a view of all the circumstances of the case, before you;~ 
and who know how far so important a change in the 
scene, as that of transplanting yourself and family into 
a new country, is reconcilable to your feelings & dis- 
positions. and because, from the enquiries you have 
undoubtedly made, you must better know than any 
other who has turned his thoughts to the subject, what 
you can sell for here, and buy at there. 

It has always been my opinion that new countries (by 
this I mean the interior of our own) are the best to lay 
the foundation of wealth, in as much as lands which 
comparatively speaking, are to be had there cheap, 
rise in a fourfold ratio to what they do on the Atlantic 
Sea. and it is to this circumstance, and the opportun- 
ities of acquiring them (by being on the scene) that the 
advantages consist. as, until the navigation of the 
Mississippi can be obtained, or the communication 
between the Eastern & Western Waters be made more 
easy, than is the case at present, the principal demand 
for the product of the land is found in the emigrants 
who resort to it. To this cause also, is to be ascribed 
the rapidly increasing prices of those lands. 

In one part of your letter, you talk of removing to 
Kentucky; and in another, of investing money in lands 
to West of the Ohio, which creates a doubt as to your 
principal view. You are not uninformed, I presume, 
that there is no land office open at this time in the last 
mentioned District; and that there is no means by 
which land can be obtained there, at present, except by 
purchase of Army rights, or from some of those com- 
panies to whom Congress have sold large tracts : and 
in the present stage of our disputes with the Indians, 
that no settlement is thought safe from the scalping 
knife, that is not under the protection of some fort. 
The same indeed may be said of the frontiers of Ken- 
tucky, while the central lands in that state are, as I am 



i8* LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

informed, selling very high. Btit of these facts you 
must be better informed than I am, 

I should think it perfectly expedient as soon as you 
shall have resolved to sell your lands on Rappahanock 
to advertise it in all the principal Gazettes, from 
Richmond to New York inclusively; and not to be too 
hasty in dispossing of it, except for a very good price ; 
as there are reasons to believe that in the course of this 
winter and the ensuing spring and summer, many men 
of property from Europe will remove to this country, 
or send over their property, with a view to invest it, 
either in our funds, or in lands. 

With respect to the other species of property, con- 
cerning which you ask my opinion, I shall frankly de- 
clare to you that I do not like even to think, much less 
talk of it. However, as you have put the question, I 
shall, in a few words, give you my ideas of it. Were it 
not then, that I am principled agt. selling negroes, as 
you would do cattle at a market, I would not, in twelve 
months from this date, be possessed of one as a slave. 
I shall be happily mistaken, if they are not found to be 
a very troublesome species of property ere many years 
pass over our heads (but this by the bye) For this 
reason and because there is but little sale for what is 
raised in the western country, it remains for you to 
consider whether their value would not be more pro- 
ductive in lands, reserving enough for necessary pur- 
poses, than to carry many of them, there. My love 
to Mrs. Spotswood and the family. 

I am Dear Sir Your Affecte Servant

" PHILADELPHIA, Jany. isth., 1795. 

Sir, 

I avail myself of your obliging offer to dispose of the 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 183 

lands I hold in the counties of Fayette & Washington,- 
hereby empowering you to see the same on the terms 
which have been mentioned to you. 

If one fourth of the money is paid at the time of con- 
veyance or within a short period thereafter, I would 
allow four, five or six years credit for the other three 
fourths ; provided the payment thereof be well secured 
agreeably to contract; and the interest in the mean- 
while assured with punctuality as it becomes due, in 
one of the Banks of this city or in either of those of 
Baltimore, Georgetown or Alexandria. The regular 
payment of which, at stated periods being a primary 
consideration with me. 

The tract in Fayette County contains 1,544^ acres 
besides the usual allowance of P. C. The other, by 
Patent, is 2,813 acres but by aresurvey was found to 
measure more than 3,000 acres. A description of them 
would be nugatory, the presumption being that the 
purchaser whomsoever he may be, will examine the 
land and judge for himself. It may not be amiss, how- 
ever, that it should be generally known that both tracts 
has improved, and that one of them has a mill there on, 
and a considerable of Iron Ore within less than 30 
yards of the Mill house, 

Having from long experience found that landed 
property at a distance from the proprietor, who is not 
able to pay attention to it, is more productive of plague 
than profit, I feel strongly disposed to sell all the lands 
I hold on the Ohio and Great Kanhawa; (about 33,000 
acres)* in Seven surveys, provided I can obtain, by giv- 
ing a pretty long credit, what I conceive it is worth. 
For the reason already mentioned, a particular des- 
cription of these lands would in a manner be useless 
but it may not be amiss to add, that they are the cream 
of the country in which they lye, the first chosen of it ;- 
and are entirely free from disputes of every kind. 



184 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

The whole is internal land, boarded by the rivers above 
mentioned, and margined by them 59 miles. They 
consist of three Surveys on the Ohio, and four on the 
Great Kanhawa. The first named are on the East side 
of the River, betwn. the little and great Kanhawa; 
the frost of these tracts, is the first large bottom below 
the motith of the little Kanhawa, and about 13 miles 
from Mariatte; containing 2,314 aa, boarded by the 
river 5^ miles. The 2nd tract is the 4th large bottom 
(on the same side of the river) about 16 miles lower 
down, containing 2,048 acres, boarded by the river 3^ 
miles the third tract, is the next large bottom, 3^ 
miles lower down, opposite nearly to the great bend, 
containing 4,395 acres, with a margin of the River of 
five miles. The other four tracts are on the Great 
Kanhawa, as observed before. The first of them, is on 
the West side; beginning about two miles from its 
confluence with the Ohio, and boarded by the former 
17 miles; containing 10,990 acres. The seed, tract 
Is on the east side of the river a little higher up and con- 
tains 7,276 acs. boarded by the river 13 miles. The 
other two are at the mouth of Cole River, on both 
sides of the Kanhawa, and in the fork between ; contain- 
ing together 4,950 acres having afronton the river (both 
sides) of twelve miles. Besides these have a small 
tract of 587 acres on the Ohio, called the round bottom; 
lying opposite to the mouth of Pipe Creek, which is 
about 15 miles below Wheeling; but nothing short of a 
large price would induce me to part with this tract 
it is bordered by the river 2f miles. The soil is of the 
very richest quality, is in the shape of a horse shoe, with 
a beautiful situation for a house thereon. 

Any services you can render me in the disposal of 
these lands on the terms I have conversed with you

Dear Sir, 

Herewith, you will receive Plate, and description of 
two tracts of land which I hold in Kentucky, on the 
Waters of Eough Creek, If you have any knowledge 
of the land in the part of the country these are said to 
lye in; or, if your brother John or any other within 
your reach has, I shd. be obliged to you, for such in- 
formation respecting them as can be obtained. I 
wish also to know in what part of the state of Ken- 
tucky they lye ; and what the selling price of lands 
thereabouts is. In a word, what you think mine are 
worth from the description given of them and part 
they lye in. 

The papers I send are copies, which you may keep; 
and when you go in to Kentucky, as I think you said it 
was your intention to do the coming Spring, I would 
thank you for investigating this subject fully, and for 
writing me a particular account of the Land, and what 
you suppose it is worth and would seE for, whether 
they lye in or out of the settled part of the State what 
the properties of the land are, and whether the 
streams with which it is said to abound are fit for water 
works. If they lye near your own lands I could wish 
to receive the details from your own view of them, and 
observation thereon.

family join, concludes me your sincere friend and

i86 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

PHILADELPHIA, i7th. May, 1795* 
Sir* 

I liave received your letter of the 8th. inst. and if 
writings drawn strictly conformable to the spirit of the 
instructions contained in the enclosed letter to Charles 
Lee, Esqr. (left open for your perusal) will answer your 
views in the purchase of my land on Difficult run they 
may be prepared by him, and sent to me for the sig- 
nature on my part. for the other hand adhering as 
strictly as I do to the principle on which I set out, does 
not meet your approbation, be so good as to return the 
letter and deeds therein, & the receipt of them will 
not be less acceptable than the first named writings. 

You will perceive by these instructions, that not a 
stick of timber, wood, coal or ore (if any should be on 
the land) is to be removed therefrom, until the purchase 
money is paid. This may be interpreted (at first view 
a rigid clause ; inasmuch as the ground which may be 
cleared, & the timber which may be cut for fencing & 
other purposes, might afford more firewood that the 
immediate demand of the farm might require; this 
may be true, but it does not follow that it will be lost if 
corded. To husband it therefore (while I retain an 
interest in the land) ; to avoid all inducement to fell it, 
faster than the farm may require; and to avoid all 
ground for dispute. in a word, not to lessen the value 
of the property until it is actually gone from my use my 
motives to this precaution especially, as the removal 
from off the land of a timber tree or two or a few cords 
of wood might give rise to a magnified pale which might 
induce investigation; & be productive of unpleasant 
sensations : to avoid which is more desirable than to 
apply a remedy. 

I am Sir, Your Obedient Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To MR. JOHN GILL, 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 187 

PHILADELPHIA, iyth. May, 1795. 
Dear Sir, 

Mr. GUI (of Alexandria) and I, have been in treaty 
some time for a small tract of land which I hold in 
Loudoun County on Difficult run, at the bridge on the 
Leesburgh road. If he will agree to the following terms 
from the spirit of which there will be no departure 
such writings as will subserve both of our purposes, I 
pray you to draw. 

i st. For him to hold the land by lease, for the term 
of ten years, to commence from the date of the 
instrument for the use and occupation of which 
he is to pay in coin of the United States, or other 
money current at the time, & equivalent thereto, 
four hundred and thirty three dollars and a 
third yearly, and every year during the contin- 
uance of the said lease, at the Bank of Alex- 
andria, for which a check is to be given. 
2nd. If any part of the said sum of 433! shall be be- 
hind, or unpaid in manner aforesd, thirty days 
after the same shall become due, it shall & may 
be lawful (and optional for me to re-enter and 
take possession of the premises as if no such 
lease had ever been granted, and if property 
shouldn't be found thereon adequate to the rent, 
recourse in the ordinary mode may be resorted 
to for recovery of the same. 
3rd. That not a timber tree stick of wood, coal 
'made therefrom or ore, if any be on the land, 
shall be removed therefrom under any pretense 
whatsoever; or used otherwise than for the ptir- 
poses of the premises. 

4th. That for the support and benefit of the same, 
there shall be left standing on the said tract, at 
the expiration of the lease a fourth part, at 
least, of the wood, 



i88 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

5tiu It Is understood and agreed, and the parties 
accordingly are to bind themselves as follow 
viz. John Gill, his heirs &ca. to pay to George 
Washington his heirs &ca. on or at any time be- 
fore the expiration of the aforementioned term 
of ten years, the sum of Six thousand, six hun- 
dred and sixty six dollars, & two thirds of a 
dollar, in the manner aforementioned; and for 
surety thereof is to give his own bond if suffici- 
ent penalty. In consideration of which pay- 
ment, well and truly performed George Wash- 
ington, or his heirs &c. is to convey, in fee 
simple, the aforesaid tract; and the rent thence- 
forward is to cease, & determine. 

6th. Where by Deeds of lease & release from the 
Revd. Mr. Fairfax to me, the stream of Diffi- 
cult run is made the boundary between the land 
thus conveyed, and land conveyed by Deed from 
(space in original) to on the other, or lower side 
of the run whereas by the last mentioned deed, 
a straight line is called for as the boundary be- 
tween the two tracts, which may, according to 
circumstances, occasion a diminution in the 
quantity of my land ; now it is understood and 
agreed, (be this as it may) that no alteration, 
consequent thereof, is to take place in the rent, 
or in the purchase money of this tract: for by 
the tract and not by the acre, I sell it. The Deed 
from Mr. Fairfax to me specifies two hundred & 
seventy five acres only: Just by a resurvey, if I 
recollect rightly, it measures Three hundred & 
three acres, but I mean to give no other war- 
rants than I have received of it ; and from this, 
to accept what might be involved in dispute 
by the different lines, & so I would have it

expressed, in order to avoid a controversy 
hereafter.

To CHARLES LEE, Esqr. 

PHILADELPHIA, 25th. May 1795. 
5Vr, 

With much sensibility I received your polite letter 
of the 25th. of March from Kingston. 

I thank you, Sir, for the plants which are mentioned 
in the list which accompanied it. Presuming they ar- 
rived at Norfolk with the letter, I have requested a 
gentleman of my acquaintance at that place to forward 
them to my Garden at Mount Vernon on the Potomack 
River, near Alexandria, Virginia, and I feel myself 
particularly obliged by the offer to supply me with 
other plants for the Botanical gardens in Jamaica, 

When my situation will allow me to pay more at- 
tention than I am able to do at present, to situations of 
this kind, which combine utility, ornament and amuse- 
ment I shall certainly avail myself of the liberty you 
have authorized me to take, in requesting a small 
supply of such exotics, as, with a little aid may be re- 
conciled to the climate of my garden. In the mean- 
time, I will cause inquiry to be made for the plants 
which are required for your garden at Liguanea agree- 
ably to the list of Mr. .Wiles. 

I am, Sir Your Obedt. Hble. Servt.

To FARLIE CHRISTIE, Esqe. 

PHILADELPHIA, June 27th., 1795. 
Sir, 

Had the terms on which I offered you my land in 



igo LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Fayette county been complied with on your part, the 
bargain, as I informed you in my letters, would have 
been conclusive on mine, But this not being done, and 
the end of June likely to be as reproductive as the first 
of It, of the payment which was then to have been made, 
I conceive myself tinder no obligation to fulfil the offer 
I made you on the i4th of January last, of the above- 
mentioned land. Nevertheless, if by the first day of 
August next you shall pay One thousand pounds 
Pennsylvania curry, with interest thereon down the 
first day of June and interest on the remaining sum 
from that first of June agreeably to the former pro- 
posals, in the letter above mentioned and do, more- 
over pay up all arrearages of Rent (on account of which 
I learn from Colo. Cannon, to my very great surprise, 
much is due) the conveyance will be made to you in 
the same manner as if payment had, according to 
agreement, taken place on the first of this month, If 
it is not, I do hereby declare, that the former agreement 
& the present offer, will be considered as null and void, 
to all interests and purposes, as much so, as if no ne- 
gotiation had ever taken place between us for the said 
land. 

With esteem & regard I am Sir 

Your Very Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To COLO. ISRAEL SHREVE. 

PHILADELPHIA, 28th June, 1795. 
Sir, 

Business, and other circumstances, have prevented 
my acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 23d. 
of April until now, that I do it by Mr. Ross. 

I have seen Colo. Cannon, and in strong terms have 
represented to him the impropriety of his delay in fur- 
nishing you with a statement of the concerns between 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 191 

(him in my behalf) and the tenants in the counties of 
Fayette & Washington, & in not making a final settle- 
ment of all the accounts between us. If any depen- 
dence can be placed in his assurances, he would as soon 
as he returned home be ready to render his accounts, 
and give in this statement which has been required of 
him but he is continually reducing the Rents under 
pretence of allowing for improvements. This, to be 
sure, is singular enough, for fencing &ca. of plantations or 
farms which have been settled fifteen or twenty years. 
If the tenants on Dogue run have carried wheat to Colo. 
Cannon's mill, it behoves them to receive payment for 
it, and therewith to discharge their rents to you; for I 
shall look to them and not to him, from whom I can get 
nothing without more trouble than it is worth and 
who ought not to have concerned himself with the 
business after it was put in your hands which are due 
after that period. 

It would be well to ascertain what is due from Colo. 
Shreve on account of Rent as soon as possible for he will 
receive no conveyance of the lands on which he lives 
until all the arrears due thereon (as well as the first 
payment of the purchase money) are paid up. 

Having experienced more losses than profit in col- 
lecting the rents of the lands in the counties before 
mentioned. It is my intention to sell both tracts if I 
can obtain what I conceive to be my worth of them as 
leases therefore might impede the sale, I am not dis- 
posed at this time, under these circumstances to give 
any. Among the papers which were deposited in the 
hands of Colo. Cannon, were copies of the Surveys of 
my lands on the Ohio & great Kanhawa; if these 
should have been received by you, I request that they 
may be given, or by some safe conveyance sent to Colo, 
Ross your Senator. And I pray you to write me, as 
soon as you can, what state my business is in with the 



192 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Tenants what sum you have actually received on 
account o Rent what you have a prospect of soon 
receiving and what is due. In short, I wish to know 
what the real situation of my affairs, as they respect 
these tracts is. 

I do not know of any business which the United 
States have, at the time that requires Surveyors, nor 
likely to be until a land office is opened, whether this 
will happen I know no more than you do.

PHILADELPHIA, xoth July, 1795. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the gth of March, and the works which 
accompanied it, I have had the pleasure to read but 
not that of seeing Mr. Wilson ; who either from his own 
engagements, or knowledge he obtained of mine, must 
have been prevented from calling. For the books I 
thank you. 

You much over rate any civilities which chance may 
have enabled me to show you in the course of the War 
between Great Britain and this country. The view 
which you are to take of the latter, is flattering to it. 
I hope it will deceive none who may turn their atten- 
tion hitherward. 

I have the honor to be Sir 
Yr. Obedt. Servt.

(Private) PHILADELPHIA yth, Feby. 1796 

Dear Sir 

I am glad to find by the last letter which we have 
received from our friend in the Federal City that you 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 193 

had recovered from the indisposition the proceeding 
ones announced. 

You will perceive by the enclosed advertisement, 
that I am making an essay to accomplish what I com* 
municated to you in confidence when I was last in 
Virginia. I call it an essay because I have no sanguine 
expectation of ameliorating the plan so far as to cany 
it into complete effect in the course of next year. If 
I can succeed so far as to be enabled to give up the 
Dower negros at all, and at terms below what impartial 
me, & shall say their hire is worth, it will amount to 
the full extent of my expectation, and this I would wish 
to accomplish before the other part of my plan is at- 
tempted: and quite enough it will be, when it is con- 
sidered how much the Dower Negros and my own are 
intermarried and the former with the neighboring 
Negros, to part whom will be an affecting and trying 
affair, happen when it will. For which, and other rea- 
sons, I wish no mention to be made thereof until the way 
is a little more open; until I see what effect the adver- 
tisement will have; I shall soon tell from these devel- 
opements. I shall be able to take more decisive 
measures ; or in other words, then I shall be able to 
support myself without these aids. If I can accom- 
plish the first part of the plan, in any manner tolerably 
convenient & satisfactory to all that are interested in 
it, I certainly will do it. The whole part must depend 
in some measure on the succedaneum; & an elibable 
mode of carrying it into effect. The current of my 
wishes is stronger to the second than to the first part of 
the plan, but reasons of a political indeed of im- 
perious nature must make it a posterior operation. 

Among other reasons for promulgating, as exten- 
sively as I mean to do, the renting of my farms, is the 
expectation that some of the Gazettes in which the 
advertisement is inserted, will find their way into 



i 9 4 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

England or Scotland, and may induce such associations 
as are therein alluded to, to form and corne out, for I 
have no idea of frittering up the farms, for the accomo- 
dation of our country farmers, whose knowledge 
practice at least centres in the destruction of the 
land, and very little beyond it, I neither expect nor 
desire that associations from either England or Scot- 
land would form and come out hap-hazard ; but such 
associations might send a confidential person to espy 
the land, -and report to them: and if it should fall 
in your way to suggest anything of this sort to any of 
the British merchants* of your acquaintance as from 
yourself, I should be obliged to you. I shall in less 
than a week, or on this day week, communicate the 
terms on which these farms (will be let to M. S. Faar- 
say (?) ) 

1 find by our last letters from the Federal city that 
Betsey Custis has cast her lot very much she says, 
to her own satisfaction having given it due weight 
and consideration in every point of view she could 
place the matter so, of course disparity in age could 
not have escaped. Mr. Law, so far as I have obtained 
any knowledge of his character, is a respectable man 
and much esteemed, and is reputed to be wealthy: 
but he is a stranger, and may, at least in a degree, be 
an Agent, for which reasons, I think prudence requires, 
and as a man of honor he cannot refuse, to make a 
settlement upon her previous to marriage; of her 
own fortune, if no more. 

Speaking on this subject, it reminds me of another, 
which has anology to it; that is in allotting to Mr. 
Thomas Peter the Negros who fell to the share of his 
wife had you adverted to the circumstance, that 
Mrs. Washington's Dower Negros (which were hired 
to her father) were not to have been among those to 
a share of whom she has any claim? If you did not,

and they assisted to form the aggregate, of which 
the division was made, the proceeding was either 
wrong, or I am tinder a misconception of the right of 
Washington Custis. I suggest the quest for informa- 
tion, ist as to the fact next, if the case has happened, 
as to the right, then if a mistake has happened, the 
sooner it is rectified the better. With great esteem 
and regard, I am Dear Sir

To David Stuart, Esq., 7th. Feb. 1796. P 

PHILADELPHIA, i4th. Novr., 1796. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 9th. has been duly received. 
When I authorized Mr. Pearce to sell my flour, I limited 
him to the largest credit the circumstances of my own 
concert would enable me to give, consistently with my 
own wants & the arrangements I had contemplated. 
To extend the credit ninety days longer, would not only 
damage my own plans but, as the same causes will 
always produce the same effects, at the end of ninety 
days, a further indulgence might be required. 

It is from the produce of this flour that Mr. Pearce 
himself; all the Overseers, and a variety of other 
incidental expences, are to be paid. It is, and ever has 
been a rule with me, never to suffer a man to look for a 
just debt without receiving payment; and before I 
left home (repeating it since) in very strong terms, I 
have directed Mr. Pearce to settle with every one, and 
pay to the last farthing I owe ; that there may be no 
after claim when he is gone, either upon his successor or 
myself. I mention these facts and circumstances, to 
show you how inconvenient it will be for me to comply 
with yottr request- 



1 96 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Nevertheless, being unwilling to distress anyone, if it 
be possible to avoid it, I shall direct Mr. Pearce in the 
letter. I am about to write to him, to say, to ascertain 
the aggregate sum required, to pay the demands upon 
him, on my account, and if you will give him the most 
& equivocal surety of paying it on, or before the 24th of 
December (that he may have time between that and 
the first of January to clear himself out;) and will give 
unquestionably security also that the residue shall be 
paid on or before the first day of March. both sums 
carrying interest from the day they have become due 
until paid that he may fix the matter with you agree- 
ably thereto. I cannot forbear aiding, however, that the 
receipt of the whole sum, on the day it becomes due, 
would be infinitely more pleasing to me. but if this can- 
not be, you are to expect no favor from me in case of a 
second disappointment.

Dear Sir, 

I am sorry to hear that your cold is obstinate, & your 
indisposition continues. 

If it will permit you to give a little attention to the 
Virginia address, to day, that it may be dispatched by 
the Post of tomorrow, I would thank you. 

In the moment I received it, I sketched something by 
way of an anoner, but whether I have therein said too 
much, or too little for the circumstances attending the 
address, or whether those circumstances ought to 
have the least influence in the reply (notwithstanding 
as you will perceive by the Gazette enclosed, & which I 
request may be returned, what the temper of the State 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 197 

is relative to the Administration) is problamatical : 
Therefore, and because you are better acquainted with 
the Legislature of politics of Virginia than I am I would 
be guided by your advice and accordingly, if your 
health will allow it, I should be obliged to you for an 
entire new draught of an answer, on such -unreserved 
corrections of the one sent as you may think is per- 
fectly applicable to the case civil & unexceptionable. 
I wish you better health and am your sincere friend 
and Affectionate Servant

Dear Sir, 

For want of a Memo, from the Overlooker of my 
Carpenters (which I thought I had brought with me 
from Mount Vernon) I am unable to furnish an accurate 
Bill of the Plank & Scantling my purposes require; 
but as the former of these never comes amiss to me, I 
would enage 

5000 feet of Inch] 

2500 Do of i i & Vas free as possible from'sap. 
1000 Do of i -J J 

and should be glad to know from the person in whom 
you could most confide, whether upon receiving a Bill 
of Scantling & an additional 9 ft. of Plank, after I re- 
turn home, I could be supplied therewith, delivered 
at Mount Vernon, & in how short a time after receiving 
the said Bill. With very great esteem & regard 
I am Dear Sir 

Your Obedt. Servant

198 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

PHILADELPHIA, sth. Feb., 1797. 
Mr. Anderson, 

Your letter of the ist. instant, with the weekly re- 
ports are received. 

If all that part of the new road from the cattsay to 
the white gates is completed and fit for use, it has gone 
on better than I expected; and makes me wish more 
that the other part was done; that the whole might be 
fit for use against my return, but I do not desire it to 
be attempted to the injury of more important work, 

When Davy is about the fencing at Muddy Hole, let 
that part on which the gate is (going into the farm) 
be continued in a straight line, as it now runs, until it 
strikes the new road, and then in a parallel line there- 
with, until it joins the fence again on the hill, before it 
reaches the causay after which, to run as it now does to* 
wards No, 6, when over that part of it shall be repaired. 

The method you propose, to get the Peas, from Mr. 
Lawson Carter, is much better than sending all the 
distance by land, in the state the roads now are, & will 
be until they are well settled after frosts are entirely 
over. But notwithstanding these peas as promised 
by that gentleman, I would not have you be too san- 
guine of the receipt of them, unless you should receive 
from him, positive assurance thereof the quantity 
and when, and how they are to be obtained. Of course, 
it may not be amiss to devise, in time, what is to be 
done in case of failure. 

I consent to your cultivating in corn the field at 
Dogue run which is mentioned in your letter, and leave 
the whole arrangement, of the crops at Union farm to 
your own judgment, but you have not attended to the 
quantity in that part of Va. which lyes between the 
meadow, mill road lane going into the Barn therefrom, 
if you suppose it contains 80 acres. it will amount to 
more than 50 at most. 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 199 

In clearing that piece of Mill swamp adjoining the 
road (and I am glad you have undertaken it) do not 
think it too much of single trees thereby stripping it of 
both shade & ornament. I am perfectly satisfied of the 
great quantity of ground I have, capable of being con- 
verted into good meadow and have wished always to do 
it but, these wishes (and being so much from home) 
have not met the means of accomplishment. 

Grain harrowed in, certainly looks better in Autumn, 
than that which is planed ; but in land which is apt 
to heave (or spew as it is called) the moulderings on the 
ridges when ploughed, gives, as is supposed, fresh earth 
and nourishment to the roots and therefore is pre- 
ferred by many farmers experience only, in such 
soils, can alone decide the question. 

I shall be able to ascertain on good conjectural 
grounds what may be expected for flour & will let you 
know when, and at what price to sell. In the mean- 
time keep me advised of the prices of that article in. 
Alexandria. 

As spades, shovels, scythes, nails, nail rods Iron 
plates for the mould boards of ploughs Bar iron & 
most other things can be had upon better terms here 
than in Alexandria & as I must engage a vassal to 
carry my furniture round let me know the quantity, 
& sorts of each of these articles that will be wanted & 
any others and I will endeavour to provide them. 
Do you not want Riddles for gleaning grain &ca, 
How many and of what degrees of finess? 

Send me the sizes of the four rooms on the lower 
floor (at Mount Vernon) which open into the passage. 

Have you Buck Wheat for Seed? although my at- 
tempts, hitherto, to raise it as a crop, and for a green 
dressing have never answered my expectations, yet I 
am very willing it should undergo further trials. 

I think of nothing more, at present, necessary to

To MR. JAMES ANDERSON. 

PHILADELPHIA, 6th. Feb., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

The 3d of March which is fast approaching, will put 
an end to my political career; and I shall have another 
to commence through mud & mire, to reach more 
tranquil scenes at Mount Vernon. This I shall do 
without delay, or attempt it at least, be the roads in 
what condition, they may, at that time. 

To enable me to accomplish this journey, with such 
baggage as I do not incline to risk by water, I shall 
want a pair of strong horses that are true & steady to 
the draught fera waggon, lighter than a coachee, to 
carry some trunks (not heavy) at the rate we shall 
travel, which must be soon. 

Would you oblige me so far as to make this purchase, 
and to have the horses in this City by the first day of 
March? I should prefer Mares, and wish them to 
match in (any) colour. They ought not to exceed Six, 
or at any rate seven years old next spring nor ought 
they to be under fifteen hands high. As they will be 
put to the Plough, or Waggon, after I get them home. 
I should prefer cheapness to appearance ; & the reason 
why I mention Mares instead of Geldings, is, that 
Mules may be bred from them afterwards but I must 
take either. 

Be so good as to let me know, without delay, whether 
I can, or cannot, place certain dependence on you for 
the purchase, & having them here by the time before 
mentioned. The money shall be paid on delivery; or 
if required, shall be sent to you before ; for the purpose 
of instant payment. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 201 

I will offer no apology for giving you this trouble, be- 
cause I persuade myself you are disposed to serve me 
in it. 

With esteem. I am Dear Sir 

Your Obedt Servt 

G. WASHINGTON 1 . 

P. S. Let me request the favor of you to have the 
steadiness of the horses to the draught proved, before 
they are sent here ; for to be plagued with them on the 
road would be dreadful 
To MR. MATTHIAS SLOUGH. 

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

The enclosed is the copy of a letter I wrote you agree- 
ably to the date ; but as it was to take its chance from 
the stage office, and letters by private conveyances do 
not always get to their destination, I trouble you with 
a duplicate; as well on that account, as because I find 
my journey home requires the purchase of a third horse* 
or Mare, for the draught.- 

This third one, must, in every respect, be confor- 
mable to the description of the last one except (as it 
is to go with three others which I have) that it ought 
to be a bay, and of somewhat better figure. For the 
reason mentioned in my last, I should prefer, greatly, 
Mares ; and if they were to be here before the first of 
March (that they might be exercised together, & with 
breast plates instead of collars) it would be desirable.* 

At any rate let me hear from you as soon as con- 
venient that I may know what to depend upon. With 
esteem & regard, 

I am Dear Sir

202 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

PHILADELPHIA, 27th Feb. 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

Yotir letter of the 226.. inst, was delivered to me 
yesterday morning by Mr, Root, who also delivered the 
Mares & horse. The latter being too clumsy about the 
head & legs to suit my carriage horses, and too high in 
price for a common plough horse, I return him ; since, 
as you say, no inconvenience will attend it. I must 
now, as I expect to leave this in ten days, depend upon 
purchasing a horse, or Mare in this City or neighbour- 
hood. You will please therefore to take the price of the 
Mares, and whatever incidental expenses have been in- 
curred in getting them and the horse here, out of the 
Six hundred Dollars sent you. I have paid Mr. Root 
nothing, as you did not mention, in your letter, on 
what terms he was to bring them down: whatever 
you do in this case will be satisfactory to me. 

I am very sensible of the polite attentions of the 
Inhabitants of Lancaster, as expressed by you ; but as I 
am anxious to get home, and shall have almost as far to 
it from that Borough as from hence, and the Road after 
quitting the Turn pike very little better, I shall pursue 
the most direct & usual rout to obtain the end. For 
the good wishes you have expressed for me, on the 
anniversary of my birth, I pray you to accept the 
best thanks of 

Dear Sir

MOUNT VERNON, 1 2th June 1797 
Dear Sir, 

If you have had leisure to examine my unimproved 
lot in Alexa, more attentively, and have digested 
any plan in your own mind for an advantageous 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 203 

division of it, I would thank you for the result, as I 
wish to fix on a Plan. 

I was informed, when in Town last, that Mr. Voss 
(I think the name is) would give i8d. a sqr. yard for 
the earth to make bricks & that he would not deface, 
or injure the lot in doing so. What is your opinion 
on this point? 

Mr. Anderson has engaged me in a distillery, on a 
small scale, and is very desirous of increasing it: 
assuring me from his own experience in this country, 
& in Europe that I shall find my acct. in it; partic- 
ularly in the benefits my stock would derive from it. 
The third is new to me, in toto ; but in a distillery of 
another kind (Molasses) you must have a good general 
knowledge of its profits, & whether a ready sale 
of the Spirit is to be calculated on from grain (prin- 
cipally to be raised on my own farms) and the offal of 
.,my mill. I therefore have taken the liberty of asking 
your opinion on the proposition of Mr. Anderson. 
Such a house as he requires, except the Stiles, I could 
provide at a small expenditure.

I am Dear Sir

Revd. . Sir, 

It is with regret I find myself under the necessity of 
becoming an apologist for others. 

Until lately I had no other expectation, or wish, than 
that the two misses (my nieces & cousin to each other) 
were preparing for their journey to & establishment 
at Bethlehem, But I am informed that one of them 
(Maria Washington) on whose acct. the first applica- 



204 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

tion was made, is in very declining health, (in short 
that she is in a consumption) and the before adjudged 
by her Aunt, with whom she lives, is unfit for the 
charge which had been contemplated and as a principal 
inducement to the other's (daughter to Colo. Bab) 
going was that they might continue together, I have 
been advised (both living at a considerable distance 
from me) that, under the circumstances I have related, 
it is not intended now, to send either. 

I hope, as it always appeared to me that your con- 
sent to admit these girls at the time you did the 
School being full was matter of favour, for which I 
felt the obligation, that no inconvenience will result 
from the change which has taken place.

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the nth. of Feb: and a duplicate 
thereof, have been duly received, and I pray you to 
accept my best thanks for the trouble you have had 
in tracing to its origin, the history of the Sword which 
came to my hands last year in the manner communi- 
cated in a former letter, As it is more than probable 
you will have left Holland before this letter can be 
received I shall give you no further trouble in the affair 
than merely to inform you that I have never seen, 
or heard more of Alte than the account given of him 
in your letter of the above mentioned date.

you then wrote, seated under my Vine & Pig-tree; 
where, while I am permitted to enjoy the shade of it.

of its utility, as it relates to the public interest. ** 

For the kind expression which you have extended 
to me, for the approbation of those sentiments I have

MOUNT VERNON, 26th. June, 1797. 
Sir, 

From the good report I have had of your improved 
threshing machine, I am desirous of getting one or two 
of them erected, and as expediously as possible. 

The Scaneling for two, upon the Plan of Mr. Jeffer- 
son & others, of the Scotch machine, had been got be- 
fore 1 received the account of yours ; and may, I pre- 
sume, be appropriated to the latter. The purpose 
therefrom of this letter, is to know if you would under- 
take to erect mine, so, if your other engagements 
should prevent your personal attendance, whether a 
person in whose knowledge & skill in the matter, you 
cd. place entire confidence, could be sent; or, lastly 



206 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

whether you could spare time to make me a visit for the 
purpose of directing my own Carpenters (six or 7 in 
number, & some of them competent to follow any di- 
rection) to proceed to the execution, and for which die 
compensation would be made you. 

I must beg the favour of a speedy answer (by Post to 
Alexandria) that I may know what I have to rely on ; 
for if I cannot have them erected upon your plan in a 
short time, I shall proceed upon the one I had at first 
contemplated, so desirous am I of getting my Wheat 
out early. 

I am Sir 

Your Obedt. Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To MR. WILLIAM BOOKER. 

MOUNT VERNON, 26th June, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

When you informed me that Mr. Booker was erect- 
ing a threshing machine for one Gentleman in your 
neighbourhood, I expressed a wish that he would come 
hither, but intended before we parted to have been more 
pointed in my request on this head, but your trip to the 
Federal City and early departure the morning after 
you returned, were the occasions of my forgetting to 
do so. 

Let me now ask the favour of you, if Mr. Booker is at 
the place you supposed he would be, to endeavour to 
engage him to proceed (and at as early a moment as he 
can make it convenient) to this place ; if it was only for 
the purpose of directing my people, if he could not him- 
self remain to see the execution, how to proceed; 
The cantling for one of the Scotch machines being al- 
ready prepared, wants only a director to make the al- 
terations, " put it together. For his time, and trouble 
he shall be paid. At any rate, if this letter should get 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 207 

to your hands, let me know what dependence I can have 
on Mr. Booker. 

I have discovered many of the Hassian flies in my 
Wheat since you left this ; but their attack of it was 
made too late to do it much injury ; but as they may be 
considered as the harbingers of those that are to come, 
I am under considerable apprehensions from this threat- 
ened calamity. I began my Wheat on Thursday last, 
and find the growth good, however short the crop 
may be. 

Present our love to Mrs. Carter and be assured' of the 
great esteem & affectionate regard of 
Dear Sir 

Your Obedient Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To CHARLES CARTER, Esq. 

MOUNT VERNON, 2 6th June, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

Until last week, I had no suspicion that the Hassian 
fly was among my Wheat, but upon examination I 
found there were many. They have come too late 
this year, however, to do me much damage; but as I 
view them as the harbingers of those who will visit me 
next year, I would guard, as far as it may be in my 
power, against the threatened evil. 

Permit me therefore to ask, if from your own ex- 
perience, or from that of others on what you can rely 
it is ascertained whether Rye or Barley (Winter or 
Summer) is liable to this calamity? In the country 
above me, the Wheat, I am informed, entirely de- 
stroyed (in places) by this fly and from the appearances 
of them among mine it is but too probable it would be 
the case with mine next year, if I do not substitute 
other grain in its place. But what grain is the impor* 
tant question? Are oats affected by these flies ? 



COS LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Where this calamity has not visited the Wheat the 
grain is remarkably fine, and the quality not to be heard

MOUNT VERNON, July 2, 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

I have been in continual expectation of hearing that 
Colo. Shreve had deposited the amount of his second 
instalment in the Bank of Pennsylvania, agreeably to 
contract; but as a month has elasped since it ought to 
liave been done and no account of a payment there 
and as it has been usual with him to offer these in 
driblets by anybody at any time & in any manner 
regardless of his obligation thereby depriving me of 
the advantage of counting upon the money at the 
period when it becomes due which was a principal in- 
ducement to the sale I have enclosed you his Bond 
with a request that would put it suit, or take such 
other measures to obtain payment at his cost as you 
shall deem expedient. Below is the sums which have 
actually been reed. The Instalments. My best re- 
spects are presented to Mrs. Ross, & with very great

Not believing that Congress would adjourn so soon

not lay me under the necessity of putting his Judgment 
Bond in suit, I have forborne until now, to send it to 
Mr. Ross for that purpose. But as I believe he is one 
of that description of men who have very little idea 
of punctuality ; and as my wants require all my re- 
sources, I have now forwarded it under cover to you: 
but request that you would be so good before the letter 
which encloses it is handed to Mr. Ross, to enquire at 
the Bank of Pennsylvania if Shreve, or anyone in his 
behalf, has deposited therein for my use the sum of 
about two thousand dollars. In case this is done, I 
pray you to return to me my letter to Mr. Ross. If 
there be no deposit, then to give, or send it to that 
Gentleman by a safe conveyance, 

By the public Gazettes, two things seem to be cer- 
tain : Preliminaries between France & Austria of Peace, 
and a dangerous Crisis in England. A third however 
is necessary to give tranquility to this country, and that 
is actual Peace between the latter & France. Whether 
that would produce harmony is at least problematical, 
for I am sure the views of some among us would not 
be promoted by such an event.

212 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

MOUNT VERNON, 15 July, 1797. 
Sir, 

Since my last to you, dated in Philadelphia the 6th. 
of March, I have been honoured with yours and Lord 
Hawkes joint favour of the 28th. of March 1796 in- 
troductory of Doctr. Scandella; who gave me the 
pleasure of his company in June last, and whom I 
found a very sensible, and well informed man. 

I have also received your separate favours of the 26.* 
of February and 29th. of March, in the present year: 
The last accompanying your printed account of the 
origin of the Board of Agriculture and its progress for 
the three years after its establishment. For your 
kindness in forwarding of them, I pray you to accept 
my best thanks. 

I will keep one copy of this work myself, and shall 
read it, I am sure with pleasure, so soon as I have 
passed through my harvest, which is now nearly fin- 
ished; the other copies shall be put into such hands as 
I conceive will turn them to the best account. 

Your not having, in either of the letters acknow- 
ledged above, mentioned the receipt of two from me, 
dated the loth. & nth. of Deer, 1796, the last a 
private and very long one, fills my mind with appre- 
hension of a miscarriage, although I do not see how it 
should have happened, as they went with several other 
letters under cover to Mr. King (our Minister in Lon- 
don) who in a letter to me, dated the 6th. of February 
following after giving information of what he had done 
with my other letters, adds "and as soon as Sir John 
Sinclair returns to town I will also deliver the letter ad- 
dressed to him. " 

Was it not for this information I should, by this con- 
veyance, have forwarded a duplicate. 

The result of my enquiries of Members of Congress 
attending the December Session, varied so little from 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 213 

the details I had the honour to give you concerning the 
prices of land as in my private letter of the nth. of 
December as to render a second edition unnecessary. 
The reduction however, in the price of our produce 
since last year, (flour having fallen from fifteen to 
Seven or eight dollars a barrel, and other articles in 
that proportion) may occasion a fall in the price of 
Lands. A stagnation it has already produced and 
I have been told a reduction also, in some of the latter 
sales. 

Our crop of Wheat this year from the best infor- 
mation I have been able to obtain, will be found very 
short, owing to three causes ; an uncommon drought 
last autumn, a severe winter with but little snow to 
protect it, and, which is a little more to be regretted, 
to what with us is denominated the Hessian fly which 
has spread devastation, more or less in all quarters nor 
has the latter Wheat escaped the rust. The grain, 
however, except where the Rust appeared before it was 
hard is extremely fine. We are equally unlucky in our 
Oats, occasioned by a severe drought since the month of 
April. 

With sentiments of high esteem and regard, I have 
the honor to be Sir, 

Yr. Most Obedt. Hble. Servant 
To SIR JOHN SINCLAIR G. WASHINGTON, 

MOUNT VERNON, iyth. July, 1797. 

Sir 

My Overseers at Union and Dogue run Farms are 
endeavouring to play the same game they did last 
year that is to raise their wages ; but as I am fully re- 
solved that to do it (especially as the price of produce is 
reduced a hundred pr. ct.) I am induced to ask you 
as Clark who engaged with Mr. Craik is dead, & ex- 
pectation from that quarter is at an end if you could 



214 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

recommend a person whom you know would suit me, 
for Union farm? 

It is not impossible but that I may reduce the hands 
at Union farm & place it and Dogue run Farm under 
the same Over par, but since in this case, I will not 
give more than Sixty pounds wages, with the usual al- 
lowances of Provisions. 

I shall insist upon a Dairies being attended to by the 
Overseers wife and that Fowls shall be raised for my 
Table: And that nothing sold from the Farms for 
their benefit, as the wages with the allowances of Pro- 
visions is all the man & his wife have to expect. 

I would thank you for acknowledging the receipt of 
this letter by the Post as soon as it gets to hand, that I 
may be certain of its safe arrival: and as soon after 
as possible, let me know (without absolutely engaging 
any one) what dependence I could place on you getting 
a good man ; with, or without a wife, but not too large 
a family. It is necessary I should hear from you soon 
on this subject, as some are offering, & the season for 
engaging good overseers is at hand. 

I hope to hear your health is restores to you, and 
that your crops have been, and are likely to be good. 
My crop of Wheat is as good as I had any reason to ex- 
pect, but the Hassian fly began just before harvest to 
cut it down. Next year I expect their attack will be 
formidable & severe. Could we base dependence on 
purchasing three or 4 hundred bushels of Rye in your 
neighbourhood and at what price? 

I wish you & family well and axn your friend

MOUNT VERNON 2ist July 1797 
Dear Sir, 

I again take the liberty of requesting that the letters 
herewith sent may accompany your dispatches to Mr. 
King who I also hope will have the goodness to excuse 
the trouble I give him in this business, to insure the 
safety of the dispatches. 

I hope I shall not have occasion to give either of you 
much more trouble in this way, as correspondencies of 
this sort were not of my seeking, and I have no dis- 
position to keep them up, except with Sir John Sinclair 
(President of the National Board of Agriculture) on 
Agricultural subjects. 

One of the last productions of this Gentleman I 
transmit to you, with a request that if the Plan of 
establishing a similar Board in these United States 
should be re-entered upon at the next Session of Con- 
gress, you would be kind enough to lay it before the 
Committee which may be appointed for the purpose 
of preparing that business. I am always your Obedt. 
& Affecte. 

Servt.

MOUNT VERNON, 23d. July, 1797. 
Dear Sir> 

Receive my thanks for the information given in 
your letter of the 3d. of July, and for the offer you 
have obligingly made, of procuring for me, seed of the 
Yellow bearded wheat. 

Influenced by the opinion which prevailed some 
years since that that kind of Wheat would resist the 
Hassian fly I then procured seed of it, & have kept my- 
self in stock ever since, to make use of it upon a larger 
scale, if occasion shd. render it necessary. And so 



LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

well persuaded as I am that the attack of this insect 
will be severe next year, I shall reduce considerately, 
my seeding of Wheat the coming Autumn ; and fill the 
deficiency with Rye, principally. Of Wheat, however, 
I shall sow three kinds : the early, or May wheat, as it 
is called here, in a small proportion and the residue of 
the Yellow bearded, and a very fine white (also Wheat 
which I obtained last Fall from the mountains. 

Soon after I wrote you last the Rust seized my 
Wheat, straw and a good deal injured the latter grain. 
And a severe drought which we have laboured under 
since April, until this day week, has rendered our crop 
of Oats extremely short & rendered our meadows 
scarcely worth cutting and till now, by a second fine 
rain yesterday, left no little hope of making Indian 
Corn. 

Present me & Mrs. Washington in affectionate terms 
to Mrs. Peters, and be assured of the sincere esteem & 
regards 

Dear Sir

MOUNT VERNON 31 July 1797 
Dear Sir, 

I did not expect that I should have had occasion 
to trouble you again relative to my administration of 
the estate of Colo. Thomas Colvill. But the Gentleman 
who instituted the suit in the Chancery Court of this 
State informs me that it is indispensable that an 
affidavit of the Decree's having been published two 
months successively in an English paper (as appears 
prima facia to be required) should be returned and 
he wishes much to possess the same by the next term, 
in March, early. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 217 

Taking it for granted that the Decree has been pub- 
lished two months successively, I presume and hope 
there can be no difficulty in having it testified by the 
Editor of the paper in which it was inserted, and for- 
warded to me by duplicate. 

Excuse me, I pray you, for giving you this trouble, 
and be assured always of the high esteem and great 
regard of 

Dear Sir Your obliged & Obed. Servt.

MOUNT VERNON 7th August 1797 
Sir, 

I know nothing of the Bond of which you speak in 
your letter of the 4th. instant. If any such is in my 
possession unsettled (of which by the bye) I do not 
believe ; it must, by frequent shif tings and removals, 
have got so out of place as to render it impracticable 
for me to find, as there is no such bond where it ought 
to be, if I had it. By my books, I find the account of 
Mr. Kirk thus stated 

Dr. To balance of yr acct. on my Mill Book 58. 7.10^ 
Cr. Settled by the assignment of a Bond of 

Magee's 58. 7. xof 

So far as my memory serves me, the Bond was inade- 
quate to discharge the above bale, with interest due 
thereon, but as it was with difficulty I could get any 
thing, and this was likely to be the whole t it was taken 
& reed, as discharge, & the Bond given up: for the 
name of Magee is not to be found in my Book of %. I

ai8 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

MOUNT VERNON, nth. Aug. 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favours of the soth. ult. and 7th instant have 
both been received the last yesterday. - 

If nothing happens to prevent it, I will dispatch a 
light cart (not being disposed to lead the calf the whole 
distance this warm, weather for Mr, Lloyds present, 
and two or three sheep from Mr. Gough if he has of the 
sort I want, to dispose of. The cart will leave this on 
Monday, and probably be at Baltimore on Tuesday. 

In the meantime, if you should perchance see Mr. 
Gough you would do me a favour to ask if he has of the 
cape sheep kind one of which he would recommend for 
trading not the broad tail sherp is the kind I want 
if he has a ram, and one or two ewe Lambs of his best I 
would take, at his own price If he has none my cart 
would have no occasion to proceed there. 

For your kind attention to my late request I pray 
you to accept my thanks and with great esteem & 
regard I am Dr. Sir 

Yr. Obedt. Servt,

To NATHL. RAMSAY, Esq. 

MOUNT VERNON, i3th. Aug., 1797. 
Sir, 

Having occasion to send a light carriage to Balti- 
more, I have directed the person (Mr. Jno. Anderson of 
my Manager) who has charge of it, to call upon you & 
get a ram, and two ewe lambs of the Cape (broad tail) 
sharp if you have any to dispose of, & such as you would 
recommend for breeding. 

I want them on account of the mutton, and if the 
ram was of the size & age to serve a score or more ewes 
this season, it would be desirable. If Mr. Anderson 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 219 

succeeds in his application for these sheep, the cost of 
them shall be paid to your order on demand. 
I am Sir 

Your Most Obedient and Very Hble. Servant, 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To HENRY D. GOUGH, Esq. 

MOUNT VERNON, i$th Augt., 1797. 
Dear Sir: 

The bearer, Mr. Jno. Anderson, son of my Manager, 
(with a light carriage) is sent for the calf from the 
Eastern Shore, and the sheep mentioned in my last, 
if Mr. Gough has them to spare. If you have not seen 
that Gentleman, and learnt that Anderson's going to 
him would be fruitless, he is directed to proceed with 
the letter of which he is possessed for Mr. Gough. 

I would thank you for causing the enclosed adver- 
tisement to be inserted three times with the interval of 
a week between each the expence of which I will pay 
the Printer as soon as it is made known to me. Mrs. 
Washington is greatly distressed & fatigued from the 
want of such a character as I am inviting. 

Does the Baltimore Telegraph come under the de- 
scription of a Democratic or Repub. ? or what is its 
character & reputn.

MOUNT VERNON, i4th, Augt., 1797, 
Sir, 

Your favor of the i?th ulto. came safe, but a good 
while after date. For the sermons you had the good- 
ness to send me 1 pray you to accept my thanks. The 
doctrine in them is sound, and does credit to the 
author. 



220 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

It does, indeed, give me pleasure to have such, sen- 
timents as Mr. Curtis has expressed to you, transmitr 
ted to me; and it would render Mm and all his friends 
an acceptable service if in your letters to him you would 
endeavor to stimulate his pride to impress upon his 
mind the advantages to be derived from education and 
the wishes of his friends that he may turn out a finished 
scholar and finally that this is no otherwise to be 
accomplished than by close application and a contin- 
uation at college. 

To overcome an indolent temper, amusements at 
present innocent but unprofitable and to excite him to 
exert the talent which he possesses constitute the 
difficulty at present. By & by, perhaps, bad example, 
or the advice of dissipated young men, may increase it 
considerably. He has, I know, a friendship and re- 
gard for you, and I am persuaded your opinion on these 
topics would have a happy effect. With esteem & re- 
gard, 

I am Sir 
Your Most Obedt. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 

To The REVD. MR. ZACHARIAH LEWIS- 
MOUNT VERNON i4th. August 1797 
Dear Sir, 

Not having anything to communicate of sufficient 
moment to give you the trouble of receiving a letter 
from me, I have delayed until now to acknowledge the 
receipt of your favors of the loth. & 2 5th. Ulto. 

When I left Philadelphia, Mr. Lear and Mr. Dan- 
dridge who remained, were directed to dispose of my 
Household furniture (such parts I mean as were not 
packed for a removal to this place) but from some 
misapprehension the ornaments of my dining Table, 
& some Plated bottle Coolers, were not disposed of as 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 221 

was expected, but left in the care of Mr. McHenry 
(Secretary of War) subject to future orders, when they 
came away. 

I have now to request that you will receive these 
from him, and if you can, to dispose of them (one of 
the Coolers excepted, concerning which I will write 
to you sometime hence) on the best terms you can. It 
is not probable that any one, unless the Presidt. or 
any of the foreign Ministers should be so disposed, 
would take the whole of course to retail them, would 
be the most likely means of getting them off. 

The articles you will receive, if I mistake not, will 
consist of two four bottle coolers. A Platteau in nine 
pieces. three large groups with glasses over them, two 
vases, and twelve small single figures of Porcelain. 

The Invoice of the Platteaux I am unable, at present, 
to come at, but that of the figures is enclosed, as is the 
one which contains the cost of the Coolers which were 
never used there being four, originally, and two 
were quite sufficient to answer my purposes. I do not 
expect, notwithstanding they are new, that the one 
offered for Sale will fetch the cost, and the other things, 
I am certain will fall much below it, as they have not 
only been used, but the Porcelain in some of its nicest 
parts, is injured ; although I have not been able to 
find the cost of the Platteaux, I have a memorandum 
which informs me that they stand me in 486 Livres 
in Pans exclusive of all the subsequent charges of 
transportation from thence to Havre, original insur- 
ance, duty to the United States. 

I send the Invoices for the satisfaction of yourself, 
and my wife may be inclined to purchase. when this 
purpose is answered they may be returned to me, 

Will you be so good as to ask Mr. Dobson if there 
are no more Volumes of the American Edition of the 
Encyclopaedia out: the i6th. is the last I have re- 



222 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

ceived, and inform him at the same time that it is 
my wish that my second sett (for I subscribed for two 
setts to encourage his undertaking the work) be neatly 
bound and sent to me, having given away the sett in 
boards. 

With esteem & regard I am

MOUNT VERNON i4th. Augt. 1797 
Dear Sir, 

It is a little out of time, to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter of the pth. ulto. ; but better late than 
never: and one object in doing it, is to pray you to 
thank Mr. Bordly in my name, for the work he had 
the goodness to send me, through the channel of your 
conveyance. 

I presume the affair of Mr. Bloust will lye dormant 
until the Committee of Congress make report at the 
ensuing Session. It will be to be regretted, much, if 
this business is not probed to the bottom. That 
Government may not sleep and be forgotten in the 
meantime. I perceive Mr. Morse has opened a Battery 
against it, but if his subsequent fire does no more in- 
jury than the first, his artillery will recoil upon him- 
self. 

It had escaped me, until reminded by a re-perusal 
of your first letters, that my Table ornaments & Coolers 
were in your possession. Not for the value of the 
thing, but as a token of my friendship, and as a remem- 
brance of it, I ask you, Colonel Pickering & Mr. Wolcott 
to accept each one of the two* bottle coolers the other 
articles I pray you to have carefully packed (the por- 
celain in fine sawdust) and sent to Colo. Biddle, who 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 223 

will be directed what to do with them & will pay the 
cost of packing. 

What is the character of Porcupine's Gazette? I 
had thought when I left Philadelphia of ordering it to 
be sent to nae ; then again I thought it best not to do it, 
and altho' I should like to see both his & Bache's 
The Aurora, the latter may, under all circumstances, 
be the best decision, I mean not subscribing to either 
of them. 

Mrs. Washington & Miss Custis thanks you for your 
kind remembrance of them, and join with me in best 
regards for Mrs. McHenry and yourself and family. 
With much truth I am 

Your sincere friend and 

affectionate Servant 
G. WASHINGTON. 

P. S. I shall rely on you to present the Coolers in 
my name to the Gentlemen above named.

JAMES McHENRY, Esqr. 

MOUNT VERNON, 20 Augt., 1797. 

Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 2 ad. of May last, 
from Belfast; and wish it was in my power to give 
you a more satisfactory statement of the deed. Mrs. 
Savage's affairs in this country than I am about to 

detail. 

True it is I was one of that unfortunate lady's trus- 
tees, and as true, that while I was in a situation ^to 
render her any services I performed them (jointly with 
the other trustee) as far, and as fast as the tedious 
delays of our Courts would suffer justice to be admin- 
istered. 

But from the year 1774 until the beginning of the 
year 1 784, it was not in my power to attend to hers, or 



224 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

any private concern, of my own being absent from this 
State (Virginia) eight years of the time; during the 
whole of which, and for sometime after, I believe there 
was a suspension of all law, and all justice, except such 
as proceeded from a sense of honour, the last of which 
was no trait in the character of Doctr. Savage, husband 
of the Lady, for of all ingrates he was the most ungrate- 
ful 

While alive, and the Courts were open, he had re- 
course to all the chicanery of Law, and all the subter- 
fuge of Lawyers to avoid paying her annuity, and since 
his death, his Estate, if any, for there are various opin- 
ions concerning it, and much contention arising there- 
from, would render it uncanded were I not to add, es- 
pecially as the heirs of his Security (also dead) have 
pleaded the want of associates that it is my opinion, 
strengthened by the Report of the Revd. Mr. Fairfax, 
the other Trustee (who I believe has done all that cir- 
cumstances would permit) that little is to be expected 
from the prosecution of this business. 

The Suit is still going on, but without sufficient 
means to support it from hence, and the circumstances 
already mentioned it has too much the appearance of 
throwing away good money after bad, to proceed. So 
far as I have an individual interest in the matter the 
hope of a return of the money which I advanced Mrs. 
Savage in her distress, when it was not in the power of 
her Trustees to force payment of the annuity and other 
expenditures in common with Mr. Fairfax has van- 
ished long since. 

Having but lately returned home from a second 
eight years absence, which with many interruptions 
for pubHc purposes between which has prevented my 
talcing any active share in this business for upwards of 
twenty years, I have given it as my opinion to Mr. 
Fairfax, that it would be best to offer a percentage, or 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 225 

a good fee to the lawyers prosecuting the suit for the 
claimants tinder Mrs. Savage's Will, for all they cart 
recover on this account; and to receive nothing unless 
they do, by way of stimula to their executions : what 
effect this will have, or whether any, remains to be de- 
cided. 

I am,

Sir, 

Your letter of the sd.instt. came duly to hand, and I 
wish with all my heart you would meet with such em- 
ployment as your talents are suited to ; but if you can- 
not obtain this in Philadelphia where your character is 
best known, it is not likely you would succeed better 
where you are less acquainted, and in places less pop- 
ulous. 

There is none within my view, in this quarter, in any 
of the lines to which you allude; and if you look for 
anything in a public way you are already in the best 
situation to make the application with a prospect of 
success, as the President will, unquestionably, require 
the best testimonials that can be obtained of your 
fitness for Office and these can only be had from those 
to whom you are known. If you are pleased to send

MOUNT VERNON, 2 3rd. Augt., 1797. 
Sir, 

I feel, sensibly, your kind & polite attention to me, 
in the presentation of a bull calf of your improved 
breed, A very fine one indeed, it is, and merits my 
particular thanks, which I pray you to accept. 

My stock of all sorts has been much neglected dur- 
ing my eight years' residence from home, and will take 
more time than in the usual course of nature will be 
allowed me, to improve that much^ but with the means 
you have been so good as to furnish me, and other aids, 
I shall, by proper attention put my black cattle into a 
way of improvement. 

I am sorry to hear of the disease & consequent de- 
generacy of your sheep. Before I left home in the 
Spring of 1789 I had improved that species of my stock 
so much as to get 5 J Ibs of Wool as the average of the 
fleeces of my whole flock, and at the last shearing 
they did not yield me 2 ^ Ibs. By procuring (if I am 
able,) good rams and giving the necessary attention, I 
hope to get them up again for they are with me, as you 
have declared them to be with you, that part of my 
stock in which I most delight. With esteem & regard 
I have the honor to be

MOUNT VERNON, ist. Sept., 1797. 

Your letter of the 3oth of July has been received, but 
not until within the last three days, Your judgment 
bond was long before sent to Mr. Ross to bring suit on. 
What he has done in the matter I know not, 

- To sue, cannot be more unpleasant and disagreeable 
to you, than it is to me ; but as the want of money, and 




THIRD WIFE OF TOBIAS LEAR 

(Frances Dandridge Henley) 

Also a niece of Martha Washington, and it was to her that the quilt 
shown in the other illustration, was given 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 227 

a punctual payment of it, were the only motives to sell 
my lands in the Counties of Fayette & Washington, so 
a disappointment in these must defeat the objects 
which I had in view; and has been because of the pro- 
secution to which I have resorted. 

You would not be unacquainted with the nature of 
your contract for the land in Fayette County, nor with 
the tenor of your Judgment Bond, given to fulfil it: 
of course, you must have known the amount of the 
sums as they became due and that they were to be paid 
at the Bank of Pennsylvania on a certain day, by In- 
stalments ; why then would you trust to others to do 
your business ; and by sending a little money by this, 
and a little by that man who knew not what to do with 
it when they got to Philadelphia, hazard the disappoint- 
ments which followed? especially as that mode of pay- 
ment was purposely guarded against in the contract, 
as one from whence I could derive no substantial bene- 
fit; Whereas regular payments in the manner Colo, 
Richie has made them would have given me (although 
the land sold low) all the advantages I expected to de- 
rive, from the sale of the lands. 

Not knowing what Mr. Ross has done in the prem- 
ises, I know not what further to say in reply to your 
letter. If the arrearages are paid up, with interest to 
the time they became due, and the instalments reg- 
ularly discharged afterwards, agreeably to the condi- 
tions of your Bond, it is all I require and all I can wish ; 
for far is it, from my desire to embarrass, or injure 
your character by a Law suit; but if punctuality is 
not observed on your part a suit for the reasons I have 
already assigned will be the inevitable consequence. 
And I do now, in explicit terms declare that it may be 
of no avail to see that such an one is to pay so much, 
toother so much, and so on I shall have nothing to do 
with any of them; because I shall expect each years

whom I would give the trouble of receiving money, nor 
do I want partial sums lodged, there. The amount of

Sir, 

Your letter of the 25th. ulto. came to hand by the 
last Post. 

The ground Rent of the lot I have offered to lease in 
Alexandria, is three dollars a foot, for what it measures 
on each street. This I must obtain as an annual Rent

MOUNT VERNON, 4th. Septr., 1797. 
Sir, 

I am going to take a liberty with you, for which I 
rely more on your goodness, than on any excuse I can 
make, for pardon. 

A person of the name of Anthony Hensler, a Ger- 
man (in the vicinity of Baltimore) has offered himself 
to me as a Gardener,- He professes to understand that 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 229 

business in all its branches, and well in each, represent- 
ing himself moreover as a person of some property, and 
very sober. He adds that, his wife (about his own age) 
is a very decent woman, and capable of the duties of 
a Housekeeper . 

Such characters would be useful to me at this time ; 
but I told Mr. Hensler that I would not employ stran- 
gers, in either of those capacities, without ample tes- 
timonials of their qualifications; and with respect to 
himself that they must go to these points. i. Skill in 
the line of his profession 2. Honesty 3, Sobriety 
4. moral character, generally. 5, orderly deport- 
ment and 6. industry, for although I usually employed 
two or three negroes under my hired Gardener it 
was not for the purpose of exempting the latter from 
manual labour* 

T?or information respecting these matters he has re- 
ferred me to you; (who he says has a knowledge of 
him from his having lived on some estate of yours, 
On this ground then it is, I am induced to ask the fav- 
our of you to give me the character of Mr. Hensler. 
It is not easy to conceive that his wife, to whom accord- 
ing to his own account he has been married upward of 
20 years can, from the station she has filled, without 
having previously acquired it, be well qualified for 
keeping such a house as mine but if she is neat in her 
person, sensible, active, honest & spirited; and poss- 
esses any knowledge in cookery, she might be very use- 
ful to Mrs. Washington notwithstanding. 

I must again pray your excuse for the trouble this 
application must give and request that I may as soon 
as is convenient, hear from you on this subject. 
I am Sir, 

Your Most Obedt. Hble. Servt.

230 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

MOUNT VERNON in VIRGINIA 

1 5th, Septr. 1797. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the i2tfcu of May has been received, 
but not until within these few days: to which you 
will please to consider the following as a reply. 

Having been long in public life, and but little in this 
State for the last five and twenty years; and more- 
over, having had but very little agency in the Admin- 
istration of the deceased Colo. Thomas ColviTs affairs, 
even antecedant thereto, no consideration short of being 
the surviving Executor of his Will and the imperious 
necessity occasioned thereby of bringing matters to a 
close, could possibly have induced me to resume any 
agency therein. 

Under these circumstances however, I have at all 
times, of late, when it was in my power, used my best 
endeavors to have the accounts closed, in order to 
ascertain the surplus which that Gentleman had 
bequeathed to the nearest relations of his mother, of 
the names of Stott, Wills, Richardson and Catherine 
Smith, of Durham; or their descendants: and with 
much difficulty and the aid of a Gentleman (Mr. Keith) 
well acquainted with this sort of business, have ac- 
complished it, as you see by having recourse to a 
notification in the London Gazette of December last, 
consequent of a decree of the high Court of Chancery 
in this State. 

The persons just named, or those claiming under 
them, may, perhaps be disappointed at the smallness 
of the sum viz nine hundred and thirty two pounds, 
seventeen shillings and seven pence three farthings, 
estimating dollars at Six shillings; which upon the 
final settlement was found to be the surplusage of the 
Testators estate after his Debts and specified legacies 
were discharged; but if they will advert to the clause 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON . 

of the Will tinder which they claim, & which was 
published in England many years ago, there ought 
not to be any surprise, as it there appears that the 
Testator himself was in doubt whether there would be 
any overplus estate. 

The reason why that sum (now actually in the Bank 
of Alexandria) was submitted to the decision and 
disposition of the Chancellor was, because there had 
been so many claims exhibited ; so vague a nature ; 
and some of them accompanied by such unjust and 
indecent insinuations, that I did not incline to inquire 
into the merits of the respective claims, or to become 
responsible for the distribution of the money. All 
those who have pretensions under the Will to a share 
in the beforementioned sum, will now know where I 
have sent their proofs; & to receive an order for their 
proportion of the Devise, having nothing more to do 
in the matter myself. I am Sir 

Your Obedient Hble Servt. 
MR. GEO. PEARSON. G. WASHINGTON. 

MOUNT VERNON, iSthSepr. 1797. 

Mr. Hensler, 

I should have written to you at an earlier period, but 
for the following reasons. 

First, because as I informed you, I had written to 
Scotland for a complete gardener under indentures ; and 
expected every day to learn the result of my appli- 
cation. i COU H not therefore, enter into engagements 
with another without hazarding a disappointment toone 
of the parties ,or a surplusage of men in that line, which 
would have been useless, and inconvenient to myself 
and secondly, because I requested you not to forego any 
other plan you might have in contemplation, while I re- 
mained in the state of incertitude I had expressed to 
you. 



232 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

I have now, -within a day or two, received a letter 
from the Gentleman to whom I applied in Scotland, 
to engage me a Gardener, promising that he wd. 
endeavour to comply with my request, & hoped he 
should succeed; thus, the matter stands on uncertain 
ground yet. 

The presumption however is, that a few weeks will 
decide whether I am to receive a Gardener from Scot- 
land, or not: If the latter, I will delay no time in 
giving you notice thereof, and will accompany the 
communication with the specific terms on which I 
would employ you : which, if you shd. be disengaged 
at the time,, will require no other answer than yea or 
nay. 

I can only repeat now, what I said to you when you 
were here last, that from the circumstances I am under, 
& the uncertainty of the case, it is not my wish, or de- 
sire that you should avoid any employment worthy of 
your acceptance, in expectation of getting into my 
service. T remain, 

Your friend &ca.

Sir 9 - 

I have examined my land papers, but find I possess 
none which relate to my purchase from Mr. Simon 
Peason, all of them having been turned over, with 
my transfer, to Mr. Lund Washington. 

I can form no idea of what Graften Kirt &ca. are to 
exhibit in evidence on this occasion. I sincerely be- 
lieve that all the proceedings in, & docMtig of, the en- 
tail of the land to which Mr. Thos. Pearson now sets up 
a claim, were strictly conformable to law, and of more 
validity than Grafton's testimony; whose character; 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 

if I have not an erroneous impression of it, is not 
immaculate, but so much the reverse, as to be a ready 
witness upon all occasions. Nothing suggests itself 
to my mind as ground on which a suit can be instituted, 
unless it be alledged, that some of the Jurors were not 
freeholders a thing I never have heard surmised, and 
strange indeed to be proved, five & thirty years after 
their verdict was given and (as I presume) admitted to 
record. 

The Deeds, if well drawn, do, no doubt recite the 
case, & names of the Jurors. but admitting the fore- 
going mistake in the Sheriff, would a Court of equity 
suffer an innocent purchaser to sustain an injury from 
the misconception or inattention of that Officer to his 
duty? I think not. 

You told me on Saturday that Simon Pearson left no 
legitimate children, and that his Brother Thomas was 
the lawful, heir, but to whom has 'descended or rather 
to whom bid Simon (if he left a will) bequeath his 
Estate? For if there be any irregularity in the process 
of docking the Entail, and Thos, should, which I think 
not at all likely, recover the land for which he is con- 
tending, that estate must be resorted to: I cannot 
surely be in possession of Thomas, for in that case the 
contest wdi be 'with himself, because lie wd. have to 
pay for all he obtained. 

When you know the result of the evidence you are 
summoned to hear, I stud, be glad to be informed of 
it & with esteem 

I am Sir

Sir, 

I have already erected a threshing machine on Mr. 



234 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

Booker's plan, and was on the point of putting up one 
or two more when I received a letter from a Gentleman 
of my acquaintace informing me that you had invented 
one which did more execution with less force. This 
has induced me to suspend the erection of those on 
Mr. Booker's plan, until I can receive better inform- 
ation relative to yours, and this is the cause of my 
giving you the trouble of receiving this letter and 
praying that you would be so obliging as to give it. 

The advantage which Mr. Booker has over the Scotch 
machine (which I never saw) lyes, it is said, in being 
less expensive, & less complex particularly in the sub- 
stitution of a band in place of cogs & rounds ; which, as 
I have understood, with the expense thereof, is the 
principal objection to the latter. 

Not having heard whether you have obtained a 
Patent, lor the invention of yours, or mean to apply for 
one, I would not have it understood that my application 
for information into the principle on which yours act 
the power which works it or the execution is cal- 
culated to deprive you of any benefit which might re- 
sult in either case. 

The object of my enquiry is merely to know whether 
yours (nothing being more interesting to the farmer) 
is upon a simple plan & not easily put out of order in 
the hands of ignorant negroes & careless overseers, 
whether cheap, & easily erected, what the execution, 
and with what force it is worked; together with the 
manner of working it and the house proper for its re- 
ception. 

If in these particulars, on a fair comparison with Mr. 
Booker's it obtains a preference, I shall certainly, as 
I am about to provide conveniences of this sort for 
getting my erect yours instead of his ; and 

whether built by my own people or others I am willing 
to allow the Patent fee if it exists, or to stand upon the 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 235 

same footing that others do to avail myself of the best 
discovery in this or any other country to effect so val- 
uable an end. Your answer to these queries would 
very much oblige me as ulterior measures depend upon 
them & my want of machines to get my grain out in a 
clean and expeditious mode I hope you will have the 
goodness to excuse the liberty I have herein taken and 
to believe that I am Sir

I have duly received yottr several letters of last

duct & behaviour of young Curtis would avail nothing 
I shall not trouble you by the attempt. 

I am persuaded that your conduct towards him has 
been such as friendship inspired, and the duties of your 
important truth required* And as you have seen, in a 
degree, what my solicitude advice & admonition have 
been, he will have himself only to upbraid for any con- 
sequences which may follow and this perhaps comes 
too late. 

By Mr. La Fayette who is on his way to New York 
to embark for Prance, I send you bank notes to the 
amount of $100 in discharge of the balance of the acct. 
transmitted (65) the twenty advanced Mr. Curtis

Dear Sir, 

In answering your favor of the 28th, ulto. which 
has been duly received I wish it was in my power to 
give you more satisfactory information than you will 
find, in this letter relative to the land near Suffolk. 

Some years ago (before, if my memory serves me, I 
was called to administer the Government of the U. 
States) Mr. John Lewis, as Executor of his father, Colo. 
Fielding Lewis. Will, informed me that the circum- 
stances of that estate required that his father's interest 
in the lands wch, were bought by him, your father & 
myself, lying as above, should be sold. In reply, I 
told him that any bargain for it that Doctr. Walker & 
himself -would make, I would abide by. Since which 
I have never lieard a tittle from either on this subject 
nor do I know in whose possession, or under what or- 
cumstances tte lands now are. That they are not 
sold I am inclined to believe, because the title papers 
are still in my care, & no application has ever been 
made for them,

MOUNT VERNON, isth. Oct., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

The Fish you had the goodness to send me arrived very 
safe; and are excellent. for your recollection of that 
request of mine, and the trouble you were at to obtain 
the best kind, I pray you to accept my grateful thanks. 

The money, as you desired, was paid to Captn. Silver, 
to the amount of your memorandum of their cost, and 
they shall be stored, & dressed agreeably to the direc- 
tions contained in your letter, forgiving which I feel 
myself obliged. 

No man wishes more devoutly than I that a stop was 
put to the further effusion of blood ; that harmony was 
restored to all nations, and that justice was done to 
ours ; but I must confess that my hope of seeing these 
accomplished soon, exceed my expectation. The af- 
fairs of Europe seem to me to be in so purturbed a state 
and the views of the principal actors so discordant 
that it is not easy on rational principles and fair cal- 
culation to predict events. 

Nothing is wanting in ourselves to steer clear of the 
vortex of misery, which has brought so many of the 
nations of Europe to the brink of ruin in this desol- 
ating war, but unanimity; and if a steady adherence 
to the principles which have hitherto directed our 
councils is unable to effect this, it will nevertheless I 
hope avert the evils which, otherwise might be expec- 
ted to flow from the persevering opposition which is 
levelled at our government; and all those who stand 
forward in support of it. This is my creed, and I shall 
believe in it until the contrary is verified, which Heaven 
revert! Adieu, with very great esteem and regard I

MOUNT VERNON 15 Octr, 1797. 
Revd. Sir, 

Your favour of the 2oth of Feb. has been received, 
and I am indebted to you for many other unacknowl- 
edged letters. The trouble is, I soon found after, 
entering upon the duties of my late public stations 
that private correspondencies did not accord with 
official duties: and as I determined to perform the 
latter to the best of my abilities, I early relinquished 
the former, when business was not the subject of them. 

It might be asked, why suffer the letter of the 2oth. 
of February (which is of the latter description) to 
remain unacknowledged after I had, months past, 
bid advice in my public walks? The answer is easy; 
an eight years' absence from home (excepting 
short occasional visits) had so deranged my private 
affairs; had so despoiled my buildings; and in a 



24 o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

word, had thrown my domestic concerns in to such 
disorder, as at no period of my life have I been more 
engaged than in the last six months, to recover & 
put them into some tolerable train again. 

Workmen in most countries, I believe, are necessary 
plagues; in this where entreaties as well as money 
must be used to obtain their work, and keep them to 
their duty, they baffle all calculation in the accom- 
plishment of any plan, or repairs they are engaged in ; 
and require more attention to, & looking after, than 
can well be conceived. Numbers of these, of all 
descriptions, having been employed by me ever since 
I came home (to render my situation comfortable 
the ensuing winter) has allowed me little leisure for 
other occupations, 

Rural employments while I am spared (which in 
the natural course of things cannot be long) will now 
take place of toil responsibility and the sollici- 
tudes attending the walks of public life; and with 
vows for the peace, the happiness & prosperity of a 
country in whose service the prime of my life hath 
been spent, and with best wishes for the tranquility 
of all Nations, and all men, the scene will close ; grateful 
to that Providence which has directed my steps, & 
shielded me in the various changes & chances through 
which I have passed, from my youth to the present 
moment. 

I scarcely know what you allude to in your letter 
of the aoth of Feby. when you say " I observed in the 
Philadelphia papers mention made of a volume of 
your epistles, domestic, confidential & official" unless 
it be the spurious letters which issued from a certain 
Voss in New York during the War, with .a view to 
destroy the confidence which the army and community 
might have had in my political principles ; and which 
have lately been republished with greater avidity & 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 241, 

perseverance than ever, by Mr. Vache, to answer the 
same nefarious purpose with the letters* 

I supposed every attack that was made upon my 
Executive conduct (the one just mentioned among the 
sett) to pass unnoticed while I remained in public 
office; well knowing that if the general tenor of it 
would not stand the test of investigation, a newspaper 
vindication would be of little avail. But as immense 
pains has been taken by this said Mr;. Vache, who is 
no more than the agent or tool of those who are en- 
deavoring to destroy the confidence of the people 
in the officers of Government (chosen by themselves) 
to dessiminate those counterfait letters, I conceived 
it a piece of justice due to my own character, and to 
Posterity, to disavow them in explicit terms; and 
this I did in a letter directed to the Secretary of State 
to be fil&d in his office the day on which I closed my 
administration. This letter has since been published 
in the Gazette by the head of that Department: 

With respect to your own request, I can say nothing, 
so many things are continually given to the public 
of which I have no previous knowledge nor time 
indeed to inspect them if I tad been therewith in- 
formed that I may mistake the meaning of it. The 
late Secretary of State (now Vice^Preside&t) per- 
mitted a Mr. Levy my consent being first obtained 
to take copies under his inspection of the letters I had 
written to Congress; which letters have since been 
published and are I presume genuine, and must be 
those which you refer to. But as they are the work 
of another, who is now in England on this business, 
I cannot suppose that you, had it IB contemplation to 
derive a benefit from his labours. I shall only add 
therefore that discretion in matters of this sort must 
be your guide without a Yea or nay from me. 

For Politics I shall refer you to the Gazette, of this

Sir, 

The enclosed letter from Mr. Brooks your brother, to 
Mr. Anderson my Manager (who were acquainted) is the 
best apology I can offer for giving you the trouble of re- 
ceiving one from me. 

It is the wish of Mrs. Washington that Mrs. Forbes, 
would without delay, repair to this place with her 
clothes &ca. where (if she has been an acceptable and 
competent housekeeper to you, while you filled the 
chair of Government of this State) there can be little 
doubt of her answering our purposes and will be re- 
tained on the terms mentioned in my advertisement 
which was inserted in a Richmond Paper. 

If Mrs. Forbes comes in the stage, which I presume 
will be the case, she might stop at the Widon Lund 
Washington's (close on the Road between Colchester & 
Alexandria) who will either send her hither, or let us 
know that she is there. 

A previous knowledge of the characters, one has to 
do with, being of some importance, you would do me a

prefer it) that of Mrs. Forbes. Besides care ; & a know-

MOUNT VERNON, 3oth Oct., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favors of the 3oth of August and 8th. of Septem- 
ber have remained unacknowledged, because I had 
nothing to communicate that could compensate for the 
loss of a moment of your time, which I know is too 
much occupied in matters of business to be interrupted 
by unimportant letters. 

Having received the enclosed letter by the Ganges, 
in the twilight, and attending to the first part of the su- 
perscription only, I broke the seal before I discovered 
that it was of a public nature. And the direction of the 
Spanish letter being somewhat equivocal, I send it also ; 
as well, for that reason as because I could not read it 
after it was opened, both to be disposed as you shall 
see fit. 

I thank you for sending me your answer to the very 
improper letter of Mr. de Grujo, who merited less re- 
spectful treatment. The copying press came safe, but 
does not work well ; whether for want of more springs 
I am unable to determine. Having a small one (which 
used to be getting out of order frequently, but at pres- 
ent does tolerably well) I do not use it at all. Should 
the smaller one fail, I will send the other, and ask you 
to have its defects rectified.

to recruits, for the army, I know not what reply to 
make. 

Matters of that sort, I never had anything to do 
with, as Commander in Chief of the American Army ; 
and never having speculated in any Soldiers certificate, 
or Rights of any kind or nature whatsoever, I am, 
perhaps, as little competent to give an opinion thereon

I am Sir 

Your very Hble Servant

MR. JACOB VALENTINE. 

MOUNT VERNON, 3 Nov., 1797. 
Sir, 

I shall preface this letter in answer to yours of yes- 
terday, with a declaration as sincere as It is solemn, 



246 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

and that is, that if it was in my power, I would take no 
advantage of you in the proposed exchange of Lands ; 
nor would I wish you to make a bargain with me that 
either you yourself or your friends (such I mean as are 
competent judges) should hereafter say was disadvan- 
tageous on your part : for be assured I should derive 
no pleasure from a contract of which you might have 
just cause to complain. 

Having made this declaration, it remains to be added, 
that both of us may err in the comparative value of our 
respective lands. You, perhaps, proceed upon what 
you conceive to be the present selling price of such lands 
as yours are, in this country, which, abstractedly is 
fair ; but if I mistake not, lands here are not only at a 
stand, but on the decline ; while on the other hand, I go 
on a thorough conviction in my own mind, that such as 
I offer in exchange and which in some instances / know, 
and in all believe are of the first rate, will increase. 
I form this opinion from analogous circumstances; 
for since I have been an actor for myself, Frederick and 
Berkeley courtier were deemed much more remote & 
in fact out of the inhabited world that the Kajihawa 
is now : and land, which I then bought in the former 
at five pounds per hundred acres, and the highest (on 
account of small improvements) at twenty five pound, 
per hundd. I could now sell, very readily at five pounds 
an acre. But this is digressing from the point, and I 
will return to it again, after making one more obser- 
vation which in my opinion is literally true & impor- 
tant namely that it is not the number of acres you 
receive in exchange for your land, that is to render that 
exchange valuable, there are a great many local con- 
siderations which must contribute to this. I aver, 
most seriously, that I wd. not give my tract of 10990 
acres on the Kanhawa for 50,000 acres back of it, & 
adjoining thereto, nor for any 50,000 acres of the 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 247 

common land of the country, which I have seen, back 
from the water, & in one body.- And I have no doubt 
but that the land immediately back of mine might now 
be bought for half a dollar or less pr. which and on acct. 
of the extensive range that cannot for series of years be 
interrupted, renders these bottoms so extremely val- 
uable. 

In offering you three of my tracts on the Kanhawa, 
containing together 12,276 acres for yoir sugar land 
tracts entire, I conceived I was by no means deficient 
in proposing an equivalent, especially as these three 
tracts would have given you a boundary on the Rivers 
of near 25 miles, of the richest low ground in that ctry. 

It is true and so I informed you that I had never been 
on either of these tracts and have only the Surveyors 
report and other information on which to form my 
opinion of the quality of the land. They may be less, 
or they may be more valuable than the lower tract for 
ought I know to the contrary. Two reasons however, 
induced me to reserve the latter. ist a knowledge of 
the tract from my own inspection of it because it was 
the lowest on that River and not more than 3 miles 
from Mount Pleasant. A place which must, as soon as 
tranquillity is perfectly restored be of considerable im- 
portance from its situation at the junction of two im- 
portant Rivers running in different directions through 
so large and fertile a tract of country. 

This letter is written not with a view to exculpate 
myself from any suspicion which might arise of my not 
meaning to offer you an equivalent for your land, that 
from any expectation I entertain of our coming to a 
bargain, for it can hardly be supposed that I would al- 
low the whole of my lands to be picked, whilst the most 
valuable part of yours (or your sons) is reserved. If 
however, upon reconsidering the matter you should be 
disposed to let the island go with, and become part of

the exchanged lands, I will, on my part (as you have 
expressed a wish to make an exchange) consent to part 
with my lower tract on the Kanhawa also ; and if there 
is any likelihood of our agreeing on a just proposition of 
quantity and value of my land for yours, I would on 
some early day which you may name (before the weath- 
er gets cold) ride up with you and your son (for I shd. 
like that he should be perfectly satisfied before hand 
with whatever is done) and look at your Londoun 
lands having at present not the least knowledge of the 
quality of them, neither from investigation or infor- 
mation, and because which I frankly declare to you 
previously that it is not a trifling consideration that 
wd. induce me to part with my lower tract on the 
Kanhawa with the situation, local advantages, quality 
and value of which I have formed an opinion not 
from information but from my own accurate view 
not from information but from my own accurate view, 
having been on it three or four days and hunted from 
one end to the other of the bottom. 

Your answer to this letter will at once decide whether 
there be any prospect of our bargaining, or not and I 
should thank you for giving it to me as soon as it is 
convenient.

Dear Sir, 

Since writing to you a few days ago I have been 
favoured with your letters of the 2 6th. and 3oth. Ulto. 

If you should have occasion to write to Mr. Parish of 
Hamburg, you would oblige me by thanking him in my 
behalf, for his very polite & friendly offer of sending me

any tiling I might have occasion for from that place. 
It would be more formal than necessary, to introduce 
Mr. Bucknall Orchardist to the Philosophical Society 
of Philadelphia otherwise than through you. If then 
you will be so good as to relate the manner in which it 
came, & present it with my best respects to that body, 
I will thank you. With very great esteem & regard,

MOUNT VERNON, 6th. Nov., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favour of the 2d. ulto. with its enclosure came 
duly to hand, and I feel myself very much obliged by 
the favorable footing on which you have placed mat- 
ters with Colo. Shreve. These are perfectly satis- 
factory to me and of which I should have informed you 
sooner had I not supposed that the most certain though 
perhaps not the quickest way of making it known to 
you would be to lodge my letter in Philadelphia against 
your arrival there. This I am about to do in the hands 
of Colo. Pickering. Whatever mode, under the de- 
rangements occasioned by the sore calamity which has 
afflicted that City, you shall find most convenient to 
yourself, will be agreeable to me, for depositing the 
same in the Bank of Pennsylvania which has been paid 
you by Colo. Shreve on my acct. but it might not be 
amiss to add that the $500 have been paid into that 
Bank for my use, no advice of it has been given to me. 

I am perfectly convinced that your observations and 
opinion with respect to the most advantageous mode 
to wit laying off my lands on the Ohio into lots of 
about 200 acres is correct, and the best way to make the 
most of them. The reasons which have weighed against

it hitherto with me, are first it is troublesome, sd, 
may be tedious in its operation and 3d. my object being 
to convert the Land aggregately into money, on some 
kind of stock that I might derive a convenience & bene- 
fit from the interest during the short stay which from 
the natural course of things I have to remain here, the 
end would not be answered in a retail way without, in a 
manner, sinking the capital. But as you have been so 
good as to mention this mode will you permit me to ask 
what you think what the land would sell for by the acre 
divided in the manner you suggest and whatever 
there is within your view, any person in whom con- 
fidence could be placed as an Agent to manage this 
business, who has sense and inclination to undertake it 
for an adequate compensation? 

I wish you an agreeable Session and perfect unan- 
imity in all great questions which involve the dignity, 
honor and interest of our Country. With very sincere 
esteem & regard,

MOUNT VERNON, i3th. Nov., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

The running off of my cook, has been a most incon- 
venient thing to this family; and what renders it more 
disagreeable, is, that I had resolved never to become 
the master of another slave by purchase, but this resol- 
ution I fear I must break. 

I have endeavoured to hire, black or white, but am 
not yet supplied. A few days ago having occasion to 
write to Mr. Bushrod Washington on other matters, I 
asked if one could be had in Richmond, the following 
is his answer. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 251 

Mr. Brooke (late Governor) informs me that he had a 
very excellent cook, with no other fault than a fondness 
for liquor (which often afforded him too many oppor- 
tunities of indulging) who is now in Fredericksburg, 
and is to be sold. I shall write to the Gentleman who 
has him not to sell him till he hears from you. Should 
you under this character wish to buy, or hire him, please 
address a letter to Mr. George Murray of that place. 
He cooked for Mr. Brooke " while he was in the Govern- 
ment. " 

Let me ask you now, to see both Mr. Murray & the 
man himself and if upon conversing fully with the latter 
you should be of opinion (from the account he gives of 
himself) that he is a good cook, and would answer my 
purposes then discover the lowest terms on which he 
could be had by purchase or on hire ; & inform me of 
the result by the first Post so that an answer shall be 
immediately given. 

I should like to know the age and as far as you are 
enabled to ascertain it, the temper & looks of the man 
described. whether he has a wife, and expects to 
have her along with him and in that case, what 
children they have with her age & occupation. By the 
time I can receive an answer from you I expect Mrs. 
Forbes who was Genl. Brooks housekeeper will be here 
as my housekeeper ; and from her own knowledge of the 
person, and your account I shall be enabled to determine 
what answer to give. Our loves to Mrs. Lewis &ca. 
I am Your affecte. Uncle

MOUNT VERNON, 28th. Nov., 1797. 
Dear Sir, 

I have lately received a letter from a Mr. Small of 
Philadelphia, informing me that the coach I used in the

city was yet unsold, that it was accumulating ex- 
pence, and not more than two hundred dollars had 
been offered for it, when, according to his acct. $300 
was the value fixed thereon. 

I intended to have sent his letter to you, but it has 
been mislaid, or lost I shall beg the favour of you, 
however, to sell, or cause it to be sold, for whatever it 
will fetch. Who limited the price to $300 I know not, 
but took it for granted that it had been disposed of 
many a day ago. Receive, and place the proceeds to 
the credit of

MOUNT VERNON, 26th Feby., 1798. 
Dear Sir, 

When you were here last, I informed you that from 
the reputation which the College at Annapolis had, I 
was most inclined under every view I could take of the 
case, to send Washington to that Seminary ; and, ac- 
cordingly, had requested Mr. George Carteret (who 
informed me that he was going to that city) to converse 
with the President of the College on the subject & 
make other enquiries and to acquaint me with the 
result. 

Enclosed I transmit his letter. It wd. have been 
more pleasing, and much to have been desired to have 
got Washington 'fixed in the house with Mr. McDow- 
ell; but this it seems cannot be, for reasons assigned by 
that Gentleman. I think, notwithstanding, that he 
had best go there, as, from all accounts there is less of 
that class of people which are baneful to youth, in that 
City, than in any other, from the nature of its com- 
position, and strictness of its Police according to Mr, 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 253 

Calvert's account, and for another reason also seeing 
(as he confesses he has) what effect his misconduct 
has had upon his friends Pride, when classed with other 
students will operate in addition thereto, a more pow- 
erful stimulus, than it would in lonely, solitary reading 
& studies, by himself. 

If he was to get to Alexandria, his studies must be 
conducted at the Academy, or in his own chamber. 
The first, after coming from a large & celebrated college 
he would consider as degrading & in the other case (be- 
ing left alone) he would attend very little to them while 
Mr. Moffat was discharging the trust reposed in him at 
the Academy. To expect after devoting the appro- 
priate hours to his school boys that he wd. apply much 
of the residue to Washington is what he would not per- 
form, strictly, was he to promise it. And besides, from 
the information I have been enabled to obtain, the 
young People (those keeper clerks chiefly) are idle, dis- 
sipated and extravagant. Acquaintances with some of 
these would be soon formed, and the consequences not 
difficult to predict. From good authority I am in- 
formed that many of them spend in Taverns more than 
their wages amount to. The deficiency must be sup- 
plied in some way or another. 

With respect to his (Washington's) remaining at this 
place, I am perfectly satisfied from the experience of 
the last few months that he has been here, that even 
under the constant care of a more illumined Preceptor 
than I am sure there is the least chance of obtaining, 
he would progress very little, and as the case now is, 
that he will forget what he does know, so inert is his 
mind. 

He takes Alexandria in his way to Hope Park to pro- 
vide himself with such clothes as would be necessary. 
At what time they must be ready otherwise than by 
promise, The suggestion of your accompanying Wash-

ington to Annapolis is contained in Mr. Calvert's letter 
& coincides perfectly with my ideas of the utility of the 
measure. If it be convenient & agreeable to you to 
undertake the journey, you shall be informed when he 
is ready to commence it, or, if there could be any depen- 
dence upon the Tayler he could inform you himself. 
If you cannot go, I will ask Mr. Lear to do it, but this 
will not answer as well in either case the expense will 
be mine. 

Mrs. Washington has a very bad cold, the rest of the 
family at home as as usual. Best wishes to Mrs, 
Stuart and all with you.

MOUNT VERNON, lyth. Mar., 1798. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 28th. Ulto. came safe but was 
some time longer than might have been expected, on 
its way. 

As I think your charge for the prescription & applica- 
tion to Christopher (my servant) who was supposed to 
be bitten by a mad dog, is a very reasonable one, I send 
you enclosed a five dollar bank note of Alexandria 
(having no otnsr paper money by me) without enquir- 
ing whether your not having received four dollars be- 
fore, proceeded from the neglect of the Servant, or any 
other person. 

Christopher continues to do well, & I believe is now 
free from apprehension of any bad consequences from 
the bite. I shall beg to be informed of your receipt of 
this letter, being unwilling that you should go unpaid.

Dear Sir, 

I am not disposed to withdraw your attention from 
more important matters ; or to be troublesome in any 
degree; or to press my correspondence upon you. 
But not having even heard whether my letter of which 
the enclosed is taken, from a press copy ever reached 
your hands, am induced to make the enquiry. 

I wish also to know what has been done with a letter 
of mine, put under cover to you (early in March last) 
to be forwarded, or suppressed at your discretion, to a 
Mr. John Parkes who exhibited Proposals to the Pub- 
lic, for compiling a complete edition of all the Journals 
of Congress, from the earliest period of them down to 
the present day? With respect I am Dear Sir

MOUNT VERNON i6th July 1798 
Sir, 

I have received your letter of the i2th. Instant, 
and thank you for your offer of becoming one of my 
Aids~de-Camp. 

I have consented to accept the appointment to 
which my country has been pleased to call me, with 
the reservation not to quit my private walks until 
the army is in a situation to require my presence, or 
it becomes indispensable by the urgency of circum- 
stances. 

Until one, or the other of these periods shall have 
arrived, I shall make no actual appointment of my 
Aids; and as circumstances and a variety of con- 
siderations are required in regulating my choice, I 
must remain perfectly free and unengaged till then 
unless it should otherwise happen in a public interest.

Intoxicated and lost as the French seem to 
our principle of Justice, I yet hope that they will 
pause before they proceed further. That they have 
been misled and have made calculations on false

Independance of the Government of their having 
at every hazard sufficiently evinced. When to this 
happy circumstance, the issue then is added, & fully 
made known to them I can hardly conceive (although 
I think them capable of any thing that is unjust and 
dishonourable) that they will attempt a serious In- 
vasion of this Country. At the same time the highest

prepared for the events as they may affect our means 
to avert the evil. With esteem

MOUNT VERNON, $th Aug., 1798. 
My dear Sir, 

My present want of a riding horse is great, but if 
I should be called to the field it will be much greater. 

As I am much out of the way of seeing, or hearing of 
such as would answer my purposes especially in the 
latter case and know that you are a good judge of 
the parts, and general symmetry of a horse of figure. 
You would do me a favour if such a one as hits your own 
taste should fall in your way to buy him for me. The 
cost to be paid on delivery. 

In age, I should not be willing to exceed Seven years 
eight at most younger, but not under four last Spring 
would be better. For colour, I will not contend, but 
would prefer a perfect white, & dapple grey a deep 
bay a chestnut a black in the order they are men-

tioned. The size & strength must be equal to my 
weight, which without the saddle may be estimated at 
210 Ibs. Being long legged, or tall would be no re- 
commendation, as it adds nothing to strength, but a 
good deal to the convenience in mounting. 

Under my circumstances, I cannot limit you in sum; 
but shall add that I never expected to be Master of a 
riding horse that was almost more than four hundred 
dollars. 

As I have no idea that Mr. David Randolph (being on a 
journey) would would have parted with the horse he 
thought might have suited me, I took but little notice 
of him ; which I have been sorry for since and he is not 
within reach now. I asked him however what such a 
horse would cost, he answered four hundred dollars 
that fine horses were scarce & dear. Remember us 
in affectionate terms to Mrs. Pitzhugh & the rest of 
your family, and believe me to be as I sincerely am 
always

MOUNT VERNON 2Sth Jany. 1799 
Dear Sir, 

Your letters of the nth. of May, i6th. of July, soth. 
of August, and loth, of October are all before me. 
The receipt of the two first I have acknowledged; 
but as my letters wch travel across the Atlantic have 
not been fortunate in getting to their address, these 
may have shared the usual fate. Being of little 
importance, however, no duplicate was sent nor copy 
taken : Nor is it at all material now, whether they 
got to hand or not. 

Your letter of the 2oth. of August found me in Phila- 
delphia, whither I had gone at the request of the Secre- 



258 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

tary of War, to aid in the formation of the New Corps, 
about to be raised ; and in some other Military arrange- 
ments which were necessary, at that time, to be ad- 
justed : and coming in the nick of time, your then wish 
to engage in a Military career was attended to, and you 
were accordingly, appointed to the Command of an 
Infantry Company, in the first Regiment of Virginia, 
to be Commanded by Colo. Thomas Parker of Freder- 
ick, which has been rendered valid by the President 
and Senate since. 

The business which carried me to Philadelphia, 
detained me in that City from the loth, of Novr. until 
the i4th. of Deer., and occasioned an absence from 
home of near Seven weeks, during which time I was 
so much occupied as not to be able to give you advice 
of this occurrence; and soon after my return, your 
letter of the loth, of October came to hand informing 
me of your having been received into the family of Mr. 
King, as his Secretary. 

You have now, I presume the option of remaining 
there, or of accepting the Commission before mentioned. 
In the choice of which you have your own inclination, 
& some other considerations to consult. Both are at- 
tended with uncertainties, but which most so, is not 
easy to decide. The augmented Corps, in which you are 
appointed, are by law, to exist no longer than the dis- 
pute with France shall continue; but how long this 
will be, will require more wisdom than I possess to fore- 
tell; and you know, without information from me, 
what a bugbear a standing army (as a few Regiments 
with us are called, though liable to be disbanded at 
any moment, by withholding the appropriation for yr. 
support) is, in the eyes of all those who are continually 
raising Spectres & Hobgoblins to affrighten themselves, 
and alarm the People : and how certain it is that ours 
(with their consent) will not exist a momt. longer than 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 259 

it can be avoided by their endeavors; whether the 
cause which gave rise to it ceases, or not. Of the pros- 
pect before you in the Diplomatic line, you are as com- 
petent to judge of it as I am ; But, as it is probable 
the Commission will be held for you, until your determi- 
nation is known, no time should be lost in announcing 
it to me, or at the War office. 

Lawrence Lewis is appointed a Capt. in the Corps of 
light Dragoons; but before he enters the Camp of 
Mars, he is to engage in that of Venus with Nellie Custis 
on 22nd. of next month; they having, while I was in 
Philadelphia, without my having the smallest sus- 
picion that such an affair was in agitation, formed their 
Contract for this purpose Washington Craik is ap- 
pointed a Lieutenant in the said Corps, & Washington 
Custis is made Cornet in Lewis's Troop; for it was 
found impracticable to keep him longer at College with 
any prospect, of advantage; so great was his aversion 
to study; tho* adicted to no extra vagent or vicious 
habits, but from mere indolence, & a deriliction to 
exercise the powers of his mind, and those talents with 
which nature had blessed him: The Army generally 
will be very respectably officered : 

The General Assembly of this State is in Command, 
by the account of its proceedings scanning into every 
kind of opposition to the measures of the General 
government, and on the extra vagent Resolutions which 
folly can devise; in what they will issue, it is difficult 
to say, 

I am sorry to inform you that your brother John 
Dandridge is no more. He paid the debt of Nature a 
few days since ; after having (as we have been informed) 
been in bad health for some time. 

Your Aunt, who is as well as usual, and Nelly Custis 
(Washington, however, is from home) unite with me 
in every good wish for you; and with thanks for your

My dear Sir, 

By the ship Nancy from London, just arrived at Al- 
exandria I have received four copies of the Prints of 
the deaths of Montgomery & Warren (the number of 
sets I presume I subscribed for) sent me by your 
brother. 

It is my wishes to make him a remittance agreeable 
to the terms of the subscription but having taken no 
copy of it not being able to recollect what is to p>ay, 
must be my apology for troubling you with this letter 
presuming that the original Paper or a copy thereof 
might have been left with you, and moreover, that you 
may be empowered to receive from the subscribers in 
the United States the amount of their subscriptions, in 
which case, upon receiving the advice, I shall, instead 
of making the remittance of mine to London, transmit 
it to you. 

Whether anything was to have been paid in advance, 
& whether in that case I paid mine is more than I can 
decide without a resort for the letter to my Papers from 
Philadelphia which are yet to be unpacked, and ar- 
ranged. 

By a paper accompanying the Prints of Montgom- 
ery & Warren the other part of the original design is 
suspended, on account of the peculiarity of the times. 

As I shall not write Brothr. Trumball until I hear 
from you, the sooner you can make it conveniettf to give

it will be. 

I enquire frequently after you, & with pleasure hear 
always that you enjoy good health. Mrs. Washing-

MOUNT VERNON, 3d. Mar., 1799. 
Sir, 

Mr. Anderson has shown me your letter of the 23d. 
ultimo, to him, with an estimate of the expence of build- 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 263 

ing horse mills, differently constructed. For the 
trouble you have taken in this business, I feel myself 
very much obliged. 

A Mill grinding from 15 to 20 bushl. a day, with two 
horses, would nearly, if not entirely answer all my pur- 
poses ; with the occasional aid of the water mill which 
in the driest seasons, grinds a little. 

For this reason I prefer greatly your last plan 
namely fixing a mill to one of the threshing machines 
now erected ; if you are perfectly satisfied in your own 
mind that it will grind according to your estimate 
even the smallest quantity that is 15 bushl. a day 
and I prefer moreover annexing it to the machine at 
Union, as most central to the Farms, & more conven- 
ient on other accounts. 

Having thus determined, I am now to request, that 
you will purchase the best pair of Cologn stones (men- 
tioned in your letter) and, if anything else can be much 
better prepared at Richmond than here, to provide & 
send the whole round by the first conveyance : and be 
ready to come up yourself to put the whole together, 
so soon as you shall be advised of their arrival. 

Being acquainted with the abilities of my tradesmen 
in their different lines, you know, of course, what they 
are capable of executing; and as materials of all sorts 
(with a little previous notice) can be provided, and in 
the forwardness you may direct, on the spot, I am per- 
suaded you will run me to no other expence to obtain 
them from Richmond than shall in your judgment, be 
essential. You will please to advise me of the time I 
may expect you, & them, 

With esteem I am Sir 

Your Very Hble. Servt.,

MOUNT VERNON, lyth, Mar., 1799. 
Dear Sir, 

In April, after yon quit the Walks of Public Kfe 
(1797.) I agreed with one George Ball for the Land I 
held in Gloucester County; on account of which, he 
made me a small payment of ^200, or thereabouts ; 
was to have paid about three hundred more the April 
following; and the bale, in two annual instalments 
thereafter. Since which I have never seen Mr. Ball, 
nor have heard from him on this subject. And what is 
still more extraordinary, I do not know whether he 
removed to the Land, or where he now lives ; conse- 
quently, do not know with certainty at what place to 
direct to him. 

This, my good Sir, must be my apology for giving you 
the trouble of the enclosed; in order, if he lives in 
Gloucester (on the land) that it may be forwarded to 
him; if not, to be returned to Dr. Sir

Colo. Thos Lee (of Londoun) is possessed, I am in-

mile of Colchester, which he is disposed to sell. 

Let me request the favour of you to describe it to me 
as accurately as you can from your own knowledge, 
or from the information of others on whose judgment 
you can rely. 

In doing this, say what the kind & quality of the doil

the growth is; what proportion is in wood; how

MOUNT VERNON i8th Mar. 1799 
Sir, 



Your letter of the isth. Ulto. came duly to hand, and 
I feel obliged by the pains you were at to obtain gold 
thread for the uniform suit you were requested to make 
and forward to me. I am perfectly satisfied that 
nothing was left unattempted on your part to comply 
with my order. 

This article (gold thread) being expected in the 
Spring Importations, you will provide what is good, 
and have the suit compleated (by skilful workmen) 
agreeably to former directions, and sent in the manner 
required in my last letter. 
I am Sir 
Your Very Hble. Servt.

Dear Sir, 

The enclosed came under cover to me a few days ago, 
and not knowing into whose hands better to place it 
than yours, I forward it to you accordingly. 

The doing so, furnishes an opportunity of condoling 
with you and the other friends of Mr. John Dandridge, 
on his death ; an event I sincerely regretted. 

From the superscription, I know the enclosed letter 
is from your brother Bartholomew; who, no doubt, has 
therein informed of his present situation; should I be 
mistaken however, in this conjecture, he is now Secre- 
tary to our Minister (Mr. King) in London ; a Post as 
honourable, as it may ultimately prove advantageous 
to him in his passage through life. The family at this 
place are all well, and offer you there best wishes

Gentlemen, 

Prom my correspondent in Boston, I have (within 
these two days) received the bill of cost of Glass shipped 
from thence for my use viz $250.13 and am 
advised that the amount is to be paid to your house, 

Be so good therefore to advise me whether you have 
any acct. in Alexandria to whom I shall pay the 
money? or whether you would prefer having it re- 
mitted in a letter, in Bank Notes? as there is no person 
in Baltimore City whom I give the trouble of doing 
business for Gentlemen

OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 267 

MOUNT VERNON, 2d. July, 1799. 
Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 25th. has been received; but you 
have mistaken the case entirely with respect to the 
Asses who were sent to my Jacks; charging you 
nothing for the services of the latter, and not designed 
to lay you under obligation, but a feeble effort to repay 
the kindnesses you have heaped upon me. 

Colo. Gilpin has forwarded the wrong box of glass to 
Baltimore, and soon will, I hope, receive the proper one 
in return. 

Enclosed is a check on the Bank of Alexandria for 
one thousand dollars agreeably to the demand of Mr. 
Blagden. for the purpose of defraying the expenses in- 
curred on my buildings in the Fedl. City. 

With very great esteen & regard. I am Dear, 
Your Obedt. & Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 

P. S. In the letter accompanying the glass from 
Boston the makers say " the Glass must be set con- 
vex out. "

MOUNT VERNON, 2ist. July 1799 
Gentlemen, 

Enclosed are the other half parts of the two hundred 
and fifty dollars remitted in my letter of the loth, 
instant, together with half a dollar to make the sum 
charged for the glass from the manufactory at Boston.- 

If your letter of the isth. acknowledging the receipt 
of that from me dated the ist. instant which had been 
written instead on the loth, which contained the parts 
of Bill, had taken the least notice of the contents of the 
letter, all doubt of their having reached you would 
have ceased, the mistake of dates notwithstanding.

money and the purpose for which it has been remitted 
by Gentlemen

MOUNT VERNON yth Augt. 1799 
Sir, 

Your letter of the $th instant was presented to me 
yesterday on my way home, and not read until I 
reached here. 

As I have no concern in publishing my letters uncon- 
nected with military affairs, so it it neither my wish or 
intention to interfere with them, if they do not relate 
to myself personally. I have neither Doctor Thornton's 
letter nor my answer to it before me. I mean to ex- 
press no sentiments on either ; or on the subject to 
which they aluded, further than that, a question was 
asked me to which I gave an answer from the best rec- 
ollection I had of the case. 

Because you have requested, and inasmuch as I had 
no opportunity of dealing therewith while I was in the 
City, I now enclose your letter to me of the above date 
to the Commissioners. The list transmitted us you 
will receive under this cover. 

I am Sir Your most obedt. servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
MR. GEO. WALKER. 

MOUNT VERNON, i4th. Aug., 1799. 
Sir, 

It is reported & generally believed that the Houses I 
am building in the Federal City are engaged to you. 

To your having the houses I have no objection, nor 
should I have any to the prevalance of the report, if a 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 269 

specific agreement had ever taken place. But as this 
is not the case, and until it happens may, & doubtless 
will be injurious to me ; Inasmuch as they may prevent 
applications from others, it has become necessary that 
this matter should be clearly understood. 

It is not my intention, nor is it my wish, on the one 
hand, to ask an unreasonable rent : on the other hand, 
I am not disposed to be a loser by these buildings. I 
have made the best enquiries my opportunities have 
afforded, into the expectations of others with respect to 
Rents, & find none who are inclined to let their pro- 
perty in the Federal City or anywhere else indeed, for 
less than seven & an half pr. cent on the whole expend- 
iture; to which they add the taxes thereof to that of 
Insurance against Fire. Some, I am told, will not ac- 
cept o this as an equivalent Rent, because it will give 
them little (if any more they say) than common interest 
for their money; when it is well known that the wear & 
tare if houses require much more. 

Upon the terms, however, herementioned (having no 
pecuniary inducement to build) you may become the 
occupant of my lots and the improvement thereon in 
the Federal City; keeping them in repair as is cus- 
tomary; and rests with you to say yea, or nay, to make 
it a bargain or otherwise. The whole amount of the 
cost can, & shall be shown to the minutest fraction, to 
whomsoever is disposed to acceded to these terms; 
because the prices of the lots are known, & everything 
being new, the business ready, & can easily be shown to 
any one. 

You may reasonably, & justly suppose that the lots 
were obtained upon the best terms, because building 
houses where the condition thereof; and because the 
materials were procured without credit, for I pay or 
demd. for them & the Worksmen's wages. AH parts of 
the work will I persuade myself, from the character of 



2 7 o LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

the undertaker, be well executed, and in a neat & 
handsome but not a costly style. 

With this explanation & information you will be en- 
abled to give a definitive answer; which I shall 
shortly expect, that I may know whether to consider 
you as a Tenant or not. One of the Houses, by con- 
tract is to be finished in November next. The other in 
March, following.

Your favor of the loth inst. enclosing a letter from 
Mr. Veatch of the 7th. instant, came duly to hand. 
The receipt of which ought to have been sooner acknow- 
ledged as he appears to be waiting directions. 

I am very well satisfied with the Rents of my part of 
Woodstock as they now stand ; but if you, on consult- 
ing Mr. Veatch should be of opinion that they could be 
placed on a better footing now, or at any time hence, it 
would be equally agreeable to me that you should make 
the attention and shall be confirmed by.

I am persuaded that in the benefit which the nature 
of his case would advise he has, or will receive from

your treatment of the affliction tinder which he has 
been and if it is incurable he must be satisfied that I 
have neglected nothing to restore his spirit to him. 

It was an imposition to ask you for money, for I gave 
him more than sufficient to bear his expences down & 
up? and impudent to say I had directed it. A liberty 
I never should have thought of.

Gentlemen, 

Monday's mail brought me the enclosed letter of the 
22nd. Instant from Colo. Pickering. 

As it is more in your line than in mine, to give it the 
consideration which so interesting a subject merits; 
and as the field (hitherto so little cultivated) refers to 
the adoption of any plan which wisdom, sound policy 
& foresight may dictate, I take the liberty of transmit- 
ting it for your persual, being persuaded that the 
thought of any intelligent and well disposed person on 
a point of such importance to the wellbeing of a City 
which is designated to be the seat of Empire, cannot be 
illy received by you.

My Miller's time as I informed you would be the case,

For your politeness in sending the latter, I pray you 
to receive my best thanks. -Much indeed is it to be 
wished that the sentiments contained in the Pamphlet, 
and the doctrine it endeavors to inculcate, were more 
prevalent. Happy would it be for this country at least, 
if they were so. But while the passions of mankind are 
under so little restraint as they are among us. and 
while there are so many motives & views, to bring

also that there will befalls upon me that may not con-

to renew it : and will thank you for taking the neces-

MOUNT VBRNON, ist. Septr., 1799. 
Dear Sir, 

Your letter with its enclosure, was not received until 
after candlelight last night; owing, I presume, to my 
not having sent to the Post Office on Friday: rarely 
sending oftener than every other day, for my letters 
& Papers. 

I have put my name to the enclosed note, although 
it ought to have been at the Bank yesterday; to be 
returned, or destroyed, as circumstances require. 

This business of borrowing and discount (as you will 
perceive) I am quite a novice in. What I meant by 
renewing my note, was no more than, instead of taking 
it up, by applying so much of my deposit in Bank to 
this purpose in payment thereof to let it remain so as 
that, this sum might be at my command, whether I 
adopted proper means to effect this end, you are the 
best judge. 

It is quite immaterial to me, whether the discount 
was made last week this week or the nest provided 
all things are right with respect to the old note ; which 
being for Sixty days I know ought to be paid at the end 
thereof, or renewed. With this explanation of my in- 
tentions you will please to have, or cause to be done, 
what is proper on my part that I may not be brought 
into any unpleasant predicament at the Bank.

MOUNT VERNON 22d. Sept. 1799 
Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the i6th. instt. has been received, 
informing me of the death of my brother. 

The death of near relatives always produce awful, 
and affecting emotions, under whatsoever circum- 
stances it may happen. That of my brother's has 
been so long expected, and his later days so uncom- 
fortable to himself, must have prepared all around 
him for the stroke, though painful in the effect. 

I was the first and now the last of my father's 
Children by the second marriage who remain. When 
I will be called upon to follow is known only to the 
giver of life. When the summons comes I shall en- 
deavor to obey with a good grace. Mrs. Washington 
has been and still is very much indisposed but joins 
with me in best wishes for you & Mrs. Ball and family.

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the i6th. Instant came to my hands 
by the last post. I learn with regret the cause of 
General [Charles Cotesworth] Pinckney's visit to 
Rhode Island. Prom the accounts of his Lady's 
health by Brigr. Genl. Washington, it is to be feared 
her case is dangerous. 

I am sorry to hear that the Recruiting Service, in 
the district to which you were assigned, progresses so 
slowly. It was conjectured beforehand that you 
would have many difficulties to encounter there, The 
result therefore, is not a matter of surprise. 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 277 

Until you are requested to join the General Officer 
to whose person you are attached, or directed by 
him to remain Stationary for the purpose of receiving, 
& executing his orders, I conceive it will be best on

disposed but joins in greeting you with

CAPT. PRESLY THORNTON. 

MOUNT VERNON, 25th Sept., 1799. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 2nd. instt. came duly to hand ; 
but previous thereto, I had written to Mr. Francis of 
Philadelphia, (who report had engaged the houses to, 
I was building in the Federal City) to have in explicit 
terms whether he meant to take them, or not, on the 
conditions I offered them, namely Seven and an half 
per sent on the whole cost ; to which, taxes, if any 
and Insurance against fire, were to be added. On 
lower terms, no person in the Fedl. City, or elsewhere 
that I could hear of would let ; a but few who would 
sell on these, as it was but little more than legal and 
common interest of money when it is well known that 
the wear & of houses required much more. 

I have waited until now, to name Mr. Francis's an- 
swer, without hearing from him; which has been the 
cause of my not replying to your letter sooner. If 
his answer is detained much longer, I shall feel myself 
under no obligation to prefer him, because he was the 
first applicant, for them. 

Although my house, or houses (for they may be one or 
two as occasion requires) are I believe, upon a large 
scale than any in the vicinity of the Capital, yet they, 



278 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

fall far short of your wishes. The largest room, and 
that occasionally made so, is not more than a foot in 
length. The houses are three flush stories of Brick, 
besides Garret rooms : and in the judgment of those 
better acquainted in these matters than I am, capable 
of accommodating between twenty & thirty boarders. 
The buildings are not costly, but elegantly plain. and 
the whole cost at a pretty neat guess may be be- 
tween fifteen and sixteen thousand dollars. I am Sir 
Your very Hble. Servant 

G. WASHINGTON. 

To MR. JOHN AVERT* 

MOUNT VBRNON 3oth. Septr. 1799 
Sir, 

I ought to begin this letter with an apology for 
having neglected to do, what should have been 
done long ago, that is to remit the balance due on 
my subscription for Mr. TrumbuH's Prints. 

The truth is that by waiting awhile for the un- 
packing of my papers to see if any thing would be 
found elucidative of my payment on this occasion, 
the thing had escaped me altogether, and occured 
again by accident. 

I now find that on the 5th of April 1790, I paid to 
John Trumbull, Esqr. twelve guineas, which is entered 
in my Books as being one half of the subscription for 
four copies of two prints to be published by him* 
This, I presume, was paid at the time of my subscribing ; 
and as you observe in your letter of the 2 6th. of Marchi 
that the other half of the subscription money was to 
be paid on delivery of the prints, I enclose you a check 
on the Bank of Pennsylvania for twelve guineas more 
say fifty six dollars for which sum, when you shall

have received it, I pray you to advise me, specifying 
in the receipt, the purpose for which it was paid.

last half year. Not knowing precisely, what percent- 
age it drew, I am uncertain whether it will exceed, or 
fall short of your demand on me, for the zd. Instalment 
on lot, No, 1 6, in the City. If the latter, please to in- 
f ormcime of the deficiency and the amount shall be trans- 
mitted in Bank notes. With great esteem & regard,

plished I will forward a check on that Bank for the 
$1000 required by Mr. Blagden, & hope it will be in time 
to answer his purposes. 

I have no objection for Mr. Blagden's frequent calls 
for money but I fear the work which is not enumerated 
in the Contract with him, is pretty smartly whipped up 
in the price of it. I had no expectation (for instance)

Sir, 

Your favour of the i5th. instant, in answer to my 
letters of the 9th & 8th & addressed to the Surveyor 
General of the Land Office (wch. proves the necessity 
there was for my plea of ignorance) came duly to hand, 
with the Land Office Treasury warrants for your oblig- 
ing attention to which, I pray you to accept my thanks. 

Perceiving by your letter that Willm. Shepherd has 
made a Survey, & returned it to your Office, similar in 
some respects to my proposed Entry; and believing 
that; it must have been done unknowingly to those who 
have lands adjoining, and comprehends land always 
reputed to be mine; and so understood by all the 
neighbourhood thereabts. I request the favour of you to 
furnish me with a copy of the Survey & Plat, that I 
may be enabled thereby to investigate the matter more 
fully. Until which, I must beg that this letter may be 
considered as a covent against a Grant thereof to Wm. 
Shepherd. 

If the rules & Proceedings in your Office require a 
more formal protest against such issue, I must rely on 
your goodness to advice me, for having had very little 
to do with the local Laws of the State since the Revo- 
lution, & not having those passed since that period by 
me, I may be mistaken in this, as in my former appli- 
cation. 

Enclosed is a five dollar Bill ; if it be insufficient to 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 281 

cover the expense of the Land Warrant, Copy of 
Shepherd's Survey, and the Protest against a Grant 
issuing thereon you will please to advice. 

As another proof of my unacquaintedness in this 
business my expectation was, that the Entry I pro- 
posed to make would have covered all the land within 
the described location, but the warrant fix it, I per- 
ceive, to 100 acres only. It may be more or it may be 
kess ; and cannot be ascertained until, the Survey is 
made. I should not like to be fixed to the above 
quantity, if the vacant land exceeds it. 

I am Sir 
Your Most Obedient and Very Hble. Servant

MOUNT VERNON, 2oth. Nov., 1799. 
Dear Sir, 

When I wrote to you the other day, I expected to 
have settled matters with the Bk. of Alexandria so as 
to have been enabled to have sent you, for Mr. Blagden's 
use, a check thereon for $1000. But not being well 
enough acquainted with the rules of the Bank, I suf- 
fered what are called discount days, to pass over be- 
fore I applied ; for which reason the business there must 
remain over until after Tuesday of next week. 

But, if to do this will be attended with any incon- 
venience to Mr, Blagden, and he will be at the trouble of 
riding, or sending any person down here, competent to 
receive the money Mr. Lewis, who has it by him, will 
lend me that sum, and it shall be paid of this I would 
thank you for informing Mr, Blagden. 
With esteem &ca., 

I remain Yr. Obedt. Servt.

282 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

MOUNT VERNON 2 3rd. Novr. 1799- 

Gentlemen, 

Your letter of the ipth. was reed, yesterday, If 
my attendance at Mr. Heiskell's in Alexandria on the 
2 6th. could render you any real service, I would do 
it with pleasure. 

But all that I could relate would be hearsay whilst 
means exist, to obtain (I presume) positive proofs of 
the facts you wish to establish. 

With respect to the division of the tract of (what you 
call) 51,302 acres, I am as ignorant as any man whom 
you might pick up, by chance in the Streets of Alex- 
andria. 

I believe Mr. Jno. West, deceased, was one of the 
Patentee' in the large Survey of the Mo. of the Great 
Kanhawa; but to this fact I would give no positive 
evidence: for after being at the whole trouble, and 
the greater part of the expence to obtain a recognition 
of the original grant of 200,000 Acres; and being 
compelled, very improperly I did think, and always 
have thought, to take it in twenty Surveys, the 
Government and Council found themselves, by this 
act (which was protested against) tinder the necessity 
of jumbling a number of names into the same Patent, 
in order to give each claimant according to his grade, 
& the ratio they had alloted him the pth (?) allowed, 
whereas if the privilege of locating that quality, 
within the District which they had assigned for this- 
purpose had been given to each Claimant, it would 
have prevented all the difficulties, and perplexities 
which have ensued, to the inconvenience of all, and 
entire loss of the land to some. 

But thus the matter was ordered, by that body, 
after which, and the issuing of the Patents consequent 
thereof, my Agency ceased; and I concerned myself 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 283 

with no other part of the land than was assigned me, 
& such as I purchased thereafter of others. 

With respect to the decision of the tract you allude 
to, so far am I from knowing that it was made 
according to law, that I do not know it was ever made ; 
and as to the issue of Mr. Jno. West, I am entirely 
unacquainted, otherwise than by report ; never having 
been in his house, that I recollect, more than once 
and that over 30 years ago and 25 of which but little 
in this state. I am Gentn.

Sir, 

In answer to your letter of the syth ulto, If you 
have no vessel passing below this (from whence the 
Sugar could be landed with very little trouble or delay) 
I request that it may be deposited at Colo. Gilpin's, in 
Alexandria. 

Let the cask in which it is packed, be well secured, 
the sugars hitherto had from you, has, sometimes, 
fallen short in weight. I am Sir

TRACED FACSIMILE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S 
CHARACTERISTIC WRITING. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON 285 

MOUNT VERNON, 2cL Deer., 1799. 

Sir, 

I have been duly favoured with your letter of the 2 5th 
ulto. enclosing a copy of the Survey made for William 
Shepherd, for four & three quarter acres, and the 
form of a Carrate against the issuing a Patent therefor. 

I cannot from the Survey, discover with presision 
where this land lyes, and therefore shall give no further 
opposition to the Grant of it. If it be, where I suspect 
it is within the bounds of a Patent under which I hold, 
of more than sixty years' standing of course, cannot 
effect it. 

I am sorry that I have given you so much trouble in 
this business, at the same time that I feel obliged by the 
prompt and ready advice you have been so kind as to 
give me for the prosecution of it. From what I had 
heard of Shepherd's Survey, I conceived differently of 
its object. 

I am Sir 

Your Obedt. Hble. Servt. 

G. WASHINGTON. 
To WILLM. PRICE, Esq. 

MOUNT VERNON, ad. Deer. 1799 
Dear Sir, 

Since you mentioned the Plaster of Paris which was 
for sale in Richmond, (but after you left this) it oc- 
curred to me that as it was not a saleable article with 
you it might be my cheapest mode to purchase there to 
supply my wants of this article next year on my 
Farms around me. 

Permit me, for this reason, to ask the favour of you to 
learn from the Gentleman who has it for sale, what 
quantity he has? the lowest price he would take for it 
by the ton (the whole being purchased) there? and 
what delivered at my landing? As a Merchant, ac- 



2 S6 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

quainted with Navigation, he will be at no loss to know 
at what freight it could be delivered here. 

A Gentleman now in Alexandria is endeavouring to 
obtain Subscribers for a vessel load from Nova Scotia ; 
the terms I have not learned ; but if that in Richmond 
be good, and had as low, I should prefer because it is al- 
ready in the Country, and the risques of the Sea 
avoided. 

All, however, depends upon its being of the true sort 
for without this, it would be as useless for the purpose 
intended, as pebble stones. There are two colours of it 
one has a greyish the other a blewish cast; the 
latter I think is prefered; but both are good when 
perfectly free from grit, or sand ; having any of the 
latter is a proof of its baseness. The best criterion for 
ascertaining its property, is, by putting the fine powder 
of the plaster, into a skillet or Pot without moisture, 
the good will swell, or rise up ; the bad will remain dead, 
& motionless. 

I would thank you for sending me (if to be had) two 
glaized leather hats such as your Postilions wore, and 
of that size, Accompany them with the cost, and the 
money shall be remitted in a bank note. I am in no 
immediate want of them ; an occasional, or water trans- 
portation (directed to the home of Colo. Gilpinin Alexa.) 
will do. 

I hope you got down safe. Our Comps, to Mrs. 
Carrington. I am always Dear Sir 

Your Affecte. and Obedt.

MOUNT VERNON, 2$th June, 1798. 
Dear Sir, 

You will perceive by the enclosed in what manner I 
am disappointed in receiving the Rent for my house in 



OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 287 

Alexandria. These things put you, the payer & my- 
self in an awkward situation, for it must seem strange 
to demand what has been paid. I must therefore re- 
quest, in explicit terms, that you will receive no more 
monies due to me, and I should be glad to have a state- 
ment of the % as it stands between us, since the last 
was rendered, it appearing by information, from my 
Collector in Montgomery County, Maryland, that some 
parts of my Rents there, had been paid to you since the 
period above mentioned. 

I have not the smallest doubt of my being credited 
for every farthing you receive on my % but that 
does not remedy the evil. With sincere esteem and 
regard I am Yr Affe

MOUNT VERNON, 26th June, 1798. 
Dear Sir, 

Mr. Anderson requesting that the boy who was going 
to the Post Office yesterday, might call & deliver a 
letter to you, from him, concerning flour. Availing 
myself of that conveyance, I sat down, and was in the 
act of writing the hasty lines you received from me by 
him, when I was summoned to dinner. In my hurry 
to close and Seal it, I omitted the enclosure then re- 
fered to, and which is now forwarded. 

I can only repeat, what I mentioned yesterday, that 
I never had the most distant suspicion that every far- 
thing that you had received, or might receive on my %, 
would be justly credited, but this will not supply my 
wants, and it would be uncandid and inconsistent with 
the frankness of friendship, not to declare that I have 
not approved nor cannot approve, of having my money 
received and applied to uses not my own, without my 



288 LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS 

consent, and even without advice of it ; which, among 
other improprieties of the measure, involves the awk- 
ward, and unpleasant consequences mentioned in my 
letter of yesterday. 

You must be too well acquainted with the product of 
my Farms, & the expence I live at, to need information 
that my income, arising from them, would not meet my 
expenditures, and that, had it not been for monies 
arising from the Sale of Lands, my business must have 
stopped, or my embarrassments at this moment would 
have been great and in this last resourse, I have met 
with disappointments, for of three nay four Instal- 
ments for different tracts of land, now & sometime 
since due, I see no likelihood of receiving a shilling. 

I do not bring these facts to your view with inten- 
tion of reminding you of your Debt to me. On the 
contrary, take your own time, & convenience, to pay 
it, but let the whole % be settled, that I may see, and 
know the precise statement of the Balance between us. 
With the greatest esteem & friendship, I remain 

Your Affectionate

MOUNT VERNON, 4th July 1798 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter and % of the 2d Inst, 
and presume it is all right. I wish however you had 
charged the Scow, & given credit, for the articles had 
from Mr. Anderson, as it was my wish to have seen a 
complete state of it. 

The thousand dollars lent, was not on usury; and 
therefore I desire it may be struck out of your % as I 
shall do it out of mine, when it comes to be entered in 
my Ledger. I mean the Interest, which you have 



OP GEORGE WASHINGTON 289 

given me credit for $60 And it is not my desire, as I 
mentioned in my former letter, that you should put 
yourself to any inconvenience in paying the principal. 

I have been so much engaged for the few days, past, 
that I have been unable to look into any accounts 
whatever, of course, I cannot now say what has been 
charged to me, as paid to you. I recollected however, 
that this was plead, when my Collector in Maryland 
was called upon for my Rents. 

My Papers are yet in such a jumble, that I know not 
where, readily to look for your former % ; but it dwells 
upon my Memory that in that, I was charged with ^50 
paid the Trustees of the Academy in Alexandria if I 
am right in this, the Treasurer thereof has received a 
year's annuity more than the School is entitled to. 
Reference to your Books, if you have them by you, or 
to the % rendered to me when I come across it, will 
decide the matter at once. 

With very great esteem and respect 
I am Dear Sir 

Your affectionate 

G. WASHINGTON
