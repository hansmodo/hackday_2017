MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS 



RELATING TO 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 



INTRODUCTION 
TO THE SECOND PART. 



This division of the work is intended to embrace the 
period of the American Revolution, and to include such 
of the letters and other writings of Washington, as have 
been selected for publication, from the time he was ap- 
pointed Commander-in-chief of the army, till he resigned 
his commission at the end of the war. Whether re- 
garded as to the variety, extent, and dignity of the topics 
on which they treat, as authentic materials for history, 
or as illustrating the character and acts of the great 
American patriot, these papers possess an extraordinary 
value and interest. They not only present an entire 
view of the operations in which Washington was en- 
gaged, as the military chieftain of the war of indepen- 
dence, through every stage of the contest, but they 
incidentally exhibit the internal condition and resources 
of the countr}^ the spirit of the people, the policy, aims, 
and doings of the Continental Congress, and the origin 
and progress of the new forms of civil government, 
which were set up by the States and by smaller com- 
munities, as circumstances required, and to which the 
people, and even Washington at the head of his armies, 
rendered implicit obedience.

VIll INTRODUCTION. [Part II- 

Two complete copies of Washington's revolutionary 
correspondence have been preserved at Mount Vernon. 
The first consists of the original files, vi^hich he always 
kept with him for reference and use in camp and in his 
campaigns ; the second is a literal transcript from these 
originals, recorded in forty-four large volumes, in which 
all the letters are classified and arranged according to 
their subjects and dates. This transcript was executed 
under his own direction near the close of the war, by 
secretaries employed for the purpose, who wrote a fair 
and handsome hand, and on whose fidelity he could 
rely. Even the dimensions of the volumes, the quality 
of the paper, and the style of binding, were prescribed 
by himself. Each parcel in the files is designated by a 
letter of the alphabet, and each paper in the parcel is 
numbered. By the aid of corresponding marks in the 
margin of the letter-books, a sure and speedy reference 
may be had to any original paper in the whole series. 
A brief sketch of the plan, as drawn out by Washington, 
and a few explanatory remarks, will show at the same 
time the principles of the arrangement, and the varied 
subjects of his correspondence. 

1. Under the first great division were classed letters 
to the Congress of the United States ; to Committees 
of Congress ; to the Board of War and Ordnance ; to 
American Ministers Plenipotentiary at Foreign Courts ; 
to individual Members of Congress in their Public Char- 
acters. 

As he received his appointment, commission, instruc- 
tions, and all his powers from Congress, it was neces- 
sary, that his intercourse with that body should be full, 
constant, and of the most confidential kind. In the first 
place, the army was new, undisciplined, unprovided ; very 
few of the members of Congress Avere military men, or 
possessed any knowledge of military affairs either prac- 



Part II.] INTRODUCTION. ix 

practical or theoretical ; the burden of organizing and 
disciplining the army was at once thrown upon the 
Commander-in-chief. But all the arrangements of this 
sort, the rules and regulations, and every contemplated 
change, were to be approved by Congress before they 
could take effect; and Congress reserved wholly to them- 
selves the appointment of the general officers. Thus it 
was not only the duty of Washington to obey instruc- 
tions and execute orders, but he was obliged to suggest 
what these orders should be, and wait till his sugges- 
tions were passed into resolves by the Congress. This 
was frequently a source of delay and embarrassment ; it 
was a heavy and perpetual tax upon the forethought and 
reflection of the Commander-in-chief, and made him 
virtually the head and soul of the whole military system, 
although a jealousy of their civil rights, and a fear of the 
tendency of warlike ambition, induced the members of 
Congress to keep a salutary check in their own hands. 
The condition of the army and an account of all the 
principal occurrences were communicated at stated 
times to Congress, doubtful cases were referred to their 
decision, and returns forwarded respecting the depart- 
ments of the commissaries, quartermasters, and other 
officers engaged in providing for the wants of the army, 
and regulating its internal economy. The intimate and 
peculiar relations, thus subsisting between Congress and 
the army, gave rise to a correspondence, which, although 
it necessarily ran into details, was nevertheless of great 
importance. For similar purposes he kept up an inter- 
course by letter with Committees of Congress, the 
Board of War, and individual members. By these 
means his views were always presented to that assem- 
bly, and guided them in their deliberations and resolves. 
2. Letters to Provincial Congresses, Conventions, 
and Committees of Safety ; to Governors, Presidents, 

VOL. III. h 



i INTRODUCTION. [Paiit II. 

and other Executives of States; to Civil Magistrates and 
Citizens of every Denomination. 

Although the army was under the general control 
and pay of the Continental Congress, and the number 
of men to be furnished by each State was prescribed 
from time to time by that body, yet the mode of raising 
the men, and in part the supplying of them with arms 
and clothing, were left to the States themselves. It 
was the business of the Commander-in-chief to see, that 
the men were actually brought into the field at the 
proper times and places, as well as to call out the militia 
upon emergencies and to dismiss them when their 
services were no longer required. This duty opened 
a wide field of correspondence with the States, and 
some of Washington's best letters are circulars to the 
governors, making appeals to the patriotism of the peo- 
ple, and urging powerful motives for exertion and sacri- 
fice in the common cause. Wherever the army was 
stadoned, he was always cautious to keep the military 
and civil powers distinct, and to refer to the respective 
States all matters of a local nature, which did not clearly 
come within the jurisdiction of the army. The delicate 
and troublesome concerns of the Tories were of this 
description. The safety of the country required him to 
use the force he commanded to apprehend suspected 
persons ; but he invariably turned them over to the civil 
authorities of the State in which they resided, to be 
dealt with as the proper tribunals should decide. Oc- 
casions frequently occurred, likewise, for corresponding 
with the committees of towns and smaller districts or 
communities. 

3. Letters to Officers of the Line of every Rank ; to 
Officers of the Staff; and to all other Military Characters. 

The correspondence under this head is much more 
voluminous, than that under either of the others. It 



Part II.] INTRODUCTION. 'xi 

extends to the whole army of the United States, how- 
ever divided or wherever stationed ; to the commanding- 
officers in the great departments, to major-generals and 
other officers on separate commands at posts or in de- 
tachments, to officers of every rank engaged in any 
special service, such as partisan enterprises, foraging 
expeditions, or schemes for attacking the enemy's out- 
posts, or procuring intelligence. It also includes in- 
structions to officers from the highest to the lowest; 
directions for the arrangements in camp, as well as the 
movements during a campaign; letters to quartermas- 
ters, commissaries, contractors, the clothier-general and 
his deputies, and all others concerned in providing sup- 
plies tor the army ; to surgeons and superintendents of 
the hospitals ; to militia officers while on Continental 
service ; and to other persons acting in a military capa- 
city within the sphere of his command. 

4. Letters to Foreign Ministers ; to Subjects of For- 
eign Nations in the immediate Service of the United 
States ; to Foreign Officers. 

When the French army came to America, it was, by a 
previous stipulation, to be under the command of Wash- 
ington, while acting in concert with the American army. 
This arrangement, as well as the mutual plans for coop- 
eration, necessarily caused much correspondence be- 
tween Washington, Count Rochambeau, Count d'Es- 
taing, and other commanders of the French army and 
navy. In this the ministers from France to Congress 
participated, as the French military affairs in the United 
States were under their general supervision and guid- 
ance. 

5. Letters to Officers of every Rank and Denomina- 
tion in the Service of the Enemy ; to British Subjects 
of every Descripdon with the Enemy ; to Persons ap- 
plying for Permission to go to the Enemy. 



xil INTRODUCTION. [Part II. 

The most important letters under this head are those 
to the British commanders on various topics, but chiefly- 
relating to the exchange of prisoners, in which there 
were many difficulties emanating from the peculiar rela- 
tions of the two contending armies to each other, and 
the manner in which the British government reg::rded 
the nature of the contest at the beginning of the war. 

6. Private Letters. 

In this division is included a long hst of letters ; and 
although they are classed as private, yet they are mostly 
on subjects appertaining to public concerns. They are 
not official ; but many of them were written to persons 
in public stations, and intended to promote a purpose 
by stronger representations and the force of motives 
more dehcate, than it was expedient to exhibit for gen- 
eral inspection. In this view they may be considered 
as expressing the unreserved sentiments of their author, 
and as explaining his designs and conduct on occasions, 
where the caution required in his official despatches 
must leave much for inference or conjecture. A few 
are mere letters of friendship; but even in such cases 
the great work in which he was engaged seems to have 
absorbed his thoughts, and suggested the principal to- 
pics for his pen. 

Such is the mode projected and adopted by General 
Washington himself for classifying his papers, while 
Commander-in-chief of the American army. Such is the 
broad outhne of the topics to which they extend. The 
arrangement is, in the first instance, according to subjects; 
and, in the second, according to the order of time ; that 
is, the mass of letters is formed into six distinct classes, 
and those in each class are brought together consecu- 
tively by their dates. In preparing them for publication, 
it has been thought preferable to throw them all into the 
order of time, thus preserving a strict continuity in the 



Part II.] INTRODUCTION. xiii 

events to which they relate. This method, indeed, is 
the only one by which a just understanding of the pa- 
pers can be obtained, without much trouble in referring 
from one part to another ; since the subjects upon which 
they treat are not of an abstract nature, but commonly 
relate to the affairs in which the writer was immedi- 
ately concerned, and are blended in the general train of 
the correspondence. 

In selecting the letters for this part of the work, I 
have endeavoured to adhere strictly to the same princi- 
ples, which have already been explained in the Intro- 
duction to the First Part. The question has been 
asked, how far Washington may be considered the ac- 
tual author of the immense number of letters, to which, 
in his official and private capacity, he affixed his name. 
This is a question rather of curiosity, than of any essen- 
tial interest or consequence, and one which it would be 
quite impossible at this day to answer, in regard to 
every individual case. The letters have been preserved 
as they were transcribed into letter-books, and in the 
different handwriting of a great many copyists, who 
were employed from time to time for this purpose. 
The first drafts have been for the most part destroyed ; 
for even in the correspondence during the revolution, 
which now exists in the files that were used at the time, 
the letters thus filed are not in every instance the first 
drafts, but copies, so that it is impossible now to tell by 
whom they were originally penned. All the letters 
printed in the First Part of this work, embracing the 
period before the revolution, I believe were written by 
Washington himself, because a large proportion of them 
are still to be found in his own handwriting, either in 
the condition of first drafts, or as transcribed by himself; 
and because, while acting as an oflicer in the French 
war, he seldom if ever had the services of a secretary, 

VOL. III. B 



XIV INTRODUCTION. [Part II. 

and at Mount Vernon he was certainly his own scribe, 
both in his correspondence and in his extensive trans- 
actions of business. 

That he wrote with his own hand all his official letters 
during the revolution, it would be as preposterous to 
suppose, as that Marlborough, or Bonaparte, or Welling- 
ton, or any other great commander, was the penman of 
all the letters to which he subscribed his name. Com- 
positions of this kind are not adduced as evidences of 
the genius, the rhetorical ingenuity, the brilliant fancy, 
the felicitous invention, or the literary accomplishments 
of the persons, whose names they bear. The value to 
be attached to them, and the high consideration, which 
they justly claim, are derived from the circumstance of 
their being records of great events, expressing the opin- 
ions and unfolding the designs of men, in whose conduct 
and motives the destinies of nations are involved. They 
are the highest and purest fountains of history, and by 
whatever hand the written language is constructed, the 
spirit and substance, the principles, facts, arguments, 
and purposes, must necessarily be considered as flow- 
ing from him, by whose name they are sanctioned ; he 
is responsible for the whole ; his character and reputa- 
tion, as well as the vital interests of the cause entrusted 
to him, are at stake. Caution in weighing, and judgment 
in adopting the sentiments of others, are often not less 
indicative of true wisdom and greatness, than the power 
to originate and combine. It will be seen, by hints 
contained in several of Washington's letters, tliat his 
personal labor in writing was at times intense, even 
amidst the harassing cares and oppressive burdens un- 
der which he struggled in discharging his military duties. 
When he resorted to the assistance of his secretary, 
aids, or other persons, it was his custom sometimes to 
prepare brief minutes of the topics, which he wished to 



Part II.] INTRODUCTION. XV 

have introduced into a letter, and leave the arrangement 
and style to the amanuensis. At other times he would 
dictate in detail the substance of a despatch ; and again, 
when the subject was of minor importance, he would 
give general directions only, which the secretary would 
embody in his own language. 

There is no feature more remarkable, however, in the 
whole series of correspondence, than the similarity which 
prevails throughout in the style, the turns of expression, 
the habits of thought, and particularly the methods of 
stating facts and enforcing arguments. This will be ob- 
vious upon a very slight inspection; and no stronger 
proof can be required of the pervading influence of one 
master-mind, whatever instruments it may have em- 
ployed to communicate its sentiments and effect its de- 
signs. It should be stated, moreover, that the originals 
of many of the ablest and best written papers, which 
will appear in the present work, may still he seen in the 
handwriting of the author. It is a mistake, which some 
have been too ready to adopt, that he was not accus- 
tomed to composition. The truth is, he commenced 
the habit very early, and practised it assiduously till the 
end of his life. It is equally true, that his defective edu- 
cation qualified him but indifferently to attain elegance 
or even accuracy of style. . But he knew when his 
thoughts were clearly and forcibly expressed. To con- 
vey his meaning with directness and emphasis was 
his chief study. Though he frequently betrayed a want 
of skill in the construction of his sentences, yet he was 
fastidious in the use of words, as is manifest from the 
numerous verbal erasures and insertions in his original 
manuscripts. Indeed he seldom suffered a paper of any 
sort to go out of his hands, even an ordinary letter of 
friendship or business, without first composing and cor- 
recting it with studious care, and then transcribing a fair 



XVI INTRODUCTION. [Part II. 

copy. Bundles of letters to the managers of his farms, 
written in the midst of his weightiest public duties, af- 
ford a striking testimony to this fact. 

The notes and other illustrations, comprised in this 
Second Part of the work, have been drawn from mate- 
rials of the highest authenticity, collected in a wide 
range of research, and with much expense of time and 
labor. In the first place, the letters received by Wash- 
ington during the war, amounting to several thousands 
in number, the records of councils of war and courts- 
martial, the opinions of the general officers on important 
subjects, the orderly books, resolves of public bodies, 
and reports of committees, all of which are among his 
papers, afford a rich treasure of facts, to which I have 
constantly resorted. The manuscript papers i-elating to 
the revolution, which are deposited in the office of the 
Secretaiy of State at Washington, containing all that 
remains of the proceedings and correspondence of the 
Old Continental Congress, I have also personally ex- 
amined. For the same purpose I have visited the sev- 
eral States, which belonged to the original Confederation 
and took part in the war, and have examined in the 
pubhc offices of each State the manuscript papers ap- 
pertaining to the period under consideration. It has 
moreover been my good fortune, through the politeness 
of individuals, to gain access to many private collections 
of papers, including the entire correspondence of several 
of the major and brigadier generals of the army, the 
members of the Old Congress, and other civil and mili- 
tary officers of distinction. The materials thus collected, 
being original and perfectly authentic, and proceeding 
from the highest sources, possess a value which may 
easily be estimated. 

In England and France my researches were pursued 
with no less perseverance and success. With a liber- 



PartII.] introduction. xvii 

ality on the part of the governments of both these coun- 
tries, which demands the warmest acknowledgments, I 
was permitted to inspect in the public archives all the 
papers, which relate to the American war. The task 
occupied nearly twelve months of close application, but 
the labor was abundantly rewarded by the results. The 
British offices opened to me the complete correspondence 
of the ministers. Lord Dartmouth and Lord George Ger- 
main, with the governors of the colonies at the begin- 
ning of the contest, and with the commanders in 
America during the whole war, namely. Generals Gage, 
Howe, Burgoyne, Clinton, Robertson, Carleton, Corn- 
wallis, and others of subordinate rank. The original 
correspondence of the British Commissioners, while ne- 
gotiating the peace in Paris, was likewise examined ; 
and also the original papers presented from time to time 
by Lord North to Parliament. 

In Paris my researches embraced the voluminous 
correspondence between Count Vergennes and the 
French ministers, Gerard and Luzerne, while they 
were in the United States, amounting in all to nearly 
four hundred despatches, and unfolding the policy and 
views of the French government from the beginning to 
the end of the war ; also Memowes and other papers on 
American affairs, written by members of the cabinet, or 
by able jurisconsults employed for that purpose. In the 
archives of the Department of War, the despatches of 
Count Rochambeau, and other officers commanding the 
French army in America, were submitted to my exam- 
ination, and such copies as I desired were allowed to be 
taken. 

I feel it a duty, as well as a pleasure, to express on 
this occasion the very high obligations, which I have 
been under to several gentlemen in Europe, who ren- 
dered most generous and valuable services in promoting 

VOL. III. c B* 



XVIU INTRODUCTION. [Part II. 

the object of my inquiries, particularly to Sir James 
Mackintosh, the Marquis of Lansdowne, and Lord Hol- 
land, in London ; to General Lafayette and the Marquis 
de Marbois, in Paris ; and to these I may add Mr. Law- 
rence, at that time Charge d^ Affaires from the United 
States to the Court of Great Britain ; and Mr. Brown, 
the American Minister Plenipotentiary in France. 

From the large extent and various nature of the 
papers above indicated, it is obvious that only a par- 
tial use can be made of them in illustrating the writings 
of Washington ; yet, as they all have a bearing on the 
great train of events, in which he acted the most con- 
spicuous part, they contain many particulars explanatory 
of the designs of persons and parties, which could not 
be known at the time he wrote, and others that will 
throw additional light upon the topics which employed 
his pen, and the affairs in which he was engaged. In 
preparing the notes, I have relied almost exclusively on 
manuscript authorities, and avoided as much as possible 
the encumbering of the pages with matter, which is al- 
ready accessible in printed books. By this process I trust 
it will be found, that some valuable accessions have been 
made to history, at the same time that the character 
and deeds of Washington have received new eluci- 
dation. 

The plans of batdes and military movements, which 
are occasionally inserted for a better understanding of 
the text, have been compiled from the best drawings 
that could be procured, as well English and French as 
American. In this design I have been specially aided 
by a series of manuscript drawings in the possession of 
General Lafayette, which were taken by a French en- 
gineer attached to his staff, and which are executed 
with scientific accuracy and beauty. Some of the old 
drawings, published at the time in London from imper- 



Part II.] INTRODUCTION. xix 

feet sketches and surveys, I have been able to correct 
by the documents, to which I have had access, and by 
actual inspection, having personally visited nearly all the 
localities, which were the theatre of the chief operations 
of the American revolutionary war. No pains have 
been spared to give these plans all the accuracy, of 
which they are susceptible on so small a scale, and with 
the present means of information.

ANSWER TO CONGRESS ON HIS APPOINTMENT 
AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. * 

111 Congress, 16 June, 1775. 

Mr. President, 

Though I am truly .sensible of the high honor done 
me, in this appointment, yet I feel great distress, from 
a consciousness that my abilities and military experi- 
ence may not be equal to the extensive and important 
trust. However, as the Congress desire it, I will enter 
upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I pos- 
sess in their service, and for the support of the glorious 
cause. I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks 
for this distinguished testimony of their approbation. 

But, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfa- 
vorable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered 

* On the 15th of June, Colonel Washington was chosen unanimously 
by the Continental Congress to be General and Conunander-in-chief of 
the American Army. The election was by ballot. As soon as the Con- 
gress assembled the next morning, the President informed him officially 
of this appointment. Colonel Washington then arose in his place, and 
returned the above answer. Before the Congress proceeded to ballot for 
a general, it had been resolved, that his pay sliould be five hundred dollars 
a month. See AprE.NDix, No. I.

by every gentleman in the room, that I, this day, de- 
clare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself 
equal to the command I am honored with. 

As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress, 
that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted 
me to accept this arduous employment, at the expense 
of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to 
make any profit horn it. I will keep an exact account of 
my expenses. Those, I doubt not, they will discharge ; 
and that is all I desire. 



TO MRS. MARTHA WASHINGTON.* 

Philadelphia, 18 June, 1775. 

My Dearest, 

I am now set down to write to you on a subject, 
which fills me with inexpressible concern, and this con- 
cern is gready aggravated and increased, when I reflect 
upon the uneasiness I know it will give you. It has 
been determined in Congress, that the whole army rais- 
ed for the defence of the American cause shall be put 
under my care, and that it is necessary for me to pro- 
ceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the com- 
mand of it. 

You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure 
you, in the most solemn manner, that, so far from seek- 
ing this appointment, I have used every endeavour in 
my power to avoid it, not only from my unwillingness 
to part with you and the family, but from a conscious- 
ness of its being a trust too great for my capacity, and 
that I should enjoy more real happiness in one month 



* This is tlie only letter from Washington to his wife, Avliich has

with you at home, than 1 havo the most distant prospect 
ol' liiiciiiig abioaci, il' my stay were to he seven times 
seven years. But us it has been a kind of destiny, that 
lias tin-own me upon this service, I shall hope that my 
undei'taking it is designed to answer some good pur- 
pose. You might, and I suppose did perceive, from the 
tenor of my letters, that 1 was apprehensive I could not 
avoid this appointment, as I did not pretend to intimate 
when I should return. That was the case. It was 
utterly out of my power to refuse this appointment, 
without exposing my character to such censures, as 
would have reflected dishonor upon myself, and given 
pain to my friends. This, I am sure, could not, and 
ought not, to be pleasing to you, and must have lessened 
me considerably in my own esteem. I shall rel}-, there- 
fore, confidently on that Providence, which has hereto- 
fore preserved and been bountiful to me, not doubting 
but that I shall return safe to you in the fall. I shall 
feel no pain from the toil or the danger of the cam- 
paign ; my unhappiness will flow from the uneasiness I 
know you wiO feel from being left alone. I therefore 
beg, that you will summon your whole fortitude, and 
pass your time as agreeably as possible. Nothing will 
give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this, and 
to hear it from your own pen. My earnest and ai-dent 
desire is, that you would pursue any plan that is most 
likely to produce content, and a tolerable degree of 
tranquillity ; as it must add greatly to my uneasy feel- 
ings to hear, that you are dissatisfied or complaining at 
what I really could not avoid. 

As fife is always uncertain, and common prudence 
dictates to every man the necessity of settling his tem- 
poral concerns, while it is in his power, and while the 
mind is calm and undisturbed, I have, since I came to 
this place (for I had not time to do it before I left

home) got Colonel Pendleton * to draft a will for me, 
by the directions I gave him, which will I now enclose. 
The provision made for you in case of my death will, I 
hope, be agreeable. 

I shall add nothing more, as I have several letters to 
write, but to desire that you will remember me to your 
friends, and to assure you that I am, with the most un- 
feigned regard, my dear Patsy, your aftectionate, &.c. 



TO THE CAPTAINS OF SEVERAL INDEPENDENT"^ 
COMPANIES IN VIRGINIA. 

Philadelphia, 20 June, 1775. 



■^ ~- y^l»vf> Gentlemen, 

,v, . !'-'/<.- I am now about to bid adieu to the companies under 

your respective commands, at least for a while. I have 
launched into a wide and extensive field, too boundless 
for my abilities, and far, very far, beyond my experi- 
ence. I am called, by the unanimous voice of the Colo- 
j1- nies, to the command of the Continental army ; an 

^ I honor I did not aspire to ; an honor I was solicitous to 

-^\/v^ q"* avoid, upon a full conviction of my inadequacy to the 

f* -^ V importance of the service. The partiality of the Con- 

gress, however, assisted by a political motive, rendered 
my reasons unavailing, and I shall to-morrow set out 
for the camp near Boston. 

I have only to beg of you, therefore, before I go, 
(esj^ ecially as you did me the honor to put your compa- 
nies under my direction, and know not how soon you 
may be called upon in Virginia for an exertion of your

TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, 20 June, 1775. 

Dear Brother, 

I am now to bid adieu to you, and to every kind of 
domestic ease, for a while. 1 am embarked on a wide 
ocean, boundless in its prospect, and in which, perhaps, 
no safe harbour is to be found. I have been called upon 
by the unanimous voice of the Colonies to take the 
command of the Continental armj^ ; an honor I neither 
sought after, nor desired, as I am thoroughly convinced, 
that it requires greater abilities and much more experi- 

* The reply of the Independent Company of Alexandria to this letter 
is an evidence of the wanii attachment of his friends, at the same time 
that it is remarkable for the sentiments it expresses, even at so late a day, 
in regard to a conciliation with Great Britain. 

" Your favor of the 20th ultimo, notifying us of your intended departure 
for the camp, wc received, and, after transmitting copies to the different 
officers, to whom it was directed, we laid it before a full meeting of your 
company this day. At the same time that they deplore the unfortunate 
occasion, that calls you, their patron, friend, and worthy citizen, from them 
and your more tender connexions, they beg your acceptance of their most 
hearty congratulations upon your appointment to the supreme military 
command of the American confederated forces. Firmly convinced, Sir, 
of your zealous attachment to the riglits of your country, and those of 
mankind, and of your earnest desire, tliat harmony and good will should 
again take place lictween us and our parent state, we well know, that 
your every exertion «'ill bo invariably employed to preserve the one and 
effect the other. 

" We arc to inform you, Sir, by desire of the company, that, if at any 
time you shall judge it expedient for them to join the troops at Cambridge, 
or to march elsewhere, they will cheerfully do it. Wc now recommend 
you to the favor of Him, by whom kings reign and princes decree justice, 
wishing all your counsels and operations to be directed by his gracious 
providence to a happy and lasting union bntweon us and Groat Britain."

ence, than I am master of, to conduct a business so ex- 
tensive in its nature, and arduous in the execution. But 
the partiality of the Congress, joined to a pohtical mo- 
tive, really left me without a choice ; and I am now 
commissioned a General and Commander-in-chief of 
all the forces now raised, or to be raised, for the defence 
of the United Colonies. That I may discharge the 
trust to the satisfaction of my employers, is my first 
wish ; that I shall aim to do it, there remains htde doubt. 
How far I may succeed, is another point ; but this I am 
sure of, that, in the worst event, I shall have the conso- 
lation of knowing, if I act to the best of my judgment, 
that the blame ought to lodge upon the appointers, 
not the appointed, as it was by no means a thing of 
my own seeking, or proceeding from any hint of my 
friends. 

I am at liberty to inform you, that the Congress, in 
committee, have consented to a Continental currencj^, 
and have ordered two millions of dollars to be struck 
for payment of the troops, and other purposes, and have 
voted fifteen thousand men as a Continental army, which 
number will be augmented, as the strength of the British 
troops will be greater than was expected at the time of 
passing that vote. General Ward, General Lee, Gene- 
ral Schuyler, and General Putnam are appointed Major- 
Generals under me. The Brigadier-Generals are not 
yet appointed. Major Gates is made Adjutant-Gene- 
ral. * I expect to set out to-morrow for Boston, and 

* General Ward liad already been appointed, by the Provincial Con- 
gress of Massachusetts, commander of all the forces raised by tliat colony, 
and was now in Cambridge at the head of the army. Generals Lee and 
Schuyler were in Philadelpliia, and accompanied the Conmiandor-in-chiof 
to New York. Lee continued with him to head-quarters. Putnam was 
in Cambridge, commandinjr the T'onnecticut troops. Gates was at his 
seat in Berkley County, Virginia, but speedily joined the army.

nies of riflemen from this province, Maryland, and 
Virginia. For other articles of intelligence, I shall re- 
fer you to the papers, as the printers are diligent in 
collecting every thing that is stirring. 

I shall hope that my friends will visit and endeavour 
to keep up the spirits of my wife, as much as they can, 
for my departure will, I know, be a cutting stroke upon 
her ; and on this account alone I have many disagreea- 
able sensations. I hope that you and my sister, al- 
though the distance is great, Avill find so much time this 
summer as to spend a little of it at Mount Vernon.

ones, and I am your most affectionate brother.

was appointed major-general by the Congress, and before he received a 
commission in the American army. He had been a soldier from his youth, 
and liad seen mucli service in America during the French war, and after- 
wards in Europe. Wlien he received this appointment, he had been only 
about eighteen montlis in the colonies, but tliat time had mostly been spent 
in travelling. He thus formed many acquaintances, and inspired the public 
with a higli opinion of his military character. His friend Gates had in- 
duced liim to buy lands in Virginia, beyond the Blue Ridge, where he 
sometimes resided. Gates, also, had been an officer in tlie British army. 
He was a captain at Braddock's defeat, where he was wounded ; and he 
rose afterwards tn tlic rank of major, wiiich lie resigned, and retired 
from the service, jjurcliasing lands and settling liimself as a planter in 
Virginia. A friendly intercourse liad long subsisted between him ajid 
Washington. He was appointed Adjutant-General by the Congress, at 
the express solicitation of tlie Commander-in-chief, Avith tlic rank of 
brigadier. General Washington wrote to him immediately after liis ap- 
pointment, and Gates replied in very cordial tenns, adding in con- 
clusion ;—" I will not intrude more upon your time, only to assure you, 
tliat I shall not lose a moment in paying you my personal attendance, with 
the greatest respect for your cliaractcr, and tlie sincerest attachment to

previously, just before Washington left home for the Continental Con- 
gress.

TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CONTINENTAL CONGRESS, 
PHILADELPHIA. 

New York, 25 June, 177.5. 

tTLC-t, A^/^ ^^ Gentlemen, 

«> . ' r. . The rain on Friday afternoon and Saturday, the ad- 

vice of several gentlemen of the Jerseys and this city, 
by no means to cross Hudson's River at the lower ferry, 
and some other occurrences too trivial to mention, which 
happened on the road, prevented my arrival at this 
place, until the afternoon of this day.* 

* The following is an extract from the Journals of the New York 
Provincial Congress. 

" June, ^5th. — A letter from General Schuyler being read, dated at 
New Brunswick, June 24th, inforaiing this Congress that General Wash- 
ington, with his retinue, would be at Newark this morning, and requesting 
this Congress to send some of its members to meet him, and advise the 
most proper place for him to cross the Hudson River on liis way to New 
York; 

" Ordered, that Messrs. Smith, Hobart, Gouverneur Morris, and Richard 
Montgomery go immediately to Newark, and recommend to General 
Washington the place, which they shall think most prudent for him to 
cross at." 

News came at the same time, that Governor Tryon was in the harbour, 
just arrived from England, and would land that day. The Congress were 
a good deal embarrassed to determine how to act on tl)is occasion ; for 
thougii they had thrown off all allegiance to the authority of their 
governor, yet they professed to maintain loyalty to his person. They 
finally ordered a colonel so to dispose of his militia companies, that they 
might be in a condition to receive " either the Generals, or Governor 
Tryon, whichever should first arrive, and wait on both as well as circum- 
stances would allow." Events proved less perplexing than had been 
apprehended, as General Washington arrived several hours previous to 
the landing of Governor Tryon. 

Before General Washington left Philadelphia, ho reviewed in that city 
several companies of infantry, rangers, riflemen, artillery, and a troop of 
light-horse, amounting in all to two thousand men under arms. They 
escorted him out of the city, and the troop of light-horse ac*>mpanied him 
to New York Ho remained in New York till the 2(3th, when he departed 
under the escort of several military companies, passed the night at Kings- 
bridge, and the next morning ))roceeded on his journey. The Philadel- 
phia light-horse left him at Kingsbridge, and roturneil.

In the morning, after giving General Schuyler such 
orders, as, from the result of my inquiry into matters 
here, appear necessary, 1 shall set out on my journey to 
the camp at Boston, and shall proceed with all the des- 
patch in my powei-. Powder is so essential an article, 
that I cannot help again repeating the necessity of a 
supply. The camp at Boston, from the best account I 
can get from thence, is but very poorly supplied. At 
this place, they have scarce any. How they are provid- 
ed at General Wooster's camp, I have not been able 
yet to learn.* 

Governor Tryon is arrived, and General Schuyler 
is directed to advise you of the line of conduct he 
moves in. I fear it will not be very favorable to the 
American cause. 

I have only to add, that I am, with the greatest re- 
spect and regard, gentlemen, your most obedient and 
obliged humble servant. 

* General Wooster commanded the forces, which liad been raised by 
Connecticut, and which were stationed on the shores of Long Island 
Sound, to protect the southern borders of that colony. On the 1.5th of 
June, a rumor having been spread, that a regiment of British troops 
was? soon to be landed in the city of New York from Ireland, the Pro- 
vincial Congress invited Genera! Wooster to march witliin five miles of 
the city for its defence, and while there to be under the command of the 
Continental Congress, or that of New York. This request being ap- 
proved by the government of Connecticut, General Wooster marcliod 
eighteen hundred men to the neighbourhood of the city, on the 28th of 
June, where he remained several weeks. — MS. Jovmal of the J^Tew 
York Provincial Congrcsn. 

In reply to General Wooster's letter of consent, the Congress add ; — ■ 
" We beg leave to testify to you our high sense of the readiness, which 
you show to assist our colony. That honest zeal, which inspirits tlie 
bosom of our countrymen in Connecticut, commands our admiration 
and praise."

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, Sunday, 25 June, 1775; 
5 o'clock, P. M. 

Sir, 

Upon my arrival here this afternoon, I was informed 
that an express was in town, from the provincial camp 
in Massachusetts Bay ; and having seen, among the pa- 
pers in his possession, a letter directed to you as Presi- 
dent of the Congress, I have taken the liberty to open 
it. I was induced to take that liberty by several gen- 
tlemen of New York, who were anxious to know the 
particulars of the affair of the 17th instant,* and agree- 
ably to the orders of many members of the Congress, 
who judged it necessary, that I should avail myself of 
the best information in the course of my journey. 

You will find, Sir, by that letter, a great want of 
powder in the provincial army, which I sincerely hope 
the Congress will supply as speedily and as effectually 
as in their power. One thousand pounds in weight 
were sent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, 
from this city, which has left this place almost destitute 
of that necessary article ; there being at this time, from 
the best information, not more than four barrels of pow- 
der in the city of New York. I propose to set ofl" for 
the provincial camp to-morrow, and will use all possible 
despatch to join the forces there. 

Please to make my compliments to the gentlemen of 
the Congress ; and believe me to be. Sir, your obliged 
friend and humble servant.

Sir, 

You are to take upon you the command of all the

that the orders of the Continental Congress are carried 
into execution, with as much precision and exactness as 
possible. 

For your better government therein, you are here-

me by that honorable body. Such parts as are within 
the line of your duty, you will please to pay particular 
attention to. Delay no time in occupying the several 
posts, recommended by the Provincial Congress of this 
colony, and putting them in a fit posture to answer the 
end designed; nor delay any time in securing the stores, 
which are, or ought to have been, removed from this city 
by order of the Continental Congress.

nor, I should have no difficulty in ordering them, if 
the Continental Congress were not sitting; but as this is 
the case, and the seizing of a governor quite a new 
thing, and of great importance, I must refer you to that 
body for direction, should his Excellency make any mo- 
tion towards increasing the strength of the Tory party, 
or arming them against the cause in which we are em- 
barked. In like manner, watch the movements of the 
Indian agent. Colonel Guy Johnson, and prevent, as far 
as you can, the effect of his influence to our prejudice 
with the Indians. * Obtain the best information you 
can of the temper and disposition of those people, and 
also of the Canadians, that a proper line may be mark-

future operation. 

The posts on Lake Champlain you will please to 
have properly supplied with provisions and ammunition ; 
and this I am persuaded you will aim at doing on the 
best terms, to prevent our good cause from sinking 
under a heavy load of expense. You will be pleased, 
also, to make regular returns to me, and to the Continen- 
tal Congress, once a month, and oftener as occurrences 
may require, of the forces under your command, and of 
your provisions and stores, and give me the earliest ad- 
vices of every piece of intelligence, which you shall 
judge of importance to be speedily known. Your own 
good sense must govern you in all matters not par- 
ticularly pointed out, as I do not wish to circumscribe 
you within narrow limits. I am Sir, &c.

ANSWER TO AN ADDRESS OF THE PROVINCIAL 
CONGRESS OF MASSACHUSETTS.* 

4 July, 1773. 

Gentlemen, 

Your kind congratulations on my appointment and 
^Zo-tc t-flt^C arrival, demand my warmest acknowledgments, and will 
ever be retained in grateful remembrance. 

In exchanging the enjoyments of domestic life lor 
the duties of my present honorable but arduous station, 
I only emulate the virtue and public spirit of the whole 
province of Massachusetts Bay, which, with a firmness 
and patriotism without example in modern history, has 
sacrificed all the comforts of social and pohtical life, in 
support of the rights of mankind, and the welfare of 
our common country. My highest ambition is to be the 
happy instrument of vindicating those rights, and to 
see this devoted province again restored to peace, liber- 
ty, and safety. 

The short space of time, which has elapsed since my 
arrival, does not permit me to decide upon the state of 
the army. The course of human affairs forbids an ex- 
pectation, that troops formed under such circumstances 
should at once possess the order, regularity, and disci- 
pline of veterans. Whatever deficiencies there may 
be, will, I doubt not, soon be made up by the activity 

ted into your hands, and reassume the character of our jvorthiesti citizen." •'"^ 'M^ 

This was a broad Iiint to a military conunander-in-chief, but it was 
very delicately and appropriately met by Washington in his reply ; and 
it is worthy of remark, tliat this early declaration was literally and cor- 
dially verified on his part throughout the whole progress of the war, and 
especially at its close. 

* General Washington arrived in Cambridge on the 2d of July, and 
took command of the army on the 3d. The Massachusetts Congress 
were at this time convened at Watcrtown, three miles from Cambridge, 
and on his arrival they honored hiin with a congratulatory address. — See

and zeal of the officcr.s, ami the docility and obedience 
of the men. These qualities, united with their native 
bravery and spirit, will uflbrd a happy presage of suc- 
cess, and put a final period to those distresses, which 
now overwhelm this once happy country. 

I most sincerely thank you, Gentlemen, for your 
declarations of readiness at all times to assist me in the 
discharge of the duties of my station. They ai-e so 
complicated and extended, that I shall need the assist- 
ance of every good man, and lover of his country. I 
therefore repose the utmost confidence in your aid. 
In return for your affectionate wishes to myself, permit 
me to say, that I earnestly implore that divine Being, in 
whose hands are all human events, to malje you and 
your constituents as distingTiished in private and public 
happiness, as you have been by ministerial oppression, 
and by private and public distress.

CONGRESS OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Head-Cluarters, Cambridge, 10 July, 1775. 

Sir, 
After much difficulty and delay, I have procured TVI^CL , ^^/ST^T^. 
such returns of the state of the army, as will enable us ST. /^ii 
to form a judgment of its strength. It is with great 
concern I find it to be very inadequate to our general 
expectations, and the duties that may be required of it. 
The number of men fit for duty in the forces raised in 
this province, including all the outposts and artillery, 
does not amount to nine thousand. The troops raised 
in the other colonies are more complete, but yet fall 
short of their establishment ; so (hat, upon the whole, I 
cannot estimate the present army at more than fourteen

thoLisuiid tive hundred men capable of duty. 1 have 
the satisfaction to find the troops, both in camp and 
quarters, very healthy ; so that the deficiency must 
arise from the regiments never having been filled up to 
the establishment, and from the number of men on fur- 
lough ; but the former cause is by much the most con- 
siderable. Under all these circumstances, I yesterday 
called a council of war, and enclosed I send you an ex- 
tract of our determination, so far as it respects the prov- 
ince of Massachusetts Bay.* Your own prudence will 
suggest the necessity of secrecy on this subject, as we 
have the utmost reason to believe, that the enemy sup- 
pose our numbers much greater than they are, an error 
which it is not our interest to remove. 

The great extent of our lines, and the uncertainty 
where may be the point of attack, added to the ne- 
cessity of immediate support, have induced me to order 
that horses ready saddled should be kept at several 
posts, in order to bring the most early intelligence of 
any movement of the enemy. For this purpose, I 
shoidd be glad that ten horses may be provided as soon 
(£-(/v\.f ^g possible. I have the honor to be, Sir, &c. t 

P. S. As I am informed, that the Congress purposes 
to rise immediately, I should be glad to know what 
committees are to be left, or upon whom the executive 
business will devolve, t

be increased as soon as possible, that an officer shoidd be sent from

which they respectively belonged, and that the General should apply to 
the Provincial Congress for a temporary reinforcement.

PaktH.I the AMKRICAN R 10 VOLUTION . 17 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

C;uiip at C;unbndj;e, 10 July, 1775. 

Sir, 

I arrived safe at this place on the 3d instant, after a K K^^' 
journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and re- 
tarded by necessary attentions to the successive civili- Tii'^f- 
ties, which accompanied nie in my whole route. H^ 

Upon my arrival, I immediately visited the several 
posts occupied by our troops; and, as soon as the 
weather permitted, reconnoitred those of the enemy. 
I found the latter strongly intrenching on Bunker's Hili, 
about a mile from Charlestown, and advanced about hall 
a mile from the place of the late action, with their sen- 
tries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on 
this side of the narrowest part of the neck leading from 
this place to Charlestown. Three floating batteries lie 
in Mystic River near their camp, and one twenty-gun 
ship below the ferry -place between Boston and Charles- 
town. They have also a battery on Cops Hill, on the 
Boston side, which much annoyed our troops in the late 
attack. Upon Roxbury Neck, they are also deeply 
intrenched and strongly fortified. Their advanced 
guards, till last Saturday, occupied Browai's house;|, J^idAAJ^-^^ 
about a mile from Roxbury meeting-house, and twenty 
rods from their lines ; but, at that time, a party from xl.©© HH^t^w^I ■ 
General Thomas's camp siu-prised the guard, drove , "^ 
them in, and burned the houses. The bulk of their 
army, commanded by General Howe, lies on Bunker's 
Hill, and the remamder on Roxbury Neck, except the ^ "" 

light-horse, and a few men in the town of Boston. 

On oiu- side, we have thrown up intrenchments on '^' j« 
Winter and Prospect Hills, the enemy's camp in full 
view, at the distance of litde more than a mile. Such 
intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have

18 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt. A3. 

since my arrival taken care to strengthen, down to 
Sewall's farm, where a strong intrencliment has been 
thrown up. At Roxbury, General Thomas has thrown 
up a strong work on the hill, about two hundred yards 
above the meeting-house ; which, with the brokenness 
of the gi'ound, and a great number of rocks, has made 
that pass very secure. The troops raised in New 
Hampshire, with a regiment from Rhode Island, occupy 
Winter Hill ; a part of those from ConnecUcut, under 
General Putnam, are on Prospect Hill. The troops in 
this town are entirely of the Massachusetts ; the re- 
mainder of the Rhode Island men ai'e at Sewall's farm. 
Two regiments of Connecticut, and nine of the Massa- 
chusetts, are at Roxbury. The residue of the army, to 
the number of about seven hundred, are posted in sev- 
eral small towns along the coast, to prevent the depre- 
dations of the enemy. 

Upon the whole, I think myself authorized to say, 
that, considering the great extent of line and the nature 
of the ground, we are as well secured, as could be ex- 
pected in so short a time, and with the disadvantages 
we labor under. These consist in a want of engineers to 
construct proper works and direct the men, a want of 
tools, and a sufficient number of men to man the works 
in case of an attack. You will observe, by the proceed- 
ings of the council of war, which I have the honor to 
enclose, that it is our unanimous opinion, to hold antl 
defend these works as long as possible. The discour- 
agement it would give the men, and its contrary eflects 
on the ministerial troops, thus to abandon our encamp- 
ment m iheir face, formed with so much labor and ex- 
pense, added to the certain destruction of a considerable 
and valuable extent of country, and our uncertainty of 
finding a place in all respects so capable of making a 
stand, are leading reasons for this determination. At 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 19 

the same time we are very sensible of the difficulties, 
which attend the defence of lines of so great extent, 
and the dangers, which may ensue from such a division 
of the army.* 

My earnest wish to comply wiih the instructions of 
the Congress, in maldng an early and complete return 
of the state of the army, has led to an involuntary de- 
lay of addressing you ; which has given me much con- 
cern. Having given orders for that purpose immediately 
on my arrival, and not then so well apprised of the im- 
perfect obedience, which had been paid to those of the 
like nature from General W^ai-d, I was led fro.ni day to 
day to e.xpect they would come in, and therefore de- 
tained the messenger. They are not now so complete 
as I could wish ; but much allowance is to be made for 
inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been 
taken (not given) on this subject. These reasons, I 
flatter myself, will no longer exist ; and, of consequence, 
more regularity and exactness will in future prevail. 
This, with a necessary attention to the lines, the move- 
ments of the ministerial troops, and our immediate secu- 
rity, must be my apology, v.'hich I beg you to lay before 
Congress with the utmost duty and respect, f 

We labor under great disadvantages for want of tents ; 



* The first council of war was held at head-quarters on the 9th of July, 
attoiuled by the major-generals and the brigadiers. The council decided, 
tliat, from tiie best information, the number of the enemy's forces in Boston 
should be estimated at eleven tlioiisand five hundred men. On tlie ques- 
tion whether it was expedient to defend the posts now occupied, or retire 
farther into the country, it was unanimously determined to defend the 
posts. It was also agreed, that twenty-two tiiousand men at least were 
necessary to act agauist the supposed force of the enemy, and that meas- 
ures ought to be immediately taken to increase the army by recruits. It 
was further agreed, that, if the troops should be attacked, and routed by 
tlie enemy, the place of rendezvous should be Wales's Hill, in the rear 
of the Roxbury lines.

for, though they have been helped out by a collection 
of sails from the seaport towns, the number is far short 
of our necessities. The colleges and houses of this 
town are necessarily occupied by the troops ; which 
affords another reason for keeping our present station. 
But I most sincerely wish the whole army was properly 
J, provided to take the field, as I am well assured, that, 

v**^*^^ ( « besides greater expedition and activity in case of alarm, 

it would highly conduce to health and discipline. As 
materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to 
recommend the procuring of a farther supply from 
Philadelphia, as soon as possible. 

I should be extremely deficient in gratitude, as well 
as justice, if I did not take the first opportunity to ac- 
knowledge the readiness and attention, which the Pro- 
vincial Congress and different committees have shown, 
to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as 
possible.* But there is a vital and inherent principle 
of delay incompatible with military service, in transact- 
ing business through such numerous and different chan- 
nels. I esteem it, therefore, my duty to represent the 
inconvenience, which must unavoidably ensue from a 
dependence on a number of persons for supplies ; and

public service Avill not be best promoted by appointing a 
commissary -general for these purposes. We have a 
striking instance of the preference of such a mode, in 
the establishment of Connecticut, as their troops are 
extremely well provided under the direction of Mr. 
Trumbull, and he has at difl'erent times assisted others 
with various articles. Should my sentiments happily 
coincide with those of your Honors on this subject, I 
beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper 
person for this department. In the arrangement of 
troops collected under such circumstances, and upon 
the spur of immediate necessity, several appointments 
have been omitted, which appear to be indispensably 
necessary for the good government of the army, particu- 
larly a quartermaster-general, a commissary of musters, 
and a commissai-y of artillery. These I must particu- 
larly recommend to the notice and provision of the 
Congress.* 

I find myself already much embarrassed, for want of 
a military chest. These embarrassments will increase 
every day. I must therefore most earnestly request, that 
money may be forwarded as soon as possible. The 
want of this most necessary article will, I fear, produce 
great inconveniences, if not prevented by an early at- 
tention. I find the army in general, and the troops 
raised in Massachusetts in particular, very deficient in 
necessary clothing. Upon inquiry, there appears no 
probability of obtaining any suppUes in this quarter; 
and, on the best consideration of this matter I am able 
to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting-shirts, 
not less than ten thousand, would in a great degree re- 
move this difficulty, in the cheapest and quickest man- 
ner. I know nothing, in a speculative view, more trivial,

ot these officers was left to the Commander-in-chief.

yet which, if put in practice, would have a happier ten- 
dency to unite the men, and abolish those provincial 
distinctions, that lead to jealousy and dissatisfaction. 

In a former part of this letter, I mentioned the Avant 

of engineers. I can hardly express the disappointment 

I have experienced on this subject, the skill of those we 

have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere 

^< ^- CC^tKAA manual exercise of cannon ; whereas the war in which 

^«<w\i, XC SiJit- '^^'6 ^re engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending 

- A ^ ^,,^^^ the duties of the field, and fortification. If any persons 

^ " thus qualified are to be found in the southern colonies, 

^ ' it would be of great public service to forward them with 

all expedition. 

Upon the article of ammunition, I must reecho the 
former complaints on this subject. We are so exceed- 
ingly destitute, that our artillery will be of little use, 
without a supply both large and seasonable. What we 
have must be reserved for the small arms, and that 
managed with the utmost frugality. 

I am very sorry to observe, that the appointment of 
general oflicers, in the provinces of Massachusetts and 
Connecticut, has not corresponded with the wishes and 
judgment of either the civil or military. The great dis- 
satisfaction expressed on this subject, and the apparent 
danger of throwing the whole army into the utmost dis- 
order, together with the strong representations made by 
the Provincial Congress, have induced me to retain the 
commissions in my hands until the pleasure of the Con- 
tinental Congress should be further known, except 
General Putnam's, which was given the day I came to 
the camp, and before I was apprized of these disgusts. 
In such a step, I must beg the Congress will do me the 
justice to believe, that I have been actuated solely by a 
regard to the public good. 

I have not, nor could I have, any private attachments ; 



Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 23 

every gentleman in appointment was a stranger to me, 
but from character; I must, therefore, rely upon the 
candor and indulgence of Congress, for their most fa- 
vorable construction of my conduct in this particular. 
General Spencer's disgust was so great at General Put- 3^ ^ ^ , , 
nam's promotion, that he left the army without visiting j^ n'S-T 
me, or making known his intention in any respect. 

General Pomroy had also retired before my arrival, 
occasioned, as it is said, by some disappointment from 
the Provincial Congress. General Thomas is much es- Jx (aJ-vi>-' 
teemed, and most earnestly desired to continue in the . , ^yA 
service ; and, as far as my opportunities have enabled 
me to judge, I must join in the general opinion, that he 
is an able, good officer ; and his resignation Avould be a 
public loss. The postponing of him to Pomroy and 
Heath, whom he has commanded, would make his con- 
tinuance very difficult, and probably operate on his 
mind, as the like circumstance did on that of Spencer.* 

The state of the army you will find ascertained with 
tolerable precision in the returns, which accompany this 
letter. Upon finding the number of men to fall so far 



* Eight brigadier-generals for the Continental army were chosen by 
Congress on the 9Qd of Juno, in the following order. Scth Pomroy, of 
Massachusetts ; Ricliard Montgomery, of New York ; David Wooster, of 
Connecticut : William Heath, of Massachusetts ; .Toseph Spencer, of Con- 
necticut : .John Tliomas, of Massachusetts ; .lohn Sullivan, of New Hamp- 
shire ; Nathanac! Greene, of Rhode Island. The commissions for these offi- 
cers had been brought to camp by General Washington. He found great 
uneasiness prevailing, as to the comparative rank confeiTcd by these ap- 
pointments. The difficulties were in some degree removed by Pomroy's 
declining to serve, and by Spencer's consenting to take rank after Putnam. 
By this arrangement Thomas was made the first brigadier-general. — 
Journal of Congress, Jaltf I9th. — Pomroy behaved with great courage 
at the battle of Bunker's Hdl, and altliough he declined joining the Conti- 
nental army, yet he headed the militia of his neighbourhood, wlio marclied 
to the Hudson River, when New .Tersey was overrun by the enemy. He 
never returned from that e.xpedition. He died at Peekskill in New York.

short of the estabhsliment, and below all expectation, I 
immediately called a council of the general officers, 
whose opinion, as to the mode of filling up the regi- 
ments, and providing for the present exigency, I have the 
honor of enclosing, togedier with the best judgment we 
are able to form of the ministerial troops. From the 
number of boys, deserters, and negroes, that have been 
enlisted in the troops of this province, I entertain some 
doubts whether the number required can be raised 
here ; and all the general officers agree, that no depend- 
ence can be put on the militia, for a continuance in 
camp, or regularity and discipHne during the short time 
they may stay. This unhappy and devoted province 
has been so long in a state of anarchy, and the yoke of 
ministerial oppression has been laid so heavily on it, that 
great allowances are to be made for troops raised under 
such circumstances. The deficiency of numbers, disci- 
pline, and stores, can only lead to this conclusion, that 
their spirit has exceeded their strength. But, at the 
same time, I would humbly submit to the consideration 
of Congress the propriety of making some further pro- 
vision of men from the other colonies. If these regi- 
ments should be completed to their establishment, the 
dismission of those unfit for duty, on account of their age 
and character, would occasion a considerable reduction ; 
and, at all events, they have been enhsted upon such 
terms, that they may be disbanded when other troops 
arrive. But should my apprehensions be realized, and 
the regiments here not be ffiled up, the public cause 
would suffer by an absolute dependence upon so doubt- 
ful an event, unless some provision is made against such 
a disappointment. 

It requires no military skill to judge of the difficulty 
of introducing proper discipline and subordination into 
an army, while we ha\ e the enemy in \\ew, and are in

daily expectation of an attack ; but it is of so much im- 
portance, that every cUbrt will be made to this end, 
which time and circumstances wiU admit. In the mean 
time, I have a sincere pleasure in observing, that tliere 
ai-e materials for a good army, a great number of able- 
bodied men, active, zealous in the cause, and of un- 
questionable courage. 

I am now. Sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor of the 28th of June, enclosing the resolutions of 
Congress of the 27th, and a copy of a letter from the 
Committee of Albany ; to all which I shall pay due 
attention. 

Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in 
good health. 

My best abilities are at all times devoted to the ser- 
vice of my country ; but I feel the weight, importance, 
and variety of my present duties too sensibly, not to 
Avish a more immediate and frequent communication 
with the Congress. I fear it may often happen, in the 
course of our present operations, that I shall need that 
assistance and direction from them, which time and 
distance will not allow me to receive. 

Since writing the above, I have also to acknowledge ^ „-^^:^ >vu^ k 
your favor of the 4th instant by Fessenden,' and the i, • i. ^u •■ x2a,' 
receipt of the commissions and articles of war. Among •'^^ 

the other returns, I have also sent one of our killed, '*^*' r' ^^ 
wounded, and missing, in the late action ;* but have 
been able to procure no certain account of the loss of the

published by tlie Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, tlie loss was one ,i i A 

hundred and forty-five kiUed and missing, and three hundred and four • ' 73 i v 
wounded. About thirty of the first number were wounded and taken 
prisoners. By General Gage's oflicial return, the killed and missing of 
the British were two hundred and twenty-six, and tlie wounded eight hun- 
dred and twenty-eight, in all one thousand and fifty four. — AlmoTt's Re- I

ministerial troops. My best intelligence fixes it at about 
five hundred killed and six or seven hundred wounded ; 
but it is no more than conjecture, the utmost pains 
being taken on their side to conceal their loss. 

Having ordered the commanding officer to give me 
the earliest intelligence of every motion of the enemy 
by land or water, discernible from the heights of his 
camp, I this instant, as I was closing my letter, received 
the enclosed from the brigade-major. The design ot 
this manoeuvre I know not ; perhaps it may be to 
make a descent somewhere along the coast ; it may be 
for New York ; or it may be practised as a deception 
on us. I thought it not improper however to mention 
the matter to you; I have done the same to the com- 
manding officer at New-York ; and I shall let it be 
known to the Committee of Safety here, so that intelli- 
gence may be communicated, as they shall think best, 
along the sea-coast of this government. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
I was exceeding glad to receive a letter from you, as 
I always shall be whenever it is convenient; though 
perhaps my hurry, till such time as matters are drawn 
a little out of the chaos they appear in at present, will 
not suffer me to write you such full and satisfactory an- 
swers, or give such clear and precise accounts of our 
situation and views, as I could wish, or you miglu ex-

ly by the desire of the different townships through 
which I travelled of showing respect to the general of

your armies, I arrived here on this day week ; since 
which I have been laboring with as much assiduity by 
fair and threatening means, to obtain returns of oui- 
strength in this camp and Roxbury and their depen- 
dencies, as a man could do, and never have been able 
to accomplish the matter till this day ; and now, I will 
not answer for the correctness of them, although I have 
sent several of the reaiimental returns back more than 
once to have mistakes rectified. 

I do not doubt but the Congress will think me very 
remiss in not writing to them sooner ; but you may rely 
on it yourself, and I beg you to assure them, that it has 
never been in my power till this day to comply with 
their orders. Could I have conceived, that what ought, 
and, in a regular army, would have been done in an hour, 
would employ eight days, I should have sent an ex- 
press on the second morning after I arrived, with a 
general account of things ; but expecting in the morning 
to receive the returns in the evening, and in the evening 
surely to find them in the morning, and at last getting 
them full of imperfections, I have been drilled on from 
day to day, till I am ashamed to look back at the time, 
whicli has elapsed since my arrival here. You will pci- 
ceive by the returns, that we have but about sixteen 
thousand effective men in all this department, whereas, 
by the accounts which I received from even the first 
officers in command, I had no doubt of finding between 
eighteen and twenty thousand ; out of these there are 
only fourteen thousand fit for duty. So soon as I Avas 
able to get this state of the army, and came to the 
knowledge of our weakness, I immediately summoned 
a council of war, the result of which you will see, as it 
is enclosed to the Congress. Between you and me, I 
think we are in an exceedingly dangerous situation, as 
our numbers are not much larger than we suppose those 



28 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [tEt. 43. 

of the enemy to be, from the best accounts we are able to 
get. They are situated in such a manner, as to be drawn 
to any point of attack, without our having an hour's 
previous notice of it, if the General will keep his own 
counsel ; whereas we are obliged to be guarded at all 
points, and know not where, with precision, to look for 
them. 

I should not, I think, have made choice of the pres- 
ent posts, in the first instance, although I believe the 
comm.unication between the town and country could 
not have been so well cut off without them ; and, as 
much labor has been bestowed in throwing up lines, and 
making redoubts ; as Cambridge, Roxbury, and Water- 
town must be immediately exposed to the mercy of the 
enemy, were we to retreat a little further into the coun- 
try ; as it would give a general dissatisfaction to this 
colony, dispirit our own people, and encourage the 
enemy, to remove at this time to another place ; we have 
for these reasons resolved in council to maintain our 
ground if we can. Our lines on Winter and Prospect 
Hills, and those of the enemy on Bunker's Hill, are in 
full view of each other, a mile distant, our advance 
guards much nearer, and the sentries almost near 
enough to converse ; at Roxbury and Boston Neck it 
is the same. Between these, we are obliged to guard 
several of the places at which the enemy may land. 
They have strongly fortified, or will fortify in a few 
days, their camps and Bunker's Hill ; after which, and 
when their newly landed troops have got a litde re- 
freshed, we shall look for a visit, if they mean, as we 
are told they do, to come out of their lines. Their 
great command of artillery, and adequate stores of pow- 
der, give them advantages, which we have only to la- 
ment the want of

whom we every hour expect an attack, is exceedingly 
difficult and dangerous. It' tliino:s therefore ishould not 
turn out as the Congress would wish, I hope they will 
make proper allowances. I can only promise and as- 
sure them, that my whole time is devoted to their ser- 
vice, and that as far as my judgment goes, they shall 
have no cause to complain. I need not tell you, that 
this letter is written in much haste ; the fact will suffi- 
ciently appear from the face of it. I thought a hasty 
letter would please you better than no letter, and, there- 
fore, I shall offijr no further apology, but assure you, 
that, with sincere regard for my fellow laborers with 
you, and Dr. Shippen's family, I am, dear Sir, your 
most affectionate servant.

Notwithstanding Governor Tryon's plausible beha- 
viour, I recommend it to you to watch him narrowly ; 
and as any unlucky change of affairs on our part may 
produce a change in him, of his present unexceptiona-

of such a change, pursue the advice given in my last

me, are not sufficient to answer the demand I have for 
them, there being at least one thousand officers in this 
department, and not more than five hundred commis- 
sions in my possession. As you are so much nearer to 
Philadelphia than I am, I request you to apply to Con- 
gress for as many as you may want.

up additional works. We have thrown up several lines 
and redoubts between Mystic River and Dorchester 
Point, to pi'event their making way into the country, 
and in a few days we shall be well prepared to receive 
them, in case a sortie is attempted. 

I sincerely thank you for your attention to the direc-

Cambridge, 18 July, 1775. 
SiK, 

Allow me to return you my sincere thanks, for the 
kind wishes and favorable sentiments expressed in 
yours of the 13th instant. As the cause of our com- 
mon country calls us both to an active and dangerous 
duty, I trust that Divine Providence, which wisely or- 
ders the affairs of men, will enable us to discharge it 
with fidelity and success. The uncorrupted choice of 
a brave and free people has raised you to deserved 
eminence. That the blessings of health, and the sdll 
greater blessing of long continuing to govern such a 
people, may be yours, is the sincere wish of, Sir, 
your, &,c.* 

* Governor Trumbull was one of tlie firmest patriots and best men, 
tliat liis country has produced. He was at this time sixty-five years old, 
having been born in the year 1710, yet no man engaged with more zeal 
and activity in tlie common cause. So true was he to the principles of 
liberty, and such was the confidence of his fellow citizens in his talents 
and integrity, tliat, although first appointed Governor in 17C9, several f^ > > . /—<

great unanimity to the same station till the end of tlie revolution, when, at 
the age of seventy-three, he declined a further elcctioiF' His services 
were of very great importance tliroughout tlie whole war, not only in 
regulating the civil afiairs of Connecticut, but in lieepiiig alive a military 
ardor among the people, and thus promoting efficiency and promptness of 
action in the forces contributed from time to time by that state. General 
Washington relied on him as one of his main pillars of support. The 
following e.xtracts firom Governor Trumbull's letter, to which tlie above is 
an answer, will show something of the spirit prevailing at that day, as well 
as the religious cast ol the writer's mind ;

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Cambridge, 18 July, 1775. 

Sir, 

It is with no small concern, that I find the arrange- 
ment of general officers, made by the Continental Con- 
gress, has produced much dissatisfaction. As the army- 
is upon a general establishment, their right, to super- 
sede and control a Provincial one, must be unquestion- 
able ; and, in such a cause, I should hope every post 
would be deemed honorable, which gave a man an op- 
portunity to serve his country. 

A representation from the Congress of this province, 
with such remarks as occurred to me on this subject, is 
now before the Continental Congress. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to assure you, that, unbiassed by any 
private attachments, I shall studiously endeavour to 
reconcile their pretensions to their duty, and so dispose 
them, as to prevent, as far as possible, any inconvenien- 
ces to the public service from this competition. I have 
the honor to be, &c. 



always to be made the object of government ; justice is firm and per- 
manent. 

" His Majesty's ministers have artfully induced the Parliament to join 
in their measures, to prosecute the dangerous and increasing difference 
between Great Britain and these colonies witli rigor and military force ; 
whereby the latter are driven to an absolute necessity to defend their 
rights and properties, by raising forces for their security. The honorable 
Congress have, with one united voice, appointed you to the high station 
you possess. The Supreme Director of aU events has caused a wonderful 
union of hearts and counsels to subsist amongst us. Now, tlierofore, be 
strong and very courageous. May the God of the armies of Israel show- 
er down the blessings of liis divine providence on you, give you wisdom 
and fortitude, cover your head in the day of battle and danger, add suc- 
cess, convince our enemies of their mistaken measures, and that all their 
attempts to deprive these colonies of their inestimable constitutional rights 
and liberties are injurious and vain."

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Ciunp iit Cambridge, 20 July, 1775. ^?yi C-t ^ 0-^~ 
Sin, _5JJ} 

Since 1 did mysell' the honor of addressing you the 
14th instant, I have received advice from Governor 
Trumbull, that the Assembly of Connecticut had voted, 

and that they are now raising, two regiments of seven \^h^ G-tWw e»w ¥ / 
hundred men each, to join this army in consequence of 
an application from the Provincial Congress of Massa- 
chusetts Bay. The Rhode Island Assembly has also (p^ _ j (Ih^^^trAi V I i 
made an augmentation ibr this purpose. These rein- , ^y -. ,-r-. 
forcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, ' 

and such recruits as may come in to fill up the regi- 
ments here, will, I apprehend, compose an army suffi- 
ciently strong to oppose any force, which may be brought 
against us at present. I am very sensible, that the heavy 
expense, necessarily attendant upon this campaign, will 
call for the utmost frugality and care, and I would there- 
fore, if possible, avoid enlisting one unnecessary man. 
As this is the first certain account of the destination of 
these new-raised troops, I thought proper to communi- 
cate my sentiments as early as possible, lest the Con- 
gress should act upon my letter of the 1 0th, and raise 
troops in the southern colonies, which, in my present 
judgment, may be dispensed with. 

Next to the more immediate and pressing duties of 
putting our lines in as secure a state as possible, atten-

subdividetl into brigades, under their respective bi-iga- 
diers. But the difficulty arising from the arrangement 
ot" the general officers, and waiting the farther proceed- 
mgs of the Congress on this subject, have much retarded 
my progress in this most necessary work. I should be 
very happy to i-eceive their final commands, as any de- 
termination would enable me to proceed in my plan.

General Folsom proposed also to retir'e. 

My iiisti'uctions from the honorable Congress direct, 
that no troops are to be disbanded without their ex- 
press direction, nor to be recruited to more than double 
the number of the enemy. Upon this subject I beg 
leave to represent, that, unless the regiments in this 
province are more successful in recruiting than I have 
reason to expect, a reduction of some of them will be 
highly necessary, as the public is put to the whole ex- 
pense of an establishment of officers, while the real 
strength of the regiment, which consists in the rank and 
file, is defective. In case of such a reduction, doubt- 
less some of the privates and all the officers would re- 
turn home ; but many of the former would go into the 
remaining regiments, and, having had some experience 
of service, would fill them up with useful men. I so 
plainly perceive the expense of this campaign will ex- 
ceed any calculation hitherto made, that I am particular- 
ly anxious to strike off every unnecessary charge. You 
will therefore, Sir, be pleased to favor me with explicit 
directions from the Congress, on the mode of this re- 
duction, if it shall appear necessary, that no time may 
be lost when such necessity appears.

' By a vote of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress (April 2Gth), 
Mr. Richard Derby of Salem was empowered to fit out his vessel, as a 
packet, to carry intelligence of the Lexington battle to England, and 
all charges were to be paid by the colony. It was commanded by Cap- 
tain John Derby, who arrived in London on the[29tinof May, having 
taken with him several copies of the Essex Gazctle, in'^which was con- 
tained tlio first published account of the affair at Lexington and Concord. 
This was reprinted and circulated in London tlie day atler his arrival, and 
gave tlie first notice of that event to tlie Englisli public. Captain 
Derby was summoned before tlie Privy CouncD, and examined, the 
ministry having received no despatches from General Gage confirming 
such a report. Nor did his letters arrive, till eleven days afterwards, 
althougli the vessel conveying them sailed four days previous to the de- 
parture of Captain Derby. Great excitement was produced throughout 
England, and the clamor grew loud against tlie ministers, because it was 
presumed that they concealed the official accounts, and wished to keep 
the people in ignorance. On the 10th of June, however, as soon as 
General Gage's official report readied Whitehall, it was jiublished. —

Captain Derby took witli hmi the original affidavits of the people in Lex-

Congress to Dr. Franklin, agent in England for Massachusetts. These 
identical papers are now in the Library of Harvard College. When 
Captain Derby arrived in London, Dr. Franklin had sailed for America, 
and he was at sea when the affair at Lexington took place. The papers 
were, therefore, handed to Arthur Lee, who was Dr. Franklin's successor. 
He retained them, and recently they have been deposited in tlie Library 
of the College, with other manuscripts, by Mr. R. H. Lee, of Virginia.

Dear Sir, 

I am particularly to acknowledge that part of your

of determining to join the army under my command. 
I need certainly make no professions of the pleasure I 
shall have in seeing you. At the same time I have to 
regret, that so litde is in my power to offer equal to 
Colonel Hancock's merits, and w'orthy of his accept-

Dear Sir, 

On the other side you will receive a copy of my last, 
dated at Philadelphia the 31st of May, and to which I 
refer. 

I .shall say very little in this letter, for two reasons ; 
first, because I have received no letter from you since 
the one dated in June, 1774, and therefore, having writ- 
ten often, can have nothing to answer ; but, principally, 
because I do not know whether it may ever get to your 
hands. If it should, the principal, indeed only design 
is to cover the seconds of those bills forwarded in my 
last. 

was dismissed from that command by General Gage. A curious corre- 
spondence on the subject is contained in the Boston Gazette, August 29tli, 

1774. It does not appear, that lie joined the army under Washington in 
any military capacity, as above proposed. 

pAn error of some consequence has crept into history, respecting tiie 
pro.ximate cause, which influenced the members of the Continental Con- 
gress in choosing Mr. Ilancocli to be president of that body. In Belsham's 
Memoirs of the Reigyi of George the Third (Vol. I. p. 318), it is intimated, 
that his proscription by General Gage procured him this honor. Mrs. War- 
ren, in ner History of the Revolution (Vol. I. p. 214), speaks with still more 
confidence, and says, " He was chosen to preside in the respectable as- 
sembly of delegates, avowedly on tlie sole principle of his having been 
proscribed by General Gage." But Hancock was chosen president of the 
Continental Congress on the 24th of May, two weeks before Gage'."! 
proclamation, proscribing liim and Samuel Adams, was issued, tliat instru- 
ment having first ap])earcd on tlie 12tl) nf Juno following. It is probable, 
that a main reason of his being chosen, in addition to the notoriety ac- ^"Vt<t^*-^ 

quired by the zealous part he had acted, was the circumstance of liis 
\v inning personal address, and his having been for some time president of 
tlie Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, by whicli he had become fa- 
miliar with the forms of business in a public body. This latter office ho 
continued to hold, after joining the Continental C\ingress. Dr. Joseph 
Warren was elected president pro trmporr, and discharged the duties of 
the station, till the day on which he was slain at Bunker's Hdl. —

You will, I presume, before this letter gets to hand, 
hear of my appointment to the command of the Conti- 
nental army. I arrived at this camp the 2d instant. 

You must, no doubt, also have heard of the engage- 
ment on Bunker's Hill the 17th ultimo; but as I am 
persuaded you will have a very erroneous account 
transmitted of the loss sustained on the side of the 
Provincials, I do assui'e you, upon my word, that our 
loss, as appears by the returns made to me since I came 
here, amounts to no more than one hundred and thirty- 
nine killed, thirty-six missing, and two hundred and 
seventy-eight wounded ; nor had we, if I can credit the 
most solemn assurances of the officers, who were in 
the action, above one thousand five hundred men en- 
gaged on that day. The loss on the side of the minis- 
terial troops, as I am informed from good authority, 
consisted of one thousand and forty-three killed and 
wounded, whereof ninety-two were officers.* 

Enclosed I send you a second address from the Con-

declaration setting forth the causes and necessity of 
their taking up arms.

with grass, (although the season has been dry) in a 
manner very different from our lands in Virginia. 

I found a mixed muUitude of people here, under very 
little discipline, order, or government ; the enemy in 
possession of a place called Bunker's Hill, on Charles- 
town Neck, strongly intrenched, and fortifying them- 
selves ; part of our own army on two hills, called 
Winter and Prospect Hills, about a mile and a quarter 
from the enemy on Bunker's Hill, in a very insecure 
state ; another part at this village ; and a third part at 
Roxbury, guarding the entrance in and out of Boston. 
My whole time, since I came here, has been employed 
in throwing up lines of defence at these three several 
places, to secure, in the first instance, our own troops 
from any attempts of the enemy ; and, in the next 
place, to cut off all communication between their troops 
and the country. To do this, and to prevent them from 
penetrating into the country with fire and sword, and to 
harass them if they do, is all that is expected of me. 
If effected, it must totally overthrow the designs of 
administration, as the whole force of Great Britain in 
the town and harbour of Boston can answer no other 
end, than to sink her under the disgrace and weight of 
the expense. The enemy's strength, including marine 
forces, is computed, from the best accounis 1 can get, 
at about twelve thousand men ; ours, including sick 
and absent, at about sixtetni thousand; but then we 
have to guard a semiciicle of eight or nine miles, to 
every part of which we are obliged to be equally atten- 
tive ; whilst they, situated as it were in the centre of 
the semicircle, and having the entire command of the 
water, can bend their whole force against any one part 
of it with equal facility. This renders our situation not 
very agreeable, though necessary. However, by in- 
cessant Jaboi', Sundays nol excepted, wv ai'c in a much

better posture of defence now, than when I first came. 
The enclosed, though i-ough, will give you some small 
idea of Boston and the Bay on this side, as also of the 
post they have taken on Charlestown Neck at Bunker's 
Hill, and of our posts. 

The enemy are sickly, and in want of fresh pro- 
visions. Beef, which is chiefly got by slaughtering their 
milch cows in Boston, sells from one shilling to eighteen 

ttSrv^ tv- pence sterling per pound ;^and that it may not become 

cheaper, or more plenty, I have driven all the stock, 

r^ within a considerable distance of this place, back into 

the country, out of the way of the men-of-war's boats. 

In short, I have done, and shall continue to do, every 

-\' thing in my power to distress them. The transports 

have all arrived, and their whole reinforcement is landed, 
so that I can see no reason why they should not, if they 
ever attempt it, come boldly out, and put the matter to 
issue at once. If they think themselves not strong 
enough to do this, they surely will carry their arms 
(having ships of war and transports ready) to some 
other part of the continent, or relinquish the dispute ; 
the last of which the ministry, unless compelled, will 
never agree to do. Our works, and those of the 
enemy are so near and the space betweea is so open, 
that each sees every thing the other is doing. 

I recollect nothing more worth mentioning. I shall 
therefore conclude, with my best wishes and love to my 
sister and the family, and compliments to any inquiring 
friends, vour most aflfectionate brother.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Camj) at Cambridge, 28 July, 177.5. 

^'R' ?V\CJL, ^/R. LI 

I wrote you }-esterday by way of New York, and in 

two hours afterwards was favored with yours of the 
tSj^MAv.,15th and 18th instant, with their respective enclosures. 
^. 3 & . I was extremely glad to find, that your first apprehen- 
sions of an incursion by the Indians were in some de- 
gree removed by the late advices. At the same time, 
I think it is evident from the spirit and tenor of Colonel 
Johnson's letter, that no art or influence will be left un- 
tried by him to engage them in such an enterprise. 
Should he once prevail upon them to dip their hands in 
blood, mutual hostilities will most probably ensue, and 
they may be led to take a more decisive part. All ac- 
counts I think agree, that the Canadians are very averse 
to engaging in this unnatural contest ; but I am persuaded 
you will not abate in the least your vigilance to expedite 
every movement in that quarter, notwithstanding their 
present pacific appearances.* 

* The Indians began to be restless iii the western parts of New York, 
and there were strong indications that Guy Johnson, the Indian agent, 
was stirring them up against the colonies. Reports came, also, that Gen- 
eral Carleton w.ts fortifying St. John's, building boats, and preparinff to 
make a descent on Lake Champlain, and attack Crown Point and Ticonde- 
roga. This intelligence reached Congress afler Washmgton's departure 
for the camp, and produced a change in the public counsels. It had pre- 
viously been the determination not to make any hostile attempts upon 
Canada, and a resolve of Congress to that effect was passed on the 1st of 
June. Rut after the above intelligence reached Congress from a com- 
mittee in Albany, a set of resolutions was immediately adopted, June '27th, 
bearing a very different complexion, and instructing General Schuyler to 
repair witliout delay to Ticonderoafa, and " if he found it jiracticablo. 
and it would not be disagreeable to the Canadians, immediately to take 
possession of St. John's and Montreal, and pursue any other measures 
in Canada, which might have a tendency to promote the peace and securi- 
ty of these colonies." The resolutions from which this extract is taken 
were not printed in the Journals, but they afford a key to the subsequent 
operations on Lake Champlain. ^ — See Appk.m>i\, No. V.

I am much easier with respect to the public interest 
since your arrival at Ticonderoga, as I am persuaded 
those abilities and that zeal for the common welfare, 
which have led your country to repose such confidence 
in you, will be fully exerted. From my own experi- 
ence I can easily judge of your difficulties in introducing 
order and discipline into troops, who have from their 
infancy imbibed ideas of the most contrary kind. It 
would be far beyond the compass of a letter, for me to 
describe the situation of things here on my arrival. 
Perhaps you will only be able to judge of it from my 
assuring you, that mine must be a portrait at full length 
of what you have had in miniature. Confusion and 
discord reigned in every department, which, in a little 
time, must have ended either in the separation of the 
army, or fatal contests with one another. The better 
genius of America has prevailed, and most happily the 
ministerial troops have not availed themselves of their 
advantages, dll I trust the opportunity is in a great meas- 
ure past over. The arrangement of the general offi- 
cers in Massachusetts and Connecticut has been very 
unpopular, indeed I may say injudicious. It is returned 
to the Congress for further consideration, and has much 
retarded my plan of discipline. However, we mend 
every day, and I flatter myself that in a little lime we 
shall work up these raw materials into a good manufac- 
tui-e. I must recommend to you, what 1 endeavour to 
practise myself, patience and perseverance. As to your 
operations, my dear Sir, I can suggest nothing, which 
your own good judgment will not either anticipate, or 
control, from your immediate view of things, and the 
instructions of the Continental Congress,

count of the commencement of hostilities at Lexington,

half per cent. General Gage's account had not arrived, 
and the enemy affected to treat it as a fiction. Parlia- 
ment had been prorogued two days, but it was reported 
that it would be immediately recalled. Our enemy 
continues strongly posted about a mile from us, both at 
Bunker's Hill and Roxbury, but we are not able to get 
any information of their future intentions. Part of the 
riflemen are come in, and the rest daily expected. 

I did not suppose your returns would be very com- 
plete at first ; but I must ask your attention to reform- 
ing them as soon as possible ; and I beg leave to add, 
that I would have you scrutinize with exactness into 
the application of provisions and stores.* I have the 
utmost reason to suspect irregularities and impositions 
here. You will be fortunate if the contagion does not 
reach you. General Lee has removed about four miles 
from me, but I will take the first opportunity to make 
your kind wishes known to him. t I am, dear Sir,

TO THE SPEAKER OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF 
MASSACHUSETTS BAY.* 

Camp at Cambridge, 31 July, 177.5. 

W<^ , ZT, 7<i*/ Sir, 

I have considered the application made to me yester- 

■ — '- day from the General Court, with all the attention due 

to the situation of the people, in whose behalf it is 

made, and the respect due to such a recommendation. 

* General Gage, as governor of the colony, summoned in the usual way 
a meeting of the General Assembly to be held at Salem, on the 5th of 
October, 1774. After issuing precepts for the election, he was induced by 
the cuiTent of events to suspend the meeting of the members chosen. 
They met, however, to the number of ninety, at the time and place ap- 
pointed ; and receiving no message from the governor, and questioning 
the legality of liis proclamation, they formed themselves into a Provincial 
Congress, and proceeded to take into consideration the affairs of the colo- 
ny. They adjourned to Cambridge, where, except an intermission of 
three or four weeks, by adjournment, they continued in session till the 
10th of December, when the Congress was dissolved, having previously 
recommended a new election to the people, and appointed a Committee of 
Safety from their own members to manage the public concerns, till a new 
Congress should be assembled. The second Congress met on the 1st of 
February, 1775, at Cambridge, but adjourned to Concord, and afterwards 
to Watertown ; it was dissolved on the 23d of May. A third Congress 
met at Watertown, May 31st, and continued till July 19th, when the 
1- i) J' /Ti ShTjiAAi^ government by Provincial Congresses ceased, and the General Assembly, 

i. ^(AAA/^<. W-^ Pj,^ ^g -^ ^j^g Otherwise called. General Court, convened at Watertown. 

/) ■ 3 I ^ This was the body, which Washington now addressed. It differed from the 

' old mode, by having a Council, and thus acting in two separate branches. 

The Provincial Congress, had, on the 16th of May, written to the Con- 
tinental Congress requesting their advice on tlie expediency of establish- 
ing a more efficient system, or, as it was termed, talcing up eivil gorrm- 
vient. In their letter it was stated, — "As the sword should, in all free 
states, bo subservient to the civil powers, and as it is tlie duty of tlie 
magistrate to support it for the people's necessary defence, we tremble at 
liaving an army, although consisting of our own countrymen, established 
here, without a civil power to provide for and control them." In conse- 
quence of this representation, the Continental Congress, on the 9th of 
June, passed a resolve, recommending the adoption of the old form of an 
Assembly, according to the spirit and substance of the charter, as far as 
it could be efl'cctod witliout tlie agency of a governor. A new election 
was immediately ordered, and the Assembly convened as above stated.— 
MS. Jdiirnal of the Massachusetts Congress, for May and June. 



PaktII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 45 

Upon referring to my instructions, and consulting with 
those members of Congress, who arc present, as well 
as the general othcers, they all agree, that it would not 
be consistent with my duty to detach any part of the 
army now here on any particular provincial service. It 
has been debated in Congress and settled, that the mili- 
tia, or other internal strength of each province, is to be 
applied for defence against those small- and particular 
depredations, which were to be expected, and to which 
they were supposed to be competent. This will appear 
the more proper, when it is considered, that every tov\'n 
and indeed every part of our sea-coast, which is ex- 
posed to these depredations, would have an equal claim 
upon this army. 

It is the misfortune of our situation, which exposes 
us to these ravages, and against which, in my judgment, 
no such temporary relief could possibly secure us. The 
great advantage the enemy have of transporting troops, 
by being masters of the sea, will enable them to harass 
us by diversions of this kind ; and should we be tempt- 
ed to pursue them upon every alarm, the army must 
either be so weakened as to expose it to destruction, or 
a great part of the coast be still left unprotected. Nor, 
indeed, does it appear to me, that such a pursuit would 
be attended with the least effect. The first notice of 
such an excursion would be its actual execution ; and 
long before any troops could reach the scene of action, 
the enemy would have an opportunity to accomplish 
their puipose and retire. It would give me great 
pleasure to have it in my power to extend protection 
and safety to every individual ; but the wisdom of the 
General Court will anticipate me in the necessity of 
conducting our operations on a general and impartial 
scale, so as to exclude any just cause of complaint and 
jealousy.

I beg, Sir, you will do me the honor to communi- 
cate these sentiments to the General Court, and to 
apologize lor my involuntary delay, as we were alarmed 
this morning by the enemy, and my time was taken 
up in giving the necessary directions. 

I shall be happy in every opportunity of showing my 
very great respect and regard for the General Court of 
Massachusetts Bay, and am, Sir, &lc.

I am favored with yours of the 31st of July, informing

,,, expedition.* As the enemy has lain much longer inac- 

' tive than I expected, I hope they will arrive in tmie to

My last letter from the honorable Continental Con- 
gress recommends my procuring, from the colonies of 
Rhode Island and Connecticut, a quantity of tow cloth, 
for the purpose of making Indian or hunting- shirts for 
the men, many of whom are destitute of clothing. A 
pattern is herewith sent you ; and I must request you 
to give the necessary directions throughout your govern- 
ment, that all the cloth of this kind may be bought up 
for this use, and suitable persons set to work to make it 
up. As soon as any number is made, worth the con- 
veyance, you will please to direct them to be forwarded. 
It is designed as a species of uniform, both cheap and 
convenient.

under the necessity of going that way. I am, Sir, &.c.

the subject, which could give the smallest hope. 

Among others, I have had one mentioned, which has 

some weight with me, as well as the general officers to 

whom I have proposed it. A Mr. Harris has lately 

come from Bermuda, where there is a very considerable 

magazine of powder in a remote part of the island ; and 

the inhabitants are well disposed not only to our cause 

in general, but to assist in tliis enterprise in particular. 

We understand there are two armed vessels in your 

province, commanded by men of knov.n activity and

spirit ; one of which, it is proposed to despatch on this 
errand with such assistance as may be requisite. Harris 
is to go along, as the conductor of the enterprise, that 
we may avail ourselves of his knowledge of the island ; 
but without any command. I am very sensible, that at 
first view the project may appear hazardous ; and its 
success must depend on the concurrence of many cir- 
cumstances ; but we are in a situation, which requires 
us to run all risks. No danger is to be considered, 
when put in competition with the magnitude of the 
cause, and the absolute necessity we are under of in- 
creasing our stock. Enterprises, which appear chimeri- 
cal, often prove successful from that very circumstance. 
Common sense and prudence will suggest vigilance and 
care, where the danger is plain and obvious ; but, where 
litde danger is apprehended, the more the enemy will 
be unprepared, and consequently there is the fairest 
prospect of success. 
, ' „ / « ' Mr. Brown has been mentioned to me as a very 

proper person to be consulted upon this occasion, r ou 
will judge of the propriety of communicating it to 'him 
in part or the whole, and as soon as possible favor me 
with your sentiments, and the steps you may have taken 
to forward it. If no immediate and safe opportunity offers, 
you will please to do it by express. Should it be in- 
convenient to part with one of the armed vessels, per- 
haps some other might be fitted out, or you could de- 
vise some other mode of executing this plan ; so that, in 
case of a disappointment, the vessel might proceed to 
some other island to purchase. 

We have had no transactions in either camp since 
my last, but what are in the ptiblic papers, and related 
with tolerable accuracy. The enemy still continue to 
strengthen their fines, and, we have reason to beUeve, 
intend to bombard ours, with the hope of forcing us out

of them. Our poverty in ammunition prevents our 
making a suitable return.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp at Cambridge, 4 August, 1775. 

Sir, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of 
the 24th of July, accompanied by two hundred and 
eighty-four commissions, which ai'e yet much short 
of the necessary number. I am much honored by the 
confidence reposed in me, of appointing the several 
officers recommended in mine of the 10th ultimo; and 
shall endeavour to select such persons as are best 
qualified to fill these important posts. 

General Thomas has accepted his commission, and I / C^^<u.H ^^'-'^//o 
have heard nothing of his retirement since, so that I 
hope that he is satisfied. 

In the renewal of these commissions some difficulties 
occur, in which I should be glad to know the pleasure 
of the honorable Congress. The general officers of 
the Massachusetts have regiments ; those of Connecticut 
have both regiments and companies ; and the other field- 
officers have companies each. In New Hampshire, the 
general officers have no regiments ; nor the field-officers 
companies. In Rhode Island, the general officers have 
no regiments, but the field-officers have companies ; 
though I do not find that they have or expect pay under 
more than one commission. Should the commissions, 
now to be delivered, pursue these different establish- 

VOL. III. 7 E 



50 WASHINGTOiN'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 43. 

rnents, there will be a distinction between the general 
and field officers of the same rank. In order to put 
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island 
upon a line with Connecticut, it would be necessary to 
dismiss a number of officers in possession of commis- 
sions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, 
to bring the Connecticut general and field officers to the 
same scale with the others, will add to the number of 
officers, and may be deemed inconsistent with the terms 
on which they entered into the service, although you 
add nothing to the expense, except in the article of 
provisions. Upon the whole, it is a case which I would 
wish the honorable Congress to consider and detennine. 
UrxAXoi'Vi /B-i/>M*, Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head 
IJ7 8;i_ of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the 

Provincial Congress. Will it be proper to renew his 
commission here in the same manner? It is proper 
here to remark, that, in this case, he will take rank of 
all the brigadier-generals, and even the major-generals 
whose commissions are subsequent in date ; and this 
can answer no good pui-pose, but may be productive of 
many bad consequences. 

These are matters of some importance ; but I am 
embarrassed with a difficulty of a superior nature. The 
estimate, made in Congress, supposed all the regiments 
to be formed upon one establishment ; but they are 
different in different provinces, and even vary in ihe 
same province, in some particulars. In Massachusetts, 
some regiments have ten companies, others eleven ; the 
establishment of the former is five hundred and ninety 
men, officers included ; of the latter, six hundred and 
forty-nine. The establishment of Rhode Island and 
New Hampshire is five hundred and ninety to a 
regiment, officers included ; Connecticut has a thou- 
sand men to a regiment. Should these regiments 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 51 

be completed, with the new levies from Rhode Island 
and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the number will 
exceed twenty-two thousand. If they should not be 
completed, as each regiment is fully ofl'icered, there will 
be a heavy expense to the public without any ade- 
quate service. The reduction of some of them seems 
to be necessary, and yet is a matter of much delicacy, 
as we are situated. I most earnestly request it may be 
taken into immediate consideration, and the time and 
mode of doing it pointed out by the honorable Con- 
gress. By an estimate I have made from the general 
return, when the new levies arrive, and the regiments 
are completed, there will be twenty-four thousand five 
hundred and fifty men on the pay and provision of the 
United Colonies. Some of the recruiting-officers, who 
have been out on that service, have returned with very 
litde success ; so that we may safely conclude, the number 
of two thousand and sixty -four, now wanting to complete 
them, will rather increase than diminish. There are 
the regiment of artillery, consisdng of four hundred and 
ninety-three men, and one under Colonel Sergeant (who 
has not received any commission, although he had or- 
ders to raise a regiment, from the Provincial Congress 
here), which are not included in the above estimate. 
This last regiment consists of two hundred and thirty- 
four men by the last return ; but a company has since 
joined.* 

* Symptoms of fear, concerning the influence of a military power, be- 
gan to appear in Congress very soon after the appointment of the Com- 
mander-in-chief It was resolved, on the 21st of July, " That such a body 
of troops be kept up in the Massachusetts Bay, as General Washington 
shall think necessary, provided the;/ do not exceed twenty-two thousand men." 
There was a slender probability, perhaps, that the forces would soon go 
beyond this number, and indeed it had been decided by a council of war, 
that in the present state of things no more were necessary ; but it was an 
excess of caution, and very dubious policy, to say the least, thus to limit 



52 \VASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mi: 43. 

In adverting to the general return, which I have the 
honor of enclosing, it will be seen, what regiments are 
most deficient. 

If the Congress does not choose to point out the 
particular regiments, but the provinces in which the re- 
duction is to be made, the several Congresses and As- 
semblies may be the proper channel to conduct this 
business, which I should also conceive the most advisa- 
ble, from their better acquaintance with the merits, 
terms, and time of service, of the respective officers. 
Reducing some regiments, and with the privates thereof 
filling up others, would certainly be the best method of 
accomplishing this work if it were pracdcable ; but the 
experiment is dangerous, as the Massachusetts men, 
under the privilege of choosing their own officers, do 
not conceive themselves bound, if those officers are 
disbanded. 

As General Gage is making preparations for winter 
by contracting for quantities of coal, it will suggest to 
us the propriety of extending our views to that season. 
I have directed, that such huts as have been lately made 
of boards should be done in such a manner, that, if 
necessary, they may serve for covering during the win- 

the number of forces for defence, when no foresiglit could determine tlie 
strength of the enemy at any future moment. This resolve was the be- 
ginning of a series of acts in Congress bearing a similar complexion, 
which ultimately caused much anxiety to the Commander-in-chief, fo- 
mented party dissensions within the walls of Congress, encouraged in- 
trigue in the army, and retarded the successful progress of the war. It is 
remarkable, that the president of Congress, in conmiunicating the above 
resolve to General Washington, should say it was passed in consequence 
of the " confidence reposed in liis prudence." From the tenor of the re- 
solve itself, a contrary reason would seem rather to have been tlie true 
one. It is probable, however, that it had its origin in the timid apprehen- 
sions of some of the members, whose historical recollections inspired them 
with no favorable hopes from an overgrown military establisment, even 
under the watchful control of the roprcaentativea of the people. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 53 

ten But I need not enlarge upon the variety of ne- 
cessities, such as clothing and fuel (both exceedingly 
scarce, and difficult to be procured), which that season 
must bring with it, if the army or any considerable part 
of it is to remain embodied. 

From the inactivity of the enemy, since the arrival of 
their whole reinforcement, their continual addition to 
their lines, and many other circumstances, I am inclined 
to think, that, finding us so well prepared to receive 
them, the plan of operations is varied, and they mean, 
by regular approaches, to bombard us out of our present 
Une of defence, or are waiting in expectation, that the 
colonies must sink under the weight of the expense, or 
the prospect of a winter campaign so discourage our 
troops, as to break up our army. If they have not some 
such expectations, the issue of which they are deter- 
mined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when 
their strength is lessened every day by sickness, deser- 
tions, and little skirmishes. 

Since I had the honor of addressing you last, I have 
been applied to by a committee of the General Court, 
for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants 
of the eastern parts of this province from some appre- 
hended depredations on their coasts. I could have 
wished to comply with their request ; but after due con- 
sideration, and consulting the general officers, together 
with those members of Congress who are here, I 
thought it my duty to excuse myself. The application 
and my answer are enclosed, which I hope will be ap- 
proved by the honorable Congress. 

Since I began this letter, the original, of which the 
enclosed is a copy, fell into my hands. As the writer 
is a person of some note in Boston, and it contams some 
advices of importance not mentioned by others, I 
thought proper to forward it as I received it. By com- 



54 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

paring it with the handwriting of another letter, it ap- 
pears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a person proba- 
bly known to some of the gentlemen, delegates from 
this province, who can determine from his principles 
and character what credit is due to him. 

The army is now formed into three grand divisions, 
under the command of the Generals Ward, Lee, and 
Putnam ; each division into two brigades, consisting of 
about six regiments each, commanded by Generals 
Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury ; Heath at Cambridge ; 
Sullivan and Greene at Winter Hill, By this, you will 
please to observe, there is a deficiency of one brigadier- 
general, occasioned by Mr. Pomroy's refusal to accept 
his commission, which I beg may be filled up as soon as 
possible. I observe the honorable Congress have also 
favored me with the appointment of three brigade- 
majors. I presume they have appointed, or intend to ap- 
point, the rest soon, as they cannot be unacquainted that 
one is necessary to each brigade ; and, in a new-raised 
army, it will be an ofiice of great duty and service. 

General Gage has at length liberated the people of 
Boston, who land in numbers at Chelsea every day. 
The terms on which the passes are granted, as to 
money, effects, and provisions, correspond with Mr. 
Noyes's letter. 

We have several reports that General Gage is dis- 
mantling Casde Wilham, and bringing all the cannon up 
to town ; but, upon a very particular inquiry, accounts 
are so various, that I cannot ascertain the truth of it. 

On the first instant, a chief of the Caghnawaga tribe, 
who lives about six miles from Montreal, came in here, 
Th/\^<A^i '■f/t accompanied by a Colonel Bayley of Coos. His ac- 
ir j-ii/f) counts of the temper and disposition of the Indians are 
very favorable. He says they have been strongly so- 
licited by Governor Carleton to engage against us, but 



Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 55 

his nation is totally averse ; that threats, as well as en- 
treaties, have been used without effect ; that the Cana- 
dians are well-disposed to the English colonies ; and, if 
any expedition is meditated against Canada, the Indians 
in that quarter will give all their assistance. I have en- 
deavoured to cherish these favorable disposidons, and 
have recommended to him to cultivate them on his re- 
turn. What I have said, I enforced with a present, 
which I understood would be agreeable to him ; and as 
he is represented to be a man of weight and conse- 
quence in his own tribe, I flatter myself his visit will 
have a good effect. His accounts of General Carleton's 
force and situation at St. John's correspond with what _ ^ **" 

we have already had from that quarter. '- ^ ^ 

The accession of Georgia to the measures of the 
Congress is a happy event, and must give sincere plea- 
sure to every friend of America. I am, &c.

CHUSETTS BAY. 

Head-Quarters, 7 August, 1775. 

Sir, 

By the general return made to me for last week, I 
find there are great numbers of soldiers and non-com- 
missioned officers, who absent themselves from duty, 
the greater part of whom, I have reason to beheve, are 
at their respective homes in different parts of the coun- 
try ; some employed by their officers on their farms, 
and others drawing pay from the public, while they are 
working on their own plantations or for hire. My ut- 
most exertions have not been able to prevent this base 
and pernicious conduct. I must, therefore, beg the as- 
sistance of the General Court to cooperate with me in 



..'i/S 



66 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

such measures, as may remedy this mischief. I am of 
opinion it might be done, either wholly or in part, by the 
committees in your several towns making strict and im- 
partial inquiry of such as are found absent from the 
army, upon whose account they have left it, by whose 
leave, and for what time ; requiring such, as have no im- 
pediment of sickness or other good reason, to return to 
their duty immediately, or, in case of failure sending an 
account of their names, and the company and regiment 
to which they belong, that I may be able to make ex- 
amples of such delinquents. 

I need not enlarge upon the ruinous consequences of 
suffering such infamous deserters and defrauders of the 
public to go unnoticed or unpunished, nor use any argu- 
ments to induce the General Court to give it immediate 
attention. The necessity of the case does not permit 
me to doubt the continued exertions of that zeal, which 
has distinguished the General Court upon less important 
occasions. I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF NEW YORK. 

Camp at Cambridge, 8 August, 1775. 

Gentlemen, 
It must give great concern to any considerate mind, 
that, when this whole continent, at a vast expense of 
blood and treasure, is endeavouring to establish its liber- 
ties on the most secure and solid foundations, not only 
by a laudable opposidon of force to force, but denying 
itself the usual advantages of trade, there are men 
among us so basely sordid, as to counteract all our ex- 
ertions, for the sake of a little gain. You cannot but 
have heard, that the distresses of the ministerial troops

57 



for fresh provisions and many other necessaries at Bos- 
ton were very great. It is a policy, justifiable by all 
the laws of war, to endeavour to increase them. Deser- 
tions, discouragement, and a dissatisfaction with the ser- 
vice, besides weakening their strength, ai'e some of the 
natural consequences of such a situation ; and, if con- 
tinued, might afford the fairest hope of success, without 
further eilusion of human blood. 

A vessel, cleared lately out of New York for St. Croix, 
with fresh provisions and other articles, has just gone 
into Boston, instead of pursuing her voyage to the West 
Indies. I have endeavoured to discover the name of 
the captain, or owner, but as yet without success. The 
owner it is said, went to St. Croix before the vessel ; 
from which, and her late arrival, I make no doubt you 
will be able to discover and expose the villain. And, if 
you could fall upon some effectual measures, to prevent 
the Uke in future, it would be doing a signal service to 
our common country. 

I have been endeavouring, by every means in my 
power, to discover the future intentions of our enemy 
here. I find a general idea prevailing, throughout the 
army and in the town of Boston, that the troops are 
soon to leave the town and go to some other part of the 
continent. New York is generally mentioned, as the 
place of their destination. I should think a rumor or 
suggestion of this kind worthy of very little notice, if it 
were not confirmed by some corresponding circumstan- 
ces. But four weeks of total inactivity, with all their re- 
inforcements arrived and recruited, the daily diminution 
by desertions, sickness, and small skirmishes, induce an 
opinion, that any effort they propose to make will be 
directed elsewhere. 

I thought it proper just to hint to you what is proba- 
bly intended, and you will then consider what regard is

to be paid to it, and what steps it will be expedient for 
you to take, if any. I am, with great respect and re- 
gard. Gentlemen, &,c. 



TO A COMMITTEE OF THE GENERAL COURT OF 
MASSACHUSETTS BAY. 



Camp at Cambridge, 11 August, 1775. 

Gentlemen, 
I have considered the papers you left with me yes- 
,— . terday. 
'^CjL tr^^ ' ^- As to the expedidon proposed against Nova Scotia, 

by the inhabitants of Machias, I cannot but applaud 
their spirit and zeal ; but, after considering the reasons 
offered for it, several objections occur, which seem to 
me unanswerable. I apprehend such an enterprise to 
be inconsistent with the general principle upon which 
the colonies have proceeded. That province has not 
acceded, it is true, to the measures of Congress ; and, 
therefore, it has been excluded from all commercial in- 
tercourse with the other colonies ; but it has not com- 
menced hostilities against them, nor are any to be appre- 
hended. To attack it, therefore, is a measure of con- 
quest, rather than defence, and may be attended with 
very dangerous consequences. It might, perhaps, be 
easy, with the force proposed to make an incursion, into 
the province and overawe those of the inhabitants, who 
are inimical to our cause, and, for a short time, prevent 
their supplying the enemy with provisions ; but, to pro- 
duce any lasting effects, the same force must continue. 
As to the furnishing vessels of force, you. Gentlemen, 
will anticipate me, in poindng out our weakness and the 
enemy's strength at sea. There would be great dan- 
ger, that, with the best preparations we could make, 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 59 

they would fall an easy prey, either to the men-of-war 
on that station, or to some which would be detached 
from Boston. I have been thus particular, to satisfy any 
gentlemen of the Court, who should incline to adopt the 
measure. I could offer many other reasons against it, 
some of which, I doubt not, will suggest themselves to 
the honorable Board. But it is unnecessary to enumerate 
them, when our situation as to ammunition absolutely 
forbids our sending a single ounce of it out of the camp 
at present. I am, Gentlemen, &c.

TO LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GAGE. 

Head-Quarters, Cambridge, II August, 1775. 

Sir, 

I understand that the officers engaged in the cause 
of liberty and their country, who by the fortune of war ^^ 7. t^\^ o'j^ 
have fallen into your hands, have been thrown, indis- 
criminately, into a common gaol appropriated for felons ; 
that no consideration has been had for those of the most 
respectable rank, when languishing with wounds and ^' r //'' -= 

sickness ; and that some have been even amputated in -<- / - 
this unworthy situation. 

Let your opinion. Sir, of the principle which actuates 
them be what it may, they suppose that they act from 
the noblest of all principles, a love of freedom and their 
country. But political principles, I conceive, are foreign 
to this point. The obligations arising from the rights of 
humanity and claims of rank are universally binding and 
extensive, except in case of retahation. These, I should 
have hoped, would have dictated a more tender treat- 
ment of those individuals, whom chance or war had put 
in your power. Nor can I forbear suggesting its fatal 
tendency to widen that unhappy breach, which you, and 



60 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

those ministers under whom you act, have repeatedly 
declared your wish is to see for ever closed. 

My duty now makes it necessary to apprize you, that, 
for the future, I shall regulate all my conduct towards 
those gentlemen, who are or may be in our possession, 
exactly by the rule you shall observe towards those of 
ours now in your custody. 

If severity and hardship mark the line of your con- 
duct, painful as it may be to me, your prisoners will feel 
its effects. But if kindness and humanity are shown 
to ours, I shall with pleasure consider those in our hands 
only as unfortunate, and they shall receive from me that 
treatment to which the unfortunate are ever entitled. 

I beg to be favored with an answer as soon as possi- 
ble, and am. Sir, your very humble servant.*

I am glad to relieve you from your anxiety, respecting 
troops being sent from Boston to Quebec. These re- 
ports, I apprehend, took their rise from a fleet being 
fitted out about fourteen days ago to plunder the islands 
in the Sound of their live stock ; an expedition, which 
they have executed with some success, and are just re- 
turning ; but you may depend on it no troops have been 
detached from Boston for Canada or elsewhere. 

Among other wants, of which I find you have your 
proportion, we feel that of lead most sensibly ; and as we5V. ttrc^^

have concluded to draw upon the stock found at Ticonde-

is considerable, and that a part of it may be spared, 
without exposing you to any inconvenience. In con- 
sequence of this I have written to Governor Trumbull 
to take the direction of the transportation of it, suppos- 
ing the conveyance through Connecticut the most safe 
and expeditious. I expect he will write you on this 
subject by this opportunity.

that the supplies ordered have been so much delayed. 
By this time I hope Colonel M<=Dougall, whose zeal is

Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages.f 

* The Continental Congress adjourned on the 1st of August till the 
5th of September. In the mean time, several of the delegates visited the 
camp, particularly those from the eastern colonies. 

t In a letter of the (jth of August, General Schuyler complains of tlie 
tardiness of the New York Provincial Congress in raising men. He 
says; — "Not a man from this colony has yet joined me, except those^ 
raised and paid by tlie Committee of Albany ; nor have I yet received the 
necessary supplies, which I begged the New York Provincial Congress to 
send me, as long ago as the 3d of last month, and which the Continen-

to aid in holding tliat post. Two hundred and five men of this descrip-

In my last, a copy of which is enclosed, I sent you 
an account of the arrival of several St. Francis Indians 
in our camp, and their friendly dispositions. You have 
also a copy of the resolution of Congress, by which you 
wall find it is their intention to seek only a neutrality of 
the Indian nations, unless the ministerial agents should 
engage them in hostilities, or enter into an offensive alli- 
ance with them. I have been, therefore, embarrassed 
in giving them an answer, when they have tendered 
their services and assistance. As your situation enables 
you best to know the motions of the Governor* and the 
agents, I proposed to the chief to go home by way of 
Ticonderoga, referring him to you for an answer, which 
you will give according to the intelligence you have had, 
and the judgment you have formed of the transactions 
among the Indians ; but as he does not seem in any 
hurry to leave our camp, your answer by the return of 
this express may possibly reach me, before he re- 
turns, and alter his route. Four of his company sdll 
remain in our camp, and propose to stay some time 
with us. 

The design of this express is to communicate to you 
a plan of an expedition, which has engaged my thoughts 
for several days. It is to penetrate into Canada, by 
way of Kennebec River, and so to Quebec by a route 
ninety miles below Montreal. I can very well spare a 
detachment for this purpose of one thousand, or twelve 
hundred men, and the land-carriage by the route pro- 
posed is too inconsiderable to make an objection. If 

cut had sent a thousand troops under Colonel Hmman, who succeeded 
Etlian Allen and Arnold in the command, which lie retained till tlie arrival 
of General Schuyler. By a mutual stipulation, Connecticut was to fur- 
nisli troops, and New York provisions. — See Life of Gouverneur Morris,

you are resolved to proceed, which I gather from your 
last letter is your intention, it would make a diversion, 
that would distract Carleton, and facilitate your views. 
He must either break up and follow this party to Que- 
bec, by which he will leave you a free passage, or he 
must suffer that important place to fall into our hands ; 
an event that would have a decisive effect and influence 
on the public interests. There may be some danger, 
that such a sudden incursion might alarm the Canadians, 



_ n^^^-i- arid detach them from that neutrality which they have 
. ' ' hitherto observed ; but I should hope, that, with suitable 

. precautions, and a strict discipline, any apprehensions 

and jealousies might be removed. The few, whom I 
have consulted upon it, approve it much ; but the final 
determination is deferred until I hear from you. You 
will, therefore, by the return of this messenger, inform 
me of your ultimate resolution. If you mean to pro- 
ceed, acquaint me as particularly as you can with the 
time and force, what late accounts you have had from 
Canada, and your opinion as to the sentiments of the in- 
habitants, as well as those of the Indians upon a pene- 
tration into their country ; what number of troops are 
at Quebec, and whether any men-of-war ; with all other 
circumstances, which may be material in the considera- 
tion of a step of such importance. Not a moment's 
time is to be lost in the preparations for this enterprise, 
if the advices received from you favor it. With the 
utmost expedition, the season will be considerably ad- 
vanced, so that you will dismiss the express as soon as 
possible. 

While the three New Hampshire companies remain 
in their present station, they will not be considered as 
composing a part of the Continental army, but as a 
militia under the direction and pay of the colony, whose

of tyranny has forced into arms to defend their wives, 
their children, and their property, or the mercenary in- 
struments of lawless domination, avarice, and revenge, 
best deserve the appellation of rebels, and the punish- 
ment of that cord, which your affected clemency has 
forborne to inflict ; whether the authority under which I 
act is usurped, or founded upon the genuine principles 
of liberty, were altogether foreign to the subject. I 
purposely avoided all political disquisition ; nor shall I 
now avail myself of those advantages, which the sacred 
cause of my country, of liberty, and of human nature, 
give me over you ; much less shall I stoop to retort and 
invective ; but the intelligence you say you have receiv- 
ed from our army requires a reply. I have taken time, 
Sir, to make a strict inquiry, and find it has not the least 
foundation in truth. Not only your officers and soldiers 
have been treated with the tenderness due to fellow citi- 
zens and brethren, but even those execrable parricides, 
whose counsels and aid have deluged their country with 
blood, have been protected from the fury of a justly en- 
raged people. Far from compelling or permitting their 
assistance, I am embarrassed with the numbers, Avho 
crowd to our camp, animated with the purest principles 
of virtue and love to their country. 

You advise me to give free operation to truth, and to 
punish misrepresentation and falsehood. If experience 
stamps value upon counsel, yours must have a weight, 
which few can claim. You best can tell how far the 
convulsion, which has brought such ruin on both coun- 
tries, and shaken the mighty empire of Britain to its 
foundation, may be traced to these malignant causes. 

You affect. Sir, to despise all rank not derived from 
the same source with your own. I cannot conceive 
one more honorable, than that which flows from the un- 
corrupted choice of a brave and free people, the purest

source and original tbiuitain of all power. Far from 
making it a plea for cruelty, a mind of true magnanimity 
and enlarged ideas would comprehend and respect it. 

What may have been the ministerial views, which 
have precipitated the present crisis, Lexington, Con- 
cord, and Charlestown can best declare. May that 
God, to whom you then appeal, judge between Ameri- 
ca and you. Under his providence, those who influ- 
ence the counsels of America, and all the other inhabi- 
tants of the United Colonies, at the hazard of their lives, 
are determined to hand down to posterity those just 
and invaluable privileges, which they received from their 
ancestors. 

I shall now. Sir, close my correspondence with you, 
perhaps for ever. If your officers, our prisoners, re- 
ceive a treatment from me difl'erent from that, which I 
wished to show them, they and you will remember the 
occasion of it. I am Sir, your very humble servant.*

approve and condemn. 

I have not the least objection to put a stop to the

TO RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Camp at Cambridge, 29 August, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 1st instant, by Mr. Randolph, came 

safe to hand. The merits of this young gentleman, 

added to your recommendation, and my own knowledge 

of his character, induced me to take him into my family, 

as an aid-de-camp, in the room of Mr. Mifflin, whom I 

have appointed quartermaster-general, from a thorough 

U^ /Vxc(. persuasion of his integrity, my own experience of his 

. J activity, and, finally, because he stands unconnected 

with either of these governments, or with this, that, or 

the other man ; for, between you and me, there is more 

in this than you can easily imagine. 

I submit it, therefore, to your consideration, whether 
there is, or is not, a propriety in that resolution of the 
Congress, which leaves the ultimate appointment of all 
officers below the rank of generals, to the governments 
where the regiments originated, now the army is become

request all further intercourse between the two camps may be at an end

Continental. To me it appears improper, iu two points 
oi" view ; first, it is giving that power and weight to an 
individual colony, which ought, of right, to belong only 
to the whole ; and next, it damps the spirit and ardor 
of volunteers from all but the four New England 
governments, as none but their people have the least 
chance of getting into office. Would it not be better, 
therefore, to have the warrants, which the Commander- 
in-chief is authorized to give pro tempore, approved or 
disapproved by the Continental Congress, or a committee 
of their body, which I should suppose, in any long 
recess, must always sit. In this case every gentleman 
will stand an equal chance of being promoted, according 
to his merit ; in the other, all offices will be confined to 
the inhabitants of the four New England governments, 
which, in my opinion, is impolitic to a great degree. 

I have not been unmindful of that part of your letter 
respecting Point Alderton ; before the receipt of it, it 
had become an object of my particular inquiry, but the 
accounts of its situation differ exceedingly, in respect to 
the command it has of the ship-channel. But my 
knowledge of this matter would not have been confined 
to inquiries only, if I had ever been in a condition, 
since my arrival here, to take possession of such a 
post ; but you well know, my good Sir, that it becomes 
the duty of an officer to consider some other matters, 
as well as a situation, namely, what number of men 
are necessary to defend a place, how it can be support- 
ed, and how furnished with ammunition. In respect 
to the first, I conceive our defence of this place (Point 
Alderton) must be proportioned to the attack of Gene- 
ral Gage's whole force, leaving him just enough to man 
his lines on Boston and Charlestown Necks ; and with 
regard to the second, and most important, as well as 
alarming object, we have only one hundred and eighty-

day. Under these circumstances, I dare say you w^ill 
agree with me, that it would not be very eligible to take 
a post thirty miles distant, by land, from this place, 
when Ave have already a line of circumvallation round 
Boston, of at least ten miles in extent, to defend, any 
part of which may be attacked, without our having (if 
the enemy will keep their own counsel) an hour's pre- 
vious notice of it ; and that it would not be prudent in 
me to attempt a measure, which would necessarily bring 
on a consumption of all the ammunition we have, there- 
by leaving the army at the mercy of the enemy, or to 
disperse, and the country to be ravaged and laid waste 
at discretion. To you. Sir, I may account for my con- 
duct ; but I cannot declare the motives of it to every 
one, notwithstanding I know, by not doing it, that I shall 
stand in a very unfavorable light in the opinion of those, 
who expect much, and will find litde done, without 
understanding, or, perhaps, giving themselves the trou- 
ble of inquiring into the cause. Such, however, is the 
fate of all those, who are obliged to act the part I do ; I 
must, therefore, submit to it, under a consciousness of 
having done my duty to the best of my abilities.*

On Saturday night last, we took possession of a hill 
in advance of our lines, and within point-blank shot of 
the enemy on Charlestown Neck. We worked inces- 
santly the whole night one thousand two hundred men, 
and, before morning, got an intrenchment in such 
forwardness, as to bid defiance to their cannon. About 
nine o'clock, on Sunday, they began a heavy cannon- 
ade, which continued through the day, without any in- 
jury to our work, and with the loss of four men only ; 
two of whom were killed through their own folly. To 
the insult of the cannonade, however, we were obliged 
to submit with impunity, not daring to make use of 
artillery on account of the consumption of powder, 
except one nine pounder, placed on a point, with 
w^hich we silenced, and indeed sunk one of their float- 
ing batteries. This move of ours was made to prevent 
the enemy from gaining this hill, and we thought was 
giving them a fair challenge to dispute it, as we had 
been told by various people, who had just left Boston, 
that they were preparing to come out ; but, instead of 
accepting it, we learn that it has thrown them into 
the greatest consternation, which might be improved, if 
we had the means of doing it. Yesterday afternoon 
they began a bombardment, without any effect as yet. 
As I expect this letter will meet you in Philadelphia, I 



reason and experience join in proving, tliat, witiiout discipline, armies are 
fit only for the contempt and slaughter of their enemies. Your labors are 
no doubt great, both of mind and body ; but if the praise of the present 
and future times can be any compensation, you will have a plentiful por- 
tion of that. Of one thing you may certainly rest assured, that the Con- 
gress will do every thing in their power to make your most weighty busi- 
ness easy to you.

* As the filling up the vacant place of brigadier-gene- 
^^ h ' ral will probably be of the first business of the honora- 

ble Congress, I flatter myself it will not be deemed 
assuming, to mention the names of two gentlemen, 
whose foiTner services, rank, and age, may be thought 
worthy of attention on this occasion. Of the one I can 
speak from my own knowledge, of the other only from 
character. The former is Colonel John Armstrong, of 
Pennsylvania ; he served during the last war, in most 
of the campaigns to the southward, was honored with 
the command of the Pennsylvania forces, and his gene- 
ral military conduct and spirit much approved by all 
who served with him ; besides which, his character was 
distinguished by an enterprise against the Indians, which 
he planned with great judgment, and executed with 
equal courage and success.* It was not till lately that 
I had reason to believe he would enter again on public 
service ; and it is now wholly unsolicited and unknown

good conduct on this occasion. An intimacy of many years' standing 
subsisted between him and Washington.

on his part. The other gentleman is Colonel Frye of 
Massachusetts Bay. He entered into the service as 
early as 1745, and rose through the diflerent military 
ranks, in the succeeding wars, to that of colonel, until 
last June, when he was appointed a major-general by 
the Congress of this province.* From these circum- 
stances, together with the favorable report made to me 
of him, I presume he sustained the character of a good 
officer, though I do not find it distinguished by any pe- 
culiar service. 

Either of these gendemen, or any other whom the 
honorable Congress shall please to favor with this ap- 
pointment, will be received by me with the utmost 
deference and respect. 

Last Saturday night we took possession of a hill 
considerably advanced beyond our former lines ; which 
brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's Hill, 
and afterwards a bombardment, which has been since 
kept up with little spirit on their part, or damage on 
ours. The work, having been continued ever since, is 
now so advanced, and the men so well covered, as to 
leave us under no apprehensions of much farther loss. 
In this affair we had killed one adjutant, one volunteer, 
and two privates. The scarcity of ammunition does 
not admit of our availing ourselves of the situation, as 
we otherwise might do ; but this evil, I hope, will soon 
be remedied, as I have been informed of the arrival of 
a large quantity at New York, of some at New London, 
and of more expected hourly at different places. I need 
not add to what I have already said on this subject.

Camp at Cambridge, 2 September, 1775. 

Sir, 

By the time you receive this letter, you will be able 
to judge with some certainty whether the fleet, which 
sailed last from Boston, was destined for your coast. If 
it has not yet arrived, we may conclude it has sailed to 
the eastward ; if it has arrived, the issue Avill be known 
immediately ; so that in either case the continuance of 
the new raised levies along the coast is unnecessary. 
You will, therefore, on receipt of this be pleased to 
order them to march immediately to this camp, direct- 
ing the commanding officer, at the same time, to give me 
two or three days' notice of the time, in which the troops 
will arrive, that suitable accommodations may be pre- 
pared. Their presence is the more necessary, as I 
may in confidence inform you, that I am about to 
detach one thousand or twelve hundred men on an 
expedition into Canada, by way of Kennebec River; 
from which I have the greatest reason to expect, either 
that Quebec will fall into our hands a very easy prey, 
or such a diversion be made as will open an easy pas- 
sage to General Schuyler. 

We are now so well secured in our late advanced post 
on the hill, that the enemy have discontinued their can- 
nonade. The men continue in good health and spirits. 
I am, with much regard and esteem, &c.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL WOOSTER.* 

Camp at Cambridge, 2 September, 1775. 

Sir, 
I have just received your favor of the 29th uhimo by 
express. I am very sensible, that the situation of the 
inhabitants of Long Island, as well as of all those on 
the coast, exposes them greatly to the ravages of the 
enemy, and it is to be Avished that general protection 
could be extended to them, consistent with the prose- 
cution of those great plans, which have been adopted for 
the common safety. This was early foreseen, and the 
danger provided for by a resolution of Congress, that 
each province should depend on its own internal 
strength against these incursions, the prejudice arising 
from them, even if successful, not being equal to that 
of separating the army into a number of small detach- 
ments, which would be harassed in fruiUess marches 
and countermarches after an enemy, whose conveyance 
by shipping is so advantageous, that they might keep 
the whole coast in constant alarm, without our being 
able, perhaps, at any time to give them vigorous oppo- 
sition. Upon this principle I have invariably rejected

quest of the New York Provincial Congress, with four hundred and fifty ^"^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^ 
men, for the purpose of protecting the inhabitants of that quarter from (^/\ ^ -flf ■•; 
the threatened depredations of the British from Boston, who were sent 
out to procure from the island cattle and other provisions, which were 
accessible to their boats. Three companies had been raised on Long 
Island, as a part of the regiments voted by the New York Congress, which 
were placed on the Continental establishment. General Schuyler had 
ordered these companies to the northward ; and as the people were thus 
left exposed to the ravages of the enemy, General Wooster wrote to the 
Commander-in-chief, suggesting that the detachment of his own regiment 
should be allowed to remain there, or be replaced by other troops. 



76 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

every application made to me here, to keep any detach- 
ments on the coast for these purposes. 

I should, therefore, most probably have thought it my 
duty to order the three companies, mentioned in 
your letter as having joined your army, to aid in the 
general service, had they not been under command 
from General Schuyler to join him ; but as it is, I can by 
no means interfere. He is engaged in a service of the 
greatest importance to the whole continent, his strength 
and appointments being far short of his expectations, and 
to give any counter orders may not only defeat his whole 
plan, but must make me responsible to the public for 
the failure. Instead, therefore, of their further stay, I 
would have them march immediately. I fear the delay 
of the ten days may have very bad effects, as, by my 
last advice from Ticonderoga, General Schuyler was to 
march in a few days for Canada ; and it is highly proba- 
ble he may depend upon these companies to occupy the 
posts of communication, which otherwise he must 
weaken his army to do. No Provincial Congress can, 
with any propriety, interfere with the disposition of 
troops on the Continental establishment, much less con- 
trol the orders of any general officer ; so that in this in- 
stance the Congress at New York have judged proper- 
ly, in declining to counteract General Schuyler's orders. 
I wish I could extend my approbation equally to the 
whole line of their conduct. Before you receive this 
letter, you will most probably be able to judge how far 
your continuance on Long Island will be farther neces- 
sary. If the fleet, which last sailed, was destined for 
those coasts, it must be arrived. If it is not, it is 
certainly gone to the eastward, and your present station 
is no longer necessary. The importance of preserving 
the communication of the North River, and many other 
reasons, induce me to wish you were returned to your 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 77 

former post. The late transactions at New York furnish 
additional reasons for your being as near that city, as is 
consistent with the discipline and convenience of your 
troops. Your next, therefore, I flatter myself, will in- 
form me of your having resumed your former station. 
I am. Sir, with much regard and esteem, &lc.*

gress, I shall this afternoon embark witli all the troops under my com- 
mand for Albany, there to wait the orders of General Schuyler." 

f In a letter to Governor Cooke, dated the 4th of August, it has been 
seen, tliat Washington suggested to liim a plan for procuring powder from 
Bermuda. Two small armed vessels had already been fitted out by Rhode 
Island, and put under the command of Captain Abraham Whipple, with 
the design of protecting the bay and coast of that province from the 
depredations of tlie enemy. The plan was approved by the Governor and 
Committee of that province, and Captain Whipple agreed to engage in 
the affinr, provided General Washington would give him a certificate 
under his own liand, that, in case the Bermudians would assist the under- 
taking, he would recommend to the Continental Congress to permit the 
exportation of provisions to those islands from the colonies ; the captain 
pledging himself at the same time, that he would make no use of such a 
paper, unless he should be opposed by the inhabitants. 

Captain Whipple sailed in the larger of the Rhode Island vessels, CoTPic, ^ i<^t'.S>^ 
manned with sixty-one seamen. Governor Cooke applied to General \^^ ■ (njut- I ¥■" S t-^ i' 
Washington to draft seamen from the army ; but this he declined, for the ' 

double reason, that he doubted his power to employ the soldiers at sea, * *H^ & ' , 
and that it woidd at any rate be attended with too much publicity. The 
vessel was manned, therefore, by the agency of the Rhode Island Com- 
mittee, and at the charge of that province. At this time a packet from 
England was daily expected at New York. It was thought desirable to 
intercept that packet, and Governor Cooke ordered Captain Whipple to 
cruise for it off the harbour of Now Yorkjburteenjdays, and, if he should

of the constitution are possessed of your most favorable 
regards and wishes for success. As descendants of 
freemen, and heirs with us of the same glorious inheri- 
tance, we flatter ourselves, that, though divided by our 
situation, we are firmly united in sentiment. The cause 
of virtue and liberty is confined to no continent or cli- 
mate. It comprehends, within its capacious limits, the 
wise and good, however dispersed and separated in 
space or distance. 

You need not be informed, that the violence and ra- 
pacity of a tyrannic ministry have forced the citizens of 
America, your brother colonists, into arms. We equally 
detest and lament the prevalence of those counsels, 

not fall in with it during that period, then to proceed immediately on his 
voyage to Bermuda. But he had scarcely sailed from Providence, before 
an account appeared in the newspapers of one hundred barrels of powder 
^ having been taken from Bermuda, by a vessel supposed to be from Philadel- 

CfrlA^vX-^X. °1j-- phia, and another from Soutli Carolina. The facts were such, as to make 
uf^iXj I ^"i-t it in the highest degree probable, that this was the same powder, which 

Captain Whipple had gone to procure. General Washington and Gover- 
nor Cooke were both of opinion, tliat it was best to countermand his in- 
structions. The other armed vessel of Rhode Island was immediately 
despatched in search of the captain, with orders, that, when he had 
finished the cruise in quest of the packet, he should return to Providence. 
But it was too late. Captain Whipple had heard of the arrival of the 
packet at New York, and proceeded on his voyage to Bermuda. 

He put in at the west end of the island. The inhabitants were at first 
alarmed, supposing him to command a King's armed vessel, and the 
women and children fled into tlie country ; but, when he showed his com- 
mission and instructions, they treated him with much cordiality and friend- 
ship. They had assisted in removing the powder, which was made known 
to General Gage, and he had sent a sloop of war to take away all the 
superfluous provisions from the island. They professed themselves hearty 
friends to the American cause, but as Captain Whipple was defeated in 
the object of his voyage he returned speedily to Providence.— Gov. 
Cooke's MS. Letters. 

Soon afterwards the inhabitants of Bermuda petitioned Congress for 
relief, representing their great distress, in consequence of the non-impor- 
tation agreement, which deprived them of the supplies, that usually came 
from the colonies. In consideration of their being friendly to tlie cause 
of America, it was resolved by Congress, that provisions in certain quanti- 
ties might be exported to them. lourn. of Coiig. .Nov. 22rf.

which have led to the eflusion of so much human blood, 
and left us no alternative but a civil war, or a base sub- 
mission. The wise Disposer of all events has hitherto 
smiled upon our virtuous efforts. Those mercenary 
troops, a few of whom lately boasted of subjugating 
this vast continent, have been checked in their earliest 
ravages, and are now actually encircled within a small 
space ; their arms disgraced, and themselves suffering 
all the calamities of a siege. The virtue, spirit, and 
union of the provinces leave them nothing to feai-, but 
the want of ammunition. The application of our ene- 
mies to foreign states, and their vigilance upon our 
coasts, are the only efforts they have made against us 
with success. 

Under these 'circumstances, and with these senti- 
ments, we have turned our eyes to you. Gentlemen, for 
relief. We are informed, that there is a very large 
magazine in your island under a very feeble guard. 
We would not wish to involve you in an opposition, in 
which, from your situation, we should be unable to sup- 
port you ; we knew not, therefore, to what extent to 
solicit your assistance, in availing ourselves of this 
supply ; but, if your favor and friendship to North 
America and its liberties have not been misrepresented, 
I persuade myself you may, consistently Avith your own 
safety, promote and further this scheme, so as to give it 
the fairest prospect of success. Be assured, that, in 
this case, the whole power and exertion of my influ- 
ence will be made with the honorable Continental Con- 
gress, that your island may not only be supplied with 
provisions, but experience every other mark of affection 
and friendship, which the grateful citizens of a free 
country can bestow on its brethren and benefactors. I 
am, &c.

TO THE MAJOR AND BRIGADIER GENERALS. 

Circular. 

Hl-X^ C^ClX . O C) Camp at Cambridge, 8 September, 1775. 



Cv /. 



Gentlemen, 

As I mean to call upon you in a day or two for your 
opinions upon a point of very great importance to the 
welfare of this continent in general, and this colony in 
particular, I think it proper, indeed an incumbent duty 
on me, previous to this meeting to intimate to you the 
end and design of it, that you may have time to con- 
sider the matter with that deliberation and attention, 
which the importance of it requires. 

It is to know, whether, in your judgment, we cannot 
make a successful attack upon the troops at Boston by 
means of boats, in cooperation with an attempt upon theu" 
lines at Roxbury. The success of such an enterprise 
depends, I well know, upon the All-wise Disposer of 
events, and it is not within the reach of human wisdom 
to foretell the issue ; but if the prospect is fair, the un- 
dertaking is justifiable for the following, among other 
reasons, which might be assigned. 

The season is now fast approaching, when warm and 
comfortable barracks must be erected for the security 
of the troops against the inclemency of winter. Large 
and costly provision must be made in the article of 
wood for the supply of the army ; and after all that can 
be done in this way, it is but too probable that fences, 
woods, orchards, and even houses themselves will fall a 
sacrifice to the want of fuel before the end of winter. 
A very considerable difficulty, if not expense, must ac- 
crue on account of clothing for the men now engaged in 
the service ; and if they do not enlist again, this difficulty 
will be increased to an almost insurmountable degree. 



PartIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 81 

Blankets, 1 am informed, are now much wanted, and 
not to be got. How then shall we be able to keep sol- 
diers to their duty, already impatient to get home, when 
they come to feel the severity of winter without proper 
covering ? If this army should not feel inclined to en- 
gage for a longer time than the 1 st of January, what 
consequences more certainly can follow, than that you 
must either be obliged to levy new troops and thereby 
have two sets, or partly so, in pay at the same time, or 
by disbanding one before you get the other, expose the 
country to desolation and the cause perhaps to irretriev- 
able ruin. These things are not unknown to the en- 
emy ; perhaps it is the very ground they are building 
on, if they are not waiting for a large reinforcement ; and 
if they are waiting for succours, ought it not to give a 
spur to the attempt ? Our powder, not much of which 
will be consumed in such an enterprise, without any 
certainty of a supply, is daily wasting ; and, to sum up 
the whole, the expense of supporting this army will 
so far exceed any idea, that was formed in Congress 
of it, that I do not know what will be the conse- 
quences. 

These, among other reasons, which might be as- 
signed, induce me to wish a speedy termination of the 
dispute ; but to avoid these evils we are not to lose sight 
of the difficulties, the hazard, and the loss, that may 
accompany the attempt, nor what will be the probable 
consequences of a failure. 

That every circumstance for and against this measure 
may be duly weighed, that there may be time for doing 
it, and nothing of this importance resolved on, but after 
mature deliberation, I give this previous notice of the 
intention of calling you together on Monday next at 
nine o'clock, at which time you are requested to attend 
at head-quarters. It is unnecessary, I am persuaded, 

VOL. III. 11 



82 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 4a 

to recommend secrecy. The success of the enterprise, 
if undertaken, must depend in a great measure upon the 
suddenness of the stroke. I am with great esteem, &.C.* 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 
IaI^ GjtyCU, ■ 7 Camp at Cambridge, 8 September, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your favor of the 31st of August. I 
am much engaged in sending off the detachment under 
Colonel Arnold, upon the plan contained in mine of the 
20th ultimo. A variety of obstacles have retarded us, 
since the express returned with yours of the 27th from 
Albany ; but we are now in such forwardness, that I 
expect they will set out by Sunday next at farthest. I 
shall take care in my instructions to Colonel Arnold, 
that, in case there should be a junction of the detach- 
ment with your army, you shall have no difficulty in ad- 
justing the scale of command. 

You seem so sensible of the absolute necessity of 
preserving the friendship of the Canadians, that I need 
say nothing on that subject ; except that a strict disci- 
pline, and punctual payment for all necessaries brought 
to your camp, will be the most certain means of attain- 
ing so valuable and important an end. I shall inculcate 
the same principle most strongly on our troops, who go 
from hence, as that on which their safety, success, and 
honor entirely depend. 

I am truly concerned, that your supplies and appoint-

assigned, it was unanimously agreed, that, " considering the state of the 
enemy's lines, and the expectation of soon receiving some important ad- 
vices from England, it was not expedient to make the attempt."

merits are so far short of your expectations; but I trust J-jj-t,^^, - ■ -• > 

you will have a feeble enemy to contend with, and a 7-^<_^

weight in the scale. Your situation for some time must ___ ' ' 

be so critical and interesting, that I hope you will not 

fail to give me constant information of your motions and 

success. 

Believe me, with much truth and regard, dear Sir, 
your obedient and humble servant. 



TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Camp at Cambridge, 8 September, 1775. 

Sir, 

Upon the receipt of this you will please to give direc- 
tions, that all the new levies march immediately to this 
camp. By a resolution of Congress, the troops on the 
Continental establishment were not to be employed for 
the defence of the coasts, or of any particular province, 
the militia being deemed competent to that service. 
When I directed these troops to remain in their own 
province, I had some reason to expect a remove from 
Boston to New York, in which case they would have 
been able to give the enemy a more speedy opposition ; 
but as that suspicion now appears groundless, there will 
be an impropriety in continuing them where they now 
are, considering the above resolve. 

The detachment, which I mentioned in my last, will 
march in two days, and I shall have occasion for the 
troops from you to fill their places. The ministerial ex- 
pedition must, I apprehend, by this time have come to 
some issue ; they are either returned with disappoint- 
ment, or have succeeded in their errand ; in either case 
the men can be spared without danger to the country. 



7^ 



§4 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

But should this not be the case, and they are still hov- 
ering on the coast, it is to make no difference in their 
march ; so that I shall at all events expect them here 
next week, for which you will please to give the neces- 
sary orders. I am, &lc. 



TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. 

Camp at Cambridge, 10 September, 1775. 

Dear Brother, 

So little has happened since the date of my last, that 
I should scarcely have given you the trouble of reading 
this letter, did I not imagine that it might be some saUs- 
faction to you to know, that Ave are well, and in no fear 
or dread of the enemy ; being, in our own opinion at 
least, very securely intrenched, and wishing for nothing 
more than to see the enemy out of their strong-holds, 
that the dispute may come to an issue. The inactive 
state we lie in is extremely disagreeable, especially as 
we can see no end to it, having had no advices lately 
from Great Britain to form a judgment upon. 

In taking possession, about a fortnight ago, of a hill 
within point-blank cannon-shot of the enemy's lines on 
Charlestown Neck, we expected to bring on a general 
action, especially as we had been threatened by reports 
from Boston several days before, that the enemy in- 
tended an attack upon our intrenchments. Nothing, 
however, followed but a severe cannonade for a day or 
two, and a bombardment afterwards for the like time ; 
which, however, did us no other damage, than to kill 
two or three men, and to wound as many more. Both 
are now at an end, as they found that we disregarded 
their fire, and continued our works till we had got them 
completed. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 85 

Unless the ministerial troops in Boston are waiting 
for reinforcements, I cannot devise what they are stay- 
ing there for, nor why, as they affect to despise the 
Americans, they do not come forth, and put an end to 
the contest at once. They sufler greatly for want of 
fresh provisions, notwithstanding they have pillaged 
from several islands a good many sheep and cattle. 
They are also scarce of fuel, unless, according to the 
account of one of their deserters, they mean to pull 
down houses for that article. In short, they are, from 
all accounts, suffering all the inconveniences of a siege. 
It is true, from their having the entire command of the 
sea, and a powerful navy, and, moreover, as they are now 
beginning to take all vessels indiscriminately, we cannot 
stop their supplies through that channel ; but their suc- 
cours in this way have not been so powerful, as to ena- 
ble them to give the common soldiers much fresh meat 
as yet. By an account from Boston, of the 4th instant, 
the cattle lately brought in there sold at public auction 
from fifteen to thirty-four pounds ten shillings sterling 
apiece ; and the sheep from thirty to thirty-six shillings 
each ; and fowls and every other species of fresh pro- 
visions went in proportion. The expense of this, one 
would think, must soon tire them, were it not, that 
they intend to fix all the expense of this war upon the 
colonies, — if they can, I suppose we shall add. 

I am just sending off a detachment of one thousand 
men to Quebec, by the way of Kennebec River, to co- d^^ ^VVi-w-j ^ 
operate with General Schuyler, who by this time is, I fCl^f- v^ f^ ^^''

there, he will soon after be in Montreal without oppo- 
sition ; and if the detachment I am sending from hence, 
though late in the season, should be able to get posses- 
sion of Quebec, the ministry's plan, in respect to that 
government, will be defeated. 

I have only to add my love to my sister and the little 
ones, and that I am, with the greatest truth, your most 
aflfectionate brother. 



/^ 



e, a, /s'x. I. st- 



TO COLONEL BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

Instructions. 

1. You are immediately on their march from Cam- 
bridge to take the command of the detachment from 
the Continental army against Quebec, and use all pos- 
sible expedition, as the winter season is now advancing, 
and the success of this enterprise, under God, depends 
wholly upon the spirit with which it is pushed, and the 
favorable dispositions of the Canadians and Indians. 

2. When you come to Newburyport you are to 
make all possible inquiry, what men-of-war or cruis- 
ers there may be on the coast, to which this detach- 
ment may be exposed on their voyage to Kennebec 
River ; and, if you should find that there is danger of 
your being intercepted, you are not to proceed by 
water, but by land, taking care on the one hand not to 
be diverted by light and vague reports, and on the 
other not to expose the troops rashly to a danger, 
which by many judicious persons has been deemed 
very considerable. 

3. You are, by every means in your power, to en- 
deavour to discover the real sentiments of the Cana- 
dians towards our cause, and particularly as to this 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 87 

expedition, bearing in mind, that if they are averse to it 
and will not cooperate, or at least willingly acquiesce, it 
must fail of success. In this case you are by no means 
to prosecute the attempt ; the expense of the expedi- 
tion, and the disappointment, are not to be put in com- 
petition with the dangerous consequences, which may 
ensue from irritating them against us, and detaching 
them from that neutrality, which they have adopted. 

4. In order to cherish those favorable sentiments 
to the American cause, that they have manifested, you 
are, as soon as you arrive in their country, to disperse a 
number of the addresses you will have with you, par- 
ticularly in those parts, where your route shall lie ; and 
observe the strictest disfcipline and good order, by no 
means suffering any inhabitant to be abused, or in any 
manner injured, either in his person or property, pun- 
ishing with exemplary severity every person, who shall 
transgress, and making ample compensation to the party 
injured. 

5. You are to endeavour, on the other hand, to 
conciliate the affections of those people, and such In- 
dians as you may meet with, by every means in your 
power; convincing them, that we come, at the request 
of many of their principal people, not as robbers or to 
make war upon them, but as the friends and supporters 
of their liberties as well as ours. And to give efficacy 
to these sentiments, you must carefully inculcate upon 
the officers and soldiers under your command, that, not 
only the good of their country and their honor, but 
their safety, depend upon the treatment of these people. 

6. Check every idea and crush in its earliest stage 
every attempt to plunder even those, who are known 
to be enemies to our cause. It will create dread- 
ful apprehensions in our friends, and, when it is once 
begun, no one can tell where it will stop. I there- 



88 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Er. 43, 

fore again most expressly order, that it be discouraged 
and punished in every instance without distinction. 

7. Any King's stores, which you shall be so fortu- 
nate as to possess yourself of, are to be secured for the 
Continental use, agreeably to the rules and regulations 
of war published by the honorable Congress. The 
officers and men may be assured, that any extraordinary 
services performed by them will be suitably rewarded. 

8. Spare neither pains nor expense to gain all 
possible intelligence on your march, to prevent surprises 
and accidents of every kind, and endeavour if possible 
to correspond with General Schuyler, so that you may 
act in concert with him. This, I think, may be done by 
means of the St. Francis Indians. 

9. In case of a union with General Schuyler, or 
if he should be in Canada upon your arrival there, you 
are by no means to consider yourself as upon a separate 
and independent command, but are to put yourself un- 
der him and follow his directions. Upon this occasion, 
and all others, I recommend most earnesdy to avoid all 
contention about rank. In such a cause every post is 
honorable, in which a man can serve his country. 

10. If Lord Chatham's son should be in Canada, 
and in any way should fall into your power, you are en- 
joined to treat him with all possible deference and re- 
spect. You cannot err in paying too much honor to 
the son of so illustrious a character, and so true a friend 
to America. Any other prisoners, who may fall into 
your hands, you will treat with as much humanity and 
kindness, as may be consistent with your own safety 
and the public interest. Be very particular in restrain- 
ing, not only your own troops, but the Indians, from all 
acts of cruelty and insult, Avhich will disgrace the 
American arms, and irritate our fellow subjects against 
us. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 89 

11. You will be particularly careful to pay the 
full value for all provisions, or other accommodations, 
which the Canadians may provide for you on your 
march. By no means press them or any of their cattle 
into your service, but amply compensate those, who 
voluntarily assist you. For this purpose you are pro- 
vided with a sum of money in specie, which you will 
use with as much frugality and economy, as your ne- 
cessities and good policy will admit, keeping as exact 
an account as possible of your disbursements. 

12. You are by every opportunity to inform me 
of your progress, your prospects, and intelligence, and 
upon any important occurrence to send an express. 

13. As the season is now far advanced, you are 
to make all possible despatch ; but if unforeseen difficul- 
ties should arise, or if the weather should become so 
severe, as to render it hazardous to proceed, in your 
own judgment and that of your principal officers, whom 
you are to consult, — in that case you are to return, giv- 
ing me as early notice as possible, that I may render 
you such assistance as may be necessary. 

14. As the contempt of the religion of a country 
by ridiculing any of its ceremonies, or affronting its min- 
isters or votaries, has ever been deeply resented, you 
are to be particularly careful to restrain every officer 
and soldier from such imprudence and folly, and to 
punish every instance of it. On the other hand, as far 
as lies in your power, you are to protect and support the 
free exercise of the religion of the country, and the un- 
disturbed enjoyment of the rights of conscience in re- 
ligious matters, with your utmost influence and authority. 

Given under my hand, at head-quarters, Cambridge, 
this 14th day of September, 1775.*

90 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [iEr. 43. 

TO COLONEL BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

Camp at Cambridge, 14 September, 1775. 

Sir, 
You are entrusted with a command of the utmost 
consequence to the interest and liberties of America. 
Upon your conduct and courage, and that of the officers 
and soldiers detached on this expedition, not only the 
success of the present enteqorise, and your own honor, 
but the safety and welfare of the whole continent may 
depend. I charge you, therefore, and the officers and 
soldiers under your command, as you value your own 
safety and honor, and the favor and esteem of your 
country, that you consider yourselves, as marching not 
through the country of an enemy, but of our friends and 
brethren, for such the inhabitants of Canada, and the 
Indian nations, have approved themselves in this un- 
happy contest between Great Britain and America; 
and that you check, by every motive of duty and fear of 
punishment, every attempt to plunder or insult the in- 
habitants of Canada. Should any American soldier be 
so base and infamous as to injure any Canadian or In- 
dian, in his person or property, I do most earnestly en- 
join you to bring him to such severe and exemplary 
punishment, as the enormity of the crime may require. 
Should it extend to death itself, it will not be dispro- 
pordoned to its guilt, at such a time and in such a cause. 
But I hope and trust, that the brave men, who have 
voluntarily engaged in this expedition, will be governed 

and the names and rank of the principal officers engaged, may be seen in 
the Collections of the Maine Historical Society, Vol. I. pp. 341-416. 

Colonel Arnold was much assisted by a set of plans and a journal fur- 
nished by Mr. Samuel Goodwin, of Pownalborough in Maine, who had 
y* resided twenty-five years in that country as a surveyor, and was well ac- 

quainted with the waters of the Kennebec, and the route to the Chaudiere 
River in Canada.

by far different views ; and that order, discipline, and 
regularity of behaviour, will be as conspicuous as their 
valor. I also give it in charge to you to avoid all disre- 
spect of the religion of the country, and its ceremonies. 
Prudence, policy, and a true Christian spirit, will lead 
us to look with compassion upon their errors without 
insulting them. While w^e are contending for our own 
liberty, we should be very cautious not to violate the 
rights of conscience in others, ever considering that God 
alone is the judge of the hearts of men, and to him only 
in this case they are answerable. 

Upon the whole, Sir, I beg you to inculcate upon the 
officers and soldiers the necessity of preserving the 
strictest order during the march through Canada; to 
represent to them the shame, disgrace, and ruin to them- 
selves and their country, if they should by their conduct 
turn the hearts of our brethren in Canada against us ; 
and, on the other hand, the honors and rewards, which 
await them, if by their prudence and good behaviour 
they conciliate the affections of the Canadians and In- 
dians to the great interests of America, and convert 
those favorable dispositions they have shown into a last- 
ing union and affection. Thus washing you, and the 
officers and soldiers under your command, all honor, 
safety, and success, I remain. Sir, your most obedient 
humble servant.

Friends and Brethren, 

The unnatural contest between the English colonies 
and Great Britain has now risen to such a height, that 
arms alone must decide it. The colonies, confiding in 
the justice of their cause, and the purity of their inten- 
tions, have reluctantly appealed to that Being, in whose 
hands are all human events. He has hitherto smiled 
upon their virtuous efforts, the hand of tyranny has 
been arrested in its ravages, and the British arms, which 
have shone with so much splendor in every part of the 
globe, are now tarnished with disgrace and disappoint- 
ment. Generals of approved experience, who boasted 
of subduing this great continent, find themselves cir- 
cumscribed within the limits of a single city and its sub- 
urbs, suffering all the shame and distress of a siege, 
while the free-born sons of America, animated by the 
genuine principles of liberty and love of their country, 
with increasing union, firmness, and discipline, repel 
every attack, and despise every danger. 

Above all we rejoice, that our enemies have been 
deceived with regard to you. They have persuaded 
themselves, they have even dared to say, that the Ca- 
nadians were not capable of distinguishing between the 
blessings of liberty, and the wretchedness of slavery ; 
that gratifying the vanity of a litde circle of nobility 
would blind the people of Canada. By such artifices 
they hoped to bend you to their views, but they have 
been deceived; instead of finding in you a poverty 
of soul and baseness of spirit, they see with a chagrin.

equal to our joy, that j-ou are enlightened, generous,

us in an indissoluble union, let us run together to the 
same goal. We have taken up arms in defence of our 
liberty, our property, our w-ives, and our children ; we 
are determined to preserve them, or die. We look for- 
ward with pleasure to that day, not far remote, we 
hope, when the inhabitants of America shall have one 
sentiment, and the full enjoyment of the blessings of a 
free government. 

Incited by these motives, and encouraged by the ad- 
vice of many friends of liberty among you, the grand 
American Congress have sent an army into your prov- 
ince, under the command of General Schuyler, not to 
plunder, but to protect you; to animate, and bring 
into action those sentiments of freedom you have dis- 
closed, and which the tools of despotism would extin- 
guish through the whole creation. To cooperate with 
this design, and to frustrate those cruel and perfidious 
schemes, which would deluge our frontiers with the 
blood of women and children, I have detached Colonel 
Arnold into your country, with a part of the army under 
my command. I have enjoined it upon him, and I am 
certain that he will consider himself, and act, as in the 
country of his patrons and best friends. Necessaries 
and accommodations of every kind, which you may fur- 
nish, he will thankfully receive, and render the full 
value. I invite you therefore as friends and brethren, 
to provide him with such supphes as your country af- 
fords ; and I pledge myself, not only for your safety and 
security, but for an ample compensation. Let no man 
desert his habitation ; let no one flee as before an enemy. 

The cause of America, and of liberty, is the cause of

every virtuous American citizen ; whatever may be his 
religion or descent, the United Colonies know no dis- 
tinction but such as slavery, corruption, and arbitrary 
dominion may create. Come, then, ye generous citi- 
zens, range yourselves under the standard of general 
liberty, against which all the force and artifices of tyr- 
anny will never be able to prevail. 



TO THOMAS EVERARD, VIRGINIA. 

Camp at Cambridge, 17 September, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

As I believe it will be three years next December 
since some of my Ohio lands (under the proclamation of 
1 754) were patented ; and as they are not yet improved 
agreeably to the express letter of the law, it behoves 
me to have recourse, in time, to the common expedient 
of saving them by means of a friendly petition. My 
distance from Williamsburg, and my ignorance of the 
mode of doing this, lays me under the necessity of call- 
ing upon some friend for assistance. Will yau, then, 
my good Sir, aid me in this work ? I shall acknowledge 
it as a singular favor if you will, and, unless you discour- 
age me, I shall rely on it. 

I have already been at as much expense in attempt- 
ing to seat and improve these lands, as would nearly if 
not quite have saved them, agreeably to our act of As- 
sembly, had it been laid out thereon. In March, 1774, 
I sent out more than twenty servants and hirelings, with 
a great number of tools, nails, and necessaries for this 
purpose ; but, hostilities commencing with the Indians, 
they got no further than the Red-stone settlement, 
where the people dispersed, my goods were seized and 
lost, and the whole expedition, which I suppose stood 



PartU.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 95 

me in at least three hundred pounds, came to nothing. 
In March last, I again purchased servants, and hired 
men at considerable wages, and sent out a second time ; 
but what they have done, I neither know nor have 
heard, further than that, after buying tools and pro- 
visions at most exorbitant prices, and not being able to 
procure a sufficiency of the latter, my servants, for the 
most part, had run away, and the manager with a few 
negroes and hirelings was left in an almost starving con- 
dition. This, Sir, is my situation ; and to avoid a total loss 
of the lands (as I conceive there are some peculiar cir- 
cumstances attending the matter, on account of other 
claims), and to prevent involving myself in any disa- 
greeable controversy in defence of my property, having 
already had a great deal of trouble about it, I am de- 
sirous of adopting in proper time the method of peti- 
tioning. 

The enemy and we are very near neighbours. Our 
advanced works are not more than five or six hundred 
yards from theirs, and the main bodies of the two armies 
scarcely a mile apart. We see every thing that passes, 
and that is all we can do, as they keep close on the two 
peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown, both of which 
are surrounded by ships of war and floating batteries ; 
and the narrow necks of land leading into them are for- 
tified in such a manner as not to be forced, without a 
very considerable slaughter, if practicable at all. 

I am, with esteem, dear Sir, &c.

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL, 
JlV^CiCi, ^^ Cambridge, 21 September, 1775.* 

Sir, 
It gives me real concern to observe by yours of the 
15th instant, that you should think it necessary to dis- 
tinguish between my personal and public character, and 
confine your esteem to the former. Upon a reperusal 
of mine of the 8th instant, I cannot think it bears the 
construction you have put upon it; and, unless that con- 
struction was the most obvious, I should have hoped 
that the respect I really have for you, and which I 
flattered myself I had manifested, Avould have called 
for the most favorable. In the disposition of the Con- 

* The British men-of-war had been menacing the coasts of Connecti- 
cut, and Governor Trumbull, in addition to the militia near the seaboard, 
had ordered several companies of the new levies, raised for the Continental 
army, to be retained in the province, and stationed at places where the 
greatest danger was apprehended. Of this he had given notice to Wash- 
ington in a letter of the 5th, but on the 8th the General sent an express 
order to have all the new levies marched to the army. The Governor 
complied with the order, though apparently not well pleased with the 
manner in which it was given. In his answer, dated the 15th, he says ; — 

" I am surprised that mine of the 5th instant was not received, or not 
judged worthy of notice, as no mention is made of it. Stonington had 
been attacked, and severely cannonaded, and by Divine Providence mar- 
vellously protected. New London and Norwich are still so menaced by 
the ministerial ships and troops, that the militia cannot be thought suffi- 
cient for their security, and it is necessary to throw up some intrench- 
ments. We are obliged actually to raise more men for their security, and 
for the towns of New Haven and Lyme. I hoped some of the new levies 
might have been left here, till these dangers were over, without injury to 
any of your operations. I own that it must be left to your judgment. Yet 
it woidd have given me pleasure to have been acquainted that you con- 
sidered it. I tliank Divine Providence and you for this early warning to 
great care and watchfulness, that so the union of the colonies may be set- 
tled on a permanent and happy basis. 

" You may depend on our utmost e,xertions for the defence and security 
of the constitutional rights and liberty of the colonies, and of our own in 
particular. None has shown greater forwardness, and thereby rendered 
itself more the object of ministerial vengeance. I am, with great esteem 
and regard for your personal character," &c.

tinental troops, I have long been sensible that it would 
be impossible to please, not individuals merely, but 
particular provinces, whose partial necessities would 
occasionally call for assistance. I therefore thought 
myself happy, that the Congress had setded the point, 
and apprehended I should stand excused to all, for act- 
ing in the line, which not only appeared to me to be 
that of policy and propriety, but of express and posidve 
duty. If, to the other fatigues and cares of my stadon, 
that is to be added of giving reasons for all orders, and 
explaining the grounds and principles on which they are 
formed, my personal trouble would perhaps be of the 
least concern. The public would be most affected. 
You may be assured. Sir, nothing was intended that 
might be construed into disrespect ; and, at so interest- 
ing a period, nothing less ought to disturb the harmony 
so necessary for the happy success of our public opera- 
tions. 

The omission of acknowledging, in precise terms, 
the receipt of your favor of the 5th instant was purely 
accidental. The subject was not so new to me as to 
require long consideration. I had had occasion fully to 
deliberate upon it, in consequence of applications for 
troops from Cape Ann, Machias, New Hampshire, and 
Long Island, where the same necessity was as strongly 
pleaded, and, in the tv%-o last instances, the most pe- 
remptory orders were necessary to prevent the troops 
from being detained. I foresaw the same difficulty here. 
I am by no means insensible to the situation of the 
people on the coast. I wish I could extend protection 
to all ; but the numerous detachments, necessary to 
remedy the evil, would amount to the dissolution of the 
army, or make the most important operations of the 
campaign depend upon the piraUcal expeditions of two 
or three men-of-war and transports.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp at Cambridge, 21 September, 1775. 



Sir, 

u^£, > /.>'i , 'pj^g mode in which the present army has been col- 

f f^ ■ lected has occasioned some difficulty, in procuring the 

subscription of both officers and soldiers to the Conti- 
nental articles of war. Their principal objection has 
been, that it might subject them to a longer service, 
than that for which they engaged under their several 
provincial establishments. It is in vain to attempt to 
reason away the prejudices of a whole army, often in- 
stilled, and in this instance at least encouraged, by the 
officers from private and narrow views. I have there- 
fore forborne pressing them, as I did not experience any 
such inconvenience from their adherence to their former 
rules, as would warrrant the risk of entering into a con- 
test upon it ; more especially as the restraints, necessary 
for the establishment of essential discipline and subordi- 

^ * In reply, Governor Trumbull wrote ; — "I have no disposition to in- 

•j ^ ^ .^ crease the weight of your burdens, which, in the multiplicity of your 

business, must be sufficiently heavy, nor inclination to disturb the harmony 
so necessary to the happy success of our public operations, f! am per- 
suaded no such difficulty will any more happen. It is unhappy, that 
jealousies should be excited, or disputes of any sort litigated, between 
any of the colonies, to disunite them at a time, when our liberty, our 
property, our all is at stake. If our enemies prevail, which our disunion 
may occasion, our jealousies will then appear frivolous, and all our dispu- 
ted claims of no value to either side." 



1'artII.] 'rillO AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 99 

nation, indisposed their minds to every change, and 
made it both duty and policy to introduce as little novel- 
ty as possible. With the present army, I fear such a 
subscription is impracticable ; but the difficulty will 
cease with this army.* 

The Connecticut and Rhode Island troops stand en- 
gaged to the 1st of December only ; and none longer 
than the 1st of January. A dissolution of the present 
army therefore will take place, unless some early pro- 
vision is made against such an event. Most of the 
general officers are of opinion, that the greater part of 
them may be reenlisted for the winter, or another cam- 
paign, with the indulgence of a furlough to visit their 
friends, which may be regulated so as not to endanger 
the service. How far it may be proper to form the 
new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, 
rather than from the contingents of the several provin- 
ces, is a question which involves in it too many con- 
siderations of policy and prudence, for me to undertake 
to decide. It appears to be impossible to draw it from 
any other source than the old army, for this winter; 
and, as the pay is ample, I hope a sufficient number will 
enga2;e in the service for that time at least. But there 
are various opinions of the temper of the men on the 
subject ; and there may be great hazard in deferring the 
trial too long. 

In the Continental establishment no provision has been 
made for the pay of artificers, distinct from that of the 
common soldiers ; whereas, under the provincial such 
as found their own tools w-ere allowed one shilling per 
diem advance, and particular artisans more. The pay 
of the artillery, also, now differs from that of the prov-

ince ; the men have less, the officers more ; and, for 
some ranks, no provision is made, as the Congress will 
please to observe by the list, which I have the honor to 
enclose. These particulars, though seemingly incon- 
siderable, are the source of much complaint and dis- 
satisfaction, which I endeavour to compose in the best 
manner I am able. 

By the returns of the rifle companies, and that battal- 
ion, they appear to exceed their establishment very 
considerably. I doubt my authority to pay these extra 
men without the direction of the Congress ; but it would 
be deemed a great hardship wholly to refuse them, as 
they have been encouraged to come.* 

The necessities of the troops having required pay, I 
directed that those of the Massachusetts should receive 
for one month, upon their being mustered, and returning 
a proper roll ; but a claim was immediately made for 
pay by lunar months ; and several regiments have de- 
clined taking up their warrants on this account. As 
this practice was entirely new to me, though said to be 

* The Continental Congress resolved on the 14th of June, the day 
before the appointment of the Commander-in-chief, that six companies of 
expert riflemen should be raised in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, and 
two in Virginia. On the 22d, it was again resolved, that two more com- 
panies should be raised in Pennsylvania, and that the eight together should 
make a battalion, to be commanded by such field-officers, captains, and 
lieutenants, as should be recommended by the Assembly or Convention of 
the colony. The above twelve companies were all filled up with surpris- 
ing celerity. One company arrived in Cambridge on the 25th of July, 
and eight others before the 14th of August, so that within two months 
orders had gone out, the men had been enlisted and equipped, and the 
whole had marched from four to seven hundred miles to camp. Captain 
Daniel Morgan, so much celebrated during the war, commanded one of 
these companies. He marched his men from Frederic county in Virginia, 
a distance of six hundred miles, in three weeks. 

Congress had fixed the number of each company at eighty-two. When 
they arrived at Cambridge, the number considerably exceeded that limit, 
and the Commander doubted whether he was authorized to pay the super- 
numeraries. When the committee of Concrress afterwards visited the 



PartIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 101 

warranted by former usage here, the matter now \^•aits 
the determination of the honorable Congress. I find, 
in Connecticut and Rhode Island, this point was settled 
by calendar months ; in Massachusetts, though men- 
tioned in the Congress, it was left undetermined ; which 
is also the case of New Hampshire. 

Enclosed is a petition from the subalterns, respecting 
their pay. Where thei-e are only two of these in a 
company, I have considered one as an ensign, and 
ordered him pay as such, as in the Connecticut forces. 
I must beg leave to recommend this petition to the fa- 
vor of the Congress, as I am of opinion the allowance 
is inadequate to their rank and service, and is one great 
source of that famiharity between the officers and men, 
which is so incompatible with subordination and disci- 
pline. Many valuable officers of those ranks, finding 
themselves unable to support the character and appear- 
ance of officers, I am informed, will retire as soon as 
the term of service is expired, if there is no alteration. 

For the better regulation of duty, I found it neces- 
sary to setde the rank of the officers, and to number 
the regiments ; and, as I had not received the com- 
mands of the Congress on the subject, and the exigence 
of the service forbade any farther delay, the general 
officers were considered as having no regiments ; an 

cainp, and this subject was referred to thern, it was decided tiiat they should 
all receive pay, but that the General should select from each company 
such as were not marksmen, and dismiss thera, with an allowance of pay 
to go home. Dr. Gordon says [Hist. Vol. II. p. 69), that all these men 
were embodied and brought to camp " without a fartiiing advanced from 
the Continental treasury." This is an error. Accounts were forwarded 
to General Washington from Congress, amounting to more than six thou- 
sand pounds, Pennsylvania cmTency, for money and articles advanced to 
them, which sum was deducted from their future pay. These riflemen 
were enlisted for one year, and were tlie first troops ordered to be raised 
by the Continental Congress. The Pennsylvania battalion was comman- 
ded by Colonel William Thompson. 



102 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 43. 

alteration, which, I understand, is not pleasing to some 
of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, 
when it was considered, that, by this means, the whole 
army is put upon one footing, and all particular attach- 
ments are dissolved.* 

I am now to inform the honorable Congress, that, 
encouraged by the repeated declarations of the Cana- 
dians and Indians, and urged by their requests, I have 
detached Colonel Arnold with a thousand men, to pene- 
trate into Canada by way of Kennebec River, and, if 
possible, to make himself master of Quebec. By this 
manoeuvre, I proposed either to divert Carleton from 
St. John's, which would leave a free passage to Gene- 
ral Schuyler ; or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in 
its present defenceless state, must fall into his hands an 
easy prey. I made all possible inquiry, as to the dis- 
tance, the safety of the route, and the danger of the 
season being too far advanced ; but found nothing in 
either to deter me from proceeding, more especially as 
it met with very general appi-obation from all whom I 
consulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, 
to enable me to judge of its propriety and probable 
consequences, I communicated it by express to General 
Schuyler, who approved of it in such terms, that I re- 
solved to put it in immediate execution. They have 
now left this place seven days ; and, if favored with a 
good wind, I hope soon to hear of their being safe in 
Kennebec River. For the satisfaction of the Congress, 
I here enclose a copy of the proposed route. I also do 
myself the honor of enclosing a manifesto, which I 

* The Continental commissions were issued on the 20th. It was 
published in the orders, that " no person is to presume to demand a 
Continental commission, who is not in actual possession of the like 
commission from the proper authority of the colony, which he is engaged 
to serve."

caused to be printed here, and of which Colonel Ar- 
nold has taken a suitable number with him. I have 
also forwarded a copy of his instructions. From all 
which, I hope the Congress will have a clear view of 
the motives, plan, and intended execution of this enter- 
prise, and that I shall be so happy as to meet with their 
approbation in it. 

I was the more induced to make this detachment, as 
it is my clear opinion, from a careful observation of the 
movements of the enemy, corroborated by all the intehi- 
gence we receive by deserters and others (of the for- 
mer of whom we have some every day), that the enemy 
have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. 
They have been wholly employed for some time past in 
procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other 
preparations for winter. These circumstances, with the 
constant additions to their works, which are apparently 
defensive, have led to the above conclusion, and enabled 
me to spare this body of men where I hope they will 
be usefully and successfully employed. 

The state of inactivity, in w^hich this army has lain 
for some time, by no means corresponds with my wish- 
es to relieve my country, by some decisive stroke, 
from the heavy expense its subsistence must create. 
After frequently reconnoitring the situation of the ene- 
my in the town of Boston, collecting all possible intelli- 
gence, and digesting the whole, a surprise did not ap- 
pear to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I 
communicated it to the general officers some days be- 
fore I called them to a council, that they might be pre- 
pared with their opinions. The result I have the honor 
of enclosing. I cannot say that I have wholly laid it 
aside ; but new events may occasion new measures. 
Of this I hope the honorable Congress can need no as- 
surance, that there is not a man in America, who more 



104 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEr.43. 

earnestly wishes such a termination of the campaign, as 
to make the army no longer necessary. 

I have filled up the office of quartermaster-general, 
which the Congress was pleased to leave to me, by the 
appointment of Major Mifflin, which I hope and believe 
will be universally acceptable. 

It gives me great pain to be obliged to solicit the 
attention of the honorable Congress to the state of this 
army, in terms which imply the slightest apprehension 
of being neglected. But my situation is inexpressibly 
distressing, to see the winter fast approaching upon a 
naked army, the time of their service within a few 
weeks of expiring, and no provision yet made for such 
important events. Added to these, the military chest is 
totally exhausted ; the paymaster has not a single dollar 
in hand ; the commissary-general assures me he has 
strained his credit, for the subsistence of the army, to 
the utmost. The quartermaster-general is precisely 
in the same situation ; and the greater part of the troops 
are in a state not far from mutiny, upon the deduction 
from their stated allowance. I know not to whom I am 
to impute this failure ; but I am of opinion, if the evil 
is not immediately remedied, and more punctuality ob- 
served in future, the army must absolutely break up. I 
hoped I had so fully expressed myself on this subject, 
both by letter, and to those members of the Con- 
gress, who honored the camp with a visit, that no dis- 
appointment could possibly happen. I therefore hourly 
expected advice from the paymaster, that he had receiv- 
ed a fresh supply, in addition to the hundred and sev- 
enty-two thousand dollars delivered to him in August ; 
and thought myself warranted to assure the public 
creditors, that in a few days they should be satisfied. 
But the delay has brought matters to such a crisis, as 
admits of no farther uncertain expectation. I have 



PartIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 105 

therefore sent off this express with orders to make ail 
possible despatch. It is my most earnest request, that 
he may be returned with all possible expedition, unless 
the honorable Congress have already Ibrwarded what is 
so indispensably necessary. I have the honor to be. See. 



TO MAJOK CHRISTOPHER FRENCH.* 






Camp at Cambridge, 26 September, 1775. 

Sir, 

Your favor of the 18th instant is now before me, as : ^ ■ ^ 

well as that from the Committee of Hartford on the 
same subject. When I compare the treatment you 
have received with that, which has been shown to those 
brave American officers, who were taken fighting gallant- 
ly in defence of the liberties of their country, I cannot 
help expressing some surprise, that you should thus 
earnestly contest points of mere punctilio. The appel- 
lation of Rebel has been deemed sufficient to sanctify 
every species of cruelty to them ; while the ministerial 
officers, the voluntary instruments of an avaricious and 
vindictive ministry, claim, upon all occasions, the benefit 
of those military rules, which can only be binding where 
they are mutual. We have shown, on our part, the 
strongest disposition to observe them, during the 
present contest ; but I should ill support my country's 
honor, and my own character, if I did not show a 
proper sense of their sufTerings, by making the con- 
dition of the ministerial officers in some degree depen- 
dent upon theirs. H^/i ^, 22.", ila j 

My disposition does not allow me to follow the un- 7'^

extent. You possess all the essential comforts of life ; 
why should you press for indulgences of a ceremonious 
kind, which give general offence ? 

I have looked over all the papers sent me from Phila- 
delphia. I find nothing in them upon the present sub- 
ject, nor do I know whether the liberty of wearing your 
sword was given or taken. But I flatter myself, that, 
when you come to consider all circumstances, you will 
save me the trouble of giving any positive directions. 
A j\ 1 You will easily conceive how much more grateful a 

compliance with the wishes of the people, among 
whom your residence may be longer than you ex- 
pect, will appear, when it is the result of your prudence 
and good sense, rather than of a determination from 
me. I therefore should be unwilling to deprive you of 
an opportunity of cultivating their esteem by so small 
a concession as this must be. 

As I suppose your several letters to me have been 
communicated to others, I cannot forbear considering 
your conduct in "declaring, in a high tone, that, had you 
joined your regiment, you would have acted vigorously 
against this country, and done all in your power to re- 
duce it,"* as a deviation from the line of propriety and 
prudence, which I should have expected to disdnguish 
the conduct of so old and experienced an officer. Your

Mr. Paine," says he, " if I would not fight against the colonies if set at

that I would endeavour to reduce them, but I did not say so ; and I must 
appeal to you, Sir, if the question need or should have been asked. The 
answer was obvious, and therefore it could only be asked with a design to 
have something to say. I told them, therefore, that I gloried in serving 
my king and country, and should always do so, and I glory even in repeat- 
ing it to you. I am convinced. Sir, you will not tliink the worse of 
me for supporting my honor as a man, and a British officer, which, in all

being so entirely in our power may extinguish the re- 
sentment, which a generous and enlightened mind would 
otherwise feel ; but 1 cannot commend the conduct, 
which puts such a mind to the trial. 

I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant. 



TO THE COMMITTEE OF HARTFORD. 

Camp at Cambridge, 26 September, 1775. 

Gentlemen, ^ /S'2, ^ 

Your favor of the 18th instant, and one from Major 
French on the same subject, have come safely to hand. 
From the general character of this genUeman, and the 
acknowledged politeness and attention of the Com- 
mittee of Hartford to the gendemen intrusted to their 
care, I flattered myself, that there would be a mutual 
emulation of civility, which would have resulted in the 
ease and convenience of both. I am extremely sorry 
to find it otherwise ; and, upon a reperusal of former 
letters and papers, respecting these gendemen, I cannot 
think there is any thing particular in their situation, 
which can claim a distincdon. If the circumstance of 
wearing their swords had created no dissatisfaction, I 
should not have interfered, considering it, in itself, as a 
matter of indifference ; but, as it has become so, partly, 
perhaps, by the inadvertent expressions, which have 
dropped on this occasion, I persuade myself, that Major 
French, for the sake of his own convenience and ease, 
and to save me further trouble, will consider what is not 



situations, I am determined to do."— fFhere was a spice of impudence, as 
well as bmvado, in IV^ajor French's letters, but they evinced honorable 
feelings, snd were an^vered with respect apd kindness by Wasliington. 
The MajoB assumed it!as a title to consideration, and perhaps justly, that 
he was an bfflcer of tlirty-three years' servict. 



108 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 43. 

essential to either his comtbrt or happiness, except as 
mere opinion makes it so. 

On the other hand, allow me to recommend a gentle- 
ness, even to forbearance, with persons so entirely in 
our power. We know not what the chance of war may 
be ; but, let it be what it will, the duties of humanity 
and kindness will demand from us such a treatment, as 
we should expect from others, the case being reversed. 

I am, Gentlemen, &c. 



TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL JOSEPH SPENCER. 

Head-Quarters, 26 September, 1775. 

Sir, 

I have perused and considered a petition, or rather a 
remonstrance, directed to you and signed by several 
captains and subalterns, on the appointment of Mr. 
Huntington to the Ueutenancy of Captain Chester's 
company. 

The decent representation of officers, or even of 
common soldiers, through the channel of their Colonel, 
or other superior officers, I shall always encourage and 
attend to ; but I must declare my disapprobation of 
this mode of associating and combining, as subversive of 
all subordination, discipline, and order. 

Should the proper officers refuse or neglect to re- 
ceive their complaints, an immediate application to their 
general officer would be proper. Much as I disap- 
prove the mode of opposition to this gentleman, I dis- 
approve the opposition itself still more. To yield to it 
would be in effect to surrender the command of the 
army to those, whose duty it is, and whose honor it 
ought to be, to obey. Commissions should be ever the 
reward of merit, not of age, and I am determined never 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 109 

to put it out ot the proper power to reward a deserving, 
active officer, whatsoever may be his standing in the army, 
or the pretensions of those, who have no other merit 
than that of having been born or enhsted before him. 

In an army so young as ours, the claims arising from 
real service are very few, and the accidental circum- 
stance of obtaining a commission a month or two sooner 
can with no reasonable person claim any superior re- 
gard, or make such a scrutiny of any consequence. 
This army is supported by the whole continent ; the 
establishment is entirely new. All provincial customs, 
therefore, which are different in different provinces, 
must be laid out of the question. The power, which 
has established and which pays this army, has alone the 
right to judge, who shall command in it, from the gene- 
ral to the ensign. To put it into any other hands would 
be a high breach of my trust, and would give birth to 
such factions and cabals, as must soon end in the disso- 
lution of the army, and the ruin of our country. 

As no objections are made to Mr. Huntington's char- 
acter, nor any other reason assigned, than his not rising 
by gradation, I can make no alteration in his appoint- 
ment. At the same time I declare, that I shall upon all 
occasions pay a proper respect to long service, and as 
far as lies in my power give it all the preference, which 
is consistent with the welfare of the army and the du- 
ties of my station. I make no doubt, therefore, when 
these and all other officers (who, in such cases, are both 
parties and judges) divest themselves of prejudice and 
partiality, they will cheerfully acquiesce in such appoint- 
ments as are made, and manifest their sincere attach- 
ment to their country, and the great cause in which we 
are engaged, by a ready and hearty obedience to all 
orders and rules judged necessary for the general 
interest. T am. Sir, &.c.

rV\A^ (jUj,^ ^ ^ Camp at Cambridge, 30 September, 1775. 

Sir, 
. The Rev. Mr. Kirkland,* the bearer of this, having 
been introduced to the honorable Congress, can need 
no particular recommendation from me. But as he now 
wishes to have the affairs of his mission and public 
employ put upon some suitable footing, I cannot but inti- 
mate my sense of the importance of his station, and the 
great advantages which may result to the United Colo- 
nies, from his situation being made respectable. 

All accounts agree, that much of the favorable dispo- 
sition, shown by the Indians, may be ascribed to his la- 
bor and influence. He has accompanied a chief of the 
Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavoured to 
make agreeable to him, both by civility and some small 
presents. Mr. Kirkland being also in some necessity 
for money to bear his travelling charges and other ex- 
penses, I have supphed him with thirty-two pounds law- 
ful money. 

I cannot but congratulate the honorable Congress on 
the happy temper of the Canadians and Indians, our 
accounts of which are now fully confirmed by some 
intercepted letters from ofhcers in Canada to General 
Gage and others in Boston, which were found on board 
the vessel lately taken, going into Boston with a dona- 
tion of cattle and other fresh provisions for the ministe- 
rial army. I have the honor to be, &c.t

TO CAPTAIN DANIEL MORGAN. 

Camp at Cambridge, 4 October, 1775. 

Sir, 

I write to you in consequence of information I have re- 
ceived, that you and the captains of the rifle companies 
on the detachment against Quebec, claim an exemption 
from the command of all the field-officers, except 
Colonel Arnold. I understand this claim is founded 
upon some expressions of mine ; but, if you understood 
me in this way, you are much mistaken in my meaning. 
My intention is, and ever was, that every officer should 
command according to his rank. To do otherwise 
would subvert all military order and authority, which, I 
am sure, you could not wish or expect. 

Now the mistake is rectified, I trust you will exert 
yourself to support my intentions, ever remembering 
that by the same rule by which you claim an indepen- 
dent command, and break in upon military authority, 
others will do the same in regard to you, and, of conse- 
quence, the expedition must terminate in shame and 
disgrace to yourselves, and the reproach and detriment 
of your country. To a man of true spirit and military 
character, farther argument is unnecessary. I shall, 
therefore, recommend to you to preserve the utmost har- 



out emissaries to the Canadians and Indians, among whom they have been 
too successful. Many Indians have gone over to tliem, and large numbers 
of Canadians are with them at Chamblee. The people in general seem 
inclined that way, though the gentlemen, the clergy, and most of the 
bourgeois have manifested a fidelity to the King's service. Wo have suc- 
ceeded in raising only fourscore militia. 

" Thus we are on the very eve of being overrun and subdued. I had 
great hopes of holding out for this year, though I seem abandoned by all 
the earth, had the savages remained firm. I cannot blame these poor 
people for securing themselves, as tliey see multitudes of the enemy at 
hand, and no succour from any part, though it is now four months since 
their operations against us first began." — MS. Letter.

will much contribute ; and, wishing you health and suc-

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Camp at Cambridge, 4 October, 1775. 



Sir, 
Your favor of the 20th ultimo came safely to hand, and 
I should have despatched the express much sooner, but 
Colonel Arnold's expedition is so connected with your 
operations, that I thought it most proper to detain him, 
until I could give you the fullest account of his pro- 
gress. This morning the express, whom I sent to him, 
.d'0-p^iH'U c t<n f returned, and one of the enclosures is a copy of his

p^f^ out some time ago.f 

You will certainly hear from him soon, as I have 
given him the strongest injunctions on this head. I 
send you a copy of his instructions, and a Manifesto, of 
which I have furnished him a number to disperse 
throughout Canada. He is supplied with one thousand

they were not to be commanded by officers in the provincial ranks. 

f This party consisted of two persons, named Getchell and Berry, who 
set off from Fort Western, on the Kennebec, September 1st. They ad- 
vanced as far as the head-waters of the Dead River, where they met 
several Indians, who gave them such exaggerated accounts of the enemy 
on the Chaudiere, that they did not venture to proceed farther. Natanis, 
the last of the Norridgewocks, had a cabin in this quarter, and was in the 
interest of Governor Carleton. The intelligence brought back by these 
persons, in regard to the carrying-places and condition of the river, was 
of some service to Arnold.

pounds lawful money in specie, to answer his contingent 
charges. 

About eight days ago a brig from Quebec to Boston 
was taken and brought into Cape Ann. By some 
intercepted letters from Captain Gamble to General 
Gage and Major Sherill", the account of the temper of 
the Canadians in the American cause is fully confirmed. 
The Captain says, that if Quebec should be attacked 
before Carleton can throw himself into it, there will be 
a surrender without firing a shot. We most anxiously 
hope you will find sufiicient employ for Carleton at 
St. John's and its neighbourhood. 

We at last have the echo of Bunker's Hill from 
England. The number of killed and wounded by 
General Gage's account nearly corresponds with whaty/,^^^ .Kj-£-ii-i.L e^ 
we had ascertained. There does not seem the least ^ '.^^^.^^3^. 

probability of a change of measures or of ministers. T^i '

preparing for the winter, as there seems to be no proba- 
bility of an accommodation, or any such decision as to 
make the present army less necessary.* 

Lord Dartmouth had early suggested to General Gage the unportance ~ (\\--o\AiU\^ "i^-*- 



of taking possession of Rhode Island, as a means of keeping up a commu- 
nication between Boston and New York, and as a place easy to be de- 
fended, and one from which, in any exigency, succours might be derived. 
He had, also, expressed an opinion, that New York should be occupied. 
General Gage replied ; — "As the King's forces are too weak to act in 
more than one point, New York is the most eligible situation to hold. 
The friends of government could rally there, and, from every account, 
numbers would join them. That city could be easily defended, and sup- 
plied by a water communication. But there is much difficulty in leaving 
Boston. It requires secrecy and is of great detail. It is too important a 
step to be put in execution without knowing his Majesty's pleasure. 
Preparations will however be made for it, not knowing but instructions to

I also Mend you a copy of a letter written to Colonel 
Arnold to be communicated to the officers and soldiers. 
The information we have of your health gives us great 
concern, not only on your own account, but on that of 
the public service, which must suflfer in consequence.

possible success, honor, and safety, I am, dear Sir, &c. 

this effect may be given, in consequence of intimations in a former letter 
from me." — MS. Letter, August 20th. 

Lord Dartmouth wrote again on the 5th of September, before he could 
have received tlie above letter, and recommended to General Gage to 
abandon Boston, dismantle Castle William, and repair with the troops 
either to New York, or some other port to the southward, where the ships 
could lie in safety, and carry on operations securely during the winter. 
Many advantages, he thougJit, would result from such a change. This was 
answered by General Howe witli arguments similar to those already ad- 
vanced by General Gage, and his reasons for not complying with the 
recommendation of the minister were approved. 

Another plan in agitation was to divide the forces, and endeavour to 
hold New York and Boston at the same time. General Howe discouraged 
this scheme, as in his opinion impracticable ; and he said that Gage, Clin- 
ton, and Burgoyne agreed with him. Such a movement would require an 
additional force of not less than five thousand men to be left in Boston, 
and twelve thousand at New York, the latter to be employed in opening a 
communication with Canada, leaving five battalions for the defence of 
New York. Three tliousand regulars would then remain for Quebec, 
who, with three or four thousand Canadians, and some hundreds of In- 
dians, would compose the army of Canada ; but he could not say whether 
such a force would be sufiicient in that quarter. The primary object of a 
communication with Canada by the Hudson being thus accomplislied, and 
secured by posts, troops might take separate routes into Massachusetts 
and other parts of New England, as circumstances should point out. 

It was the opinion of General Howe, at the same time, that Boston 
should be evacuated, and the force designed for that place removed to 
Rhode Island. The project of penetrating'the country could more easily 
be executed from that point than from Boston, where little else could be 
done than to defend the post. The possession of Rhode Island would, 
moreover, put Connecticut in jeopardy, and induce that colony to keep its 
army at home for self-defence. Boston harbour might be blockaded after 
the evacuation by a small naval force, aided by a land party intrenched in 
the neighbourhood of Nantasket Roail. — MS. Letter to Lord Dart- 
mouth, October 0th.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. o^ ■ ■ 

Camp at Cambridge, 5 October, 1775. 

Sir, 

I was honored with your favor of the 26th uUimo, 
late the night before last ; and a meeting of the gene- 
ral officers having been called upon a business, which 
will make a considerable part of this letter, I took 
the opportunity of laying before them those parts 
of yours, which respect the continuance and new- 
modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other 
preparations for the ensuing winter. They ha^•e taken 
two or three days to consider ; and, as soon as I am 
possessed of their opinions, I shall lose no time in trans- 
mitting the result, not only on the above subjects, but 
the number of troops necessary to be kept up. 

I have also directed the commissary-general and the 
quartermaster-general to prepare estimates of the ex- 
pense of their departments for a certain given number 
of men, from which a judgment may be made, when 
the number of men to be kept in pay is determined ; 
all which I shall do myself the honor to lay before the 
Congress, as soon as they are ready. 

I have now a painful though a necessary duty to per- 
form, respecdng Dr. Church, director-general of the q i^ j. 
hospital. About a week ago, Mr, Secretary Ward of •^^^- 
Providence sent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant ^ c "^ x \ i ^ 3 7 / 
of Newport, with a letter directed to Major Cane in 
Boston, in characters ; which he said had been left with 
Wainwood some time ago, by a woman who was kept 
by Dr. Church. She had before pressed Wainwood to 
take her to Captain Wallace,* Mr. Dudley the collector, 
or George Rome, which he declined. She then gave 
him a letter, with a strict charge to deliver it to either

116 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

of those gentlemen. He, suspecting some improper 
correspondence, kept the letter, and alter some time 
opened it ; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where 
it remained until he received an obscure letter from the 
woman, expressing an anxiety after the original letter. 
He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, 
who sent him up with the papers to me. I immediate- 
ly secured the woman ; but for a long time she was 
proof against every threat and persuasion to discover 
the author. However, at length she was brought to a 
confession, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately 
secured him and all his papers. Upon his first exami- 
nation, he readily acknowledged the letter, said it was 
designed for his brother Fleming, and, when decipher- 
ed, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He 
acknowledged his never having communicated the cor- 
respondence to any person here but the girl, and made 
many protestations of the purity of his intentions, 
Hm,-- Ia/M^ Having found a person capable of deciphering the letter, 
- ,' I in the mean time had all his papers searched, but 

found nothing criminal among them. But it appeared, 
on inquiry, that a confidant had been among the papers 
before my messenger arrived. I then called the gene- 
ral officers together for their advice, the result of which 
you will find enclosed. The deciphered letter is also 
enclosed. The army and country are exceedingly irri- 
tated ; and, upon a free discussion of the nature, cir- 
cumstances, and consequence of this matter, it has been 
unanimously agreed to lay it before the honorable Con- 
gress for their special advice and direction ; at the same 
time sugaiestina; to their consideration, whether an 
alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not 
be necessary.*

As I shall reserve all farther remarks upon the state 
of the army till my next, I shall now beg leave to re- 
quest the determination of Congress, as to the property 
and disposal of such vessels and cargoes, as are designed 
for tlie supply of the enemy, and may fall into our 
hands. There has been an event of this kind at Ports- 
mouth, in which I have directed the cargo to be brought 
hither for the use of the army, reserving the settlement 
of any claims of capture to the decision of Congress. 

As there are many unfortunate individuals, whose 
property has been confiscated by the enemy, I Avould 
humbly suggest to the consideration of Congress the 
humanity of applying, in part or in the whole, such cap- 
lures to the relief of those sufferers, after compensating 
the captors for any expense, and for their acdvity and 
spirit. I am the more induced to request, that this de- 
termination may be speedy, as I have directed three ves- 
sels to be equipped in order to cut off the supplies ; and, 
from the number of vessels hourly arriving, it may be- 
come an object of some importance. In the disposal 
of these captures, for the encouragement of the officers 
and men, I have allowed them one third of the cargoes, 
except miUtary stores, which, with the vessels, are to 
be reserved for the public use. I hope my plan, as well 
as the execution, will be favored with the approbation 
of Congress. 

One Mr. Fisk, an intelligent person, came out of 
Boston on the 3d instant, and gives us the following 
advices ; that a fleet, consisting of a sixty-four, and a 
twenty-gun ship, two sloops of eighteen guns, and two 
transports with six hundred men, were to sail from 
Boston yesterday ; that they took on board two mor-

tars, four howitzers, and other artillery calculated for 
the bombardment of a town ; their destination was kept 
a profound secret ; that an express sloop of wai', which 
left England the 8th of August, arrived four days ago ; 
that General Gage is recalled, and last Sunday resigned 
his command to General Howe ; that Lord Percy, 
Colonel Smith, and other officers, who were at Lexing- 
ton, are ordered home with Gage ; that six ships of the 
hne and two cutters were coming out under Sir Peter 
Dennis ; that five regiments and a thousand marines are 
ordered out, and may be expected in three or four 
weeks ; no prospect of an accommodation, but the 
ministry determined to push the war to the utmost.* 

I have an express from Colonel Arnold, and herewith 
send a copy of his letter and an enclosure. I am hap- 
py in finding he meets with no discouragement. The 
claim of the rifle officers to be independent of all the 
superior officers, except Colonel Arnold, is without any 
countenance or authority from me, as I have signified in 
my last despatch, both to Colonel Arnold and Captain 
Morgan. The captain of the brig from Quebec for 
Boston informs me, that there is no suspicion of any 
such expedition ; and that, if Carleton is not driven 
from St. John's, so as to be obliged to throw himself 
into Quebec, it must fall into our hands, as it is left 
without a regular soldier, and many of the inhabitants 
are most favorably disposed to the American cause; 
and that there is the largest stock of ammunition ever 
collected in America. 

In the above vessel some lettei*s were also found, 
from an officer at Quebec to General Gage and Major 
Sheriff at Boston, containing such an account of the

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. - 

Camp at Cambridge, 5 October, 1775. 

Dear Sir, j <yi/u>9 t. J 

I wrote to you yesterday, since which I have been in- 
formed, that your illness has obliged you to quit the 
army, and General Wooster as the eldest Brigadier will 
take rank and command of Mr. Montgomery. General 
Wooster, I am informed, is not of such activity as to 
press through difficulties, with which that service is en- 
vironed. I am therefore much alarmed for Arnold, 
whose expedition was built upon yours, and who will 
infallibly perish, if the invasion and entry into Canada 
are abandoned by your successor, f 



* General Gage wrote to Lord Dartmouth, on the 20th of August, that 
General Carleton did not find the Canadians so ready for war as he had 
hoped, and that some of the Indian tribes were backward. He said the 
minds of the Canadians had been poisoned by the enemy, but that a good 
force there would set them all in motion. He advised, that General 
Carleton should be reinforced witli four thousand men, a supply of arms, 
military stores, and Indian goods. — MS. Letter. 

f General Wooster was now advanced in life. He had served in the 
two preceding wars, having been present at the capture of Louisburg in 
1745, and commanded a Connecticut regiment nearly the whole of the 
last French war. When the Connecticut troops were raised, in 1775, he 
was appointed to the command of the whole. The continental appoint- 
ment, therefore, by which lie was placed the third on the list of briga- 
diers, and Putnam raised over liim to the rank of major-general, was by 
no means satisfactory. Yet he accepted the commission in a spirit, which 
reflected much credit upon his character. 

When he went to the northward. General Washington had the impres- 
sion, that he would assume the command in Canada, as higher in rank than 
Montgomery. But the fact was, he stood one degree lower, so that this 
difficulty was obviated. To prevent all chance of dispute, General Schuy- 
ler resolved to keep Wooster at Ticonderoga, and send forward Ms regi- 



120 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

I hope by this time the penetration into Canada by 
your army is effected ; but if it is not, and there are 
any intentions to lay it aside, I beg it may be done in 
such a manner, that Arnold may be saved by giving him 
notice, and in the mean time your army may keep up 
such appearances as to fix Carleton, and prevent the 
force of Canada being turned wholly upon Arnold. He 
expected to be at Quebec in twenty days from the 
26th of September, so that I hope you will have no 
difficulty in regulating your motions with respect to 
him. Should this find you at Albany, and General 
Wooster about taking the command, I intreat you 
to impress him strongly with ihe importance and 
necessity of proceeding, or so to conduct, that Arnold 
may have time to retreat. 



ment. But the officers and men, ivho sympathized with their commander 
in his complaint of injustice, would not go without him. They had al- 
ready refused to sign the articles of war, sent out by the Continental Con- 
gress, and their general was obliged to govern them by the military laws 
of Connecticut. This aspect of things gave some concern to General 
Schuyler, when the regiment arrived at Ticonderoga, and he wrote to 
General Wooster requesting to know precisely on what ground he con- 
sidered himself to stand. The reply was that of an honorable and gene- 
rous soldier, as well as a true patriot. 

" My appointment in the Continental Army," said General Wooster, 
" you are sensible could not be very agreeable to me ; notwithstanding 
which, I never should have continued in the service, had I not determined 
to observe the rules of the army. No, Sir ; I have the cause of my coun- 
try too much at heart, to attempt to make any difficulty or uneasiness in 
the army, upon whom the success of an enterprise of almost infinite im- 
portance to the country is now depending. I shall consider my rank in 
the army what my commission from the Continental Congress makes it, 
and shall not attempt to dispute the command with General Montgomery 
at St. John's. You may depend. Sir, that I shall exert myself as much 
as possible to promote the strictest union and harmony among both officers 
and soldiers, and use every means in my power to give success to the 
expedition." 

He went forward with his regiment into Canada, put himself under 
General Montgomery, and verified this declaration by his conduct, which 
was not marked, however, with much enterprise or efficiency.

TO ROBERT CARTER NICHOLAS, VIRGINIA. 

Camp at Cambridge, 5 October, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 8th ultimo came to my hands on 
the 2d instant by Mr. Byrd. I return you my sincere 
thanks for your kind congratulation on my appointment 
to the honorable and important post I now hold, by the 
suffrages of this great continenL My heart will ever 
bear testimony of my gradtude for the distinguished 
mark of honor, which has been conferred on me by this 
appointment ; as it also will of my wishes, that so im- 
portant a trust had been placed in the hands of a per- 
son of greater experience and abiUties than mine. I 
feel the weight of my charge too sensibly not to make 
this declaration. At the same time, I must add, that I 
do not wish to withdraw any services, within the com- 
pass of my power, from the cause we are nobly en- 
gaged in. 

Mr. Byrd shall not want for his pay, whilst he is in 
this camp ; although, as I have no cash of my own here, 
and charge the public with my expenses only, I shall be 
a little at a loss to know in what manner to advance it 
with propriety. Bills of exchange would answer no end 
here, as we have not the means of negotiating them ; 
but, if you would place the money in the hands of 
Messrs. Willing and Morris of Philadelphia, either in 
specie, continental, Maryland, or Pennsylvania paper,

122 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [/Ex. 43. 

they could easily remit or draw for it. But, at any rate, 
make yourself easy, as Mr. Byrd shall not want the 
amount of his pay. 

The enemy in Boston and on the heights at Charles- 
town (two peninsulas surrounded in a manner by sliips 
of war and floating batteries) are so strongly fortified, 
as to render it almost impossible to force their lines, 
thrown up at the head of each neck. Without great 
slaughter on our side, or cowardice on theirs, it is abso- 
lutely so. We therefore can do no more, than keep 
them besieged, which they are, to all intents and pur- 
poses, as closely as any troops on earth can be, who 
have an opening to the sea. Our advanced works and 
theirs ai'e within musket-shot. We daily undergo a 
cannonade, which has done no injury to our works, and 
very litde hurt to our men. These insults we are com- 
pelled to submit to for want of powder, being obliged, 
except now and then giving them a shot, to reserve 
what we have for closer work than cannon-distance. 

My respectful compliments to Mrs. Nicholas and the 
rest of your fireside, and to any inquiring friends. With 
grateful thanks for the prayers and good wishes you are

Previous to the direction of Congress to consult the 



Part [1.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 123 

general officers on the best mode of continuing and 
providing for tlie army during the winter, I had desired 
them to turn their thouglits upon these subjects, and to 
favor me with the result, by a particular day, in writing. ^^ j ^^^ i/-c<./*tr.-, 
In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Franklin, Mr. ^^ ^^ 
Lynch, and Colonel Harrison, was communicated, an 
event which has given me the highest satisfaction, as 
the subject was too weighty and complex for a discus- 
sion by letter. This appointment made any conclusion 
here unnecessary, as it is not probable any such arrange- 
ment would be agreed on, as would not be altered in 
some respects, upon a full and free conference. This 
good effect will arise from the step already taken, that 
every officer will be prepared to give his sentiments 
upon these important subjects.* 

* By the resolution of Congress appointing the committee, they were (j/n/Vt/VW^vW*- ^^ 

to confer with General Washington, and the respective governments of ■, , ^^ ^^ CcuVIa- 
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, on tlio 
most effectual method of continuing, supporting, and regulating a Con- 
tinental army. The committee were likewise furnished witli detailed in- 
structions. 

The members of the committee, and delegates from tlie four colonies 
above mentioned, met in convention at Cambridge on the 18th of October, 
and continued their sittings daily till the 92d. The persons present, be- 
sides the committee, were Griswold and Wales from Connecticut ; Gover- 
nor Cooke from Rhode Island ; Bowdoin, Otis, Sever, and Spooner from 
Massachusetts ; Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire. General 
Washington was president of the board. 

In a council of war, which had been assembled but a short time before, 
several of the points, put in charge of the committee by Congress, liad 
been considered, and the opinions of the officers upon them expressed. 
These were generally confirmed and adopted by the delegates in confer- 
ence. The mode of raising, arranging, clothing, and supplying a new 
army was determined. While the enemy remained in the same strength 
at Boston, it was unanimously agreed, that the American army ought not 
to consist of less than twenty thousand three hundred and seventy-two 
men, making twenty-six regiments, exclusive of riflemen and artillery, 
each regiment to be divided into eight companies. Efforts were to be 
made to reenlist as many soldiers as possible among those already on the 
ground, and the vacancies were to be filled up by new levies. The de.e- 
gates of the four colonies were respectively of opinion, that twenty thou-

The estimates of the commissary and quartermaster 
general I have now the honor of enclosing. 

With respect to the reduction of the pay of the men, 
which may enter into the consideration of their support, 
it is the unanimous opinion of the general officers, that 
it cannot be touched with safety at present. 

Before I Avas honored with your favor of the 5th in- 
stant, I had given orders for the equipment of some 
armed vessels, to intercept the enemy's supplies of pro- 
visions and ammunition. One of them was on a cruise 
between Cape Ann and Cape Cod, when the express 
arrived. The others will be fit for the sea in a few days, 
under the command of officers of the Continental army, 
who are well recommended, as persons acquainted with 
the sea, and capable of such a service. Two of these 
will be immediately despatched on this duty, and every 
particular, mentioned in your favor of the 5th instant, 
literally complied with.* 

sand men might be raised in Massachusetts, eight thousand in Connecti- 
cut, tliree thousand in New Hampshire, and fifteen hundred in Rhode 
Island, if the pay remained the same as heretofore, and the time of service 
one year." — Minvtes of the Conference. 

After settling what pertained to the army, the conference broke up, but 
the committee from Congress remained two or three days longer, and took 
many other topics into consideration, which had been suggested in Gene- 
ral Washington's letters to Congress. The articles of war were revised, 
and changes recommended to Congress. Regulations for disposing of 
prizes and provisions captured at sea, exchange of prisoners, employment 
of Indians, local details in regard to the army, and many other particulars, 
were discussed, and certain definite principles or rules established. The 
conference was of great moment to General Washington, since the com- 
mittee and the delegates from the colonies would be boimd to sustain the 
measures there agreed upon. The affairs of the army were brought into 
a more systematic train, and the Commander-in-chief could act with more 
precision and confidence. The doings of the committee were confirmed by 
Congress, in a series of resolves after their return. 

* In the letter here mentioned, President Hancock had written, that 
intelligence had just been received by Congress of the sailing of two 
brigantines from England on the 11th of August, bound for Quebec, laden 
with powder and other stores, without convoy and of no force. Further- 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 125 

That the honorable Congress may have a more com- 
plete idea of the plan on wliich these vessels are 
equipped, I enclose a copy of the instructions given to 
the captains now out. These, -with the additional in- .^ . , 

structions directed, will be given to the captains, who ., w *^ 
go into the mouth ot St. Lawrence's River. As both 
officers and men most cheerfully engage in the service, ' '--e* ^/f ' 6" 
on the terms mentioned in these instructions, I fear ,,,,.. /otJ". 
that the proposed increase will create some difficulty, 
by making a difference among men engaged on similar 
service. I have therefore not yet communicated this 
part of the plan, but reserved an extra bounty as a re- 
ward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed 
vessels in this province ; and Governor Cooke informs 
me, that the enterprise can receive no assistance from 
him, as one of the armed vessels of Rhode Island is on 
a long cruise, and the other unfit for the service. Noth- 
ing shall be omitted to secure success. A fortunate 
capture of an ordnance ship would give new life to the 
camp, and an immediate turn to the issue of this cam- 
paign. * 

Our last accounts from Colonel Arnold are very favo- 
rable. He was proceeding with all expedition ; and I 
flatter myself, making all allowances, that he will be at 
Quebec the 20th instant, where a gentleman from Cana- 
da, Mr. Price, assures me he will meet with no resist- 
ance, t From the various accounts received from Europe, 

more the letter conveyed the instructions of Congress to Washington, 
that he should with all possible despatch fit out two armed vessels, at the 
Continental expense, to sail for the St. Lawrence, with the view of inter- 
cepting these brigantines. He was directed to procure the vessels from 

the government of Massachusetts ; but, as there were no armed vessels r\ n * /O i. fi 
belonging to that province, he equipped and sent oft" two of those, which '''•v- ''^^ l-MWr 14'V>

there may be reason to expect troops will be landed at 
New York, or some other middle colony. I should be 
glad to know the pleasure of the Congress, whether, 
upon such an event, it would be expected that a part of 
this army should be detached, or the internal force of 
such colony and its neighbourhood be deemed suffi- 
cient ; or whether, in such case, I am to wait the 
particular direction of Congress. 

The fleet, mentioned in my last, has been seen stand- 
ing to the north-east ; so that we apprehend it is in- 
tended for some part of this province, or New Hamp- 
shire, or possibly Quebec. 

The latest and best accounts we have from the ene- 
my are, that they are engaged in their new work across 
the south end of Boston, and preparing their barracks for 
winter ; that it is proposed to keep from five hundred to 
a thousand men on Bunker's Hill all winter, who are to 
be reheved once a week ; the rest to be draw n into Bos- 
L-aiv O cuTtx-i-y ton. A person, who has lately been a servant to Major 
-^ (r^"^ Connolly, a tool of Lord Dunmore's, has given an ac- 

"^ count of a scheme to distress the southern provinces, 

which appeared to me of sufficient consequence to be 
immediately transmitted. I have therefore got it at- 
tested, and do myself the honor of enclosing it. 

The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched 
into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we 
have ; so that we have now the same strength, as be- 
fore the detachment made under Colonel Arnold. I 
am, &.C. 

and intelligent, and so warm a friend to the measures adopted by Con- 
gress, that I wish to have him mentioned in the strongest terms to Con-

Canada the spring following.

TO JOHX AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. Q 

Camp at Cambridge, 13 October, 1775. 

Dear Brothek, 

- Your favor of the 12th ultimo came to hand a few 
days ago. By it I gladly learned, that your family were 
recovered of the two complaints, which had seized 
many of them and confined my sister. 1 am very glad 
to hear, also, that the Convention had come to resolu- 
tions of arming the people, and preparing vigorously for 
the defence of the colony ; which, by the latest accounts 
from England, will prove a salutary measure. I am also 
pleased to find, that the manufacture of arms and 
ammunition has been attended to with so much care. 
A plenty of these, and unanimity and fortitude among 
ourselves, must defeat every attempt, that the ministry 
can invent to enslave this great continent. In the 
manufacturing of arras for public use, great care should 
be taken to make the bores of the same size, that the 
same balls may answer, otherwise great disadvantages 
may arise from a mixture of cartridges. 

The enemy, by their not coming out, are, I suppose, 
afraid of us ; whilst their situation renders any attempts 
of ours upon them in a manner impracticable. * Noth- 

" On tlie 18th of October, the officers were convened a second time to 
hold a council respecting an attack on Boston. There was a unanimous 
voice against it. 

It is a little remarkable, that each party had conclusive reasons for 
avoiding to attack the other. " It is inadvisable ," said General Gage in 
a letter to Lord Dartmouth, "to attempt penetrating the country from 
Boston. Tlie enemy's forces are numerous, and such an attempt must be 
made under very great disadvantages ; and even if successful, little would 
be gained by it, as neither horses, carriages, nor other means for moving 
forward could be procured. Our force is too small to be divided into de- 
tachments for this purpose, and success would answer no other end than 
to drive the rebels out of one strong-hold into another." — Jl/S. Letter, 
August Wth. General Howe used the same arguments on the 9th of 
October. 



128 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 4S. 

ing new has happened, since my last, worth communi- 
cating. Since finishing our own lines of defence, we, 
as well as the enemy, have been busily employed in 
putting our men under proper cover for the winter. 
Our advanced works, and theirs, are within musket-shot 
of each other. We are obliged to submit to an almost 
daily cannonade without returning a shot, from our 
scarcity of powder, which we are necessitated to keep 
for closer work than cannon-distance, whenever the red- 
coat gentry please to step out of their intrenchments. 
Seeing no prospect of this, I sent a detachment, about 
a month ago, into Canada, by the way of Kennebec 
River, under the command of a Colonel Arnold. This 
detachment consisted of one thousand men, and was 
ordered to take possession of Quebec if possible ; but, 
at any rate, to make a diversion in favor of General 
Schuyler, who by this time is in possession, I trust, 
of Montreal and St. John's, as I am not altogether 
without hopes that Colonel Arnold may be of the capi- 
tal. Finding that we were in no danger of a visit from 
our neighbours, I have fitted out and am fitting out 
several privateers with soldiers, who have been bred to 
the sea, and I have no doubt of making captures of 
several of their transports, some of which have already 
fallen into our hands, laden with provisions, 

I am obliged to you for your advice to my wife, and 
for your intention of visiting her. Seeing no great pros- 
pect of returning to my family and friends this winter, 
I have sent an invitation to Mrs. Washington to come 
to me, although I fear the season is too far advanced 
to admit this with any tolerable degree of convenience, 
especially if she should, when my letters get home, be 
in New Kent, as I believe the case will be. I have 
laid before her a state of the difficulties, however, which 
must attend the journey, and left it to her own choice.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. > . ■ ,' 

Camp at Cambridge, 24 October, 1775. / 

Sir, :-- / ■i'^^ 

My conjecture of the destination of the late squad- 
f^A) ron from Boston, in my last, has been unhappily veri- 
fied by an outrage, exceeding in barbarity and cruelty 
every hostile act practised among civilized nations. I 
have enclosed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a 
gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the destruction 
of that increasing and flourishing village. He is a very '^**" *^^ «../**v9 
great sufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for -'*^. 
the removal of effects was so small, that valuable 
property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been 
destroyed. The orders shown by the captain for this 
horrid procedure, by which it appears the same deso- 
lation is meditated upon all the towns on the coast, 
made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and ex- 
tensively as possible. As Portsmouth was the next 
place to which he proposed to go, General Sullivan Avas 
permitted to go up, and give them his assistance and 
advice to ward off the blow. I flatter myself the like 
event will not happen there, as they have a fortification 
of some strength, and a vessel has arrived at a place 
called Sheepscot, with fifteen hundred pounds of 
powder. 

The gentlemen of the Congress have nearly finished 
their business ; but, as they write by this opportunity, I 
must beg leave to refer you to their letter, for what con- 
cerns their commission.

TO THE COMMITTEE OF FALMOUTH, CASCO BAY. 

Camp at Cambridge, 24 October, 1775. 

Gentlemen, 

The desolation and misery, which ministerial ven- 
geance had planned,! in contempt of every principle of 
humanity, and so lately brought on the town of Fal- 
mouth, I know not how sufficiently to commiserate. 
Nor can my compassion for the general suffering be 
conceived beyond the true measure of my feelings. 
But my readiness to relieve you, by complying with 
your request, signified in your favor of the 21st instant, 
is circumscribed by my inability. The immediate ne- 
cessities of the army under my command require all 
the powder and ball, that can be collected with the ut- 
most industry and trouble. The authority of my sta- 
tion does not extend so far, as to empower me to send 
a detachment of men down to your assistance. Thus 
circumstanced, I can only add ray wishes and ex- 
hortations, that you may repel every future attempt to 
perpetrate the like savage cruelties. 

* A detailed account of the burning of Falmouth by Lieutenant 
Mowat, may be found in Williamson^s History of Maine, Vol. 11. pp. 422, 
4.34. — See Appendix, No. XI. 

f This expression was founded on Mowat's declaration to the Commit- 
tee of Falmouth, that orders had been given for burning seaport towns. 
That the declaration was not true, in regard to the ministry, is sliown in 
the Appendix. The public at that day was much deceived on tliis subject, 
and historians have pprpetUiited the error.

TO MAJOR CHRISTOPHER FRENCH.* 

Head-Q,uarters, Cambridge, 25 October, 1775. 

Sir, 

I now sit down to give a final answ^er to your applica- 
tion respecting your sword. Dr. Franklin confirms, 
what I before mentioned, that the privilege claimed was 
no part of the stipulation made at Philadelphia, as it 
was not discussed. 

Having made inquiry, I find the rule with regard to 
the indulgence in question is, that prisoners do not wear 
their swords. I therefore cannot approve of it, more 
especially as it gives such general dissatisfaction to the 
good people of the country. 

To your other request of removing to some place, 
where you can have the benefit of attending public 
worship in the church of England, I have not the least 
objection, provided the place is approved by Governor 
Trumbull, to whom, in this case, you will be pleased to 
apply. I wish you all the happiness consistent with your 
situation ; and while the inhabitants of America treat 
you with humanity and kindness, I trust you will make 
a suitable return. It is not grateful to me to hear the 
respectable citizens of any town treated with incivility 
or contempt. I am. Sir, your very humble servant.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER.

Dear Sir, 

Your several favors of the 12th and 14th instant 
came safe to hand, though not in the proper order of 
time, with their several enclosures. You do me justice 
in believing, that I feel the utmost anxiety for your 
situation, that I sympathize with you in all your dis- 
tresses, and shall most heartily share in the joy of your 
success.* My anxiety extends itself to poor Arnold, 
W'hose fate depends upon the issue of your campaign. 
Besides your other difficulties, I fear you have those 
of the season added, which will increase every day. 
In the article of powder, we are in danger of suffering 
equally Avith you. Our distresses on this head are mu- 
tual ; but I hope they are short-lived, as every measure 
of relief has been pursued, which human invention could 
suggest. 

When you write to General Montgomery, be pleased 
to convey my best wishes and regards to him.f It has

should prevent me from reaping those laurels for which I have unwearied- 
ly wrought since I was honored with tliis command ; the anxiety I have 
suffered since my arrival here, lest the army should starve, occasioned by 
a scandalous want of subordination and inattention to ray orders in some 
of the officers, that I left to command at the different posts ; the vast 
variety of vexations and disagreeable incidents, that almost every hour 
arise in some department or other ; not only retard my cure, but have put 
me considerably back for some days past. If Job had been a general in 
my situation, his memory had not been so famous for patience. But the 
glorious end we have in view, and which I have a confident hope will 
be attained, will atone for all."

when I was informed by Major Brown, that a general dissatisfaction pre-

been equally unfortunate for our country and yourself, 
that your ill health has deprived the active part of your 
army of your presence. God Almighty restore you, 
and crown you with happiness and success. 

Colonel Allen's misfortune will, I hope, teach a lesson 
of prudence and subordination to others, who may be 
too ambitious to outshine their general officers, and, re- 
gardless of order and duty, rush into enterprises, which 
have unfavorable effects on the public, and are destruc- 
tive to themselves. * 

Dr. Franklin, Mr. Lynch, and Colonel Harrison, dele- 
gates from the Congress, have been in the camp for 
several days, in order to settle the plan for continuing 
and supporting the army.f This commission extended 

vailed ; that unless sometliing was undertaken in a few days, there would 
be a imutinyj and that the universal sense of the army was to direct all 
our attention to the east side. The impatience of the troops to get home 
has prevented their seeing the impossibility of undertaking this business 
sooner, tlie duty being hard for the troops in the present confined state 
of operations. 

" When I mentioned my intentions, I did not consider tiact I was at the 
head of troops, who carry the spirit of freedom into the field, and think 
for themselves. Upon considering tlie fatal consequences, which might 
flow from a want of subordination and discipline, should this ill-humor 
continue, my unstable authority over troops of different colonies, tlie in- 
sufficiency of the military law, and my own want of power^ to enforce it, 
weak as it is, I thought it expedient to call the field-officers together. 
Enclosed I send you the result of our deliberations. •• ^ ^ 

" I cannot help observing to how little purpose I am here. Were I not 
afraid the e.xample would be too generally followed, and tiiat the public 
service might suffer, I would not stay an hour at the head of troops, whose 
operations I cannot direct. I must say I have no hope^^ of success,(unle3)j 
from the garrison's wanting provision." ^ S / 

* Ethan Allen crossed the St. Lawrence with a small party below 
Montreal, where he was defeated and taken prisoner, after maintaining 
for some time, and with great courage, a very unequal conflict. He was 
put in irons and sent to Quebec, and thence to England. After being a 
prisoner for nearly three years, transported from place to place, he was 
e.xchanged. He published, in 1779, a jVarrative of the events of his cap- 
ture and imprisoimient.

to your department ; but, upon consideration, it appeared 
so difTicult to form any rational plan, that nothing was 
done in that respect. If your time and health will ad- 
mit, I should think it highly proper to turn your 
thoughts to this subject, and communicate the result to 
the Congress as early as possible. We have had no 
event of any consequence in our camp for some time, 
our whole attention being taken up with preparations for 
the winter, and forming the new army, in which many 
difficulties occur. The enemy expect a considerable 
reinforcement this winter, and from all accounts are 
garrisoning Gibraltar and other places with foreign 
troops, in order to bring the former garrison to America. 
The ministry have begun the destruction of our sea- 
port towns, by burning a flourishing town of about three 
hundred houses to the eastward, called Falmouth. This 
they effected with every circumstance of cruelty and 
barbarity, which revenge and malice could suggest. 
We expect every moment to hear other places have 
been attempted, which are better prepared for their 
reception. 

The more I reflect upon the importance of your ex- 
pedition, the greater is my concern, lest it should sink 
under insuperable difficulties. I look upon the interests 
and salvation of our bleeding country in a great degree 
as depending upon your success. I know you feel its 
importance, as connected not only with your own honor 
and happiness, but the public welfare ; so that you can 
want no incitements to press on, if it be possible. My 
anxiety suggests some doubts, which your better ac-

Would it not have been practicable to pass St. John's, 
leaving force enough for a blockade ; or, if you could 
not spare the men, passing it wholly, possessing your- 
selves of Montreal, and the surrounding country? 
Would not St. John's have fallen of course, or what 
would have been the probable consequence? Believe 
me, dear General, I do not mean to imply the smallest 
doubt of the propriety of your operations, or of those

I too well know the absurdity of judging upon a military 
operation, when you are without the knowledge of its 
concomitant circumstances. I only mean it as a matter 
of curiosity, and to suggest to you my imperfect idea on 
the subject. I am, with the utmost truth and regard, 
dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

Dear Sir, 
As you will be fully informed of every matter and 
thing relative to the army, by your own committee, I 
should not have given you the trouble of a letter at this 
time, were it not on Colonel Reed's account. * He is, 
as I presume you may have heard, concerned in many 
of the principal causes now depending in the courts of 
Pennsylvania ; and should those causes be pressed for 
trial by his brethren of the profession, it will not only do 
him a manifest injury in his practice and future pros- 
pects, but afford room for complaint of his having neg- 

* Colonel Joseph Reed was secretary to General Washington. He 
left the camp for Philadelphia, on the 30th of October, and was absent till 
after the removal of the army to New York. During this period a con- 
stant and confidential correspondence was kept up between him and the 
Commander-in-chief. Robert Hanson Harrison, of Alexandria, a lawyer 
by profession, with whom Washington had been much acquainted, and 
who had been invited by him to become one of his aids, arrived in Cam- 
bridge shortly after the departure of Colonel Reed. He was immediately 
announced in the public orders as an aid to the Commander-in-chief He 
^^ . i^ ' ' received a colonel's commission, and served as secretary to the General

of Washington more entirely than Colonel Harrison, and to few was he

be avoided, if some of you gendemen of the Congress, 
in the course of conversation with the chief-justice and 
others, would represent the disadvantages, which must 
result to him, in case his causes should be hurried to 
trial. 

That Colonel Reed is clever in his business and use- 
ful to me, is too apparent to mention. I should do equal 
injustice, therefore, to his abilities and merit, were I not 
to add, that his services here are too important to be 
lost, and that I could wish to have him considered in 
this point of view by your honorable body, when occa- 
sion shall favor. 

I shall take it kind of you to give me, from time to 
time, such authentic intelligence of the manoeuvres of 
the ministry, as you think may be relied on. We get 
none but newspaper accounts here, and these very im- 
perfect. I am, with sincere esteem and regard, deai- 
Sir, your affectionate friend and countryman. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp at Cambridge, 30 October, 1775. 

Sir, 

The information, which the gentlemen who have 
(/i/-^' lately gone from hence can give the Congress, of the 
state and situation of the army, would have made a let- 
ter unnecessary, if I did not suppose there would be '•t /t4J\' 
some anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the 'Z , ' 
subject of the reenlistment. 

Agreeably to the advice of those gentlemen, and my 
own opinion, I immediately began by directing all such 
officers, as proposed to continue, to signify their inten- 
tions as soon as possible. A great number of the re-

turns are come in, from which I find, that a very great 
proportion of ihe officers of the rank of captain, and 
under, will retire ; from present appearances I may say 
half; but at least one third. It is with some concern 
also that I observe, that many of the officers, who retire, 
discourage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will 
communicate the infection to them. Some have ad- 
vised, that those officers, who decline the service, should 
be immediately dismissed ; but this would be very dan- 
gerous and inconvenient. I confess I have great anxie- 
ties upon the subject, though I still hope the pay and 
terms are so advantageous, that interest, and I trust 
also a regard to their country, will retain a greater pro- 
portion of the privates than of their officers. In so im- 
portant a matter, I shall esteem it my indispensable 
duty, not only to act with all possible prudence, but to 
give the most early and constant advice of my progress. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 
I have been honored with your favor of the 30th ul- 
timo by Mr. Trumbull. I sincerely wish this camp 
could furnish a good engineer. The Commissary-general 
can inform you how exceedingly deficient the army is 
of o-entlemen skilled in that branch of business, and that 
most of the works, which have been thrown up for the 
defence of our several encampments, have been planned 
by a few of the principal officers of this army, assisted 
by Mr. Knox, a gentleman of Worcester. Could I af- 
ford you the desired assistance in this way, I should do 
it with pleasure.

It ought to have been sent sooner, but I am at present

The enclosed return shows, at one view, what reli-

Cambridge, 4 November, 1775 ^j y 

Sir, 
Your favor of the 3 1st ultimo was presented to me 
yesterday. I thank you, as I shall do every gentleman, 
for suggesting any measure, which you conceive to be 
conducive to the public service ; but, in the adoption of a 
plan, many things are to be considered to decide upon 
the utility of it. In the one proposed by you, I shall 
not undertake to determine whether it be good, or 
whether it be bad ; but thus much I can say, that if 
there is any spot upon the main, which has an equal 
command of the ship-channel to Boston harbour (and 
give me leave to add that Point Alderton is not without 
its advocates), in all other respects it must have infi- 
nitely the preference ; because the expense of so many 
batteries as you propose, with the necessary defences to 
secure the channel, the communication, and a retreat in 
the dernier resort from the east end of Long Island, are 
capital objections. Not, I confess, of such importance 
as to weigh against the object in view, if the scheme is 
practicable. But what signifies Long Island, Point Al- 
derton, and Dorchester, while we are in a manner des- 
titute of cannon, and compelled to keep the little powder 
we have for the use of the musketry. The knowledge 

* Mr. Quincy, father ofJosiah Q^uincy, Junior, an interesting memoir of 
whose life has recently been published, resided in Braintree, and had sug- 
gested to General Washington a plan for blocking up Boston harbour, and 
taking the whole British army and fleet. Being thoroughly acquainted 
with the islands in the harbour, and the ship-channels, he conceived it 
practicable to construct such works at suitable points, as would prevent 
the egress of the shipping. He communicated his scheme to Dr. Franklin, 
who paid him a visit while attending the committee of conference at camp, 
and by whose advice he wrote at large on the subject to Washington. 
Want of cannon and powder was an insuperable objection to making the 
attempt, however feasible in itself

of this fact is an unanswerable argument against every 
place, and may sei've to account for my not having 
viewed the several spots, which have been so advan- 
tageously spoken of. I am not without intentions of 
making them a visit, and shall assuredly do myself the 
honor of calling upon you. In the mean while, permit 
me to thank you most cordially for your polite invitation, 
and to assure you that I am, Sir, your most obedient 
humble servant. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Cambridge, 5 November, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 
Your favor of the 26th ultimo with the enclosures, 
containing an account of the surrender of Fort Cham- 
blee, was an excellent repast, but somewhat incomplete 
for want of Montgomery's letter, a copy of which you 
omitted to enclose. On the success of your enterprise 
so far, I congratulate you, as the acquisition of Canada 
is of immeasurable importance to the cause we are en- 
gaged in. No account of Arnold since mv last. I am 
exceedingly anxious to hear from him, but flatter myself, 
that all goes well with him, as he was expressly ordered, 
in case of any discouraging event, to advertise me of it 
immediately.* 

* The situation of affairs in Canada at this time may be understood by 
the following extract from a letter, dated at Montreal, October 19th, and 
written by Brook Watson, an eminent merchant of that city, to Governor 
Franklin of New Jersey. The letter was intercepted by General Mont- 
gomery, and forwarded by him to General Schuyler. 

" Such is the wretclied state of this unha))py province," says the writer, 
"that Colonel Allen, with a few despicable wretches, would have taken 
this city on the 25th ultimo, had not its iuliabitants marched out to give 
them battle. They fought, conquered, and thereby saved the province for 
a while. Allen and his banditti were mostly taken prisoners. He is now

I much approve }'our conduct in regard to Wooster. 
My fears are at an end, as he acts in a subordinate 
character. Intimate this to General Montgomery, with 
my congratulations on his success, and the seasonable ^ i-rrh^. 
supply of powder, and wishes that his next letter may 
be dated from Montreal. If you carry your arms to 
Montreal, should not the garrisons of Niagara and De- 
troit be called upon to surrender, or threatened with the 
consequences of a refusal ? They may indeed destroy 
their stores, and, if the Indians are aiding, escape to 
Fort Chartres, but it is not very probable. 

The enclosed gazette exhibits sundry specimens of 
the skill of the new commander in issuing proclama- 
tions, and a proof, in the destruction of Falmouth, of the 
barbarous designs of the ministry. Nothing new has 
happened in this camp. Finding the ministerial troops 
resolved to keep themselves close within their lines, and 
that it was judged impracticable to get at them, I have 
fitted out six armed vessels, with the design to pick up 
some of their store-ships and transports. The rest of 
our men are busily employed in erecting barracks. I 
hope, as you have said nothing of the state of your 
health, that it is much amended, and that the cold 
weather will restore it perfectly. That it may do so, 
and that you may enjoy the fruit of your summer's labor 
and fatigue, is the sincere wish, dear Sir, of yours, &c.

of things. The Canadians before were nine tenths for tlie Bostonians. 
They are now returned to their duty ; many in arms for tlie King and the 
parishes, who had been otherwise, and daily demanding their pardon and 
taking arms for the crown." 

This Mr. Watson went over to England in the same vessel, in which 
Allen and his associates were transported as prisoners and in irons. Al- 
len's wrists and ankles were heavily manacled. In his JVarrative he 
speaks of having received much ill treatment from Watson during the 
voyage. Watson was afterwards Lord Mayor of London.

Cambridge, 6 November, 1775. 

Gentlemen, 

I received your favor of ihe 2d instant, and am very 
sorry it is not in my power to supply the necessities of 
the town of Fahnouth. I have referred the gentlemen, 
who brought me your letter, to the General Court of 
this province, who, I hope, will fall upon some method 
for your assistance. The arrival of the Cerberus man- 
of-war is very alarming ; I do not apprehend they will 
attempt to penetrate into the country, as you seem to 
fear. If they should attempt to land any of their 
men, I would have the good people of the country, by 
all means, make every opposition in their power; for 
it will be much easier to prevent their making a logd- 
ment, than to force them from it, when they have got 
possession. 

I write by this conveyance to Colonel Phinny, who 
will give you every advice and assistance in his power. 
I sincerely sympathize with the people in the distress 
they are driven to ; but it is in such times, that they 
should exert themselves in the noble cause of liberty 
and their country. I am, &c.*

design, formed for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of 
burning the effigy of the Pope, he cannot help e.xpressing his surprise, that 
there should be officers and soldiers in this army so void of common sense, 
as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this juncture ; at a time 
when we are soliciting and have really obtained the friendship and alli- 
ance of the people of Canada, whom we ought to consider as brethren em- 
barked in the same cause, the defence of the general liberty of America. 
At such a juncture and in such circumstances, to be insulting their reli-

offering the most remote insult, it is onr duty to address public tlianks to

TO BRIGADIER-GEKERAL JOHN SULLIVAN. 

Instructions. rv'l->4_i n.i^^'^ 

Sir, 

You ai-e to proceed immediately to Portsmouth in 
New Hampshire, and complete the works already be- 
gun, to secure that and the other towns, at the entrance 
of Piscataqua River, from any attacks by ships of war. 
For this purpose, you are to fix fire-ships and fire-rafts 
in such places, as you find most convenient to prevent 
the enemj^ fi-om passing up the river. 

As great calamities and distress are brought upon our 
seaport towns, through the malicious endeavours and 
false representations of many persons, holding commis- 
sions under the crown, who, not content with bringing 
destruction upon some of our principal towns, are yet 
using every art that malice can devise to reduce others 
to the same unhappy stale, in hopes by such cruel con- 
duct to please an arbitrary and tyrannical ministry, and 
to receive from them in return a continuance of such 
places and pensions, as they now hold at the expense 
of the blood and treasure of this distressed continent ; 
you are, therefore, immediately upon your arrival in that 
province, to seize such persons as hold commissions 
under the crown, and are acting as open and avowed 
enemies to their country, and hold them as hostages for 
the security of those towns, which our ministerial ene- 
mies threaten to invade. In case any attack should be 
made upon Portsmouth, or other seaports in that quar- 
ter, you are immediately to collect such force as can be 
raised to repel the invasion, and, at all hazards, to pre- 
vent the enemy from landing and taking possession of 

these our brethren, as to them we are so much indebted for every late 
happy success over the common enemy in Canada." — Orderly Book.

any posts in that quarter. When you have completed 
the works at Portsmouth, and secured the passage of 
the river there, you are to return without delay to the 
army, unless you find the enemy are about to make an 
immediate attack upon that or the neighbouring towns. 

The above is rather to be considered as matter of ad- 
vice than orders, as I do not conceive myself authorized 
to involve the continent in any expense for the defence 
of Portsmouth, or other place, out of the Une of the great 
American defence, particular colonies being called upon 
by the Congress to prepare for their own internal secu- 
rity. Given under my hand, this 7th day of November,

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

J fl^r^ ccU, n-(f 

Cambridge, 8 November, 1775. 

Sir, . , 

The immediate occasion of my giving the Congress 

the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, 

VVT^icj that, in consequence of their order signified in your let- 

. tt- z i-f ter of the 20th ultimo, I laid myself under a solemn tie 

^./So of secrecy to Captain IMacpherson, and proceeded to 

examine his plan for the destruction of the fleet in the 

harbour of Boston, with all that care and attention, 

which the importance of it deserved, and my judgment 

could lead to. But not being happy enough to coincide 

in opinion with that gentleman, and finding that his 

scheme would involve greater expense, than, under my 

doubts of its success, I thought myself justified in giving

into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to 
three gentlemen of the ai'tillery in this army, well 
versed in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. 
By them he has been convinced, that, inasmuch as he 
set out upon wrong principles, the scheme would prove 
abortive. Unwilling, however, to relinquish his favorite 
project of reducing the naval force of Great Britain, he 
is very desirous of building a number of row-galleys for 
this purpose. But as the Congress alone are competent 
to the adoption of this measure, I have advised him (al- 
though he offered to go on with the building of them at 
his own expense, till the Congress should decide) to 
repair immediately to Philadelphia with his proposals ; 
where, if they should be agreed to, or vessels of supe- 
rior force, agreeably to the wishes of most others, should 
be resolved on, he may set instantly about them, with 
all the materials upon the spot ; here, they are to be 
collected. To him, therefore, I refer for further infor- 
mation on this head. 

Our prisoners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee 
(on which happy event I most sincerely congratulate the 
Congress), being considerably augmented, and likely to 
be increased, I submit it to the wisdom of Congress, 
whether some convenient inland towns, remote from the 
post-roads, ought not to be assigned them ; the manner 
of their treatment, and their subsistence defined ; and a 
commissary or agent appointed, to sec that justice is 
done both to them and the public, and proper accounts 
rendered. Unless a mode of this sort is adopted, I fear 
there will be sad confusion hereafter, as there are great 
complaints at present. 

I reckoned without my host, when I informed the 
Congress in my last, that I should in a day or two be 
able to acquaint them with the disposition of the soldiery 
towards a new enUstment. I have been in consultation

with the generals of this army ever since Thursday last, 
endeavouring to establish new corps of officers ; but I 
find so many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I 
cannot say when they are to end, or what may be the 
consequences ; as there appears to be such an unwil- 
lingness in the officers of one government to mix in the 
same regiment with those of another ; and, without this, 
many must be dismissed, who are willing to serve, not- 
withstanding we are deficient on the whole. I am to 
have another meeting to-day upon this business, and 
shall inform you of the result. 

The council of officers are unanimously of opinion, 
that the command of the artillery should no longer con- 
tinue in Colonel Gridley ; * and, knowing of no person 
better qualified to supply his place, or whose appoint- 
ment will give more general satisfaction, I have taken the 
liberty of recommending Henry Knox to the considera- 
tion of Congress, thinking it indispensably necessarj", at 
the same time, that this regiment should consist of two 

* Colonel Gridley had been appointed by the Provincial Congress of 
Massachusetts, April 2Cth, chief engineer in the army tlien beginning to 
be organized, with a salary of one hundred and seventy pounds a year 
while in service ; and after the army should be disbanded, he was to re- 
ceive annually one hundred and twenty-three pounds for life. — MS. Jour- 
nal of Prov. Congress. — The same provision of a life annuity was ex- 
tended to the assistant-engineer. On the 20th of September, Colonel 
Gridley was commissioned to take command of the artillery of the Conti- 
nental army, but was superseded by Colonel Knox in November. His 
advanced age was assigned by Congress, as a reason for superseding him. 
At the battle of Bunker's Hill he fought with conspicuous bravery in the 
intrenchments, wliich he liad planned under Prescott, and in which he was 
wounded. Colonel Gridley was a soldier of long experience, having 
served in the two last wars, and been present at the taking of Louisburg, 
and in Wolfe's battle on tlie Plains of Abraham. — Sivett's Hist, of Bunker- 
Hill Battle, pp. 11, 44, 54. — Before the Revolution he received Iialf-pay 
as a British officer. When Colonel Knox was appointed to his place in

which he might sustain in consequence of having been in the service of

lieutenant-colonels, two majors, and twelve companies, 
agreeably to the plan and estimate handed in ; con- 
cerning which, as it differs from the last establishment, I 
should be glad to be instructed. 

I have heard nothing of Colonel Arnold since the 13th . ,j^^^ imyvw^ 
ultimo. His letter of, and journal to, that date, will / UjuUtyiA ^■ 
convey all the informadon I am able to give of him. I ^ •£ 6f, w 
think he must be in Quebec. If any mischance had 
happened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded 
an express. No account yet of the armed vessels sent 
to the St. Lawrence. I think they will meet the stores 
inward or outward bound. 

Captain Symons, in the Cerberus, lately sent from 
Boston to Falmouth, has published the enclosed decla- 
ration at that place ; and it is suspected he intends to 
make some kind of a lodgment there. I wrote imme- 
diately to Colonel Phinny of this army, who went up 
there upon the last alarm, to spirit up the people and 
oppose it at all events. Falmouth is about a hundred 
and thirty miles from this camp. * 

I have the honor to be, &,c. 

P. S. I send a general return of the troops, and 
manifests of the cargoes and vessels, taken at Plymouth. 



* The town of Falmouth seemed destined to suffer more than the usual 
calamities of war, as the victim of resentment, or the object of a bitter en- 
mity. It had been burnt to the ground by the commander of one armed 
ship, and a fortnight afterwards its ashes were insulted by the following 
menace of another. 

" Captain John Symons, commander of his Majesty's ship Cerberus, 
causeth it to be signified and made known to all persons whatever, in the 
town of Falmouth as well as the country adjacent ; that, if after this public 
notice, any violences shall be offered to any officers of the crown, or other 
peaceably disposed subjects of his Majesty ; or, if any bodies of men shall

tary works erected, otherwise than by order of his Majesty, or those acting

Dear Sir, 

The shipwreck of a vessel, said to be from Philadel- 
phia to Boston, near Plymouth, with one hundred and 
twenty pipes of wine, of which one hundred and eighteen 
are saved ; of another, from Boston to Hahfax, near 
Beverly, with about two hundred and forty pounds' 
worth of dry goods; the taking of a wood-vessel bound 
to Boston by Captain Adams ; and the sudden depar- 
ture of Mr. Randolph, occasioned by the death of his 
uncle, are all the occurrences worth noticing, w'hich 
have happened since your departure. I have ordered 
the wine and goods to this place for sale ; as also the 
papers. The latter may unfold secrets, that may not be 
pleasing to some of your townsmen, and w'hich, so soon 
K, I tf(, as known, will be communicated. I have convinced 

^ffXAAA-CA-C <rr_ Captain Macpherson, as he says, of the propriety of re- 
oJ-xJX^ "'S-S lK«o^ turning to the Congress. He sets out this day, and I 
^^^ ■* « am happy in his having an opportunity of laying before 

them a scheme for the destruction of the naval force of 
Great Britain. A letter and journal of Colonel Arnold's, 
to the 1 3th ultimo, are come to hand, a copy of which I 
enclose to the Congress, and by application to Mr. 
Thomson you can see it. I think he is in Quebec. If 
I hear nothing more of him in five days, I shall be sure 
of it. 

I had like to have forgotten what sits heaviest upon 
my mind, the new arrangement of officers. Although 

any public magazines of arms, ammunition, or other stores, it will be indis- 
pensably my duty to proceed witli the most vigorous efforts agamst the 
said town, as in open rebellion against the King ; and if after this signifi- 
cation the town shall persist in tlie rebellious acts above mentioned, they 
may depend on my proceeding accordingly."

we have now enough to constitute the new corps, it has 
employed the general officers and myself ever since 
Thursday last, and we are nearly as we began. Con- 
necticut wants no Massachusetts man in her corps ; 
Massachusetts thinks there is no necessity for a Rhode- 
Islander to be introduced into hers ; and New Hamp- 
shire says, it is very hai-d, that her valuable and experi- 
enced officers, who are willing to serve, should be dis- 
carded, because her own regiments, under the new 
establishment, cannot provide for them. In short, after 
a few days' labor, I expect that numbers of officers, who 
have given in their names to serve, must be discarded 
from the Massachusetts corps, where the regiments have 
been numerous, and the number in them small, and that 
of Connecticut will be completed with a fresh recruit of 
officers from her own government. This will be de- 
parting, not only from principles of common justice, but 
from the letter of the resolve agreed on at this place ; 
but, at present, I see no help for it. We are to have 
another meeting upon the matter this day, when some- 
thing must be hit upon, as time is slipping off. My 
compliments to Mrs. Reed and to all inquiring friends. 
I am, with sincerity and truth, dear Sir, your affectionate 
humble servant.

Your favor of the 18th of September came to my 
hands on Wednesday last, through Boston, and open,

ordinance for raising two regiments to act in defence of the colony, and

as you may suppose. It might be well to recollect by 
whom you sent it, in order to discover if there has not 
been some treachery practised. 

I do not mean to flatter, when I assure you, that I 
highly approve of your appointment. The inexperi- 
ence you complain of is" a common case, and only to be 
remedied by practice and close attention. The best 
general advice I can give, and which I am sure you 
stand in no need of, is to be strict in your discipline ; 
that is, to require nothing unreasonable of your officers 
and men, but see that whatever is required be punctual- 
ly comphed with. Reward and punish every man ac- 
cording to his merit, without partiality or prejudice ; 
hear his complaints ; if Avell founded, redress them ; if 
otherwise, discourage them, in order to prevent frivolous 

same ordinance the province was divided into sixteen districts, and regula- 
tions were adopted for exercising all the militia as minute-men, and prepar- 
ing for public ser\'ice at a moment's call. — See Hening's Stat. Vol. IX. 
p. 9. Patrick Henry was appointed colonel of the hrst regiment, and com- 
mander of all the forces to be raised for the defence of the colony. Wil- 
liam Woodford was colonel ot the second regiment. 

Tlie following letter from George Mason to Washington, dated October 
14th, is characteristic of the writer, and contains some curious particulars 
in regard to the doings of the Convention. 

" I liinted to you in my last the parties and factions, wliich prevailed 
at Richmond. I never was in so disagreeable a situation, and almost 
despaired of a cause, which I saw so ill conducted. During the first part 
of the Convention, parties ran so high, that we had frequently no other 
way of preventing improper measures, tlian by procrastination, urging the 
previous question, and giving men time to reflect. However, after some 
v.-eeks, the babblers were pretty well silenced, a few weighty members 
began to take the lead, several wholesome regulations were made, and, if 
the Convention had continued to sit a few days longer, I think the public 
safety would have been as well provided for, as our present circumstances 
permit. The Convention, not thinking this a time to rely upon resolves 
and recommendations only, and to give obligatory force to their proceed- 
ings, adopted the style and form of legislation, changing tiie word enact 
into ordain. Their ordinances were all introduced in the form of bills, 
were regularly referred to a committee of the whole house, and under- 
went three readings before they were passed. 

" I enclose you the ordinance for raising an armed force for the defence

ones. Discourage vice in every shape, and impress 
upon the mind of every man, from the first to the low- 
est, the importance of the cause, and what it is they 
are contending lor. For ever keep in view the necessi- 
ty of guarding against surprises. In all your marches, 
at times, at least, even when there is no possible dan- 
ger, move with front, rear, and flank guards, that they 
may be familiarized to the use ; and be regular in your 
encampments, appointing necessary guards for the se- 
curity of your camp. In short, whether you expect an 
enemy or not, this should be practised ; otherwise your 
attempts will be confused and awkward, when neces- 
sary. Be plain and precise in your orders, and keep 
copies of them to refer to, that no mistakes may happen. 
Be easy and condescending in your deportment to your 

and protection of this colony. It is a little defaced by being handled at 
our district committee, but it is the only copy I liave at present by me. 
You ivUl find some little inaccuracies in it, but, upon tlie whole, I hope it 
will merit your approbation. Tlie minute-plan I think is a wise one, and 
will in a short time furnish eiglit thousand good troops, ready for action, 
and composed of men in whose hands the sword may be safely trusted. 
To defray the expense of the provisions made by this ordinance, and to 
pay the charge of the last year's Indian war, we are now emitting the 
sum of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds in paper currency. I 
have gTeat apprehensions, that the large sums in bills of credit now issu- 
ing all over the continent may have fatal effects in depreciating the value ; 
and, therefore, I opposed any suspension of taxation, and urged the ne- 
cessity of immediately laying such ta.xes as the people could bear, to sink 
the sum emitted as soon as possible ; but I was able only to reduce the 
proposed suspension from three years to one. 

" Our friend, the treasurer, was the wannest man in tlie convention for 
immediately raising a standing army of not less than four thousand men, 
upon constant pay. They stood a considerable time at three tiiousand, 
exclusive of the troops upon the western frontiers ; but, at the last reading, 
as you will see by the ordinance, they were reduced to one tiiousand and 
twenty rank and file. In my opinion, a well judged reduction, not only 
from our inability to furnish at present such a number with arms and am- 
munition, but I think it extremely imprudent to exhaust ourselves before 
we know when we are to be attacked. The part we have to act at pres- 
ent seems to require our laying in good magazines, training our people, 
and having a good number of them ready for action."

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
/ Camp at Cambridge, 11 November, 1775. 

Sir, 

.^K • Enclosed you have a copy of an act passed this ses- 

sion, by the honorable Council and House of Repre- 
sentatives of this province.* It respects such captures 

* This act is remarkable as having been the first, which was passed by

as may be made by vessels fitted out by the province, 
or by individuals thereof. As the armed vessels, fitted 
out at the Continental expense, do not come under this 
law, I would have it submitted to the consideration of 
Congress, to point out a more summary way of proceed- 
ing, to determine the property and mode of condemna- 
tion of such prizes, as have been or hereafter may be 
made, than is specified in this act. 

Should not a court be established by authority of 
Congress, to take cognizance of prizes made by the 
Continental vessels 7 Whatever the mode is, which they 
are pleased to adopt, there is an absolute necessity of 
its being speedily determined on ; for I cannot spare 
time from military affairs, to give proper attention to 
these matters. 

The inhcibitants of Plymouth have taken a sloop, 
laden with provisions, from Halifax, bound to Boston ; 
and the inhabitants of Beverly have, under cover of one 
of the armed schooners, taken a vessel from Ireland, 
laden with beef, pork, butter, &c. for the same place. 
The latter brings papers and letters of a very interest- 
ing nature, which are in the hands of the honorable . "^ B 
Council, who informed me they will transmit them to 
you by this conveyance. To the contents of these 
papers and letters I must beg leave to refer you and 
the honorable Congress, who will now see the absolute 

cer knowingly presume to enlist any soldier, who has been previously 
enlisted by another officer. When such a mistake happens undesignedly, 
the first enlistment is to take place. The officers are to be careful not to 
enlist any person suspected of being unfriendly to the liberties of Ameri- 
ca, or any abandoned vagabond to whom all causes and countries are 
equal and alike indifferent. The rights of mankind and the freedom of 
America will have numbers sufficient to support them, without resorting 
to such wretched assistance. Let those, who wish to put shackles upon 
freemen, fill their ranks with such miscreants, and place their confidence 
in them. Neither negroes, boys unable to bear arms, nor old men unfit 
to endure the fatigues of the campaign, are to be enlisted."

necessity of exerting all their wisdom, to withstand the 
mighty efforts of our enemies. 

The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is 
really inconceivable. Many of the officers sent in their 
names to serve, in expectation of promotion; others 
stood aloof to see what advantage they could make for 
themselves ; w hilst a number, who had declined, have 
again sent in their names to serve. So great has the 
confusion, arising from these and many other perplexing 
circumstances, been, that I found it absolutely impossible 
to fix this very interesting business exactly on the plan 
resolved on in the conference, though I have kept up to 
the spirit of it, as near as the nature and necessity of the 
case would admit. The difficulty with the soldiers is as 
great, indeed more so, if possible, than with the offi- 
cers. They will not enlist, until they know their 
colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, and captain ; so that it 
was necessary to fix the officers the first thing ; which 
is, at last, in some manner done ; and I have given out 
enlisting orders. 

You, Sir, can much easier judge, than I can express, 
the anxiety of mind I must labor under on the occasion, 
especially at this time, when we may expect the enemy 
will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, 
part of w^hich is already come, and the remainder daily 
dropping in. 

I have other distresses of a very alarming nature. 
The arms of our soldiery are so exceedingly bad, that 
I assure you. Sir, I cannot place a proper confidence 
in them. Our powder is wasting fast, notwithstanding 
the strictest care, economy, and attention are paid to it. 
The long series of wet weather, which we have had, 
renders the greater part of what has been served out to 
the men of no use. Yesterday I haTl a proof of it, as* a 
party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking

the advantage of a high tide, landed at Lechmere's 
Point; we were alarmed, and of course ordered every 
man to examine his cai-touch-box, when the melancholy 
truth appeai-ed; and we were obliged to furnish the 
greater part of them with fresh ammunition. 

The damage done at the Point was the taking of a 
man, who watched a few horses and cows ; ten of the 
latter they carried ofl". Colonel Thompson marched 
down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by 
Colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of 
Patterson's regiment, who gallantly waded through the 
water, and soon obliged the enemy to embark under 
cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire 
of a battery on Charlestown Neck. We have two of 
our men dangerously wounded by grape-shot from the 
man-of-war; and, by a flag sent out this day, we are 
informed the enemy lost two of their men.* I have 
the honor to be, &c. 

* In writing' to Colonel Reed a few days afterwards, Washington spoke 
in the following manner of this affair. " The alacrity of the riflemen and 
oflicers upon that occasion did tliem honor, to which Colonel Patterson's 
regiment and some others were equally entitled, except in a few instan- 
ces ; but the tide, at that time, was so exceedingly high as to compel a 
large circuit before our men could get to the causeway, by which means 
the enemy, except a small covering party, distant from the dry land on 
this side near four hundred yards, had retreated, or were about to embark. 
All the shot, therefore, that passed were at a great distance ; liowever, 
the men went to and over the causeway spiritedly enough. This little 
manoeuvre of the enemy is nothing more than a prelude. We have cer- 
tain advice of a scoundrel from Marblehead, a man of property, having 
can-ied to General Howe a true state of the temper and disposition of the 
troops towards the new enlistment, and given liim the strongest assuran- 
ces of the practicability of making himself master of these lines in a very 
short time, from the disaffection of the soldiers to the service. I am en- 
deavouring to counteract him ; how effectually, time alone can show. I 
began our bomb-b'ittery at Lechmere's Point last night ; the working 
party came off in the morning without having met with any interruption. 
The weather favored our operations, the earth being clear of frost. There 
is not an officer in the amiy, who does not look for an attack. This has 
no effect upon the Coimecticut regiments ; they are resolved to go off."

.,t . -i TO WILLIAM PALFREY, PORTSMOUTH. 

Cambridge, 12 November, 177.5. 

Sir, 
At a time when some of our seaport towns are 
cruelly laid in ashes, and ruin and devastation de- 
nounced against others ; when the arms are demanded 
of the inhabitants, and hostages required, in effect, for 
the surrender of their liberties ; when General Howe by 
proclamation, under the threat of military execution, 
has forbidden the inhabitants of Boston to leave the 
town without his permission first had and obtained in 
writing ; when, by another proclamation, he strictly 
forbids any persons bringing out of that place more 

* William Palfrey was a native of Boston, born in 1741, and educated 
a merchant under the auspices of John Hancock. Before the revolution 
he was engaged in mercantile affairs in Boston, and towards the close of 
the year 1774 he sailed on a voyage to South Carolina, and thence to 
England, in a vessel belonging to Hancock. From a journal, which he 
kept during his stay in London, and which I have seen, he appears to have 
been on terms of intimacy with some of the leaders of the high Whig 
party, and it is probable, that his visit to the metropolis of Great Britain 
had a political as well as commercial object. He returned to Massachu- 
setts a few days before General Washington took command of the army, 
and was immediately employed on business of trust and importance. 
Assuming a military character, he was for some time aid to General 
Charles Lee, and aftern-ards to General Washington, and received a lieu- 
tenant-colonel's commission. On the 27th of April, 1776, he was by Con- 
gress appointed paymaster-general of the army, a station of great re- 
sponsibility, which, for more than four years and a half, he filled in such a 
manner as to give universal satisfaction. During tliis period he had ex- 
hibited such proofs of his talents for business, fidelity, and devotedness to 
the cause of his country, that, on the 4tli of November, 1780, he was 
elected Consul-General from the United States to France, an office at this 
time of much consideration, as it involved the duties of making extensive 
purchases of military and other supplies for the country, and an examina- 
tion and settlement of all the accounts, in which the United States were 
concerned with public and private agents in Europe, and which had been 
multiplying and accumulating since the commencement of the war. He 
sailed for France, but the vessel in which he took passage was lost at sea, 
and every one on board was supposed to have perished.

than five pounds sterling of their property in specie, 
because truly the ministerial ai-my under his command 
may be injured by it ; and when, by a third proclama- 
tion, after leaving the inhabitants no alternative, he calls 
upon them to take arms under officers of his appoint- 
ing ; it is evident, that the most tyrannical and cruel 
system is adopted for the destruction of the rights and 
liberties of this continent, that ever disgraced the most 
despotic ministry, and ought to be opposed by every 
means in our power. I therefore desire, that you will 
delay no time in causing the seizure of every officer of 
government at Portsmouth, who has given proofs of his 
unfriendly disposition to the cause we are engaged in ; 
and when you have secured all such, take the opinion 
of the provincial Congress, or Committee of Safety, in 
what manner to dispose of them in that government. 

I do not mean that they should be kept in close con- 
finement. If either of these bodies should incline to 
send them to any interior towns, upon their parole not 
to leave them until released, it will meet with my con- 
currence. For the present I shall avoid giving you the 
like order in respect to the Tories in Portsmouth ; but 
the day is not far off, when they will meet with this or 
a worse fate, if there is not a considerable reformation 
in their conduct. Of this they may be assured from. 
Sir, your most humble servant.* 

* To Governor Trumbull he wrote at the same time ; — "As it is now 
very apparent, that we have nothing to depend on in the present contest, 
but our own strengtli, care, firmness, and union ; should not the same mea- 
sures be adopted in your and every other government on the continent ? 
Would it not be prudent to seize on those Tories, who have been, are, and 
that we know will be, active against us? Why .should persons, who are 
preying upon the vitals of their country, be suffered to stalk at large, 
whilst we know they will do us every mischief in their power ? These, 
Sir, are points I beg to submit to your serious consideration."

vv<^ /^''V^ Sir, 

You are immediately to examine into the state of the 
artillery of this army, and take an account of the 
^ ., _. cannon, mortars, shells, lead, and ammunition, that are 

' ' wanting. When you have done that, you are to pro- 

ceed in the most expeditious manner to New York, 
there to apply to the President of the Provincial Con- 
gress, and learn of him, whether Colonel Reed did any 
thing, or left any orders respecting these articles, and 
get him to procure such of them as can possibly be 
had there. 

The President, if he can, will have them immediately 
sent hither ; if he cannot, you must put them in a 
proper channel for being transported to this camp with 
despatch, before you leave New York. After you have 
procured as many of these necessaries as you can there, 
you must go to Major-General Schuyler, and get the re- 
mainder from Ticonderoga, Crown Point, or St, John's ; 
if it should be necessary, from Quebec, if in our hands. 
The want of them is so great, that no trouble or ex- 
pense must be spared to obtain them. I have written 
to General Schuyler ; he will give every necessary 
assistance, that they may be had and forwarded to this 
place with the utmost despatch. I have given you a 
vv'arrant to the paymaster-general of the Continental 
army for a thousand dollars, to defray the expense at- 
tending your journey and procuring these articles ; an 
account of which you are to keep and render upon 
your return. Given under my hand at Head-Quarters,

(^amp at Cambridge, 17 November, 1775. 

Sir, 

As the season is fast approaching, when the bay v',,^ xjCvifi' f^ />^ 
between us and Boston will in all probability be close ,^ . ^ ^yy^gi^ c^ 

shut up, thereby rendering any movement upon the ice 
as easy as if no water was there ; and as it is more 
than probable, that General Howe, when he gets the 
expected reinforcement, will endeavour to relieve him- 
self from the disgraceful confinement in which the 
ministerial troops have been all this summer; common 
prudence dictates the necessity of guarding our camps 
wherever they are most assailable. For this purpose, 
I Avish you, General Thomas, General Spencer, and 

had served in tlie former war, in wliicli he had borne a part in several en- 
gagements, and was a gentleman highly respected. He commanded one 
of the Massachusetts regiments, but, on account of his advanced age, he 
was omitted in arranging tlie new army. The soldiers of his regiment 
were so much dissatisfied, tliat they resolved not to enlist under any other 
officer. He exhorted them not to be influenced by such a motive, in a 
cause so important ; and, to induce tliem to remain, he proposed to join 
them in the ranks. 

" .Voi'emfter 16(ft. Motives of economy rendering it indispensably ne- 
cessary, that many of the regiments should be reduced, and the whole 
put upon a different establishment, several deserving officers, not from any 
demerit, but pure necessity, have been excluded in the new arrange- 
ment of the army. Among these was Colonel Whitcomb ; but the noble 
sentiments disclosed by that gentleman upon this occasion, the zeal he 
has shown in exhorting the men not to abandon the interest of their coun- 
try at this important crisis, and his determination to continue in the ser- 
vice, even as a private soldier, rather than by a bad example, when the 
enemy are gathering strengtii, to put the public affairs to hazard ; when an 
example of this kind is set, it not only entitles a gentleman to particular 
thanks, but to particular rewards. Colonel Jonathan Brewer is entitled to 
no small share of credit, in readily giving up to Colonel Whitcomb the 
regiment, which he was appointed to command. Colonel Whitcomb, 
therefore, is henceforward to be considered as Colonel of that regiment, 
which was intended for Colonel Brewer ; and Colonel Brewer will be 
appointed Barrack-Master, until something better worth his acceptance 
can be provided." — Orderly Book.

between your work at the Mill and Sewall's Point, and 
direct such batteries, as shall appear necessary lor the 
security of your camp on that side, to be thrown up 
without loss of time. 

I have long had it upon my mind, that a successful 
attempt might be made by way of surprise on Castle 
William. From every account, there are not more than 
three hundred men in that place. The whale-boats, 
therefore, which you have, and such as could be sent to 
you, would easily transport eight hundred or one thou- 
sand men, who, with a very moderate share of conduct 
and resolution, might, I should think, bring off the 
garrison, if not the stores. I wish you to discuss this 
matter, under the rose, with officers on whose judg- 
men and spirit you can rely. Something of this sort 
may show how far the men may be depended upon. I 
am, with great respect, Sir, your very humble servant. *

Commander-in-chief has ordered them to be armed, and formed into three

persons can be found, I will despatch them to Nova 
Scotia, on the service resolved on by Congress. 

The resolve to raise two battaUons of marines will, if 
practicable in this army, entirely derange what has been 
done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the 
two battalions;" of course, a colonel must be dismissed. 
One of the many difficulties, which attended the new 
arrangement, was in reconciUng the different inter- 
ests, and judging of the merits of the different colonels. 
In the dismission of this one, the same difficulties will 
occur. The officers and men must be acquainted with 
maritime affairs ; to comply with which, they must be 
picked out of the whole army, one from this corps, one 
from another, so as to break through the whole system, 
which it has cost us so much time, anxiety, and pains, to 
bring into any tolerable form. Notwithstanding any 
difficulties which will arise, you may be assured, Sir, that 
I will use every endeavour to comply with their resolve. 

I beg leave to submit it to the consideration of Con- 
gress, if those two battalions can be formed out of this 
army, whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by 
employing any of the officers appointed to defend them 
on any other service ? The gentlemen, who were here 
from Congress, know their vast extent ; they must know, 
that we shall have occasion for our whole force for that 
purpose, more now than at any past time, as we may 
expect the enemy will take the advantage of the first 
hard weather, and attempt to make an impression 
somewhere. 

As there is every appearance, that this contest will 
not be soon decided, and of course that there must be 
an augmentation of the Continental army, would it not 
be eligible to raise two battalions of marines in New 
York and Philadelphia, where there must be numbers of 
sailors now unemployed ? This, however, is matter of 



164 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

opinion, which I mention with all due deference to the 
superior judgment of the Congress. 

Enclosed you have copies of two letters, one from 
Colonel Arnold, the other from Colonel Enos. I can 
form no judgment on the latter's conduct, until I see 
him.* Notwithstanding the great defection, I do not 
despair of Colonel Arnold's success. He will have, in 
all probability, many more difficulties to encounter, than 
if he had been a fortnight sooner; as it is likely that 
Governor Carleton will, with what forces he can collect 
after the surrender of the rest of Canada, throw him- 
self into Quebec, and there make his last effort. 

There is no late account from Captains Broughton and 
Sellman, sent to the River St. Lawrence. The other 
cruisers have been chiefly confined to harbours, by the 
badness of the weather. The same reason has caused 
great delay in the building of our barracks ; which, with 
a most mortifying scarcity of firewood, discourages the 
men from enlisting. The last, I am afraid, is an insu- 
perable obstacle. I have applied to the honorable 
House of Representatives of this province, who were 

. t enf: ij^ * Colonel Enos commanded the rear division of tlie army under Arnold. 

When he arrived at the great Carrying-Place, between the Kennebec and 
Dead Rivers, he wrote to Colonel Arnold, who was then in advance, 
making inquiry about provisions. Arnold replied, that the stock was 
sufficient for twenty-five days. But before Enos got over the Carrying- 
Place, Major Bigelow was sent back from Colonel Greene's division with 
ninety men for provisions. Enos supplied them, and marched onward till 
he overtook Colonel Greene fifty miles up the Dead River. Here he re- 
ceived orders from Arnold to furnish Colonel Greene with provisions 
enough for his men in their march to the settlements on the Chaudi^re 
River. After executing this order, he had no more than six days' pro- 
vions left for his own troops. In this condition it was the opinion of the 
officers, that the rear division ought to return. 

Such is Colonel Enos's account, in his letter to Washington, and the 
court-martial acquitted him on the ground here assigned. But from Ar- 
nold's letters since published, it would appear, that he did not represent 
the matter with perfect accuracy. On the 15th of October, Arnold wrote 
to him, that there were twenty-five days' provisions. Arnold went

pleased to appoint a committee to negotiate this busi- 
ness ; and, notwithstanding all the pains they have taken, 
and are taking, they find it impossible to supply our ne- 
cessities. The want of a sufficient number of teams I 
understand to be the chief impediment. 

I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the 
numbers enlisted in their regiments. The whole amount 
is nine hundred and sixty-six men. There must be 
some other stimulus, besides love for their country, to 
make men fond of the service. It would be a great 
encouragement, and no additional expense to the conti- 
nent, were they to receive pay for the months of Octo- 
ber and November ; also a month's pay in advance. The 
present state of the military chest will not admit of this. 
The sooner it is enabled to do so the better. 

The commissary-general is daily expected in camp. 
I cannot send you the estimate of the clerks in his de- 
partment, until he arrives. 

I sincerely congratulate you upon the success of your 
arms, in the surrender of St. John's, which I hope is a 
happy presage of the reduction of the rest of Canada. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

forward, and wrote again on the 24th, from Chaudiere Pond, that, on ac- H<,0_'t_ 

count of heavy rains, there had been a delay, and it would take twelve or 

fifteen days for tlie army to reach the inhabited country. He ordered 

Enos, tlierefore, and Greene, to select such a number of their best men, as 

could be supplied with fifteen days' provisions, and send the others, with 

the sick, back to the commissary at Norridgewock. Instead of obeying 

this order, Enos gave his provisions to Greene, except enough for his 

division of the troops on their return to Norridgewock, and immediately 

retraced his steps with all his men. 

Although he was acquitted by the court-martial, and received a lieu- 
tenant-colonel's commission in the new army, yet he was not satisfied with 
the evidences he received of the good opinion of the Commander-in-chief, 
and in January he asked leave to resign. He removed to Vermont, and 
in 1781 was appointed a general and commander of the militia of that 
state, and became somewhat conspicuous as an actor in public affairs. —

TO JOSEPH REBD. 

Camp at Cambridge, 20 November, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 
The hint contained in the last of your letters, respect- 
ing your continuance in my family, in other words, vour 
wish that I could dispense with it, gives me pain. You 
already, my dear Sir, know my sentiments on this 
matter ; you cannot but be sensible of your importance 
to me ; at the same time I shall again repeat, what I 
have observed to you before, that I can never think of 
promoting my convenience at the expense of your 
interest and inclination. You can judge, that I feel the 
' — — -, want of you, when I inform you, that the peculiar situa- 

tion of Mr. Randolph's affairs obliged him to leave this 
i 'e place soon after you did ; that Mr. Baylor, contrary to 

my expectation, is not in the smallest degree a penman, 

though spirited and willing; and that Mr. Harrison, 

CXsj^v^ &<«■?. VVu.- though sensible, [clear^ and perfectly confidential, has 

iuruv * never yet moved upon so large a scale, as to compre- 

' iXc.U-vv-.-*„-^ ,. hend at one view the diversity of matter, which comes 

■'^>,a/'C" > before me, so as to afford that ready assistance, which 

every man in my situation must stand more or less in 

need of. Mr. Moylan, it is true, is very obliging ; he 

gives me what assistance he can ; but other business 

must necessarily deprive me of his aid in a very short 

time. 

This is my situation ; judge you, therefore, how much 
I wished for your return, especially as the armed vessels, 
and the capital change in the state of this army about 
to take place, have added a new weight to a biu'then, 
before too great for me to stand under with the smallest 
degree of comfort to my own feelings. My mind is 
now fully disclosed to you, with this assurance sincerely 
and affectionately accompanying it, that whilst you 



<tv-*v- 






Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 167 

are disposed to continue with me, I shall think mysell" 
too fortunate and happy to wish for a change. 

Dr. Morgan, as director of the hospital, is exceeding- 
ly wanted at this place, and ought not to delay his de- >v*i^a^ 
parture lor the camp a moment, many regulations being 
deferred, and accounts postponed, till his arrival. The 
method you have suggested, concerning the advanced 
pay, I very much approve, and would adopt it, but for 
the unfortunate and cramped state of our treasury, 
which keeps us for ever under the hatches. Pray urge 
the necessity of this measure to such members as you 
may converse with, and the want of cash to pay the 
troops for the months of October and November ; as 
also to answer the demands of the commissary and 
quartermaster, and for contingencies. To do all this, 
a considerable sum will be necessary. Do not neglect 
to put that wheel in motion, which is to bring us the 
shirts and medicines from New York ; they are much 
M'anted here, and cannot be had, I should think, upon 
better ternis than on a loan from the best of Kings, so 
anxiously disposed to promote the welfare of his Ameri- 
can subjects. 

Dr. Church is gone to Governor Trumbull, to be dis- 
posed of in a Connecticut gaol without the use of pen, 
ink, or paper, to be conversed with in the presence of 
a magistrate only, and in the English language. So 
much for indiscretion, the Doctor will say. Your ac- 
count of our dependence upon the people of Great 
Britain, I religiously believe. It has long been my 
political creed, that the ministry would not have dared 
to go on as they did, but under the firmest persuasion 
that the people were with them. The weather has 
been unfavorable, however, for the arrival of their trans- 
ports ; only four companies of the seventeenth regiment 
and two of the artillery are yet arrived, by our last ad- 
vices from Boston, 



168 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 43. 

Our pnvateersmen go on at the old rate, mutinying if 
they cannot do as they please. Those at Plymouth, 
Beverly, and Portsmouth, have done nothing worth 
mentioning in the prize way, and no accounts are yet 
received from those farther eastward. Arnold, by a 
letter which left him the 27th ultimo, had then only got 
to the Chaudiere Pond, and was scarce of provisions. 
His rear division, under the command of Colonel Enos, 
had, without his privity or consent, left him with three 
companies ; and his expedition, inasmuch as it is to be 
apprehended, that Carleton, with the remains of such 
force as he had been able to raise, would get into Que- 
bec before him, I fear is in a bad way. For further 
particulars I refer you to Mr. Hancock to whom are en- 
closed copies of Arnold's and Enos's letters. The last- 
named person is not yet arrived at this camp. 

I thank you for your frequent mention of Mrs. Wash- 
ington. I expect that she will be in Philadelphia about 
the time this letter may reach you, on her way hither. 
As she and her conductor, who I suppose will be 
Mr. Custis, her son, are perfect strangers to the road, 
the stages, and the proper place to cross Hudson's Riv- 
er, by all means avoiding New York, I shall be much 
obhged by your particular instructions and advice to her. 
I imagine, as the roads are bad and the weather cold, 
her stages must be short, especially as I presume her 
horses will be fatigued ; as when they get to Philadel- 
phia, they will have performed a journey of at least four 
hundred and fifty miles, my express having found her 
among her friends near Williamsburg, one hundred and 
fifty miles below my own house. 

My respectful compliments to Mrs. Reed, and be as- 
sured that I am, dear Sir, with affectionate regard, &,c.

TO AARON WILLARD. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 
The honorable Continental Congress having lately 
passed a resolve, expressed in the following words, — 
" That two persons be sent, at the expense of these 
colonies, to Nova Scotia to inquire into the state of that 
colon}', the disposition of the inhabitants towards the 
American cause, the condition of the fordfications and 
dock-yai'ds, the quantity of artillery and warlike stores, 
and the number of soldiers, sailors, and ships of 
war there, and transmit the earliest intelligence to 
General Washington ; " I do hereby consdtute and ap- 
point you, the said Aaron Willard, to be one of the 
persons to undertake this business ; and, as the season 
is late and this a work of great importance, I entreat 
and request, that you will use the utmost despatch, at- 
tention, and fidelity in the execution of it. The 
necessity of acting with a proper degree of caution and 
secrecy is too apparent to need recommendation. 

You will keep an account of your expenses, and, 
upon your return, will be rewarded in a suitable manner 
for the fatigue of your journey, and the services you 
render your country, by conducting and discharging this 
business with expedition and fidelity. Given under my 
hand, this 24th day of November, 1775.* 

* The associate of Mr. Willard, on this mission, was Moses Child. 
These commissioners proceeded by land to the borders of Nova Scotia, 
where they were met by two proclamations of the Governor of that prov- 
ince ; the one " warning all persons, that tiiey do not in any manner, di- 
rectly or indirectly, aid or assist with any supplies whatever any rebel 
or rebels, nor hold intelligence or correspondence with them, nor conceal, 
harbour, or protect any such offender, as they would avoid being deemed 
rebels and traitors, and proceeded against accordingly ; " and the other.

170 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt.^. 



TO LUND WASHINGTON, MOUNT VERNON.* 

Cambridge, 26 November, 1775. 

What follows is part of a letter written to Mr. Lund 
Washington, the 26th day of November, 1775. A copy 
is taken to remind me of my engagements and the exact 
purport of them. 

" I well know where the difficulty of accomplishing 
these things will lie. Overseers are already engaged, 
upon shares, to look after my business. Remote ad- 
vantages to me, however manifest and beneficial, are 
nothing to them ; and to engage standing wages, when 
I do not know that any thing that I have, or can raise, 
will command cash, is attended with hazard ; for which 
reason, I hardly know what more to say, than to discov- 

making their business known to a justice of the peace, upon the pain and 
peril of being treated as spies." The commissioners tliought it prudent 
to return to Cambridge, where they reported little else, than that, " from 
their own knowledge, and the best information from others, about eight 
parts in ten of the inhabitants of Nova Scotia would engage in the com- 
mon cause of America, could they be protected." The grounds upon 
which they founded tliis opinion are not stated. 

Another resolve was also passed by Congress, at the same time with 
the one cited in the above letter, by which General Washington was di- 
rected, "in case he should judge it practicable and expedient, to send into 
Nova Scotia a sufficient force to take away the cannon and warlike stores, 
and to destroy the docks, yards, and magazines, and to take and destroy 
any ships of war or transports there, belonging to our enemies." No 
attempts were made to put tliis resolve in execution. 

* Mr. Lund Washington was the agent for superintending General 
Washington's plantations, and managing his business concerns, during 
the revolution. It was not known what degree of faraOy relationship 
existed between them, though it was supposed, that they both descended 
from the same original stock. Their ancestors came to America at 
different times, doubtless emigrating from different parts of England, 
and the name is the only evidence of consanguinity, which either branch 
of the family possesses. 

From the beginning to the end of the revolution, Lund Washington 
wrote to the General as often at least as two or three times a month, 
and commonly every week, detailing minutely all the events that oc- 



PartII.1 the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 171 

er to you my wishes. The same reason, although it 
may in appearance have the same tendency in respect 
to you, shall not be the same in its operation ; for I will 
engage for the year coming, and the year following, if 
these troubles and my absence continue, that your wa- 
ges shall be standing and certain, at the highest amount, 
that any one year's crop has produced to you yet. I 
do not offer this as any temptation to induce you to go 
on more cheerfully in prosecuting these schemes of 
mine. I should do injusdce to you, were I not to ac- 
knowledge, that your conduct has ever appeared to me 
above every thing sordid ; but I offer it in consideration 
of the great charge you have upon your hands, and 
my entire dependence upon your fidelity and industry. 

" It is the greatest, indeed it is the only comfortable 
reflection I enjoy on this score, that my business is in 
the hands of a person concerning w hose integrity I have 
not a doubt, and on whose care I can rely. Were it 
not for this, I should feel very unhappy, on account of 
the situation of my affairs ; but I am persuaded you 
will do for me as you would for yourself, and more than 
this I cannot expect. 

" Let the hospitality of the house, with respect to the 
poor, be kept up. Let no one go hungry away. If any 

curred on the plantations, his purchases, sales, and payments of money, 
the kinds and quantity of produce, occupations of the laborers, and 
whatever else could tend to explain the precise condition and progress 
of the business in his hands. These letters were regularly answered 
by the General, even when the weight and embarrassment of public 
duties pressed most heavily upon him, and full instructions were re- 
turned for regulating the plans and conduct of the manager. Hardly 
any copies of this description of letters were recorded, if retained, and 
the originals have been lost or destroyed. But Lund Washington's 
letters are preserved, and they give evidence of the extraordinary 
attention bestowed by the Commander-in-chief on his domestic affairs, 
though several hundred miles from home, and bearing a burden of pub- 
lic cares, which alone was enough to distract and exliaust tlie firmest 
mind. 



172 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

of this kind of people should be in want of corn, supply 
their necessities, provided it does not encourage them 
in idleness ; and I have no objection to your giving my 
money in charity, to the amount of forty or fifty pounds 
a year, when you think it well bestowed. What I 
mean by having no objection is, that it is my desire that 
it should be done. You are to consider, that neither 
myself nor wife is now in the way to do these good 
offices. In all other respects, I recommend it to you, 
and have no doubt of your observing the greatest 
economy and frugality ; as I suppose you know, that I 
do not get a farthing for my services here, more than 
my expenses. It becomes necessary, therefore, for me 
to be saving at home." 

The above is copied, not only to remind myself of 
my promises and requests, but others also, if any mis- 
chance happens to me. 



TO RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Camp at Cambridge, 27 November, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 13th, with the enclosures, for 
which I thank you, came to this place on Wednesday 
evening; part of which, that is, the night, I was en- 
gaged with a party of men throwing up a work upon a 
hill, called Cobble Hill, which, in case we should ever 
be supplied with such things as we want, may prove 
useful to us, and could not be delayed, as the earth 
here is getting as hard as a rock. This, and the early 
departure of the post, prevented my giving your letter 
an answer the next morning. 

In answer to your inquiries respecting armed vessels, 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 173 

there are none of any tolerable force belonging to this 
government. I know of but two of any kind; those 
very small. At the Continental expense I have fitted 
out six, as by the enclosed list, two of which are upon 
the cruise directed by Congress ; the rest ply about Cape 
Cod and Cape Ann, as yet to very little purpose. These 
vessels are all manned by officers and soldiers, except 
perhaps a master and pilots ; but how far, as they are 
upon the old establishment, which has not more than a 
month to exist, they can be ordered off this station, I 
will not undertake to say, but suppose they might be 
engaged anew. Belonging to Providence there are two 
armed vessels; and I am told Connecticut has one, 
which, with one of those from Providence, is, I beheve, 
upon the cruise you have directed. 

I have no idea that the troops can remove from Bos- 
ton this winter to a place, where no provision is made 
for them ; however, we shall keep the best look-out we 
can ; and upon that, and every occasion where practica- 
ble, give them the best we have. But their situation in 
Boston gives them but litde to apprehend from a part- 
ing blow, whilst their ships can move, and floating bat- 
teries surround the town. 

Nothing of importance has happened since my last. 
For God's sake hurry the signers of money, that our 
Avants may be supplied. It is a very singular case, that 
their signing cannot keep pace with our demands. I 
heartily congratulate you and the Congress on the re- 
duction of St. John's. I hope all Canada is in our 
possession before this. No accounts from Arnold since 
those mentioned in my last letter to the Congress. 
Would it not be politic to invite them to send mem- 
bers to Congress? Would it not be also politic to 
raise a regiment or two of Canadians, and bring them 
out of the country? They are good troops, and this 



174 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS [JEr.43. 

would be entering them heartily in the cause.* My 
best regards to the good families you are with, I am, 
very affectionately, your obedient servant. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp at Cambridge, 28 November, 1775. 

Sir, 

"' -^ I ' 1 I had the honor of writing to you on the 19th instant. 

ypUr^ ^<P''**« ^ ^^^^ ^*^^ **^ inform you that Mr. Henry Knox is gone 

' to New York, with orders to forward to this place what 

cannon and ordnance stores can be there procured. 

From thence he will proceed to General Schuyler on 

the same business, as you will see by the enclosed copy 

of instructions, which I have given him. It would give 

me much satisfaction, if this gentleman, or any other 

whom you may think qualified, were appointed to the 

command of the artillery regiment. In my letter to 

you of the 8th instant, I have expressed myself fully 

on this subject, which I beg leave to recommend to 

* Congress had already provided for these measures, in the instruc- 
tions given to a committee appointed to proceed to tlie nortliern army, for 
the purpose of conferring with General Schuyler on the affairs of his 
department. It is there stated, that " Congress desire you to exert 
your utmost endeavours to induce the Canadians to accede to a union 
with these colonies, and that they form from their several parishes a 
provincial convention, and send delegates to this Congress," — and that 
" you use all the means in your power to perfect the raising of a regi- 
ment of Canadians." In fact General Montgomery had been beforehand 
with Congress in this respect, for he had said to the people, when he took 
possession of Montreal, on the 12th of November, that he " hoped to 
see such a provincial convention assembled, as would enter with zeal into 
every measure, that could contribute to set tlie civil and religious rights 
of that and her sister colonies on a permanent foundation." And he did 
not fail to use his best endeavours to induce as many Canadians as possi- 
ble to join his standard. In this, however, he was less successful, than 
some sanguine persons had anticipated. Notwithstanding appearances, 
the Canadians proved themselves nowise inclined to be conquered mto 
liberty. 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION 175 

your immediate attention; as the formation of tliat 
corps will be at a stand, until I am honored with your 
instructions thereon. 

There are two persons engaged to go to Nova Scotia, ^ /iyvLA.^ri'Ut^in^ iC 
on the business recommended in your last. By the > ^ . 

best information we have from thence, the stores have 
been withdrawn some time. Should this not be the 
case, it is next to an impossibility to attempt any thing 
there, in the present unsettled and precarious state of 
the army. 

Colonel Enos is arrived, and is under arrest ; he ac- 
knowledges, that he had no orders for coming away. 
His trial cannot come on until I hear from Colonel Ar- 
nold, from whom there is no account since I wrote you 
last. 

From what I can collect by my inquiries amongst the 
officers, it will be impossible to get the men to enlist 
for the continuance of the war, which will be an insu- 
perable obstruction to the formation of the two battal- 
ions of marines on the plan resolved on by Congress. 
As it can make no difference, I propose to proceed on 
the new arrangement of the army, and, when completed, 
inquire out such officers and men as are best qualified 
for that service, and endeavour to form these battalions 
out of the whole. This appears to me the best method, 
and I hope it will meet with the approbation of Con- 
gress. 

As it will be very difficult for the men to work, when 
the hard frost sets in, I have thought it necessary, 
though of little use at present, to take possession of 
Cobble Hill, for the benefit of any future operations. 
It was effected, without the least opposition from the 
enemy, the 23d instant. Their inactivity on this occa- 
sion I cannot account for ; it is probable they are medi- 
tating a blow somewhere. 






176 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mt.43. 

About three hundred men, women, and children of 
-ur-a^ /Kzrv^f^ the poor inhabitants of Boston, came out to Point Shir- 

fTAATt lu-u^-Y^i.' ley last Friday. They have brought their household 

i^f t cAvucia '■ ■ furniture, but are destitute of every other necessary 
'luy.AJiL -piip a>t*i*iy of life. I have recommended them to the attention 
of the committee of the Council of this province, now 
sitting at Watertown. 

The number enhsted since my last is two thousand 
five hundred and forty men. I am sorry to be necessi- 
tated to mention to you the egregious want of public 
spirit, which reigns here. Instead of pressing to be 
engaged in the cause of their country, which I vainly 
flattered myself would be the case, I find we are likely 
to be deserted in a most critical time. Those that have 
enlisted must have a furlough, which I have been 
obliged to grant to fifty at a time, from each regiment. 
The Connecticut troops, upon whom I reckoned, are as 
backward, indeed, if possible, more so than the people 
of this colony. Our situation is truly alarming; and 
of this General Howe is well apprized, it being the 
common topic of conversation, when the people left 
Boston last Friday. No doubt, when he is reinforced, 
he will avail himself of the information. 

I am making the best disposition I can for our de- 
fence, having thrown up, besides the work on Cobble 
Hill, several redoubts and half-moons along the bay; 
and I fear I shall be under the necessity of calling in 
the militia and minute-men of the country to my assist- 
ance. I say, I fear it, because, by what I can learn 
from the officers in the army belonging to this colony, 
it will be next to an impossibility to keep them under 
any degree of discipline, and it will be very difficult 
to prevail on them to remain a moment longer, than 
they themselves choose. It is a mortifying reflection, to 
be reduced to this dilemma. There has been nothing 



PartIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 177 

wanting on my part to infuse a proper spirit amongst the 
officers, that they may exert their intkience with the 
soldiery. You see, by a fortnight's recruiting amongst 
men with arms in their hands, how httie has been the 
success. 

As the smallpox is now in Boston, I have used the 
precaution of prohibiting such, as lately came out, from r' O ° 
coming near our camp. General Burgoyne, I am in- 
formed, will soon embark for England. 

You doubtless will have heard, before this reaches 
you, of General Montgomery's having got possession 
of Montreal. I congratulate you thereon. He has 
troubles with his troops, as well as I have. All I 
can learn of Colonel Arnold is, that he is near Quebec. 
I hope Montgomery will be able to proceed to his as- 
sistance. I shall be very uneasy until I hear they are 
joined. 

My best respects attend the gentlemen in Congi-ess ; 
and believe me, Sir, your most obedient, &,c. 



TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 28 November, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favors of the 15th and 17th are come to hand. 
In one of them you jusdy observe, that the sudden de- 
parture of Mr. Randolph must cause your absence to 
be the more sensibly felt. I can truly assure you, that 
I miss you exceedingly, and if an express declaration be 
wanting to hasten your return, I make it most heartily ; 
and with some pleasure, as Mr. Lynch in a letter of the 
13th gives this information. "In consequence of your 
letter by Colonel Reed, I apphed to the chief justice, .^ 

who tells me the Supreme Courts are lately held, and 

VOL. III. 23 



178 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

that it will be some time before their term will return ; 
that he knows of no capital suit now depending, and 
that it is very easy for Colonel Reed to manage matters 
so as not to let that prevent his return to you ; I am 
sure Mr. Chew is so heartily disposed to oblige you, 
and serve the cause, that nothing in his power will be 
wanting." I could wish, my good friend, that these 
things may give a spur to your inclination to return ; 
and that I may see you here as soon as convenient, for 
I feel the want of your ready pen greatly. 

What an astonishing thing it is, that those who are 
employed to sign the Continental bills should not be 
able, or inclined, to do it as fast as they are wanted. 
They will prove the destruction of the army, if they are 
not more attentive and diligent. 

Such a dearth of pubhc spirit, and such want of vir- 
tue, such stock-jobbing, and fertility in all the low arts 
^-^'''^■''^'^■'^ , ■ • to obtain advantages of one kind or another, in this 
great change of military arrangement, I never saw be- 
fore, and pray God's mercy that I may never be wit- 
ness to again. What will be the end of these ma- 
ncEuvres is beyond my scan. I tremble at the pros- 
pect. We have been till this time enlisdng about three 
thousand five hundred men. To engage these I have 
been obliged to allow furloughs as far as fifty men to a 
regiment, and the officers I am persuaded indulge as 
many more. The Connecticut troops will not be pre- 
vailed upon to stay longer than their term, saving those 
who have enlisted for the next campaign, and are mostly 
on furlough ; and such a mercenary spirit pervades the 
whole, that I should not be at all surprised at any disas- 
ter that may happen. In short, after the last of this 
month our lines will be so weakened, that the minute- 
men and milida must be called in for their defence ; and 
these, being under no kind of government themselves, 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 179 

will destroy the little subordination I have been laboring 
to establish, and run me into one evil whilst I am en- 
deavouring to avoid another ; but the less must be 
chosen. Could I have foreseen what I have experi- 
enced, and am likely to experience, no consideration upon 
earth should have induced mc to accept this command. 
A regiment or any subordinate department would have 
been accompanied with ten times the sadsfaction, and 
perhaps the honor. 

The Congress already know, from the general esti- 
mate given in for a month, what sum it will take to sup- 
ply the army ; and that litde less than tM"o hundred and 
seventy-five thousand dollars will answer the purpose. 
Pray impress this upon the members, and the necessity 
of forwarding the last sum voted, as one hundred thou- 
sand dollars will be totally inadequate to our demands 
at this time. 

I wish that matter respecting the punctilio, hinted at 
by you, could come to some decision of Congress. I 
have done nothing yet in respect to the proposed ex- 
change of prisoners, nor shall I, until I hear from them 
or you on this subject. I am sorry Mr. White met 
with a disappointment in the Jerseys ; as I could wish 
not to be under the necessity, from any former en- 
couragement given him, of taking him into my family. 
I find it is absolutely necessary that the aids to the 
Commander-in-chief should be ready at their pen, 
which I believe he is not, to render that assistance, 
which is expected of them. It would give me singular 
pleasure to provide for those two gendemen, mentioned 
in your letter ; but, believe me, it is beyond the powers 
of conception to realize the absurdities and partiality 
of these people, and the trouble and vexation I have 
had in the new arrangement of oflicers. After five, I 
think, different meetings of the general officers, I have

in a manner been obliged to yield to the humor and 
whimsies of the people, or get no army. The officers 
of one government would not serve in the regiments of 
another, although there was to be an entire new crea- 
tion ; a captain must be in this regiment, a subaltern in 
that company. In short, I can scarce tell at this mo- 
ment in what manner they are fixed. Some time 
hence strangers may be brought in ; but it could not be 
done now, except in an instance or two, without putting 
too much to hazard. 

What can your brethren of the law mean, by saying 
your perquisites as secretary must be considerable ? I 
am sure they have not amounted to one farthing. Cap- 
tain Blewer waits, and therefore I shall add no more 
than that I am, dear Sir, your most obedient and af- 
fectionate servant. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

if Cambridge, 28 November, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 
You may easily conceive, that I had great pleasure 
in perusing your letter of the 18th instant, which, with 
the enclosures, I received last evening. It was much 
damped by my finding General Montgomery had the 
same difficulty to encounter, with the troops under your 
command, that I have with those here.* No troops 

* General Montgomery wrote as follows to General Schuyler, the day 
after the capitulation of Montreal. 

" I am exceedingly sorry that Congress have not favored me with a 
committee. It would have had great effect with the troops, who are 
exceedingly turbulent and even mutinous. My vexation and distress can 
only be alleviated by reflecting on tlie great public advantages, which 
must arise from my unparalleled good fortune. I shall clothe the troops 
completely, who engage again. I find with pleasure, that my politics 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 181 

were ever better provided, or higher paid ; yet their 
backvi-ardness to enlist for another year is amazing. It 
grieves me to see so little of that patriotic spirit, which 
I was taught to believe was characteristic of this people. 

Colonel Enos, who had the command of Arnold's 
rear division, is returned with the greater part of his 
men, which must weaken him so much, as to render 
him incapable of making a successful attack on Quebec, 
without assistance from General Montgomery. I hope 
he will be able to give it him, and, by taking that city, 
finish his glorious campaign. I have nothing material to 
communicate to you. I am making every disposition 
for defence, by throwing up redoubts along the Bay ; 
some of which have been constructed under the ene- 
my's guns, but they have not given us the least disturb- 
ance. 

I suppose Mr. Howe waits the arrival of his rein- 
forcements, when probably he will attempt something. 
He sent out about three hundred men, women, and 
children last week. They give shocking accounts of the 
want of fuel and fresh provisions. General Burgoyne 



have squared with the views of Congress, and shall lose no time in call- 
ing a convention, when my intended expedition is finished. Will not 
your health permit you to reside at Montreal this winter .' I must go 
home, if I walk by the side of the lake, this winter. I am weary of 
power, and totally want that patience and temper, so requisite for such a 
command. I wish some method could be fallen upon of engaging gentle- 
men to serve. A point of honor, and more knowledge of the world to 
be found in that class of men, would greatly reform discipline and ren- 
der the troops much more tractable. 

" The officers of the first regiment of Yorkers and artillery company 
were very near a mutiny the other day, because I would not stop the 
clothing of the garrison of St. John's. I would not have sullied my own 
reputation, nor disgraced the Continental arms, by such a breach of ca- 
pitulation, for the universe. There was no driving it into their heads, 
that the clothing was really the property of the soldier ; that he had paid 
for it ; and that every regiment, in this country especially, saved a year's 
clothing to have decent clothes to wear on particular occasions."

agreeable account oi' one of our armed schooners hav- 
ing taken a large brigantine, laden with military stores, the 
inventory of which I have the pleasure to enclose. But 
let not this acquisition prevent your sending what stores 
you can spare. We shall want them all. Adieu, my

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 
J H-t^ t- . '^*^^ Cambridge, 2 December, 1775. 

Sir, 

The reason of my giving you the trouble of this, is 
the late extraordinary and reprehensible conduct of 
some of the Connecticut troops. Some time ago, 
apprehending that some of them might incline to go 
home, when the time of their enlistment should be up, 
I applied to the officers of the several regiments, to 
know whether it would be agreeable to the men to con- 
tinue until the 1st of January, or until a sufficient 
number of other forces could be raised to supply their 
place, who informed me, that they believed the whole 
of them would readily stay, till that could be effected. 
Having discovered last week, that they were very un- 
easy to leave the service, and determined upon it, I 
though it expedient to summon the general officers at 
head -quarters, and invite a delegation of the General 
^} PeUi.i.iAJ^ *vv «U Court' to be present, that suitable measures might be 
P " adopted for the defence and support of our lines. The 

* result was, that three thousand of the minute-men and 

■ militia of this province, and two thousand men from 
New Hampshire, should be called in, by the 10th in- 
stant, for that purpose. With this determination the 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 183 

Connecticut troops were made acquainted, and re- 
quested and ordered to remain here, as the time of 
most of them would not be out before the 10th, when 
they would be relieved. Notwithstanding this, yester- 
day morning most of them resolved to leave the camp. 
Many went off, and the utmost vigilance and industry 
were used to apprehend them. Several got away with 
their arms and ammunition. I have enclosed you a list 
of the names of some of them in General Putnam's 
regiment only, who escaped, and submit to your judg- 
ment, whether an example should not be made of 
these men, who have basely deserted the cause of their 
country at this critical juncture, when the enemy are 
receiving reinforcements. 

I have the pleasure to inform you, that one of our 
armed vessels, the Lee, Captain Manly, took and 
brought in the other day a valuable store-ship bound to 
Boston. I am, &c.* 

* Governor Trumbull wrote in reply ; — " The late extraordinary and 
reprehensible conduct of some of the troops of this colony impresses 
me, and the minds of many of our people, with grief, surprise, and in- 
dignation ; since the treatment they met with, and the order and request 
made to them, were so reasonable, and apparently necessary for the de- 
fence of our common cause, and safety of our rights and privileges, for 
which they freely engaged ; the term they voluntarily enlisted to ser\'e 
not expired, and probably would not end mucli before the time when 
they would be relieved, provided their circumstances and inclination should 
prevent their undertaking further. 

" Indeed, there is great difficulty to support liberty, to exercise govern- 
ment, to maintain subordination, and at the same time to prevent the 
operation of licentious and levelling principles, which many very easily 
imbibe. The pulse of a New England man beats high for liberty ; his 
engagement in the service he thinks purely voluntary ; therefore, when 
the time of enlistment is out, lie thinks himself not holden without fur- 
ther engagement. This was the case in the last war. I greatly fear 
its operation amongst the soldiers of the other colonies, as I am sensible 
this is the genius and spirit of our people. The union of the colonies, 
and the internal union of each, are of the utmost importance. I 
determine to call the General Assembly of this colony to meet at 
New Haven on Thursday, the ]4th instant. Please to notify me of any

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Cambridge, 4 December, 1775. 



y 



Sir, 

It is some time since I recommended to the Con- 
gress, that they would institute a court for the trial of 
prizes made by the Continental armed vessels, which I 
hope they have ere now taken into their consideration ; 
otherwise I should again take the liberty of urging it in 
the most pressing manner. 

The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut 
troops has laid me under the necessity of calling in a 
body of the militia, much sooner than I apprehended 
there would be an occasion for such a step. I was 
afraid some time ago, that they would incline to go 
home when the time of their enlistment expired. I 
called upon the officers of the several regiments, to 
know whether they could prevail on the men to remain 
until the 1st of January, or till a sufficient number of 
other forces could be raised to supply their place. I 
suppose they were themselves deceived. I know they 
deceived me by assurances, that I need be under no 
apprehension on that score, for the men would not 
leave the lines. Last Friday showed how much they 
were mistaken, as the major part of the troops of 
that colony were going away with their arms and am- 
munition. We have, however, by threats, persuasions, 
and the activity of the people of the country, who sent 
back many of them, that had set out, prevailed upon 



matters you think proper to suggest for consideration. You may depend 
on their zeal and ardor to support the common cause, to furnish our 
quota, and to exert their utmost strength for the defence of the rights of 
these colonies. Your candor and goodness will suggest to your con- 
sideration, that the conduct of our troops is not a rule whereby to judge 
of the temper and spirit of the colony." 



PartIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 185 

the larger part to stay. There are about eighty of 
them missing. 

I have called in three thousand men from this prov- 
ince ; and General Sullivan, who lately returned from 
the province of New Hampshire, having informed me 
that a number of men were there ready at the shortest 
notice, I have demanded two thousand from that prov- 
ince. These two bodies, I expect, will be in by the 
tenth instant, to make up the deficiency of the Con- 
necticut men, whom I have promised to dismiss on that 
day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to 
grant furloughs before any would enlist. As the same 
defection is much to be apprehended, when the time of 
the Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, and Rhode 
Island forces is expired, I beg the attention of Congress 
to this important affair.* 

I am informed, that it has been the custom of these 
provinces in the last war, for the legislative power to 
order every town to provide a certain quota of men for 
the campaign. This, or some other mode, should be 
at present adopted, as I am satisfied the men cannot be 
had without it. This the Congress will please to take 
into their immediate consideration. My suspicions on 

* Mr. Lynch, who had been one of the committee of conference in camp, 
wrote to General Washington, after returning to Congress, in regard to 
the state of the army here described ; — • 

" Providence favors us every where ; our success in every operation 
exceeds our most sanguine expectations ; and yet, when God is ready to 
deliver our oppressors into our hands, that men cannot be found willing to 
receive them, is truly surprising. With grief and shame it must be con- 
fessed, that the whole blame lies not with the army. You will find your 
hands straitened instead of strengthened. What the event will be, it ia 
impossible to foresee ; perhaps it is only intended to force the continent 
into their own terms, and to sliow tliat neither General nor Congress shall 
be permitted to control the army ; perhaps to mortify the favorites of Con- 
gress. Be this as it may, resolution and firmness ought to rule our 
councils. A step yielded to improper and intemperate demands may be 
irretrievable."

this head I shall also communicate to the Governors 
Trumbull and Cooke, also to the New Hampshire Con- 
vention. 

The number enlisted in the last week is about thir- 
teen hundred men. By this you see how slow this im- 
portant work goes on. Enclosed is a letter written to 
me by General Putnam, recommending Colonel Babcock 
to the brigadier-generalship now vacant in this army. I 
know nothing of this gentleman, but I wish the vacancy 
were filled, as the want of one is attended with very 
great inconveniences. An express is just come in from 
General Schuyler, with letters from Colonel Arnold and 
General Montgomery, copies of which I have the honor 
to enclose. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a 
pleasing aspect in that quarter. The reduction of Que- 
bec is an object of such great importance, that I doubt 
not the Congress will give every assistance in their 
power for the accomphshing of it this winter. * 

» General Howe wrote to Lord Dartmouth, on the 3d of December, 
communicating intelligence of the loss of St. John's and Montreal, and 
the retreat of General Carleton to Quebec, and e.xpressing apprehen- 
sions that the entire province would fall into the hands of the invaders, 
as there was little reason to believe the capital would be able to with- 
stand the e.xpected attack. He added, also, that, supposing it possible 
the Americans might be encouraged by their successes in Canada, and 
the arms recently taken in the brigantine Nancy, and think of a project 
against Halifax, lie should immediately send a reinforcement to that place. 
As the recovery of Canada was a primary object, lie recommended that 
the army for effecting it should consist of not less than twelve thousand 
fighting men, representing at the same time tlie inexpediency of abandon- 
ino- the plan heretofore suggested of taking possession of Rhode Island 
and New York, since the enemy would be more distressed by an attack 
on this vulnerable side, than by any successes against them in Canada. 
— MS. Letter. 

The following intelligence was contained in a letter from General Howe, 
forwarded at the same tune as the above. " The enclosed are original 
letters found in Mr. Cushing's house. They are from Dr. Franklin and 
Mr. Stephen Sayre, and of a nature that points out the train carried on by 
these gentlemen to blow up this country into a rebellion." 

The troops in Boston suffered much for want of fuel. The following

By the last accounts from the armed schooners sent 
to the River St. Lawrence, I fear we have but little to 
expect from them. They were falling short of pro- 
vision, and mentioned that they would be obliged to 
return; which at this time is particularly unfortunate, 
as, if they chose a proper station, all the vessels coming 
down that river must fall into their hands. The plague, 
trouble, and vexation I have had with the crews of all 
the armed vessels, are inexpressible. I do believe there 
is not on earth a more disorderly set. Every time they 
come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous com- 
plaints. Manly's success has lately, and but lately, 
quieted his people. The crews of the Washington and (»/_ 'ixr^ t ^^6 
Harrison have actually deserted them ; so that I have ' 

been under the necessity of ordering the agent to lay 
..^ the latter up, and get hands for the other on the best 
qJ^ » < terms he could. 

The House of Representadves and the honorable 
Board have sent me a vote of theirs relative to the har- 
bour of Cape Cod, which you have herewith. I shall 
send an officer thither to examine what can be done for 
its defence, though I do not think I shall be able to give 
them such assistance as may be requisite ; for I have at 
present neither men, powder, nor cannon to spare. 
The great want of powder is what the attendon of 
Congress should be parUcularly applied to. I dare not 
attempt any thing offensive, let the temptation or ad- 
vantage be ever so great, as I have not more of that 



extraordinary order will show, that the destruction of houses to supply 
this want was far from being approved by the British commander. 

" The frequent depredations committed by the soldiers in pulling down 
houses and fences, in defiance of repeated orders, have induced the Com- 
mander-in-chief to direct the Provost to go his rounds attended by the 
executioners, with orders to hang up, upon the spot, the first man he shall 
detect in tlie fact, witliout waiting for further proof by trial." — General

most essential article, than will be absolutely necessary 
to defend our lines, should the enemy attempt to attack 
them. 

Bv recent uilbrmation from Boston, General Howe is 
sjoinsi to send out a ntmiber of the inhabitants, in order, 
it is thought, to make more room for his expected rein- 
forcements. There is one part of the information I can 
hardlv give credit to. A sailor says, that a ntmiber of 
those comins out have been inoculated, with the design 
of spreading the smallpox through this country and 
camp. I have commimicated this to the General Court, 
and recommended their attention thereto. They are 
armmg one of the transports in Boston, with which 
thev mean to decoy some of our armed vessels. As 
we are apprized of their design, I hope they will be 
disappointed. My best respects wait on the gendemen

Sir, 
I have of late met with abimdant reason to be con- 
vinced of the impracticabUitA- of recruiting this army to 
the new establishment, in any reasonable time by volim- 
tarv enUstments, The causes of such exceeding great 
hikeAvarmness I shall not attempt to point out ; sufficient 
it is to know, that the tact is sa Many reasons are 
assigned ; one only shall I mention, and that is, that the 
present soldierv are in expectation of drawing from the 
landed interest and farmers a bounty, equal to that given 
at the commencement of this army, and therefore they 
keep aloof. Be this as it may, I am satisfied that this is 
not a time for trifling, and that the exigency of our af- 
fairs calls aloud for ^isorous exenions. 



PariIL] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1S9 

By sad experience it b Ibund, that the Connecticut 
regiments have deserted, and are about to desert, the 
noble cause we are engaged in. Nor have I anr reason 
to believe, ihai the forces oi Xew Hampshire, this sov- 
emmeni, or Rhode Island, will give stronger proofs o( 
their attachment to it, when the period arrives that thev 
may claim their dismission. For after everv stimuhis 
in my power to throw in their way. and near a month's 
dose endeavour, we have enlisied men, of whom one 
thousand five hundred at a time are to be absent on 
fiiriough, until ail have gone home to visit and provide 
lor their families. 

Five thousand mffiria. from this government and the 
colony of Xew Hampshire, are ordered to be at this 
place by the 10th instant, to refieve the Connecticut 
regiments and supply the deficiency, which will be 
occasioned by their depamire and the absence of those 
on fiiriougL These men, I have been told by officers, 
who were eyewitnesses to their behaviour, are not to be 
depended upon for more than a few davs ; as thev soon 
get tired, grow impatient and ungovernable, and of course 
leave the service. What will be the consequences, then, 
if the greatest part of the army is to be composed of such 
men? Upon the new establishment twenrv-six res^i- 
ments were ordered to be raised, besides those of the 
artillery and riflemen ; of these Xew Hampshire has 
three, Massachusetts sixteen, Rhode Island two, and 
Connecticut five. A mode of appointing the officers 
was also recommended, and as stricdy adhered to as 
circimistances would admit. These officers are now 
recruiting, with the success I have mentioned. 

Thus, Sir, have I given you a true and impartial state 
of our situation, and submit it to the wisdom of vour 
and the other three Xew England colonies, whether

public, which Congress have declared against, thinking 
the terms, exclusive thereof, greater than ever soldiers 
had before. I have, by this conveyance, laid the matter

Cambridge, 5 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 
Your much esteemed favor of the 22d ultimo, cover- 
ing Colonel Arnold's letter, with a copy of one to 
General Montgomery and his to you, I received yester- 
day morning. It gave me the highest satisfaction to 
hear of Colonel Arnold's being at Point Levi, with his 
men in great spirits, after their long and fatiguing march, 
attended with almost insuperable difficulties, and the 
discouraging circumstance of being left by near one 
third of the troops, that went on the expedition. The 
merit of this gendeman is certainly great, and I heartily 

* At this time the army at Cambridge was suffering much distress for 
the want of firewood and hay. The Assembly of Massachusetts under- 
took to supply these articles, by calling on the towns witliin twenty miles 
of Boston, to furnish at stated times specific quantities, according to the 
population of each town, and its distance from camp. This requisition 
was generally complied with by the selectmen and committees of the 
towns, although it was issued only in the form of a recommendation, and 
the wants of the army were effectually relieved. These supplies were 
furnished at tlie charge of the colony. A committee of the Assembly 
was likewise authorized to procure wood from such woodlands as they 
thought proper, even without the consent of the owner, a reasonable price 
being paid for the wood thus taken away. — Journal of the Assembly, De-

wish, that fortune may distinguish him as one of her 
favorites. I am convinced, that he will do every thing 
that prudence and valor shall suggest, to add to the 
success of our arms and for reducing Quebec to our 
possession. Should he not be able to accomphsh so 
desirable a work with the forces he has, I flatter myself, 
that it will be effected when General Montgomery joins 
him, and our conquest of Canada be complete. 

I am exceedingly sorry to find you so much plagued 
and embarrassed by the disregard of discipline, con- 
fusion, and want of order among the troops, as to have 
occasioned you to mention to Congress an inclination to 
retire. I know that your complaints are too well 
founded ; but I would willingly hope, that nothing will 
induce you to quit the service, and that, in time, order 
and subordination will take place of confusion, and 
command be rendered more agreeable. I have met 
with difficulties of the same sort, and such as I never 
expected ; but they must be borne with. The cause 
we are engaged in is so just and righteous, that we 
must try to rise superior to every obstacle in its sup- 
port ; and, therefore, I beg that you will not think of 
resigning, unless you have carried your application to 
Congress too far to recede. I am, dear Sir, with great 
esteem and regard, yours, &c.* 

* General Schuyler had written in the letter to which this is a reply ; 

" Notliing can surpass the impatience of the troops from the New Eng- 
land colonies to get to their firesides. Near three hundred of them 
arrived a few days ago, unable to do any duty ; but as soon as I adminis- 
tered that grand specific, a discharge, they instantly acquired health, and 
rather than be detained a few days to cross Lake George, they undertook 
a march from here of two hundred miles with the greatest alacrity. 

" Our army requires to be put on a different footing. Habituated to 
order, I cannot, without the most extreme pain, see that disregard of disci- 
pline, confusion, and inattention, which reign so generally in this quarter, 
and I am therefore determined to retire. Of this resolution I have advised 
Congress."

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 8th ultimo, with a postscript of 

the 14th from Point Levi, I have had the pleasure to re- 

^ j ceive. It is not in the power of any man to command 

NivA 4 , , vv^ j success, but you have done more, you have deserved 

•-*<^ Aav*-K/ ^ it ; and before this time I hope you will have met with 

|L c /. <vv^ ?wk^ the laurels, which are due to your toils, in the possession 

/(fc/je -OAXj^ . °'' Quebec. My thanks are due, and sincerely offered 

to you, for your enterprising and persevering spirit. To 
your brave followers I likewise present them. I was 
not unmindful of you, or them, in the establishment of 
a new army. One out of twenty-six regiments (lately 
General Putnam's) you are appointed to the command 
of, and I have ordered all the officers with you to 
one or another of these regiments, in the rank they 
now bear, that in case they choose to continue in ser- 
vice, and no appointments take place where they now 
are, no disappointment may follow. 

Nothing very material has happened in this camp 
since you left it. Finding we were not likely to do 
much in the land way, I fitted out several privateers, or 
rather armed vessels, in behalf of the continent, with 
which we have taken several prizes to the amount, it is 
supposed, of fifteen thousand pounds sterling. One of 
them, a valuable store-ship, but with no powder in it, 
contained a fine brass thirteen-inch mortar, two thousand 
stand of arms, shot, and other articles. 

I have no doubt but a junction of your detachment 
with the army under General Montgomery is effected 
before this. If so, you will put yourself under his com- 
mand, and will, I am persuaded, give him all the assist- 
ance in your power, to finish the glorious work you 



Part 11.1 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 193 

have begun. 'J'hat the Ahiiighty may preserve and 
prosper you in it, is the sincere and fervent prayer olj 
dear Sir, &.c. 

P. S. You could not be more surprised than I was, 
at Enos's return with tlie division under his command. 
I immediately put him under arrest, and had him tried 
for quitting the detachment without your orders. He is 
acquitted on the score of provisions. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. rVvi^ 

Cambridge, 7 December, 1775. 

Sir, 
I wrote to you, the 4th instant, by express, to which I 
beg you will be referred. My fears, that Broughton 
and Selman would not etiect any good purpose, were 
too well founded. They are returned, and brought 
with them three of the principal inhabitants from the 
island of St. John's. Mr. Callbeck, as president of the 
council, acted as governor. They brought the gover- 
nor's commission and the Province seal. As the cap- 
tains acted without any warrant for such conduct, I have 
thought it but justice to discharge these gentlemen, 
whose families were left in the utmost distress.* 

* Broughton and Selman commanded the two armed vessels heretofore 
mentioned, that had been despatched by Washington, in compliance with 
an order of Congress, to intercept in the River St. Lawrence two brigan- 
tines, which, it had been understood, were to sail from England to Que- 
bec, laden with arms and ammunition, and without convoy. After a 
cruise of several days, the American captains discovered no such vessels, 
but they committed a very unjustifiable act in making a descent on the 
island of St. .John's, pillaging the defenceless inhabitants, and bringing 
away some of them prisoners. The gentlemen thus brought off, among 
whom was Mr. Callbeck, presented a memorial to General Washington, 
in which they stated, that the governor's house and other private dwellings

actually in arms against us, being captain of the Scotch

Captain Manly, of the Lee armed schooner, has taken 
and sent into Beverly two prizes since I wrote you last, 
which was the 7th instant. One of them is the ship 
Jenny, Captain Foster, who left London late in October. 
He has very unfortunately thrown all his papers over- 



were broken open, and robbed of their plate, carpets, curtains, looking- 
glasses, table linen, wearing apparel, and whatever else was of value and 
could be taken away. This was done by the captains, of course, witliout a 
shadow of licence from their instructions, though apparently rather through 
ignorance of the customary rules of warfare, than by any conscious viola- 
tion of the laws of equity and honor. Such conduct, however, could not 
fail to excite the indignation of the Commander-in-chief, and he released 
the captives inmiediately, treating them with all possible kindness and 
respect. Orders were given for restoring the goods, wliich had been 
pillaged, and from tlie following note, written by Mr. Callbeck, it may be 
presumed, tliat he at least was satisfied. 

" I should ill deserve the generous treatment, which your Excellency 
has been pleased to show me, had I not gratitude to acknowledge so great 
a favor. I cannot ascribe any part of it to my own merit, but must impute 
the whole to the philantliropy and humane disposition, that so truly charac- 
terize General Washington. Be so obliging, therefore, as to accept the 
only return in my power, that of my most grateful thanks."

board, and is not yet arrived at camp. His vessel is 
loaded with coal and porter ; of the latter he has about 
one hundred butts. The other is a brigantine from 
Antigua, called the Little Hannah, Robert Adams 
master. Her cargo consists of one hundred and thirty- 
nine hogsheads of rum, one hundred cases of Geneva, 
and some other trifling articles. Both cargoes were for 
the army and navy at Boston. I have great pleasure in 
congratulating you on this business. 

The numbers enlisted last week are men. 

If they go on at this slow rate, it will be a long time 
before this army is complete. I have written to the 
Governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, also to the 
Convention of New Hampshire, on this subject. A 
copy of my letter to them I have the honor to enclose 
herewith. A letter to the same purport I sent to the 
legislature of this province. 

The militia are coming in fast. I am much pleased 
with the alacrity, which the good people of this province, 
as well as those of New Hampshire, have shown upon 
this occasion. I expect the whole will be in this day 
and to-morrow, when what remains of the Connecticut 
gentry, who have not enhsted, will have liberty to go to 
their firesides. The information I received, that the ^ ^|^ 
enemy intended spreading the smallpox amongst us, I 
could not suppose them capable of. I now must give 
some credit to it, as it has made its appearance on 
several of those, who last came out of Boston. Every 
necessary precaution has been taken to prevent its 
being communicated to this army ; and the General 
Court will take care, that it does not spread through 
the country. 

I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at 
Boston ; which is a lucky circumstance, as the Con- 
necticut troops, I now find, are for the most part gone

Uiey are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent 
the effects of fire, should we attempt a bombardment 
or an attack upon the town. Cobble Hill is strongly 
fortified, without any interruption from the enemy. 

Colonel Enos has been tried and acquitted ; upon 
what principle you will see by the process of his trial, 
which I now send you. As the time of Colonel Enos's 
engagement was near expired, a doubt arose whether 
he could then be tried by a court-martial. This it was, 
which occasioned his trial to come on before Colonel 
Arnold's evidence could be had. I am, &lc.*

* Mrs. Washington arrived in camp from Virginia on tlie 1 Itli of De- 
cember, accompanied by her son, Mr. Custis, and his wife. As the Gene- 
ral coidd not leave the army, he had requested Mrs. Washington to pass the 
winter with him at Cambridge. It seems, that some persons thought her in 
danger at Mount Vernon, which stands on the bank of the Potomac River, 
and is accessible to armed ships of the largest size. Lund Washington 
had written to the General ; — " Many people have made a stir about Sirs. 
Washington's continuing at Mount Vernon, but I cannot tliink there is 
any danger. The thought I believe originated in Alexandria; from 
thence it got to Loudoun, and I am told the people of Loudoun talk of 
sending a guard to conduct her up to Berkeley, with some of their principal 
men to persuade her to leave this place and accept their offer. Mr. John 
Augustine Washington wrote, pressing her to leave Mount Vernon. She 
does not believe herself in danger. Lord Dunmore will hardly himself 
venture up tliis river; nor do I believe he will send on that errand. Sure- 
ly her old acquaintance, the attorney, who, witli his tiimily, is on board his 
ship, would prevent his doing an act of that kind. You may depend I 
will be watchful, and upon the least alarm persuade her to remove."

vessels only want a court established for trial, to make 
them complete. This, I hope, will be soon done, as I 
have taken the hberty to urge it often to the Congress. 

I am somewhat at a loss to know whether I am to 
raise the two battalions of marines here or not. As the 
delay can be attended with but litde inconvenience, I 
will wait a farther explanation from Congress, before 
I take any steps therein. I am much pleased that 
the money will be forwarded with all possible expedi- 
tion, as it is much wanted ; also that Connolly and his 
associates are taken. It has been a very fortunate dis- 
covery. I make no doubt, but that the Congress will 
take every necessary measure to dispossess Lord Dun- 
more of his hold in Virginia. The sooner steps are 
.aken for that purpose, the more probability there will 
be of their being effectual. I hope Colonel Knox will 
soon finish the business he is upon, and appear here to 
take the honorable command conferred on him by Con- 
gress. * I will make application to General Howe, and 
propose an exchange for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much 
afraid I shall have a like proposal to make for Captain 
Martindale and his men, of the armed brigantine Wash- > 
ington, which, it is reported, was taken a few days past /* '^' ^ 
by a man-of-war, and carried into Boston. We cannot 
expect to be always successful. You will doubdess

over the town. Such of the military, as had it not be-

a weapon of defence they are using against us. What

that they are tearing up the pavement, to be provided

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Cambridge, 15 December, 1775. 

Sir, 

Your favors of the 7th and 9th instant I received, 
and was much pleased to hear of the zeal of the people 
of Connecticut, and the readiness of the inhabitants of 
the several towns to march to this camp, upon their 
being acquainted with the behaviour and desertion of 
their troops. I have nothing to suggest for the con- 
sideration of your Assembly. I am confident they will 
not be wanting in their exertions for supporting the just 
and constitutional rights of the colonies. 

Enclosed I send you a list of the officers and compa- 
nies under the new establishment, with the number of 
the men enUsted ; the returns only came in to-day, or 
I would have transmitted it before. 

Having heard that it is doubtful whether the Rever- 
end Mr. Leonard, from your colony, will have it in his

power to continue here as a Chaplain, I cannot but ex- 
press some concern, as I think his departure will be a 
loss. His general conduct has been exemplary and 
praiseworthy; in discharging the duties of his office, 
active and industrious; he has discovered himself a 
warm and steady friend to his country, and taken great 
pains to animate the soldiers, and impress them with a 
knowledge of the important rights we are contending 
for. Upon the late desertion of the troops, he gave a 
sensible and judicious discourse, holding forth the 
necessity of courage and bravery, and at the same time 
of obedience and subordination to those in command. 

In justice to the merits of this gentleman, I thought 
it only right to give you this testimonial of my opinion 
of him, and to mention him to you, as a person worthy 
of your esteem and that of the public. I am. Sir, &c. 



TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 15 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last, I have had the pleasure of receiving 
your favors of the 28th ultimo, and the 2d instant. I 
must again express my gratitude for the attention shown 
to Mrs. Washington at Philadelphia. It cannot but be 
pleasing, although it did, in some measure, impede the 
progress of her journey. 

I am much obliged to you for the hints contained in A)^ /- "^ 

both of the above letters, respecting the jealousies 
which you say are gone abroad. I have studiously 
avoided in all letters calculated for the public eye, I mean 
for that of the Congress, every expression that could 
give pain or uneasiness ; and I shall observe the same 
rule with respect to private letters, any further than

appears absolutely necessary for the elucidation of facts. 
I cannot charge myself with incivility, or, what in my 
opinion is tantamount, ceremonious civility, to the gen- 
tlemen of this colony ; but if such my conduct appears, 
I will endeavour at a reformation, as I can assure you, 
my dear Reed, that I wish to walk in such a line as will 
give most general satisfaction. You know, that it was 
my wish at first to invite a certain number of the gentle- 
men of this colony every day to dinner,* but uninten- 
tionally we some how or other missed of it. If this has 
given rise to the jealousy, I can only say that I am 
sorry for it ; at the same time I add, that it was rather 
owing to inattention, or, more properly, too much atten- 
tion to other matters, which caused me to neglect it. 
The extracts of letters from this camp, which so fre- 
quently appear in the Pennsylvania papers, are not only 
written widiout my knowledge, but without my appro- 
bation, as I have always thought they must have an un- 
favorable tendency ; but there is no restraining men's 
tongues, or pens, when charged with a little vanity, as 
in the accounts given of, or rather by, the riflemen. 

With respect to what you have said of yourself, and 
your situation, I can only add to what I have before said 
on this subject, that whilst you leave the door open to my 
expectation of your return, I shall not think of supply- 
ing your place. If ultimately you resolve against com- 
ing, I should be glad to know it, as soon as you have 
determined. The Congress have resolved well in 
respect to the pay of the men ; but if they cannot get 
the money-signers to despatch their business, it is of 
very litde avail ; for we have not at this time money 
enough in camp to answer the commissary's and quar- 
ter-master's accounts, much less to pay the troops. 

* General Washington's head-quarters were but two miles from Water- 
town, where the General Court of Massachusetts assembled. 



Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 201 

The account, which you have given of the sentiments 
of the people respecting my conduct, is extremely flat- 
tering. I pray God, that I may continue to deserve 
them, in my perplexed and intricate situation. 

Our enlistment goes on slowly. By the returns last 
Monday, only five thousand nine hundred and seventeen 
men are engaged for the ensuing campaign ; and yet we 
are told, that we shall get the number wanted, as they 
are only playing ofl" to see what advantages are to be 
made, and whether a bounty cannot be extorted either 
from the public at large, or individuals, in case of a draft. 
Time only can discover this. I doubt the measure ex- 
ceedingly. The fortunate capture of the store-ship has 
supplied us with flints, and many other articles we stood 
in need of; but we still have our wants. I am, &c. 



TO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL HOWE. 

Camp at Cambridge, 18 December, 1775. 

Sir, 

We have just been informed of a circumstance, which, 
were it not so well authenticated, I should scarcely 
think credible. It is that Colonel Allen, who, with his 
small party, was defeated and taken prisoner near Mont- 
real, has been treated without regard to decency, hu- 
manity, or the rules of w^ar ; that he has been thrown 
into irons, and suff"ers all the hardships inflicted upon 
common felons. 

I think it my duty, Sir, to demand, and do expect from 
you, an eclaircissement on this subject. At the same time, 
I flatter myself, from the character which Mr. Howe 
bears, as a man of honor, gentleman, and soldier, that 
my demand will meet with his approbation. I must 
take the liberty, also, of informing you, that I shall con- 

VOL. III. 26 



■h 



202 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 43. 

sider your silence as a confirmation of the report ; and 
further assuring you, that, whatever treatment Colonel 
Allen receives, whatever fate he undergoes, such ex- 
actly shall be the treatment and fate of Brigadier Pres- 
cott, now in our hands. * The law of retaliation is 
not only justifiable in the eyes of God and man, 
but absolutely a duty, which, in our present circum- 
stances, we owe to our relations, friends, and fellow- 
citizens. 

Permit me to add, Sir, that we have all here the high- 
est regard and reverence for your great personal quali- 
ties and attainments, and that the Americans in general 
esteem it as not the least of their misfortunes, that the 
name of Howe, a name so dear to them,t should appear 
at the head of the catalogue of the instruments em- 
ployed by a wicked ministry for their destruction. 

With due respect, I have the honor to be. Sir, your 
most obedient humble servant. 



* When Ethan Allen was captured at Montreal, lie was taken before 
the British General, Prescott, who treated liim not only with extreme 
rudeness, but cruelty. Allen writes, tliat, after receiving from him much 
personal abuse, " he ordered one of his officers to take me on board the 
Gaspee, schooner of war, and confine me, hands and feet, in irons, which 
was done the same afternoon I was taken." — JS/arrative, &c. p. 26. The 
account of this treatment was confirmed to General Montgomery, after he 
had taken Montreal ; and when General Prescott fell into his hands, he gave 
notice to General Schuyler of his previous conduct. This intelligence 
reached Congress and General Washington, and caused the above letter 
to General Howe. It was a just retribution, therefore, that Prescott should 
be made to feel the severity and indignities, which he was capable of prac- 
tising upon a soldier and a brave man. " He was for a time imprisoned in a 
jail at Philadelphia by order of Congress, but was released from confine- 
ment in consequence of ill health.

in the last war at the attack on Ticonderoga under General Abercromby. 
He was an officer of great merit, and extremely popular in the colonies.

memory in Westminster Abbey. — Hutchinson's History of Massachusetts,

" Boston, 93 December, 1775. 

. " Sir, 

"In answer to your letter of the 18th instant, I am to acquaint you, that 
my command does not extend to Canada. Not having received any ac- 
counts wherein the name of AUen is mentioned, I cannot give you the 
smallest satisfaction upon the subject of your letter. But trusting Major- 
General Carleton's conduct will never incur censure upon any occasion, I 
am to conclude in the instance of your inquiry, that he has not forfeited 
his past pretensions to decency and humanity. 

" It is with regret, considering tlie character you have always main- 
tained among your friends, as a gentleman of the strictest honor and deli- 
cacy, that I find cause to resent a sentence in the conclusion of your 
letter, big with invective against my superiors, and insulting to myself, 
which should obstruct any further intercourse between us.

The day after receiving Washmgton's letter, that is, on the 19th of De- 
cember, General Howe wrote to Lord Dartmouth as foUows. 

" Mr. Washington, presuming upon the number and rank of the prison- 
ers in his possession, has threatened retaliation in point of treatment to 
any prisoners of theirs in our power; and proposes an exchange, which is

with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in 
Boston. The packets of letters found on board, I have 
the honor to send you with this by Captain James 
Chambers, they being of so much importance, that I do 
not think it would be prudent to trust them by a com- 
mon express. As Lord Dunmore's schemes are fully 
j^fi-i-wf ^^tc-tvvi laid open in these letters, I need not point out to the 
3»,t^, Congress the necessity there is of a vigorous exertion 

being made by them, to dispossess his Lordship of 
the strong-hold he has got in Virginia. I do not mean 
to dictate, but I am sure they will pardon me for giving 
them freely my opinion, which is, that the fate of Amer- 
ica a good deal depends on his being obliged to evacu- 
ate Norfolk this winter or not. 

I have Kirkland well secured, and think I will send 
him to you for examination. By most of the letters 
relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stew- ^ ^'o 
art's letters and papers are of a very interesting nature. 

a circumstance I shall not answer in positive terms ; nor shall I enter upon 
such a measure without the King's orders. Your Lordship has, enclosed, a 
publication extracted fi-om tlie minutes of the Continental Congress in 
reference to liis Majesty's proclamation of tlie 23d of August, on the prin- 
ciples of which Mr. Washington seems to have founded his threats." — • 
MS. Letter. 

This proclamation declared the colonies to be in open rebellion against 
the crown, and all tlie King's officers, civil and military, were ordered to 
give information of such persons as should be found aiding or abetting 
those, who were in arms against the government, or holding any corre- 
spondence with them, "in order to bring to condign punishment the au- 
thors, perpetrators, and abettors of such traitorous designs." After con- 
sidering this proclamation, the Congress declared and published, " that 
whatever punishment shall be inflicted upon any persons in the power of 
our enemies for favoring, aiding, or abetting the cause of American lib- 
erty, shall be retaliated in the same kind and the same degree upon those 
in our power, who have favored, aided, or abetted, or shall favor, aid, or 
abet the system of ministerial oppression. The essential difference be- 
tween our cause, and that of our enemies, might justify a severer punish- 
ment ; the law of retaliation will unquestionably warrant one equally 
severe." — Remembrnncer, Vol. I. p. 148. — Jourruds of Congress, Decem- 
ber 6th, 1775.

Governor Tonyu's and many other letters from St. Au- 
gustine show the weakness of the place ; at the same 
time, of what vast consequence it would be for us to pos- 
sess ourselves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition 
contained in the forts. Indeed these papers are of so 
great consequence, that I think this but little inferior to 
any prize our famous Manly has taken. 

We now work at our ease on Lechmere's Hill. On 
discovering our party there yesterday morning, the ship 
which lay opposite began a cannonade, to which Mount 
Horam* added some shells. One of our men was 
wounded. We fired a few shot from two eighteen 
pounders, which are placed on Cobble Hill, and soon 
obliged the ship to shift her station. She now hes in 
the ferry-way ; and, except a few shells from the mount 
in Boston, which do no execution, we have no interrup- 
tion in pi-osecuting our works, which will in a very short 
time be completed. When that is done, when we 
have powder to sport with, I think, if Congress resolves 
on the execution of the proposal made relative to the 
town of Boston, that it can be done. 

I have sent a letter this day to General Howe, of 
which a copy goes herewith. My reason for pointing 
out Brigadier- General Prescott as the object, who is to 
suffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from General 
Schuyler, and copies of letters from General Montgom- 
ery to Schuyler, I am given to understand that Prescott 
is the cause of Allen's sulTerings. I thought it best to 
be decisive on the occasion, as did the generals whom I 
consulted thereon. 

The returns of men enlisted since my last amount to 
about eighteen hundred, making in the whole seven 
thousand one hundred and forty. The militia that are

with great alacrity. The de.spatch made, both by the

complying with my requisition, has given me infinite 
satisfaction. Your letter of the 8th instant, with the 
explanatory resolve respecting my calling forth the mili-

looking out for proper officers to command that corps.* 
I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay 
off the arrears and the month's advance, that it will be 
a great encouragement for the men to enlist. 

Enclosed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James 
Lovell. His case is truly pitiable. I wish some mode 
could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel shua- 
tion he is now in. I am sensible of the impropriety of 
exchanging a soldier for a citizen ; but there is some- 
thing so cruelly distressing in regard to this genUeman, 
that I dare say you will take it under your considera- 
tion, t I am, with great respect, &c.

* By the first resolve of Congress respecting these two battalions of 
marines, they were to be raised out of the army. Upon the representation 
of General Washington, tliat this would cause an interference with his ar- 
rangements, it was voted that the marines sliould be raised in addition to 
the proposed army. Congress liad also empowered the Commander-in- 
chief to call out the militia in the New England colonies whenever he 
should find it necessary, and requested those colonies severally to afford 
him all tlie assistance in their power to effect tliis object.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. , )^^ ^ 

Cambridge, 18 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favors, the first of the 28th uhimo, and the two 
last of the 9th instant, with their enclosures, I received. 
I am happy to hear of your being better, and heartily 
wish, that you may soon be perfectly recovered fi-om 
your indisposition. 

I should have been very glad, if Mr. Carleton had not 
made his escape. I trust ere long he will be in our 
hands, as I think we shall get possession of Quebec. * 

I am much concerned for Mr. Allen, and that he 
should be treated with such severity. I beg that you 
will have the matter and manner of his treatment strictly 
inquired into, and transmit me an account of the same, 
and whether General Prescott was active and instru- 
mental in occasioning it. From your letter, and Gen- 
eral Montgomery's to you, I am led to think he was. 
If so, he is deserving of our particular notice, and should 
experience some marks of our resentment for his cruelty 
to this gentleman, and his violation of the rights of hu- 
manity. As some of the prisoners have attempted to 
escape, I doubt not of yom- giving the necessary orders, 
that they may be prevented. It is a matter that should 
be attended to. In a letter from the Reverend Dr. 
Wheelock, of Dartmouth College, of the 2d instant, I 
had the following intelligence. 



/ 



* " The evening before General Montgomery landed on the island of 
Montreal, Mr. Carleton embarked his garrison on board of some vessels 
and small craft, and made two attempts to pass our batteries near the 
mouth of the Sorel, but was driven back by Colonel Easton, who has be- 
haved with bravery and much alertness. On the 19th, Mr. Carleton, dis- 
guised as a Canadian, and accompanied by six peasants, found means to 
make his escape. Brigadier-General Prescott surrendered ne.\t day by 
capitulation." — General Schuyler's Letter. 



208 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 43. 

"That the day before, two soldiers returning from 
Montreal informed him, that our officers were assured 
by a Frenchman (a captain of the artillery whom they 
had taken captive), that Major Rogers was second in 
command under General Carleton, and that he had 
been in an Indian habit through our encampment at St. 
John's." You will be pleased to have this report exam- 
ined into, and acquaint me as to the authenticity or 
probability of the truth of it. If any circumstances can 
be discovered to induce a behef, that he was there, he 
should be apprehended. He is now in this govern- 
ment. * 

The Congress have sent me several accounts against 
the rifle companies, one of which is against Captain 
Morgan, which I enclose to you, and desire it may be 



* Major Rogers had been celebrated for liis adventures and feats of 
valor in tlie Prencli war, as the companion of Putnam and Stark. He 
wrote a journal of those events, ivliich is not without ability and interest. 
He was once governor of Micliillimacliinac. After the peace he lived in 
New Hampshire, and continued an officer on half-pay. Dr. Wheelock's 
letter, from which the above is an extract, contains some other curious 
particulars about him; whether true or fabulous, the reader must judge. 

" On the 13th ultimo," says Dr. Wheelock, " the famous Major Rogers 
came to my house, from a tavern in the neighbourhood where lie called for

habit for one of his character. He treated me with great respect ; said he 
came from London in July, and had s])ent twenty days with the Congress 
in Philadelphia, and I forget how many at New York ; had been offered 
and urged to take a commission in favor of the colonies ; but, as he was 
now on half-pay from the crown, he thought proper not to accept it ; that 
he had fought two battles in Algiers under the Dey ; that he was now on 
a design to take care of some large grants of land made to him ; tliat he 
was going to visit his sister at Moor's Town, and tlien to return by Mem- 
mac River to visit his wife, whom he had not yet seen since his return 
from England ; that he had got a pass, or license to travel, from the Conti- 
nental Congress ; that he called to offer his services to procure a large 
interest for this college ; that the reputation of it was great in England ; 
that Lord Dartmouth and many other noblemen had spoken of it in his 
hearing, with expressions of the highest esteem and respect ; that Captain 
Holland, surveyor-general, now at New York, was a great friend to me

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. . 

Cambridge, 24 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 
Your favor of the 15th instant came yesterday to 
hand, with copies and extracts of your late letters to 
Congress. I have w'ith great attention perused them. 
I am very sorry to find by several paragraphs, that both 
you and General Montgomery incline to quit the ser- 
vice. Let me ask you. Sir, when is the time for brave 
men to exert themselves in the cause of liberty and 
their country, if this is not ? Should any difficulties, 



and tlie college, and would assist me in the affair ; and that now was the 
most favorable time to apply for a large grant of lands for it 

" I thanked him for these expressions of his kindness ; but, after I had 
shown some coldness in accepting it, he proposed to write to me on his 
journey, and let me know where I might reply to him ; and he should be 
ready to perform any friendly office in the affair. He said he was in haste 
to pursue his journey that evening." 

About a month after visiting Dr. Wheelock, the Major appeared at Med- 
ford, near the camp, and wrote to General Washington requesting him to 
sign a certificate permitting him to travel unmolested in the country. 
Such a certificate or permit had been first granted by the Committee of 
Safety in Philadelphia, who, from suspicious circumstances, and because 
he was actually a Britisli officer, had made him a prisoner, when he ar- 
rived in that place from England. The certificate was furnished to him in 
consequence of a parole, wherein he " solemnly pronused and engaged on 
the honor of a gentleman and soldier, that he would not bear arms against 
the American United Colonies in any manner whatsoever, during the 
American contest with Great Britain;" and in his letter to Washington, 
he says, "I love America ; it is my native country and that of my family, 
and I intend to spend the evening of my days in it." These professions 
being apparently sincere, Washington sent General Sullivan to e.xamine 
him on certain pomts, and report the result. He owned the accuracy of

that they may have to encounter at this important crisis, 
deter them ? God knows, there is not a difficulty, that 
you both very justly complain of, which I have not in an 
eminent degree experienced, that I am not every day 
experiencing ; but we must bear up against them, and 
make the best of mankind as they are, since w^e cannot 
have them as we wish. Let me, therefore, conjure you 
and Mr. Montgomery to lay aside such thoughts, — 
thoughts injurious to yourselves, and extremely so to 
your country, which calls aloud for gendemen of your 
abilities. 

You mention in your letter to Congress of the 20th 
ultimo, that the clothing was to remain at Albany, as 
General Montgomery would provide the troops in Can- 
ada. I wish they could be spared for this army, for 
we cannot get clothing for half of our troops. Let me 
hear from you on this subject as soon as possible. 

The proofs you have of the ministry's intention to en- 
gage the savages against us are incontrovertible. We 
have other confirmations of it, by several despatches 
from John Stuart, the superintendent for the southern 
®, 2-fJ>r '. 

Dr. Wheelock's letter, except tlie part relating to Canada, which he de- 
nied, though he had been to the west of Albany. As no good reason ap- 
peared why he came to camp, or why he wished to travel through the 
country, the General did not think it e.xpedient to receive a visit from him, 
nor to sign his permit ; but as this had already been signed by the Presi- 
dent of the New York Congress, and the Chairman of the New Hampshire 
Committee of Safety, he suffered the Major to depart at his option, and to 
enjoy such security as his papers, tlius authenticated, might procure him. 

There was a suspicion, strengthened by his subsequent conduct, that 
he was at this time a spy, or at least practising a very unwortliy artifice 
for acquiring a confidence, to which his political sentiments did not entitle 
him. Be this as it may, he soon after joined the enemy's ranks, and was 
raised to be a colonel in tlie British army, notwithstanding his parole of 
honor, and his love of America. It may be said, perhaps, in extenuation, 
that he considered his parole extorted irom him at a time, when there 
were no just grounds for questioning his motives, and by an authority, 
which he did not feel bound to respect.

district, which luckily fell into my hands, being found 
on board a sloop, sent by Lord Dunmore, bound to 
Boston. She was taken by one of our armed vessels. 
These, with many letters of consequence from his Lord- 
ship, I have lately sent to the Congress. 

I hope soon to hear, that Colonel Knox has made 
good progress in forwarding the artillery.* It is much 
wanted lor the works we have lately thrown up. I 
have written a letter, of the 18th instant, to General 
Howe respecting Mr. Allen, of which and the answer 
you have copies enclosed. I am, with great regard.

tion, that the genuine instrucdons given to Connolly ^ -j.-, \ .

* Colonel Knox had many obstacles to contend against in executing his 
charge, on account of the lateness of the season, and badness of the roads. 
By extraordinary energy and perseverance, however, which were marked 
traits of his character, he overcame them all, and effected his purpose. 
He wrote as follows to General Washington, from the head of Lake 
George, on the 17th of December. 

" I returned from Ticonderoga to this place on the 15th instant, and 
brought with me tlie cannon, it having taken nearly the time I conjectured 
it would to transport them hither. It is not easy to conceive the difficulties 
we have had in getting them over tlie Lake, owing to the advanced season 
of tlie year and contrary winds. Three days ago, it was very uncertain 
whether we could get them over until next spring, but now, please God, 
they shall go. I have made forty-two exceedingly strong sleds, and have 
provided eighty yoke of oxen to drag them as far as Springfield, where 1 
shall get fresh cattle to take them to camp."

fully concealed in the tree of his saddle, and covered 
with canvass so nicely, that they are scarcely discern- 
ible ; that those, which were found upon him, were in- 
tended to deceive, if he was caught. You will most 
certainly have his saddle taken to pieces, in order to 
discover this deep-laid plot.* 

Enclosed is a copy of General Howe's letter in an- 
swer to the one I wrote to him on the 18th instant. The 
conduct I am to observe towards Brigadier Prescott, in 
consequence of these letters, the Congress will oblige 
me by determining for me. The gentlemen by whom 
you sent the money are arrived. The sum they brought, 
though large, is not sufficient to answer the demands of 
the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy. 
There is three months' pay due, one month's advance, 
two dollars for each blanket, the arms, that are left by 
those who are dismissed, to be paid for, besides the 

* .Tohn Connolly was a pliysician, and had resided for several years at 
Pittsburg. General Washington had known him there, and a correspond- 
ence had been carried on between them respecting lands and affairs in the 
west. At the beginning of the war, Connolly took the side of Lord Dun- 
more, and a project was concerted between them to stir up tlie Indians on 
the frontiers of Virginia, and induce them to act against the colonies. For 
some purpose towards promoting the execution of the scheme, Connolly 
visited General Gage in Boston, and returned thence to Virginia, where 
he remained about ten days with Lord Dunmore, and tlien set off for the 
Oliio, with two companions. Near Ilagarstown, in Maryland, they were 
stopped on suspicion, and brought back to Frederic Town. Their papers 
were examined and the plot discovered. 

It appeared, that Connolly had been appointed to the command of a 
regiment, which was to be raised in the western country and Canada. 
He was now on his way to Detroit, and, as soon as tlie forces could be col- 
lected, he was to enter Virginia, march to Alexandria in the spring, and 
meet there Lord Dunmore at the head of a naval armament and another 
body of troops. With tliese combined forces they were to act as circum- 
stances should require. 

The committee at Frederic Town sent Connolly's papers to Congress, 
and he was himself immediately ordered to Philadelphia, where he was 
imprisoned for more than a year, and then was sent to a jaU in Baltimore. 
He was afterwards allowed to go abroad within certain limits, on his pa-

demands, on the commissary and quartermaster-gen- 
erals. You will, therefore, see the necessity of an- 
other remittance, which I beg may be as soon as you 
conveniently can. I will take the opportunity of the re- 
turn of these gentlemen, to send Colonel Kirkland to 
you for examination, and that you may dispose of him 
as to you may seem proper. 

A committee from the General Court of this province 
called on me the other day, informing me that they 
were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the 
colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in use 
here, was kept for the continent, they should be under 
the necessity of providing themselves with other; of 
course, what is kept must be paid for. There are many 
of the cannon of very little use ; such of them as are 
good, I cannot at present part with ; perhaps when I 
receive the supply from New York and Canada, it may 
be in my power to spare them. 

We have made good progress in the works on Lech- 
mere's Point. They would have been finished ere this, ; uc^..-m» ^^ 
but for the severity of the weather, which prevents our 
people from working. I received a letter from Gover- 
nor Cooke, which expresses the fears of the people of 
Rhode Island, lest the ships, which we had information 
had sailed with some troops on board, were destined 
for Newport. I sent Major-General Lee there, to point 
out to them such defence as he may think the place ca- 

role, but he was held a prisoner till near the close of the war. He wrote 
several times to General Washington, complaining of his hardships, but 
the General declined interfering, as he claimed no control over the pris- 
oners of Congress. Indeed, it may be added, that Washington seldom 
manifested any sympathy for characters of this description. Prisoners 
taken in lionorable warfare he always regarded witli feelings of delicacy 
and kindness ; but he rarely betrayed symptoms of compassion or favor for 
a man, who had indicated a disposition unfriendly to the cause of his 
country.

pable of. I sincerely wish he may be able to do it with 
effect, as that place, in its present state, is an asylum for 
such as are disaffected to American liberty. * Our re- 
turns of enlistments, to this day, amount to eight thoq-

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 25 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

At the same time that I thank you for stopping visi- 
tors in search of preferment, it will give me pleasure to 
show civilities to others of your recommendation. In- 
deed no gentleman, that is not well known, ought to 
come here without letters of introduction, as it puts me 
in an awkward situation with respect to my conduct to- 
wards them. 

I do not very much understand a paragraph in your 
letter, v/hich seems to be taken from mine to Colonel 
Hancock, expressive of the unwillingness of the Con- 
necticut troops to be deemed Continental. There is no 
expression in any of my letters, that I can either recol- 
lect or find, that has a tendency that way ; further than 
their unwillingness to have officers of other govern- 
ments mixed in their corps, in which they are not sin-

two small ones sailed out of the harbour on the 16th. Four days after- 
wards General Lee set off for Newport, attended by a guard and a party 
of riflemen. He went and returned through Providence, and was absent 
fi-om camp ten days. Besides giving directions respecting the fortifica- 
tions and other means of defence at Newport, he called before him several 
obnoxious persons, and tendered to tliem the oath of fidelity to tlie coun- 
try. Two custom-house officers and another person, refusing to take the 
oath, were put under guard and sent to Providence. </ <-t ^a.^<v«a<^,

gular, as the same partiality runs through the whole. I 
have in some measure anticipated the desires of the 
Connecticut delegates, by a kind of representation to 
each of the New England governments of the impracti- 
cability of raising our complement of men by voluntary 
enlistments, and submitting to their consideration, 
whether, if the powers of government are sufficiently 
coercive, each town should not be called upon for a 
proportionate number of recruits. What they will do 
in the matter remains to be known. The militia, who 
have supplied the places of the Connecticut regiments, 
behave much better than I expected they would under 
our want of wood, barracks, and blankets. With these 
men, and such as are reenhsted, I shall hope, if they 
will be vigilant and spirited, to give the enemy a warm 
reception, if they think proper to come out. Our want 
of powder is inconceivable. A daily waste and no sup- 
ply present a gloomy prospect. I fear the detention of 
the vessels from your port is so generally known, as to 
defeat the end. Two men-of-war, it is said, put in to 
New York the other day, and were immediately ordered 
out, supposed for Virginia. 

I am so much indebted for the civilities shown to Mrs. 
Washington on her journey hither, that I hardly know 
how to acknowledge them. Some of the enclosed (all 
of which I beg the favor of you to put into the post- 
office) are directed to that end, and I shall be obliged to 
you for presendng my thanks to the commanding offi- 
cers of the two battalions of Philadelphia for the honor 
done to her and me, as also to any others, equally en- 
tided. I very sincerely offer you the compliments of 
the season, and wish you and Mrs. Reed, and your fire- 
side, the happy return of many of them, being, dear Sir, 
yours, &c.

TO RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Cambndge, 26 December, 1775. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 6th instant did not reach this place 
till Saturday afternoon. The money, which accom- 
panied it, came seasonably, but not, as it was so long 
delayed, quantum siifficit, our demands at this time 
being peculiarly great for pay and advance to the 
troops ; pay for their arms and blanketing, independent 
of the demands of the commissary and quartermaster 
general. 

Lord Dunmore's letters to General Howe, which very 
fortunately fell into my hands, and were enclosed by me 
to Congress, will let you pretty fully into his diabolical 
schemes. If, my dear Sir, that man is not crushed be- 
fore spring, he will become the most formidable enemy 
America has ; his strength will increase as a snow ball, 
by rolling ; and faster, if some expedient cannot be hit 
upon to convince the slaves and servants of the impo- 
tency of his designs.* You will see by his letters, 
what pains he is taking to invite a reinforcement at all 
events there, and to transplant the war to the southern 
colonies. I do not think, that forcing his Lordship on 
shipboard is sufficient ; nothing less than depriving him 
of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia, as motives 
of resentment actuate his conduct, to a degree equal to 
the total destruction of the colony. I fear the destina- 
tion of the naval armament at Philadelphia is too well 
known to answer the design, f I have heard it spoken

of in common conversation, at this place, near a fort- 
night ago ; and the other day was told, that two men- 
of-war, going into the harbour of New York, supposed 
to be those intended for the relief of the Asia, were or- 
dered and accordingly sailed immediately out, as it is 
imagined for Virginia. 

My letters to Congress will give you the occurrences 
of this place. I need not repeat them, but I must beg 
of you, my good Sir, to use your influence in having a 
court of admiralty, or some power appointed to hear 
and determine all matters relative to captures ; you 
cannot conceive how I am plagued on this head, and 
how impossible it is for me to hear and determine upon 
matters of this sort, when the facts, perhaps, are only 
to be ascertained at ports, forty, fifty, or more miles 
distant, without bringing the parties here at great trouble 
and expense. At any rate, my time will not allow me 
to be a competent judge of this business. I must also 
beg the favor of you, to urge the necessity of appoint- 
ing a brigadier-general to the vacant brigade in this 
army. The inconvenience we daily experience for 
want of one is very great ; much more than the want 
of a colonel to a regiment, for then the next officer in 
command does the duty ; in a brigade this may not 
with propriety happen, and seldom or never is done 
with any kind of regularity. Perfectly indifferent is it 
to me, whom the Congress shall please to appoint to 
these offices ; I only want it done, that business may 
go regularly on. My best respects to the good family 
you are in, and to your brothers of the delegation ; and 
be assured, that I am, dear Sir, your most obedient and 
affectionate servant.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 



/ YWy^ e. . / O 4 ' Cambridge, 31 December, 1775. 

lyUru ^^u,<- I wrote you on the 25th instant, since which I am not 

honored with any of your favors. The estimate I then 
enclosed to you was calculated to pay the troops up to 
the 1st of January. That cannot be done for want of 
funds in the paymaster-general's hands, which causes a 
great murmuring amongst those who are going off. 
The monthly expenses of this army amount to near 
two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, which 
I take the liberty of recommending to the observation 
of Congress, that their future remittances may be 
governed thereby. 

Enclosed you have a copy of a representation sent to 
me by the legislative body of this province respecting 
four companies stationed at Braintree, Weymouth, and 
Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were 
doing duty at a distance from the rest of the army, I 
did not know whether to consider them as a part of it ; 
nor do I think myself authorized to direct payment for 
them without the approbation of Congress. 

It has been represented to me, that the free negroes, 
let. ^TTvt^-wA^i who have served in this army, are very much dissatis- 

iMf'^y fied at being discarded. As it is to be apprehended, 

that they may seek employ in the ministerial army, I 
have presumed to depart from the resolution respecting 
them, and have given license for their being enlisted. 
If this is disapproved of by Congress, I will put a stop 
to it.* 

L * At a meeting of the general officers, previously to the arrival of the 
committee from Congress in camp, it was unanimously resolved, that it 
was not expedient to enlist slaves in the new army, and by a large majority 
negroes of every description were excluded from enlistment. When the

I believe Colonel Gridley expects to be continued as 
chief engineer in this army. It is very certain we have 
no one here better qualified. I must remark, that the 
pay of the assistant engineers is so very small, that we 
cannot expect men of science will engage in it. Those 
gendemen, who are in that station, remained under the 
expectation, that an allowance would be made to them 
by the respective provinces in which they were ap- 
pointed, additional to that allowed by the Congress. 
Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. 
He left Quebec the 24th ultimo, in consequence of 
General Carleton's proclamation, which I have the hon- 
or to send you herewith. He saw Colonel Arnold the 
26th, and says that he was joined at Point aux Trem- 
bles by General Montgomery, the 1 st instant ; that they 
were about two thousand strong, and were making every 
preparation for attacking Quebec ; that General Carle- 
ton had with him about twelve hundred men, the ma- 
jority of whom are sailors ; that it was his opinion the 
French would give up the place, if they get the same con- 
ditions, that were granted to the inhabitants of Montreal. 

Captains Semple and Harbeson take under their care 
Mr. Kirkland. Captain Matthews and Mr. Robinson will 
accompany them. The two latter were taken prisoners 
by Lord Dunmore, who was sending them to Boston, 
from whence there is Utde doubt, but they would 
be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly 
informed Captain Martindale and the crew of the Wash- ' ' i 
ingtofi are sent; also Colonel Allen, and the prison- 
ers taken with him in Canada. This may account for

ington. Many black soldiers were in the service, during all stages of 
the war. "]

General Howe's silence on the subject of an exchange 
of prisoners mentioned in my letter to him. 

General Lee is just returned from his excursion to 
Rhode Island. He has pointed out the best method 
the island would admit of for its defence. He has en- 
deavoured all in his power to make friends of those 
that were our enemies. You have, enclosed, a specimen 
of his abilities in that way, for your perusal. I am of 
opinion that, if the same plan was pursued through 
every province it would have a very good effect. 

I have long had it on my mind to mention to Con- 
gress, that frequent applications had been made to me 
respecting the chaplains' pay, which is too small to en- 
courage men of abilities. Some of them, who have left 
their flocks, are obliged to pay the parson acting for 
them more than they receive. I need not point out the 
great utility of gentlemen, whose lives and conversation 
are unexceptionable, being employed for that service in 
this army. There are two ways of making it worth the at- 
tention of such ; one is an advancement of their pay ; the 
other, that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. 
This last, I think, may be done without inconvenience. 
I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congress, 
whose sentiments hereon I shall impatiently expect. 

Upon a farther conversation with Captain Freeman, 
he is of opinion, that General Montgomery has with him 
near three thousand men including Colonel Arnold's. 
He says that Lord Pitt had received repeated orders 
from his father to return home ; in consequence of 
which, he had embarked some time in October, with a 
Captain Greene, who was master of a vessel belong- 
ing to Philadelphia. By a number of salutes in Boston 
harbour yesterday, I fancy Admiral Shuldham is arrived. 
P ' Two large ships were seen coming in. Our enlistments 

now amount to nine thousand six hundred and fifty.

Since my last of the 31st ultimo, I have been honored

way as a council of officers shall think most likely to

you may expect, or my wishes prompt, I request that

do me the justice to believe, that circumstances, and 
not want of inclination, are the cause of delay. *

Washington and liis council of war should be of opinion, that a successful 

attack may be made on the troops in Boston, he do it in any manner he 

may think expedient, notwithstanding the town and property in it may 

be destroyed." In communicating this resolve, President Hancock wrote ; 

— " You will notice the resolution relative to an attack upon Boston. This 

passed after a most serious debate in a committee of the whole house, 

and the execution was referred to you. May God crown your attempt 

with success. I most heartily wish it, though individually I may be the 

greatest sufferer." President Hancock possessed a valuable property in 

Boston.

case like ours. To maintain a post within musket-shot 
of the enemy, for six months together, without* , 

and at the same time to disband one army, and recruit 
another, within that distance of twenty-odd British regi- 
ments, is more, probably, than ever was attempted. 
But if we succeed as well in the last, as we have here- 
tofore in the first, I shall think it the most fortunate 
event of my whole life. 

By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchinson 
^'t-*^'^ *^*^'*^'- from Boston, I learn, that it was Admiral Shuldham that 
i.«^.-ws , ^^ came into the harbour on Saturday last ; that two of 

*^^ »*^'v-v^ Ds ^ ^]^g gyg regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax ; 
two others have sailed for Quebec, but what was be- 
com.e of them could not be told ; and the other, the 
fifty-fifth, has just got into Boston. Certain it is, also, 
that the greater part of the seventeenth regiment is 
arrived there. Whether we are to conclude from 
hence, that more than five regiments have been sent 
out, or that the companies of the seventeenth, arrived 
at Boston, are part of the regiments destined for Halifax 
and Quebec, I know not. 

We also learn from this gentleman and others, that 
the troops, embarked for Halifax, as mentioned in my 
letter of the 1 6th, were really designed for that place, 
but recalled from Nantasket Road, upon advice being 
received of the above regiments there. I am also in- 
formed of a fleet now getting ready, under the convoy 
of the Scarborough and Fowey men-of-war, consisting 
of five transports and two bomb-vessels, with about 
three hundred marines, and several flat-bottomed boats. 
It is whispered, that they are designed for Newport, but 
generally thought in Boston that they are meant for

by more troops, as the other ti-ansports are taking in 
water, to lie, as others say, in Nantasket Road, to be 
out of the ice. A large quantity of biscuit is also 
baking. 

As the real design cannot with certainty be known, I 
submit it with all due deference to the superior judg- 
ment of Congress, whether it would not be consistent 
witl: prudence to have some of the Jersey troops thrown 
into New York, to prevent an evil, which would be 
almost irremediable, should it happen, I mean the land- 
ing of troops at that place, or upon Long Island near it.* 
As it is possible you may not yet have received his 
Majesty's ''most gracious" speech, I do myself the 
honor to enclose one of many, which were sent out of 
Boston yesterday. It is full of rancor and resentment 
against us, and explicitly holds forth his royal will to be, 
that vigorous measures must be pursued, to deprive us 
of our constitutional rights and liberties. These meas- 

* The British commander had no design of taking immediate possession 
of Rhode Island or New York, as we have seen by former references to 
his correspondence, although both these purposes were in prospect. The 
forces, tliat sailed from Boston, in the month of January, under command 
of General Clinton, were bound to North Carolina, with the intention to 
join Lord Cornwallis in a grand enterprise against tliat colony, which tlie 
ministry had planned several months before, in consequence of the reports 
and solicitation of Governor Martin. It was supposed, that there would 
be a general rising among the loyalists in that country, when supported 
by a formidable force, and supplied with arms, and thus a secure hold 
would be gained on all the southern provinces. The affair turned out to 
be a signal failure, as did most of those undertaken at the suggestion of 
the colonial governors and zealous partisans of the crown, whose wishes 
and hopes betrayed them into a deplorable ignorance of the state of the 
country and character of the people. 

On tiie 13th of December, Governor Tryon wrote a letter to General ' 
Howe, dated on board his Majesty's ship Duchess of Gordon, in the harbour 
of New York, informing him, that tlie spirit of rebellion was decreasing in 
that colony, and that five thousand regular troops only were wanting to re- 
store commerce and the old government; that many counties were well

ures, whatever they be, I hope will be opposed bj^ 
more vigorous ones, and rendered unavailing and fruit- 
less, though sanctioned and authorized by the name of 
majesty, a name which ought to promote the happi- 
ness of his people, and not their oppression.

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 4 January, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 
We are at length favored with a sight of his Majesty's 
most gracious speech, breathing sentiments of tender- 
ness and compassion for his deluded American sub- 
jects ; the echo is not yet come to hand ; but we know 
what it must be, and as Lord North said, and we ought 
to have believed and acted accordingly, we now know 
the ultimatum of British justice. The speech I send 

affected, and in others were friends, who called for protection from the in- 
sults of the insurgents. If General Clinton, or some other officer, would 
come with a suitable force. Governor Tryon was ready to take the field 
under him, and believed he could collect a body of two or three thousand 
loyalists, provided he were authorized to put them on tlie establishment of 
regulars. At all events, he requested three thousand firearms, and one 
hundred thousand cartridges ; but, in his present condition, he saw no 
prospect of getting ashore to resume his government. 

General Howe replied, that it was impossible to send the force re- 
quired at that time, as the anny in Boston could not be divided, but he 
might expect the earliest assistance in the spring. Meantime ho advised, 
that the willingness of the friends of the crown to take up arms should 
not be known, but rather that the insurgents should receive the impression 
of their neutrality, or even of their being dissatisfied with the govern- 
ment, since no troops had been sent to their support. In tliis idea he declin- 
ed forwarding the arms and ammunition, because such a step, before they 
could be used, would only serve to alarm the insurgents. If it could be 
supposed possible to gain and keep possession of New York, witli the 
force desired, it should be despatched without delay ; but of such a result 
there could be no just hope. — MS. Letters.

you. A volume of them was sent out by the Boston 
gentry, and, farcical enough, we gave great joy to them, 

without knowing or intending it ; for on that day, the 

day which gave being to the new army, but before the ^ ^ j^rii*^ 
proclamation came to hand, we had hoisted the union n> .^.^^ / /,S"-a_ 

flag in compliment to the United Colonies. But, behold, ___-_i- 

it was received in Boston as a token of the deep im- ' / . ., ^V" ^U vU 
pression the speech had made upon us, and as a signal ,-^ ^.^ /fil4 , 
of submission. So we hear by a person out of Boston 
last night. By this time I presume they begin to think 
it strange, that w'e have not made a formal surrender of 
our lines. 

Admiral Shuldham is arrived at Boston. The fifty- 
fifth and the greater part, if not all, of the seventeenth 
regiment, are also arrived. The rest of the five regiments 
from Ireland were intended for Hahfax and Quebec. 

It is easier to conceive than to describe the situation 
of my mind for some time past, and my feeUngs under 
our present circumstances. Search the volumes of his- 
tory through, and I much question whether a case simi- 
lar to ours is to be found ; namely, to maintain a post 
against the flower of the British troops for six months 
together, without powder, and then to have one army 
disbanded and another to be raised within the same 
distance of a reinforced enemy. It is too much to at- 
tempt. What may be the final issue of the last ma- 
noeuvre, time only can unfold. I wish this month was 
well over our heads. The same desire of retiring into 
a chimney-corner seized the troops of New Hampshire, 
Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, so soon as their time 
expired, as had wrought upon those of Connecti- 
cut, notwithstanding many of them made a tender of 
. their services to continue, till the lines could be sufficient- 
ly strengthened. We are now left with a good deal 
less than half raised regiments, and about five thousand

militia, who only stand engaged to the middle of this 
month; when, according to custom, they will depart, 
let the necessity of their stay be ever so urgent. Thus, 
for more than two months past, I have scarcely emerged 
from one difficulty before I have been plunged into 
another. How it will end, God in his great goodness 
will direct. I am thankful for his protection to this 
time. We are told that we shall soon get the army 
completed, but I have been told so many things, which 
have never come to pass, that I distrust every thing. 

I fear your fleet has been so long in fitting, and the 
destination of it so well known, that the end will be de- 
feated, if the vessels escape.* How is the arrival of 
French troops in the West Indies, and the hostile ap- 
pearance there, to be reconciled with that part of the 
King's speech, wherein he assures Parliament, " that as 
well from the assurances I have received, as from the 
general appearance of affairs in Europe, I see no proba- 
bility that the measures, which you may adopt, will be 
interrupted by disputes with any foreign power?" I 
hope the Congress will not think of adjourning at so 
important and critical a juncture as this. I wish they 
would keep a watchful eye to New York ; from the ac- 
count of Captain Sears, now here, much is to be appre- 
hended from that quarter. I am, with sincere and af- 
fectionate regard, &c. 

* At this time Governor Tryon, who was on ship-board in the harbour 
of New York, had spies in Philadelphia, wlio informed him of every occur- 
rence. They even obtained extracts from the journals of Congress, wrote 
down the resolves, the appointment and doings of committees, tlie opin- 
ions of many of the delegates, their conversations, projects, and aims, all 
of wliich were forwarded through Governor Tryon and General Howe to 
the British ministry. In this way General Howe was made acquainted 
with the details of the fitting out of the fleet at Philadelphia, about to sail 
under Commodore Hopkins. Each vessel was minutely described, with 
the number of guns, weight of metal, number of men, names of the offi- 
cers, and other particulars.

* 

Cambridge, G January, 1776. 

Sir, 

I received your favor of the 1 st instant, and return 
you my thanks for the blankets and your promise of 
having more procured, as they are wanted. I did not 
see Mr. Hale, who brought them, nor the account, or '"*■•"? '''••: "* 
the money should have been transmitted to you by his 
return. You will be pleased to draw on the quarter- 
master-general, and it shall be immediately paid. I 
have seen General Lee since his expedition, and hope 
Rhode Island will derive some advantage from it. 
J I am told that Captain , Wallace's ships have been (7. » -*. 1^ 

supplied for some time by the town of Newport, on^**'' v'^S^.-C'''^'*^ , 
certain conditions stipulated between him and the com- ^M . 35/, ^%«^, t^7 
mittee. When this truce first obtained, perhaps it xj:/^© 
was right. Then there might have been hopes of an 
accommodation taking place; but now, when every 
prospect of it seems to be cut off by his Majesty's late 
speech ; when the throne, from which we had suppli- 
cated redress, breathes forth vengeance and indignation, 
and a firm determination to remain unalterable in its 
purposes, and to prosecute the system and plan of ruin 
formed by the ministry against us, should not an end be 
put to it, and every possible method be fallen upon to 
prevent their getting necessaries of any kind ? We 
need not expect to conquer our enemies by good ofl*!- 
ces ; and I know not what pernicious consequences 
may result from a precedent of this sort. Other places, 
circumstanced as Newport is, may follow the example, 
and by that means their whole fleet and army w-ill be 
furnished with what it highly concerns us to keep from 
them. 

I received a letter from Grovernor Trumbull of the 



228 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

1st instant, by which I am informed, that the Connecti- 
cut Assembly are very unanimous in the common cause ; 
and, among other acts have passed one for raising and 
equipping a fourth of their militia, to be immediately 
selected by voluntary enlistments ; with such other able, 
effective men, as are not included in their militia rolls, 
who incline to enhst, to act as minute-men for the de- 
fence of their own, or any of the United Colonies, and 
this under proper encouragements; — another act for 
restraining and punishing persons inimical to us, and 
directing proceedings therein; — no person to supply the 
ministerial army or navy, to give them intelligence, to 
enlist, or procure others to enlist, in their service, to 
pilot their vessels, or in any other way assist them, 
under pain of forfeiting his estate, and of an imprison- 
ment not exceeding three years; — none to write, speak, 
or act against the proceedings of Congress, or their 
acts of Assembly, under penalty of being disarmed, 
and disqualified from holding any office, and be further 
punished by imprisonment; — another act for seizing 
and confiscadng, for the use of the colony, the estates 
of those putting or continuing to shelter themselves 
under the protection of the ministerial fleet or army, or 
assisting them in carrying on their measures against us ; 
— a resolve to provide two armed vessels, of sixteen and 
fourteen guns, with a spy-schooner of four, and four 
row-galleys; — an act exempting the polls of soldiers 
from taxes, for the last and ensuing campaigns ; — anoth- 
er for encouraging the making of saltpetre and gun- 
powder, a considerable quantity of both of which 
Mr. Trumbull hopes to make early in the spring. He 
says the furnace at Middletown is smeUing lead, and 
hkely to turn out twenty or thirty tons, and that ore is 
plenty. They have also passed an act empowering the 
Commander-in-chief of the Continental army, or officers 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 229 

commanding a detachment, or outposts, to administer 
an oath and swear any person or persons to the truth 
of matters relative to the public service. The situation 
of our affairs seems to call for regulations like these, 
and I should think the other colonies ought to adopt 
similai- ones, or such of them as they have not already 
made. Vigorous ones, and such as at another time 
would appear extraordinary, are now become absolutely 
necessary, for preserving our country against the strides 
of tyranny making against it. 

Governor Trumbull, in his list, has not mentioned an 
act for impressing carriages, agreeably to the recommen- 
dation of Congress. This, I hope, they have not for- 
gotten. It is highly necessary, that such an authority 
should be given, under proper restrictions, or we shall 
be greatly embarrassed, whenever the army, or any de- 
tachment from it, may find it necessary to march from 
hence. I am, Sir, with very great esteem, &,c.

General Lee's departure for New York is advisable 
upon the plan of his letter, and, under the circumstances

taking a comprehensive view of it ; that is, you will not 
only consider the propriety of the measure, but of the 
execudon; and whether such a step, though right in 
itself, may not be looked upon as beyond ray line.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL CHARLES LEE.f 

Instructions. 

/ •/ Having undoubted intelligence oi the fitting out of a 

fleet at Boston, and of the embarkation of troops from 

* General Lee was just returned to camp from Newport, and had writ- 
ten to the Commander-in-chief; — "New Yorlv must be secured, but it will 
never, I am afraid, be secured by due order of the Congress, for obvious 
reasons. They find themselves awkwardly situated on this head. You 
■2- 3 dt^t must step in to their relief I am sensible, tliat no men can be spared 

from the lines, under present circumstances ; but I would propose that 
you should detach me into Connecticut, and lend your name for collecting 
a body of volunteers. I am assured that I shall find no difficulty in as- 
sembling a sufficient number for the purposes wanted. This body, in 
conjunction (if there should appear occasion to summon them) with the 
Jersey regiment, under the command of Lord Stirling now at Elizabeth- 
town, will effect the security of New York, and the expulsion or suppres- 
sion of that dangerous banditti of tories, who have appeared on Long 
Island with the professed intention of acting against the authority of the 
Congress. Not to crush these serpents, before their rattles are grown, 
would be ruinous. 

" This manoeuvre I not only think prudent and right, but absolutely 
necessary to our salvation ; and if it meets, as I ardently hope it will, 
with your approbation, the sooner it is entered upon the better ; indeed, 
the delay of a single day may be fatal." 

Mr. Adams replied in writing to General Washington's letter, highly 
approving the plan, and spoke on one point of inquiry as follows. — 
« That it is within the limits of your Excellency's command, is, in my 
mind, perfectly clear. Your commission constitutes you Commander of all 
the forces now raised or to be raised, and of all others who shall volun- 
tarily offer their service, and join the army for the defence of American 
liberty, and for repelling every hostile invasion thereof; and you are vested 
with full power and authority to act as you shall think for the good and 
welfare of the service." 

t At the same time, that these instructions were given, General Wash- 
ington wrote to the Committee of Safety of New York ; — " I have thought

thence, which, from the season of the year and other 
circumstances, must be destined for a southern expedi- 
tion ; and having such information as I can rely on, that 
the inhabitants, or a great part of them, on Long Island 
in the colony of New York, are not only inimical to the 
rights and liberties of America, but, by their conduct 
and public professions, have discovered a disposition to 
aid and assist in the reduction of that colony to ministe- 
rial tyranny ; and as it is a matter of the utmost impor- 
tance to prevent the enemy from taking possession of 
the city of New York and the North River, as they will 
thereby command the country, and the communication 
with Canada; it is of too much consequence to hazard 
such a post at so alarming a crisis, since we find by 
his Majesty's speech to Parliament, that, disregarding 
the petition of the united voice of America, nothing 
less than the total subversion of her rights will satisfy 
him. 

You will, therefore, with such volunteers as are willing 
to join you, and can be expeditiously raised, repair to 
the city of New York ; and calling upon the command- 
ing officer of the forces of New Jersey for such assist- 
ance as he can afford, and you shall require, you are to 
put that city into the best posture of defence, which 
the season and circumstances will admit, disarming all 



it expedient to despatch Major-General Lee, with such volunteers as he 
can quickly assemble on his march (for I have not troops to spare from 
hence, if the distance and time would admit of it), to put tlie city of New- 
York in the best posture of defence, which tlie season and circumstances 
will admit of To his instructions, which I have desired him to lay be- 
fore you, I beg leave to refer ; firmly persuaded, that your honorable body 
will give every assistance in their power to facilitate the end of his 
coming, as there needs no other argument, than a . retrospective view of 
the conduct of the ministerial troops in Boston, and the consequences 
residting from it, to prove what a fatal stab it would give to the interests 
of America, to suffer the city of New York to fall into the hands of our 
enemies."

such persons upon Long Island and elsewhere, (and if 
necessary otherwise securing them,) whose conduct and 
declarations have rendered them justly supected of de- 
signs unfriendly to the views of Congress. 

You are, also, to inquire into the state and condition 
of the fortifications up the North River, and as far as 
shall be consistent with the orders of Congress, or not 
repugnant to them, to have the works guarded against 
surprises from a body of men, which might be transport- 
ed by water near the place, and then marched in upon 
the back of them. 

You will also endeavour to have the medicines, shirts, 
and blankets, now at New York, belonging to the 
ministerial troops, secured, and forwarded to this army. 
Captain Sears can give you particular information con- 
cerning them.* 

In all other matters relative to the execution of the 
general plan you are going upon, your own judgment 
(as it is impossible with propriety to give pr\rticular di- 
rections), and the advice of those whom yoi; have rea- 
son to believe are hearty in the cause, must direct you ; 
keeping always in view the declared intentions of Con- 
gress. 

I am persuaded I need not recommend despatch in 
the prosecution of this business. The importance of it 
alone is a sufficient incitement. I would advise a dis- 
mission of the volunteers, whose necessary expenses 
will be borne, so soon as the service will admit of it ; 
and that you endeavour as much as possible at all times 

* Captain Sears had been most zealous and efficient among the soiui of 
liberty in New York, and had acted a conspicuous part in that city during 
the excitements occasioned by the Boston Port-Bill, and afterwards. He 
had also been a member of the New York Provincial Congress. At this 
time he was in Washington's camp, and was sent forward in advance of 
General Lee to promote the raising of volunteers in Connecticut. — See

our affairs here should call for it. Given under my

January, 1776. 



TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS BAA^ 

Cambridge, 10 January, 1776. 

Gentlemen, 

The hurry I was in the other day, when your com- 
mittee did me the honor to present a pedtion from a 
person, whose name I have forgotten, wanting to be em- 
ployed in the Continental army, prevented me from 
being as full on the subject as I wished. 

I shall beg leave, therefore, at this time to add, that I 
hope your honorable Board will do me the jusdce to 
believe, that it will give me pleasure at all dmes to pay 
a proper respect to any recommendation coming from 
them, and that the reason why I do not now encourage 
such kind of applications, as was then made, is, that the 
new army was arranged, as near the plan and agreeably 
to the orders of Congress, although some unavoidable 
changes and departures have taken place, as it was in 
my power to effect; and the officers thus constitu- 
ted were ordered to recruit. Every attempt, therefore, 
of others not of this appointment must counteract it, and 
has been of infinite prejudice to the service. They in- 
fuse ideas into the minds of the men they have any 
influence over, that, by engaging with them, or, which 
is tantamount, not engaging with others, they shall be 
able to force themselves into the service. Of this we 
have numberless instances. 

I am, therefore, anxious to discourage every attempt 
of the kind, by convincing such persons, that their en-

gaging a company will not bring them in. If such per- 
sons could be once convinced of this, the business of 
the army would go on more smoothly, and with much 
more regularity and order. In short, gentlemen, it is 
scarce possible for me to convey to you a perfect idea 
of the trouble and vexation I have met with, in getting 
this matter fixed upon some settled footing. One day 
an officer would serve ; another, he would not, and so 
on, till I have hardly known what steps to pursue for 
preserving consistency, and advancing the good of the 
service, which are the only objects I have in view. I 
have no friend whom I w ant to bring in, nor any person 
with whom I am in the least connected, that I wish to 
promote. I am, gentlemen, with much esteem, &c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Cambridge, 11 January, 1776. 



Every account I have out of Boston confirms the 
embarkation of troops mentioned in my last, which, 
from the season of the year and other circumstances, 
must be destined for some expedition to the south- 
ward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to 
send Major-General Lee to New York. I have given 
him letters recommendatory to Governor Trumbull, and 
to the Committee of Safety at New York. I have good 
hopes that in Connecticut he will get many volunteers, 
who, I have some reason to think, wOl accompany him 
on this expedition, without more expense to the conti- 
nent than their maintenance. But should it be other- 
wise, and should they expect pay, I think it is a trifling 
consideration, when put in competition with the impor- 
tance of the object, which is to put the city of New

York, with such parts of the North River and Long 
Island, as to him shall seem proper, in that state of 
defence, which the season of the year and circumstan- 
ces will admit of, so as, if possible, to prevent the ene- 
my from forming a lodgment in that government, which, 
I am afraid, contains too many persons disaffected to 
the cause of liberty and America. I have also written 
to Lord Stirling to give him all the assistance that he 
can, with the troops under his command in the Conti- 
nental service, provided it does not interfere with any 
orders he may receive from Congress relative to them.* 
I hope the Congress will approve of my conduct in 
sending General Lee upon this expedition. I am sure 
I mean it well, as experience teaches us, that it is much 
easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves, 
than it is to dislodge them after they have got posses- 
sion. I am, with great respect, &,c.

Sir, 
Your favor of the 5th ultimo from before Quebec,

* William Alexander, known by the tide of the Earl of Stirling, was 
born in New York. He served in a military capacity, during the former 
war, under General Shirley, and passed several years in England. While 
there, he made a claim to the Scottish earldom of Stirling, which he was 
believed to have legally established, but the decision of the House of 
Lords was unfavorable. By courtesy, however, the title was always after- 
wards granted to him. On his return to America, he took up his resi- 
dence in New Jersey. He was by Congress appointed colonel of the 
first battalion of New Jersey troops, on the 7th of November, 1775, and 
in March following was raised to the rank of brigadier-general. A brief 
and well ^vritten sketch of the life of Lord Stirling may be found in 
Sedgwick's Memoir of the Life of JVUliam Livingston, p. 213.

hand. From the account you give of the garrison, and 
the state of the walls, I expect soon to hear from you 
within them, which will give me vast pleasure. 

I am informed that there are large quantities of arms, 
blankets, clothing, and other military stores in that city. 
These are articles, which we are in great want of here ; 
I have, therefore, written to General Montgomery, 
or whoever is commanding officer in that quarter, to 
send me as many as can be spared from thence. If 
you can assist in expediting them, you will much 
oblige me. 

I understand that the Congress have it under their 
consideration to raise an army for the defence of Cana- 
da, on a new establishment. When I received this 
informadon, I applied to Congress to know whether it 
was their intention, that you and the officers in your de- 
tachment were to be appointed there, or remain as you 
were appointed in this army as newly arranged ; to 
which I have not yet received their answer. 

The want of so many good officers is felt here, 
especially in the recruiting service, which does not go 
on so briskly as I could wish. I think it will be best 
for you to settle for the arrearages, due to your men 
since October last, with the paymaster of the army at 
your place. I do not know any better way for you or 
them to receive it, I am, Sir, yours, &c.* 

* The following order, issued by General Howe, presents a somewhat 
curious picture of the habits and appearance of the soldiers under his 
command in Boston. 

" The commanding officer is surprised to find the necessity of repeat- 
ing orders, that long since ought to have been complied with, as the men 
on all duties appear in the following manner, viz. hair not smooth and 
badly powdered, several without slings to their firelocks, hats not bound, 
pouches in a shameful and dirty condition, no frills to their shirts, and 
their linen very dirty, leggings hanging in a sloveidy manner about their 
knees, some men without uniform stocks, and their arms and accoutre- 
ments by no means so clean as they ought to be. These unsoldierlike

Dear Sir, 

The bearer presents an opportunity to me of ac- - tnx-/<i(J-v^^f 

knowledging the receipt of your favor of the 30th ulti- "^ 6 
mo, which never came to my hands till last night, and, 
if I have not done it before, of your other letter of 
the 23d preceding. 

The hints you have communicated from time to time 
not only deserve, but do most sincerely and cordially 
meet with my thanks. You cannot render a more ac- 
ceptable service, nor in my estimation give me a more 
convincing proof of your friendship, than by a free, 
open, and undisguised account of every matter relative 
to myself or conduct. I can bear to hear of imputed 
or real errors. The man, who wishes to stand well in 
the opinion of others, must do this ; because he is 
thereby enabled to correct his faults, or remove the 
prejudices which are imbibed against him. For this 
reason, I shall thank you for giving me the opinions of 
the world, upon such points as you know me to be in- 
terested in ; for, as I have but one capital object in view, 
I could wish to make my conduct coincide with the 
wishes of mankind, as far as I can consistently ; I mean, 
without departing from that great line of duty, which, 
though hid under a cloud for some time, from a pe- 



neglects must be immediately remedied."— Gtntral Howe's Orderly Book, 
January I3th. 

In this state of discipline it required some assurance in General Howe 
to write to Lord Dartmouth, as lie did a short time before ; — " We are 
not under the least apprehension of an attack upon this place from the 
rebels by surprise or otherwise, as taken notice of in your Lordship's 
letter; on the contrary, it were to be wished, that they would attempt 
so rash a step, and quit those strong intrenchments to which they may 
attribute their present safety." 



238 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t 43. 

culiarity of circumstances, may nevertheless bear a 
scrutiny. 

My constant attention to the great and perplexing 
objects, which continually rise to my view, absorbs all 
lesser considerations, and indeed scarcely allows me to 
reflect, that there is such a body in existence as the 
General Court of this colony, but when I am reminded 
of it by a committee ; nor can I, upon recollection, 
discover in what instances (I wish they would be more 
explicit) I have been inattentive to, or slighted them. 
They could not, surely, conceive that there was a pro- 
priety in unbosoming the secrets of an army to them ; 
that it was necessary to ask their opinion of throwing 
up an intrenchment, or forming a battalion. It must, 
therefore, be what I before hinted to you ; and how 
to remedy it I hardly know, as I am acquainted with 
few of the members, never go out of my own lines, nor 
see any of them in them. 

I am exceedingly sorry to hear, that your little fleet 
has been shut in by the frost. I hope it has sailed ere 
this, and given you some proof of the utility of it, and 
enabled the Congress to bestow a little more attention 
to the affairs of this army, which suffers exceedingly by 
their overmuch business, or too little attention to it. 
We are now without any money in our treasury, powder 
in our magazines, or arms in our stores. We are with- 
out a brigadier (the want of whom has been twenty 
times urged), engineers, expresses (though a committee 
has been appointed these two months to establish them), 
and by and by, when we shall be called upon to take 
the field, shall not have a tent to lie in. Apropos, what 
is doing with mine ? 

These are evils, but small in comparison of those, 
which disturb my present repose. Our enUstments are 
at a stand ; the fears I ever entertained are realized ; 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 239 

that is, the discontented officers (for I do not know how ^y^ q /a"»- 
else to account lor it) have thrown such diUicultie.s or ' / 

stumbhng-blocks in the way of" recruiting, that I no 
longer entertain a hope of completing the army by 
voluntary enlistments, and I see no move or hkelihood 
to do it by other means. In the two last weeks we have 
enlisted but about a thousand men ; whereas I was con- 
fidently led to believe, by all the officers I conversed 
with, that we should by this time have had the regi- 
ments nearly completed. Our total number upon paper 
amounts to about ten thousand five hundred ; but as a 
large portion of these are returned not joined, I never 
expect to receive them, as an ineffectual order has once 
issued to call them in. Another is now gone forth, 
peremptorily requiring all officers under pain of being 
cashiered, and recruits of being treated as deserters, to 
join their respective regiments by the 1st day of next 
month, that I may know my real strength ; but if my 
fears are not imaginary, I shall have a dreadful account 
of the advanced month's pay. In consequence of the 
assurances given, and my expectation of having at least 
men enough enlisted to defend our lines, to which may 
be added my unwillingness to burthen the cause with 
unnecessary expense, no relief of militia has been 
ordered in, to supply the places of those, who are re- 
leased from their engagements to-morrow, and as to 
whom, though many have promised to continue out the 
month, there is no security for their stay. 

Thus am I situated with respect to men. With re- 
gard to arms I am yet Avorse off. Before the dissolution 
of the old army, I issued an order directing three ju- 
dicious men of each brigade to attend, review, and ap- 
praise the good arms of every regiment ; and finding a 
very great unwillingness in the men to part with their 
arms, at the same time not having it in my power to pay 



240 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 43. 

them for the months of November and December, I 
threatened severely, that every soldier, who should 
carry away his firelock without leave, should never re- 
ceive pay for those months ; yet so many have been 
carried off, partly by stealth, but chiefly as condemned, 
that we have not at this time one hundred guns in the 
stores, of all that have been taken in the prize-ship 
and from the soldiery, notwithstanding our regiments 
are not half complete. At the same time I am told, 
and beheve it, that to restrain the enlistment to men 
with arms, you will get but few of the former, and still 
fewer of the latter, which would be good for any thing. 

How to get furnished I know not. I have apphed to 
this and the neighbouring colonies, but with what suc- 
cess time only can tell. The reflection on my situation, 
and that of this army, produces many an unhappy hour 
when all around me are wi'apped in sleep. Few people 
know the predicament we are in, on a thousand ac- 
counts ; fewer still will believe, if any disaster happens 
to these lines, from what cause it flows. I have often 
thought how much happier I should have been, if, in- 
stead of accepting the command under such circumstan- 
ces, I had taken my musket on my shoulder and en- 
tered the ranks, or, if I could have justified the measure 
to posterity and my own conscience, had retired to the 
back country, and lived in a wigwam. If I shall be able 
to rise superior to these and many other difliculties, 
which might be enumerated, I shall most religiously be- 
heve, that the finger of Providence is in it, to blind the 
eyes of our enemies ; for surely if we get well through 
this month, it must be for want of their knowing the 
disadvantages we labor under. 

Could I have foreseen the difficulties, which have come 
upon us ; could I have known, that such a backward- 
ness would have been discovered among the old sol-

diers * to the service, all the generals upon earth should 
not have convinced me of the propriety of delaying an 
attack upon Boston till this time. When it can now be 
attempted, I will not undertake to say ; but thus much I 
will answer for, that no opportunity can present itself 
eariier than my wishes. But as this letter discloses 
some interesting truths, I shall be somewhat uneasy 
until I hear it gets to your hands, although the convey- 
ance is thought safe. 

We made a successful attempt a few nights ago upon (fi,. ^^ i-x*^^

were daily pulling down for fuel. Five soldiers, and 

the wife of one of them, inhabiting one of the houses, 

were brought off prisoners ; another soldier was killed ; 

none of ours hurt. 

Having undoubted information of the embarkation of 
troops, somewhere from three to five hundred, at Bos- 
ton, and being convinced they are designed either for 
the New York government (from whence we have 
some very disagreeable accounts of the conduct of the 
Tories) or Virginia, I despatched General Lee a few jjcx. <n-v /^ f6 '

By a ship just arrived at Portsmouth, New Hamp- 
shire, we have London prints to the 2d of November, 
containing the addresses of Parliament, which are 
httle more than a repetition of the speech, with assur- 
ances of standing by his Majesty with hves and fortunes. 
The captains (for there were three or four of them pas- 
sengers) say, that we have nothing to expect but the 
most vigorous exertions of administration, who have a 
dead majority upon all questions, although the Duke of 
Grafton and General Conway have joined the minority, 
as also the Bishop of Peterborough. These captains 
affirm confidently, that the five regiments from Ireland 
cannot any of them have arrived at Halifax, inasmuch 
as, by a violent storm on the 19 th of October, the 
transports were forced, in a very distressed condition, 
into Milford Haven, and were not in a condition to 
put to sea when they left London, and the weather has 
been such since, as to prevent heavy loaded ships from 
making a passage by this time. One or two transports, 
they add, were thought to be lost ; but these arrived 
some considerable time ago at Boston, with three com- 
panies of the 17th regiment. 

Mr. Sayre has been committed to the Tower, upon 
the information of a certain Lieutenant or Adjutant 
Richardson (formerly of your city) for treasonable 
practices ; an intention of seizing his Majesty, and pos- 
sessing himself of the Tower, it is said in " The Crisis." 
But he is admitted to bail himself in five hundred 
pounds, and two sureties in two hundred and fifty- 
pounds each.* 

What are the conjectures of the wise ones with you, 
as to the French armament in the West Indies ? But 
previous to this, is there any certainty of such an arma-

ment ? The captains, who are sensible men, heard 
nothing of this when they left England ; nor does there 
appear any apprehensions on this score in any of the 
measures or speeches of administration. I should think 
the Congress will not, ought not, to adjourn at this im- 
portant crisis. But it is highly necessary, when I am 
at the end of the second sheet of paper, that I should 
adjourn my account of matters to another letter. I 
shall, therefore, in Mrs. Washington's name, thank you 
for your good wishes towards her, and with compli-

* General Schuyler had vTritten to Washington, intimating his desire 
and intention to leave the army, and closing his remarks on the subject as 
follows ; — 

" I have already informed you of the disagreeable situation I have been 
in during the campaign ; but I would waive tliat, were it not tliat it has 
chiefly arisen from prejudice and jealousy ; for I could point out particu- 
lar persons of rank in the army, who have frequently declared, tliat the 
general, commanding in this quarter, ought to be of the colony from 
whence the majority of the troops came. But it is not from opinions or 
principles of individuals, that I have drawn the foUowing conclusion, (hat 
troops from the colony of Connecticut will not bear ivith a general from 
another colony ; it is from the daily and common conversation of all ranks 
of people from that colony, both in and out of the army. And I assure you, 
that I sincerely lament, that people of so much public virtue sliould be 
actuated by such an unbecoming jealousy, founded on such a narrow 
principle ; a principle extremely unfriendly to our righteous cause, as it 
tends to alienate tlie affections of numbers in this colony, in spite of the 
most favorable constructions, that prudent men and real Americans

It was from a full conviction of your zealous attach- 
ment to the cause of our country, and abilities to serve it, 
that I have repeatedly pressed your continuance in com- 
mand ; and it is with much concern, Sir, that I find you 
have reason to think your holding the place you do, will 
be of prejudice and incompatible with its interest. As 
you are of this opinion, the part you are inclined to take 
is certainly generous and noble. But will the good con- 
sequences you intend be derived from it? I greatly 
fear they will not. I shall leave the matter to yourself, 
in full confidence, that in whatever sphere you move, 
your exertions for your country's weal will not be 
wanting. 

Whatever proof you may obtain, fixing or tending to 
support the charge against Mr. Prescott, you will please 
to transmit to me by the first opportunity.* I am apt to 
beheve the intelligence given to Dr. Wheelock, respect- 
ing Major Rogers, was not true;t but being much sus- 
pected of unfriendly views to this country, his conduct 
should be attended to with some degree of vigilance and 
circumspection. 

I confess I am much concerned for General Mont- 
gomery and Colonel Arnold ; and the consequences 
which will result from their miscarriage, should it hap- 
pen, are very alarming ; 1 fear, no less fatal than you 
mention. However, I trust that their distinguished con- 
duct, bravery, and perseverance will meet with the 
smiles of fortune, and put them in possession of that 



amongst us attempt to put upon it. And although I frankly avow, that 
I feel a resentment, yet I shall continue to sacrifice it to a nobler object, 
— the weal of that country in which I have drawn the breath of life, 
resolved ever to seek with unwearied assiduity for opportunities to fulfil 
my duty to it."

important fortress. I wish their force was greater ; the 
reduction would then be certain. 

I am sorry that Ticonderoga and Fort George should 
be left by the garrisons, and that your recruiting offi- 
cers meet with such ill success. It is too much the 
case in this quarter, and from the slow progress made 
in enlisting, I despair of raising an ai-my to the new 
establishment. Should it be effected, it will be a long 
time first. Oia- Caghnawaga friends are not arrived 
yet. I will try to make suitable provision for them 
during their stay, and use every means in my power to 
confirm their favorable disposition towards us. They 
will not, I am fearful, have such ideas of our strength, 
as I could wish. This, however, shall be strongly in- 
culcated.* 

If Quebec is in our possession, I do not see that any 
inconvenience will result from Mr. Gamble's going there 
upon his parole ;t but if it is not, however hurtful it may 
be to him, however disagreeable to me, to prejudice the 
interest of an individual, I cannot consent to his retiu^n. 
I am much distressed by applications of a like nature. 
If Mr. Gamble's request is granted, others in the same 
situation will claim the same indulgence. Further, I 
think a particular exchange should not be made, and my 
proposition for a general one was rejected by Mr. Howe, 
or, what is the same, it was unnoticed. I could wish 
that his application had been to Congress. They might 
have complied with it, had they thought it reasonable. 

I am much pleased that the artillery was likely to be

On reading the copy of General Wooster's letter, I was

TO THE GENERAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY. 

Cambridge, 16 January, 1776. 

Gentlemen, 
Your several resolves, in consequence of my letters, 
j4«-A' - have been presented to me by a committee of your 

' honorable body. I thank you for the assurances of 

being zealously disposed to do every thing in your 
power to facilitate the recruiting of the American army ; 
and, at the same time I assure you that I do not enter- 
tain a doubt of the truth of it, I must beg leave to add, 
that I conceive you have mistaken the meaning of my 
letter of the 10th, if you suppose it ever was my idea, 
that you should offer a bounty at the separate expense 
of this colony. 

It was not clear to me, but that some coercive meas- 
ures might be used on this as on former occasions, to 
draft men to complete the regiments upon the Continen- 
tal establishment. But as this is thought unadvisable, I 
shall rely on your recommending to the selectmen and 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 247 

committees of correspondence to exert themselves in 
their several towns, to promote the enlistments for the 
American army. 

In the mean while, as there is no appearance of 
this service going on but slowly, and it is necessary to 
have a respectable body of troops here as soon as possi- 
ble, to act as circumstances shall requii-e, 1 must beg 
that you will order in, with as much expedition as the 
nature of the case will admit, seven regiments, agreea- 
bly to the establishment of this army, to continue in 
service till the 1st of April, if required. You will be 
pleased to direct, that the men come provided with 
good arms, blankets, kettles for cooking, and if possible 
with twenty rounds of powder and ball. 

With respect to your other resolve relative to arms, 
I am quite ready to make an absolute purchase of such 
as shall be furnished either by the colony or individu- 
als. I am also ready to engage payment for all the 
arms, which shall be furnished by the recruits, if lost 
in the public service ; but I do not know how far I could 
be justified in allowing for the use of them, when I 
know it to be the opinion of Congress, that every man 
shall furnish his own arms, or pay for the use of them 
if put into his hands. To do otherwise is an indirect 
way of raising the pay. I again wish, that the honora- 
ble Court could devise some method of purchasing. 

I beg leave to return my thanks for the kind offer 
of fifty thousand pounds for the Continental use. I will 
accept of a loan, upon the terms mentioned, of half 
that sum to secure payment of the militia, whose time 
of service will be up the last of this month; till 
when I shall not. have occasion to make use of the 
money. I am, with great respect, &lc.*

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 
/ rPlyC^ C . J^l ..V<»*V|J Cambridge, 18 January, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

I received your favor of the 13th instant with its en- 
closures, and am heartily sorry and most sincerely con- 
dole with you upon the fall of the brave and worthy 
Montgomei-y, and those gallant officers and men, who 
have experienced a like fate. 

In the death of this gentleman, America has sustained 
a heavy loss, having approved himself a steady friend 
to her rights, and of ability to render her the most 
essential services. I am much concerned for the in- 
trepid and enterprising Arnold, and greatly fear, that 
consequences of the most alarming nature will result 
from this well intended but unfortunate attempt. It 
would give me the greatest pleasure, if I could be the 
happy means of relieving our fellow citizens now in 
Canada, and preventing the ministerial troops from ex- 

of affairs at this time, may be known by tlie followintf extract from a letter, 
dated on the 16th of January, and written by liim to Lord Dartmouth. 

" From what I can learn of the designs of the leaders of the rebels," 
says General Howe, "they seem determined, since tlie receipt of the 
King's speech among them, to make tlie most diligent preparations for an 
active war; and it is my firm opinion, that they will not retract until 
they have tried their fortune in a battle, and are defeated. But I am 
under the necessity of repeating to your Lordship, that the apparent 
strength of the army for tlie spring does not flatter me with the hopes of 
bi-iiiging the rebels to a decisive action. With a proper army of twenty 
thousand men, having twelve thousand at New York, sLx thousand at 
"I Rhode Island, and two thousand at Halifa.x, e.xclusive of an army for the 

province of Quebec, the present unfavorable appearance of tilings would 
probably wear a very different aspect before the end of the ensuing cam- 
paign. With fewer troops, the success of any offensive operations will 
be very doubtful, the enemy possessing advantages that will not readily 
be overcome by a small force ; neither is tlieir army by any means to be 
despised, having in it many European soldiers, and all or most of the 
young men of spirit in the country, who are exceedingly diligent and 
attentive to their military profession." 



PartII.I the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 249 

ulting long, and availing themselves of the advantages 
arising from this repulse. But it is not in my power. 
Since the dissolution of the old army, the progress in 
raising recruits for the new has been so very slow and 
inconsiderable, that five thousand militia have been 
called in for the defence of our hues. A great part of 
these have gone home again, and the rest have been 
induced to stay with the utmost difficulty and persua- 
sion, though their going would render the holding of the 
lines truly precarious and hazardous, in case of an at- 
tack. In short I have not a man to spare. 

In order that proper measures might be adopted, I 
called a council of general officers, and desired Mr. John 
Adams, and other members of mfluence of the General 
Court to attend, and laid' before them your letter and 
proposition. * 

After due consideration of their importance, they de- 
termined that the Colonies of Massachusetts, New 
Hampshire, and Connecticut should each immediately 
raise a regiment to continue in service for one year, and 
to march forthwith to Canada, agreeably to the route 
proposed in your letter to Congress. This determina- 
tion, with a copy of your letter and the several enclo- 
sures, will be immediately transmitted to the different 
governments for raising these regiments, which I have 
reason to believe will be directly complied with, from the 
assurances I have received from such of the members 
of the General Court as attended in council, and the 
general officers promising to exert their utmost interest 
and influence in their respective colonies. 

If these regiments should not be raised so soon as I 
could wish, yet I would willingly hope, from the ac-

possible despatch, a reinforcement of three thousand men into Canada, by 
the way of Onion River and Lake Champlain.

counts we have received, that Colonel Arnold and his 
corps will be joined by a number of men under Colonel 
Warner, and others from Connecticut, who, it is said, 
marched immediately on getting intelligence of this mel- 
ancholy affair. If this accovmt be true, I trust they will 
be in a situation to oppose and prevent Mr. Carleton from 
regaining possession of what he has lost, and that, upon 
the arrival of the reinforcement, to be sent from these 
colonies, the city of Quebec will be reduced to our 
possession. This must be effected before the winter is 
entirely over, otherwise it will be exceedingly difficult, 
if not impracticable, as the enemy will undoubtedly 
place a strong garrison there. Should this desirable 
work be accomplished, our conquest in that quarter will 
be complete ; but yet the loss of the brave Montgomery 
will ever be remembered. It gives me pleasure to find, 
that you will continue in service, and afford your assist- 
ance to reheve your country from the distresses, which 
at present threaten her in the North. * 

None of the letters gives an account how this unfortu- 
nate affair ended. In Colonel Campbell's letter of the 
31st ultimo, he seems to think Colonel Greene's divis- 
ion was in a very disagreeable situation ; and drawing 
it off at night, or throwing in a party to sustain it, was

attack on Quebec reached them, that nine battalions should be kept up 
and maintained the present year for the defence of Canada. Among 
these was included a battalion of Canadians, to be commanded by Colonel

v'Vo dian regiment, to consist of one thousand men divided into four battalions, 

and commanded by a colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and four majors. Moses 
Hazen was appointed colonel. Both he and Livingston were residents in 
Canada, and took an active part with tlie colonies at the beginning of 
the contest. Hazen was a captain on half pay, and Congress agreed to 
indemnify him for any loss he might sustain by entering into their service.

an object he had much in view. Here he stops. In 
his letter of the 2cl instant he says nothing about it ; but 
I dread further intelligence of the matter. 

General Putnam is of opinion, that it will be better 
for the troops, who may be raised in the western part 
of Connecticut, to go to Albany, than through the route 
you have mentioned by Number Four,* and that you 
pointed out this way upon a supposition, that the rein-

Connecticut, and New Hampshire, to raise each a regi- 
ment, on the Continental account, for this service. I 
wish most ardently, that the urgency of the case would 
have admitted of the delay. I wish, also, that the pur- 
port of General Schuyler's letter had not, unavoidably as 
it were, laid me under an indispensable obligation to do 
it ; for, having informed you in his letter, a copy of which 
he enclosed me, of his dependence on this quarter for 
men, I thought you might also have some reliance on 
my exertions. This consideration, added to my fears 
of the fatal consequences of delay, to an information of 
your having designed three thousand men for Canada, 
to a belief, founded chiefly on General Schuyler's letters, 
that few or none of them were raised, and to my appre- 
hensions for New York, which led me to think, that no 
troops could be spared from that quarter, induced me 
to lose not a moment's time in throwing in a force there ; 
being well assured, that General Carleton will improve 
to the utmost the advantages gained, leaving no artifices 
untried to fix in his interest the Canadians and Indians, 
who, we find, are too well disposed to take part with 
the strongest. 

If these reasons are not sutficient to justify my con- 
duct in the opinion of Congress, if the measure contra- 
venes any resolution of theirs, they will please to coun- 
termand the levying and marching of the regiments as 
soon as possible, and do me the justice to believe, that 
my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred. *

>J Cambridge, 10 January, 1776. 

Gentlemen, ' ^-7 . - . j*. 

The enclosures, herewith sent, convey such full ac- 
counts of the sad reverse of our affairs in Canada, as to /^ ^r J^ 
render it unnecessary for me, in my present hurry, to 
add aught to the tale. 

* A council of war was convened on the 16th of January, in which the 
General stated it to be "in his judgment indispensably necessary to make 
a bold attempt to conquer the ministerial troops in Boston, before they 
could be reinforced in the spring, if the means could be provided, and a 
favorable opportunity should oifer," and he desired tlie opinion of the 
council. It was agreed that sucli an attempt ought to be made, but tliat 
the present force was inadequate ; and the council advised the Comman- 
der-in-chief to request of the neighbouring colonies thirteen regiments of 
militia, to serve till the 1st of April ; that is, from Massachusetts seven 
regiments, Connecticut four, and New Hampshire two. Rhode Island 
was exempted from this call, " on account of the repeated insults of the 
enemy's ships of war, and the exposed situation of the sea-coast of tliat 
colony." 

On the 18th, another council was held to consider tlie letters received 
tlie evening before from Canada, conveying intelligence of the fall of 
Montgomery, and the disaster at Quebec. When the question was put, 
it was resolved to be inexpedient, in the present weakened state of the 
lines, to send a detachment from tlie main army to Canada ; but the Gene- 
ral v.'as advised to request Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hamp-

Your spirited colony will, I have no doubt, be suffi- 
ciently impressed with the expediency of a vigorous 
exertion to prevent the evils, which must follow from the 
repulse of our troops. It does not admit of a doubt, 
but that General Carleton will improve this advantage 
to the utmost ; and, if he should be able to give another 
current of sentiments to the Canadians and Indians, 
than those they seem inclined to adopt, words are un- 
necessary to describe the melancholy effect, which must 
inevitably follow. 

I am persuaded, therefore, that you will exert your- 
selves to the utmost to throw in the reinforcement, which 
is now required of your colony, by the route mentioned 
in General Schuyler's letter ; as the doing of it expe- 
ditiously may prove a matter of the utmost importance. 
You will perceive, by the minutes of the council of war 
enclosed, that the regiment, asked of you for Canada, is 
one of the seven applied for in my letter of the 16th 
instant, and that the only difference, with respect to the 
requisition, is the length of time, and place of service ; 
as no good would result from sending troops to Canada, 
for a shorter period than the Continental army is raised 
for, that is, till the 1st of January, 1777. 

I am. Gentlemen, &,c.* 

shire to raise three regiments witli all possible despatch for the Canada 
expedition, whose time of service should continue till the 1st of January 
following ; and it was decided, tliat these three regiments should be con- 
sidered as a part of the thirteen already required, leaving ten only for the 
army at Cambridge. John Adams, as a member of the Continental Con- 
gress, and being then in Watertown, assisted at both of the above coun- 
cils, by the special invitation of the Commander-in-chief. 

* A letter to the same effect was sent to the Governor of Connecticut, 
and to the President of the Convention of New Hampshire. This requi- 
sition had been anticipated by Connecticut ; for, as soon as the intelligence 
from Canada reached that colony, and before General Washington's letter 
was received. Governor Trumbull convened the Council of Safety, and 
they resolved to raise a regiment of seven hundred and fifty men to rein- 
force the army in Canada.

Sir, (E^n^v^, 

I received your favor of the" 16th instant, and am ex- , i (?fiLfUA^ > 

ceedingly sorry to hear, that Congress countermanded '-a^^^O ■ 
the embarkation of the two regiments intended against 
the Tories on Long Island.* They, I doubt not, had 
^, their reasons ; but to me it appears, that the period is 
P' arrived, when nothing less than the most decisive and 

vigorous measures should be pursued. Our enemies, 
from the other side of the Atlantic, will be sufficiently 
numerous ; it highly concerns us to have as few internal 
ones as possible. As Congress seem to have altered 
their views in this instance, and the men, who went 
with you from Connecticut, are upon a very different 
footing from what I expected, it will be right to give 
Congress the earliest notice of your proceedings, and 
to disband your troops as soon as you think circumstan- 
ces will admit of it.f 

In consequence of the melancholy reverse of our 
affairs in Canada, an application was made to me for 
succour, and happy should I have been, if the situation 
of this army could have afforded it. All I could do was 
to lay the matter before this and the governments of 
Connecticut and New Hampshire, and urge the expe- 
diency and necessity of their sending thither a reinforce- 
ment of three regiments immediately. Mr. Trumbull 
and his Council of Safety had anticipated my request. 
The other two colonies have adopted the measure. 
The three regiments are now raising, and, I would wil- 
lingly hope, will arrive in time to reinstate matters in

also to spare me some powder if he possibly can.* You 
know our stock of this necessary article is inconsidera- 
ble, and you know, too, that we have a demand for a 
further supply. 

The progress in raising recruits for the new army 
being very slow, I have applied to this colony, Connecti- 
cut, and New Hampshire, for ten regiments of militia, 
to continue in service till the 1st of April next, which 
they have granted me. As soon as they come in, and 
I can get provided with proper means, I am determined 
to attempt something. Of this I would have you take 
no notice. 

Within a few days past several persons have come 
out of Boston. They all agree, that General Clinton is 
gone upon some expedition. Some say he has between 
four and five hundred men, others, part of two regi- 
ments. What his force consists of is not precisely 
known ; but I am almost certain he has gone with some. 
His destination nmst be south of this, and very proba-

scheme for raising a battalion, to consist of four regiments, and on the 
30th of that month Alexander M'^Dougall was appointed colonel of the 
first regiment. He had been extremely zealous in the cause of liberty, 
acting at an early hour a bold and decided part, by a correspondence 
with leaders in the other colonies, and by promoting efficient measures 
in New York. Two or three years before, he had been imprisoned by 
the old colonial Assembly, on suspicion of writing and publishing his 
sentiments too freely concerning the character and deliberations of that 
body. His principles and conduct throughout the war accorded witli 
these early pledges of fidelity to his country's interests.

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 23 January, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 
Real necessity compels me to ask you, whether I 
may entertain any hopes of your returning to my family. 
If you can make it convenient, and will hint the matter to 
Colonel Harrison,* I dare venture to say, that Congress 
will make it agreeable to you in every shape they can. 
My business increases very fast, and my distresses for 
want of you increase with it. Mr. Harrison is the only 
gentleman of my family, that can afford me the least 
assistance in writing. He and Mr. Moylan, whose time 
must now be solely employed in his department of com- 
missary, have heretofore afforded me their aid ; and I 
have hinted to them in consequence of what you signi- 
fied in some former letter, that, as they have really had 
a great deal of trouble, each of them should receive 
one third of your pay, reserving the other third con- 
trary to your desire for yourself. My distress and em- 
barrassment ai'e in a way of being very considerably 
increased by an occurrence in Virginia, which will, I 
fear, compel Mr. Harrison to leave me, or suffer con- 
siderably by his stay. He has written, however, by 
the last post to ascertain if his return cannot be dis- 
pensed with. If he should go, I shall really be dis-

tressed beyond measure, as I know no persons able to 
supply your places, in this part of the world, with whom 
I would choose to live in unbounded confidence. 

The business, as I hinted to you before, is considera- 
bly increased, by being more comprehensive, and at this 
time perplexed by the great changes which are happen- 
ing every day ; so that you would want a good writer 
and a methodical man, as an assistant, or copying clerk. 
Such a one I have no doubt will be allowed, and the 
choice I leave to yourself, as he should be a person in 
whose integrity you can confide, and on whose capacity, 
care, and method you can rely. At present, my time 
is so much taken up at my desk, that I am obliged to 
neglect many other essential parts of my duty. It is 
absolutely necessary, therefore, to have persons that can 
think for me, as well as execute orders. As it may be 
essendal that the pay ot the under-secretary should be 
fixed, that you may, if you incline to return and should 
engage one, know what to promise him, I have written 
to Colonel Harrison and Mr. Lynch on this subject. 

I am, &.C.

■ ' ' I take the liberty of recommending the expediency, 

indeed the absolute necessity, of appointing fit and 
proper persons to setde the accounts of this army. To 
^ do it with precision requires time, care, and attention. 

The longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will 
be, the more liable to error, and diflicult to explain and 
recdfy ; as also the persons in whose hands they are, if 
disposed to take undue advantage, will be less subject

to detection. I have been as attentive, as the nature ol' 
my office would admit, in granting warrants for money 
on the paymaster ; but it would be absolutely impossi- 
ble for me to go into an examination of all the accounts 
incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to 
them, without devoting so large a portion of my time 
to the business, as might not only prove injurious, but 
fatal to it in other respects. This ought, in my humble 
opinion, to be tlie particular business of a select com- 
mittee of Congress, or one appointed by them, who, 
once in three months at farthest, should make a setde- 
ment with the officers in the different departments. 

Having met with no encouragement from the govern- 
ments of Massachusetts and New Hamphire, as to my 
appHcation for arms, and expecting no better from Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island, I have, as the last expedi- 
ent, sent one or two officers from each regiment into 
the country, with money to try if they can buy. In what 
manner they may succeed. Congress shall be informed 
as soon as they return. Congress, in my last, would 
discover my motives for strengthening these lines with 
the militia ; but whether, as the weather turns out ex- 
ceedingly mild, insomuch as to promise nothing favora- 
ble from ice, and as there is no appearance of powder, 
I shall be able to attempt any thing decisive, time only 
can determine. No man upon earth wishes more ar- 
dently to destroy the nest in Boston, than I do ; no per- 
son would be willing to go greater lengths than I shall, 
to accomplish it, if it shall be thought advisable. But 
if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to 
pass on, we shall be in no better situation than we have 
been in all the year ; we shall be worse, because their 
works are stronger. 

I have accounts from Boston, which I think may be 
relied on, that General Clinton, with about four or five 



b-i- 



260 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

hundred men, has left that place within these four days. 
Whether this is part of the detachment, which was 
making up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth 
instant, and then at Nantasket) or not, it is not in my 
power to say. If it is designed for New York or Long 
Island, as some think, throwing in a body of troops 
there may prove a fortunate circumstance. If they go 
farther south, agreeably to the conjectures of others, I 
hope there will be men to receive them. 

Congress will think me a htde remiss, I fear, when I 
inform them, that I have done nothing yet towards rais- 
ing the battalion of marines ; but I hope to stand ex- 
culpated from blame, when they hear the reason, which 
was, that already having twenty-six incomplete regi- 
ments, I thought it would be adding to an expense, 
already great, in officers, to set two entire coi'ps of 
officers on foot, when perhaps we should not add ten 
men a week by it to our present numbers. In this 
opinion the general officers have concurred, which in- 
duced me to suspend the matter a little longer. Our 
enlistments, for the two last weeks, have not amounted 
to a thousand men, and are diminishing. The regiment 
for Canada, it is thought, will soon be filled, as the men 
are to choose all but their field-officers, who are ap- 
pointed by the Court. 

On Sunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnawaga In- 
dians arrived here on a visit. I shall take care that 
they be so entertained during their stay, that they may 
return impressed with sentiments of friendship for us, 
and also of our great strength. One of them is Colonel 
Louis, who honored me with a visit once before. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. , '^yiyu) p 

Cambridge, 27 January, 1776. / 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 22d enclosing Colonel Arnold's 
letter of the 2d, explaining the doubt we were in 
respecting his detachment, is received. Happy would 
it have been for our cause, if that party could have got 
out of the city of Quebec ;* as I am much afraid by the 
complexion of the letters from that place, that there is 
little hope of Arnold's continuing the blockade without 
assistance from Wooster, which he is determined not to 
give, whether with propriety or not, I shall not at this 
distance undertake to decide. 

The sad reverse of our aifairs in that quarter calls 
loudly for every exertion in your power, to restore them 
to the promising aspect they so lately wore. For this 
reason, notwithstanding you think the necessity of troops 
from hence is in some measure superseded, I will not 
countermand the order and appointment of officers, 
which are gone forth from this government, Connecticut, 
and New Hampshire, for raising a regiment each, till 
Congress, who are informed of it, shall have decided 
upon the measure. 

I consider, that the important period is now arrived, 
when the Canadians and consequently their Indians 
must take a side. Should any indecisive operations 
of ours, therefore, give the bias against us, it is much 
easier to foresee, than to rectify, the dreadful conse- 
quences, which must inevitably follow from it. I con- 
sider, also, that the reinforcement, under the command 
of Colonel Warner, and such other spirited men as have 
left the western parts of the New England governments, 

* The party of troops that attacked the city under Arnold, the most of 
whom were taken prisoners. 



262 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

is only temporary, and may fail when most wanted ; as 
we find it next to impossible to detain men, not fast 
bound, in service, after they get a htde tired of the du- 
ties of it and homesick. 

These, my dear Sir, are the great outlines which 
govern me in this affair. If Congress mark them as 
strongly as I do, they will not wish to starve the cause 
at so critical a period. If they think differently, they 
will direct accordingly, and I must stand corrected for 
the error my zeal has led me into. 

Colonel Porter, said to be an exceedingly active man, 
is appointed to the command of the regiment from this 
government; Colonel Burrell to the one from Connecti- 
cut ; and Colonel Bedel to that from New Hampshire. 
The two last are represented to me as men of spirit 
and influence ; so that, from these accounts, I have no 
doubt of their getting into Canada in a very short time, 
as I have endeavoured to excite a spirit of emulation. 
I wish most ardendy, that the state of your health may 
permit you to meet them there. The possession of Que- 
bec, and the entire reduction of Canada this winter, so as 
to have leisure to prepare for the defence of it in the 
spring, is of such great and extensive importance to the 
well-being of America, that I wish to see matters under 
the direction, — but I will say no more, you will come 
at my meaning. 

I am a litUe embarrassed to know in what manner to 
conduct myself with respect to the Caghnawaga Indians 
now here. They have, notwithstanding the treaty of 
neutraUty, which I find they entered into with you the 
other day, agreeably to what appears to be the sense oi' 
Congress, signified to me a desire of taking up arms in 
behalf of the United Colonies. The Chief of them, 
who I understand is now the first man of the nation, 
intends, as it is intimated, to apply to me for a commis- 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 263 

sion, with the assurance of raising four or five hundred 
men when he returns. My embarrassment does not 
proceed so much from the impropriety of encouraging 
these people to depart from their neutrality, or rather 
accepting their own voluntary offer, as from the ex- 
pense, which probably may follow. I am sensible, that, 
if they do not desire to be idle, they will be for or 
against us. I am sensible, also, that no artifices will be 
left unessayed to engage them against us. Their prof- 
fered services, therefore, ought not to be rejected ; but 
how far, with the little knowledge I have of their policy 
and real intentions, and your want of their aid, I ought 
to go, is the question that puzzles me. I will endeavour, 
how'ever, to please them by yielding in appearance to 
their demands ; reserving, at the same time, the power 
in you to regulate their numbers and movements, of 
which you shall be more fully informed when any thing 
is fixed.* 

I congratulate you upon the success of your expedi- 
tion into Tryon county. I hope General Lee will exe- 
cute a work of the same kind on Long Island. It is 
high time to begin with our internal foes, when we are 
threatened with such severity of chastisement from our 
kind parent without. That the Supreme Dispenser of 
every good may bestow health, strength, and spirit on 
you and your army, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, your 
most affectionate and obedient servant. 

* General Schuyler replied in regard to these Indians; — "It is ex- 
tremely difficult to determine what should be done, in what you mention 
respecting the ofter made by the Caghnawaga Indians ; but if we can get 
decently rid of their offer, I %vould prefer it to employing them. The ex- 
pense we are at iu the Indian department is now amazing ; it will be more 
so when they consider themselves as in our service ; nor would their in- 
tervention be of much consequence, unless we could procure that of the 
other nations. The hauteur of the Indians is much diminished since the 
taking of Montreal ; they evidently see that they cannot get any supplies 
but through us."

TO COLONEL BENEDICT ARNOLD. 

Cambridge, 27 Janua'y, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

On the 17th instant I received the melancholy ac- 
count of the unfortunate attack on the city of Quebec, 
attended with the fall of General Montgomery and other 
brave officers and men, and of your being wounded. 
This unhappy affair affects me in a very sensible man- 
ner, and I sincerely condole with you upon the occasion ; 
but, in the midst of distress, I am happy to find, that 
suitable honors were paid to the remains of Mr. Mont- 
gomery ; and that our officers and soldiers, who have 
fallen into their hands, were treated with kindness and 
humanity.* 

Having received no intelligence later than the copy 
of your letter of the 2d to General Wooster, I would 
fain hope, that you are not in a worse situation than you 

* During the night of the attack on Quebec there was a tempestuous 
snow-storm. The bodies of the persons slain under the cliff of Cape 
Diamond were not discovered till morning, when they were found nearly 
enveloped in snow. They were taken into the city on a sled. Three of 
them were known to be officers, and from the initials R. M. written in a. 
fur cap, picked up at the place of the bloody catastrophe, it was conjec- 
tured to have belonged to General Montgomery. His features were 
disfigured by a wound, which he had received in tlie lower part of the 
head and neck. At length a woman and a boy were brought, who had 
lately come into the city from the American camp, and who had oflen 
seen the principal officers. They identified the bodies of iMontgomery, 
Captain M^Pherson, Captain Cheesman, and an orderly sergeant. 

Mr. Cramahe, an officer in the British army, and for a time lieutenant- 
governor of Canada, had served in the late war witli Montgomery, and 
entertained for him a warm personal attachment. He asked permission 
of General Carleton to bury his friend with marks of honor and respect. 
This was granted in part, and a coffin lined and covered with black was 
provided. But tlie Governor did not consent to the reading of the funeral 
service, probably not deeming this indulgence conformable to military rules. 
But when the time of burial approached, Mr. Cramahe invited a clergy- 
man to be present, who read the service privately and unmolested. The 
other officers were buried at a short distance fr im tlieir gei ?ral, but 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 265 

then were ; though, I confess, I have greatly feared, 
that those misfortunes would be succeeded by others, 
on account of your unhappy condition, and the dis- 
pirited state of the officers and men. If they have 
not, I trust that when you are joined by three regi- 
ments now raising in this and the governments of Con- 
necticut and New Hampshire, and two others ordered 
by the Congress from Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, 
with the men already sent off by Colonel Warner, 
these misfortunes will be done away, and things will 
resume a more favorable and promising appearance 
than ever. 

I need not mention to you the great importance of 
this place, and the consequent possession of all Canada, 
in the scale of American affairs. You are well ap- 
prized of it. To whomsoever it belongs, in their favor, 
probably, will the balance turn. If it is in ours, success 
I think will most certainly crown our virtuous struggles. 
If it is in theirs, the contest at best will be doubtful, haz- 
ardous, and bloody. The glorious work must be accom- 
plished in the course of this winter, otherwise it will be- 
come difficult, most probably impracticable ; for adminis- 
tration, knowing that it will be impossible ever to reduce 
us to a state of slavery and arbitrary rule without it, will 
certainly send a large reinforcement thither in the spring. 
I am fully convinced, that your exertions will be invaria- 
bly directed to this grand object, and I already view the 
approaching day, when you and your brave followers 
will enter this important fortress, with every honor 

without coffins, and in the military manner. All the graves were within 
the walls of the city, and near the Port of St. Louis. 

These particulars were communicated to me by Mr. William Smith of 
Quebec, who had received them from several persons acquainted with 
them at tlie time, and especially from Mr. Thompson, who assisted at the 
burial of Montgomery, and who pointed out the place of his grave a few 
years ago, when his remains were taken up and removed to New York.

attendant on victory. Then will you have added the 
only link wanting in the great chain of Continental 
union, and render the freedom of your country secure. 
Wishing you a speedy recovery, and the possession 
of those laurels, which your bravery and perseverance 
justly merit, I am, dear Sir, yours, &.c. * 



TO COMMODORE JOHN MANLY. 

Cambridge, 28 January, 1776. 

Sir, 
I received your agreeable letter of the 26th instant, 
giving an account of your having taken and carried into 
Plymouth two of the enemy's transports. Your con- 
duct in engaging the eight-gun schooner, with so few 
hands as you went out with, your attention in securing 
your prizes, and your general good behaviour since you 
first engaged in the service, merit my own and your 
country's thanks. 

* Arnold wrote from Quebec, on the 27th of February, in reply to this 
letter, and seemed in high spirits, though encompassed with innumerable 
difficulties. His mind was of so elastic a nature, that the more it was 
pressed, the greater was its power of resistance. Congress had recently 
promoted him to the rank of brigadier-general, as a reward for his good 
conduct, during the perilous enterprise in which he had been engaged 
from the time he lefl Cambridge, till he was wounded in tlie unsuccessful 
assault on Quebec. " The severity of the climate," he observes, " the 
troops very ill clad and worse paid, the trouble of reconciling matters 
among the inhabitants, and lately an uneasiness among some of the New 
York and other officers, who think themselves neglected in the new ar- 
rangement, while those who deserted the cause and went home last fall 
have been promoted ; in short, the choice of difficulties I have had to en- 
counter has rendered affairs so very perplexing, that I have often been at 
a loss how to conduct them." He alludes here, and perliaps with some 
justice, to the case of Colonel Enos, and his officers, who deserted him in 
the wilderness on their way to Canada, but who were nevertheless retain- 
ed and promoted in the new establishment.

You may be assured, that every attention will be paid 
to any reasonable request of yours, and that you shall 
have the command of a stronger vessel of war ; but as 
it will take up some time before such a one can be fitted 
out, my desire is, that you continue in the Hancock 
until the end of the cruise. When that is out, you will 
come to Head-Quarters, and we will confer together on 
the subject of the other ship. I wish you could engage 
men at Plymouth to make your complement at least forty 
strong. It would enable you to encounter the small 
tenders, that may fall in your way ; though I would 
rather have you avoid an engagement, until you have a 
ship, that will place you upon a more equal footing with 
your enemy. I need not recommend to you to proceed 
again and pursue your good fortune. 

I wish you could inspire the captains of the other 
armed schooners under your command with some of 
your activity and industry. Can you not appoint sta- 
tions for them, where they may have the best chance of 
intercepting supplies going to the enemy ? They dare 
not disobey your orders, as it is mentioned in the in- 
structions I have given to each of them, that they are 
to be under your command as commodore ; and as such 
I desire that you will give them such instructions in 
writing, as to you will appear proper for the good of 
the service. I am, Sir, wishing you a continuance of 
success, yours, &c.

' the present interesting contest, and the relief our friends 

there stand in need of, I should be happy, were it in 
my power, to detach a battalion from this camp ; but it 
cannot be done. On the 19 th instant, I had the honor 
to write to you a letter, which will fully convey the 
resolutions of a council of war, and the sentiments of 
the general officers here, as to the propriety and expe- 
diency of sending troops from these lines, for the de- 
fence of which we have been and now are obliged to 
call in the militia ; to which I beg leave to refer you. 
You may rest assured, that my endeavours and exer- 
tions shall not be wanting, to stimulate the governments 
of Connecticut and New Hampshire to raise and for- 
ward reinforcements as fast as possible ; nor in any other 
instance that will promote the expedition.* 

I shall, in obedience to the order of Congress, though 
interdicted by General Howe, propose an exchange of 

* The generous and humane conduct of General Carleton, in regard 
to the persons taken at the unfortunate assault on Quebec, ought not to 
be overlooked. Although he had acquiesced in the harsh treatment of 
Ethan Allen, yet the prisoners who fell into his hands on the above disas- 
trous occasion, according to their own account, met with a usage in every 
respect as good as that of the British soldiers, except in tlie necessary 
restraints of confinement. This was declared in a letter to Washington 
from Major Meigs, when he returned on his parole the summer following. 
The soldiers were confined in the Jesuits' College, and the officers in the 
Seminary. The latter, after the siege was raised, had permission to walk 
in a large garden adjoining their quarters. Major Meigs left three hun- 
dred prisoners in Quebec, about tlie middle of May. When they were 
released for exchange. General Carleton supplied them with articles of 
clothing, in which they were deficient. It was said, that when some of 
his officers spoke to him of this act, as an unusual degree of lenity to- 
wards prisoners of war, he replied, — "Since we have tried in vain to 
make them acknowledge us as brotliers, let us at least send them away 
disposed to regard us as first cousins." Having been informed, that many 
persons suffering from wounds and various disorders were concealed in

put in the tree, and covered over. He probably has 
exchanged his saddle, or withdrawn the papers when 
it was mended, as you conjecture. Those that have 
been discovered are sufficiently bad ; but I doubt not 
of the others being worse, and containing more dia- 
bolical and extensive plans. I hope he will be taken

as their health should be restored, they should have free liberty to return 
to their respective provinces." 

Posterity has done justice to the humane character of Genera] Carle-

was concerned, are remembered with more respect, even in the country 
of his foes.

generals two aids each, to rank as majors.

I shall appoint officers in the places of those, who 
are in Canada, as I am fully persuaded they will wish 
to continue there, for making our conquest complete in 
that quarter. I wish their bravery and valor may be 
attended with the smiles of fortune. I wish it was in 
my power to furnish Congress with such a general as 
they desire, to send to Canada. Since the unhappy 
reverse of our affairs in that quarter, General Schuyler 
has informed me, that, though he had thoughts of de- 
clining the service before, he would now act. My 
letter of the 1 1 th will inform them of General Lee's 
being at New York. He will be ready to obey their 
orders, should they incline to send him ; but, if I am 
not greatly deceived, he or some other spirited, able 
officer will be wanted there in the spring, if not sooner ; 
as we have undoubted intelligence, that General Clinton 
has sailed with some troops. The reports of their 
number are various, from between four and five hundred 
to nineteen companies of grenadiers and light infantry. 
It is also imagined, that the regiments, which were to 
sail the 1st of December, are intended for that place or 
Virginia. General Putnam is a most valuable man, 
and a fine executive officer ; but I do not know how 
he would conduct in a separate department. He is a 
younger major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I 
have observed, having determined to continue in the 
service, will, I expect, repair into Canada. A copy of 
my letter to him on this and other subjects, I enclose to 
you, as it will explain my motives for not stopping the 
regiments from these governments. 

When Captain Cochran arrives, I will give him every 
assistance in my power, in obedience to the orders of 
Congress ; but I fear it will be the means of laying up 
our own vessels, as these people will not bear the dis- 
tinction. Should this be the consequence, it will be

highly prejudicial to us, as we sometimes pick up their 
provision-vessels, and may continue to distress them in 
this way. Last week Captain Manly took a ship and a 
brig bound to Boston from Whitehaven, with coals chief- 
ly and some potatoes for the army. I have, for his 
great vigilance and industry, appointed him commodore 
of our httle squadron ; and he now hoists his flag on 
board the schooner Hancock. g ^ 

I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith,* and ^ 
am exceedingly glad to hear of the measures Congress (Tl^^^vj,,; ••■^ loJuaj 
are taking for the general defence of the continent. .^' / . v?j". 

The clouds thicken fast ; where they will burst, I know 
not ; but we should be armed at all points. 

I have not succeeded in my applications to these 
governments for arms. They have returned for answer, 
that they cannot furnish any. Whether I shall be 
more lucky in the last resource left me in this quarter, 
I cannot determine, not having received returns from 
the officers sent out to purchase of the people. I 
greatly fear, that but very few will be procured in this 
way, as they are exceedingly scarce, and but a small 
part of what there are, fit for service. When they 
make their report, you shall be informed.

have no doubt of its being true. I could wish them to 
be discovered, as 1 think they contain some curious and 
extraordinary plans. In my letter of the 24th instant, 
I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnawaga 
friends. They honored me with a talk to-day, as did 
three of the tribes of St. John's and Passamaquoddy 
Indians, copies of which I beg leave to enclose you. I 
shall write to General Schuyler respecting the tender 
of service made by the former, and not to call for their 
assistance, unless he shall at any time want it, or be 
under the necessity of doing it to prevent their taking 
the side of our enemies. 

I had the honor of writmg to you on the 19th of No- 
vember, and then I informed you of having engaged 
two persons to go to Nova Scotia on the business 
recommended in your letter of the 10th ; and also that 
the state of the army would not then admit of a sufficient 
force being sent, for carrying into execution the views 
of Congress respecting the dock-yards. I would now 
beg leave to mention, that, if the persons sent for infor- 
mation should report favorably of the expediency and 
practicability of the measure, it will not be in my power 
to detach any men from these hnes. The situation of 
our affairs Avill not allow it. I think it would be ad- 
visable to raise them in the eastern parts of this govern- 
ment. If it is attempted, it must be by people from 
that country. A Colonel Thompson, a member of the 
General Court from the province of Maine, and who is 
well spoken of by the Court, and a Captain O'Brien 
have been with me. They think the men necessary 
may be easily engaged there, and the measure practica- 
ble. Provided there are not more than two hundred 
British troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to 
embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their 
plan, which I enclose to you. I would wish you to ad-

vert to the considerations inducing them to the expedi- 
tion, as I am not without apprehension, should it be 
undertaken upon their plan, that the innocent and guilty 
will be involved in one common ruin. I presume they 
do not expect to receive more from the Continent, than 
the five or ten tliousand pounds mentioned in their 
scheme, and to be at every expense. If we had men 
to spare, it might be undertaken for less than either, I 
conceive. Perhaps, if Congress do not adopt their 
proposition, they will undertake to raise men for that 
particular purpose, who may be disbanded as soon as it 
is effected, and upon the same terms that are allowed 
the Continental troops in general. Whatever may be 
the determination of Congress upon the subject, you 
will please to communicate it to me immediately ; for 
the season most favorable for the enterprise is advancing 
fast ; and we may expect in the spring, that there will 
be more troops there, and the measure be more difficult 
to execute. I have the honor to be, &,c. .

Dear Sir, 

I WTote to you the 23d instant, and then informed 
you, that General Clinton had gone upon some expedi- 
tion with four or five hundred men. There is good 
reason to believe, that Tryon has applied for some 
troops, and that he would join them with a great num- 
ber of inhabitants ; so that you will see the necessity 
of your being decisive and expeditious in your opera- 
tions in that quarter. The Tories should be disarmed 
immediately, though it is probable that they may have 
secured their arms on board the King's ships, until call-

ed upon to use them against us. However, you can 
seize upon the persons of the principals. They must 
be so notoriously known, that there will be little clanger 
of your committing mistakes, and happy should I be if 
the Governor could be one of them. 

Since writing the above, your favor of the 24th has 
come to hand, with the sundry enclosures, which I have 
Avith attention perused, and very much approve of your 
conduct. I sincerely wish that the letter you expect to 
receive from Congress may empower you to act con- 
formably to your own and my sentiments on this occa- 
sion. If they should order differently, we must submit, 
as they doubdess will have good reasons for what they 
may determine.* 

The Congress desire I should send an active general 
to Canada. I fancy, when they made the demand, that 
they did not think General Schuyler would continue in 
that station, which he has given me to understand, in 
some late letters from him, that he would. Should they 
not approve of the New York expedition, and think 
another general necessary for the northern department, 
it is probable they will fix on you to take the command 
there. I should be sorry to have you removed so far from 
this scene ; but if the service there requires your pres- 
ence, it will be a fine field for the exertion of your ad- 
mirable talents. There is nothing new here. Let me 
hear often from you, and believe me, &c. 

* General Lee was Inow' at Stamford, in Connecticut, where he was 
preparing to enter New York with such troops as he had collected. In 
his letter to Congress from Stamford, he had strongly urged the expe- 
diency of disarming the Tories, requiring an oath of them to act offen- 
sively and defensively in support of the common rights, and a pledge of 
one half of their property as a security for their good behaviour.

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 31 January, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

In my last, by Mr. John Adams, I communicated my 
distresses to you on account of my want of your 
assistance. I have since been under some concern 
at having done it, lest it should precipitate your re- 
turn before you are ready for it, or bring on a final 
resignation, which I am unwilling to think of, if your re- 
turn can be made convenient and agreeable. True it 
is, that from a variety of causes my business has been, 
and now is, multiplied and perplexed ; whilst the means 
of execution are greatly contracted. This may be a 
cause for my wishing you here, but no inducement to 
your coming, if you hesitated before. 

I have now to thank you for your favors, and for the 
several articles of intelligence, which they convey. The 
account given of your navy, at the same time that it is 
exceedingly unfavorable to our wishes, is a litde pro- 
voking to me, inasmuch as it has deprived us of neces- 
sary articles, which otherwise would have been sent 
hither ; but which a kind of fatality I fear will for ever 
deprive us of.* In the instance of New York, we are 
not to receive a particle of what you expected would 
be sent from thence ; the time and season passing aAvay, 
as I believe the troops in Boston also will, before the 
season for taking the field arrives. I dare say they are 
preparing for it now, as we have undoubted intelligence 
of Clinton's leaving Boston with a number of troops, 
believed to be designed for Long Island, or New York, 
in consequence of assurances from Governor Tryon of 
powerful aid from the Tories there. 

* Armed vessels were now fitting out in Philadelpliia by order of the 
Continental Congress, under the command of Commodore Hopkins. 



276 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^r. 43. 

I hope my countrymen of Virginia will rise superior 
to any losses the wliole navy of Great Britain can bring 
on them, and that the destruction of Norfolk, and the 
attempted devastation of other places, will have no other 
effect, than to unite the whole country in one indissolu- 
ble bond. A few more of such flaming arguments, as 
were exhibited at Falmouth and Norfolk,* added to 
the sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning con- 
tained in the pamphlet " Common Sense," will not leave 
numbers at a loss to decide upon the propriety of a 
separation. 

By a letter of the 21st instant from General Wooster, 
I find, that Arnold was continuing the blockade of Que- 
bec on the 19th, which, under the heaviness of our loss 
there, is a most favorable circumstance, and exhibits a 
fresh proof of Arnold's ability and perseverance in the 
midst of difficulties. The reinforcement ordered to him 
will, I hope, complete the entire conquest of Canada 
this winter ; and except for the loss of the gallant chief, 
and his brave followers, I should think the rebuff rather 
favorable than otherwise ; for had the country been sub- 
dued by such a handful of men, it is more than proba- 
ble, that it would have been left to the defence of a few, 
and rescued from us in the spring. Our eyes will now 
be open not only to the importance of holding it, but to 
the numbers which are requisite to that end. 

In my last I think I informed you of my sending 
General Lee to New York, with the intention of securing 
the Tories on Long Island, and preventing, if possi- 
ble, the King's troops from making a lodgment there ; 
but I fear the Congress will be duped by the represen- 
tations from that government, or yield to them in such a 
manner as to become marplots to the expedition. The

city seems to be entirely under the government of Try- 
on and the captain of the man-of-war. 

Mrs. Washington desires me to thank you for the j f> Hju^ja Cv 



picture sent her. Mr. Campbell, whom I never saw, to 
my knowledge, has made a very formidable figure of 
the Commander-in-chief, giving him a sufficient portion 
of terror in his countenance. Mrs. Washington also 
desires her compliments to Mrs. Reed, as I do, and, 
with the sincerest regard and affection, I remain, dear 
Sir, your most obedient servant. 

P. S. I had written the letter herewith enclosed be- 
fore your favor of the 21st came to hand. The account 
given of the behaviour of the men under General Mont- 
gomery, is exactly consonant to the opinion I have 
formed of these people, and such as they will exhibit 
abundant proofs of, in similar cases whenever called 
upon. Place them behind a parapet, a breast-work, 
stone wall, or any thing that will afford them shelter, 
and, from their knowledge of a firelock, they will give a 
good account of the enemy; but I am as well con- 
vinced, as if I had seen it, that they will not march 
boldly up to a work, nor stand exposed in a plain ; and 
yet, if we are furnished with the means, and the weather 
will afford us a passage, and we can get in men, for 
these three things are necessary, something must be 
attempted. The men must be brought to face danger ; 
they cannot always have an intrenchment or a stone 
wall as a safeguard or shield ; and it is of essential im- 
portance, that the troops in Boston should be destroyed 
if possible before they can be reinforced or removed. 
This is clearly my opinion. Whether circumstances 
will admit of the trial, and, if tried, what will be the 
result, the All- wise Disposer of events alone can tell.

278 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 43. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

The purport of this letter will be directed to a single 
object. Through 3'ou I mean to lay it before Congress, 
and, at the same time that I beg their serious attention 
to the subject, to ask pardon for intruding an opinion, 
not only unasked, but, in some measure, repugnant to 
their resolves. 

The disadvantages attending the hmited enlistment 
of troops are too apparent to those, who are eyewit- 
nesses of them, to render any animadversions necessa- 
ry ; but to gentlemen at a distance, whose attention is 
engrossed by a thousand important objects, the case 
may be otherwise. That this cause precipitated the 
fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented General 
Montgomery, and brought on the defeat, which followed 
thereupon, I have not the most distant doubt ; for, had 
he not been apprehensive of the troops leaving him at 
so important a crisis, but continued the blockade of Que- 
bec, a capitulation, from the best accounts I have been 
able to collect, must inevitably have followed. And that 
we were not at one time obliged to dispute these lines, 
under disadvantageous circumstances, proceeding from 
the same cause, to wit, the troops disbanding of them- 
selves before the miUda could be got in, is to me a mat- 
ter of wonder and astonishment, and proves, that Gene- 
ral Howe was either unacquainted with our situation, or 
restrained by his instructions from putting any thing to 
hazard, till his reinforcements should arrive. 

The instance of General Montgomery (I mention it, 
because it is a striking one, for a number of others 
might be adduced) proves, that, instead of having men 
to take advantage of circumstances, you are in a manner 



Pakt II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 279 

compelled, right or wrong, to make circumstances yield 
to a secondary consideration. Since the 1st of De- 
cember, I have been devising every means in my power 
to secure these encampments ; and though I am sensi- 
ble that we never have, since that period, been able to 
act upon the offensive, and at times not in a condition 
to defend, yet the cost of marching home one set of 
men, bringing in another, the havoc and waste occasion- 
ed by the first, the repairs necessary for the second, 
with a thousand incidental charges and inconveniences, 
which have arisen, and which it is scarce possible either 
to recollect or describe, amount to near as much, as the 
keeping up a respectable body of troops the whole time, 
ready for any emergency, would have done. To this 
may be added, that you never can have a well disci- 
plined army. 

To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties 
of a soldier, requires time. To bring them under proper 
discipline and subordination, not only requires time, but 
is a work of great difficulty, and, in this army, where 
there is so little distinction between the officers and 
soldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. 
To expect, then, the same service from raw and undis- 
cipfined recruits, as from veteran soldiers, is to expect 
what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men, 
who are familiarized to danger, meet it without shrink- 
ing ; whereas troops unused to service often apprehend 
danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men 
to a regular discharge of their duty in time of action ; 
natural bravery, hope of reward, and fear of punish- 
ment. The two first are common to the untutored and 
the discipliri^d soldier ; but the last most obviously dis- 
tinguishes the one from the other. A coward, when 
taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and aban- 
dons his colors, he will be punished with death by his 



280 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 43. 

own party, will take his chance against the enemy ; but 
a man, who thinks little of the one, and is fearful of the 
other, acts from present feelings, regardless of conse- 
quences. 

Again, men of a day's standing will not look forward ; 
and from experience we find, that, as the time ap- 
proaches for their discharge, they grow careless of their 
arms, ammunition, and camp utensils. Nay, even the 
barracks themselves have felt uncommon marks of wan- 
ton depredation, and lay us under fresh trouble and 
additional expense in providing for every fresh set, 
when we find it next to impossible to procure such 
articles, as are absolutely necessary in the first instance. 
To this may be added the seasoning, which new recruits 
must have to a camp, and the loss consequent there- 
upon. But this is not all. Men engaged for a short and 
limited time only, have the officers too much in their 
power ; for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to 
induce a second enlistment, a kind of familiarity takes 
place, which brings on a relaxation of discipline, unli- 
censed furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible 
with order and good government ; by which means the 
latter part of the time, for which the soldier was engaged, 
is spent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate 
in the first. 

To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have 
experienced, in this late great change of the army, and 
the expenses incidental to it, to say nothing of the haz- 
ard we have run, and must run, between the discharging 
of one army and enUstment of another, unless an enor- 
mous expense of militia is incurred, would greatly ex- 
ceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already 
taken the liberty of saying will serve to convey a gene ■ 
ral idea of the matter ; and therefore I shall, with all 
due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opin- 



Pari- 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 281 

ion, that, il' the Congress have any reason to believe, 
that there will be occasion for troops another year, and 
consequently for another enlistment, they would save 
money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, 
even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to 
engage the men already enUsted till January next, and 
such others as may be wanted to complete the establish- 
ment, for and during the war. I will not undertake to 
say, that the men can be had upon these t»erms ; but I 
am satisfied, that it will never do to let the matter alone, 
as it was last year, till the time of service was near ex- 
piring. The hazard is too great, in the first place ; in 
the next, the trouble and perplexity of disbanding one 
army and raising another at the same instant, and in 
such a critical situation as the last was, are scarcely in 
the power of words to describe, and such as no man, 
who has experienced them once, will ever undergo 
again. 

If Congress should differ from me in sentiment upon 
this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the 
justice to believe, that I have nothing more in view, than 
what to me appears necessary to advance the public 
weal, although in the first instance it will be attended 
with a capital expense ; and that I have the honor 
to be, &c.

suits of bedding, bound from Lahave, in Nova Scotia, for 
Boston. She is one of the transports in the ministerial 
service. The captain says, that he was at Halifax the 
17th of January, and that General Massey had arrived 
there with two regiments from Ireland. 

The different prizes were all libelled immediately on 
the receipt of the resolves of Congress pointing out the 
mode ; but none of them are yet brought to trial, owing 
to a difference between the law passed in this province, 
and the resolutions of Congress. The General Court 
are making an amendment to their law, by which the 
difficulties that now occur will be removed, as I under- 
stand it is to be made conformable to your resolves. 
The unavoidable delay attending the bringing the cap- 
tures to trial is grievously complained of by the masters 
of these vessels, as well as the captors. Many of the 
former have applied for liberty to go away without wait- 
ing the decision, which I have granted them. 

I beg leave to recall the attention of Congress to their 
appointing a commissary in these parts, to attend to the 
providing of necessaries for the prisoners, who are dis- 
persed in these provinces. Complaints are made by 
some of them, that they are in want of bedding and 
many other things. As I understand that Mr. Franks 
has undertaken that business, I wish he was ordered to 
send a deputy immediately to see, that the prisoners get 
what is allowed them by Congress ; also to supply the 
officers with money, as they may have occasion. It 
would save me much time and much trouble. There 
are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This 
delay will, I am much afraid, frustrate the intention of 
their being called upon, as the season is slipping fast

away when they may be of ser\'ice. Tlie demands of 
the army were so very pressing before your last remit- 
tance came to hand, that I was under the necessity of 
borrowing twenty-five thousand pounds lawful money 
from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, and 
passed a vote for as much more, if required. I have 
not repaid the sum borrowed, as I may stand in need 
of it before the arrival of another supply, which the 
demands of the commissary-general, quartermaster- 
general, and paying off the arrearages, will very soon 
require. 

Your esteemed favor of the 29th ultimo is just come 
to hand. It makes me very happy to find my conduct 
has met the approbation of Congress. I am entirely 
of your opinion, that, should an accommodation take 
place, the terms will be severe or favorable in propor- 
tion to our ability to resist, and that we ought to be on 
a respectable footing to receive their armaments in the 
spring. But how far we shall be provided with the 
means, is a matter I profess not to know, under my 
present unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and, I may 
add, men, as our regiments are very incomplete. The 
recruiting goes on very slowly, and will, I apprehend, still 
decline, if for other service the men receive a bounty, 
and none is given here. I have tried every method I 
could think of, to procure arms for our men. They 
really are not to be had in these governments, belong- 
ing to the pubhc ; and if some method is not fallen upon, 
in the southern governments, to supply us, we shall be 
in a distressed situation for want of them. There are 
near two thousand men now in camp without firelocks. 
I have written to the committee of New York this day, 
requesting them to send me the arms, which were 
taken from the disaffected in that government. The 
Congress interesting themselves in this request will

doubtless have a good effect. I have sent officers into 
the country, with money to purchase arms in the differ- 
ent towns. Some have returned, and brought in a 
few ; many are still out ; what their success will be, I 
cannot determine. I was in great hopes that the ex- 
presses, resolved to be established between this place 
and Philadelphia, would ere now have been fixed. It 
would, in my opinion, rather save than increase the ex- 
pense, as many horses are destroyed by one man 
coming the whole way. It will certainly be more ex- 
peditious, and safer, than writing by the post or private 
hands, which I am often under the necessity of doing.

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 10 February, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 
If you conceive, that I took any thing wrong, or 
amiss, that was conveyed in any of your former letters, 
you are really mistaken. I only meant to convince you, 
that nothing would give me more real satisfaction, than 
to know the sentiments, which are entertained of me 
by the public, whether they be favorable or otherwise ; 
and I urged as a reason, that the man, who wished to 
steer clear of shelves and rocks, must know where 
they lie. I know the integrity of my own heart, but 
to declare it, unless to a friend, may be an argument of 
vanity ; I know the unhappy predicament I stand in ; I 
know that much is expected of me ; I know, that with- 
out men, without arms, without ammunition, without any 
thing fit for the accommodation of a soldier, htUe is to 
be done ; and, what is mortifying, I know, that I cannot 
stand justified to the world without exposing my own 



PartH.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 285 

weakness, and injuring the cause, by declaring my 
wants, which I am determined not to do, further than 
unavoidable necessity brings every man acquainted 
Avith them. 

If, under these disadvantages, I am able to keep 
above water, in the esteem of mankind, I shall feel 
myself happy ; but if, from the unknown peculiarity of 
my circumstances, I suffer in the opinion of the world, 
I shall not think you take the freedom of a friend, if 
you conceal the reflections that may be cast upon my 
conduct. My own situation is so irksome to me at 
times, that, if I did not consult the public good, more 
than my own tranquillity, I should long ere this have 
put every thing on the cast of a die. So far from my 
having an army of twenty thousand men well armed, I 
have been here with less than one half of that number, 
including sick, furloughed, and on command, and those 
neither armed nor clothed, as they should be. In short, 
my situation has been such, that I have been obliged to 
use art to conceal it from my own officers. 

The party sent to Bunker's Hill had some good and 
some bad men engaged in it. One or two courts have 
been held on the conduct of part of them. To be 
plain, these people are not to be depended upon if ex- 
posed ; and any man will fight well if he thinks him- 
self in no danger. I do not apply this only to these 
people. I suppose it to be the case with all raw and 
undisciplined troops. You may rely upon it, that trans- 
ports left Boston six weeks ago with troops ; where 
they are gone, unless driven to the West Indies, I know 
not. You may also rely upon General Clinton's sail- 
ing from Boston about three weeks ago, with about four 
or five hundred men ; his destination I am also a stran- 
ger to. I am sorry to hear of the failures you speak 
of from France. But why will not Congress forward 



286 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 43. 

part of the powder made in your province ? They 
seem to look upon this as the season for action, but will 
not furnish the means. I will not blame them. I dare 
say the demands upon them are greater than they can 
supply. The cause must be starved till our resources 
are greater, or more certain within ourselves. 

With respect to myself, I have never entertained 
an idea of an accommodation, since I heard of the 
measures, which were adopted in consequence of the 
Bunker's Hill fight. The King's speech has confirmed 
the sentiments I entertained upon the news of that 
affair ; and, if every man was of my mind, the ministers 
of Great Britain should know, in a few words, upon 
what issue the cause should be put. I would not be 
deceived by artful declarations, nor specious pretences ; 
nor would I be amused by unmeaning propositions ; but 
in open, undisguised, and manly terms proclaim our 
wrongs, and our resolution to be redressed. I would 
tell them, that we had borne much, that we had long 
and ardently sought for reconciliation upon honorable 
terms, that it had been denied us, that all our attempts 
after peace had proved abortive, and had been grossly 
misrepresented, that we had done every thing which 
could be expected from the best of subjects, that the 
spirit of freedom rises too high in us to submit to sla- 
very, and that, if nothing else would satisfy a tyrant and 
his diabolical ministry, we are determined to shake off 
all connexions with a state so unjust and unnatural. 
This I w^ould tell them, not under covert, but in words 
as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness. 

I observe what you say, in respect to the ardor of 
the chimney-corner heroes. I am glad their zeal is in 
some measure abated, because if circimistances will not 
permit us to make an attempt upon Boston, or if it 
should be made and fail, we shall not appear altogether 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 287 

SO culpable. I entertain the sanae opinion of the at- 
tempt now, which I have ever done. I believe an as- 
sault would be attended with considerable loss, and I 
believe it would succeed, if the men should behave well. 
As to an attack upon Bunker's Hill, unless it could be 
carried by surprise, the loss, I conceive, would be greater 
in proportion than at Boston ; and, if a defeat should 
follow, it would be discouraging to the men, but highly 
animating if crowned with success. Great good, or 
great evil, would consequently result from it. 

The Congress have ordered all captures to be tried 
in the courts of admiralty of the different governments 
to which they are sent. Some irreconcilable dillerence 
arising between the resolves of Congress, and the law 
of this colony, respecting the proceedings, or something 
which always happens to procrastinate business here, 
has put a total stop to the trials, to the no small injury 
of the public, as well as the great grievance of individuals. 
Whenever a condemnation shall take place, I shall not 
be unmindful of your advice respecting the hulls. 
Would to heaven the plan you speak of for obtaining 
arms may succeed. The acquisition would be great, 
and give fresh life and vigor to our measures. Our ex- 
pectations are kept alive, and if we can keep ourselves 
so, and our spirits up another summer, I have no fears 
of wanting the needful after that. 

We have had a most laborious piece of work at 
Lechmere's Point, on account of the frost. We hope 
to get it finished on Sunday. It is within as command- 
ing a distance of Boston as Dorchester Hill, though of 
a different part. Our vessels now and then pick up a 
prize or two. Our Commodore Manly was very near 
being caught about eight days ago, but happily escaped 
with his vessel and crew after running the former on 
shore, scuttling, and defending her. 



288 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 43. 

I recollect nothing else worth giving you the trouble 
of, unless you can be amused by reading a letter and 
poem addressed to me by Miss Phillis Wheatley. In 
searching over a parcel of papers the other day, in order 
to destroy such as were useless, I brought it to light 
again. At first, with a view of doing justice to her 
poetical genius, I had a great mind to publish the poem ; 
but not knowing whether it might not be considered 
rather as a mark of my own vanity, than as a compli- 
ment to her, I laid it aside, till I came across it again in 
the manner just mentioned. I congratulate you upon 
your election, although I consider it as the coup de grace 
to my expectation of ever seeing you a resident with 
me this campaign. I have only to regret the want of 
you, if that should be the case ; and I shall do it the 
more feelingly, as I have experienced the good effects 
of your aid. I am, with Mrs. Washington's compliments 
to Mrs. Reed, and my best respects, dear Sir, your 
most obedient and affectionate servant.

JS^, jL '/^^> Sir, S ^f-Ji fr^AA.^ . . . 

Through you, I beg leave to lay before Congress the en- 
closed letter from Lord Drummond to General Robert- 
son, which came to my hands a few days ago, in order 
to be sent into Boston. 

As I never heard of his Lordship's being vested with 
power to treat with Congress upon the subject of our 
grievances, nor of his having laid any propositions before 
them for an accommodation, I confess it surprised me 
much, and led me to form various conjectures of his 
motives, and intended application to General Howe and 



Part II.] THE AMHRICAN UKVOLUTION. 289 

Admiral Shuldham lor a passport for the safe conduct 
of such deputies, as Congress might appoint for nego- 
tiating terms of reconciliation between Great Britain and 
us. Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent 
his designs may be, I confess that his letter has em- 
barrassed me much ; and I am not without suspicion of 
its meaning more than the generous purposes it pro- 
fesses. 

I should suppose, that, if the mode for negotiation, 
which he points out, should be adopted (which I hope 
will never be thought of), it ought to have been fixed 
and setded previous to any application of this sort ; and 
at best, that his conduct in this instance is prematm^e 
and officious, and leading to consequences of a fatal and 
injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal 
and desire, perhaps, of an amicable and constitutional 
adjustment taking place, may have suggested and pre- 
cipitated the measure. Be that as it may, I thought it 
of too much importance to suffer it to go in without 
having the express direction of Congress for that pur- 
pose ; and that it was my indispensable duty to transmit 
to them the original, to make such interpretations and 
inferences as they may think right.* 

Messrs. Willard and Child, who were sent to Nova 
Scotia in pursuance of the resolve of Congress, have 
just returned, and made their report, which I do myself 
the honor to enclose. They have not answered the 
purposes of their commission by any means, as they only 
went a litUe way into that country, and found their in- 
telligence upon the information of others. You will see 
the reasons they assign in excuse or justification of their 
conduct, in the report itself. Last night a party of 
regulars, said to be about five hundred, landed on Dor-

The late freezing weather having formed some pretty 
strong ice from Dorchester Point to Boston Neck, and 
from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a 
more expanded and consequently a less dangerous ap- 
proach to the town, I could not help thinking, notwith- 
standing the militia were not all come in, and we had 
little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular 
cannonade or bombardment, that a bold and resolute 
assault upon the troops in Boston, with such men as we 
had (for it could not take many men to guard our own 
lines, at a time when the enemy were attacked in all 
quarters), might be crowned with success. Therefore, 
seeing no certain prospect of a supply of powder on 
the one hand, and a certain dissolution of the ice on the 
other, I called the general officers together for their

mouth, that, it being understood the enemy intended to take possession of 
Dorchester Point, or Neck, a detaclmient was ordered from Castle Wil- 
liam under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie, and another of 
grenadiers and light infantry commanded by Major Musgrave, with di- 
rections to pass over the ice and destroy every house and every kind of 
cover on tliat peninsula, which was executed, and six of the enemy's

opinion, agreeably to the resolve of Congress, of the 
22d of December.* 

The result will appear in the enclosed council of 
war ; and, being almost unanimous, I must suppose it to 
be right ; although, from a thorough conviction of the 
necessity of attempting something against the ministeri- 
al troops before a reinforcement should arrive, and while 
we were favored with the ice, I was not only ready, but 
willing, and desirous of making the assault, under a firm 
hope, if the men would have stood by me, of a favora- 
ble issue, notwithstanding the enemy's advantage of 
ground and artillery. Perhaps the irksomeness of my 
situation may have given different ideas to me, from 
those which influenced the gentlemen whom I consulted, 
and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard, 
than was consistent with prudence. If it did, I am not 
sensible of it, as I endeavoured to give it all the considera- 
tion, that a matter of such importance required. True 
it is, and I cannot help acknowledging it, that I have 
many disagreeable sensations on account of my situa- 
tion ; for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed 
with anxious expectation of hearing of some great event, 
and to be restrained in every military operation, for 
want of the necessary means of carrying it on, is not 
very pleasing, especially as the means, used to conceal 
my weakness from the enemy, conceal it also from our 
friends, and add to their wonder. 

I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am sensi- 
ble that all that the Congress could do, they have done ; 
and I should feel most powerfully the weight of conscious 
ingratitude, were I not to acknowledge this. But as 

* Congress had resolved, that, if General Washington and his council 
should be of the opinion, that a successful attack could be made on the 
troops in Boston, he should make it, notwithstanding the town and property 
in it might thereby be destroyed.

Mason, I would beg to have it sent on in the most ex- 
peditious manner; otherwise we shall not only lose all 
chance of the benefits resulting from the season, but of 
the militia, who are brought in at a most enormous ex- 
pense, upon a presumption that we should, long ere this, 
have been amply supplied with powder, under the con-

* On tlie 16th of February a council was held, in which the Comman- 
der-in-chief advanced what he deemed strong . reasons for making an 
immediate assault on the town of Boston, by proceeding from Cambridge 
and Roxbury over the ice, which was then frozen sufficiently hard. This 
opinion was overruled by the council on the grounds, that there was not 
force enough for .such an attempt, that the army was deficient in arms and 
powder, and that the impression of the field-officers generally was un- 
favorable to such a measure. It was, however, resolved, that a cannonade 
and bombardment would be advisable as soon as there should be a proper 
supply of powder, and that in the mean time preparations ought to be 
made for taking possession of Dorchester Heights, and of Noddle's Island 
also, if it could be effected. 

f General Lee had written ; — " The governor, and the captain of a 
man-of-war, had threatened perdition to the town, if the cannon were re-

defence, which I request you will lose no time in put- 
ting into execution, as, from many corroborating accounts 
I have received, the enemy seem to prepare for their 
departure from Boston. They have removed the two 
mortars from Bunker's Hill, and carried them with a 
great part of their heavy brass cannon on board their 
ships. They have taken all the topsail vessels in the 
harbour into the service. They are ready watered, and 
their sails bent. All this show may be only a feint ; but 
if real, and they should come your way, I wish you may 
be prepared to receive them. If I find that they are in 
earnest, and do go off, I will immediately send you a 
reinforcement from this camp, and, if necessary, march 
the main body to your assistance, as circumstances may 
require. I shall keep a good watch on their motions, 
and give you the speediest information possible. 

Lechmere's Point is now very strong ; I am sending 
some heavy cannon thither. The platform for a mortar 
is preparing to be placed in the works there ; another 
at Lamb's Dam ; and we are making the necessary 
disposition to possess ourselves of Dorchester Heights, 
which must bring them on if any thing will. If they 
do not interrupt us in that work, I shall be confirmed in 
my opinion, that they mean to leave the town. A little 
time must now determine, whether they are resolved to 

as a bndum fulmen, and even persuaded the town to be of the same way 
of thinking. We accordingly conveyed them to a place of safety in the 
middle of the day, and no cannonade ensued. Captain Parker publishes 
a pleasant reason for his passive conduct. He says that it was manifestly 
my intention, and that of the New England men under my command, to 
bring destruction on this town, so hated for its loyal principles, but that he 
was determined not to indulge us ; so remained quiet out of spite. The 
people here laugh at his nonsense, and begin to despise the menaces, 
which formerly used to throw thom into convulsions. To do them justice, 
the whole show a wonderful alacrity ; and, in removing the cannon, men 
and boys of all ages worked with the greatest zeal and pleasure. I really 
believe that the generality are as well affected as any on the continent."

The account you give of our New York brethren is 
very satisfactory. I should be glad to know how many

would happen, that the Congress would make you that 
proposal. I am now of opinion, that you will have 
work enough upon your hands where you are ; and 
make no doubt but your presence will be as necessary 
there, as it would be in Canada.* I am glad that 
Colonel Ritzema is gone to Congress, and I hope they 
will expedite an army thither, not only to preserve what 
we have already got, but also to possess ourselves of 
Quebec before it can be reinforced from Europe or else- 
where. It is an object of such vast importance, that it 
will be madness not to strain every sinew for effecting 
that purpose. I am in some pain for our little fleet, as

Gentlemen, 
As I am making all possible preparation to take pos- 
session of the Heights of Dorchester, which I expect I 
shall be able to accomplish by the latter end of this 
week, it is beheved that this, if any thing can, will 
bring the enemy out of Boston to oppose, as at Charles- 
town, our erecting any works there. To weaken our 
lines on the north side of Cambridge River, to strength- 
en those of Dorchester before any movement is made 
that way by the enemy, may neither be consistent with 
prudence nor good policy ; and to delay it till after an at- 
tack is begun, would be too late, as the contest will soon 
be decided for or against us, after this happens. In 
this state of the matter, and to avoid putting an affair of 
so much importance to a doubtful issue, when under 
Providence it may be reduced to a certainty, I submit it 
to the wisdom of your Board, whether it may not be 
best to direct the militia of certain towns, most contig- '

our conduct ; there can therefore be no greater inducement to men to be-

About ten days ago the severe freezing weather 
formed some pretty strong ice from Dorchester to Bos- 
ton Neck, and from Roxbury to the Common. This I 
thought, knowing the ice could not last, a favorable 
opportunity to make an assault upon the troops in town. 
I proposed it in council ; but behold, though we had 
been waiting all the year for this favorable event, the 
enterprise was thought too dangerous. Perhaps it was ; 
perhaps the irksomeness of my situation led me to un- 
dertake more than could be warranted by prudence. I 
did not think so, and I am sure yet, that the enterprise, 
if it had been undertaken with resolution, must have 
succeeded ; without it, any would fail ; but it is now at 
an end, and I am preparing to take post on Dorchester 
Heights, to try if the enemy will be so kind as to come 
out to us. Ten regiments of militia, you must know, 
had come in to strengthen my hands for offensive mea- 
sures ; but what I have said respecting the determi- 
nations in council, and the possessing of Dorchester 
Point, is spoken under the rose. I am, &,c.

Miss Phillis, 
Your favor of the 26th of October did not reach my 
hands, till the middle of December. Time enough, 

* Phillis Wheatley was born in Africa, and brought to Boston in a slave- 
ship, in the year 1761, then between seven and eight years of age. She 
was purchased by Mr. Wheatley, but she soon discovered qualities so in- 
teresting and peculiar, that slie was treated more as an inmate of the fam- 
ily, than as a slave. She made an extraordinary progress in acquiring the 
English language, and, witliout any advantage from schools, learned read- 
ing and writing, and manifested the greatest eagerness for gleaning 
knowledge. Her taste inclined to poetry ; she read and relished the best

you will say, to have given an answer ere this. Grant- 
ed. But a variety of important occurrences, continually 
interposing to distract the mind and withdraw the at- 
tention, I hope will apologize for the delay, and plead 
my excuse for the seeming but not real neglect. I 
thank you most sincerely for your polite notice of me, 
in the elegant lines you enclosed ; and however unde- 
serving I may be of such encomium and panegyric, the 
style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your poeti- 
cal talents ; in honor of which, and as a tribute justly 
due to you, I would have published the poem, had I 
not been apprehensive, that, while I only meant to give 
the world this new instance of your genius, I might 
have incurred the imputation of vanity. This, and 
nothing else, determined me not to give it place in the 
public prints. 

If you should ever come to Cambridge, or near 
head-quarters, I shall be happy to see a person so fa- 
vored by the Muses, and to whom nature has been so 
liberal and beneficent in her dispensations. I am, with 
great respect, yoiu* obedient humble servant. 



authors, and soon began to compose verses. Meantime the attention of 
the community was turned to so singular a phenomenon, and she was 
visited and noticed by people of the first character. Her correspondence 
was sought, and it extended to persons of distinction even in England, 
among whom may be named the Countess of Huntingdon, Whitefield, and 
the Earl of Dartmouth. In 1773, when she was nineteen years of age, a 
volume of her poems was published in London, some of which had been 
written five or si.x years. This volume is dedicated to the Countess of 
Huntingdon, and in the preface are the names of tlie Governor of Massa- 
chusetts, and several other eminent gentlemen, bearing testimony to their 
belief of her having been the genuine writer of the poems. In whatever 
order of merit they may be ranked, it cannot be doubted, that they exliibit 
the most favorable evidence on record, of the capacity of the African in- 
tellect for improvement. The classical allusions are numerous, and imply 
a wide compass of reading, a correct judgment, good taste, and a tenacious 
memory. Her deportment is represented to have been gentle and unpre- 
tending, her temper amiable, her feelings refined, and her religious im-

to joseph reed. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favors of the 28tli of January, and 1 st and 8th of 
February, are come to hand. For the agreeable accounts, 
contained in one of them, of your progress in the manu- 
facture of powder, and prospect of getting arms, I am 
obliged to you; as there is some consolation in knowing, 
that these useful articles will supply the wants of some 
part of the Continental troops, although I feel too sensi- 
bly the mortificadon of having them withheld from me ; 
Congress not even thinking it necessary to take the 
least notice of my application for these things. 

I hope in a few nights to be in readiness to take post 
on Dorchester Point, as we are using every means in 
our power to provide materials for this purpose ; the 
ground being so hard frozen yet, that we cannot in- 
trench, and therefore are obliged to depend endrely 
upon chandeliers, fascines, and screwed hay for our re- 
doubts. It is expected that this work will bring on an 
action between the King's troops and ours. 

General Lee's expedition to New York was founded 
upon indubitable evidence of General Clinton's being on 



pressions strong and constant. She was married, at wliat time is uncer- 
tain, to JVTr. John Peters, a man of her own color, whom tradition reports to 
hare been little qualified for conferring liappiness on so gifted a com- 
panion. She died at Boston, December 5th, 1784, aged thirty-one years. 

_ I have not been able to find, among Washington's papers, the letter and i. i /r J^f_,i_cL _

the point of sailing. No place was so likely for his des- 
tination as New York, and no place where a more capi- 
tal blow could be given to the interests of America. 
Common prudence, therefore, dictated the necessity of 
preventing an evil, which might have proved irremedi- 
able, had it happened. But I confess to you honestly, 
I had no idea of running the Continent to the expense, 
which was incurred, or that such a body of troops would 
go from Connecticut as did, or be raised upon the terms 
they were. You must know, my good Sir, that Captain 
Sears was here, with some other gentlemen of Connec- 
ticut, when the intelligence of Clinton's embarkation (at 
least the embarkation of the troops) came to hand. 
The situation of these lines would not afford a detach- 
ment. New York could not be depended upon ; and 
of the troops in Jersey we had no certain information, 
either as to their numbers or destination. What then 
was to be done 7 Why Sears and these other gentle- 
men assured me, that if the necessity of the case was 
signified by me, and General Lee should be sent, one 
thousand volunteers, requiring no pay, but supplied with 
provisions only, would march immediately to New York, 
and defend the place, till Congress could determine 
what should be done, and that a line from me to Gover- 
nor Trumbull to obtain his sanction would facilitate the 
measure. This I accordingly wrote in precise terms, 
intending that these volunteers, and such of the Jersey 
regiments as could be speedily assembled, should be 
thrown into the city for its defence, and for disarming 
the Tories upon Long Island, who, I understood, had 
become extremely insolent and daring. When, behold, 
instead of volunteers, consisting of gendemen without 
pay, the Governor directed men to be voluntarily en- 
listed for this service upon Continental pay and allow- 
ance. This, you will observe, was contrary to my ex- 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 301 

pectation and plan ; yet, as I thought it a matter of the 
last importance to secure the communication of the 
North River, I did not deem it expedient to counter- 
mand the raising of the Connecticut regiments on ac- 
count of the pay. If I have done wrong, those members 
of Congress, who think the matter ought to have been 
left to them, must consider my proceedings as an error 
of judgment, and that a measure is not always to be 
judged by the event. 

It is moreover worthy of consideration, that in cases 
of extreme necessity like the present, nothing but de- 
cision can ensure success ; and certain I am, that Clin- 
ton had something more in view by peeping into New 
York, than to gratify his curiosity, or make a friendly 
visit to his friend Mr. Tryon. However, I am not fond 
of stretching my powers ; and if the Congress will say, 
" Thus far and no farther you shall go," I will promise 
not to offend whilst I continue in their service. 

I observe what you say in respect to my wagon. I 
wanted nothing more, than a light travelling-wagon, 
such as those of New Jersey, with a secure cover, 
which might be under lock and key, the hinges being 
on one side, the lock on the other. I have no copy of 
the memorandum of the articles, which I desired you to 
provide for me, but think one dozen and a half of camp 
stools, a folding table, plates, and dishes, were among 
them. What I meant, therefore, was, that the bed of 
the wagon should be constructed in such a manner, as 
to stow these things to the best advantage. If you can- 
not get them with you, I shall despair of providing them 
here, as workmen are scarce, and most exorbitantly 
high in their charges. What I should aim at is, when 
the wagon and things are ready (which ought to be 
very soon, as I do not know how soon we may beat a 
march), to buy a pair of clever horses, of the same color,

hire a careful driver, and let the whole come ofi' at once; 
and then they wOl be ready for immediate service. I 
have no doubt that the treasury, by application to Mr. 
Hancock, will direct payment thereof, without an}' kind 
of difficulty, as Congress must be sensible, that I cannot 
take the field without equipage, and after I have once 
got into a tent I shall not soon quit it. I am, &,c.

/o 2 . /• . »' •'y MR, 

' On the 26th ultimo I had the honor of addressing 

you, and then mentioned that we were making prepara- 
tions for taking possession of Dorchester Heights. I 
now beg leave to inform you, that a council of general 
officers having determined a previous bombardment and 
cannonade expedient and proper, in order to harass the 
enemy and divert their attention from that quarter, on 
^ ^^^ <• *f - Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights last, we carried 

them on from our posts at Cobble Hill, Lechmere's 
Point, and Lamb's Dam.* Whether they did the en- 
emy any considerable and what injury, I have not yet 
heard, but have the pleasure to acquaint you, that they 
greatly facilitated our schemes, and would have been 
attended with success equal to our most sanguine ex- 
pectations, had it not been for the unlucky bursting of 
two thirteen and three ten inch mortars, among which 
was the brass one taken in the ordnance brig. To 
what cause to attribute this misfortune, I know not ; 
whether to any defect in them, or to the inexperience 
of the bombardiers. 

* The position of a battery in Roxbury. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 303 

But to return ; on Monday evening, as soon as our 
firing commenced, a considerable detachment of our ^X o o w^i 
men, under the command of Brigadier-General Thomas, 
crossed the neck, and took possession of the two hills, 
without the least interruption or annoyance from the 
enemy ; and by their great activity and industry, before 
the morning, advanced the works so far as to be secure 
against their shot. They are now going on with such 
expedition, that in a Httle time I hope they will be com- 
plete, and enable our troops stationed there to make a 
vigorous and obstinate stand. During the whole can- 
nonade, which was incessant the two last nights, we 
were fortunate enough to lose but two men ; one, a lieu- 
tenant, by a cannon-ball taking off his thigh ; the other, 
a private, by the explosion of a shell, which also slightly 
wounded four or five more. 

Our taking possession of Dorchester Heights is only 
preparatory to taking post on Nook's Hill, and the 
points opposite to the south end of Boston. It was ab- 
solutely necessary, that they should be previously forti- 
fied, in order to cover and command them. As soon as 
the works on the former are finished, measures W'ill be 
immediately adopted for securing the latter, and making 
them as strong and defensible as we can. Their con- 
tiguity to the enemy will make them of much impor- 
tance and of great service to us. As mortars are 
essential, and indispensably necessary for carrying on 
our operations, and for the prosecution of our plans, I 
have applied to two furnaces to have some thirteen-inch 
ones cast with all expedition imaginable, and am en- 
couraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that 
they will be able to do it. When they are done, and a 
proper supply of powder obtained, I flatter myself, from 
the posts w^e have just taken and are about to take, that 
it will be in our power to force the ministerial troops to

an attack, or to dispo.se of them in some way, that will 
be of advantage to us. I think from these posts they 
will be so galled and annoyed, that they must either 
give us battle or quit their present possessions. I am 
resolved that nothing on my part shall be wanting to 
effect the one or the other. 

It having been the general opinion, that the enemy 
would attempt to dislodge our people from the Heights, 
and force their works as soon as they were discovered, 
which probably might have brought on a general en- 
gagement, it was thought advisable, that the honorable 
Council * should be applied to, to order in the militia 
from the neighbouring and adjacent towns. I wrote to 
them on the subject, which they most readily compUed 
with ; and, in justice to the militia, I cannot but inform 
you, that they came in at the appointed time, and mani- 
fested the greatest alertness, and determined resolution 
to act like men engaged in the cause of freedom. 

When the enemy first discovered our works in the 
,_dol morning, they seemed to be in great confusion, and, 

A, kj~ from their movements, to intend an attack. It is 
^7vxi/uk/v, much to be Avished, that it had been made. The 
i>^ >^ [k^ U^ . event, I think, must have been fortunate, and nothing 
^i > "^ I ' less than success and victory on our side, as our officers 
and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to 
possess the most animated sentiments and determined 
resolution. On Tuesday evening a considerable num- 
ber of their troops embarked on board of their trans- 
' *^ ^"^ • ^^" ports, and fell down to the Castle, where part of them 
. . ^'X landed before dark. One or two of the vessels got 

aground, and were fired at by our people with a field- 
piece, but without any damage. What was the design 
of this embarkation and landing, I have not been able to

learn. It would seem as if they meant an attack ; for it 
is most probable, that, if they make one on our works at 
Dorchester at this time, they will first go to the Castle, 
and come from thence. If such was their design, a vio- 
lent storm that night, which lasted till eight o'clock 
the next day, rendered the execution of it impracticable, (y^^ /j^ (f tti itV^^

have since got off. '^ - ,^ ^ • .-.•^■'■- • '<-''^ ^ 

In case the ministerial troops had made an attempt to 
dislodge our men from Dorchester Heights, and the 
number detached upon the occasion had been so great 
as to have afforded a probabiUty of a successful attack 
being made upon Boston ; on a signal given from Rox- 
bury for that purpose, agreeably to a settled and con- 
certed plan, four thousand chosen men, who were held 
in readiness, were to have embarked at the mouth of 
Cambridge River, in two divisions, the first under the 
command of Brigadier-General Sullivan, the second 
under Brigadier-General Greene ; the whole to have 
been commanded by Major-General Putnam. The first 
division was to land at the powder-house, and gain pos- 
session of Beacon Hill and Mount Horam ; the second 
at Barton's Point, or a little south of it, and, after secur- 
ing that post, to join the other division, and force the 
enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the 
Roxbury troops. Three floating batteries were to have 
preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept 
up a heavy fire on that part of the town where our men 
were to land. 

How far our views would have succeeded, had an 
opportunity offered for attempting the execution, it is 
impossible for me to say. Nothing less than experiment 
could determine with precision. The plan was thought 
to be well digested ; and, as far as I could judge from 
the cheerfulness and alacrity, which distinguished the

306 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

officers and men, who were to engage in the enterprise, 
I had reason to hope for a favorable and happy issue.* 
The militia, who were ordered in from the adjacent 
towns, brought with them three days' provision. They 
were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack 
being immediately made, and were all discharged this 
afternoon. I beg leave to remind Congress, that three 
major-generals are essential and necessary for this army; 
and that, by General Lee's being called from hence to 
the command in Canada, the left division is without one. 
I hope they will fill" up the vacancy by the appointment 
of another. General Thomas is the first brigadier, stands 
fair in point of reputation, and is esteemed a brave and 
good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy 
in the brigadier-generals, which it will be necessary to 
supply by the appointment of some other gentleman 
that shall be agreeable to Congress ; but justice requires 
me to mention, that William Thompson, of the rifle regi- 
ment, is the first colonel in this department, and, as far 
as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good offi- 
cer and a man of courage. What I have said of these 
two gentlemen, I conceive to be my duty, at the same 
time acknowledging, whatever promotions are made will 
be sadsfactory to me.

Stances corroborating ; and it seems fully confirmed by 
a paper signed by four of the selectmen of the town (a 
copy of which I have the honor to enclose to you), which 
w-as brought out yesterday evening by a flag, and de- 
livered to Colonel Learned, by Major Bassett, of the 
tenth regiment, who desired it might be delivered to me 
as soon as possible. I advised with such of the general 
officers upon the occasion as I could immediately as- 
semble ; and we determined it right (as it was not ad- 
dressed to me, nor to any one else, nor authenticated 
by the signature of General Howe, or any other act 
obliging him to a performance of the promise mentioned 
on his part), that I should give it no answer; at the 
same time, that a letter should be returned, as going 
from Colonel Learned, signifying his having laid it be- 
fore me ; with the reasons assigned for not answering it. 
A copy of this is sent. * 

To-night I shall have a battery thrown up on Nook's 
Hill, Dorchester Point, with a design of acting as cir- 
cumstances may require ; it being judged advisable to 
prosecute our plans of fortification, as we intended be- 
fore this information from the selectmen came. It being 
agreed on all hands, that there is no possibility of stop- 
ping them in case they determine to go, I shall order 
look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to discover 
their movements and course, and moreover direct Com- 
modore Manly and his little squadron to dog them, as 
well for the same purpose, as for picking up any of their 
vessels, that may chance to depart from their convoy. 
From their loading with such precipitancy, it is presum- 
able they will not be in the best condition for sea. 

If the ministerial troops evacuate the town and leave 
it standing, I have thoughts of taking measures for forti-

fying the entrance into the harbour, if it shall be thought 
proper, and the situation of affairs Aviil admit of it. Not- 
withstanding the report from Boston, that Halifax is the 
place of their destination, I have no doubt but that they 
are going to the southward, and, I apprehend, to New 
York. Many reasons lead to this opinion. It is in 
some measure corroborated by their sending an express 
ship there, which, on Wednesday week, got on shore 
and bilged at Cape Cod. The despatches, if written, 
were destroyed when she Avas boarded. She had a 
parcel of coal, and about four thousand cannon-shot, six 
carriage-guns, a swivel or two, and three barrels of 
powder. 

I shall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops 
in readiness to march at a moment's warning, and gov- 
ern my movements by the events that happen, or such 
orders as I may receive from Congress, which I beg 
may be ample, and forwarded with all possible expedi- 
tion. I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 7 March, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 
Your favor of the 18th ultimo came to my hands by 
post last night, and gives me much pleasure, as I am led 
to hope I shall see you in my family again. The terms 
upon which you come will be perfectly agreeable to me, 
and I should think you neither candid nor friendly, if 
your communications on this subject had not been free, 
unreserved, and divested of that false modesty, which 
too often prevents the elucidation of points important to 
be known. Mr. Baylor seeming to have an inclination 



PaktII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 309 

to go into the ai-tillery, and Colonel Knox being desirous 
of it, I have appointed Mr. Moylan and Mr. Palfrey my 
aids-de-camp, so that I shall, if you come, have a good 
many writers about me. 

I think ray countrymen made a capital mistake, when 
they took Henry out of the senate to place him in the 
field ; and pity it is, that he does not see this, and re- 
move every difficulty by a voluntary resignation. I am 
of opinion, that Colonel Armstrong, if he retains his 
health, spirits, and vigor, would be as fit a person as any 
they could send to Virginia, as he is senior officer to 
any now there, and I should think could give no offence ; 
but to place Colonel Thompson there, in the first com- 
mand, would throw every thing into the utmost confu- 
sion ; for it was by mere chance that he became a colonel 
upon this expedition, and by greater chance that he be- 
came first colonel in this army. To take him then from 
another colony, place him over the heads of several gen- 
tlemen, under or with whom he has served in a subordi- 
nate character, would never answer any other purpose, 
than that of introducing endless confusion. Such a 
thing surely cannot be in contemplation ; and, knowing 
the mischiefs it would produce, surely Colonel Thomp- 
son would have more sense, and a greater regard for 
the cause he is engaged in, than to accept of it, unless 
some uncommon abilities or exertions had given him a 
superior claim. He must know, that nothing more than 
being a captain of horse in the year 1759 (I think it 
was) did very extraordinarily give him the stai-t he now 
has, when the rank was settled here. At the same 
time, he must know another fact, that several officers 
now in the Virginia service were much his superiors in 
point of rank, and will not I am sure serve under him. 
He stands first colonel here, and may, I presume, put 
in a very good and proper claim to the first brigade that 



310 VVASPIINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

Ms vacant ; but I hope more regard will be paid to the 
service, than to send him to Virginia. 

The bringing of Colonel Armstrong into this army as 
major-general, however great his merit, would introduce 
much confusion. Thomas, if no more, would surely 
quit, and I beheve him to be a good man. If Thomas 
supphes the place of Lee, there will be a vacancy for 
either Armstrong or Thompson; for I have heard of no 
other valiant son of New England waiting promotion, 
since the advancement of Frye, who has not, and I 
doubt will not, do much service to the cause. 

I am sorry to hear of your ill-fated fleet. We had it, 
I suppose because we wished it, that Hopkins had taken 
Clinton, and his transports. How glorious would this 
have been ! We have the proverb on our side, how- 
ever, that "a bad beginning will end well." This 
applies to land and sea service. The account given of 
the business of the commissioners from England seems 
to be of a piece with Lord North's conciliatory motion 
last year, built upon the same foundation, and, if true 
that they are to be divided among the colonies to olTer 
terms of pardon, it is as insulting as that motion ;* and 
only designed, after stopping all intercourse with us, to 
set us up to view in Great Britain, as a people that will 
not hearken to any propositions of peace. Was there 
ever any thing more absurd, than to repeal the very acts, 
which have introduced all this confusion and bloodshed, 
and at the same time enact a law to restrain all inter- 
course with the colonies for opposing them ? The drift 
and design are obvious ; but is it possible that any sen- 
sible nation upon earth can be imposed upon by such a 
cobweb scheme, or gauze covering ? But enough. 



* It was at first reported, that it was the design of the British govern- 
ment to send over a large number of commissioners to America, and that 
they were to make advances to the colonies separately. 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 311 

March 9iA.— Colonel Bull's still waiting to see a little 
further into the event of things gives me an opportunity 
of adding, that from a gentleman out of Boston, con- 
firmed by a paper from the selectmen there, we have 
undoubted information of General Howe's preparing 
with great precipitancy to embark his troops ; for what 
place we know not ; Halifax, it is said. The selectmen, 
being under dreadful apprehensions for the town, ap- 
plied to General Robertson to apply to General Howe, 
who through General Robertson has informed them, that 
it is not his intention to detroy the town, unless his Maj- 
esty's troops should be molested during their embarka- 
tion, or at their departure. This paper seems so much 
under covert, unauthenticated, and addressed to nobody, 
that I sent word to the selectmen, that I could take no 
notice of it ; but I shall go on with my preparations as 
intended. The genUemen above mentioned out of Bos- 
ton say, that they seem to be in great consternation 
there, that one of our shot from Lamb's Dam disabled 
six men in their beds, and that the Admiral upon dis- 
covering our works next morning informed the General 
that, unless we were dispossessed of them, he could not 
keep the King's ships in the harbour ; and that three 
thousand men, commanded by Lord Percy, were actu- 
ally embarked for that purpose. Of the issue of it you 
have been informed before. I am, &-c.

troops from Boston; and fully expected, before this, 
that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Al- 
though I have been deceived, and was rather premature 
in the opinion I had then formed, I have Utde reason to 
doubt but the event will take place in a very short time, 
as other accounts, which have come to hand since, of 
the sailing of a great number of transports from the har- 
bour to Nantasket Road, and many circumstances cor- 
responding therewith, seem to confirm and render it un- 
questionable. Whether the town Avill be destroyed, is 
a matter of much uncertainty ; but it w ould seem, from 
the destruction they are making of sundry pieces of fur- 
niture, of many of their wagons and carts, which they 
cannot take with them as it is said, that it will not ; for, 
if they intended it, the whole might be involved in one 
general ruin. 

Holding it of the last importance in the present con- 
test, that we should secure New York, and prevent the 
enemy from possessing it, and conjecturing they have 
views of that sort, and their embarkation to be for that 
purpose, I judged it necessary, under the situation of 
things here, to call a council of general officers to con- 
sult on such measures, as might be expedient to be 
K^' ^ Cr-t^M taken at this interesting conjuncture of affairs. A copy 
}Unr}C) (tux of the proceedings I have the honor to enclose to you. 
Agreeably to the opinion of the council, I shall detach 
the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of 
Brigadier-General Sullivan, with orders to repair to New 
York with all possible expedition ; which will be suc- 
ceeded the day after by the other five in one brigade, 
. they being all that it was thought advisable to send from 
hence, till the enemy shall have quitted the town. Im- 
mediately upon their departure, I shall send forward 
Major-General Putnam, and follow myself with the re- 
mainder of the army, as soon as I have it in my power. 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 313 

leaving here such a number of men, as circumstances 
may seem to require. 

As the badness of the roads at this season will great- 
ly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of 
the general officers, written to Governor Trumbull by 
this express, to use his utmost exertions for throwing a 
reinforcement of two thousand men into New York, 
from the western parts of Connecticut ; and to the 
commanding othcer there, to apply to the Provincial 
Convention or Committee of Safety of New Jersey, for 
a thousand more for the same purpose, to oppose the 
enemy and prevent their getting possession, in case they 
arrive before the troops from hence can get there ; of 
which there is a probability, unless they are impeded by 
contrary winds. This measure, though it may be at- 
tended with considerable expense, I Hatter myself will 
meet with the approbation of Congress. Past experi- 
ence, and the lines in Boston and on Boston Neck, 
point out the propriety, and suggest the necessity, of 
keeping our enemies from gaining possession and 
making a lodgment. Should their destination be further 
southward, or for Halifax, as reported in Boston, for the 
purpose of going into Canada, the march of our troops 
to New York will place them nearer the scene of action, 
and more convenient for affording succour. We have 
not taken post on Nook's Hill, and fortified it, as I men- 
tioned we should in my last. On hearing, that the ene- 
my were about to retreat and leave the town, it was 
thought imprudent and unadvisable to force them with 
too much precipitation, that we might gain a little time 
and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we shall 
take possession of it, unless they are gone. As New 
York is of such importance, prudence and policy re- 
quire that every precaution, that can be devised, should 
be adopted to frustrate the designs, which the enemy 

VOL. III. 40 AA 



314 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

have of possessing it. To this end I have ordered ves- 
sels to be provided, and held ready at Norwich, for the 
embarkation and transportation of our troops thither. 
This I have done with a view not only of greatly expe- 
diting their arrival, as it will save several days' march- 
ing, but also that they may be fresh and fit for intrench- 
ing and throwing up works of defence, as soon as they 
get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend 
with ; for neither of which would they be in a proper 
condition, after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. 
If Wallace, with his ships, should be apprized of the 
measure, and attempt to prevent it by stopping up the 
harbour of New London, they can but pursue their 
march by land. 

You will please to observe, that it is the opinion of the 
general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it 
will be unnecessary to employ or keep any part of this 
army for its defence ; and that I have mentioned, on 
that event happening, I shall immediately repair to New- 
York with the remainder of the army not now detach- 
ed, leaving only such a number of men here as circum- 
stances may seem to require. What I partly allude to is, 
that, — as it will take a considerable time for the removal 
of such a body of men, and the divisions must precede 
each other in such order as to allow intermediate time 
suflicient for them to be covered and provided for, and 
many things done previous to the march of the whole, 
for securing and forwarding such necessaries, as cannot 
be immediately carried, and others which it may be 
proper to keep here, — directions might be received from 
Congress respecting the same, and as many men order- 
ed to remain for that and other purposes, as they may 
judge proper. I could wish to have their commands 
upon the subject, and in time, as I may be under some 
degree of embarrassment as to their views. Congress

having been pleased to appoint Colonel Thompson a 
brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the 
regiment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to 
recommend Lieutenant-Colonel Hand. I shall also take 
the liberty ol" recommending Captain Hugh Stephenson, 
of the Virginia riflemen, to succeed Colonel Hand, and 
to be appointed in his place as lieutenant-colonel, there 
being no major to the regiment, since the promotion of 
Major Magaw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the 
Pennsylvania battalions, who is gone from hence. He 
is, in my opinion, the fittest person in this army for 
it, as well as the oldest captain in the service, having 
distinguished himself at the head of a rifle company all 
the last war, and highly merited the approbation of his 
superior officers. I am, &,c. ffic^ , ^^'^ 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL LEE. 



Head-Q,uarters, Cambridge, 14 March, 1776. , 

Dear Sir, ■ ^U. \rc^^-^ -^ 



I am indebted to you for your three several favors, 
which I should have acknowledged sooner, had not the 
great hurry and bustle we have been in for several days 
past prevented. You have doubdess heard, before this 
time, of our being in possession of Dorchester Hill, 
which important business was executed in one night, q " *^ 
without any loss. The enemy were thrown into the 'L^^* 
utmost consternadon, when they perceived, the next 
morning, what had been effected the preceding night, 
and made preparations to dislodge us. Three thousand 
men under the command of Lord Percy were drafted /i- ^ ^'H^ 
for this service ; but a very heavy storm of wind and 
rain frustrated their design; in my opinion the most 
fortunate circumstance for them and unfortunate for us, 






316 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 44 

that could have happened, as we had every thmg so 
well prepared for their reception, that I am confident 
we should have given a very good account of them. 

\ I was just about to congratulate you on your appoint- 
ment to the command in Canada, when I received the 
account that your destination was altered. As a Vir- 
ginian, I must rejoice at the change ; but as an Ameri- 
can, I think you would have done more essential ser- 
vice to the common cause in Canada. For, besides 
the advantage of speaking and thinking in French, an 
officer who is acquainted with their manners and cus- 
toms, and has travelled in their country, must certain- 
ly take the strongest hold of their affection and confi- 

[^dence. 

You mention nothing of the guard, that went with 
you from hence. Mr. Palfrey tells me you intend to 
take them with you. As it will create great confusion 
in the regimental accounts, and they can be of no great 
service to you, I must beg you will let them remain at 
New York, where they will be soon joined by their 
respective regiments. I am much pleased with your 
plans for the defence and security of New York. 
What you may leave unfinished, I shall order the com- 
manding officer to complete, as soon as possible. Lest 
the enemy should meet with favorable winds in their 
passage, and get there before our army, I have written 
to Governor Trumbull, desiring him immediately to 
forward two thousand men, and have also requested one 
thousand from the Jerseys. This, with the force al- 
ready there, I hope will be able to keep the ministerial 
army at bay, until I can arrive with the main body. I 
most sincerely wish for your increase of health and 
every blessing, and am, dear Sir, your most affectionate 
friend and humble servant.

TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER AT NEW YORK. 

d .■^ ^,, ' Cambridge, 14 March, 1776. 

Sir, , ^^\^ 

I have stronger reasons, since I wrote to you last, to 
confirm me in my opinion, that the army under General 
Howe is on its departure. All their movements indicate 
it ; but lest it be a feint, I must continue on my guard, 
and not weaken my lines too much, until I have a cer- 
tainty of their departure. It is given out, that they are 
bound to Halifax ; but I am of opinion, that New York 
is their place of destination. It is an object worthy of 
their attention, and it is the place that we must use 
every endeavour to keep from them. For should they 
get that town, and the command of the North River, 
they can stop the intercourse between the northern and 
southern colonies, upon wliich depends the safety of 
America. 

My feelings upon this subject are so strong, that I 
would not wish to give the enemy a chance of succeed- 
ing at your place. I shall, therefore, despatch a regi- 
ment, and some independent companies of riflemen this 
day ; and to-morrow, or as soon as it conveniently can 
be done, five more regiments will set out from this 
camp. I cannot part with more while the enemy re- 
main in sight ; but I have written to Governor Trumbull 
to send you two thousand men, as soon as he possibly 
can. If you can get one thousand from New Jersey, 
with the militia of the country called in, if not repugnant 
to the will of Congress, I think you can make a suffi- 
cient stand, until I can with the main body of this army 
join you ; which you may depend will be as soon as 
possible, after I can with any degree of certainty tell 
their route. 

The plan of defence formed by General Lee, is, from 

AA» 



318 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

what little I know of the place, a very judicious one. 
I hope, nay, I dare say, it is carrying into execution 
with spirit and industry. You may judge from the 
enemy's keeping so long possession of the town of 
Boston against an army superior in numbers, and ani- 
mated with the noble spirit of liberty ; I say, you may 
judge by that, how much easier it is to keep an enemy 
from forming a lodgment in a place, than it will be to 
dispossess them, when they get themselves fortified. 
As I have in my last told you, that the fate of this cam- 
paign, of course the fate of America, depends upon you 
and the army under your command, should the enemy 
attempt your quarter, I will dwell no more thereon, 
though the vast importance of the subject would make 
an apology for repetition needless. I am, Sir, &c.* 



* Lord Stirling took tJie command at New York, on General Lee's de- 
parture for the southward, March 7th, and this letter was received by him. 
He replied on the 20th ; — 

" I am happy to find, that the aid I called in from New Jersey and 
Comiecticut exactly concurs with your sentiments. Tlie two regiments of 
Connecticut now here, consisting of about five hundred rank and file each, 
are impatient to go home, as many of them are farmers who want to make 
out their summer's work. The time of their engagement with General 
Lee ends next Monday. I have used my best endeavours to prevail on 
them to stay, till their places are supplied from that quarter, but it is still 
doubtful whether they will consent to it. Of this I have apprized Gover- 
nor Trumbull, and have requested him to make up the whole two thousand 
from that colony. From New Jersey I have requested one thousand men ; 
about two hundred of them are come in. About one thousand are ordered 
from the northern counties of this province. None of them is yet ar- 
rived. 

" We have now in this place and on Long Island about two thousand 
five hundred men, including the above two Connecticut regiments. The 
militia in town amount to about as many more. Near one half of the 
whole are on fatigue every day, carrying into execution the plan of de- 
fence formed by General Lee. They go on with great spirit and industry. 
The Congress have ordered eight thousand men for the defence of this 
city and province. The corps to make up this number are four regiments 
from Pennsylvania, one from New Jersey, and four from this province, none 
of which is yet arrived, and most of them are incomplete and unfit to

have marked their conduct, that our opposition and re- ft^'WUX* • H UtM^ 
sistance, in every quarter, may be crowned with the ^-^^ t^whf^f'\l 
success they have been here.* To what place is their ' 

destination, or what plans they have in view% is alto- 
gether unknown here. Most probably the next attempt 
will be against New York, or some more southern colo- 
ny. However, I should think, though I do not believe 
they have any design against Rhode Island, that it will 

march, especially those of this province, of whom not above two hundred 
are yet in town ; and some of them I find are to be employed on Hud- 
son's River, and in the northern parts of the province. 

" P. S. Brigadier-General Thompson is arrived here this day, and of 
course takes the command ; my utmost industry will be exerted to assist 
him in it." 

Besides the eight brigadiers first appointed. Congress had on tlie 10th of 
January added two others, Arnold and Frye. And on the 1st of March 
they elected six more, namely, John Armstrong, William Thompson, 
Andrew Lewis, James Moore, Lord Stiriing, and Robert Howe. Congress 
at the same time ordered Thompson to New York, and as he took rank of 
Stirling in the order of appointment, the command consequently devolved 
on him. He had been Colonel of tlie Pennsylvania battalion of riflemen. 
Edward Hand was chosen his successor. 

* The following account appeared in the Boston Gazette shortly after 
the evacuation. 

"About nine o'clock, on the 17th instant, a body of the enemy were 
seen to march from Bunker's HUl, and at the same tune a very great 
number of boats, filled with troops, put off from Boston, and made for the 
shipping, which mostly lay below the Castle. On the first discovery of

you, whether it may not be proper, against the time you 
apprehend they might arrive, to call in a number of the

not mean to direct the measure, but only to mention it 
for your consideration. To me it appears worthy of 
attention. I am, &c.

Sunday last, the 17th instant, about nine o'clock in the 
forenoon, the ministerial army evacuated the town of 
Boston, and that the forces of the United Colonies are 
now in actual possession thereof. I beg leave to con- 
gratulate you. Sir, and the honorable Congress, on this 
happy event, and particularly as it was effected without 
endangering the lives and property of the remaining 
unhappy inhabitants. 

these movements, the Continentals immediately paraded, several regiments 
embarked in boats, and proceeded down the river from Cambridge. About 
the same time two men were sent to Bunker's HUl to make discoveries. 
They proceeded accordingly ; and, when arrived, making a signal that 
the fort was evacuated, a detachment was immediately sent down from 
the army to take possession of it. The troops in the river, who were 
commanded by General Putnam, landed at Sewall's Point, where they re- 
ceived intelligence, that all tlie Britisli troops had left Boston, on which a 
detachment was sent to take possession of the town, while the main body 
returned up the river. About the same time General W^ard, attended by 
about five hundred troops from Roxbury, under the command of Colonel 
Learned, who unbarred and opened the gates, entered the town in that 
quarter. The command of the whole being then given to General Putnam, 
he proceeded to take possession of all the important posts." 

Gordon relates, tliat when the British retreated from Bunker's Hill, 
they left sentries standing in effigy, with their muskets shouldered, and 
having the usual appearance of being on duty.

I have great reason to imagine tiieir llight was precip- 
itated by tiie appearance of a work, wliich I had or- 
dered to be thrown up last Saturday night on an emi- 
nence at Dorchester, which Hes nearest to Boston Neck, 
called Nook's Hill. The town, although it has suffered 
greatly, is not in so bad a state as I expected to find it ; 
and I have a particular pleasure in being able to inform 
you. Sir, that your house has received no damage worth 
mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and 
the family pictures are all left entire and untouched. 
Captain Cazneau takes charge of the whole, until he 'Tia.^c , *i-Cc 
shall receive further orders from you. As soon as the 'Wuvh.a^ /L & 
ministerial troops had quitted the town, I ordered a 'Oui^cc 
thousand men (who had had the smallpox), under com- 
mand of General Putnam, to take possession of the 
heights, which I shall endeavour to fortify in such a 
manner, as to prevent their return, should they attempt 
it. But, as they are still in the harbour, I thought it not 
prudent to march off with the main body of the army, 
until I should be fully satisfied they had quitted the 
coast. I have, therefore, only detached five regiments, • 

besides the ritle battalion, to New York, and shall keep 
the remainder here till all suspicion of their return 
ceases. 

The situation in which I found their works evidently 
discovered, that their retreat was made with the great- 
est precipitation. They have left their barracks and 
other works of wood at Bunker's Hill all standing, and 
have destroyed but a small part of their lines. They 
have also left a number of fine pieces of cannon, which 
they first spiked up, also a very large iron mortar ; and, 
as I am informed, they have thrown another over the 
end of your wharf. I have employed proper persons to 
drill the cannon, and doubt not I shall save the most of 
them. I am not yet able to procure an exact list of all

the stores they have left. As soon as it can be done, I 
shall take care to transmit it to you. From an estimate 
of what the quartermaster-general has already discov- 
ered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thousand 
pounds. Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the 
6th instant has already arrived. The remainder I have 
ordered to be stopped on the road, as we shall have no 
occasion for it here. The letter to General Thomas, I

four days, to settle some of his private affairs; after 
which, he will set out for his command in Canada.* I

business in the town is to be molested in his person or 
property, on any pretence whatever. 

If any officer or soldier shall presume to strike, im- 
prison, or otherwise ill-treat any of the inhabitants, he 
may depend on being punished with the utmost sever-

from any of the inhabitants, he is to seek redress in a 
legal way, and no other. 

Any non-commissioned officer or soldier, or others 
under my command, who shall be guilty of robbing or 
plundering in the town, are to be immediately confined, 
and will be most rigidly punished. All officers are 
therefore ordered to be very vigilant in the discovery of 
such offenders, and report their names and crime to the 
commanding officer in the town, as soon as may be. 

The inhabitants and others are called upon to make 
known to the quartermaster-general, or any of his depu- 
ties, all stores belonging to the ministerial army, that 
may be remaining or secreted in the town ; any person 
or persons whatsoever, that shall be known to conceal 
any of the said stores, or appropriate them to his or their 
own use, will be considered as an enemy to America, 
and treated accordingly. 

The selectmen and other magistrates of the town are 
desired to return to the Commander-in-chief the names 
of all or any person or persons, they may suspect of be-

they may be dealt with accordingly. 

All officers of the Continental army are enjoined to 
assist the civil magistrates in the execution of their duty, 
and to promote peace and good order. They are to 
prevent, as much as possible, the soldiers from frequent- 
ing tippling-houses, and strolling from their posts. Par-

tentive and remiss in their duty ; and, on the contrary,

TO THE GENERAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY. 

>C r)/Uy) C • / X Cambridge, 21 March, 1776. 

JS^ r, .r^-^ Gentlemen, 

Ere now, I was in hopes of congratulating you on the 
departure of the ministerial troops, not only from your 
capital, but country. That they still remain in the har- 
bour, after having been five days embarked, affords mat- 
ter of speculation, and, collected as their force is now, 
of apprehension. This circumstance, the security of 
Boston by a work on Fort Hill and the demolition of the 
lines on the Neck, and preservation of the stores be- 
longing to the King for Continental use, by a proper 
search after them, rendered it indispensably necessary 
for me to throw some troops into the town immediately, 
it coming within the hne of my duty. But, notwith- 
standing all the precaution, which I have endeavoured 
to use, to restrain and limit the intercourse between the 
town and army and country for a few days, I greatly 
fear that the smallpox will be communicated. 

So soon as the fleet sets sail, my attention must be 
turned to another quarter, and most of the Continental 
regiments now here must be marched off. It may be 
necessary, therefore, for you. Gentlemen, to consider 
the state of your harbour, and think of such works as 
may be found necessary for the defence of it, and of the 
town also, in case another armed force, which I by no 
means expect, should be sent hither. I shall leave three 
or four regiments for the security of the stores, and

for throwing up such works as shall be deemed neces- 
sary for the purposes above mentioned ; and shall direct 
the officer commanding them to receive such instruc- 
tions, in respect to the latter, as you may think proper 
to give. It has been suggested to me, that, in the town 
of Boston, there is a good deal of property belonging to 
refugees, and such other inimical persons as, from the 
first of the present dispute, have manifested the most 
unfriendly disposition to the American cause ; and that 
part of this property is in such kind of effects, as can be 
easily transported, concealed, or changed. I submit to 
you, therefore, Gendemen, the expediency of having an 
inquiry made into this matter, before it is too late for re- 
dress, leaving the decision thereupon (after the quan- 
tum, or value, is ascertained, and held in a state of dur- 
ance) to the consideration of a future day. I have 
ordered, that no violence be offered by the soldiery, 
either to the persons or property of those people ; wish- 
ing that the matter may be taken into consideration by 
your honorable body, and in such a way as you shall 
judge most advisable.* The enclosed came to me a 



* The whole number of refugees, who left Boston with the British army, 
was more than a thousand. The following statement is taken from the 
official return, made to the government, and now deposited in the public 
offices in London. Members of the council, commissioners, custom-house 
officers, and other persons who had been in some official station, one hun- 
dred and two ; clergy, eighteen ; persons from the country, one hundred 
and five ; merchants and other inhabitants of Boston, two hundred and 
thirteen ; farmers, traders, and mechanics, three hundred and eighty-two ; 
total, nine hundred and twenty-four. All these returned their names on 
their arrival in Halifax. About two hundred others did not return their 
names. 

On tlie 25th of April, General Howe wrote from Halifax to Lord George 
Germain; — "Many of the principal inhabitants of Boston under the pro- 
tection of the army, having no means of subsistence here, apply to me to 
find them a passage to Europe, which they cannot otherwise get than at a 
most exorbitant rate. They have my assurance, that the first transport 
that can be spared shall be given up for this purpose. I am sorry to in- 
form your Lordship, that there is an absolute necessity of issuing pro-

few days ago, and I beg leave to recommend the pur- 
port of it to the consideration of the Court. I shall take 
the liberty to add, as my opinion, that the Congress ex- 
pect nothing else, than that the field-officers of the Mas- 
sachusetts regiments should receive the same pay, as 
those of the other colonies have done ; and that they 
expected, at the time the pay was fixed, that fifteen 
pounds to a colonel, twelve pounds to a lieutenant- 
colonel, and ten pounds to a major, was the actual es- 
tablishment of this government. I could wish, therefore, 
that they were allowed it, to remove the jealousies and 
uneasiness which have arisen. I am, with great respect 
and esteem, Gentlemen, &c. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

/^X . 1 , iS^/ tsiR, 

When I had the honor to address you on the 19th 
instant, upon the evacuation of the town of Boston by the 
ministerial army, I fully expected, as their retreat and 
embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before 
now, they would have departed from the harbour, and 
been far on their passage to the place of destination. But, 
to my surprise and disappointment, the fleet is still in 
Nantasket Road. The purpose inducing their stay is 

visions to the whole of them, about eleven hundred, from the King's stores, 
without any prospect of stopping it. It must be confessed, that many, 
having quitted the whole of their property and estates, some of them very 
considerable in value, are real objects of his Majesty's most gracious at- 
tention." — .WS. Letter. 

By the anny returns it likewise appears, that the British troops, includ- 
intr officers, at the time of the evacuation, amounted to eight thousand nine

altogether unknown ; nor can I suggest any satisfactory 
reason for it. On Wednesday night last, before the 
whole of the fleet fell down to Nantasket, they demol- 
ished the Castle, and houses belonging to it, by burning 
them down, and the several fortifications. They left a 
great number of the cannon, but have rendered all of 
them, except a very few, entirely useless, by breaking 
off" the trunnions. Those few they spiked up ; but they 
may be made serviceable again ; some are already done. 
There are several vessels in the docks, which were 
taken by the enemy, some with and others without car- 
goes, which different persons claim as their property 
and right. Are they to be restored to their former 
owners, on making proof of their title, or to belong to the 
Continent, as captures made from the enemy ? I wish 
Congress would direct a mode of proceeding against 
them, and establish a rule for decision. These appear 
to me to be highly necessary. In like manner, some of 
the cannon, which are in Boston, are said to have come 
from the Castle. Supposing them, with those remaining 
at the Castle, to have been purchased by and provided 
originally at the expense of this province, are they now 
to be considered as belonging to it, or to the public ? I 
beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congress, 
and pray their direction how I am to conduct respecting 
them. 

It having been suggested to me, that there was con- 
siderable property belonging to persons, who had, from 
the first of the present unhappy contest, manifested an 
unfriendly and inveterate disposition, in the town of 
Boston, I thought it prudent to write to the honorable 
General Court upon the subject, that it might be in- 
quired after and secured. A copy of the letter I here- 
with send you, and submit it to Congress, whether they 
will not determine how this property is to be disposed 



328 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEr. U. 

of, and as to the appropriation of the money arising 
from the sale of the same. 

As soon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I 
judged it advisable to secure the several heights, lest 
they should attempt to return ; and, for this purpose, 
have caused a large and strong work to be thrown up 
on Fort Hill, a post of great importance, as it commands 
the whole harbour, and, when fortified, if properly sup- 
ported, will greatly annoy any fleet the enemy may send 
against the town, and render the landing of their troops 
exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work 
is almost done, and in a little time will be complete ; 
and, that the communicadon between the town and 
country may be free and open, I have ordered all the 
lines upon the Neck to be immediately destroyed, and 
the other works on the sides of the town facing the 
country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be 
impeded, but afforded an easy entrance, in case the 
enemy should gain possession at any future time.* 
These matters I conceived to be within the line of my 
duty ; of which I advised the General Court, and recom- 
mended to their attention such other measures, as they 
might think necessary for securing the town against the 
hostile designs of the enemy. 

I have just got an inventory of stores and property 
belonging to the crown, which the enemy left in Boston, 
at the Casde, and Bunker's Hill, which I have the honor 
to transmit to you ; and shall give strict orders, that a

I shall take such precautions respecting them, that they 
may be secure, and turn to the public advantage, as 
much as possible, or as circumstances will admit of.

take the liberty of referring you to them. There have

Commissioners are coming to America, to propose terms 
for an accommodation, as they say, that I am inclined to 
think the time of their arrival not very far off. If they 
come to Boston, which probably will be the case, if they 
come to America at all, I shall be under much embarrass- 
ment respecting the manner of receiving them, and the 
mode of treatment, that ought to be used. I therefore 
pray, that Congress will give me directions, and point out 
the hue of conduct to be pursued ; whether they are to 
be considered as ambassadors, and to have a pass or per- 
mit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia, or 
to any other place ; or whether they are to be restrained 
in any and what manner. I shall anxiously wait their 
orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them 
hterally. I have the honor to be, &c. *

TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 25 March, 1776. 

My Dear Sir, 
Since my last, things remain nearly in statu quo. 
The enemy have the best knack at puzzling people I ev- 
er met with in my life. They have blown up, burnt, and 
demolished the Casde totally, and are now all in Nantas- 
k'et Road. They have been there ever since Wednesday. 
What they are doing, the Lord knows. Various are the 
conjectures. The Bostonians think their stay absolute- 
ly necessary to fit them for sea, as the vessels, neither 
in themselves nor their lading, were in any degree fit for 
a voyage, having been loaded in great haste and much 
disorder. This opinion is corroborated by a deserter 
from one of the transports, who says they have yards, 
booms, and bowsprits yet to fix. Others again think, that 
they have a mind to pass over the equinoctial gale be- 
fore they put out, not being in the best condidon to 
stand one ; others, that they are^ a reinforcement, which 
I believe has arrived, as I have had an account of 
the saihng of fifteen vessels from the West Indies. 
But my opinion of the matter is, that they want to re- 
trieve their disgrace before they go off, and I think a 
favorable opportunity presents itself to them. They 
have now got their whole force into one collected body, 
and no posts to guard. We have detached six regi- 
ments to New York, and have many points to look to, 
and, on Monday next, ten regiments of militia, which 
were brought in to serve till the first of April, will be 
disengaged. From former experience, w^e have found 
it as practicable to stop a torrent, as these people, when 
their time is up. If this should be the case now, what 
more favorable opening can the enemy wish for, to make 
a push upon our lines, nay, upon the back of our lines 



PartIL] the AMERICAN revolution. 331 

at RoxbuiT, as they can land two miles from them and 
pass behind ? I am under more apprehension from them 
now than ever, and am taking every precaution I can to 
guard against the evil ; but we have a kind of people 
to deal with, who will not fear danger till the bayonet 
is at their breast, and then they are susceptible enough 
of it. I am fortifying Fort Hill in Boston, and demol- 
ishing the lines on the Neck there, as they are a de- 
fence against the country only, and making such other 
dispositions, as appear necessary for a general defence. 
I can spare no more men till I see the enemy's back fairly 
turned, and then I shall hasten towards New York. 

You mention Mr. Webb in one of your letters for an 
assistant. He will be agreeable enough to me, if you think 
him qualified for the business. What kind of a hand he 
writes, I know not. I believe but a cramped one ; 
latterly none at all, as he has either the gout, or rheu- 
matism, or both. He is a man fond of company and 
gayety, and is of a tender constitution. Whether, there- 
fore, such a person would answer your purpose so well 
as a plodding, methodical person, whose sole business 
should be to arrange his papers in such order as to pro- 
duce any one at any instant it is called for, and capable 
at the same time of composing a letter, is what you have 
to consider. I can only add, that I have no one in view 
myself, and wish you success in your choice ; being 
with great truth and sincerity, dear Sir, your affectionate 
servant. 

P. S. I have taken occasion to hint to a certain 
gendeman in this camp, without introducing names, 
my apprehensions of his being concerned in trade. He 
protests most solemnly that he is not, directly nor indi- 
rectly.

TO COLONEL THOMAS MIFFLIN, QUARTER- 
MASTER-GENERAL. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

As the motions of tlie enemy, und the operations of 
the ensuing campaign, render it indispensably necessary, 
that a very large body of troops should be immediately 
assembled at or near New York, you will immediately 
proceed to Norwich in Connecticut, where you will, in 
concert with the Brigadier-Generals Heath and Sullivan, 
regulate the embarkation of the brigades under their 
command, and settle all such matters with the com- 
missary-general of provisions, and contracts for the 
transports, as may be further necessary for expediting 
the march of the rest of the army with the stores, ar- 
tillery, and camp equipage. This being done, you will 
proceed without delay to New York ; where your first 
care will be to provide barracks for the troops, firing, 
forage, and quarters for the general officers. Fix upon 
a proper house or houses for a general hospital, and sta- 
bling for the Continental draught-horses. Intrenching 
tools must also be immediately provided, with a sufiicient 
quantity of joists and planks for platforms, and timber for 
gun-carriages ; in short, every article necessary for the 
public service, and which your experience in the last 
campaign convinces you will be wanted in that now ap- 
proaching. 

The variety of the business of your department ren- 
ders it next to impossible to point out particularly every 
duty of your oflice. Therefore, a latitude is given you 
in these orders and instructions, which, together with 
the directions and advice of the commanding general 
at New York, must be the rule for the future regulation 
of your conduct ; and I shall at present only recom-

mend, that the same integrity, zeal, diligence, and ac- 
tivity, which has animated your past services, may 
govern that which is to come. Given at Head-Quar- 
ters, in Cambridge, this 24th day of March, 1776. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. « . ^ 

''^l/yV]fAA>W»trW Cambridge, 27 March, 177G. . <►, 7- -7 ^ 

Sir, ^^ -l . 'Jb^ 

I now beg leave to inform you, that I have just re- 
ceived intelligence that the whole of the ministerial 
fleet, besides three or four ships, got under way this 
evening at Nantasket Road, and were standing out for 
sea ; in consequence of which, I shall detach a brigade of 
six regiments immediately for New York, under the com- 
mand of Brigadier-General SuUivan (Brigadier-General 
Heath having gone with the first), which will be succeed- 
ed by another in a day or two ; and, directly after, I shall 
forward the remainder of the army, except four or five 
regiments, which will be left for taking care of the bar- 
racks and public stores, and fortifying the town, and 
erecting such works for its defence, as the General 
Court may think necessary ; and then follow myself. 
Apprehending that General Thomas will stand in need 
of some artiUerists in Canada, I have ordered two com- 
panies of the train to march immediately ; and two mor- 
tars, with a quantity of shells and shot, to be sent to 
him. He set out on the 21st instant.* Enclosed you 
have a copy of the return of ordnance stores left in 
Boston by the enemy. In it are not included the can- 
non left at the Castle, amounting to a hundred and

thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a 
very few, they have destroyed, or rendered useless, by 
knocking off the trunnions, and spiking them up. I 
beg leave to transmit to you the copy of a petition from 
the inhabitants of Nova Scotia, brought to me by Jona- 
than Eddy, mentioned therein, who is now here with 
an Acadian ; from which it appears, that they are in a 
distressed situation ; and, from Mr. Eddy's account, 
they are exceedingly apprehensive, that they will be 
reduced to the disagreeable alternative of taking up arms 
and joining our enemies, or of fleeing their country, unless 
they can be protected against their insults and oppres- 
sions. He says that their committees think many salu- 
tary and valuable consequences would be derived from 
five or six hundred men being sent there, as it would 
not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety 
and uneasiness they are now filled with, and enable 
them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be 
the means of preventing the Indians, of whom there are 
a good many, from taking the side of government, and 
the ministerial troops from getting such supplies of pro- 
visions from thence as they have done. 

How far these good purposes would be answered, if 
such a force were sent, as they ask for, it is impossible to 
determine in the present uncertain state of things. For, 
if the army from Boston is going to Halifax, as reported 
by them before their departure, that, or a much more 
considerable force would be of no avail ; if not, and they 
possess the friendly disposition to our cause, suggested 
in the petition and declared by Mr. Eddy, it might be 
of great service, unless another body of troops should 
be sent thither by administration, too powerful for them 
to oppose. It being a matter of some importance, I 
judged it prudent to lay it before Congress for their 
consideration ; and, requesting their direction upon the 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 335 

subject, shall only add, if they determine to adopt it, 
that they will prescribe the number to be sent, and 
whether it is to be from the regiments, which will be 
left here. I shall wait their decision, and, whatever it 
is, will endeavour to have it carried into execution.* wi<.c*- 0~p^*X.(»

ANSWER TO AN ADDRESS FROM THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OF MASSACHUSTTS. 



-V ^ 



Gentlemen, ^^Ct, /. ^ ' 

I return you my most sincere and hearty thanks for (§^^ 
your poUte address ; and feel myself called upon by 
every principle of gratitude, to acknowledge the honor 
you have done me in this testimonial of your approba- 
tion of my appointment to the exalted station I now fill, 

* There seems to have been in Nova Scotia a strong spirit of opposi- 
tion to tlie government, and a tendency to join with the other colonies in 
open resistance, particularly among the Acadians. The petition above- 
mentioned was dated on the 8th of February, and signed by twelve per- 
sons, resident in Cumberland county, and members of different com- 
mittees, who had acted, it would appear, with some degree of secrecy, 
and under fear of the government. Threatening proclamations iiad been 
issued, and measures adopted for raising a military force. The petitioners 
say; — "We agreed in our committees, that nothing should be done pub- 
licly, as it might instigate the others to fall upon us sooner than they in- 
tended, and as we could not tell what was the intention of the Continen- 
tal Congress concerning us. Therefore we pray ardently, tliat your 
Excellency wUl please to relieve us, that we may be able to express our 
sentiments publicly, and join our little strength with the other colonies in 
preventing the ensigns of slavery from being set up in any part of tliis 
great empire. We further desire, that tliis our request may be kept a 
secret for the present." 

A member of one of the committees also wrote a private letter to 
Washington, in which he said; — "The great contest between Britain 
and America has hitherto been only treated speculatively among us. - I 
presume a sympathy with our brethren on the continent reigns in the 
breasts of tlie generality of the inhabitants. With gladness would we be 
active in the glorious struggle, if our situation and circumstances were 



336 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

and, what is more pleasing, of my conduct in discharging 
its important duties. 

When the councils of the British nation had formed 
a plan for enslaving America, and deprivmg her sons of 
their most sacred and invaluable privileges, against the 
clearest remonstrances of the constitution, of justice, 
and of truth, and, to execute their schemes, had ap- 
pealed to the sword, I esteemed it my duty to take a 
part in the contest, and more especially on account of 
my being called thereto by the unsolicited suffrages of 
the representatives of a free people; wishing for no 
other reward, than that arising from a conscientious 
discharge of the important trust, and that my services 
might contribute to the establishment of freedom and 
peace, upon a permanent foundation, and merit the ap- 
plause of my countrymen, and every virtuous citizen. 

YouracknowledgmenC of my attention to the civil con- 
stitution of this colony, whilst acting in the line of my 
department, also demands my grateful thanks. A regard 
to every Provincial institution, where not incompatible 
with the common interest, I hold a principle of duty 
and of policy, and it shall ever form a part of my conduct. 
Had I not learnt this before, the happy experience of 
the advantages resulting from a friendly intercourse 



such, as to afford the least glimpse of success ; but our remoteness from 
tlie other colonies and our form of government, joined with tlie indigence 
of the inliabitants, render it in a manner impossible without succour from 
some other quarter. As to the Acadians, I have dwelt among tliem near 
twenty years, and am well acquainted witli tlicir manners and ways. 
They are to a man wholly inclined to the cause of America. There are 
but about two hundred regular troops in Halifax, including raw recruits 
from Newfoundland and other places. Had we at present two or three 
hundred men, they would secure aU that part of the province between this 
place and Halifax." 

As the British army, lately embarked from Boston, had sailed for Hali- 
fax, it was of course inexpedient for Congress to attempt any relief to tlie 
petitioners by sending troops to Nova Scotia. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 



337 



with your honorable body, their ready and willing con- 
currence to aid and to counsel, whenever called upon in 
cases of difficulty and emergency, would have taught 
me the useful lesson. 

That the metropolis of your colony is now relieved 
from the cruel and oppressive invasions of those, who 
were sent to erect the standard of lawless domination, and 
to trample on the rights of humanity, and is again open 
and free for its rightful possessors, must give pleasure 
to every virtuous and sympathetic heart ; and its being 
effected without the blood of our soldiers and fellow- 
citizens must be ascribed to the interposition of that 
Providence, which has manifestly appeared in our behalf 
through the whole of this important struggle, as well as 
to the measures pursued for bringing about the happy 
event. 

May that Being, who is powerful to save, and in whose 
hands is the fate of nations, look down with an eye of 
tender pity and compassion upon the whole of the Uni- 
ted Colonies ; may he continue to smile upon their 
counsels and arms, and crown them with success, whilst 
employed in the cause of virtue and mankind. May 
this distressed colony and its capital, and every part of 
this wide extended continent, through his divine favor, 
be restored to more than their former lustre and once 
happy state, and have peace, liberty, and safety secured 
upon a soUd, permanent, and lasting foundation.

Sir, 



As there are the best reasons to believe, that the 
enemy's fleet and army, which left Nantasket Road last 

VOL. IIL 43 CO 



338 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [iEx. 44. 

Wednesday evening, are bound to New York, to en- 
deavour to possess that important post, and, if possible, 
secure the communication by Hudson's River to Cana- 
da, it must be our care to prevent them from accom- 
plishing their designs. To that end, I have detached 
Brigadier-General Heath with the whole body of I'ifle- 
men and five battalions of the Continental army, by the 
way of Norwich in Connecticut, to New York. These, 
by an express arrived yesterday from General Heath, I 
have reason to believe are in New York. Six more 
battalions under General Sullivan march this morning 
by the same route, and will, I hope, arrive there in eight 
or ten days at farthest. The rest of the army will im- 
mediately follow in divisions, leaving only a convenient 
space between each division, to prevent confusion and 
want of accommodation upon their march. 

You will no doubt make the best despatch in getting 
to New York. Upon your arrival there, you v\ill as- 
sume the command, and immediately proceed in con- 
tinuing to execute the plan proposed by Major-General 
Lee, for fortifying that city and securing the passes of 
the East and North Rivers. If, upon consultation with 
the brigadier-generals and engineers, any alteradon in 
that plan is thought necessary, you are at liberty to 
make it ; cautiously avoiding to break in too much upon 
his main design, unless where it may be apparently 
necessary so to do, and that by the general voice and 
opinion of the gendemen above mentioned. 

You will meet the quartermaster-general. Colonel 
Mifflin, and the commissary -general, at New York. As 
they are both men of excellent talents in their different 
departments, you will do well to give them all the au- 
thority and assistance they require ; and should a council 
of war be necessary, it is my direction they shall assist 
at it. Your long service and experience will, better 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 339 

than any particular directions at this distance, point out 
to you the works most proper to be lirst raised ; and 
your perseverance, activity, and zeal will lead you, 
without my recommending it, to exert every nerve to 
disappoint the enemy's designs. 

Devoutly praying, that the Power, which has hitherto 
sustained the American arms, may continue to bless 
them with his divine protection, I bid you farewell. 
Given at Head-Quarters, in Cambridge, this 29th day 
of March, 1776. 



TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. 

Cambridge, 31 March, 1776. 

Dear Brother, 

Your letter of the 24th ultimo was duly forwarded to 
this camp by Colonel Lee, and gave me the pleasure of 
hearing that you, my sister, and family were well. Af- 
ter your post is established to Fredericksburg, the 
intercourse by letter may become regular and certain ; 
and whenever time, little of which I have for friendly 
correspondences, will permit, I shall be happy in writing 
to you. I cannot call to mind the date of my last to 
you, but this I recollect, that I have written more letters 
than I have received from you. 

The want of arms and powder is not peculiar to 
Virginia.* This country, of which doubdess you have 

* The people on the Chesapeake Bay, and the rivers emptying into it, 
had been alarmed during the winter by reports, that the enemy were about 
to ascend with their ships and water-craft, and lay waste the country. To 
escape the threatened danger, many of the inhabitants retired to the 
interior, taking with them such parts of their property as could be removed. 
General Washington's residence on the banks of the Potomac was ac- 
cessible to the approach of the largest ships, and it was rumored that the 
enemy intended paying it a visit. Mr. Lund Washington wrote to him 
from Mount Vernon ; — " Ale.xandria is much alarmed, and indeed the 



340 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mi: U. 

heard large and flattering accounts, is more deficient 
in both than you can conceive. I have been here 
months together, with (what will scarcely be believed) 
not thirty rounds of musket cartridges to a man ; and 
have been obliged to submit to all the insults ol' the 
enemy's cannon for want of powder, keeping what little 
we had for pistol distance. Another thing has been 
done, which, added to the above, will put it in the power 
of this army to say, what perhaps no other with justice 
ever could say. We have maintained our ground 
against the enemy, under this want of powder, and we 
have disbanded one army, and recruited another, Avithin 
musket-shot of two and twenty regiments, the flower of 
the British army, whilst our force has been but little if 
any superior to theirs ; and, at last, have beaten them 
into a shameful and precipitate retreat out of a place the 
strongest by nature on this continent, and strengthened 
and fortified at an enormous expense. 

As some account of the late manoeuvres of both 
armies may not be unacceptable, I shall, hurried as I 
always am, devote a htde time to it. Having received 
a small supply of powder, very inadequate to our wants, 
I resolved to take possession of Dorchester Point, lying 
east of Boston, looking directly into it, and commanding 

whole neighbourhood. The women and children are leaving the town 
and stowing themselves in every hut they can find, out of the reach of the 
enemy's cannon. Every wagon, cart, and pack-horse, that can be got, is 
employed. The militia are all up, but not in arms, for indeed they have 
none, or at least very few. I could wish, if we are to have our neighbour- 
hood invaded, that they would send a tender or two among us, that we 
might see how the people would behave on the occasion. They say they 
are determined to fight. I am about pacl<ing up your China and glass in 
barrels, and otlier things into chests, trunks, and bundles, and I shall be 
able at the shortest notice to remove them out of the way. I fear the 
destruction will be great, although the best care has been taken. Every 
body I see tells me, that if the people could have notice they would immedi- 
ately come and defend your property, so long as they have life, from Lou- 
doun, Prince William, Fauquier, and this county." 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 341 

the enemy's lines on Boston Neck. To do this, which 
I knew would force the enemy to an engagement, or 
subject them to be enfiladed by our cannon, it was 
necessary, in the first instance, to possess two heights 
(those mentioned in General Burgoyne's letter to Lord 
Stanley, in his account of the battle of Bunker's Hill), 
which had the entire command of the point. The 
ground at this time being frozen upwards of two feet 
deep, and as impenetrable as a rock, nothing could be 
attempted with earth. We were obliged, therefore, to 
provide an amazing quantity of chandeliers and fascines 
for the work ; and, on the night of the 4th, after a previ- 
ous severe cannonade and bombardment for three nights 
together, to divert the enemy's attention from our real 
design, we removed every material to the spot, under 
cover of darkness, and took full possession of those 
heights, without the loss of a single man. 

Upon their discovery of the works next morning, 
great preparations were made for attacking them ; but 
not being ready before the afternoon, and the weather 
getting very tempestuous, much blood was saved, and 
a very important blow, to one side or the other, was 
prevented. That this most remarkable interposition of 
Providence is for some wise purpose, I have not a doubt. 
But, as the principal design of the manoeuvre was to 
draw the enemy to an engagement under disadvantages 
to them, as a premeditated plan was laid for this purpose, 
and seemed to be succeeding to my utmost wish, and 
as no men seemed better disposed to make the appeal 
than ours did upon that occasion, I can scarcely forbear 
lamenting the disappointment, unless the dispute is 
drawing to an accommodation, and the sword going 
to be sheathed. But, to return, the enemy thinking, 
as we have since learnt, that we had got too se- 
curely posted, before the second morning, to be much

hurt by them, and apprehending great annoyance from 
our new works, resolved upon a retreat, and according- 
ly on the 1 7th embarked in as much hurry, precipitation, 
and confusion, as ever troops did, not taking time to fit 
their transports, but leaving the King's property in Bos- 
ton, to the amount, as is supposed, of thirty or forty 
thousand pounds in provisions and stores. Many pieces 
of cannon, some mortars, and a number of shot and 
shells are also left; and baggage- wagons and artillery- 
carts, which they have been eighteen months preparing 
to take the field with, were found destroyed, thrown 
into the docks, and drifted upon every shore. In short, 
Dunbar's destruction of stores after General Braddock's 
defeat, which made so much noise, affords but a faint 
idea of what was to be met with here. 

The enemy lay from the 17th to the 27th in Nantas- 
ket and King's Roads, about nine miles from Boston, to 
take in water from the islands thereabouts, and to prepare 
themselves for sea. Whither they are now bound, and 
where their tents will be next pitched, I know not ; but, 
as New York and Hudson's River are the most impor- 
tant objects they can have in view, as the latter secures 
the communication with Canada, at the same time that 
it separates the northern and southern colonies, and the 
former, is thought to abound in disaflfected persons, who 
only wait a favorable opportunity and support to declare 
themselves openly, it became equally important for us 
to prevent their gaining possession of these advantages ; 
and, therefore, as soon as they embarked, I detached a 
brigade of six regiments to that government, and, when 
they sailed, another brigade composed of the same 
number; and to-morrow another brigade of five regi- 
ments will march. In a day or two more, I shall follow 
myself, and be in New York ready to receive all but 
the first. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 343 

The enemy left all their works standing in Boston 
and on Bunker's Hill ; and formidable they are. The 
town has shared a much better fate than was expected, 
the damage done to the houses being nothing equal to 
report. But the inhabitants have suffered a good deal, 
in being plundered by the soldiery at their departui-e. 
All those who took upon themselves the style and title 
of government-men in Boston, in short, all those who 
have acted an unfriendly part in this great contest, have 
shipped themselves off in the same hurry, but under 
still greater disadvantages than the King's troops, being 
obliged to man their own vessels, as seamen enough 
could not be had for the King's transports, and submit 
to every hardship that can be conceived. One or two 
have done, what a great number ought to have done long 
ago, committed suicide. By all accounts, there never 
existed a more miserable set of beings, than these 
wretched creatures now are. Taught to believe, that 
the power of Great Britain was superior to all opposi- 
tion, and, if not, that foreign aid was at hand, they were 
even higher and more insulting in their opposition than 
the regulars. When the order issued, therefore, for em- 
barking the troops in Boston, no electric shock, no sud- 
den explosion of thunder, in a word, not the last trump 
could have struck them with greater consternation. 
They were at their wits' end, and, conscious of their 
black ingratitude, they chose to commit themselves, in 
the manner I have above described, to the mercy of the 
waves at a tempestuous season, rather than meet then- 
offended countrymen. 

I believe I may with great truth affirm, that no man per- 
haps since the first institution of armies ever commanded 
one under more difficult circumstances, than I have done. 
To enumerate the particulars would fill a volume. 
Many of my difficulties and distresses were of so pecu-

liar a cast, that, in order to conceal them from the ene- 
my, I was obliged to conceal them from my friends, and 
indeed from my own army, thereby subjecting my con- 
duct to interpretations unfavorable to my character, 
especially by those at a distance, who could not in the 
smallest degree be acquainted with the springs that 
governed it. I am happy, however, to find, and to hear 
from different quarters, that my reputation stands fair, 
that my conduct hitherto has given universal satisfaction. 
The addresses, which I have received, and which I 
suppose will be published, from the General Court of 
this colony, and from the selectmen of Boston upon the 
evacuation of the town, and my approaching departure 
from the colony, exhibit a pleasing testimony of their 
approbation of my conduct, and of their personal re- 
gard, which I have found in various other instances, and 
which, in retirement, will afford many comfortable re- 
flections. 

The share you have taken in the public disputes is 
commendable and praiseworthy. It is a duty we owe 
our country ; a claim which posterity has upon us. It 
is not sufficient for a man to be a passive friend and 
well-wisher to the cause. This, and every other cause 
of such a nature, must inevitably perish under such an 
opposition. Every person should be active in some de- 
partment or other, without paying too much attention to 
private interest. It is a great stake we are playing for, 
and sure we are of winning, if the cards are well man- 
aged. Inactivity in some, disaffection in others, and 
timidity in many, may hurt the cause. Nothing else 
can ; for unanimity will carry us through triumphantly, 
in spite of every exertion of Great Britain, if we are 
linked together in one indissoluble bond. This the 
leaders know, and they are practising every stratagem 
to divide us, and unite their own people. Upon this

principle it is, that the restraining bill is passed, and 
commissioners are coming over. The device, to be 
sure, is shallow, the covering thin, but they will hold out 
to their own people, that the acts complained oi" are re- 
pealed, and commissioners sent to each colony to treat 
with us, and that we will attend to neither of them. 
This, upon weak minds among us, will have its effect. 
They wish for reconciliation ; or, in other words, they 
wish for peace without attending to the conditions. 

General Lee, I suppose, is with you before this. He 
is the first officer, in military knowledge and experience, 
we have in the whole army. He is zealously attached 
to the cause, honest and well-meaning, but rather fickle 
and violent, I fear, in his temper. However, as he pos- 
sesses an uncommon share of good sense and spirit, I 
congratulate my countrymen * upon his appointment to 



* Before the revolution, and at the time now in view, it was common for 
persons to speak of their native colony as their country, and of tlie inhabit- 
ants of that colony as their countrymen. In this sense the word is used in 
the present instance, meaning Virginians. The same use of the word not 
unfrequendy occurs in Washington's letters, before and during the revolu- 
tion, and in other writings of that period. 

General Lee, who was now at Williamsburg, wrote to Washington a 
letter dated April 5th, complimenting him on the evacuation of Boston in 
the following language. 

" I most sincerely congratulate you, I congratulate the public, on the 
great emd glorious event, your possession of Boston. It will be a most 
bright page in the annals of America, and a most abominably black one in 
those of the beldam Britain. Go on, my dear General, crown yourself with 
glory, and establish the liberties and lustre of your country on a founda- 
tion more permanent than the Capitol Rock. My situation is just as I ex- 
pected. I am afraid I shall make a shabby figure, without any real de- 
merits of my own. I am like a dog in a dancing-school. I know not 
where to turn myself, where to fix myself. The circumstances of the 
country intersected by navigable rivers, the uncertainty of tlie enemy's de- 
signs and motions, who can fly in an instant to any spot they choose with 
their canvass wings, throw me, and would throw Julius Cssar, into tliis 
inevitable dilemma. I may possibly be in the nortli, when, as Richard

that department. As I am now nearly at the end of my 
eighth page, I think it time to conclude ; especially, as I 
set out with prefacing the little time I had for friendly 
correspondences. I shall only add, therefore, my affec- 
tionate regards to my sister and the children, and com- 
pliments to friends ; and that I am, with every senti- 
ment of true affection, your loving brother and faithful 
friend. 



TO JOSEPH REED. 

Cambridge, 1 April, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 15th ultimo contained a very un- 
favorable account of the Carolinas, but I am glad to find 
/i .^, J, , . . ,» . by the subsequent one that the prospect brightens, and 

that Mr. Martin's first attempt has met with its deserved 
success. The old proverb, of " the first blow being 
half the battle," cannot better apply than in these in- 
stances, the spirits of the vanquished being depressed 
in proportion as the victors get elated. I am glad to 
find my camp equipage in such forwardness. I shall 
expect to meet it, and I hope you, at New York, for 
which place I am preparing to set out on Thursday or 
Friday next. 

The accounts brought by Mr. Temple, of the favor- 
able disposition in the ministry to accommodate matters, 
does not correspond with their speeches in Parliament. 
How then does he account for their inconsistency ? If 

grate your ears with a truth, but must at all events assure you, that the 
Provincial Congress of New York are angels of decision, when compared 
with your countrymen, the Committee of Safety assembled at Williams- 
burg. Page, Lee, Mercer, and Payne are indeed exceptions ; but from 
Pendleton, Bland, the Treasurer, and company, libera nos, Domine." 



Part II.] THE Ai\[ERICAN REVOLUTION. 347 

the commissioners do not come over with full and ample 
powers to treat with Congress, I sincerely wish they 
may never put their feet on American ground, as it must 
be self-evident, in the other case, that they will come 
over with insidious intentions, to distract, divide, and 
create as much confusion as possible. How then can 
any man, let his passion for reconciliation be ever so 
strong, be so blinded and misled, as to embrace a meas- 
ure evidently designed for his destruction? No man 
does, no man can, wish the restoration of peace more 
fervently than I do ; but I hope, whenever made, it will 
be upon such terms, as will reflect honor upon the coun- 
cils and wisdom of America. With you, I think a 
change in the American representation necessary. Fre- 
quent appeals to the people can be attended with no 
bad, but may have very salutary effects. My country- 
men I know, from their form of government, and steady 
attachment heretofore to royalty, will come reluctantly 
into the idea of independence, but time and persecution 
bring many wonderful things to pass ; and by private 
letters, which I have lately received from Virginia, I find 
" Common Sense " is working a powerful change there 
in the minds of many men.* 

* Colonel Reed had written, March 3d ; — " Notwithstanding the act of 
Parliament for seizing our property, and a thousand other proofs of a bitter 
and irreconcilable spirit, there is a strange reluctance in the minds of 
many to cut tlie knot, which ties us to Great Britain, particularly in this 
colony and to the southward. Though no man of understanding expects 
any good from the commissioners, yet they are for waiting to hear their 
proposals, before they declare off. However, yesterday I was informed, 
that letters had been sent to France, to know what encouragement we 
might expect from that quarter. Our coast is yet clear ; it is a golden 
opportunity to make provision for the war, which I hope will not be lost." 
Again, March 15th; — "It is said tlie Virginians are so alarmed with the 
idea of independence, that they have sent Mr. Braxton on purpose to turn 
the vote of that colony, if any question on tliat subject should come before 
Congress. To tell you the truth, my dear Sir, I am infinitely more afraid 
of these commissioners, than of their generals and armies. If their propo-

The four thousand men destined for Boston on the

Dorchester Heights, or the lines at Roxbury, were to 
have been headed by General Putnam. But he would 
have had pretty easy work of it, as his motions were to 
have been regulated by signals, and those signals by ap- 
pearances. He was not to have made the attempt, un-

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL ARNOLD, IN CANADA. 
1 ^Hxht. %B ^ Cambridge, 3 AprU, 1776. 

Your favor of the 27th of February is come to hand. 
I much fear you will be disappointed in the number of 
troops you expected in that month, as the lakes were 
impassable. I have despatched two companies of Colo- 
nel Knox's regiment of artillery to you from hence, two 
mortars, and other articles, as you will see at the foot 
hereof. If any thing else is wanting that cannot be had 
in Canada, and in my power to send, it shall be for- 
warded with all possible expedition, upon my being in- 
informed thereof. The chief part of the troops are 
marched hence towards New York. I shall set off to- 
morrow. If the enemy will not find us full employment 
and it is necessary, you may expect a detachment from 

sitions are plausible, and behaviour artful, I am apprehensive they will 
divide us. There is so much suspicion in Congress, and so much party 
on this subject, that very little more fuel is required to kindle the flame. 
It is high time for the colonies to begin a gradual change of delegates. 
Private pique, prejudice, and suspicion will make their way into the breasts 
of even good men sitting long in such a conned as ours ; and whenever 
that is the case, their deliberations will be disturbed, and the public inter- 
est of course will suffer."

thence to your assistance. I am very sorry, that the 
gentlemen from New York and other officers should 
think themselves neglected in the new arrangement. 
It is true that I reserved places in this army for those 
officers, who went from hence under your command. 
The Congress have since informed me, that they would 
be provided for in the army raised for Canada. I was 
not acquainted with the gentlemen, who complain, nor 
with their circumstances. There is little doubt, but their 
merits will be rewarded in due time.* I am very sensi- 
ble of the many difficulties you have had to encounter. 
Your conduct under them does you great honor. As 
General Thomas will take the burthen off your shoul- 
ders, I hope you will soon gather strength sufficient to 
assist in finishing the important work, which you have 
with so much glory to yourself and service to your 
country hitherto conducted. 

As I am informed, that there is a furnace somewhere 
neai" you, where shells and shot of any size can be cast, 
I would recommend to General Thomas to have the 
quantity of each, that may be wanting, immediately pre- 
pared. The roads are so very bad, that it is impossible 
to send you any great number of these necessary arti- 
cles from hence. I have appointed Captain Lamb, who 
is a prisoner at Quebec, to be second major in the regi- 
ment of artillery, commanded by Colonel Henry Knox. 
The gentlemen of this family return you their compli- 
ments, and my best wishes attend General Thomas. 

I remain. Sir, yours, &c. 

* The regiments sent to Canada from New York had never been in- 
cluded in the army under the immediate command nfWashington, and for 
this reason they were not taken into the new arrangement. The officers 
complained of this neglect, particularly as Colonel Enos, and those with 
him, who deserted the expedition to Canada and returned home, had been 
promoted.

Cambridge, 4 April, 1776. 



It is not in my power to make report of the deficiency 
of arms, in compliance with the direction of Congress, 
at this time, as some of the regiments are at New York, 
and most of the others on their march ; nor do I know 
that it would answer any good purpose, if it were, hav- 
ing made repeated applications to the several assemblies 
and conventions upon the subject, and constantly re- 
ceived for answer, that they could afford no relief. A 
proclamation of General Howe's, issued a few days be- 
fore his departure from town, having fallen into my 
hands, I have enclosed you a copy, which may probably 
have been the occasion of large quantities of goods being 
carried away, and the removal of many persons, which 
otherwise would not have happened.* 

Colonel Warren, paymaster-general, finding the army 
likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other 
day, that the situation of his affairs and engagements in 
the business of the colony are such, as to prevent him 
from personally attending the army ; and offered, in 
case it should be required, to resign. This was rather 
embarrassing. To me it appears indispensably neces- 
sary that the paymaster-general, with his books, should 
be at or near head-quarters. Indeed it is usual for the 
head of every department in the army, however dis- 
persed that army may be, to be with the commanding 



* The foUowing is an extract from the proclamation. — "As linen and 
woollen goods are articles much wanted by the rebels, and would aid and 
assist them in their rebellion, the Commander-in-chief expects, that all 
good subjects will use their utmost endeavours to have all such articles 
conveyed from this place." Provision was likewise made for receiving 
them on board a vessel.

genera], keeping deputies in the smaller departments. 
On the other hand, Colonel Warren's merit and attach- 
ment to the cause are such, that I could do nothing less 
than desire, as some money must be left for the pay 
and contingent charges of the army which will remain 
here, that he would wait here till Congress shall be 
pleased to give their sentiments upon the matter.* 

I would also mention to Congress, that the militia 
regiments, which were last called upon, in making up 
their abstracts, charged pay, the officers from the time 
they received orders to raise companies, and the pri- 
vates from the time they respectively engaged to come, 
or were called upon, though they did not march for a 
considerable time after, some not within three, four, to 
twenty days, during all which they remained at home 
about their own private affairs, without doing any thing 
else than "preparing for the march," as they say by 
way of plea. This appeared to me so exceedingly un- 
reasonable, and so contrary to justice, that the public 
should pay for a longer time than from the day of their 
march to that of their return, that I ordered the ab- 
stracts to be made out accordingly, and refused to give 
warrants on any other terms. They say that the en- 
listing orders, which went out from their governments, 
give them the pay they claim. The fact may be, that 
something in these may seem to authorize it ; but I must 
submit it to Congress, and wish for their decision, 
whether the Continent must pay it. I am, &c. f 

* Colonel Warren resigned the office of paymaster-general ; and Colonel 
Palfrey was appointed as his successor on the 27th of April. 

f Congress decided, that the pay of these troops should commence on 
the day of their march, and end on that of their return.

New Haven, 11 April, 1776. 

Sir, 

I received yours of the 9th instant, and could wish 
that it was in my power, consistently with the duty I owe 
my country, to grant you the relief you desire. I have 
made repeated applications to General Howe for an ex- 
change of prisoners, but he has not thought proper to 
return me any answer. It has been in his power to set 
you at liberty ; and if you are still continued a prisoner, 
the blame must he entirely upon him. 

The situation of your family is indeed distressing; 
but such is the event of war ; it is far from being singular. 
The brave Colonel Allen, an officer of rank, has been 
torn from his dearest connexions, sent to England in 
irons, and is now confined to the most servile drudgery 
on board one of the King's ships. Your treatment. Sir, 
and that of the other officers taken in arms against the 
liberties of America, has been very different; for the 
truth of this I appeal to your own feelings. Whenever 
it is in my power to release you by a mutual exchange, 
I shall do it with the greatest pleasure ; and am. Sir, 
your most obedient servant.

order to block up your squadron in that harbour. ^I ' ' ^ 

thought it my duty to give you notice of this by ex- 
press, that you might take your measures accordingly. 
The Phoenix, Savage, and Nautilus sailed this morning. 
The Asia still remains in the harbour. I should be much 
obliged to you, if you would forward the cannon and 
stores for which I left a hst with you, as soon as possible ; 
and as the men-of-war are now out, I should be ex- 
tremely glad if you would keep a good look out to see 
that the coast is clear, before any more of the Continen-

of the council, and Mr. Bavage, secretary, and a half-pay officer, and also 
seventy prisoners ; besides a quantity of ordnance and military stores 
taken from Fort Nassau and Fort Montague. Among them were eighty- 
eight cannon, from nine to thirty-sLx pounders, fifteen mortars, more tlian 
five thousand shells, eleven thousand round shot, twenty-four casks of 
powder, and other articles of less importance. 

The conduct of Commodore Hopkins in this cruise was disapproved by 
Congress. His orders were to annoy the enemy's ships on the coast of 
the southern states, and he was called before Congress to give his reasons 
for not complying with them after his descent upon Providence Island, 
instead of returning with his fleet to New London. 

The President of Congress wrote to Washington on the 14tli of June ; 
— " The shameful inactivity of our fleet for some time past ; the frequent 
neglect or disobedience of orders in Commodore Hopkins ; the number- 
less complaints exhibited to the marine committee against him, and also 
against Captains Saltonstall and Wliipple, have induced the Congress, in 
consequence of a representation from the marine committee, to order them 
to repair immediately to this city to answer for their conduct. I have 
accordingly written to them to set out, on the receipt of my letters, and to 
repair hitlier by land as fast as possible. I hope soon to have our sliips on 
a more respectable footing. No efi:brts of mine shall be wanting to ac- 
complish so desirable an event." 

After due inquiry, deliberation, and debate, Congress \ ^ted, that the 
reasons ofiored by the Commodore were not satisfactory, and that he de- 
served the censure of that house, which censure was accordingly in- 
flicted. — Journals, .iugust, 15th, IGth, 1776. His achievement in taking

/ I am now to inform you, that on the 4th instant I set 

out from Cambridge, and arrived here on Saturday last. 
I came through Providence, Norwich, and New London, 
in order to see and expedite the embarkation of the 
troops. The third brigade, under tlie command of 
General Greene, was at New London when I left it, 
where there was a sufficient number of transports to 
embark them; and most probably they would have 
arrived here before this, had it not been for a severe 
storm, which happened the night they sailed, which dis- 
persed them, and, I fear, has done them some injury. 
General Spencer, with the last brigade, marched from 
Roxbury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at 
New London, ready to embark in the return transports, 
which brought General Sullivan's division to this place. 
The whole of the troops may be reasonably expected 
here in the course of this week. The badness of the 
roads, and difficulty of procuring teams for bringing the 
stores and baggage, have greatly prolonged their arrival. 
I have not had time, since I came, to look fully about 
me ; but I find many works of defence begun, and some 
finished. The troops are much dispersed, some on 
Long Island, others on Staten Island. 

I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, 

tlie governor of a smaU island prisoner, and dismantling two forts feebly 
defended, did not comport with the dignity, which Congress had attached 
to the enterprise, nor the expectations they had formed in fitting out the

and am taking measures to have them forwarded to Al- 
bany by watei-, with all possible expedition. This will 
greatly expedite their arrival, and ease the men of much 
fatigue. I have written to General Schuyler of their 
coming, that he may have necessary measures taken to 
hurry their march to General Thomas. I am informed 
by General Putnam that the militia, who were called in 
for the support of this town, in case the ministerial 
army had arrived before our troops, are all discharged, 
it being unnecessary to keep them longer. All the 
ships of war, besides the Asia, moved out of this harbour 
on Saturday, and the Asia yesterday ; some of which 
are now below the Narrows, and the rest gone to sea. 
Your favor of the 10th instant by Major Sherburne, 
directed to General Putnam or the commanding officer 
here, came to hand on Saturday evening, with three 
boxes of money, which I shall deliver to the paymaster 
as soon as he arrives, and transmit you his receipt for the 
same. Having received information from hence before 
my departure from Cambridge, that thirty pieces of 
heavy cannon were wanting, and essentially necessary 
for the defence of this place, in addition to those already 
here, I took the liberty of applying to Commodore 
Hopkins, whom I saw at New London, for that number, 
with the mortars and stores he brought from Providence 
Island, a list of which he had transmitted to you. He 
told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of 
Providence River and the harbour at New London, it 
was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted ; but 
that he would send me all that could be spared. I have 
not been able to get a return of the troops since I came. 
As soon as I do it, I will send it to you. 

I am, Sir, with great respect, &c.

TO JOHN ADAMS, IN CONGRESS. 

New York, 15 April, 1/70. 

Sir, 

C This morning your polite letter of the 1st instant was 
delivered to me by Mr. Dana. I am much obliged to 
you for your introduction of that gentleman, and you 
may rely on my showing him every civility in my 
power.* r 

I have ever thought, and am still of opinion, that 
no terms of accommodation will be offered by the 
British ministry, but such as cannot be accepted by 
America. We have nothing, my dear Sir, to depend 
upon but the protection of a kind Providence, and una- 
nimity among ourselves. I am impressed with the 
deepest gratitude for the high honor intended me by 
y Congress. Whatever device may be determined upon 

by the respectable committee they have chosen for that 
purpose will be highly agreeable to me.f I have the 
honor to be, most respectfully, Sir, your obedient and 
affectionate humble servant. 



* From Mr. .Adams's letter. — "The bearer of this letter, Mr. Francis 
Dan.a of Cambridge, is a gentleman of family, fortune, and education, re- 
turned in the last packet from London, wliere he lias been about a year. 
He has ever maintained an excellent character in his country, and a warm 
friendsliip for the American cause. He returns to share with his friends 
in their dangers and their triumphs. I have done myself the honor to 
give him tliis letter, for the sake of introducing him to your acquaintance, 
as he has frequently expressed to me his desire to embrace the first op- 
portunity of paying his respects to a character so highly esteemed, and so

TO JOSEPH REED. 

New York, 15 April, 1776. 

My Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 13th was this instant put into my 
hands, scarcely in time to acknowledge the receipt of it 
by this post, and to thank you for your great care and 
attention in providing my camp equipage. 

I am exceedingly concerned to hear of the divisions 
and parties, which prevail with you, and in the southern 
colonies, on the score of independence. These are the 
shelves we have to avoid, or our bark will split and 
tumble to pieces. Here lies our great danger, and I 
almost tremble when I think of this rock. Nothing but 
disunion can hurt our cause. This will ruin it, if great 
prudence, temper, and moderation are not mixed in 
our counsels, and made the governing principles of the 
contending parties. When, my good Sir, will you be 
with me ? I fear I shall have a difficult card to play in 
this government [New York], and could wish for your 
assistance and advice to manage it. I have not time to 
add more, except that with great sincerity and truth I 
am, dear Sir, your most obedient and affectionate hum- 
ble servant. 



TO THE committee OF SAFETY OF NEW YORK. 

Head-Quarters, 17 April, 1776. 

Gentlemen, 
There is~ nothing that could add more to my happi- 
ness, than to go hand in hand with the civil authority of 
this, or any other government, to which it may be my 
lot to be ordered ; and, if in the prosecution of such 
measures as shall appear to me to have a manifest ten-

dency to promote the interest of the great American 
cause, I shall encounter the local convenience of indi- 
viduals, or even of a whole colony, I beg it may be be- 
lieved, that I shall do it with reluctance and pain ; but, 
in the present important contest, the least of two evils 
must be prel'erred. That a continuance of the inter- 
course, which has hitherto subsisted between the in- 
habitants of this colony and the enemy on board their 
ships of war, is injurious to the common cause, requires 
no extraordinary abilities to prove. A moment's reflec- 
tion not only evinces this truth, but points out the glar- 
ing absurdity of such a procedure. We are to consider 
ourselves either in a state of peace or of war Avith Great 
Britain. If the former, why are our ports shut up, our 
trade destroyed, our property seized, our towns burnt, 
and our worthy and valuable citizens led into captivity, 
and suffering the most cruel hardships ? If the latter, 
my imagination is not fertile enough to suggest a reason 
in support of the intercourse. 

In the weak and defenceless state, in which this city 
was some time ago, political prudence might justify the 
correspondence, which subsisted between the country 
and the enemy's ships of war ; but, as the largest part 
of the Continental troops is now here ; as many strong 
works are erected and erecting for the defence of the 
city and harbour, those motives no longer exist, but are 
absorbed in others of a more important nature. To tell 
you, Gendemen, that the advantages of an intercourse 
of this kind are altogether on the side of the enemy, 
whilst we derive not the smallest benefit from it, would 
be telling what must be obvious to every one. It is, 
indeed, so glaring, that even the enemy themselves must 
despise us for suffering it to be continued ; for, besides 
their obtaining supplies of every kind, by which they 
are enabled to continue in your harbours, it also opens 



PaktII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 359 

a regular channel of intelligence, by which they are, 
from time to time, made acquainted ^\ith the number 
and extent of our works, our strength, and all our 
movements ; by which they are enabled to regulate 
their own plans, to our great disadvantage and injury. 
For the truth of this, I could produce instances ; but, as 
it may be the subject of future discussion, I decline it at 
present. 

It would. Gentlemen, be taking up too much of your 
time, to use further arguments in proof of the necessity 
of putting an immediate and total stop to all further cor- 
respondence with the enemy. It is my incumbent duty 
to eft'ect this, convinced as I am of the disadvantages 
resulting from it ; and it cannot be thought strange or 
hard, that, under such conviction, I should be anxious 
to remove an evil, which may contribute, not a litde, to 
the ruin of the great cause we are engaged in, and may, 
in its effects, prove highly detrimental to this colony in 
particular. 

In effecting the salutary purposes abovementioned, I 
could wish for the concurrence and support of your 
honorable body. It certainly adds great weight to the 
measures adopted, when the civil authority cooperates 
with the military to carry them into execution. It would 
also redound much to the honor of the government, 
and of your Committee in particular ; for the world is 
apt to judge from appearances ; and, while such a cor- 
respondence exists, the reputation of the whole colony 
will suffer in the eyes of their American brethren. It 
is therefore, Gentlemen, that I have taken the liberty to 
address you on this important subject, relying on your 
zeal and attachment to the cause of American liberty, 
for your assistance in putting a stop to this evil, and that 
you will cooperate with me in such measures as shall be 
effectual, either to prevent any future correspondence

a more firm and decided character, than had hitherto been shown either 
by the Committees or the Provincial Congress. In writing to Washington 
on the 25th of April, the Committee say, " The polite sensibility, with

indeed, at first, " a band of undisciplined husbandmen " ;

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. /^ 

New York, 19 April, 1776.

Yours of the 12th instant from Fort George was de- 
livered to me yesterday by express. I agree with you, 
that the intelligence is very alarming and requires the 
strictest attention, t The four regiments ordered from

f When General Wooster left Montreal for Quebec, March 97th, tlie 
command of the former place devolved on Colonel Hazcn, who wrote to 
General Schuyler, on the 1st of April, as follows. 

" You are not unacquainted witli the friendly disposition of the Cana- 
dians, when General Montgomery first penetrated into the country ; the 
ready assistance which they gave on all occasions, by men, carriages, or 
provisions, was most remarkable. Even when he was before Quebec, 
many parishes offered their services in the reduction of that fortress, wliich 
were at that time thought unnecessary. But his most unfortunate fate, 
added to other incidents, has caused such a change in their disposition, 
that we no longer look upon them as friends, but on the contrary waiting 
an opportunity to join our enemies. That no observations of my own may 
remain obscure, I beg leave to observe, that I think the clergy, or guar-

hence are now embarking, and I hope they will soon be 
with you. I need not urge the necessity of forwarding 
them from Albany with all possible despatch. You will 
have with the troops five hundred barrels of provisions. 
The commissary-general expects every moment a large 
quantity from Connecticut, and what can be spared of 
it shall be sent to you in the same bottoms, without de- 
lay. What General Lee contracted for is not yet de- 
livered. Ilis sudden and unexpected departure to the 
southward left the contractors at a loss where to deliver 
the provisions, and apply for the pay. The commissary - 
general has since renewed the contract, and ordered 
them to send the provisions here. I have ordered a 
return to be made of the state of our magazine, and if 



dians of tl)e souls and conductors of the bodies of these enthusiasts, have 
been neglected, perhaps in some instances ill-used. Be that as it will, 
they are unanimous, though privately, against our cause, and I have too 
much reason to fear many of them, ivith otlier people of some conse- 
quence, have carried on a correspondence the whole winter with General 
Carleton in Quebec, and are now plotting our destruction. The peasantry 
in general have been ill-used. They have, in some instances, been dra- 
gooned witli the point of tlie bayonet to supply wood for the garrison at a 
lower rate tlian tlie current price. For carriages and many other articles 
furnished, certificates have been given not legible, without signature, the 
one half of consequence rejected by the quartermaster-general. It is true, 
payment has been promised from time to time ; yet they look upon such 
promises as vague, tlieir labor and property lost, and tlie Congress or United 
Colonies bankrupt. And in a more material point, they have not seen suf- 
ficient force in the country to protect them. These matters furnish very 
strong arguments to be made use of by our enemies. With respect to the 
better sort of people, both French and English, seven eighths are Tories, 
who would wish to see our throats cut, and perhaps would readily assist in 
doing it. 

" You may remember, Sir, in a conversation with you at Albany, I urged 
the necessity of sending immediately to Canada able generals, a respecta- 
ble army, a committee of Congress, a suitable supply of hard casli, and a 
printer. Indeed, I had before represented those measures in person to 
Congress, at least to the Committee of Congress, and we have since been 
flattered from time to time that we should have one or all of these es- 
sentials." — MS. Letter. 



PaktII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 363 

the powder you request can possibly be spared, you 
shall have it. 

I have written to Congress to know whether they 
would incline to send you a further reinforcement of 
men ; but we are yet in a very uncertain situation, not 
knowing where the enemy may bend their force, and 
constant applications are made from all quarters of the 
seacoast for a supply of men and ammunition. The 
recruits, that have been raised here, are totally unfur- 
nished with ai'ms, and, what is still worse, we do not 
know where to procure them. You, who know the 
temper and disposition of the savages, will, I doubt not, 
think with me, that it will be impossible to keep them in 
a state of neutrality. I have urged upon Congress the 
necessity of engaging them on our side, to prevent their 
taking an active part against us, which would be a most 
fatal stroke under our present circumstances. 

The commotions among the Canadians are alarming. 
I am afraid proper measures have not been taken to 
conciliate their affections ; but rather that they have 
been insulted and injured, than which nothing could 
have a greater tendency to ruin our cause in that coun- 
try. For human nature is such, that it will adhere to 
the side from whence the best treatment is received. I 
therefore conjure you. Sir, to recommend to the officers 
and soldiers in the strongest terms to treat all the inhab- 
itants, Canadians, English, and savages, with tenderness 
and respect, paying them punctually for what they re- 
ceive, or giving them such certificates as will enable 
them to receive their pay. As you are perfectly well 
acquainted with the country and its inhabitants in and 
about Albany, I think it would be best for you to remain 
there, at least until the troops and all their supplies are 
forwarded from thence to Canada. Besides the four 
regiments ordered for that service, I shall send a com-

neers. I beg you Avill continue to furnish me with

me, most afiectionately, your obedient humble servant. 



, to the president of coivgress. 

*^ Sir, 

You will please to notice what Colonel Hazen says 
of the disposition of the Indians. * In my opinion, it 
will be impossible to keep them in a state of neutrality. 
They must, and, no doubt, soon will take an active part 
either for or against us ; and I submit it to the consider- 
ation of Congress, whether it would not be best imme- 
diately to engage them on our side, and to use our ut- 
most endeavours to prevent their minds being poisoned 
by ministerial emissaries, w'hich will ever be the case, 
while a King's ganison is suffered to remain in their 
country. Would it not therefore be advisable to send 
a sufficient force from the back counties of Pennsylva- 
nia, to take possession of the garrisons of Niagara and 
Detroit? This, I think, might easily be effected, and 
would answer the most salutary purposes. The Seneca 
Indians, who have hitherto appeared friendly to us, 
might be usefully employed in this business. 

I am in hopes that most of the difficulties mentioned 

* Colonel Hazen had written from Montreal to General Schuyler; — 
" The savages hereabouts are cool ; they keep aloof from us ; we are to 
expect little or no friendship from them, and indeed little or no precaution 
has been taken for that purpose. It is expected by some, that numbers 
wUl come from the interior country, and fall on our frontiers early in the 
spring. The Canadians taking up arms so early against us is of the most 
important consequence. We have ourselves brouglit about by misman- 
agement, what Governor Carleton himself could never effect."

in Colonel Hazen's letter will be obviated by the ap- 
pearance of the respectable committee of Congress 
in Canada, and the forces that have been and will 
be sent there. The security of that country is of 
the utmost importance to us. This cannot be done 
so effectually by conquest, as by taking strong hold 
of the affections and confidence of the inhabitants. 
It is to be lamented, that any conduct of the Continental 
troops should tend to ahenate their affections from us. 
The honorable Congress will be able to judge from the 
papers sent them by General Schuyler, and the infor- 
mation they may receive of the designs of the enemy, 
whether it is expedient to send a further reinforcement 
to Canada. If such should be their determination, I 
stand ready to execute their orders ; and am, with re- 
spect, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.

Sir, 
I have now the pleasure to acquaint you, that the four 
regiments designed for Canada embarked yesterday 
with a fair wind for Albany, under the command of 
Colonels Greaton, Patterson, Bond, and Poor ; besides 
which there was a company of riflemen, a company 
of artificers, and two' engineers, the whole com- 
manded by Brigadier- General Thompson. I have re- 
peatedly mentioned to the honorable Congress the dis- 
tressful situation we are in for want of arms. With 
much pains and difficulty I got most of the regiments 
from the eastward tolerably well furnished ; but I find 
the New York regiments very badly provided. Colo- 
nel Ritzema's has scarcely any ; and yet these men, 

EE 



366 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

being enlisted during the war, and at five dollars per 
month, ought not, in my judgment, to be discharged ; 
as we find it almost as difiicult to get men as arms. 
This is a matter of some importance, which I should be 
glad to receive the particular opinion of Congress upon.* 
Mr. Baldwin is one of the assistant-engineers ordered to 
Canada. He is indeed a very useful man in his depart- 
ment, but he declined the service on account of his pay, 
which he says is inadequate to his support. In order to 
induce him to continue, I promised to represent his case 
to Congress ; and would recommend an increase of his 
pay, and that he should have the rank of heutenant- 
colonel, of which he is very deserving. I beg leave 
therefore to recommend him to the Congress, and that 
they would make provision for him accordingly.! A 
few days ago, application was made to me by the Com- 
mittee of Safety ibr this colony for an exchange of pris- 
oners. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to 
their letter, a copy of which you have, enclosed. As 
there is a standing order of Congress, that no sailors or 
soldiers shall be exchanged for citizens, I did not in- 
cline to comply with the request without the particular 
direction of Congress ; but I have been since informed, 
that the prisoners, mentioned in the Committee's letter 
as citizens, are really seamen taken from private ves- 
sels, but not in arms. How far this may alter the case, 
or how far the reasons which induced the Congress to 
pass the resolve abovementioned may still exist, must 
be left to their determination. 

The militia, who, on my application, were ordered to 
this place to keep possession, until I should arrive with 



* Congress resolved, that no troops should be disbanded for want of 
arms. 

f This recommendation was successful, and Mr. Baldwin was allowed 
the pay and rank of lieutenant-colonel on the Continental establishment. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 



367 



the Continental forces, were obliged to return home 
without their pay, as there was not then money suffi- 
cient in the treasury lor that purpose, and to answer the 
exigencies of the army. This occasioned great uneasi- 
ness among them, and may be attended with very bad 
consequences, in case we should have occasion for their 
service on any future emergency. I therefore beg the 
Congress would make provision for their pay, and point 
out particularly whether it is to be done by the com- 
mander of the Continental forces, or by the Provincial 
Assemblies or Conventions from whence they are sent. 
As the time for which the riflemen enlisted will ex- 
pire on the 1st of July next, and as the loss of such a 
valuable and brave body of men will be of great injury 
to the service, I would submit it to the consideration of 
Congress, whether it would not be best to adopt some 
method to induce them to continue. They are indeed 
a very useful corps ; but I need not mention this, as 
their importance is already well known to the Congress. 
It is necessary they should pay an early attention to this 
matter, as we know from past experience that men are 
very slow in re-enlisting.* When I had the honor of 
seeing Commodore Hopkins at New London, he re- 
presented to me the weak state of his fleet, occasioned 
by sickness and the damage he received in his engage- 
ment with the enemy ; and requested I would spare 
him two hundred men to assist him in a design he had 
formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily consented 
to ; and the men are to be returned as soon as the ser- 



* The companies of riflemen, raised in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and 
Virginia, by order of Congress, were, by the terms of their enlistment, to 
serve one year, nnless sooner discharged. Congress authorized and di- 
rected the officers of these companies, and of independent rifle companies, 
to re-enlist the men, and enlist recruits, for two years' service, liable to be 
sooner discharged upon receiving a month's pay in advance.

to furnish General Lee with the companies of artillery 
he desires. I have already sent two companies to Que-

ceive from Congress some considerable time ago, they 
were pleased to ask what rank aids-de-camp bore in 
•* the army ; from whence I concluded, that they had ad- 

verted to the extraordinary trouble and confinement of 
those gentlemen, with a view to make them an adequate 
allowance. But nothing having been since done or said 
of the matter, I take the liberty, unsolicited by, and un- 
known to my aids-de-camp, to inform your honorable 
body, that their pay is not by any means equal to their 
trouble and confinement. No person wishes more to 
save money to the public, than I do ; and no person has 
aimed more at it. But there are some cases in which 
parsimony may be ill-placed ; and this I take to be one. 
Aids-de-camp are persons in whom entire confidence 
must be placed ; it requires men of abilities to execute 
the duties with propriety and despatch, where there is 
such a multiplicity of business, as must attend the Com-

mander-in-chief of such an army as ours ; and per- 
suaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of those gentle- 
men, who live with me and act in this capacity, for the 
great American cause, and personal attachment to me, 
have induced them to undergo the trouble and confine- 
ment they have experienced, since they have become 
members of my family. 

I give in to no kind of amusements myself; and con- 
sequently those about me can have none, but are con- 
fined from morning fill evening, hearing and answering 
the applications and letters of one and another, which 
will now, I expect, receive a considerable addition, as 
the business of the northern and eastern departments, 
if I continue here, must, I suppose, pass through my 
hands. If these gentlemen had the same relaxation 
from duty as other officers have in their common rou- 
tine, there would not be so much in it. But, to have 
the mind always upon the stretch, scarce ever unbent, 
and no hours for recreation, makes a material odds. 
Knowing this, and at the same time how inadequate the 
pay is, I can scarce find inclination to impose the ne- 
cessary duties of their office upon them. To what I 
have here said, this further remark may be added, and it 
is a matter of no small concernment to me, and, in its 
consequences, to the public, namely, that, while the 
duty is hard and the pay small, it is not to be wondered 
at, if there should be found a promptness in them to 
seek preferment, or in me to do justice to them by facil- 
itating their views ; by which means I must lose their 
aid, when they have it most in their power to assist me. 
Influenced by these motives, I have taken the liberty of 
laying the matter before your honorable body, not 
doubting its meeting with a patient hearing. I am, &.c. *

•'^Z- I^oiS I have not yet heard, that there has been any trial of 

hi\(ry (a the prizes carried into Massachusetts Bay. This pro- 

crastination is attended with very bad consequences. 
Some of the vessels I had fitted out are now laid up, 
the crews being dissatisfied that they cannot get their 
prize-money. I have tired the Congress upon this sub- 
ject ; but the importance of it makes me again mention, 
that, if a summary way of proceeding is not resolved on, 
it will be impossible to get our vessels manned. I must 
also mention to you, Sir, that Captain Manly and his 
crew are desirous to know when they may expect their 
part of the value of the ordnance stores taken last fall. 
They are anxious to know what the amount may be. 
As the inventory of that cargo is in the hands of Con- 
gress, I would humbly submit it to them, whether a val- 
uation thereof should not be made, and the captors' 
dividend be remitted to them as soon as possible. It 
will give them spirit, and encourage them to be alert in 
looking out for other prizes. 

Several officers belonging to the regiments raised in 
these middle colonies inform me, that their men, not- 
withstanding their agreement, begin to murmur at the 
distinction of pay made between them and the regi- 
ments from the eastward. I should be glad that the 
Congress would attend to this in time, lest it may get to 
such a pitch as will make it ditiicult to suppress. They 
argue that they perform the same duty, undergo the 
same fatigue, and receive five dollars, when the eastern 

fixed at thirty-throe dollars a month. In conseqnencc of this letter, it was 
raised to forty dollars. The rank was that of lieutenant-colonel. The 
aids-de-camp of major-generals ranked as majors.

regiments receive six dollars and two thirds per month. 
For my own part, I wish they were all upon the same 
footing ; for, if the British army will not face this way, 
it will be necessary to detach a great part of our troops. 
In that case, I should, for many reasons, be sorry there 
should be any distinctions of regiments, that arc all in 
the pay of the United Colonies. 

April 26th. — I have been honored with your favor of 
the 23d instant. In obedience to the order therein con- 
tained, I have directed six regiments more for Canada, 
which will embark as soon as vessels and other neces- ^Y*^^ *"* 
saries can be provided. These regiments will be com- « 
manded by General Sullivan. I shall give him instruc- ^^^^^*^^^ ^^ 
tions to join the forces in that country under General '^*^ *^ ^^ P^ 
Thomas as soon as possible. With respect to sending ^ ^ ' 
more troops to that country, I am really at a loss what to 
advise, as it is impossible at present to know the designs 
of the enemy.* Should they send the whole force under 
General Howe up the river St. Lawrence, to relieve Que- 
bec and recover Canada, the troops gone and now going 
will be insufficient to stop their progress ; and should 
they think proper to send that or an equal force this way 
from Great Britain, for the purpose of possessing this 
city and securing the navigation of Hudson's River, the 
troops left here will not be sufficient to oppose them ; 
and yet, for any thing we know% I think it not improb- 
able they may attempt both ; both being of the greatest 
importance to them, if they have men. 

I could wish, indeed, that the army in Canada should 
be more powerfully reinforced ; at the same time I am 
conscious, that the trusting of this important post, which

a risk. The securing of this post and Hudson's River 
is to us also of so great importance, that I cannot at 
present advise the sending any more troops from hence; 
on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I 
thought it my duty to consult, think it absolutely neces- 
sary to increase the army at this place with at least ten 
thousand men, especially when it is considered, that, 
from this place only, the army in Canada must draw its 
supplies of ammunition, provisions, and, most probably, 
of men ; and that all reinforcements can be sent from 
hence much easier than from any other place. By the 
enclosed return, you will see the state of the army here, 
and that the number of effective men is far short of 
what the Congress must have expected. * 

I have found it necessary to order Colonel Dayton's 
regiment from New Jersey to march as one of the six to 
Canada ; wherefore I must recommend it to Congress 
to order two companies of one of the regiments still in 
Pennsylvania to march to Cape May, which can be 
done much sooner ; for, had this destination of that regi- 

* By the adjutant-general's return on the 28th of April, tlie number of 
troops present and fit for duty under General Washington's command was 
8,101. Including those, who were sick, absent on furlough, and on com- 
mand, the whole army at New York amounted to 10,93.5. 

From the Onltrli/ Book, June 27th. — "The riotous behaviour of some 
soldiers of the Continental army, yesterday and tlie evening before, has 
filled the General with much regret and concern ; and lays him under the 
disagreeable necessity of declaring, that if the like behaviour should be 
practised again, the authors will be brought to tlie severest punishment, 
if taken, or treated as a common enemy if they dare to resist. Men are 
not to carve out remedies for themselves. If they are injured in any re- 
spect, there are legal modes to obtain relief, and just complaints will always 
be attended to and redressed. It should be tlie pride of a soldier to con- 
duct himself in such a manner, as to obtain the applause and not the re- 
proach of a people he is sent to defend ; and it should be the business as 
it is the duty of an officer to inculcate and enforce this doctrine."

nient to detach two companies from it to that place, as 
the march would, according to Lord Stirling's and other 
accounts, have been at least two hundred miles from 
Amboy, and they must have passed within twenty miles 
of Philadelphia, there being no practicable road along 
the seacoast of New Jersey for their baggage to have 
passed. I have the honor to be, &c. /^i e V- «^ , /^<f^^A^ ^ //(^

New York, 26 April, 1776. . 

Sir, (6 J^f^tKA^'^^^ «'*'-. 

When you did me the honor of a visit at Norwich, on 
my way to this place, I communicated to you the 
recommendation I had received from Congress for 
sending four battalions from hence to reinforce the 
troops in Canada. I now beg leave to inform you, that, 
in compliance therewith, on Saturday and Sunday last, 
I detached four regiments thither, under the command 
of Brigadier- General Thompson; and, by an express 
received last night, I am ordered by Congress, in addi- 
tion to those already gone, to send si.x more immedi- 
diately. ^ Our regiments being incomplete and much 
wanting in numbers, I need not add, that the array here 
felt a sensible diminution by this detachment ; and, 
when the second is gone, it will be weak indeed, con- 
sidering the importance of this place, and the many ex- 
tensive posts, which must be guarded for its defence. 
Added to this, almost the whole of our valuable ord- 
nance, stores, and magazines will be deposited here. 
For these reasons, it appears to me expedient, that 
some mode should be adopted, without loss of time, by 
this government, yours, and that of Jersey, for throwing in

immediate succours, upon the appearance of the enemy, 
or any case of emergency. I have written to the Con- 
gress of New Jersey upon the suhject, praying them 
to form such regulations respecting their militia, they 
being the only resource we have, that assistance may 
be had on the earliest notice of an approach by the en- 
emy, for preventing the alarming and fatal consequences, 
which might result from the common, tedious, and slow 
raethod.s generally used for obtaining their aid. And I 
would take the liberty of mentioning, that, if the same 
should be done by you and your honorable Council, 
respecting yom- militia, or such part of them as are 
nearest to this place, the most salutary ends might 
result therefrom. 

The benefits ilowing from a timely succour being too 
obvious for repetition, I shall, with all possible deference, 
propose for your consideration, whether it would not be 
advisable to have some select corps of men appointed, 
under proper othcers, in the western parts of your gov- 
ernment, to repair to this place on the earliest notice 
from the general, or officer commanding here, of the 
appearance of an enemy. If it should be thought ne- 
cessary upon an emergency, in the first instance to re- 
sort to you, and for all the ordinary forms to be gone 
through, before any succours can be ordered in, it is to 
be feared, that the relief would be too late to answer 
any good purpose. This, however, I shall submit to 
you, in full confidence of your most ready assistance on 
every occasion, and that such measures, as appear to 
you most likely to advance the public good, in this and 
every instance, will be most cheerfully adopted. I am. 
Sir, with great esteem, &c.

TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. 

New York, 21) April, 1770. 

Dear Brotheu, 

Since my arrival al this place, 1 have been favored 
with two or three of your letters, and thank you for 
your kind and frequent remembrance of me. If I should 
not write to you so often as you do to me, you must 
attribute it to its true cause, and that is, the hurry and 
multiplicity of business in which I am constantly en- 
gaged, from the time I rise out of my bed until I go into 
it again. I wrote to you a pretty full account, just be- 
fore I left Cambridge, of the movements of the two ar- 
mies, and now refer you to it. Since that time, I have 
brought the whole army, whicli I had in the New En- 
gland governments (five regiments excepted, left behind 
for the defence of Boston and the stores we have there), 
to this place ; and eight days ago I detaclied four regi- 
ments for Canada ; and I am now embarking six more 
for the same place, as there are reasons to believe, that 
a push will be made there this campaign, and things in 
that country not being in a very promising way, either 
with respect to the Canadians or Indians. These de- 
tachments have w'eakened us very considerably in this 
important post, where, I am sorry to add, there are too 
many inimical persons. But as our affairs in Canada 
can derive no support, except what is sent to them, and 
the militia may be called in here, it was thought best to 
stj-engthen that quarter at the expense of this ; but I am 
afraid we are rather too late in doing it. From the 
eastern army, under my immediate command, it was 
impossible to do it sooner. 

We have already gone great lengths in fortifying this 
city and the Hudson River. A fortnight more will put 
us in a very respectable posture of defence. The

works we have already constructed, and which they 
found we were about to erect, have put the King's ships 
to flight ; for, instead of lying within pistol-shot of the 
wharves, and their sentries conversing with ours, whilst 
they received every necessary that the country afforded, 
they have now gone down to the Hook, near thirty miles 
from this place, the last harbour they can get to, and 
I have prevailed upon the Committee of Safety to for- 
bid every kind of intercourse between the inhabitants 
of this colony and the enemy. This I was resolved 
upon effecting ; but I thought it best to bring it about 
through that channel, as I now can pursue my own 
measures in support of their resolves. 

Mrs. Washington is still here, and talks of taking the 
smallpox ; but I doubt her resolution. Mr. and Mrs. 
Custis will set out in a few days for Maryland. I did 
not write to you by the 'Squire, because his departure, 
in the first place, was sudden ; in the next, I had but 
little to say. I am very sorry to hear, that my sister 
was indisposed when you last wrote. I hope she is 
now recovered, and that your family are well. That 
they may continue so, and that our once happy country 
may escape the depredations and calamities attending 
war, is the fervent prayer of, dear Sir, your most af- 
fectionate brother. 



TO THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY OF NEW YORK. 

Z. J'Vm-O <f fS New York, 30 April, 177C. 

Gentlemen, 
I perceive by the tenor of your favor of yesterday, 
that my letter of the 27th has given umbrage, which I 
am sorry for, as I had not the most distant idea of giving 



Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIOl^. 377 

any.* Three things led me to suspect, that the New 
York battalions were not upon the same estabhsh- 
ment as the other Continental troops ; current report, 
an implied exception in the order for detaching six more 
battalions to Canada, and that part of your letter signi- 
fying that four of these battalions were to be raised 
under your immediate direction ; which intimation, com- 
ing in corroboration of the two first reasons, for I never 
had any information of this matter from Congress, led 
me to believe, that you intended it as a gentle hint, that 
I was not to consider them in the same light as I did 
the others. It was not to be wondered at, therefore, 
that I should wish to know the extent of my authority 
over them, that my conduct might be regulated there- 
by, or that I should not be so solicitous in arming regi- 
ments, raised for local purposes, as those for the general 
service, when the latter are also greatly deficient in this 
essential point. 

These were the ideas, that filled my mind at the time 



* The New York Congress had several months previously to this date 
organized and commenced the raising of four battalions, or regiments, 
commanded by Colonels M'^Dougall, James Clinton, Ritzema, and Wyn- 
koop. In communicating the state of tliese battalions to Washington, it 
was left doubtful by the Committee how far they were to be considered 
under liis command. Whereupon he wrote to them as follows on the 
27th of April; — 

" If the four battalions are placed under the immediate care of the T 
Committee of Safety for this colony by Congress, I should be glad to ' 
know how far it is conceived, that my power over them extends, or 
whether I have any at all. Sure I am that they cannot be subjected to 
the direction of both, and I shall have no small reluctance in assuming 
an authority, which I am not vested with powers to execute. Nor will 
my solicitude (further than as a well-wisher to the cause) on account of 
arms for these regiments, and returns of them, continue, if they are not 
considered as within the line of my command. It becomes, therefore, 
my indispensable duty to ascertain this matter, and to know whether 
these regiments cannot be ordered out of the colony, for instance to New \ 
Jersey, if necessity should require it." 

The Committee replied ; — •" We are sorry to find there was a possibility

of business, which is continually pressing upon me,

that it never was, and I hope never will be, my inten-

yp* , I mean, through you, to do myself the honor of lay- 

' ''^' ^^ ing before Congress a copy of an address transmitted to 

them some time ago by the Assembly of Rhode Island, 

which Governor Cooke favored me v\ith in the month 

of January, at the same time requesting me to interest 



of misumlerstanding the passafre in our Icttor rnspccting tho lour battal- 
ions raising in tliis colony. Be assured. Sir, tliat we never considered 
them as under our direction, except so far as concerned the forniin"; and 
equipping of them ; and if you will be pleased to refer yourself to our last 
letter, tlie distinction taken therein between tlie four battalions and Van 
Schaick's regiment will convince you, that wo meant notPiing more than 
in obedience to Congress to have the complctnig of them for the com- 
mand of tlie Continental General ; nor do we esteem them so pointedly 
under our direction in this respect, as to exclude your solicitude as Com- 
mander-in-chief to have them speedily completed and armed ; a solicitude 
liifhly becoming your station, and ivhich, instead of atibrding Uie least 
o-round for umbrage, serves to heighten the opinion, which your former 
conduct has invariably taught us to entertain of your vigUant attention 
to tlie important duties of your otfice, and of your zeal for the defence 
and security of the rights of this much injured country." 

Van Schaick's regiment was distinct from the above four, and was 
raising in the north part of tlie colony with direct reference to tlie Canada 
service, and in General Schuyler's department.

myself in procurini]; a body of forces on the Continental 
establishment, for the defence of that colony. 1 doubt 
not but the address and the subject of it have had the 
attention and consideration of Congress before now. 
But if they have, not decided upon the matter, I would 
beg leave to mention, that I have made inquiry into the 
situation and condition of the colony, and tind it to be 
as stated in the address ; and, with all deference to the 
opinion of Congress, I conceive it highly necessary and 
expedient, that they should adopt some measures for 
relieving their distress, and granting the aid prayed for. 
The importance of Rhode Island in the chain of the 
union, its extensive seacoast, affording harbours for our 
shipping and vessels, at the same time exposing and 
subjecting the inhabitants to the ravages and depreda- a - ^Os 

tions of our enemies, the zeal and attachment which n^j^,;^^^,-^ //^ f/v.-. 
they have shown, and which still actuate them towards ^ ^^ ^ ^ Cla^ 
the common cause, their incapacity to pay a sufficient '^ ^^ H,^ tu 
number of men for their defence, should they be able ' 
to furnish them after so many engaged in other services ; 
these, and many other reasons, which are too obvious to 
be mentioned, plead powerfully for the notice and atten- 
tion of Congress, and seem to me to claim iheir support. 
Having thus stated the matter to Congress, for their 
consideration, agreeably to my promise to Governor 
Cooke when I had the honor of seeing him on my 
way hither, I shall leave it with them, not doubting but 
they will duly weigh its importance, and give such as- 
sistance as they may think reasonable and just. What 
they chiefly wish for is, that the troops they have raised 
may be taken into Continental pay, and commanding 
officers appointed by Congress. * I have the honor, &c. 

* Congress assented to this request, and resolved on the 11th of May, 
that the two battalions, directed to be raised by the Rhode Island Assem- 
bly, should be taken into Continental pay.

Having had several complaints from the officers in the 
eastern regiments, who have been and are engaged in 
recruiting, about the expense attending it, and for which 
they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the 
officers in these governments have, as I am informed, I 
shall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten 
shillings, granted to the officers for every man enlisted, 
by the I'esolve of Congress, is general and indiscrimi- 
nate, or confined to the middle districts. If general, must 
I have a retrospect to the time of the resolve, and pay 
for the services since, or only for future enlistments ? * 

By a letter from General Schuyler, of the 27th ulti- 
mo, I find General Thompson and his brigade were at 
Albany ; General Sullivan with the last except three or 
four companies of Colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet 
come, is embarked and gone, and probably will be soon 
there. I am apprehensive, from General Schuyler's 
account, that they will not proceed with the wished-for 
expedition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and 
provender for catde necessary to carry their baggage, 
and a scarcity of batteaux at the Lakes for so large a 
number, though he is taking the utmost pains to pro- 
cure them. Should they be stopped for any time, 
it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from 
hence has weakened us here much, and our army in 
Canada will not be strengthened.

that the general be directed to make that allowance for all the troops en- 
listed since passing the said resolution."

I have enclosed to you a return of the last brigade de- 
tached, and also of the forces remaining here. And as 
it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of 
our strength from time to time, and to see it at one 
view, for regulating our movements with propriety, I 
wish it were a direction from Congress to the command- 
ina: officers in the different districts to make monthly 
returns to the Commander-in-chief of the Continental 
army, of the state of the troops in their departments, and 
also of the military stores. Such direction will proba- 
bly make them more attentive than they otherwise 
would be. I could not get a return of the army in 
Canada all last year.* 

I cannot, by all the inquiries I have been able to 
make, learn what number of arms have been taken from 
the Tories, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. 
The Committee of Safety for this colony have assured 
me, that no exertions of theirs shall be wanting to pro- 
cure arms ; but our sufferings in the mean while may 
prove fatal, as men without arms are in a manner use- 
less. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent, 
whose sole business it shall be to ride through the 
middle and interior parts of these governments, for the 
purpose of buying up such arms, as the inhabitants may 
incline to sell, and are fit for use. The designs of the 
enemy are too much behind the curtain for me to form 
any accurate opinion of their plan of operations for the 
summer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore 
in the field of conjecture ; and, as no place, all its conse- 
quences considered, seemed of more importance in the 
execution of their grand plan, than the possession of Hud- 
son's River, I thought it advisable to remove with the

I am glad that you have given your attention to the 
works, which I doubt not by this time are completed. 
It will give me pleasure to hear they are ; for should 
these accounts of Hessians and Hanoverian troops com- 
ing over prove true, it is possible the enemy may make 
some attempts to regain a footing in your province. 
The account you give of the vessels at Beverly being 
unfit for service surprises me prodigiously. I was 
taught to believe very diflferently of the ship Jenny, by 
Commodore Manly and Captain Bartlett, who you men- 
tion have given you their opinion of them. The brig- 
antine from Antigua was also thought very fit to be 
armed. A letter is just come to my hands from Win- 
throp Sargent, agent for the navy at Gloucester. He 
says there are some women and children, whom he is 
obliged to maintain at the Continental expense ; also a 
number of men taken in some of the last prizes. You 
will please to examine into their situation. If prisoners 
of war, they should be sent into some inland place 
and confined. If Tories, the General Court is the 
proper power to take cognizance of them. I have had 
no advice from Congress relative to your resignation.

Dear Sir, 

The uncertainty of my return, and the justice of 
surrendering to Mr. Custis the bonds, wiiich I have 
taken for the moneys raised from his estate, and lent out 
upon interest, as also his moiety of his deceased sister's 
fortune, consisting altogether of bonds, obhge me to 
have recourse to a friend to see this matter done, and a 
proper memorandum of the transaction made. I could 
think of no one, in whose friendship, care, and abilities 
I could so much confide, to do Mr. Custis and me this 
favor, as yourself; and, therefore, I take the liberty of 
soliciting your aid. 

In order that you may be enabled to do this with ease 
and propriety, I have WTitten to the clerk of the Secre- 
tary's office for attested copies of my last settled ac- 
counts with the General Court in behalf of Mr. Custis, 
and the estate of his deceased sister; with which and 
the bonds, I have desired him and Mr. Washington to 
wait upon you for the purpose above mentioned. The 
amount of the balance due, upon my last settled ac- 
counts, to Mr. Custis, I would also have assigned him 
out of my moiety of his sister's bonds ; and, if there is 
no weight in what I have said in my letter to Mr. Lund 
Washington, concerning the rise of exchange, and 
which, to avoid repetition, as I am a good deal hurried, 
I have desired him to show you, I wish it may meet

with no notice, as I want nothing but what is consistent 
with the strictest justice, honor, and even generosity ; 
although I have never charged him or his sister, from 
the day of my connexion with them to this hour, one 
farthing for all the trouble I have had in managing their 
estates, nor for any expense they have been to me, not- 
withstanding some hundreds of pounds would not re- 
imburse the moneys I have actually paid in attending the 
pubhc meetings in Williamsburg to collect their debts, 
and transact the several matters appertaining to the 
respecuve estates. A variety of occurrences, and my 
anxiety to put this place as speedily as possible into a 
posture of defence, will not, at this time, admit of my 
adding more, than that I am, with unfeigned regard.

TO LUND WASHINGTON, MOUNT VERNON. 

New York, 10 May, 1776. 

Dear Lund, 

As I am not able to form any idea of the time of my 
return, and as it is very reasonable and just, that Mr. 
Custis should be possessed of his estate, although it is 
not in my power, circumstanced as I am at present, to 
hquidate the accounts and make a final settlement with 
him, I have written to the clerk of the Secretary's office 
for authenticated copies of the last accounts, which I 
exhibited against him and the estate of his deceased 
sister. With these and the bundle of bonds, which 
you will find among my papers, I would have Mr. Custis 
and you repair to Colonel Mason and get him, as a com- 
mon friend to us both, as a gentleman well acquainted 
with business, and very capable of drawing up a proper 
memorandum of the transaction, to deliver him his own 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 385 

bonds, which, it" my memory fails me not, and no chan- 
ges have happened, are in one parcel and endorsed ; 
and at the same time deliver to him as many bonds out 
of the other parcel, endorsed as Miss Custis's bonds, as 
■nill pay him his moiety of her fortune and the balance, 
which will appear due to him from me, at my last settle- 
ment with the General Court. How the account will 
then stand between us, I cannot with precision say, but 
I believe the balance will be rather in my favor than his 
In my last setdement of the estate of Miss Custis, 
all the bonds and mortgages were fully accounted for, 
and this will be the best ground upon which to found the 
dividend between Mr. Custis and myself, lest any of the 
bonds or mortgages should be misplaced, or in the 
office. Mr. Mercer's bonds I have promised to take 
into my part ; and, as there are wheat and other ac- 
counts opened between that estate and me, I should be 
glad to have them allotted accordingly. In like manner, 
I promised to take Mr. Robert Adams's debt upon my- 
self, and beUeve the last mortgage from him was taken 
in my own name. As to the others, I do not care how 
they are divided, nor was I anxious about these, further 
than it served to comply with their desires, founded I 
believe on an opinion, that I should not press them for 
the money. The bank stock must, I presume, be equal- 
ly divided between us. Long before I left Virginia, I 
directed it to be sold, writing to Messrs. Gary and Com- 
pany, who had always received the dividends, to nego- 
tiate the matter ; in consequence, they sent me a power 
of attorney, and a great deal of formal stuff for Mrs. 
Washington and myself to execute before the governor. 
This we did, Uterally as required, and transmitted ; since 
which, the directors of the bank have prescribed another 
mode, and there has been forwarded to me another set 
of papers, to be executed also before the governor,

which it has never been in my power to do, as they 
arrived but a little while before I set out for the Con- 
gress last spring. Thus the matter stands, as far as I 
know, with respect to the money in the funds. 

There is another matter, which I think justice to 
myself requires to be mentioned, and that is, with 
respect to the sterling balance, which it will appear I 
was owing to Mr. Custis upon the last setdement. It 
was then, and ever since has been, my intention to as- 
sign to him as many bonds, carrying interest, as would 
discharge this balance ; but my attendance upon Con- 
gress in the fall of 1774, and spring of 1775, put it out 
of my power to attend the General Court at their ses- 
sions ; consequently no order could be taken, or account 
rendered, of this matter ; and now, by the rise of ex- 
change, if I were to turn current money bonds into 
steiling, I should be a considerable sufferer, when I had 
not, nor could have, any interest in delaying it ; and that 
it was so delayed was owing to the reasons abovemen- 
tioned, it being a practice to let out his money upon 
interest as soon as it came to my hands. The many 
matters, which hang heavy upon my hands at present, 
do not allow me to add more, but oblige me to request, 
as I have not written fully to Colonel Mason on this sub- 
ject, that you will show him this letter, and if necessary 
let him have it. I am, very sincerely, &c.

this subject, when I first engaged in the service, and 
which I conceived to be superseded by a subsequent 
resolve for forming the army upon the present establish- 
ment, I must have employed one clerk for no other 
business than issuing warrants of appointment, and 
giving information to Congress for their confirmation or 
refusal. It being evident from the necessity of the 
thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies 
in office, from death and a variety of other causes, I 
now submit it to them, and pray their direction, whether 
I am to pursue that mode, and all the ceremonies attend- 
ing it, or to be at the liberty to fill up and grant com- 
missions at once to such, as may be fit and proper per- 
sons to succeed, without these previous steps. With 
the utmost deference and respect, I would beg leave to 
remind Congress of my former letters and apphcations, 
respecting the appointment of proper persons to super- 
intend and take direction of such prisoners, as have 
already fallen and will fall into our hands in the course 
of the war, being fully convinced, that, if there were 
persons appointed, who would take the whole manage- 
ment of them under their care, the continent would 
save a considerable sum of money by it, and the prison- 
ers be better treated and provided with real necessaries, 
than they now are ; and I shall take the liberty to add, 
that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and 
worthy of consideration, that particular and proper 
places of security should be fixed on and established in 
the interior parts of the difTerent governments for their 
reception. 

Such establishments are agreeable to the practice and

usage of the English and other nations, and are founded 
on principles of necessity and public utility. The ad- 
vantages, which will arise from them, are obvious and 
many. I shall mention only two or three. They will 
tend much to prevent escapes, which are difhcult to 
effect, when the public is once advertised, that the 
prisoners are restrained to a few stated and well-known 
places, and not permitted to go from thence ; and the 
more ingenious among them from disseminating and 
spreading their artful and pernicious intrigues and opin- 
ions throughout the country, which would influence the 
weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with 
but too favorable a hearing. Further, it will be less in 
their power to join and assist our enemies in cases of 
invasion, and will give us an opportunity always to know, 
from the returns of those appointed to superintend them, 
Avhat number we have in possession, the force sufficient 
to check and suppress their hostile views in times of 
emergency, and the expenses necessary for their main- 
tenance. Many other reasons might be adduced to prove 
the necessity and expediency of the measure. I shall 
subjoin only one more, which is, that many of the towns, 
where prisoners have been already sent, not having con- 
veniences for or the means of keeping them, complain 
that they are burdensome ; and have become careless, in- 
attentive, and altogether indifferent whether they escape 
or not ; and those of them that are restricted to a closer 
confinement, the hmits of a jail, ai-e neglected, and not 
treated with that care and regard, which Congress Avish. 
I have not received further intelligence of the Ger- 
man troops* since my letter of the 7th instant, covering 
Mr. Cushing's despatches. But, lest the account of 



* German troops said to be coming from Europe to reinforce the British 
army in America. Intelligence to this effect had been communicated by 
Mr. Gushing. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 389 

their coming should be true, may it not be advisable 
and good policy to raise some companies of our Ger- 
mans to send among them when they arrive, lor exciting 
a spirit of disaffection and desertion ? If a few sensi- 
ble and trusty fellows could get with them, I should 
think they would have great weight and influence with 
the common soldiery, who certainly have no enmity 
towards us, having received no injury or cause of 
quarrel from us. The measure having occurred, and 
appearing to me expedient, I thought it prudent to men- 
tion it for the consideration of Congress. Having re- 
ceived a letter from General Ward, advising that Con- 
gress have accepted his resignation, and praying to be 
relieved, and it being necessary that a general officer 
should be sent to take the command of the troops at 
Boston, especially if the army should arrive, which is 
talked of, and which some consider as a probable event, 
I must beg leave to recommend to Congress the ap- 
pointment of some brigadier-generals, not having more 
here, but fewer at this time than are essential to the 
government of the forces, and the conducting of the 
works, that are cai-rying on. Generals Sullivan and 
Thompson being ordered to Canada, I cannot spare one 
more general officer from hence without injuring the 
service greatly, and leaving the army here without a 
sufficient number.* Having frequent applications from 
the Committee of Safety and others, about an exchange 
of prisoners, and not having authority to pursue any 
other mode in this instance, than that marked out by a 
resolve of Congress some time ago, I hope they will 

*X;onjrress accepted the resignation of Major-General Ward and 
Brigadier-General Frye, on the 23d of April ; and it was resolved, in 
compliance with the above request, on the 14th of May, that General Wash- 
ington should order a major-general to take command in the eastern de- 
partment, and also send a brigadier on that service.

jyi/f Dear Sir, 

The letter from the Commissioners, which you were 

kind enough to leave open for my perusal, describes 

matters and the situation of our affairs in Canada, in so 

striking a light, that nothing less than the most wise and

^ * Three Commissioners, Franklin, Chase, and Carroll, were appointed 

by Congress, February 15th, to repair to Canada. By their instructions 
they were to use all suitable means to induce the Canadians to join the 
other colonies in the contest against England ; to promise them the same 
privileges of an independent government, and the same protection, that 
were enjoyed by each of the otlier colonies ; to convince them, that they 
■were equally interested in the common cause, and woidd profit equally by 
the advantages of success ; and to assure them that free toleration should 
be allowed in religion, that the terms of union should be similar to those 
binding together the other colonies, and that, in case they should join the 
union, these colonies would protect them against all enemies. The Com- 
missioners were also empowered to establish a printing-press, to settle 
differences between the inhabitants and tlie troops, to reform abuses in the 
army, to establish regulations for preserving peace and good order, and, in 
effecting these objects, to suspend any civil or military officer, till the 
pleasure of the Congress should be known. Armed with these extensive 
powers, the Commissioners arrived at Montreal on the 29th of April. 
They were accompanied by the Reverend John Carroll, a Catholic clergy- 
man, afterwards archbishop of Baltimore, whose influence with the people 
it was thought would be useful, on account of his religious principles and 
character. But they found the state of affairs in Canada by no means

work. However, I hope all things \\ ill yet go well. I am 
exceedingly glad that so large a number of Indians was 
present at the review of General Sullivan's brigade. 
They probably, i'rom the appearance of so many armed 
men somewhat instructed in discipline, may have re- 
ceived favorable impressions of our strength, sufficient 
to counteract the ingenious and insidious arts of Tory- 
ism. When those arrive, whom you mention, I shall 
take proper notice of them, and have necessary pro- 
visions made for their entertainment. I am. Sir, &c. 



TO A COMMITTEE ON LONG ISLAND. 

New York, 16 May, 1776. 

Gentlemen, 
Your favor of the 1 4th, with an account of the ap- 
prehending of sundry Tories by order of your com- 
mittee, and the taking of others by Captain Harden, is 
now before me. Your zeal and activity upon this occa- ^ V^ 

sion are truly commendable, and with great pleasure I 
will lend any aid in my power, that shall be thought 
within the line of my department, to root out or secure 
such abominable pests of society. But as you have 
neither pointed out the names nor the places of abode 
of the persons alluded to by your informants, I must 
beg the favor of a more explicit description from you ; 

such, as to encourage any just hope of success to their mission. Negli- 
gence, mismanagement, and a combination of unlucky incidents, had 
produced a confusion and disorder, that it was now too late to remedy. 
Tlie Commissioners used every effort in their power, but to little effect. 
Ill health caused Dr. Franklin to return in a few days. His two associates 
remained till after the American forces had retreated to Sorel, and were 
preparing to evacuate Canada.

signs, which you think are in agitation. I shall add no 
more at present, than that I am, &,c.*

Sir, 
This will be delivered you by General Gates, who 
sets out to-day for Congress agreeably to my letter of 
yesterday. I have committed to him the heads of sun- 
dry matters to lay before Congress for their considera- 
tion, which, from the interesting intelligence contained 
in my last, appear to me of the utmost importance, and 
to demand their most early and serious attention. Sen- 
sible that I have omitted to set down many things 
necessary, and which probably, when deliberating, they 
will wish to be acquainted with ; and not conceiving 
myself at liberty to depart from my post, though to 
attend them, without their previous approbation ; I have 
requested General Gates to subjoin such hints of his 
own, as he may apprehend material. His military ex- 
perience, and intimate acquaintance with the situation 
of our affairs, will enable him to give Congress the full- 
est satisi'action about the measures necessary to be 
adopted at this alarming crisis ; and, with his zeal and 
attachment to the cause of America, he will have a claim 
to their notice and favors. When Congress shall have 
come to a determination on the subject of this letter.

Sir, 

Your favor of the 16th, with several resolutions of 
Congress therein enclosed, I had not the honor to re- 
ceive till last night. Before the receipt of it, I did not 
think myself at liberty to wait on Congress, although I 
wished to do it ; and therefore I the more readily con- 
sented to General Gates's attendance, as I knew there 
were many rhatters, which could be better explained in 
a personal interview, than by whole volumes of letters. 
He accordingly set out for Philadelphia yesterday morn- 
ing, and must be too far advanced on his journey (as he 
proposed expedition) to be overtaken. 

I shall, if I can settle some matters, which are in 
agitation with the Provincial Congress here, follow to- 
morrow or next day ; and, therefore, with every sentiment 
of regard, attachment, and gratitude to Congress for 
their kind attention to the means, which they think may 
be conducive to my health, and with particular thanks

of 

" New York, 21 May, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

I have enclosed for your perusal copies of two in- 
formations, and a letter I received on Saturday last from 
the Committee of King's district by the hands of Martin 
Bebee, who says he is their clerk, and was sent ex- 
press. From these you will readily discover the dia- 
bolical and insidious arts and schemes carrying on by 
the Tories, and friends of government, to raise distrust, 
dissensions, and divisions among us. Having the utmost 
confidence in your integrity, and the most incontestable 
proof of your great attachment to our common country 
and its interest, I could not but look upon the charge 
against you with an eye of disbelief, and sentiments of 
detestation and abhorrence ; nor should I have troubled 
you with the matter, had I not been informed, that 
copies were sent to different committees and to Gover- 
nor Trumbull, which I conceived would get abroad, and 
that you, should you find that I had been furnished with 
them, would consider my suppressing them as an evi- 
dence of my behef, or at best of my doubts, of the 
charges. 

The confidence and assurance I have of the injustice 
and infamy of the charges against the Convention obliged 
me, also, to lay the matter before them ; lest my not do- 
ing it should be construed by them into a distrust of their 
zeal, and promote the views of the Tories ; who, to ex- 
cite disorder and confusion, judge it essential to involve 
those in high departments in a share of the plot, which 
is not unlikely to be true in some parts, as I believe that 

Fourth Street. If this should be agreeable to you, it will afford me much 
pleasure."

our internal enemies have many projects in contempla- 
tion to subvert our liberties.* Before I conclude, I 
would mention, that some officers called upon me a few 
days ago, having your permit to go to Pennsylvania and 
settle some aftairs there. This hcense, when there is 
really business, is certainly countenanced by humanity 
and generosity ; but, nevertheless, it should not be in- 
dulged, and I hope will not be granted in future, as it 
gives them an opportunity of getting intelligence of all 
our operations, of forming opinions of our strength and 
the places proper for attack, and setUing a channel of cor- 
respondence with the disaffected, by which our ene- 
mies may and will be furnished with full accounts of our 
designs, and every thing that can promote their service 
and injure ours. There is but little reason to believe, 
nay, we are certain, that they will not conduct them- 
selves upon principles of the strictest honor for the 
favors done them, but will, when in their power, exercise 
every device, that can operate to our prejudice.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM, f 

Instructions. 

Sir, 
I have reason to believe, that the Provincial Congress 
of this colony have in contemplation a scheme for seiz- 
ing the principal Tories and disaffected persons on 
Long Island, in this city, and the country round about ; 

* See Appendix, No. XV. 

f As the oldest major-general in the army at New York, General Put- 
nam was left in command during Washington's absence at the call of 
Congress.

and that, to carry the scheme into execution, they will 
have recourse to the mihtary power for assistance. If 
this should be the case, you are hereby required 
during my absence to afford every aid, which the said 
Congress or their Secret Committee shall apply for. I 
need not recommend secrecy to you, as the success, you 
must be assured, will depend absolutely upon precaution, 
and the despatch with which the measure, when once 
adopted, shall be executed. 

General Greene will, though not in person perhaps, 
have a principal share in ordering the detachments from 
his brigade on Long Island ; of course he will be a 
proper person to be let into the whole plan. I would, 
therefore, when application is made by Congress, have 
you and him concert measures with such gendemen, as 
that body shall please to appoint, and order the execu- 
tion with as much secrecy and despatch as possible, 
and at the same time with the utmost decency and good 
order. Given under my hand at Head-Quarters, in the 
city of New York, this 21st day of May, 1776.* 



* The machinations of disaffected persons, or Tories, as they began 
universally to be called, in the lower counties of New York, had for some 
time excited serious apprehensions, as to their effects on the army, and 
particularly when the British forces should arrive on the coast. Governor 
Tryon was at the head of this party, and by his talents, his former populari- 
ty in the province, and his emissaries among the people, he was maturing 
designs, which it was found necessary to take speedy and efficient meas- 
ures to counteract. The Provincial Congress had appointed a secret 
committee of their number to confer with General Washington, from time 
to time, on all such matters as required the cooperation of the civil and 
military powers for the common safety. The subject of the Tories had 
occupied their deliberations, and it was agreed that a strong and decided 
course ouglit immediately to be pursued in regard to them. General 
Washington had promised military aid for carrying into effect any re- 
solves, which might be adopted to attain this object. The following is an 
extract from the proceedings of the Congress on the 19th of May. 

" Mr. Morris, from tlie committee who conferred witli General Wash- 
ington, informed the Congress, that sundry matters of great importance

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. ^ 

Aniboy, '^i May, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

Congress having been pleased to request my atten- 
dance at Pliiladelphia, to advise with them on the situa- 
tion of our atlairs, and of such measures as may be OT^i- 
necessary to adopt for this campaign, I had got thus far 
on my journey, when I stopped to view the ground, and 
such places on Staten Island contiguous to it, as may 
be proper for works of defence. At this place your 
favor of the 16th instant, with its several enclosures, 
came to hand. I am exceedingly concerned for the 
distress of our troops in Canada, and, as I informed you 
heretofore, have been very importunate with the com- 
missary to forward all the provisions in his power ; in 
consequence of which he has sent a good deal on, and 
I shall again repeat my orders and enjoin him to con- 
tinue his supplies as largely and expeditiously as possi- 

had come before the committee and the General ; that the General wished 
for the advice and assistance of this Congress to carry into execution his 
own powers, if not also the assistance of the powers of this Congress ; 
that the matters conferred on are of such importance, that, in order to 
preserve secrecy, it is necessary that eacli particular member be sworn not 
to reveal to any person out of the Congress the matters to be mentioned, 
or tlie subjects of tliis day's debate. The President then put tlie question, 
whether every member is willing to take an oatli of secrecy, and the same 
was unanimously agreed to. 

" Ordered, that Mr. Scott and Mr. Morris wait on General Washington 
and inform him, that the Congress have taken an oath of secrecy, and the 
nature thereof, and receive of him such papers as may be necessary to 
communicate to this Congress. 

" Messrs. Scott and Morris returned from General Washington, and 
delivered to the President such papers as they had received of tlie Gene- 
ral. They reported that a scheme of a junction is forming between the 
disaffected in Connecticut and on Long Island, in order to join the 
ministerial army, and oppress the friends of liberty in these colonies." 

After furtlier consideration the Congress passed a series of resolutions,

ble. Our situation respecting the Indians is delicate 
and embarrassing. They are attached to Johnson, who 
is our enemy. Policy and prudence on the one hand 
suggest the necessity of seizing him and every friend 
of the government ; on the other, if he is apprehended, 
there will be danger of incurring their resentment. I 
hope the Committee will conduct the matter in the least 
exceptionable manner, and in the way that shall most 
advance the public good. 

I observe by the minutes of a council of war, by 
General Thomas's letter, and that of Messrs. Carroll and 
Chase to Dr. Franklin, that our troops cannot make a 
t .i e A' 9-i/\^ rf^tx/^ stand at Dechambeau, as I had hoped. I wish it were 
practicable ; for most certainly the lower down the river 
we can maintain our post, the more important will the 
advantages resulting from it be. Considering all the 
country below us as lost, and that there may be some 
prospect of gaining that above, from whence we might 
draw supplies in some degree, and have the friendship 

setting fortli the unjustifiable acts of disaffected persons, tlie dangers 
threatened by them to the liberties of the country, and the necessity of 
seizing and securing all such, as manifested hostile intentions, and an 
open resistance to the newly established civil authority. The committee 
appointed to execute these resolves, of whom Gouvemeur Morris was 
chairman, were instructed to proceed with vigilance and firmness, to em- 
ploy the militia where occasion required, and if necessary to solicit addi- 
tional force from General Washington. The names of several persons, 
residing in King's, Queen's, New York, Richmond, and Westchester 
counties, had been reported to the Congress, concerning whom the com- 
mittee were required to collect evidence, and examine them in person, 
as well as to send out agents to search for others %vho were concealed or 
unknown. The committee were directed to commit to safe custody such 
persons, as they should think proper, and to send them for this purpose 
into the neighbouring colonies, where tlie infection of tlieir influence could 
not be diffused. A similar course of proceeding was recommended to 
the county committees. Several Tories from New York were, in con- 
sequence of these resolves and others of a similar character, confined in 
the prisons of Connecticut. — MS. Journal of the JVetv York Provincial

and assistance of the inhabitants, it is certain we should 
make a stand as low down as we can, so as not to have 
a retreat cut ofl' in case of necessity, or an opportunity 
of receiving provisions. But unacquainted as 1 am with 
the country, I cannot undertake to say where it should 
be. Not doubting tliat every thing for the best will be 
done, I am, Sir, &lc. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, IN CANADA. 

PhDadelphia, 24 May, 1776. 

Sir, 

I received your favor of the 8th instant with its 
enclosures, confirming the melancholy intelligence I had 
before heard, of your having been obliged to raise the 
siege of Quebec, and to make a precipitate retreat with 
the loss of the cannon in the batteaux, and interception 
of the powder going from General Schuyler. This un- 
fortunate affair has given a sad shock to our schemes in 
that quarter, and blasted the hope we entertained of 
reducing that fortress and the whole of Canada to our 
possession. 

From your representation, things must have been 
found in great disorder, and such as to have made a 
retreat almost inevitable ; but, nevertheless, it is hoped 
you will be able to make a good stand yet, and by that 
means secure a good part or all the upper part of the 
country. That being a matter of the utmost importance 
in the present contest, it is my wish and that of Con- 
gress, that you take an advantageous post as far down 
the river as possible, so as not to preclude you from a 
retreat, if it should be necessary, nor from getting proper 
supplies of provision. The lower down you can main- 
tain a stand, the more advantageous will it be, as all the

country above will most probably take part with us, 
from which we may draw some assistance and support, 
considering all below as entirely Avithin the power

Sir, 
The great variety of business, in which Congress are 
engaged, has prevented our settling what I was re- 
quested to attend for, though we have made several 
attempts, and a committee has been appointed for the 
purpose day after day ; nor can I say with precision 
when I shall be at liberty to return. I must therefore

TO JOHN AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, 31 May, 177(j. 

Dear Brother, 

Since my arrival at this place, where I came at the 
request oi' Congress to settle some matters relative to 
the ensuing campaign, I have received your letter of the 
18th from Williamsburg, and I think I stand indebted 
to you for another, which came to hand some time ago 
in New York. I am very glad to find that the Virginia 
Convention have passed so noble a vote, and with so 
much unanimity. Things have come to such a pass 
now, as to convince us, that we have nothing more to 
expect from the justice of Great Britain ; also, that she 
is capable of the most delusive arts ; for I am satisfied, 
that no commissioners ever were designed, except Hes- 
sians and other foreigners ; and that the idea was only 
to deceive and throw us oil' our guard. The first has 
been too eftectually accomplished, as many members 
of Congress, in short, the representation of whole 
provinces, are still feeding themselves upon the dainty 
food of reconciliation ; and, though they will not allow, 
that the expectation of it has any influence upon their 
judgment, with respect to their preparations for defence, 
it as but too obvious, that it has an operation upon every 
part of their conduct, and is a clog to their proceedings. 
It is not in the nature of things to be otherwise ; for no 
man, that entertains a hope of seeing this dispute 
speedily and equitably adjusted by commissioners, will 
go to the same expense and run the same hazards to 
prepare for the worst event, as he who beheves that he 
must conquer, or submit to unconditional terms, and the 
concomitants, such as confiscation, hanging, and the like. 

To form a new government requires infinite care and 
unbounded attention ; for if the foundation is badly laid, 



404 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 



the superstructure must be bad. Too much time, 
therefore, cannot be bestowed in weighing and digesting 
matters well. We have, no doubt, some good parts in 
our present constitution ; many bad ones we know 
we have. Wherefore, no time can be misspent in 
separating the wheat from the tares. My fear is, that 
you will all get tired and homesick ; the consequence 
of which will be, that you will patch up some kind of a 
constitution as defective as the present. This should 
be avoided. Every man should consider, that he is 
lending his aid to frame a constitution, which is to render 
millions happy or miserable, and that a matter of such 
moment cannot be the work of a day. 

I am in hopes to hear some good accounts from North 
Carolina. If Clinton has only part of his force there, 
and not strongly intrenched, I should think that General 
Lee will be able to give a very good account of those 
at Cape Fear. Surely administration must intend more 
than five thousand men for the southern district, other- 
wise they must have a very contemptible opinion of 
those colonies, or have great expectations from the 
Indians, slaves, and Tories. We expect a very bloody 
summer at New York and Canada, as it is there I pre- 
sume the grand efforts of the enemy will be aimed ; and 
I am sorry to say, that we are not either in men or arms 
prepared for it. However, it is to be hoped, that, if our 
cause is just, as I do most religiously believe it to be, 
the same Providence, which has in many instances ap- 
peared for us, will still go on to afford its aid. Your 
Convention are acting very wisely in removing the disaf- 
fected, and stores, from the counties of Princess Anne 
and Norfolk ; and are much to be commended for their 
attendon to the manufacture of salt, saltpetre, and 
powder. No time nor expense should be spared to ac- 
complish these things. Mrs. Washington is now under

TO MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. ^ l,^ J J ^ 

Philadelphia, 3 June, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

I received your favor by yesterday evening's express, 
with the several letters and intelligence from General 
Schuyler, and am much concerned for the further mis- 
fortunes, that have attended our arms in Canada. I 
have laid the whole before Congress, who had before 
resolved to send a considerable augmentation to our 
army there ; and I doubt not that General Schuyler may 
receive assistance from the militia most convenient to 
him, for securing the different passes and communica- 
tions, dll they can be relieved. As to sending a reinforce- 
ment from New York, neither policy nor prudence will 
justify it, as we have the strongest reasons to believe 
the day not far distant, when a large armament will 
arrive and vigorously attempt an impression there ; to 
oppose which the forces we have will not be more than 
equal, if sufficient. 

Congress have determined on sundry gondolas and 
fire-rafts, to prevent the men-of-war and enemy's ships 
from coming into the New York Bay or Narrows. I 
must therefore request, that you will make inquiries after 
carpenters, and procure all you can, with materials

from hence, whom I have employed to superintend the 
work. He will be there in a day or two.*

Dear Sir, 
I have not time to answer your two last favors mi- 
nutely, but only to acknowledge the receipt of them, 
being just returned from Philadelphia, and the post 
about to depart this morning. The situation of our 
affairs in Canada is truly alarming, and I greatly fear, 
from the intelligence transmitted from thence by Cap- 
tain Wilkinson, in a letter to General Greene,! that ere 
this we have sustained further and greater misfortunes, 
than what had happened when you wrote. I have en- 
closed you a copy of his letter, by which you will see 
I have too much ground for my concern ; and 1 sincerely 
wish the next letters from the northward may not con- 
tain melancholy advices of General Arnold's defeat, and 
the loss of Montreal. The most vigorous exertions will 
be necessary to retrieve our circumstances there, and I 

* After the arrival of Washington in Philadelphia, he received a note 
from the President of Congress, in which he said, — "I am extremely 
sorry it is not in my power to wait on you in person, to execute the com- 
mands of Congress. But being deprived of that pleasure by a severe fit 
of the gout, I am under the necessity of taking this method to acquaint 
you, that the Congress have directed me in their name to make the thanks 
of that body to you, for the unremitted attention you have paid to your 
important trust, and in particular for the assistance they have derived from 
your military knowledge and experience, in adopting the best plans for 
the defence of the United Colonies."

hope you will strain every nerve for that purpose. Un- 
less it can be now done, Canada will be lost ibr ever ; 
the fatal consequences of which every one must feel. 

I have enclosed to you a copy of a resolve of Con- 
gress for reinforcing the army in Canada, and keeping 
up the communication with that province.* 1 hope the 
several colonies will immediately furnish their quotas of 
men, who, or as many of them as may be necessary, 
I should imagine had better be employed at the com- 
munications, and all the enlisted soldiers sent forward 
to Canada. You have, also, another resolution for 
employing and engaging a number of Indians in the 
service, t though Congress have not particularized the 
mode for raising and engaging them. I would have 
you, and the Commissioners appointed for Indian affairs, 
pursue such measures for the purpose, as to you may 
seem best for securing their friendship and service. If a 
smaller number than two thousand will do, I would not 
advise more to be embodied than may be necessary. 



* It was resolved, June 1st, that six thousand militia should be employ- 
ed from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New York, to 
reinforce the army in Canada. 

\ Congress had voted the raising of two thousand Indians for the Cana- 
da service. In reply. General Schuyler very naturally inquired where 
tliey were to be found, and added, that, instead of raising this number for 
the American cause, he thouglit that if they could be prevented from 
joining the enemy it was more than could be expected. The Indians had 
but one maxim in their alliances with the whites, which was to adhere to 
the strongest side, where they were paid the most liberally, and ran the 
least risk. Congress had small means, and were parsimonious from 
necessity. They were moreover averse at first to employing this kind of 
aid, and sought only to keep the savages in a peaceful neutrality. As this 
was not possible, from the fierce and warlike nature of these sons of the 
forest, and as the enemy had no scruples on the subject, it was deemed 
necessary by Congress to seek tlieir assistance. No moment, however, 
could have been more unpropitious for sucli an attempt, than the present, 
when the declining state of affairs in Canada held out feeble encourage- 
ments to a people, who acted upon the principle and with the ultimate 
aim of the savages.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, 7 June, 177(J. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to inform Congress, that I ar- 
rived here yesterday afternoon about one o'clock, and 
found all in a state of peace and quiet. I had not time 
to view the works carrying on, and those ordered to be 
begun when I went away ; but I have reason to believe, 
from the report of such of the general and other officers 
as I had the pleasure to see, that they have been prose- 
cuted and forwarded with all possible diligence and 
despatch. I am much concerned for the situation of 
our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is 
much worse than was first reported at Philadelphia. 
The intelligence from thence not only confirms the ac- 
count of Colonel Bedel's and Major Sherburne's defeat, 
but seems to forebode General Arnold's, with the loss 
of Montreal. I have enclosed a copy of the letter, 
which will but too well show that there is foundation for 
my apprehensions. 

On Wednesday evening I received an express from 
General Schuyler, with sundry papers respecting Sir 
John Johnson, which I have not time to copy, as the 
post is just going off, but I will do myself the honor of 
transmitting them to you as soon as I possibly can. * Be- 



* Sir John Johnson resided at Johnstown, in Tryon county, about forty 
miles north-west of Albany, and possessed large patrimonial estates in 
that neighbourhood. Adhering to the royal cause, and having many of 
the Indians in his influence, as well as two or three hundred Highlanders, 
who were liis tenants, an eye was kept upon his conduct. In January he 
had given his parole, that he would take no part against the colonies. See 
Remembrancer, Vol. III. p. 45. But General Schuyler received such in- 
telligence as convinced him, that Sir Jolui was secretly instigating tlie 
Indians, by which he had virtually broken his parole, and was likely to 
produce much mischief on the frontiers. To prevent such a calamity, he

fore I left Philadelphia, I employed a person to superin- 
tend the building of the gondolas, which Congress had 
resolved on for this place. He is arrived, and all things 
seem to be in a proper channel for facilitating the work ; 
but when they are done, we shall be in much want of 
guns, having never received any of those taken by 
Commodore Hopkins. Be pleased to mention me to 
Congress with the utmost respect. I am. Sir, with 
every sentiment of regard and esteem, your and their 
most obedient servant. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

Sir,

to go by the post, but was prevented by his depart- 
ure before the usual time, I mentioned my having 
received by express a letter and sundry papers from 
General Schuyler, respecting Sir John Johnson, copies 



thought it advisable to secure Sir John, and quell the rising spirit of hos- 
tility, which lie was fomenting among the inhabitants and Indians in that 
quarter. Colonel Dayton, with a part of his regiment then on its way to 
Canada, was despatched to prosecute this enterprise. But Sir John, 
getting notice of the preparations, and suspecting the object, made his 
escape to the westward, and sought security with the Indians, and a small 
British force on tiie lakes. Sir Jolm's papers were examined by Colonel 
Dayton, in compliance with his orders, and Lady Jolinson was removed to 
Albany, where she was retained as a kind of hostage for the peaceable 
conduct of her husband. She wrote to General Wasliington, complaining 
of this detention and asking his interference for her release ; but he left 
the matter with General Schuyler and the Albany Committee. Colonel 
Dayton was stationed for several weeks at Johnstown, with the troops 
under his command. Sir John Johnson returned not again ; in the Janua- 
ry following he found his way to New York, then in possession of the 
British army. He was a son of Sir William Johnson, so well known in 
the history of the last French war.

of which I herewith transmit to you for your inspection 
and perusal. They will show you what measures were 
planned and attempted for apprehending him, and secur- 
ing the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county. In perus- 
ing the several resolves you honored me with when at 
Philadelphia and since my return, I find one allowing a 
chief engineer for the army in a separate department. 
The service requiring many of them, I wish Congress, 
if they know any persons skilled in this business, would 
appoint them. General Schuyler has frequently applied, 
and suggested the necessity of having some in Canada. 
I myself know of none. I also find there is a resolve 
of the 3d of June for taking Indians into the service, 
which, if literally construed, confines them to that in 
Canada. Is that the meaning of Congress, or that the

place he may think necessary 1

* The President of Congress had written two days before; — "The 
enclosed letter from the Commissioners in Canada, I am commanded by 
Congress to transmit to you. The contents of it are alarming. Our 
army in that quarter is almost ruined for want of discipline and every 
thing else necessary to constitute an army, or keep troops together. The 
Congress, in this situation of our affairs, have resolved that General 
Wooster be recalled from Canada. I am therefore to request you will 
immediately order him to repair to head-quarters at New York." 

It is hardly possible to conceive a more deplorable picture, than that 
drawn by tlie Commissioners in their letter to Congress, dated at 
Montreal, May 27th. " You will have a faint idea of our situation," say 
they, " if you figure to yourself an army broken and disheartened, lialf

tioii of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honora- 
ble Commissioners, is truly alarming ; and I am sorry, 
that my opinion of the ill consequences resulting from 
the short enlistments of the army should be but too well 
confirmed by the experience they have had of the want 
of discipline and order in our soldiery there. This in- 
duces me again to wish Congress to determine on a 
liberal allowance, to engage the troops already in service 
to re-enlist for a longer period, or during the continuance 
of the war ; nor can I forbear expressing my opinion 
of the propriety of keeping the military chest always 
suppHed with money, as evils of the most interesting 
nature are often produced for want of a regular payment 
of troops. The neglect makes them impatient and un- 
easy. I am much surprised at the scarcity of provisions 
there, particularly of flour ; as, from several accounts I 
had received from thence, I was led to expect that 
considerable supplies of that article could be procured 
there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, 
I have written to the commissary to forward more pro- 
T visions, in addition to those already sent. ^ 

^ ' An adjutant and quartermaster general are indispen- 

sably necessary, with assistants. The expense saved to 
the continent by their non-appointment will be but 

wrote to General Wooster to come and take tlie command. When the 
interest of our country and the safety of your army are at stake, we think 
it a very improper time to conceal our sentiments, either with respect to 
persons or things. General Wooster is, in our opinion, totally unfit to 
command your army, and conduct the war. We have hitlierto prevailed 
on him to remain in Montreal. His stay in Uiis colony is unnecessary, and 
even prejudicial to our affairs. We would therefore advise his recall." — 
MS. Letter. 

General Wooster requested from Congress an inquiry into his conduct, 
as commander of the forces in Canada. The subject was referred to a 
committee, who, after a full examination, reported it as their opinion, that 
nothing censurable or blameworthy appeared against him. — Journals,

small and trilling, when put in competition witii the loss 
for want of them. Colonel Fleming, who acted in the 
former capacity under General Montgomery, is now 
here ; but his indisposition is such as to render him 
unfit at this time tor the post ; it is an important one, 
and requires vigor and activity to discharge the duties 
of it. He will be of much service to Colonel Reed, 
the business of whose office will increase considerably 
by the augmentation of the army. It will be irecessary, 
too, that the commissaries in Canada, and the deputy 
quartermaster-generals, should have several assistants 
and clerks ; nor do I think a precise number can be 
fixed on, as a variety of circumstances may and must 
occur to render the number, essential for doing the 
business in those departments, greater or less at differ- 
ent times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it 
indefinite, and with power in the commanding officer to 
allow such as may be wanted. 

I am still in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended 
at the Cedars, or on what terms the surrender was 
made, as the last letter from the Commissioners has 
reference to a former, and mentions an agreement 
entered into, which I have not seen ; but I know of it 
more than I could wish. I am, &,c.

surprise you more than it has done me. But I need not 
touch upon a subject, which you will be so well informed 
of from the fountain-head ; nor should I have given you 
the trouble of a letter by this day's post, but for the 
distracdon, which seems to prevail in the commissary's 
department, as well as others in that quarter ; the ne- 
cessity of having it under one general direcdon; and 
the dissatisfaction of Colonel Trumbull, at the allowance 
made to him by Congress as an equivalent for his trou- 
ble. With respect to this particular matter, I can only 
say, that I think he is a man well suited for the business, 
and that, where a shilling is saved in the pay, a pound 
may be lost by mismanagement in the office ; and that 
his resignation at this time, I mean this campaign, may 
possibly be attended with fatal consequences. I there- 
fore humbly submit to Congress the propriety of hand- 
somely rewarding those gentlemen, who hold such very 
important, troublesome, and hazardous offices, as those 
of commissary and quartermaster. 

In speaking to the former about the supplies neces- 
sary for the troops to be raised, he informed me, that 
the quantity of salt provisions, which was shipping from 
hence, might render his attempts to do it precarious ; 
in consequence of which I desired him to lay the matter 
before the Convention of this colony, which he will do 
this day, but in the mean while he desired Congress might 
be informed of the matter, which I cannot better do

circulated, no one can well tell how ; the movements of 
this kind of people, which are more easy to perceive 
than describe ; the confident report, which is said to 
have come immediately from Governor Tryon, and 
brought by a frigate from Halifax, that the troops at that 
place were embarking for this ; added to a thousand 
incidental circumstances, trivial in themselves, but strong 
from comparison ; leave not a doubt upon my mind, that 
troops arc hourly expected at the Hook.* 

I had no doubt when I left this city for Philadelpliia, 
that some measures would have been taken to secure 
the suspected and dangerous persons of this govern- 
ment before now, and I left orders for the military to 
give every aid to the civil power. But the subject is 
delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore 
have internal as well as external enemies to contend 
with. I have the honor to be, &c. 

* General Howe wrote from Halifax to Lord George Germain, on the 
7th of June, informing him, that the admiral had given orders to the cruis- 
ers off the northern coast to direct all the troops from Europe to proceed 
to New York, from whence they miglit be ordered to their respective 
destinations for the campaign ; and he added, that he should himself pre- 
cede the fleet in a frigate to New York, where he might consult Governor 
Tryon, gain information, and be prepared to concert measures for further 
operations. The plan was to attack New York, penetrate the country, 
and if possible meet the army from Canada. In case of such an event, it 
might be anticipated, that there would be some difficulty between General 
Carleton and General Howe, as to the command, since the former was 
older in rank ; but General Howe assured the minister, that no such diffi- 
culty would arise, that he should yield the precedency to General Carleton 
when their forces were united, suggesting that the armies might be en- 
camped separately, each general retaining command over Iiis own division 
in whatever related to its internal management, subject to a single head in 
what pertained to the whole, as in the case of allied armies. — MS. Letter.

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

* New York, 10 June, 1776. 

Sir, 

Before this, I presume you have received the resolve 
of Congress for augmenting our army here and in 
Canada, with their requisition for the quota of men to 
be furnished by your colony.* I must beg leave to 
add, that, from intelligence I have received, and a variety 
of circumstances combining to confirm it. General Howe, 
with the fleet from Halifax, or some other armament, is 
hourly expected at the Hook, with designs doubtless to 
make an impression here, and possess themselves of 
this colony, which is of the last importance to us in the 
present controversy. Our works are extensive and 
many, and the troops here but few for their defence, 
being gready reduced by the regiments detached on the 
Canada expedition. 

In this critical conjuncture of affairs, the experience 
I have had of your zeal and readiness to assist the 
common cause, induces me to request the most speedy 
and early succour, that can be obtained from your colony, 
and that the militia may be forwarded, one battalion 
after another, as fast as they can possibly be raised, 
without waiting to make up the whole complement to 
be furnished for this place, before any of them march, 
I would advise, that they come properly provided with 
field and other officers, and that the person appointed 
by the colony to command the whole be here a day or 
two before them, to receive his orders, and to be in readi-

ness to take the command on their amval. It will be

New Vork, 13 June, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 

If the accounts of Colonel Bedel's and Major Butter- 
field's conduct be true, they have certainly acted a part 
deserving the most exemplary notice. I hope you will 
take proper measures, and have good courts appointed 
to bring them, and every other officer, that has been or 
shall be guilty of misconduct, to trial, that they may 
be punished according to their offences. Our misfor- 
tunes at the Cedars were occasioned, as it is said, en- 
tirely by their base and cowardly behaviour, and cannot 
be ascribed to any other cause. V'^ 

In my letter of the 7th, which will have reached you 
ere this, I enclosed a resolve of Congress for engag- 
ing the Indians, not more than two thousand, in our 
service. This will indicate to you their opinion ; and 
knowing their sentiments fully upon this head, I cannot , 

but advise, that you forthwith hold a conference with the 
Six Nations, and any others, whom you and your broth- 
er commissioners may think necessary ; and form with 
them an alliance on such terms and conditions, as shall 
seem most likely to secure their interest and friendship, 
without waiting the further directions of Congress. 

The situation of our affairs will not suffer delay, 
and I am persuaded your conduct, and the speech you

intend to oeliver the Sachems, will meet their approba- 
tion and thanks. I think that part of it, wliich mentions 
the time and place of our taking post, might be omitted ; 
but this I leave to you. I shall inform Congress of 
what I have written to you on this subject, and of the 
verbal intelligence you sent me by Bennet from Albany, 
when you overtook him, respecting the Indians coming 
down the Mohawk River under Sir John Johnson, and 
of your preparing to resist them. I sincerely wish you 
success, and that their first incursions and attempts 
against us may be attended with their entire defeat. It 
will be necessary to employ Colonel Dayton and his 
regiment in this service, and in securing a post where 
Fort Stanwix formerly stood, which I esteem of much 
importance ; but I submit it to you, who are much 
better acquainted with that country than I am, whether, 
previous to that, it will not be necessary and essential, 
that a post be established lower down somewhere about 
the falls below the German Flats, to secure our commu- 
nication with that garrison. Should this not be done, 
will it not be in the power of the savages to come be- 
tween that and our frontiers, and intercept all supplies 
of men and provisions going thither? 

I observe you esteem the ground opposite to Ticon- 
deroga to be the most advantageous for a post against 
the enemy. Messrs. Chase and Carroll had told me 
the same. I should think, therefore, that the place most 
capable of defence, and having the greatest advantages, 
should be improved, and necessary works thrown up, 
with the utmost despatch. But will not both be best? 
Cannot Ticonderoga be kept, and this improved and 
maintained at the same time? I must submit this to 
you. If you know of any persons, who can be of ser- 
vice as engineers, do employ them. I know of none my- 
self, nor have I one whom I can possibly spare. I am, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. ^ Q.^ , , 
Head-Quarters, New York, 13 June, 1776. 

Sir, 

I have the honor of transmitting to Congress a letter, 
which came by express last night from General Schuy- 
ler, enclosing a copy of a letter to him from Colonel 
Kirkland. I have likewise enclosed the copy of one 
directed to General Putnam, or the commanding officer 
at New York. The representations contained in these 
letters have induced me, without waiting the determina- 
tion of Congress, to direct General Schuyler immediate- 
ly to commence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to 
engage them in our interest, upon the best terms he 
and his colleagues in commission can procure ; and I 
trust the urgency of the occasion will justify my pro- 
ceeding to the Congress. The necessity for decision 
and despatch in all our measures, in my opinion, be- 
comes every day more and more apparent. The ex- 
press, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by General 
Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort George, 
that a considerable body of Mohawk Indians were 
coming down the Mohawk River under the conduct of 
Sir John Johnson. The general's extreme hurry would 
not allow him to write ; but it seems his intention is to 
collect at Albany a sufficient force to oppose Sir John. 
I have given him my opinion, that Colonel Dayton's 
regiment should be employed in that service, and to 
secure the post where Fort Stanwix formerly stood. 

In consequence of information, that several mer- 
chants were exporting salt pork and beef from this 
place, I requested the commissary to make application to 
the Provincial Congress for a restraint to be laid on the 
exportation of those articles, as I apprehended, not only 
that the enemy might receive supplies by the capture 



'-M-vT 



420 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

of our vessels, but that our people might shortly experi- 
ence a scarcit}'. The Provincial Congress have accord- 
ingly made a resolution to stop the exportation for 
fourteen days. They expect Congress will in the mean 
time frame some general regulations on this head. They 
are unwilling, they say, to subject their constituents to 
partial restraints. 

I once mentioned to Congress, that I thought a war- 
office extremely necessary, and they seemed inclined 
to institute one for our army ; but the affair seems to 
have been since dropped. Give me leave again to in- 
sist on the utility and importance of such an establish- 
ment. The more I reflect upon the subject, the more I 
am convinced of its necessity, and that affairs can never 
be properly conducted without it. 

It is with pleasure that I receive the resolve enclosed 
in your favor of the 1 1 th instant. One considerable 
ground of dissatisfaction in the army is thereby removed. 
I have employed persons in building gondolas and rafts, 
which the Congress thought necessary for the defence 
of this place, and, in conjunction with the Provincial 
Congress, I have determined to sink chevaux de /rise 
one of which is already begun. 

'yvvt ' lU^ June '[4th. — I herewith transmit to you copies of a 
letter from General Schuyler, and its several enclosures, 
which I have received since I had the honor of addressing

of our frontier friends in this colony, that our savage

New York, l.'? June, 1770. 

Dear Sir, 

Intelligence having been received of the unfortunate 
death ol' General Thomas, occasioned by the smallpox, 
the command of the army in Canada devolves on you. 
I am therefore to request your most strenuous exertions 
to retrieve our circumstances in that quarter from the 
melancholy situation, which they are now in, and to per- 
form the arduous task of bringing order out of confusion. 
I confess there is more room for enterprise and activity, 
than I could wish ; but then you will remember, that 
you and your colleagues will be entitled to the grateful 
thanks of your country, in proportion to the services you 
render. 

Being extremely hurried in sending despatches to 
Congress and General Schuyler, I have not time to write 
to you so fully as I could wish ; and therefore shall only 
add my request, that you from time to time make me 
regular returns of the strength of the army, military 
stores, and any material occurrence. Wishing that you 
and your associates, under the direction of a gracious 
Providence, may lead your army to conquest and victo- 
ry, I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

is only to be lamented that the affair was attended with

the deatli of Captain Mugford. He seemed to deserve 
a better fate. I am this moment favored with yours, 
advising me of the capture, made by the armed vessels, 
of one of the transports with a company of Highlanders 
on board, and I flatter myself, if our vessels keep a good 
look our, as the whole fleet which sailed with her is 
bound to Boston, that more of them will fall into our 
hands. 

I am extremely sorry that your health is more and 
more impaired, and, having heard by a letter from Presi- 
dent Hancock, that Mr. Whitcomb, Colonel Whitcomb's 
brother, is appointed a brigadier-general, I shall order 
him to relieve you as soon as I am informed, that he 
accepts his commission ; and if he does, you may im- 
mediately call him to your assistance, before I am certi- 
fied of his acceptance. This will ease you of some 
trouble, till I can regulate a few matters of importance 
here, which I hope to do in a little time. 

I am, Sir, your most obedient servant.

;• M^ (2, / l/ sT New York, 16 June, 1776. 

Dear Sir, 
I was favored with yours of the 5th and 6th instant 
by express yesterday evening from General Schuyler ; 
and I am exceedingly happy on account of the agreea- 
ble and interesting intelligence it contains. Before it 
came to hand, I almost dreaded to hear from Canada, 
as my advices seemed to promise nothing favorable, 
but rather further misfortunes. But I now hope, that 
our affairs, from the confused, distracted, and almost 
forlorn state, in which you found them, will emerge and 



PakiII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 423 

assume an aspect of order and success.* I am con- 
vinced that many of our misfortunes are to be attributed 
to a want of discipline, and a proper regard to the con- 
duct of the soldiery. Hence it was, and from our feeble 
efforts to protect the Canadians, that they had almost 
joined and taken part against us. As you are fully 
apprized of this, and conceive them well disposed to- 
wards us, with confidence I trust, you will take every 
step in your power to conciliate and secure their friend- 
ship. If this can be effected, of which you seem to 
have no doubt, I see no objection to our indulging a 
hope that this country, of such importance in the present 
controversy, may yet be added to us and complete our 
union. I confess this interesting work is now more 
difiicult, than it would have been heretofore, had matters 
been properly conducted ; but yet, I flatter myself it 
may be accomplished by a wise, prudent, and animated 
behaviour in the officers and men engaged in it ; 
especially if assisted by the friendly disposition of the 
inhabitants. I think every mark of friendship and favor 
should be shown them, to encourage their zeal and 
attachment to our cause. 

Your conduct in pushing and securing posts low down 
the country is certainly judicious, and of the utmost ad- 
vantage. The farther down we can take and maintain 
posts, the greater will our possession of the country be ; 
observing at the same time the necessity of having a 
safe retreat left, if you should be obliged to abandon 
them by a superior force. I shall anxiously wait in 
the hope to hear of General Thompson's making a suc-

letters were very extraordinary. In his description of affairs, they bore 
the most flattering aspect ; yet twelve days afterwards the whole Ameri-

except General Sullivan, had foreseen and predicted.

cessful attack upon the party intrenching at the Three 
Rivers. Their defeat will be of the most essential 
service. It will chagrin them and disconcert their 
schemes on the one hand, and animate our men and 
give life to our Canadian friends on the other, and efface 
from their minds the unfavorable impressions, which our 
late conduct has made. 

It will be of material consequence, in your advances 
down the country, to secure the several important posts 
as you go ; at which, in case you should be obliged to 
decline the main object you have in view, you may 
make a vigorous and successful stand in your retreat. 
I concur with you in thinking it not of material moment 
to keep a very large number of men at Lachine or the 
upper posts. There should be no more than will be 
necessary to repel such attacks and attempts, as may be 
made by the savages, and the regular troops above you ; 
allowing for such a number of disaffected Canadians as 
may join them. But then there should be a sufficient 
number for that purpose, as our further misfortunes 
there might be of the most injurious consequence. If 
they can be maintained, the disaffected above will dwin- 
dle away, and the insurrection threaten nothing dis- 
astrous. 

It is impossible for me at this distance, and not ac- 
quainted with the situation of affairs as well as you, 
who are on the spot, to give any particular direction for 
your conduct and operations. I therefore have only to 
request, that you with your officers will in every in- 
stance pursue such measures, as the exigency of our 
affairs may seem to require, and as to you shall appear 
most likely to advance and promote the interest and 
happiness of your country. 

It is my most earnest request, that harmony, a good 
understanding, and a free communication of sentiments 



Part 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 425 

may prevail and be preserved between the general officers 
and the tield-officers, particularly the former. Nothing 
can produce greater benefits than this, nor tend more to 
promote your military operations ; whereas history and 
observation sufficiently evince the fatal consequences, 
which have ever resulted from distrust, jealousy, and 
disagreement among officers of these ranks. Wishing 
therefore your counsels and efforts to be founded in a 
happy union, and to meet the smiles of a kind Provi- 
dence, I am, dear Sir, &:,c. 

P. S. Knowing your great zeal for the cause of your 
country, and your desire to render her every possible ser- 
vice, I must caution you not to put too much to the hazard 
in your exertions to establish her rights, and to receive 
with a proper degree of caution the professions, which 
the Canadians may make. They have the character of 
an ingenious, artful people, and very capable of finesse 
and cunning. Therefore my advice is, that you put not 
too much in their power ; but seem to trust them, rather 
than actually do it too far. I would also have you keep 
all your posts, as you go, well secured, to guard against 
any treacherous conduct.

New York, 17 June, 1776. 

Sir, 

The enclosed came to my hands as a private letter 
from General Sullivan. As a private letter I lay it be- 
fore Congress. The tendency (it requires no explana- 
tion) will account for the contrast between it and the 
letter of General Arnold. That the former is aiming at 
the command in Canada is obvious. Whether he

426 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [M-r. U 

merits it or not, is a matter to be considered ; and that 
it may be considered with propriety, 1 think it my duty 
to observe, as of my own knowledge, that he is active, 
spirited, and zealously attached to the cause. That he 
does not want abilities, many members of Congress can 
testify ; but he has his wants, and he has his foibles. 
The latter are manifested in his httle tincture of vanity, 
and in an over desire of being popular, which now and 
then lead him into embaiTassments. His wants are 
common to us all. He wants experience to move upon 
a large scale ; for the limited and contracted knowledge, 
which any of us have in military matters, stands in 
very little stead, and is greatly overbalanced by sound 
judgment, and some acquaintance with men and books, 
especially when accompanied by an enterprising genius, 
which, I must do General Sullivan the justice to say, I 
think he possesses. 

But, as the security of Canada is of the last impor- 
tance to the well-being of these colonies, I should like 
to know the sentiments of Congress respecting the 
nomination of any officer to that command. The char- 
acter I have drawn of General Sullivan is just, according 
to my ideas of him. Congress will, therefore, determine 
upon the propriety of continuing him in Canada, or 
sending another, as they shall see fit. Whether General 
Sullivan knew of the promotion of General Gates at 
the time of his writing, and that he had quitted the de- 
partment he left him in, when he marched his brigade 
lt^ -'■''' from hence to Canada, I cannot undertake to say ; nor 

can I determine whether his wish to be recalled would 
be changed by it, if he did. I shall add no more than 
my respectful compliments to Congress, and that I have 
the honor to be, with every sentiment of regard and 
esteem, Sir, &-c.

TO THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

New York, 17 .Tune, 1776, X HW^C. /& ^ 

Gentlemen, 

It is with no small degree of pain, that I am under 
the necessity of informing you, that it is out of my power 
at this time to comply with the request made by your 
honorable body.* The many important works carrying 
on for the defence of this place, against which there is 
the highest probability of an attack being made in a little 
time, will not allow me to spare from hence any person 
having the least skill in the business of an engineer. I 
have but one on whose judgment I should wish to de- 
pned in laying out any work of the least consequence. 
Congress well know my wants in this instance, and 
several of my late letters to them have pressed the ap- 
pointment of gentlemen qualified for the business. 

On account of this deficiency, I have not been able 
to secure or improve two posts in the Highlands, esteem- 
ed of the utmost importance to prevent the enemy from 
passing up the North River, and getting into the interior 
parts of this colony, should our attempts to stop them 
here prove ineffectual. But I beg you to be assured, 
that as soon as it is in my power, I shall with infinite 
pleasure direct a person to attend the Committee for two 
or three days, if the service will not admit of longer 
absence, in order to trace out such works, and plans for 
carrying them on, as shall appear necessary ; and wish-

the Continental expense. The Committee had requested tlie Commander-

Sir, 

I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors 
of the 14th and 18th instant, and the interesting re- 
solves contained in them, with which I have been 
honored. The several matters recommended to my 
attention shall be particularly regarded, and the direc- 
tions of Congress and your requests complied with in 
every instance, as far as in my power. 

The instituting a war-office is certainly an event of 
great importance, and, in all probability, will be recorded 
as such in the historic page. The benefits derived from 
it, I flatter myself, will be considerable, though the plan 
upon which it is first formed may not be entirely perfect. 
This, like other great works, in its first edidon, may not 
be free from error ; time will discover its defects, and 
experience suggest the remedy, and such further im- 
provements as may be necessary ; but it was right to 
give it a beginning, in my opinion.* The recommenda-

to committees, selected as occasion required, and Congress acted upon 
their reports. This being found a tedious and ineffectual mode of pro- 
cedure, without method or consistency, a permanent committee was at 
length appointed, under the name of the Board of JFar and Ordnance, 
having specific duties and powers, and consisting of five members, with a 
secretary and the necessary clerks. It was the duty of this Board to 
obtain and preserve an alphabetical register of all the oflicers in the Con-

tion of the Convention of New York for restraining and 
punishing disaffected persons, I am hopeful, will be 
attended with salutary consequences ; and the prohibi- 
tion against exporting provisions appears to have been a 
measure founded in sound policy, lest proper supplies 
should be wanted, wlierewith to furnish our armies. I 
have transmitted to General Schuyler the resolves about 
the Indians, and the others on which he is to act ; and 
have requested his strict attention and exertions in order 
to their being carried into execution with all possible 
despatch. 

I have communicated to Major-General Gates the re- 
solve of Congress for him to repair to Canada, and 
directed him to view Point-au-fer,* that a fortress may 
be erected if he shall judge necessary. He is prepar- 
ing for his command, and in a few days will take his 
departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there 
will give our affairs a complexion different from what 
they have worn for a long time past, and that many es- 
sential benefits will result from it. The kind attention 
Congress have shown to afford the Commander-in-chief 
here every assistance, by resolving that recommendatory 
letters be written to the Conventions of New Jersey and 
New York, and the Assembly of Connecticut, to authorize 
him to call in the militia in case of exigency, claims my

Colonies ; to have the care and direction of all the prisoners of war, ac- 
"irding to the orders and regulations of Congress;" and to keep a careful 
record of all their letters and transactions. 

The persons chosen for the first Board of War, were John Adams, Sher- 
man, Harrison, Wilson, and Edward Rutledge. The secretary was Rich- 
ard Peters. — Journals of Congress, June 12th, 13lh.

execution, will produce many advantages in case it may 
be expedient at any time to call in early reinforcements. 
The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequent-

and will add to their numbers several of the militia, 
when they come in, to expedite them with all possible

attention to them, and most active exertions for accom- 
plishing and carrying the whole into execution with all 
possible despatch. 

I hope the bounty, which Congress have agreed to 
allow, as you will perceive by the last resolve, will prove 
a powerful inducement to engage the Indians in our 
service, and their endeavours to make prisoners of all 
the King's troops they possibly can.* You will use 
every method, which you shall judge necessary, to con-

of two transports more being taken by our armed ves- 
sels, with two hundred and ten Highland troops on 
board. * 

I sincerely wish the same success had attended our 
arms in another quarter; but it has not. In Canada, 
the situation of our affairs is truly alarming. The en- 
closed copies of Generals Schuyler's, Sullivan's, and 
Arnold's letters will inform you, that General Thompson 
has met with a repulse at Three Rivers, and is now a 
prisoner in the hands of General Burgoyne, who, these 
accounts say, is arrived with a considerable army.f 
Nor do they seem to promise an end of our misfortunes 
there ; it is greatly to be feared, that the next advices 
from thence will be, that our shattered, divided, and 
broken army, as you will see by the return, have been 
obliged to abandon the country, and retreat, to avoid a 
greater calamity, that of being cut off or becoming 
prisonei's. I will have done upon the subject, and leave 
you to draw such conclusions as you conceive, from the 

* Several British armed ships had kept possession of Nantasket Road, 
from the time Boston was evacuated. On the 13th of June, in the even- 
ing, General Ward ordered five hundred men, and a detachment of the train 
of artillery with a thirteen-incli mortar, two eightcen-pounders, and some 
small cannon, under the command of Colonel Whitcomb, to take post on 
Long Island, and annoy the British ships. The necessary works were thrown 
up in the night, and the next morning the cannon and mortar opened a 
fire, and soon drove the vessels out of the harbour. The fleet consisted 
of thirteen in number, the Renown, of fifty guns, several smaller ships of 
war, and transports with Highland troops on board. They blew up the 
light-house as they went off, and put to sea. 

General Ward wrote ; — " The Colonel taken in the transports is 
Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, commander of one of General Frazer's 
battalions of Highlanders ; he is a member of Parliament, and a gentle- 
man of fortune." 

t Two days after General Sullivan's arrival at Sorel, lie sent General 
Thompson, at the head of three regiments, to meet and attack the enemy 
at Three Rivers. By an unlucky scries of accidents, his party was 
assailed and beaten, and himself and otlier officers were taken prisoners.

State of facts, ai'e most likely to result ; only adding my 
apprehensions, that one of the latter events, cither that 
they are cut off, or become prisoners, has already hap- 
pened, if they did not retreat while they had an oppor- 
tunity. General Schuyler and General Arnold seem to 
think it extremely probable ; and if it has taken place, 
it will not be easy to describe all the fatal consequences 
that may flow from it. At least our utmost exertions 
will be necessary, to prevent the advantages they have 
gained from being turned to our greater misfortunes. 
General Gates will certainly set out to-morrow, and 
would have gone before now, had he not expected to 
receive some particular instructions from Congress, 
which Colonel Braxton said he imagined would be 
given, and transmitted hither. 

Enclosed is a copy of a letter from General Arnold 
to General Schuyler, respecting some of the Indian 
tribes, and a talk had at Albany with thirteen of the 
Oneidas. They seemed then to entertain a friendly 
disposition towards us, which I wish may not be chang- 
ed by the misfortunes we have sustained in Canada. 

I have the honor to be Slc.

general, and sucli other officers as you shall find neces- 
sary for the good of the service. You are also em- 
powered to fill up all vacancies in the army in Canada, 
and notify the same to Congress for their approbation. 

You are also authorized, until the first of October 
next, to suspend any otticers and fill up all vacancies, 
transmitting to the honorable Congress such order and 
suspension, giving your reasons therefor, and specifying 
the particular charge made against such officer. You are 
directed, previous to your departure, to consult with the 
commissary-general, and concert with him the most 
effectual measures for continuing proper supplies of 
provisions for that department. You are in like manner 
to consult with Colonel Knox about the artillery, which 
may be wanted, and what may probably be procured 
there ; and whether any brass or iron field-pieces can 
be spared from hence for that service. 

Upon your arrival in Albany, you will consult with 
General Schuyler, in regard to the present state of pro- 
visions and stores, and fix upon some certain means of 
forwarding the regular supplies in future from that place. 
At the same time, endeavour to learn whether supplies 
heretofore sent have not reached that department, and 
by what means such failures have happened, that a 
proper remedy may be provided. From General 
Schuyler you will also receive such advice and informa- 
tion, respecting the operations of the campaign, as may 
be useful and necessary. You are to direct all the 
general officers, deputy quartermaster-general, local 
commissaries, paymaster in Canada, and all other per- 
sons there, or on the communication, without delay to 
render their accounts and setde them. No general 
officer on such settlement is to receive pay as colonel 
of a regiment, nor any field-officer as captain of a 
company. 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 435 

Upon your taking the command of the troops, you 
Avill give particular orders, agreeably to a rule of Con- 
gress, that no officer .shall sutde or sell to the soldiers, 
on penalty of being fined one month's pay, and of being 
dismissed the service with infamy ; that all sales of 
arms, clothing, ammunition, and accoutrements, made 
by soldiers, are to be deemed void ; and that the 
baggage of officers and soldiers is hereafter to be regu- 
lated conformably to the rules of the British army. 

By a like resolve no troops in Canada are to be dis- 
banded there, but all soldiers in that country ordered to 
be disbanded, or, their dmes of enUstment being ex- 
pired, refusing to re-enlist, shall be sent under proper 
officers to Ticonderoga, or such other posts on the lakes, 
as you shall direct, where they are to be mustered, and 
the arms, accoutrements, blankets, and utensils, which 
they may have belonging to the pubhc, shall be delivered 
up and deposited in the public store. You will, as soon 
as possible, make as accurate a return as you can pro- 
cure of the troops, artillery, arms, ammunition, provis- 
ions, and stores, which you find in Canada, or upon the 
communication with Albany, distinguishing where sta- 
tioned, and in what magazines ; and, if possible, trans- 
mit such a return to the honorable Continental Congress, 
and to me, once a fortnight. 

The distance of the scene, and the frequent chan- 
ges, which have happened in the state of our affairs in 
Canada, do not allow me to be more particular in my 
instructions. The command is important, the service 
difficult but honorable, and I most devoutly pray, that 
Providence may crown our arms with abundant success.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

New York, 24 Juno, 177t). 

Dear Sir, 

The accounts transmitted by General Sullivan are 
truly alarming, and I confess I am not without appre- 
hension lest the next advices should be, that the 
unfortunate defeat and capture of General Thompson 
have been succeeded by an event still more unfortunate, 
the destruction of a large part if not the whole of our 
army in that quarter. The weak, divided, and dis- 
heartened state, in which General Sullivan represents it 
to be, does not seem to promise any thing much more 
favorable, and it is what General Arnold appears to be 
suspicious of. From the whole of the accounts, sup- 
posing the facts all true, there was nothing left to pre- 
vent their ruin, but a retreat. That, I hope, has been 
made, as the only means of saving themselves, and 
rendering their country the least service. 

By reason of the succession of ills, that has attended 
us there of late, and this last one, I fear we must give 
up all hopes of possessing that country, of such impor- 
tance in the present controversy, and that our views 
and utmost exertions must be turned to prevent the in- 
cursions of the enemy into our colonies. To this end, 
I must pray your strictest attention, and request that you 

forces in that province. He enjoyed a high popularity in Congress at this 
time. Richard Henry Lee, writing to Washington, June 13th, says, " It is 
more than probable, tliat Congress will order our friend Gates to Canada. 
His great ability and virtue will be absolutely necessary to restore things 
there, and his recommendations will always be readily complied with. 
You will find, that great powers are given to the commander in that distant 
department. The system for Canada, adopted since the arrival of the 
Commissioners here, will, I hope, bo of essential service to our officers. 
All good men pray most heartily for your health, happiness, and success, 
and none more than your affectionate liriend." 



Part II.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 437 

will use all the means in your power to fortify and secure 
every important post and place on the communication. 
You are as much impressed with the necessity of the 
measure, as any man can be ; and with confidence I 
trust, that nothing you can do will be wanting to effect 
it. If the troops have retreated, they will in a little 
time, I hope, complete such works on the passes, as to 
bid defiance to the most vigorous efforts of the enemy 
to peneti-ate our country ; especially when you are 
assisted by the militia, who most probably are on their 
march ere now. Had this imfortunate defeat not hap- 
pened, the militia were designed, not only to reinforce 
the army in Canada, but to keep up the communication 
with that province, as you will see by recurring to the 
resolve directing them to be employed.* 

Major-General Gates, whom Congress had appointed 
to command after General Thomas's death, will set out 
to-morrow. As Colonel Parsons has requested you to 
send the person, who is supposed to have murdered his 
brother, I have no objection to your doing it, if you 
judge it necessary. He, from what I have been told, 
designs to apply to Congress for instituting some mode 
of trial for the offence. 

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

ardent and patriotic Joseph Hawley, of Massachusetts, June 91st, relating 
to the proposed reinforcements of militia,jis characteristic of the author.^^ 

"Tlie most important matters are soon to be decided by arms. Un- 
happy it is for the Massachusetts, and I fear for the whole continent, that 
at this season we have a numerous assembly. More than one half the

when every thing calls for the utmost ardor and despatch. The Lord 
have mercy upon us ! This colony, I imagine, will raise the men required 
by Congress, before snow falls, but in no season for the relief of either 
New York or Canada. Pray, Sir, consider what there is to be done. It 
is my clear opinion, that there will not a single company move in this 
colony for either of those places these three weeks. I know, Sir, it will

438 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
fyiAO ft . /S'yS* New York, 27 June, 1776. 

Sir, 

I this morning received, by express, letters from Gen- 
erals Schuyler and Arnold, with a copy of one from 
General Sullivan to the former, and also of others to Gen- 
eral Sullivan; of all which I do myself the honor to 
transmit to you copies. They will give you a further ac- 
count of the melancholy situation of our affairs in Cana- 
da, and show that there is nothing left to save our army 
there but evacuating the country. 

I am hopeful General Sullivan would retreat from 
the Isle-aux-Noix, without waiting for previous orders 
for that purpose ; as, from Generals Schuyler's and 
Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remain- 
ing there any considerable time, his retreat w^ould be 
cut off, or at least be a matter of extreme difficulty. I 
would observe to Congress, that it is not in my power 
to send any carpenters from hence to build the gondo- 
las and galleys, which General Arnold mentions, w ithout 
taking them from a work of the same kind, equally 

ready to die within me, at others my blood to press out at the pores of 
my body. But what shall be the expedients ? I never was good at them. 
If I may say it, I am astonished at the policy of Congress, in ordering 
more regiments here, instead of ordering those, wliich are here, to parts 
where they are infinitely more needed ; but my opinion is little worth. 
Such as it is, I have given it." 

Again, Mr. Hawley pressed this subject, on the 27th of June, and 
added, — "For God's sake, if it is possible, let all Ward's people be in- 
stantly ordered to Canada, or to some place where they are more needed 
than here. Pray, Sir, consider that they are officered, armed, and equip- 
ped, in all respects. Every thing is to be done for the militia. Our people 
will fight here pro aris et focis ; but very few of them, believe me, will 
be got to Canada this year. I pray your Excellency's pardon for my 
troublesome repetition of this matter to you. I am here, and see the true 
state and posture of aflfairs. No place on the continent I conceive is more 
secure than Boston."

necessary, if not more so, here ; and I submit it to them 
whether it may not be advisable (as it is of great im- 
portance to us to have a number of those vessels on 
the lake, to prevent the enemy's passing,) to withdraw 
the carpenters for the present from the frigates building 
up the North River, and detach them immediately, with 
all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpose and 
for carrying on those here. 

I have the pleasure to inform you of another capture, 
made by our armed vessels, of a transport on the 19th 
instant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on 
board. The enclosed extract of a letter from General 
Ward, by last night's post, contains the particulars ; to 
which I beg leave to refer you. I have transmitted 
to General Schuyler a copy of the resolve of Congress 
respecting the Mohickan and Stockbridge Indians, and 
directed him to put an immediate stop to the raising ol" 
the two companies. 

Upon information that Major Rogers was travelling ^ J^)^^;^ (^. / f 
through the country under suspicious circumstances, I 
thought it necessary to have him secured. I therefore 
sent after him. He was taken at South Amboy, and 
brought up to New York. Upon examination, he in- 
formed me that he came from New Hampshire, the 
country of his usual abode, where he had left his family ; 
and pretended he was destined to Philadelphia on busi- 
ness with Congress. 

As by his own confession he had crossed Hudson's 
River at New Windsor, and was taken so far out of his 
proper and direct route to Philadelphia, this consideration, 
added to the length of time he had taken to perform his 
journey, his being found in so suspicious a place as 
Amboy, his unnecessary stay there on pretence of 
getting some baggage from New York, and an expecta- 
tion of receiving money from a person here, of bad 



440 VVASIIINGTOIN'S WRITINGS. [^t. 44. 

character, and in no circumstances to furnish him out of 
his own stock, the Major's reputation, and his being a 
half-pay officer, have increased my jealousies about him. 
The business, which he informs me he has with Con- 
gress, is a secret offer of his services, to the end that, 
in case it should be rejected, he might have his way left 
open to an employment in the East Indies, to which he 
is assigned ; and in that case he flatters himself he will 
obtain leave of Congress to go to Great Britain. 

As he had been put upon his parole by Congress, I 
thought it w^ould be improper to stay his progress to 
Philadelphia, should he be in fact destined thither. I 
therefore send him forward, but, to prevent imposition, 
rmder the care of an officer, with letters found upon 
him, which, from their tenor, seem calculated to recom- 
mend him to Congress. I submit it to their considera- 
tion, whether it would not be dangerous to accept the 
offer of his services. * 

June 2Sth. — Congress, I doubt not, will have heard 
*'"''' t . ' . of the plot, that was forming among many disaffected 
persons in this city and government for aiding the King's 
troops upon their arrival. No regular plan seems to 
have been digested ; but several persons have been en- 
listed, and sworn to join them. The matter, I am in 
hopes, by a timely discovery, will be suppressed and 
put a stop to. Many citizens and others, among whom 
is the mayor, are now in confinement. The matter 
has been traced up to Governor Tryon ; and the 
mayor appears to have been a principal agent between 
him and the persons concerned in it. The plot had

my guard engaged in it. Thomas Hiclcey, one of tliem, 
has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court- 
martial, is sentenced to die, having enlisted himself, and 
engaged others. The sentence, by the advice of the 
whole council of general officers, will be put in execution 
to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried. I 
am hopeful this example will produce many salutary 
consequences, and deter others from entering into the 
like traitorous practices.* 

The enclosed copy of a resolve of the Provincial 
Congress will show, that some of the disaffected on 
Long Island have taken up arms. I have, agreeably to 
their request, sent a party after them, but have not as 
yet been able to apprehend them, having concealed 
themselves in different woods and morasses. General 
Gates set out on Tuesday with a fine wind, which has 
been fair ever since, and would soon arrive at Albany. 
I have this moment received a letter from Lieutenant Da- 
vison, of the Schuyler armed sloop, a copy of which I have 
enclosed ; to which I beg leave to refer you for the in- 
telligence communicated by him.f I could wish Gene- 
ral Howe and his armament not to arrive yet, as not 
more than a thousand militia have come in, and our 
whole force, including the troops at all the detached 
posts, and on board the armed vessels, which are com- 
prehended in our returns, is but small and inconsidera-

and all others so disgraceful to the character of a soldier, and pernicious 
to his country." 

t Lieutenant Davison gave intelligence, that he had taken four prizes, 
and that one of the prisoners said a fleet of one hundred and thirty sail 
left Halifax for Sandy Hook on the 9th of July^ General Howe himself gfWU^ 
being on board. When the prisoners arrived at head-quarters, they con- 
firmed this report, stating that they had been on board tlie Greyhound, 
one of the vessels of the fleet, and seen General Howe.

ble, when compared with the extensive lines they are

TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

New York, 28 June, 177C. 



Dear Sir, 

I am sorry General Sullivan should have stopped at 
the Isle-aux-Noix, until he could obtain orders for re- 
treating further, thereby hazarding his army without a 
prospect of success, and rendering his retreat liable to 
be interrupted, or at least difficult, in case the enemy 
were in a condition to pursue their victory. For these 
reasons I cannot but approve your directions, and I hope 
they have arrived in time, if he had not before left the 
Isle-aux-Noix, by the advice of his council of war, and 
joint intercession of his officers. My letter of the 24th 
would show you, had it been received, that from his 
representation of matters I thought a retreat the only 
means left for the security of his army, and for their 
doing any essential service to their country. If he 
gets off, I shall be happy that our loss was so incon- 
siderable in numbers, though I regret much the captivity 
of General Thompson. 

I would have you make ready every thing necessary 
for taking post at Fort Stanwix; and, when you are 
prepared, to use your utmost industry for erecting and 
completing the work. Our most vigorous exertions 
will be required in every instance. I am convinced our 
enemies will strain every nerve against us this cam-

paign, and tiy to injure us wherever we may be un- 
provided. It will be extremely proper to forward the 
militia for reinforcing the several garrisons on the com- 
munication, and securing the different passes. I wish 
they were not so slow in repairing to the places of ren- •' vw-t 
dezvous ; but I would fain believe they will be in 
time to prevent any attempts our enemies may have in 
view. I am extremely sorry for your indisposition, and 
that you should be so harassed by the ague and fever ; 
and wishing you a perfect recovery and a speedy one, I 
am, dear Sir, &lc.* 



TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, 20 June, 1776. 

Sir, 

The accounts communicated yesterday through Lieu- 
tenant Davison's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare 
say, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or 
three days past, three or four ships have been dropping 
in ; and I just now received an express from an officer 
appointed to keep a look-out on Staten Island, that 
forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day ; some say more ; 
and I suppose the whole fleet will be in, within a day 

* Congress Iiad come to a resolution to augment the number of troops 
destined for tlie northern department by four thousand, and offered a bounty 
of ten dollars to each soldier, who would enlist for three years. In com- 
municating this intelligence, President Hancock wrote ; — " It is scarcely 
necessary to mention the motives on which Congress acted, or to explain 
the propriety of the measure. The arrival of General Burgoyne with a 
large reinforcement, the known character of that officer for action and 
enterprise, the defeat of General Thompson with the troops under his 
command, and his being made prisoner, are so many circumstances, that 
point out the absolute necessity of being more expeditious in our prepara- 
tions for the defence of Canada, and of increasing our force there."

or two. I am hopeful, before they are prepared to at- 
tack, that I shall get some reinforcements. Be that as 
it may, I shall attempt to make the best disposition I 
can of our troops, in order to give them a proper re- 
ception, and prevent the ruin and destruction they are 
meditating against us. 

, . ^ i^-u9 •^**'^^ SOth. — I had the pleasure of receiving your 
favor of the 29th early this morning, with which you 
have been pleased to honor me, together with the re- 
solves for a further augmentation of our army. The 
battalion of Germans, which Congress have ordered to 
be raised, will be a corps of much service ; and I 
hope, that such persons will be appointed officers, as 
will complete their enlistments with all possible expe- 
dition. I shall communicate to Colonel Stephenson and 
one of his field-otlicers what you have requested, and 
direct them to repair immediately to Philadelphia. It 
is an unlucky circumstance, that the term of enhstment 
of these three companies, and of the rifle battalion, 
should expire at this time Avhen a hot campaign is, in all 
probability, about to commence.* 

Canada, it is certain, would have been an important 
acquisition, and well worth the expenses incurred in the 
pursuit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our 
possession, the retreat of our army with so little loss, 
under such a variety of distresses, must be esteemed a 
most fortunate event. It is true, the accounts we have 
received do not fully authorize us to say, that we have 



* Congress resolved, that four companies of Germans should be raised 
in Pennsylvania, and four companies in Maryland. They also resolved, 
that six companies of riflemen should be enlisted, four of them in Virginia, 
and two in Maryland, to serve for three years, and be formed into a regi- 
ment with three companies already raised in New York. Captain Ste- 
phenson was appointed colonel of this regiment.

sustained no loss ; but they hold forth a probable ground 
for such conclusion. I am anxious to hear it confirmed.* 
I have the honor of transmitting to you an extract of a 
letter received last night from General Ward. If the 
scheme the privateers had in view, and the measures he 
had planned, have been carried into execution, the 
Highland corps will be tolerably well disposed oi"; but 
I fear the fortunate event has not taken place. In Gene- 
ral Ward's letter was enclosed one from Lieutenant- 
Colonel Campbell, who was made prisoner with the 
Highland troops. I have transmitted to you a copy. 
This will give you a full and exact account of the 
number of prisoners on board the four transports ; and 
will prove, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the evacua- 
tion of Boston by the British troops was a matter neither 
known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed, 
so many facts had concurred before to setUe the mat- 
ter, that no additional proofs were necessary. I am, &,c.

doubtedly on some accounts to be viewed in the light of a misfortune. 
The Continent has been put to a great expense in endeavouring to get 
possession of it. That our army should make so prudent a retreat, as to 
be able to save their baggage, cannon, ammunition, and sick from falling 
into the hands of the enemy, is a circumstance, that will afford a partial 
consolation, and reflect honor upon the officers, who conducted it. Con- 
sidering the superior force of the British troops, and a retreat unavoidable, 
every thing has been done, which in such a situation could be expected. 
In short. Sir, I am extremely glad, that our army is likely to get safe out

fleet will be in this day and to-morrow. I beg not a 
moment's time may be lost, in sending forward such 
parts of the militia, as Colonel Reed shall mention. We 
are so very weak at this post, that I must beg you to

TO THE CAPTAIN OF GOVERNOR FRANKLIN S GUARD. 
I^'^ €i ■. S^ % Head-Quarters, New York, 30 June, 177(3. 

Sm, 
I understand that the Convention of New Jersey re- 
solved, that Governor Franklin was an enemy to the 
liberties of America, and that he should be conducted 
under a safeguard into Connecticut, and for that purpose 
he was committed to your charge. I have this morning 

Elizabetlitown. He liad previously been a member of the Continental 
Congress, and afterwards distinguished himself as the vigilant, able, and 
patriotic governor of New Jersey, during the most trying period of the 
revolutionary contest. The Memoir of his life, written by Mr. Sedgwick, 
is a just and valuable tribute to his memory, as a lover of his country, 
and a faithful friend to its liberties. 

On the 29th of June, the following order was issued to the army. 
" The General expects that all soldiers, who are entrusted with the de- 
fence of any work, will behave with great coolness and bravery, and will 
be particularly careful not to throw away their fire. He recommends to 
them to load for their first fire with one musket-ball and four or eight 
buckshot, according to the size and strength of their pieces. The briga- 
diers are to order a circle to be marked round the several redoubts, by 
which their officers are to be directed in giving orders for the first dis- 
charge. Small brush may be set up to make the line more distinct and 
familiar to the men, who are by no means to be ordered to fire before tne 
enemy arrive at the circle."

received information, tliiit j-ou have halted with liim at 
Hackensack. I woukl enjoin it upon you to set ofi' im- 
mediately, and carry the resolve of the Convention into 
execution. Delays are dangerous, and should any 
accident happen, you never could answer for your 
neglect to our much injured country. 

I would, therefore, again repeat to you, that it is my 
advice, immediately on receipt of this, to set forward on 
yoiu- journey with Governor Franklin, and make all 
possible despatch for the place you are ordered to. 
Governor Franklin once had his choice, and chose 
Connecticut, and it is not for you to hesitate on frivolous 
pretences, but to do your utmost to execute the orders 
you have received in every pardcular. I am, &c. 



TO THE COMMITTEE OF ESSEX COUNTY, NEW JERSEY. 

New York, 30 June, 1776. 

Gentlemen, '^- /VVW C , ^^ 

I received your favor by Mr. Treat, and cannot but 
consider the officer of Mr. Franklin's guard extremely 
blamable for his conduct. It is certainly his indispensa- 
ble duty to conduct Mr. Franklin to the place the Con- 
vention have ordered, without delay. The circumstan- 
ces you represent, his letter to his lady, and the whole 
complexion of the case, afford a strong presumption, 
nay, much more, full evidence, that he means to escape 
if possible. He says in his letter, that, " during his 
respite, the time between his writing and getting an an- 
swer from Congress, something may turn up to make 
his removal improper, and, at any rate, to gain time will 
be of advantage." 

I have written to the captain of his guard upon the 
subject ; and, as Mr. Franklin has evinced a most un- 



448 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 44. 

Inendly disposition to our cause, as the colony Conven- 
tion have ordered him to Connecticut, for refusing to 
comply with such terms to procure his liberty as they 
deemed necessary and proper for him to enter into, as 
he does not propose to sign the parole, which they 
formed, but has suggested several alterations, I am of 
opinion your Committee should interfere in the matter, 
and give immediate orders to the officer of the guard 
to proceed with him, in execution of the duty where- 
with he is charged. And, further, if you apprehend 
that there is the least danger of his being rescued, or 
of the guard appointed to escort him being remiss in 
their duty, your Committee should appoint a strong 
escort for the purpose, and direct them to assist in per- 
forming the views of the Convention, and conducting 
him securely to the place fixed upon to receive him. I 
have enclosed the letter for the olHcer of the guard, 
which, having read, you will seal and transmit to him. 

I am, &LC.* 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, 4 July, 1776. 

Sir, 
I have this moment received a letter from General 
Greene, an extract from which I have enclosed. The 

* The New Jersey Convention had declared Governor Franklin to be 
an enemy to his country, and a person that might prove dangerous, and 
had decided that he sliould be confined in such place and manner, as the 
Continental Congress should direct. On considering liis case, the Con-

weight in the present contest. It behoves us to be 
prepared in the best manner ; and I submit it again to 
Congress, whether the accounts given by their prisoners 
do not show the propriety of calling the several Conti- 
nental regiments from the Massachusetts government, 
raising the Flying Camp with all possible despatch, and 
engaging the eastern Indians.*

" The time is now near at hand, which must probably determine whether 
Americans are to be freemen or slaves ; whether they are to have any 
property they can call their own ; whether their houses and farms are to 
be pillaged and destroyed, and they consigned to a state of wretchedness, 
from which no human efforts will probably deliver them. The fate of un- 
born millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct 
of this army. Our cruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us no choice, but 
a brave resistance or the most abject submission. This is all that we 
can expect. We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die. Our own 
country's iionor calls upon us for a vigorous and manly exertion, and if we 
now shamefully fail, we shall become infamous to the whole world. Let 
us rely upon the goodness of the cause, and the aid of the Supreme 
Being, in whose hands victory is, to animate and encourage us to great 
and noble actions. The eyes of all our countrymen are now upon us, and 
we shall have their blessings and praises, if happily we are the instru-

animate and encourage each other, and show the whole world, that a

enemy's crossing from Staten Island if they should have 
any sucii views. The distressed situation of the inhabi- 
tants of Elisabethtown and Newark has since induced 
me, upon their application, to give up all the militia from 
the Jerseys, except those engaged for six months. I 
am hopeful they will be able to repel any incursions, that 
may be attempted. Generals Mercer and Livingston 
are concerting plans for that purpose. By a letter from 
the latter last night, I am informed the enemy are throw- 
ing up small works at all the passes on the north side 
of Staten Island, which it is probable they mean to 
secure. 

None of the Connecticut militia is yet arrived ; so 
that the reinforcement we have received is very incon- 
siderable. A letter from General Schuyler, with sundry 
enclosures, has this moment come to hand, and will no 
doubt claim, as it ought to do, the immediate attention 
of Congress. The evils, which must inevitably follow a 
disputed command, are too obvious and alarming to 
admit a moment's delay in your decision thereupon ; 
and, although I do not presume to advise in a matter 
now of this delicacy, yet as it appears evident, that the 
northern army has retreated to Ci'own Point, and means 
to act upon the defensive only, I cannot help giving it 
as my opinion, that one of the major-generals in that 
quarter would be more usefully employed here, or in 
the Flying Camp, than there ; for it becomes my duty to 



mercenary on earth. The General recommends to the officers great cool- 
ness in time of action, and to the soldiers a strict attention and obedience, 
witli a becoming firmness and spirit. Any officer, or soldier, or any 
particular corps distinguishing itself by any acts of bravery and courage, 
will assuredly meet with notice and rewards ; and, on the other hand, 
those wlio behave ill will as certainly be exposed and punished ; the 
General being resolved, as well for the honor and safety of the country, 
as of the army, to show no favor to sucii as refuse or neglect to do their 
duty at so important a crisis." — Orderly Booh, July 2d.

observe, if another experienced officer is taken from 
hence in order to command the Flying Camp, that yom 
grand army will be entirely stripped of generals, who 
have seen service, being in a manner already destitute 
of such.* My distress on this account, the appoint- 
ment of General Whitcomb to the eastern regiments, a 
conviction in my own breast that no troops will be sent 
to Boston, and the certainty of a number coming to this 
place, occasioned my postponing, from time to time, 
the sending of any general officer from hence to the east- 
ward heretofore ; and now I shall wait the sentiments 
of Congress relative to the five regiments in Massachu- 
setts Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.

Sir, 
Your favor of this date, enclosing Major Duyckinck's 
letter, was this moment received. The known disaffec- 
tion of the people of Amboy, and the treachery of those 
of Staten Island, who, after the fairest professions, have KWT*

ten thousand men, and to be put under the command of such Continental 
officer, as General Washington should direct. These men were to be 
obtained at tlie Continental expense from the militia in Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, and Maryland, and engaged till the 1st of December following, 
unless sooner discharged by Congress. They were now assembling at 
Amboy, under the command of General Mercer. The New Jersey militia, 
commanded by General Livingston, were distinct from those of the Plying 
Camp, being called out expressly for the defence of that province. Con-

from Pennsylvania, and three from New Jersey. — Journals, June '3d and

induced me to give directions, that all persons of known 
enmity or doubtful character should be removed from 
places, where they might enter into a correspondence 
with the enemy, and aid them in their schemes. For 
this end. General Heard has directions to apprehend 
such persons, as from their conduct have shown them- 
selves inimical, or whose situations, connexions, or 
offices have given just cause of suspicion. 

I have no knowledge of the persons apprehended ; 
but I suppose General Heard had good reason for tak- 
ing hold of them. However, if there are any, who, 
from your personal knowledge and opinion, you think 
may be permitted to return, I have no objection, the 
others being sent to the Provincial Congress for their dis- 
posal. But, as to the former, I would suggest to you, 
that my tenderness has been often abused, and I have 
had reason to repent the indulgence shown to them. I 
would show them all possible humanity and kindness, 
consistent with our own safety ; but matters are now too 
far advanced to sacrifice any thing to punctilios. 

General Mercer has just set off for Jersey. In his 
experience and judgment you may repose great confi- 
dence. He wall proceed to Amboy after conferring with 
you. You will please to keep me constandy informed 
of the proceedings of the enemy, and be assured of 
every assistance and attention. I am, &c.*

fullest information of the state of the rebels, who are numerous and very

TO OOVERjVOR TRUMBULL. 

Head-Quarters, New York, 9 July, 1770. 

Sir, 

Colonel Seymour arrived yesterday with a few of his 
men, when I acquainted him, that it would be impossible 
for me to have his horses remain here. Forage is not 
to be procured ; and, if it could be, it would only be at a 
great expense, without a single advantage arising from 
it. The men are absolutely necessary, till the arrival of 
the new levies. Colonel Seymour is to propose the 
matter to them this morning, and return me an answer. 
We have intelligence, which may be relied on, of Lord 
Howe's being on his passage for this place, with a large 
fleet and about fifteen thousand men, and he is hourly 
expected. By several deserters from Staten Island and 
the ships of war, whose accounts all agree. General 
Howe proposes no attempt on us, till the arrival of this 
reinforcement, when, it is said, with a part of his army, 
he will make a descent on the Jersey side, while the 
fleet and the other part of the army in conjunction will 
attack this city. To oppose this force, in which the 
ministry put so much confidence, I think it necessary to 
exert every nerve, that, by defeating their views this 
campaign, we may be enabled to meet them with double 
advantage the next. Should they think proper to pur- 
sue their unwarrantable measures, I hope the good people 

die provinces of New York, the Jerseys, and Connecticut, who in this 
time of universal apprehension only wait for opportunities to give proofs 
of their loyalty and zeal for government. Sixty men came over a few 
days ago with a few arms from the neighbourhood of Shrewsbury in Jer- 
sey, who are all desirous to serve ; and I understand there are five hun- 
dred more in that quarter ready to follow their example. This disposition 
among the people makes me impatient for the arrival of Lord Howe, con- 
cluding tlie powers with which he is furnished will have the best effect at 
this critical time ; but I am still of the opinion, that peace will not be re- 
stored in America until the rebel army is defeated." — MS. Letter.

of your colony or state, will be ready on all occasions 
to tly to our assistance, if needed. I have a confidence 
in them, and doubt not they will be ready and willing. 

To prevent the enemy from obtaining fresh provisions 
is a matter highly necessary to be attended to. I am 
informed, that there are great quantities in the neigh- 
bourhood of New London, namely, at Fisher's, Block, 
Plumb, and Elizabeth Islands, and Martha's Vineyard. 
These are accessible to ships of force, and no doubt 
they will soon be on a plundering voyage. I could wish 
your attention to this matter, that the stock may all be 
removed quite out of reach of the enemy. The east 
end of Long Island, I am told, is not less exposed than 
the others. I think effectual steps will be taken in re- 
gard to that, as I have had a conference with the Con- 
vention of this province, and an order has gone out for 
driving all the stock from the sea-coasts. In the con- 
ference of a full board of general officers yesterday, it 
was recommended, that I should apply to you for the 
three row-galleys, being now at New London, or in the 
river, together with as many heavy cannon as you can 
possibly spare. They will be much wanted here ; and, 
if you find it consistent, I would beg you to forward 
them on as soon as possible. 

I would not have it understood, from what I have said 
above in regard to Colonel Seymour's body of horse, 
that I think their coming forward a wrong step. I think 
it a step, which was highly advisable ; and I am much 
pleased to see with what cheerfulness and despatch your 
orders were executed. Provided they are well armed 
with good muskets, they must always be of greater ser- 
vice, on sudden emergencies to throw in succours when 
called for, than the militia. * I have the honor to be, &.c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL WARD. , i i v ^ . ^"i- 

New York, 9 July, 1776. 

Sir, 

The enclosed Declaration will show you, that Con- 
gress at length, impelled by necessity, have dissolved 
the connexion between the American Colonies and 
Great Britain, and declared them Free and Independent 
States; and in compliance with their order I am to re- 
quest, that you will cause this Declaration to be immedi- 
diately proclaimed at the head of the Continental regi- 
ments in the Massachusetts Bay. It being evident, from 
a variety of concurring circumstances, that the British 
armies mean to direct their most vigorous operations 
this campaign against the State* of New York, to pene- 
trate into it by way of the lakes and the North River, 
and to unite their attacks, ^he importance of it has j t^' 

induced Congress to take further measures, for baffling 
their designs, and rendering it more secure. 

You will see by the resolves now transmitted, that 
the northern army is to be augmented by part of the 
troops under your command ; and I desire, that you will 
immediately detach for that purpose three of the fullest 
regiments forthwith to march to Ticonderoga, or such 
other place as the said army may be at, and put them- 
selves under the order and direcdons of the general 
officer commanding the same. 

You will also perceive, that Congress have resolved, 
that the arms taken in the Scotch transports should be 
sent hither. The President informs me, that he has 
written to the agents respecting them ; but as I presume 
they are in your possession, or in some of the stores by

your order, you will have the whole of them forwarded 
with all possible despatch, in the usual route and with 
necessary directions. Congress have made some altera- 
tion in the establishment of chaplains, and advanced 
their pay, as they ha^•e that of the regimental surgeons ; 
as you will see by their proceedings, copies of which in 
these instances are also transmitted. 

You will be particularly attentive to hasten the 
march of the three regiments, and give proper orders 
for their route, and to the commissary and quarter- 
masters, that every thing necessary for the same may 
be immediately provided. Their aid is much wanted, 
and may be of the utmost importance. When they 
have marched, you will be pleased to put the remaining 
troops under the command of the oldest colonel, with 
such instructions as you may judge necessary, and then 
retire, if it shall be agreeable to you, for the recovery of 
your health, as I cannot possibly request you longer to 
continue ; and, wishing you a speedy restoration of it, 
I am. Sir, very respectfully, &c.* 
P. S. I would have you consult with proper persons

ing the route of the three regiments to be detached to 
the northern department.

and protection of Heaven are at all times necessary, but especially so in 
times of public distress and danger. The General hopes and trusts, that

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, 10 July, 1776. 

Sir, 

I am now to acknowledge the receipt of your two 
favors of the 4th and 6th instant, which came dulj' to 
hand, with their important enclosures. 

I perceive that Congress have been employed in de- 
liberating on measures of the most interesting nature. 
It is certain, that it is not with us to determine in many 
instances what consequences will flow from our coun- 
sels ; but yet it behoves us to adopt such, as, under the 
smiles of a gracious and all-kind Providence, will be 
most likely to promote our happiness. I trust the late 
decisive part they have taken is calculated for that end, 
and will secure to us that freedom and those privileges, 
which have been and are refused to us, contrary to the 
voice of nature and the British constitution. Agreeably 
to the request of Congress, I caused the Declaration 
to be proclaimed before all the army under my im- 
mediate command ; and have the pleasure to inform 
them, that the measure seemed to have their most 
hearty assent ; the expressions and behaviour, both of 
officers and men, testifying their warmest approbation 
of it. I have transmitted a copy to General Ward at 
Boston, requesting him to have it proclaimed to the 
Continental troops in that department.* 

* On communicating the Declaration of Independence to General 
Washington, the President of Congress wrote as follows ; — 

" The Congress, for some time past, have had their attention occupied 
by one of the most interesting and important subjects, that could possibly 
come before them, or any other assembly of men. Although it is not 
possible to foresee the consequences of human actions, yet it is neverthe- 
less a duty we owe ourselves and posterity in all our public counsels, to 
decide in the best manner we are able, and to leave the event to that Being, 
who controls all things, to bring about his own determinations. Impressed

It is with great pleasure, that I hear the militia from 
Maryland, the Delaware government, and Pennsylvania, 
will be in motion every day to form the Flying Camp. It 
is of great importance, and should be accomplished with 
all possible despatch. The readiness and alacrity, with 
which the Committee of Safety of Pennsylvania and the 
other conferees, have acted, in order to forward the 
associated militia of that state to the Jerseys for service, 
till the men to compose the Flying Camp arrive, strongly 
evidence their regard to the common cause, and that 
nothing on their part will be wanting to support it. I 
hope, and I doubt not, that the associated militia, im- 
pressed with the expediency of the measure, will im- 
mediately carry it into execution, and furnish in this 
instance a proof of the continuance of that zeal, which 
has so eminently marked their conduct. I have directed 
the commissary to make the necessary provision for 
their reception, who will also supply the army for the 

with this sentiment, and at the same time fully convinced, that our affairs 
may take a more favorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary 
to dissolve the connexion between Great Britain and the American Colo- 
nies, and to declare them free and independent states ; as you will per- 
ceive by the enclosed Declaration, which I am directed to transmit to you, 
and to request you will have it proclaimed at tlie head of the army, in the 
way you shall think most proper." 

As soon as this communication was received, the following order was 
issued to the army. 

" The Continental Congress, impelled by the dictates of duty, policy, 
and necessity, have been pleased to dissolve the connexion, which subsist- 
ed between this country and Great Britain, and to declare the United 
Colonies of North America, Free and Independent States. Tlie several 
brigades are to be drawn up this evening on tlieir respective parades at 
six o'clock, when the Declaration of Congress, showing the grounds and 
reasons of this measure, is to be read with an audible voice. The Gene- 
ral hopes, that this important event will serve as a fresh incentive to every 
officer and soldier to act with fidelity and courage, as knowing that now 
the peace and safety of his country depend, under God, solely on the 
success of our arms ; and that he is now in the service of a state possess- 
ed of sufficient power to reward his merit, and advance him to the highest 
honors of a free country." — Orderly Book, Jidij 9(A.

Flying Camp with rations. A proper officer will be ap- 
pointed to command it.* 

In pursuance of the power given me by Congress, 
and the advice of my general officers, I have written to 
General Ward, and desired him forthwith to detach 
three of the fullest regiments from the Massachusetts 
Bay to join the northern army, esteeming it a matter 
of the greatest importance to have a sufficient force 
there to prevent the enemy's passing the lake, and mak- 
ing an impression in that quarter. The Connecticut 
militia begin to come in ; but from every account the 
battalions will be very incomplete, owing, they say, to 
the busy season of the year. That government, lest 
any inconvenience might result from their militia not 
being here in time, ordered three regiments of their 
light-horse to my assistance, part of which have arrived. 
But, not having the means to support them (and, if it 
could be done, the expense would be enormous), I have 
thanked the genUemen for their zeal, and the attachment 
they have manifested upon this occasion, and informed 
them, that I cannot consent to their keeping their horses, 
at the same time wishing them to stay themselves. I 
am told they or part of them mean to do so. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

own security and happiness calls upon us to adopt every 
possible expedient to avert the blow, and prevent the 
meditated ruin, impressed with this sentiment, and im- 
pelled by necessity, the Congress have been pleased 
to empower me, as you will perceive by the enclosed 
copy of their resolve, which I have the honor of trans- 
mitting to you, to call to our aid so many of the St. 
John's, Nova Scotia, and Penobscot Indians, as I might 
judge necessary. At the same time they have desired, 
that I should request the assistance of your honorable 
body in carrying their views into execution, and assure 
you, that whatever expenses you may necessarily incur 
in doing it, and as incident to it, they will reimburse. 
Esteeming this service of great importance, particularly 
if the enemy should attempt an impression into the in- 
terior parts of the country, I must entreat your kind 
offices upon this occasion, and your friendly exertions 
immediately to engage, on the best terms you can, five 
or six hundred men of these tribes, and to have them 
marched with all possible expedition to join the army 
here. 

Having professed a strong inclination to take part with 
us in the present contest, it is probable they may be en- 
gaged for less pay and on better terms, than the Conti- 
nental troops ; but, if they cannot, they must be allowed 
the same. The term of their enlistment should be for 
tvi'o or three years, unless sooner discharged (the right 
of which should be reserved to us), if they will engage 
for so long a time ; if not, for such time as they will 
agree, provided it is not too short ; and it must be part 
of the treaty, and enjoined upon them, to bring every 
man his firelock, if it can be possibly efTected. As the 
services they may render will probably depend on their 
early and timely arrival, it is unnecessary to suggest to

Dear Sir, 
I received your favors of the 1st and 2d instant, and 
agreeably to your request transmitted to Congress a 
copy of the former and of its several enclosures. The 
important subjects referred to them have met with their 
attention, and the letter accompanying this will inform 
you and General Gates of the result of their delibera- 
tions. I hope that harmony and a good agreement will 
subsist between you, as the most hkely means of ad- 
vancing the interest of the cause, which you both wish 
to promote. They have determined the matter between 
Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Livingston, and decided the right 
of supplying the northern army, and appointing persons

* General Gates had been appointed to the command in CanaJa, but 
before he reached Albany the army had evacuated that province, and come

matter amicably, and agreed to refer it to Congress, and to act in perfect

Since my last, General Howe's fleet from Halifax has 
arrived, in number about one hundred and thirty sail. 
His army is between nine and ten thousand, being 
joined by some of the regiments from the West Indies, 
and having fallen in with part of the Highland troops in 
his passage. He has landed his men on Staten Island, 
which they mean to secure, and is in daily expectation 
of the arrival of Lord Howe, with one hundred and 
fifty ships, and a large and powerful reinforcement. 
This we liave from four prisoners, who fell into our 
hands, and some deserters. They add that nothing 
will be attempted until his arrival. Their intelligence I 
have no doubt is well founded; indeed the enemy's 
having done nothing yet affords proof beyond question, 
that they are waiting for more troops. We are strength- 
ening ourselves as much as possible, and deem their 
staying out so long a fortunate circumstance, as it not 
only gives us an opportunity of advancing our works, 
but of getting some .relief from the neighbouring provin- 
ces. From every appearance, they mean to make a 
most vigorous push to subdue us this campaign; and 
for that purpose to possess themselves of this colony, 
if possible, as a step leading to it. Our utmost exer- 
tions must be used, and I trust, through the favor of 
divine Providence, they will be disappointed in their 
views. 

It being evident that an attempt will be made by 



harmony with each oUier, till the decision should be received. The 
instructions of General Gates were too explicit to raise a doubt in any 
other mind tlian his own, and Congress decided against his pretensions. 
He was probably the more bold in claiming the command, as there was a 
party in Congress, particularly among tlie New England delegates, well 
disposed to sustain him in it. Mr. Gerry wrote to him on the 24lh of 
August, " We want very much to see you with the sole command in the 
northern department, but hope you will not relinquish your exertions, un- 
til a favorable opportunity shall effect it."

General Burgoyne to penetrate and make an impression 
into the colonies by way of the lakes, unless there is a 
sufficient force to oppose him, I have exercised a dis- 
cretionary power, with which I was honored by Con- 
gress, and ordered three of the fullest Continental 
regiments, that were stationed in the Massachusetts 
government, to march immediately on receiving my 
orders to join the northern army. I have directed them 
to come to Norwich, and there embark for Albany, 
hoping they will arrive as expeditiously in this way, and 
with much less fatigue, than if they had pursued their 
route by land altogether. These, with such militia as 
may be furnished from the several colonies required to 
provide them, and the troops that were under General 
Sullivan in Canada, I flatter myself will be able and 
more than equal to repel any invasion, that may be at- 
tempted from that quarter. It will be some time be- 
fore their aid can be available, as I have never had the 
authority of Congress to order them until within this 
week. 

You will perceive by the enclosed Declaration, that 
Congress of late have been deliberating on matters 
of the utmost importance. Impelled by necessity, and 
a repetition of injuries no longer sufterable, and being 
without the most distant prospect of rehef, they have 
asserted the claims of the colonies to the rights of hu- 
manity, absolved them from all allegiance to the British 
crown, and declared them Free and Independent States. 
In obedience to their order, the same must be pro- 
claimed throughout the northern army. 

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New Ynrl<, 11 July, l/TC. 

Sir, 

In my letter of yesterday, I mentioned the arrival 
of part of the Connecticut light-horse to assist in the 
defence of this place, and my objection to their horses 
being kept. Fom' or five hundred of them are now 
come in ; and, in justice to their zeal and laudable 
attachment to the cause of their country, I am to in- 
form you, that they have consented to stay as long as 
occasion may require, though they should be at the 
expense of maintaining their horses themselves. They 
have pastured them out about the neighbourhood of 
Kingsbridge, being unwilling to send them away, at 
the rate of half a dollar per week each, meaning to 
leave it entirely with Congress either to allow or refuse 
it, as they shall judge proper. I promised to make this 
representation, and thought it my duty ; and I will only 
observe, that the motives which induced them at first 
to set out were good and praiseworthy, and were to 
afford the most speedy and early succour, which they 
apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. 
Their services may be extremely important, being most 
of them, if not all, men of reputation and of property. 

The subject of the enclosed copy of a letter from 
Governor Trumbull I beg leave to submit to the con- 
sideration of Congress. They will perceive from his 
representation the disquieting apprehensions, that have 
seized on the minds of the people since the retreat of 
the northern army, and how exposed the northern fron- 
tiers of New York and New Hampshire are to the 
ravages and incursions of the Indians. How far it may 
be expedient to raise the battalion he conceives neces-

sary to prevent the calamities and distresses he points 
out, they will determine, upon what he has said, and the 
necessity that may appear to them for the measure.* 
As I am truly sensible the time of Congress is much 
taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with 
unwillingness and pain, that I ever repeat a request after 
having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing 
any opinion of mine after it is once given ; but, as the 
establishing of some office for auditing accounts is a 
matter of exceeding importance to the public interest, I 
would beg leave once more to call the attention of Con- 
gress to an appointment competent to the purpose. 
Two motives induce me to urge the matter ; first, a con- 
viction of the utility of the measure ; secondly, that I 
may stand exculpated if hereafter it should appear, that 
money has been improperly expended, and necessaries 
for the army obtained upon unreasonable terms. 

For me, whose time is employed from the hour of 
my rising till I retire to bed again, to go into an exami- 
nation of the accounts of such an army as this, with any 
degree of precision and exactness, without neglecting 
other matters of equal importance, is utterly impractica- 
ble. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, 
was doing nothing) was, when the commissary, and 



* " The retreat of the northern army and its present situation," said 
Governor Trumbull in the letter referred to, " have spread a general alarm. 
The prevalence of the smallpox among the troops is every way unhappy. 
Our people in general have not had that distemper. Fear of the infection 
operates strongly to prevent soldiers from engaging in the service. The 
retreat of the army from Canada exposes the northern frontiers of New 
York and New Hampshire to the ravages of the Indians, who will doubt- 
less be spirited up to fall upon them. Some of the settlements on Onion 
River, I am informed, are breaking up and removing, and the whole are 
filled with the most disquieting apprehensions. I could wish, that your 
Excellency might think proper to recommend to the Continental Congress 
to order a battalion to be raised and stationed there for the defence of 
those settlements." 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 467 

quartermaster, and director-general of the hospital (for 
it is to these the great advances are made) applied for 
warrants, to make them at times produce a general ac- 
count of their expenditures. But this answers no valua- 
ble purpose. It is the minutiai that must be gone into, the 
propriety of each charge examined, the vouchers looked 
into ; and, with respect to the commissary-general, his 
victualling returns and expenditures of provisions should 
be compared with his purchases ; otherwise a person in 
this department, if he was inclined to be knavish, might 
purchase large quantities with the public money, and 
sell one half of it again for private emolument, and yet 
his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be sup- 
ported with vouchers for every charge. 

I do not urge this matter from a suspicion of any 
unfair practices in either of the departments before men- 
tioned ; and sorry should I be if this construction were 
put upon it, having a high opinion of the honor and 
integrity of these gentlemen. But there should never- 
theless be some control, as well upon their discretion as 
honesty ; to which it may be added, that accounts become 
perplexed and confused by long standing, and the errors 
therein not so discoverable as if they underwent an 
early revision and examination. I am well apprized, 
that a treasury office of accounts has been resolved 
upon, and an auditor-general for setding all public ac- 
counts ; but, with all deference and submission to the 
opinion of Congress, these institutions are not calculated 
to prevent the inconveniences I have mentioned ; nor 
can they be competent to the purposes, circumstanced 
as they are.* 

* Three commissioners were appointed to proceed to New York and 
audit the accounts of the army, and the same number for the army in the 
northern department.

July \2th. — About half after three o'clock this eve- 
ning, two of the enemy's ships of war, one of forty and 
the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed 
anchor in the bay opposite to Staten Island, and, avail- 
ing themselves of a brisk and favorable breeze, with a 
flowing tide, ran past our batteries up the North River, 
without receiving any certain damage that I could per- 
ceive, notwithstanding a heavy and incessant cannonade 
was kept up from our several batteries here, as well as 
from that at Paulus Hook. They, on their part, return- 
ed and continued the fire as they ran by. I despatched 
an express to Brigadier-General Mitflin, at our encamp- 
ment towards the upper end of the island, but I have 
not heard whether they have got by or received any 
damage.* The account transmitted by this morning's 
post, respecting the arrival of one of the fleet, seems to 
be confirmed. Several ships have come in to-day ; 
among them one this evening with a St. George's flag 
at her foretop-mast head, which we conclude to be 
Admiral Howe, from the circumstance of the flag, and 
the several and general salutes that were paid. It is 
probable they will all arrive in a day or two, and imme- 
diately begin their operations. I am, &c. 



* General Howe consulted with the Admiral, July 7th, on the expedien- 
cy of sending a naval force up the North River, with the view of obstruct- 
ing the supplies, which came down the river to New York. The Admiral 
did not at first approve the plan, but at length assented to it, and the 
Phoenix of forty guns, and Rose of twenty, were despatched on this ser- 
vice, with three tenders. On the 6th of August, General Howe informed 
Lord George Germain of this movement, and said that no direct intelli- 
gence had then been received from these vessels, although by private 
means it was ascertained, tliat they had not received the least damage, and 
were in safety near the upper end of Tappan Sea. It is a little remarka- 
ble, that for three weeks no direct intercourse should have occurred be- 
tween these vessels and the fleet ; a proof of tlie vigilance with which the 
American lines were guarded.

ready anticipated the orders of the Comraander-in-chicf, by calling out 
three regiments of militia, as soon as the signals had been given, that the 
enemy's ships were ascending the river. One regiment he stationed at 
Fort Constitution opposite West Point, another at Fort Montgomery, to 
which he repaired in person, and the third at Newburg, ready to be called 
down to the forts below, if occasion should require. He had likewise direct- 
ed several sloops and boats to be assembled at Fort Constitution, with tlie 
design of drawing a chain of them across the narrowest part of the river.

at Fort Montgomery ; and his brotlier, James Clinton, a colonel in the Con-

superintending the construction of the military works in the Highlands. 
No fortifications had as yet been erected at West Point. 

The invasion of the province of New York by the enemy, and the inter- 
nal excitement and trouble caused by the loyalists, had suddenly called home 
from the Continental Congress two delegates, Clinton and Robert R. Liv-

Declaration of Independence. Livuigston was one of the committee, tliat

TO THE SECRET COMMITTEE OF THE CONVENTION OF 



THE STATE OF NEAV YORK.* 



Head-Q,uarters, 13 July, 1776. 

Gentlemen, 
A multiplicity of engagements, and a continual pres- 
sure of Other concerns, have prevented our proceeding 
in the case of the soldiers confined for seditious and 
treasonable practices ; but, as soon as time will admit, a 
proper attention will be paid to it. In the mean time, I 
beg leave to suggest the propriety of the authority of the 
province taking some steps, with regard to the persons 
confined by them for the same offences. They certainly 
are to be deemed the principals, and justice to the inferior 
agents, while the others pass unnoticed, I observe, only 
excites compassion and censure. I am very sensible, that 
it is a case full of difliculty and perplexity, and well de- 
serving your most serious deliberation ; nor do I entertain 
a doubt, but the result will be such, as will conduce to 
the public good. I have, some dme ago, mentioned to 
the body, of which you are a committee, the necessity 
of falling upon some measure to remove from this city 
and its environs persons of known disaffection and en- 
mity to the cause of America. The safety of the army, 
the success of every enterprise, and the security of all, 
depend so much on adopting the most speedy and 
effectual steps for this purpose, that I beg leave again to 
repeat it ; and do most earnestly entreat you to adopt 
some plan for this purpose, or to give me your assistance 

* This Committee was appointed expressly with reference to the 
Tories, or disaffected persons. It was now sitting in the city of New 
York, although the Convention was at White Plains. The title of Pro- 
vincial Congress was changed, on the 9th of July, to that of the Conven- 
tion of the Representatives of the State of JsTew York, immediately after the 
Declaration of Independence had been acceded to by that body. —

in doing it, so as to remove those disquieting and dis- 
couraging apprehensions, which pervade the whole army 
on this subject. A suspicion, that there are many 
ministerial agents among us, would justly alarm soldiers 
of more experience and discipline than ours ; and I 
foresee very dangerous consequences, in many respects, 
if a remedy for the evil is not soon and efficaciously 
applied. 

The removal of the Tory prisoners, confined in the 
gaol of this city, is a matter to which I would solicit 
your attention. In every view, it appears dangerous and 
important. In case of an attack and alarm, there can be 
no doubt what part they would take, and none can tell 
what inlluence they might have. You will. Gentlemen, 
do me the justice to believe, that nothing but the im- 
portance and necessity of the case could induce me to 
urge these matters, in which you have also an immediate 
and common interest.* The gentlemen appointed to 
give passes to persons leaving the city, I am informed, 
dechne acting. Great inconvenience will ensue to the 
cidzens, if this business should be committed to officers 
of the army, who, from their ignorance of the inhabi- 
tants, as well as other reasons, are wholly improper for

ii)g the persons most obnoxious for their principles and conduct, were 
speedily removed by order of the Convention to the jail at Litchtield in 
Connecticut. Tlie crimes alleged against them were those of notorious 
disaffection to tlie rights and liberties of the American States, counterfeit- 
ing the currency of the states, corresponding with the enemy, or engaging 
in treasonable conspiracies. The mayor of the city of New York was 
one of the number, but the President of the Convention wrote to the 
Committee of Litchfield, that though the evidence against him was such, 
as rendered his confinement necessary till he should be tried, yet his 
offences were not of so heinous a nature as those of the other conspira- 
tors, and such indulgence was recommended in his belialf as should be 
consistent with his safe keeping. — MS. Journal of the Mtv York Conven-

TO COLONEL RUDOLPHUS RITZEMA. 

Head-Quarters, M .luly, Iz/d. 

Sir, 
At a period so critical as the present, when our un- 
natural enemies are in full view, and hourly expected to 
strike a blow, which may be supposed in a great meas- 
ure to decide the fate of America, I must confess that I 
am not a little surprised to find an officer of your rank 
in the army soliciting leave to resign his commission, 
more especially considering the predicament you are 
now in. I should rather hope, that, as you are so con- 
scious of your innocence, you would urge an inquiry 
into your conduct, to convince the world, that the 
complaints exhibited against you are totally groundless ; 
and that the malice of your worst enemies cannot do 
the least injury to your reputation, which to a soldier 
ought ever to be dearer than life. I do not know how 
far I can with propriety countermand the order for the 
court of inquiry, as it is already given out in general 
orders ; however, I will think of it, and give you my 
answer to-morrow. I am. Sir, &c. 



to the president of congress. 

Sir, 
General Sullivan, in a letter of the 2d instant, informs 
me of his arrival with the army at Crown Point, where 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 473 

he is Ibrtii'yiiig and throwing up works. He adds, that 
he has secured all the stores except three cannon left 
at Chamblee, which in part is made up by taking a fine 
twelve-pounder out of the Lake. The army is .sickly, 
many with the smallpox ; and he is apprehensive the 
militia, ordered to join them, will not escape the infec- 
tion. An officer, whom he had sent to reconnoitre, had 
reported that he saw at St. John's about a hundred and 
fifty tents, twenty at St. Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; 
and works at the first were busily carrying on. 

About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed, 
that a flag from Lord Howe was coming up, and waited 
with two of our whale-boats until directions should be 
given. I immediately convened such of the general of- 
ficers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in 
opinion, that I ought not to receive any letter directed 
to me as a private gentleman ; but if otherwise, and the 
officer desired to come up to deliver the letter himself, 
as was suggested, he should come under a safe-conduct. 
Upon this, I directed Colonel Reed to go down and 
manage the affair under the above general instruction. 
On his return he informed me, that, after the common 
civilities, the officer acquainted him, that he had a letter 
from Lord Howe to Mr. Washington, which he showed 
under a superscription, " To George Washington, Esq." 
Colonel Reed replied, that there was no such person in 
the army, and that a letter intended for the General 
could not be received under such a direction. The of- 
ficer expressed great concern, said it was a letter rather 
of a civil than military nature, that Lord Howe regretted 
he had not arrived sooner, that he (Lord Howe) had 
great powers. The anxiety to have the letter received 
was very evident, though the officer disclaimed all 
knowledge of its contents. However, Colonel Reed's 
instructions being positive, they parted. After they had 

VOL. III. 60 JVN* 



474 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS, [yEr. 44. 

got some distance, the officer with the flag again put 
about, and asked under what direction Mr. Washington 
chose to be addressed; to which Colonel Reed an- 
swered, that his station was well known, and that cer- 
tainly they could be at no loss how to direct to him. 
The officer said they knew and lamented it ; and again 
repeated his wish, that the letter could be received. 
Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate 
all difficulties, and that this was no new matter, this 
subject having been fully discussed in the course of the 
last year, of which Lord Howe could not be ignorant; 
upon which they parted. 

I would not upon any occasion sacrifice essentials to 
punctilio ; but in this instance, the opinion of others con- 
curring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country 
and my appointment, to insist upon that respect, which, 
in any other than a public view, I would willingly have 
waived. Nor do I doubt, but, from the supposed nature 
of the message, and the anxiety expressed, they will 
either repeat their flag, or fall upon some mode to com- 
municate the import and consequence of it.* 

The passage of the ships of war and tenders up the 
river is a matter of great importance, and has excited 
much conjecture and speculation. To me two things 
have occurred, as leading them to this proceeding ; first, 
a design to seize on the narrow passes on both sides of 
the river, giving almost the only land communication 



* On considering tliis subject, Congress passed the following resolution ; 
— " That General Washington, in refusing to receive a letter said to be 
sent from Lord Howe, and addressed to ' George ff'ashington, Esq.'' acted 
with a dignity becoming his station ; and, therefore, this Congress do 
highly approve the same, and do direct, that no letter or message be re- 
ceived, on any occasion whatsoever from the enemy, by the Commander- 
in-chief, or others, the commanders of the American army, but such as 
shall be directed to them in the characters they respectively sustain." — 
Journals, July 17th.

with Albany, and of consequence with our northern 
army, for which purpose they might have troops con- 
cealed on board, which they deemed competent of 
themselves, as the defiles are narrow; or that they 
would be joined by many disaffected persons in that 
quarter. Others have added a probability of their hav- 
ing a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readiness 
to put into the hands of the Tories immediately on the 
arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to 
make their attack. The second is, to cut off entirely all 
intercourse between this place and Albany by water, 
and the upper country, and to prevent supplies of every 
kind from going and coming. 

These matters are truly alarming, and of such impor- 
tance, that I have written to the Provincial Congress of 
New York, and recommended to their serious consider- 
ation the adoption of every possible expedient to guard 
against the two first ; and have suggested the propriety 
of their employing the militia, or some part of them, in 
the counties in which these defiles are, to keep the en- 
emy from possessing them, till further provision can be 
made ; and to write to the several leading persons on 
our side in that quarter, to be attentive to all the move- 
ments of the ships and the disaffected, in order to dis- 
cover and frustrate whatever pernicious schemes they 
have in view.* 

In respect to the second conjecture of my own, and 

* The ships passed all the batteries without receiving any apparent in- 
jury. The decks were guarded with ramparts of sand-bags, which pro- 
tected the men from small shot ; and the motion of the vessels was so 
rapid, that they remained but a very short time within the range of the 
heavy guns. They ascended to the broad part of the river, called Haver- 
straw Bay, and anchored so far from the shore on either side, as to be out 
of danger. Their boats were daily sent out to take soundings. When 
they occasionally attempted to land, they were beaten back by the militia, 
who watched them narrowly on both sides of the river.

which seems to be generally adopted, I have the pleas- 
ure to inform Congress, that, if their design is to keep 
the armies from provision, the commissary has told me 
upon inquiry, that he has forwarded supplies to Albany 
(now there and above it) sufHcient for ten thousand men 
for four months ; that he has a sufficiency here for 
twenty thousand men for three months, and an abundant 
quantity secured in different parts of the Jerseys for the 
Flying Camp, besides having about four thousand barrels 
of flour in some neighbouring part of Connecticut

WASHINGTON'S APPOINTMENT AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
OF THE AMERICAN ARMY. 

After Congress had determined to embody and support a Con- 
tinental army, it was a matter of much difficulty and embarrassment 
to select a commander, who should be at the same time competent 
to fill that high station, and acceptable to all the colonies. On 
the one hand, the existing army had been raised wholly by the four 
New England provinces, and, to put it under the command of an 
officer of a distant or more southern province, was felt to be an ex- 
periment of delicacy and hazard; on the other hand, it was a thing 
of vital moment to enlist in the common cause the interests of the 
whole continent, and, in effecting so great an object, to sacrifice local 
and party considerations to the higher motives of patriotism and the 
general good. 

Happily the New England delegates in Congress took this latter 
view of the subject, and so far from pressing any claims, w hich might 
be expected from the actual condition of affairs, or interposing any 
obstacles, they were prompt in recommending the choice, upon 
which Congress ultimately decided. The eyes of the public in Mas- 
sachusetts, as well as in other parts of the continent, had already 
been turned upon Colonel Washington, as in all respects the best 
qualified to be placed at the head of the army. On the 4th of June, 
1775, Mr. Gerry, then a member of the Provincial Congress at Wa- 
tertown, wrote to the Massachusetts delegates in the Continental Con- 
gress, — "I should heartily rejoice to see this way the beloved 
Colonel Washington, and do not doubt the New England generals 
would acquiesce in showing to our sister colony Virginia the respect, 
which she has before experienced from the continent, in making him

generalissimo. This is a matter in wliicli Dr. Warren agrees with 
me, and we had intended to write to you jointly on the affair." — 
Austin's IJfe of Gerry, Vol. I. p. 79. Massachusetts and Virginia 
had hitherto taken the lead in bold and decided measures. The 
powerful weight of talents in Virginia, and its comparative impor- 
tance in the scale of numbers and territory, were circumstances not 
to be overlooked, and which pointed to the policy, if not to the ne- 
cessity, of securing the strong attachment of that colony to the cause, 
by recognising its just claims to influence. We hence understand 
the meaning of Washington, in what he says of the political motive, 
which contributed to his election ; and it was a most fortunate coinci- 
dence, that the man, who was preeminently qualified above all others 
for the difficult and responsible duties of commander-in-chief, was a 
native of the province, which stood in the first rank among its com- 
peers, and the cordial cooperation of which was essential. 

The appointment was not made without due reflection and previous 
consultation among the members of Congress. The subject was can- 
vassed in all its bearings, before it was formally introduced in the 
House. The merits of other candidates were amply discussed, and 
the political considerations applicable to each were deliberately 
weighed. The popularity of Charles Lee, and the high opinion en- 
tertained of his military talents and experience, brought him promi- 
nently into view. His foreign birth, however, was an effectual bar to 
his pretensions, as it was a principle, consonant alike to the feelings 
and pride of all parties, that none but a native American should be 
elevated to this place of high dignity and trust. There were other 
officers in the country, older than Washington, some of whom had 
seen service in the last two wars, and who sustained an honorable 
military reputation. These would of course have their friends and 
their advocates ; but local biases and personal attachments were 
gradually yielded up, and the common consent fell upon the indi- 
vidual, who was afterwards selected. In discussing the question 
respecting the army then besieging the British troops in Boston, 
Mr. John Adams made a motion, that it should be adopted by the 
continent, and, in enforcing this motion, he said it was his intention 
to propose for the office of Commander-in-chief a gentleman from 
Virginia, and one of their own body. His remarks on the qualifica- 
tions of this gentleman were so pointed, that they were known to ap- 
ply only to Colonel Washington, who, upon hearing this reference 
to himself, immediately withdrew. The appointment was deferred 
to a succeeding day, when Washington was nominated (as Mr. 
Adams afterwards expressed his belief) by Mr. Thomas Johnson, 



Appendix.] COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. 481 

a delegate from Maryland. Tlie choice was by ballot, and, on 
counting the votes, it was found that he was unanimously elected. 
The House then adjourned till the next day, when the notice of 
his appointment was officially communicated to him by the Presi- 
dent, and he signilied his acceptance in a short and appropriate 

It has usually been stated, that the nommation was made by 
Mr. John Adams, but this is a mistake. No man, probably, was 
more active in bringing about the appointment, than Mr. Adams ; and 
it has been understood, that his influence on the minds of his brethren 
from the eastern colonies was of the most salutary kind, in conduct- 
ing them to harmony of sentiment, and reconciling them to the 
choice of a southern general to command their troops. In this he 
was guided by the same principles of a true patriot, which marked 
his career during the whole revolution. Mr. Johnson had been for 
some years personally intimate with Washington, and on the score of 
policy it was thought advisable, that the nomination should proceed 
from a southern rather than an eastern delegate. Mr. Adams's im- 
pressions may be inferred from a letter written by him to Mr. Gerry, 
three days after the appointment of a commander-in-chief 

" There is something charming to me in the conduct of Washing- 
ton. A gentleman of one of the first fortunes upon the continent, 
leaving his delicious retirement, his family and friends, sacrificing his 
ease, and hazarding all in the cause of his country ! His views are 
noble and disinterested. He declared, when he accepted the mighty 
trust, that he would lay before us an exact account of his expenses, 
and not accept a shilling for pay." — Life of Gerry, Vol. I. p. 90. 

By another part of the same letter it would seem, that Mr. Adams 
had a hard struggle with himself in favoring the introduction of the 
foreign officers, Lee and Gates, into the American service. It is 
probable, that he held these sentiments in common with many other 
persons ; and it is remarkable, that Washington should have been 
himself a chief instrument in promoting two officers, who, at different 
stages of the war, caused him much embarrassment, trouble, and 
pain. 

" I have never in all my lifetime," says Mr. Adams, " suffered 
more anxiety than in the conduct of this business. The choice of 
officers and their pay have given me great distress. Lee and Gates 
are officers of such great experience and confessed abdities, that I 
thought their advice in a council of officers might be of great advan- 
tage to us; but the natural prejudices, and virtuous attachment of our 
countrymen to their own officers, made me apprehensive of difficul-

ties. But considering the earnest desire of General Washington to 
have the assistance of these officers, the extreme attachment of many 
of our best friends in the southern colonies to them, the reputation 
they would give to our arms in Europe, and especially with the min- 
isterial generals and army in Boston, as well as the real American 
merit of both, I could not withhold my vote from either." 

The following is an exact transcript of General Washington's com- 
mission, taken from the original now deposited in the office of the 
Secretary of State at Washinjrton. It varies in some minor particu- 
lars from the one reported by the Committee, and published in the 
Journals of the Old Congress.

GENERAL WASHINGTON'S ARRIVAL IN CAMBRIDGE. 

When the Massachusetts Provincial Congress heard, that General 
Washington had left Philadelphia, and was on his way to take com- 
mand of the army, they appointed a Committee to consider what 
steps were proper to be taken for his reception. In consequence of 
the Committee's report, the following resolves were passed; — 

" Resolved, That Dr. Benjamin Church and Mr. Moses Gill be a 
Committee to repair to Springfield, there to receive Generals Wash- 
ington and Lee, with every mark of respect due to their exalted 
characters and stations; to provide proper escorts for them from 
thence to the army before Boston, and the house provided for their re- 
ception at Cambridge ; and to make suitable provisions for them in the 
manner following, namely, by a number of gentlemen of this colony, 
from Springfield to Brookfield, and by another company raised in 
that neighbourhood from thence to Worcester, and by another com- 
pany there provided from thence to Marlborough, and from thence by 
the troop of horse in that place to the army aforesaid ; and to receive 
the bills of expense at the several inns, where it may be convenient 
for them to stop for refreshment, to examine them, and make report 
of the several sums expended at each of them for that purpose, that 
orders may be taken by the Congress for the payment of them. And 
all innkeepers are hereby directed to make provision agreeably to the 
requests of the said Committee. And that General Ward be notified 
of the appointment of General Washington as Commander-in-chief of 
the American forces, and of the expectation we have of his speedy 
arrival with Major-General Lee, that he, with the Generals of the 
forces of the other colonies, may give such orders for their honorable 
reception as may accord with the rules and circumstances of the

485 



army, and the respect due to tlieir rank, without however any ex- 
pense of powder, and without taking the troops from the necessary 
attention to their chity at this crisis of our affairs. 

" Resolved, That the President's liouse in Cambridge, excepting one 
room reserved by the President for his own use, be taken, cleared, 
prepared, and furnished for the reception of General Washington and 
General Lee." 

The Committee accordingly proceeded to Springfield, and per- 
formed the duties here prescribed. The General was escorted by a 
troop of horse from Brookfield, and several private gentlemen from 
Worcester and other towns on the route. After he had reached 
Watertown, the following address was presented to him. 

" May it please your Excellency, 

"The Congress of the Massachusetts colony, impres.sed with every 
sentiment of gratitude and re'spect, beg leave to congratulate you on ' 
your safe arrival, and to wish you all imaginable happiness and suc- 
cess in the execution of the important duties of your elevated station. 
While we applaud that attention to the public good, manifested in 
your appointment, we equally admire that disinterested virtue and 
distinguished patriotism, which alone could call you from those en- 
joyments of domestic life, which a sublime and manly taste, joined 
with a most affluent fortune, can afford, to hazard your life, and to 
endure the fatigues of war, in the defence of the rights of mankind, 
and the good of your country. 

" The laudable zeal for the common cause of America, and com- 
passion for the distresses of this colony, exhibited by the great de- 
spatch made in your journey hither, fully justify the universal satis- 
faction we have, with pleasure, observed on this occasion ; and are 
promising presages, that the great expectations formed from your 
personal character, and military abilities, are well founded. We 
wish you may have found such regularity and discipline already es- 
tablished in the army, as may be agreeable to your expectation. 
The hurry with which it was necessarily collected, and the many 
disadvantages, arising from a suspension of government, under which 
we have raised and endeavoured to regulate the forces of this colony, 
have rendered it a work of time ; and though in great measure ef- 
fected, the completion of so difficult and at the same time so neces- 
sary a task is reserved to your Excellency, and we doubt not will be 
properly considered and attended to. 

" We would not presume to prescribe to your Excellency, but, sup- 
posing you would choose to be informed of the general character of

the soldiers, who compose this army, beg leave to represent, that the 
greatest part of them have not before seen service; and although 
naturally brave and of good understanding, yet, for want of experience 
in military life, have but little knowledge of divers things most essen- 
tial to the preservation of health, and even of life. The youth in the 
. . army are not impressed with the absolute necessity of cleanliness in 
J • •■-' their dress and lodging, conliuual exercise, and .strict temperance, to 

preserve them from diseases frequently prevailing in camps; espe- 
cially among those, who, from their childhood, have been used to a 
,' jj_ ^^ ■ laborious life. We beg leave to assure you, that this Congress will, 

at all times, be ready to attend to such requisitions as you may have 
occasion to make, and to contribute all the aid in our power to the 
cause of America and your happiness and ease, in the discharge 
of the duties of your exalted office. 

" Wc most fervently implore Almighty God, that the blessings of 
Divine Providence may rest on you ; ftiat your head may be covered 
in the day of battle ; that every necessary assistance may be afforded ; 
and that you may be long continued in life and health, a blessing to 
mankind."

STATE OF THE ARMY AT CAMBRIDGE WHEN GENERAL 
WASHINGTON TOOK THE COMMAND. 

The warlike preparations of the British authorities in Massachu- 
setts, from the time that the Boston Port Bill went into effect, had 
alarmed the people of that province ; and on the 26th of October, 
1774, the Provincial Congress resolved on measures of defence. 
After recitiiiff in a preamble the cau.ses of siirh a step, among which 
was the collecting of a ibrinidable body of troops in the metropolis, 
-with the express design of executing acts of the British Parliament 
subversive of the Constitution and liberties of the province, they 
recommended to the militia to form themselves into companies of 
minute-men, who should be equipped and prepared to march at the 
shortest notice. These minute-men were to consist of one quarter of 
the whole militia, to be enlisted under the direction of the field- 
officers, and divided into companies, consisting of at least fifty men 
each. The privates were to choose their captains and subalterns. 



Api-endix.] state of THE ARMY. ■1''7 

and these ofRcers were to form the companies into i)atialioiis, and 
choose the ficld-olliccrs to command the same. Hence tlie minute- 
men became a body distinct fiom tlie rest o( tlie militia, and, by be- 
ing more devoted to military exercises, they acquired skill in the use 
of arms. More attention than formerly was likewi.se bestowed on the 
training and drilling ol'the militia. 

But it was not till April 22d, 1775, three days after the affair of 
Lexington and Concord, that any movement was made towards em- 
bodying a regular army. On that day the Massachusetts Congress 
resolved unanimously, that it was necessary for the defence of the 
colony that an army of thirty thousand men should be immediately 
raised and established. It was at the same time resolved, that thir- 
teen thousand six hundred should be raised in Massachusetts, and a 
committee was appointed to devise a plan for the establishment of 
the army. The remainder of the thirty thousand it was expected 
would be furnished by the other New England provinces, and for 
this object letters were addressed to Connecticut, Rhode I?land, and 
New Hamjishire. 

In the mean time, the news of the Lexington battle had gone abroad, 
and the militia from various parts in Massachusetts and New Hamp- 
shire began to assemble around Boston. Within three days several 
companies from New Hampshire had arrived at Medford, and taken 
their station in that place. The Massachusetts militia convened at 
Cambridge. The plan of the new army was soon arranged, General 
Ward was placed at its head, and recruiting orders were sent out. 
To expedite the raising of recruits, any person, who enlisted fifty-nine 
privates, was entitled to the command of a company; and a connni.?- 
sion for commanding a regiment was promised to any one, who could 
procure ten companies to serve under him. It is important to keep 
this feature of the Massachusetts army in mind, while reading the 
letters of Washington during the first part of his command, as it was 
a source of much inconvenience. The chief qualification required 
for an appointment was ability to raise men. It was a means, how- 
ever, of promoting rajjid enlistments. 

The other three colonies agreed to furnish their proportion of 
troops, who were raised and sent forward with as much expedition as 
possible. Those from Coimecticut were under the command of 
Putnam, with the rank of major-general; and those from Rhode Isl- 
and were commanded by Greene, with the same rank. The New 
Hampshire regiments appear to have had no higher commander than 
their colonels. General Ward acted as conmiandcr-in-chief of the 
whole, and obedience was yielded to his orders, though in regard to 



488 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Aitendix. 



tlieir internal rules and discipline, the troops from each colony were 
subject- to their own regulations. No soldiers were enlisted to serve 
longer than to the end of the year, and those from Connecticut and 
Rhode Island to the 1st of December only. General Ward's head- 
quarters were at Cambridge, where there were eight or nine thousand 
men commanded by General Putnam. The right wing was at Rox- 
bury under General Thomas ; and on the left, at Prospect Hill, was 
General Greene with part of the Rhode Island troops, having also m 
his division the New Hampshire regiments at Medford. Massachu- 
setts had organized a regiment of artillery under Colonel Gridley ; 
and there was an artillery company from Rhode Island commanded 
by Major Crane. Large detachments of the troops were constantly 
employed in throwing up fortifications and lines of defence, from 
Mystic River to Dorchester Neck. 

Such was the general state of the army, as to its outlines, arrange- 
ment, and distribution, when General Washington arrived at Cam- 
bridge. The following table, made out from the adjutant's returns on 
the 19th of July, will show what number of troops was present from 
each of the colonies, and the aggregate of the whole army at that 
time.

In addition to these returns, Colonel Gridley's regiment of artillery 
amounted to four hundred and ninety-three officers and privates; 
and Major Crane's company from Rhode Island to ninety-six. 

An army thus constituted could hardly contain within itself the 
elements of uniformity or discipline. There was in reality no other 
bond of union, than a voluntary acquiescence, and no controlling 
head vested with any adequate power to maintain authority. By 
common consent Massachusetts was allowed to take the lead. Not 
only the usual affairs of the army were administered by General 
Ward, but courts-martial were held by his order, and punishments

inflicted. Experience had proved, however, that the oflicers were 
deficient in the requisite qualifications for the rank they sustained, 
which is not surprising, when it is considered upon what principle 
the Massachusetts officers had been commissioned. Several arrests 
and trials had taken place for misconduct or cowardice, even at the 
memorable action of Bunker's Hill. Two days after he arrived in 
Cambridge, Washington received the following impressive letter on 
this subject from Joseph Hawley, then a member of the Massachusetts 
Provincial Congress. 

" Watertown, 5 July, 1775 
" Siu, 

" You were pleased the other day to mention to Colonel Warren 
and me as your opinion, that it was highly probable Gage's troops 
would very shortly attack our army in some part or other. I be- 
lieve your opinion is not ill founded, and I am sure your Excellency 
will be pleased with every intimation, that may in any degree aid you 
in the choice of measures tending to success and victory. Therefore, 
that I may not be tedious, I ask your pardon when I suggest, that 
although in the Massachusetts part of the army there are divers 
brave and intrepid officers, yet there are too many, and even several 
colonels, whose characters, to say the least, are very equivocal with 
respect to courage. There is much more cause to fear, that the offi- 
cers will fail in a day of trial than the privates. I may venture to 
say, that if the officers will do their duty there is no fear of the sol- 
diery. 

" I therefore most humbly propose to your consideration, the pro- 
priety and advantage of your making immediately a most solemn and 
peremptory declaration to all the officers of the army, in general or- 
ders or otherwise as your wisdom shall direct, assuring them, that 
every officer, who in the day of battle shall fully do his duty, shall not 
fail of your kindest notices and highest marks of your favor ; but, ou 
the other hand, that every officer, who on such a day shall act the 
poltroon, dishonor his general, and by failing of his duty betray his 
country, shall infallibly meet his deserts, whatever his rank, connex- 
ions, or interests may be, and that no intercessions on his behalf will 
be likely to be of any avail for his pardon. 

" I know that your Excellency is able to form a declaration of the 
kind conceived in such a style, and replete with such determined 
sentiments and spirit, as cannot fail of begetting a full belief and per- 
suasion in the hearts of such to whom it shall be addressed, that the 
same will be infallibly executed. I am almost certain the measure 
will have the happiest tendency. Sed sapimti verbum sat est. Pray

pardon my prolixity, I never was happy enough to be concise. I am, 
with the greatest respect and deference, your Excellency's most obe- 
dient humble servant. 

■' JosEi-n Hawley." 
" To GiiNKKAL Washimuton." 

It was no doul)t in consequence ot this suggestion and advice, that 
the following order was issued on the 7th of July, after approving the 
decision of the court-martial in the cas^e of Captain John Callender. 

" The General, having made all due inquiries and maturely con- 
sidered this matter, is led to the above determination, not only from 
the particular guilt of Captain Callender, but the fata! consequenccj 
of such conduct to the army, and to the cause of America. Tie now, 
therefore, most earnestly exhorts officers of all ranks to show an ex- 
ample of bravery and courage to their men, assuring them, that buch 
as do their duty in the day of battle, as brave and good officers, shall 
be honored with every mark of distinction and regard, and their names 
and merits be made know n to the General Congress and all America ; 
while, on the other hand, he positively declares, that every officer, be 
his rank what it may, who shall betray his country, and dishonor the 
army and his general, by basely keeping back and shrinking from his 
duty in any engagement, shall be held up as an infamous coward and 
punished as such, with the utmost martial severity ; and no connex- 
ions, interest, or intercessions in his behalf will avail to prevent the 
strict execution of justice." 

Captain Callender was cashiered for his conduct in the battle of 
Bunker's Hill, the charge of cowardice having been sustained against 
him before a court-martial. It is proper to state, however, that, 
whatever may have been the fact in this particular instance, Captain 
Callender afterwards fully vindicated himself from this imputation 
upon his character. " He continued with his corps as a volunteer, 
and desperately e.xposed himself in every -action. At the battle of 
Long Island, the captain and lieutenant of the artillery company, in 
which he served, were shot. He assumed the connnaud, and, refus- 
ing to retreat, fought his pieces to the last. The bayonets of the sol- 
diers were just upon him, when a British officer, admiring his chiv- 
alrous and desperate courage, interfered and saved him." — Swett's 
History of Bunker-Hill Battle, p. 57. He continued in the service 
to the end of the war, and his military reputation remained unsullied. 

The following order was issued the day after General Washington 
took command of the army. 

" The Continental Congress having now taken all the troops of the 



Appendix.] 



STATK OF THE ARMY. 491 



several colonios, which have been raised or which may be hereafter 
raised for tlic su|)port and defence of the liberties of America, into 
their pay and service, they are now the troops of the Umtf.o Prov- 
inces OF NoiiTii America ; and it is hoped, that all distinctions of 
colonics will be laid aside, so that one and the same spirit may 
animate the whole, and tii<' only contest be, who shall render on this 
crrcat and trying occasion the most essential service to the great and 
common cause, in which we are all engaged. It is required and ex- 
pected, that exact discipline be observed, and due subordination 
prevail through the whole army, as a failure in these most essential 
points must necessarily produce extreme hazard, disorder, and con- 
fusion, and end in shameful disappointment and disgrace. The 
General most earnestly requires and expects a due observance of 
those articles of war, established for the govcrnMii ut of the army, 
which forbid profane cursing, swearing, and drunkenness. And in 
like manner he requires and expects of all officers and soldiers, not 
engaged on actual duty, a punctual attendance on Divine service, to 
implore the blessings of Heaven upon the means used for our safety 
and defence." 

Orders conceived in the same spirit, and inculcating the same 
sentiments, were often repeated ; and it is an interesting fact, that, 
through the channel of his daily orders, Washington did not strive 
more earnestly to secure the discipline, than to strengthen the pa- 
triotism and improve the morals of his soldiers. 

A graphic description of the American camp is contained in a 
letter from the Reverend William Emerson, a chaplain in the army, 
written a few days after the arrival of the Commander-in-chief 

" There is great overturning in the camp, as to order and regu- 
larity. New lords new laws. The Generals Washington and Lee 
are upon the lines every day. New orders from his Excellency are 
read to the respective regiments every morning after prayers. The 
strictest government is taking place, and great distinction is made 
between officers and soldiers. Every one is made to know his place 
and keep in it, or be tied up and receive thirty or forty lashes accord- 
ino- to his crime. Thousands arc at work every day from four till 
eleven o'clock in the morning. It is surprising how much work has 
been done. The lines are extended almost from Cambridge to Mys- 
tic River, so that very soon it will be morally impossible for the en- 
emy to get between the works, except in one place, which is sup- 
posed to be left purposely unfortified to entice the enemy out of their 
fortresses. Who would have thought, twelve months past, that all 
Cambridge and Charlestown would be covered over with American 



492 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

camps, and cut up into forts and intrenchinents, and all the lands, 
fields, orchards laid conimon, horses and cattle feeding in the choicest 
mowing land, whole fields of corn eaten down to the ground, and large 
parks of well regulated locusts cut down for firewood and other public 
uses? This, I must say, looks a little melancholy. 

" My quarters are at the foot of the famous Prospect Hill, where 
such great preparations are made for the reception of the enemy. It 
is very diverting to walk among the camps. They are as different in 
their form, as the owners are in their dress ; and every tent is a por^ 
traiture of the temper and taste of the persons, who encamp in it. 
Some are made of boards, and some of sailcloth. Some partly of one 
and partly of the other. Again others are made of stone and turf, 
brick or brush. Some are thrown up in a hurry, others curiously 
wrought with doors and windows, done with wreaths and withes in 
the manner of a basket. Some are your proper tents and marquees, 
looking like the regular camp of the enemy. In these are the Rhode 
Islanders, who are furnished with tent-equipage, and every thing in 
the most exact English style. However, I think this great variety is 
rather a beauty than a blemish in the army." — MS. Letter.

494 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [AprE>niv. 

The above table is condensed from tbe original returns of the 
adjutant-general to tbe Commander-in-chier. These returns, though 
connjionly made at stated times, were necessarily imperfect, on ac- 
count of the fluctuating condition of the army. They embrace such 
troops onlv, as were under the immediate connnand of General 
Washington, and not those that were in the northern or southern de- 
partments, nor the militia acting under the authority of particular 
States, and within the limits of those States. 

On the ;{Oth of March, 1770, after the main body of the army had 
marched to New York, five regiments of Continental troops remained 
in Boston, amounting to two thousand one hundred and sixty-eight 
men ; and there were at the same time six thousand six hundred and 
ninety-eight militia, who were soon disbanded. 

The first returns of militia at New York were made out on the 6th 
of Jul) , and were included in the returns of the Continental army. 
This plan was followed till October 5th, so that it is not easy to tell 
within that period the respective numbers of each. The Continental 
troops, however, averaged from ten to twelve thousand. The aggre- 
gates, to which asterisks arc affixed, include both the Continental 
troops and militia. There seems to be a deficiency in the returns 
for September 28th, as the aggregate is considerably smaller, than in 
the week preceding and the week following. 

Colonel Knox's regiment of artillery was diminished in March, by 
a company left at Boston. It was enlarged again in June, by the 
addition of Captain Hamilton's company of New York artillery. 

The first return of cavalry was on the 28th of September, when 
one hundred and sixty light-horse were returned.

INDIANS. 



During the former wars in America between the English and 
French, it had been customary on each side to solicit aid from the 
Indians, and employ them as auxiliaries. Such had been the uni- 
form practice from the first settlement of the country, and it was to 
be presumed that the same system would be pursued in the revolu- 
tion. Considering the ferocity of these people, and the wild and 
savage manner in which they engaged in all the enterprises of war, 



Appi-.npix.] INDIANS. '^^^ 

it is no wonder (hat the policy of seeking tlioir alliance, or even per- 
mitting their aid, shonid be regarded by every friend of humanity with 
unqualified reprobation. Writers of all partie.s liavo miited in con- 
demning a practice, so unjustifiable in itself, and so hostile to the 
principles of civilization, while at the same time belligerents of all 
parties have continued to follow it, even down to the late war be- 
tween England and the United States. 

It has been usual in America to represent the English as much 
the most censurable on this score in the revolutionary war, and if we 
estimate the amount of deserved censure by the effects produced, this 
opinion is no doubt correct. But such is not the equitable mode of 
judging on the subject, since the principle and intention are cliiefly 
concerned, and not the policy of the measure, nor the success of its 
execution. Taken on this ground, historical justice must award to 
the Americans a due share of the blame. Before the rencounter at 
Lexington and Concord, the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts 
had enlisted in their service a company of minute-men among the 
Stockbridge Indians residing in that colony, and had even written 
the following letter to the Reverend Sanmel Kirkland, a missionary 
to the Indians in the western parts of New York. 

" Concord, 4 April, 1775. 
" Sir, 

" The Provincial Congress have thought it necessary to address 
the sachem of the Mohawk tribe, with the rest of the Six Nations, 
upon the subject of the controversy between Great Britain and the 
American colonies. We are induced to take this measure, as we 
have been informed, that those who are inimical to us in Canada 
have been tampering with those nations, and endeavouring to attach 
them to the interest of those, who are attempting to deprive us of our 
inestimable rights and privileges, and to subjugate the colonies to ar- 
bitrary power. From a confidence in your attachment to the »aiise 
of liberty and your country, we now transmit to you the enclosed ad- 
dress, and desire you will deliver it to the sachem of the Mohawk 
tribe to be communicated to the rest of the Six Nations, and that 
you will use your influence with them to join with us in the de- 
fence of our rights ; but, if you cannot prevail with them to take an 
active part in this glorious cause, that you will at least engage them 
to stand neuter, and not by any means to aid and assist our enemies ; 
and as we are at a loss for the name of the sachem of the Mohawk 
tribe, we have left it to you to direct the address to him in such way 
as you may think proper." 

From this paper it is evident, that the Massachusetts Congress 



496 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

were disposed to engage the Six Nations in the contest, which it was 
foreseen must soon commence. The reason for this step, however, 
must not be overlooked. The leaders in Massacliiisetts had .sent 
emissaries into Canada, instructed to consult with a few friends to 
the American cau.se known to be in that province, and to report such 
information as they should obtain respecting the temper of the people, 
particularly the Canadians, and the designs and movements of the 
English party, as far as they could be ascertained. Letters from 
these emissaries, and other persons in Canada, agreed in the state- 
ment, that secret agents had been sent among the Indians of the Six 
Nations to gain them over and stir them up against the colonists. 
On the strength of this intelligence the Massachusetts Congress sent 
the above letter, and the address accompanying it. The Stockbridge 
Indians were retained in service for some time after the war began, 
and came down and joined the camp at Cambridge. It was likewise 
from apprehensions of the English influence at Quebec on the east- 
ern Indians, that the same Congress wrote to the Penobscot tribe, 
May I.5th, promising them protection, and proposing to enlist and 
take into pay a company of their young men. Captain Lane, who 
went on this service, sent down a chief and three other Indians to 
Watertown, as ambassadors from their tribe to the Congress then 
sitting at that place. — 3IS. Journal of the Pi-ovincial Congress, May 
15th and June 21sf. — Captain Lane's Letter, June 9th. 

It was also rumored, and subsequent events confirmed the sus- 
picion, that Colonel Guy Johnson and Sir John Johnson, who resided 
on the Mohawk River, the latter as Indian Agent under the King's 
appointment, were instigating the Indians in that quarter, and pre- 
paring them for hostilities. But notwithstanding the attempts of 
persons in the British interest to engage the Indians in the quarrel, 
no encouragement was afforded by the Continental Congress to any 
efforts of this kind, on the part of the colonies, till more than a year 
after the contest had begun. Their first plan was that of conciliation 
and neutrality. 

Soon after the meeting of the second Congress, in 1775, the sub- 
ject of the Indians was taken into consideration, and in July three 
Indian departments were constituted, the northern, middle, and 
southern, and commissioners were appointed for each. The duty pre- 
scribed to the connnissioners was to hold councils with the Indians, 
form treaties, and endeavour to keep them in peace. In an address 
sent out at the same time by the Congress to the Six Nations, it was 
stated ; — "We desire you will hear and receive what we have now 
told you, and that you will open a good ear and listen to what we 



Appe>dix.] INDIANS. 497 

are now going to say. This is a family quarrel between us and Old 
England. You Indians are not concerned in it. We do not wish 
you to take up the hatchet against the King's troops. We desire you 
to remain at home, and not join on either side, but keep the hatchet 
buried deep. In the name and behalf of all our people, we ask and 
desire you to love peace and maintain it, and to love and sympathize 
with us in our troubles ; that tlic path may be kept open with all our 
people and yours, to pass and repass without molestation." In con- 
formity with this counsel, a treaty was made with some of the northern 
Indians, but to little purpose. It was not consistent with their nature 
or habits to be in tlie midst of a war, without taking a part on one 
side or the other. Through the influence of the Johnsons and others, 
the Six Nations for the most part adhered to the British. After the 
sanguinary affair at the Cedars, where the savages, under the com- 
mand of a British officer, but as it would seem not under his control, 
murdered several American prisoners, and a threat was given out, 
that the others should share the same fate if any attempt were made 
to rescue them, the Congress openly changed their system. On the 
25th of May, 1776, they resolved, "that it was highly expedient to 
engage the Indians in the service of the United Colonies," and they 
empowered the General to employ in Canada and elsewhere a num- 
ber not exceeding two thousand, offering them a " reward of one 
iiundred dollars for every commissioned officer, and thirty dollars for 
every private soldier of the King's troops, that they should take pris- 
oners in the Indian country, or on the frontiers of these colonies." — 
Secret Journal, May 25fh, June 3d, 17ih. The Congress also au- 
thorized General Washington to employ the Indians of Penobscot, St. 
John's, and Nova Scotia, who had proffered their services. They 
were to receive the same pay as the Continental soldiers, but whether 
any of them ever joined the army, or were ever embodied for that 
purpose, may at least be doubted. 

In short, whatever scheme was pursued at any time in regard to 
the Indians, it may be asserted with truth, that they rendered no es- 
sentia! aid to the cause of the United States during the war. Their 
friendsJiip was seldom sincere, and always cost more than it was 
worth. As the British occupied the frontiers, they had every advan- 
tage in operating upon these people, and it was to be expected, that 
they would understand and profit by this state of things. The In- 
dians fought for pay and plunder. According to their custom of war- 
ring upon each other, they committed ravages and frightful cruelties 
on the border inhabitants, which excited the indignation of the coun- 
try. The l)lame was laid at the door of the British ministry, who 

VOL. III. 63 pp* 



498 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix 

were believed to approve, if not to promote, these acts of barbarity 
and horror, and the impression derived from this source contributed 
not a little to fan the flame of animosity, which had been kindled by 
the original causes of the war. 



No. VI. p. 43. 

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GENERAL CHARLES LEE 
AND GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

General Burgoyne and General Lee had served together in Portu- 
gal, and an intimate friendship of long standing subsisted between 
thein. When the former arrived in Boston, General Lee was at 
Philadelphia, not yet appointed to his command in the American 
army, and he wrote a letter to his friend, filled with invectives against 
the British court and cabinet, setting forth with his usual ability and 
eloquence the injustice of their proceedings in regard to the colonies, 
and explaining his own views of the merits of the contest. This let- 
ter, though written with a warmth approaching to violence, was re- 
ceived in good part, and was answered by General Burgoyne in terms 
of courtesy and kindness, on the 8th of July, after it was known to 
him that General Lee had joined the American camp. In closing 
his letter. General Burgoyne proposed an interview with his friend at 
Brown's house, on Boston Neck, a little within the British advanced 
sentries, pledging his parole of honor for the safe return of General 
Lee, and soliciting the same for himself This invitation General 
Lee was inclined to accept, but, not choosing to do it without the 
sanction of the civil authority, he laid the matter before the Provin- 
cial Congress. 

"Head-Quarters, 10 July, 1775. 

" General Lee presents his respects to the President and gentle- 
men of the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts, and submits to 
their perusal a letter, which he yesterday received from General 
Burgoyne in answer to one, which was read and approved by the 
delegates of this province, and other members of the Continental 
Congress. He begs leave to receive their commands, with respect to 
the proposed interview. If they approve it, he shall be glad to ac- 
cept of it ; if they disapprove, he shall reject it. But if they approve 



Appendix.] GENERAL LEE. 



499 



it, he must rc<iiiest that they will depute some one gentleman of their 
body to accompany General Lee, and be witness of the conversation. 
He desires their answer immediately, as he has engaged lo inform 
General Burgoyne by four o'clock this afternoon whether the inter- 
view is to take place. He will be much obliged to the gentlemen if 
they will return the letter, but if they choose to take a copy he can 
have no objection." 

The Congress appointed a committee to report on tiie subject, and 
after as much deliberation as the shortness of the time would permit, 
they returned the following answer on the same day. 

" Sir, 
" The Congress have perused the letter from General Burgoyne, 
which you were kind enough to submit to their inspection. They 
can have no objection to the proposed interview, from any want of 
the highest confidence in the wisdom, discretion, and integrity of 
General Lee ; but, as the confidence of the people in their generals is 
so essentially necessary to the well conducting of the enterprise in 
which we are engaged, and as a people contending for their liberties 
are naturally disposed to jealousy, and not inclined to make the most 
fivoralile construction of the motives of conduct, which they are not 
fully acquainted with, they beg leave to suggest whether such an in- 
terview might not have a tendency to lessen the influence, which the 
Congress would w ish to extend to the utmost of their power to facili- 
tate the operations of war. The Congress, agreeably to your request, 
and to prevent as far as we are able any disagreeable consequences, 
which may arise from the jealousy of the people on such an occasion, 
have appointed Mr. Elbridge Gerry to attend you at the proposed in- 
terview, if you shall think proper to proceed in it; and, as they do 
not think themselves authorized to counteract the General's inclina- 
tion, they would submit it to his opinion whether the advice of a 
council of war might not be taken in a matter of such apparent 
delicacy." — MS. Journal, July \Wli. 

These hints had their effect on the mind of General Lee, and he 
wrote a complimentary note to General Burgoyne, the next day, de- 
clining the interview. 

When General Lee entered into the service of the United Colonies, 
he represented to Congress, that by such a step he must not only give 
up his half-pay as a British officer, but run the risk of losing a con- 
siderable portion of his private fortune. Whereupon it was resolved, 
" That these colonies will indemnify General Lee for any loss of 
property, which he may sustain by entering into their service." —

GENERAL GAGE'S ANSWER TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" Boston, 13 August, 1775. 
Sir, 
lL^n,C<.j ^vT>. „ rp^ ^^^ g]^i.y ^j. g;^,i]i2ed nations, humanity and war have been 

i,U!U-<^i Ht /^*** - compatible ; and compassion to the subdued is become almost a gen- 
"^^ / , eral system. Britons, ever preeminent in mercy, have outgone com- 

?6^*Vir- inon examples, and overlooked the criminal in the captive. Upon 

these principles your prisoners, whose lives by the law of tlie land 
are destined to the cord, have hitiierto been treated with care and 
kindness, and more comfortably lodged than the King's troops in the 
hospitals; indiscriminately it is true, for I acknowledge no rank, that 
is not derived from the King. 

" My intelligence from your army would justify severe recrimination. 
I understand there are of the King's faithful subjects, taken some 
time since by the rebels, laboring, like negro slaves, to gain their 
daily subsistence, or reduced to the wretched alternative, to perish by 
famine or take arms against their King and country. Those who 
have made the treatment of the prisoners in my hands, or of your 
other friends in Boston, a pretence for such measures, found barbarity 
upon falsehood. 

" I would willingly hope, Sir, that the sentiments of liberality, 
which I have always believed you to possess, will be exerted to cor- 
rect these misdoings. Be temperate in political disquisition ; give 
free operation to truth, and punish those who deceive and misrepre- 
sent ; and not only the effects, but the causes, of this unhappy conflict 
will be removed. Should those, under whose usurped authority you 
act, control such a disposition, and dare to call severity retaliation, to 
God, who knows all hearts, be the appeal for the dreadful conse- 
quences. I trust that British soldiers, asserting the rights of the 
state, the laws of the land, the being of the constitution, will meet all 
events with becoming fortitude. They will court victory with the 
.spirit their cause inspires ; and, from the same motive, will find the 
patience of martyrs under misfortune. 

"Till I read your insinuations in regard to ministers, I conceived 
that I had acted under the King, whose wishes, it is true, as well as 
those of his ministers, and of every honest man, have been to see this 
unhappy breach for ever closed; but, unfortunately for both coun- 
tries, those who long since projected the present crisis, and influence

" Gkoki;!-, WAsniN<iT().v, Esq." 

On receivinirtiiis letter, G<'iieral Wasliin<;lon resolved to adopt tin; 
same mode ot' treatmeiU towards the British |)ris<)ners then in his 
possession, « hich was practised by General Gage. Colonel Reed, 
hi.s secretary, wrote the next day by liis order to the Council of I\Ia.s- 
sacluisetts, directing that tlie officers at Watertown and Cape Ann, 
>vho \\'erc prisoners, should be conlincd in Northampton jail, adding 
that, " as General Gage was resolved to know no distinction of rank 
among onr prisoners in his hands, lie was obliged, contrary to his 
disposition, to observe the same nde of treatment to those gentlemen ; 
to whom it might be proper to explain tlie reasons of a conduct, which 
otlierwise might appear harsh and cruel." Tliis order was immedi- 
ately complied with by the Council, so far as to send away the officers 
to the interior. But for some reason, not now understood, the Gen- 
eral altered his mind in regard to their imprisonment, and his secre- 
tary wrote as follows to the Committee of Northampton. 

" When Captain Knight and the other gentlemen went from hence 
yesterday, it was intended they should be put into the same confine- 
ment as prisoners of a common rank, but some circumstances have 
.since changed this intention ; and I now therefore by direction of his 
Excellency, General Washington, am to acquaint you, that Captain 
Knight and those of liis company, for whom he will engage his and 
their parole of honor not to go out of the limits, wliich you may pre- 
scribe to them, are to be indulged with the liberty of walking about 
your town ; and the General further requests, that every other indul- 
gence and civility consistent with their security may be shown to 
them, as long as they demean themselves with decency and good 
manners. As they have committed no hostility against the people of 
this country, they have a just claim to mild treatment, and the Gene- 
ral does not doubt, that your conduct towards then" will be such, as 
to compel their grateful acknowledgments, that Americans are as 
merciful as they are brave." 

Captain Knight had been recently taken prisoner at Machias, with 
six other officers of subordinate rank.

DR. BENJAMIN CHURCH. 

The case of Dr. Church became a matter of consequence and 
notoriety, rather from the high station which he held in the ranks of 
those, who were leaders in the American cause, than from the sub- 
stance of what was called his traitorous correspondence. He was a 
graduate of Harvard College, and had distinguished himself as a 
writer in prose and verse, on politics and miscellaneous subjects. 
He published a poem called The Choice, another called The 
Times, and Elegies on Mayhcw and Whiteticld, which were 
thought to indicate genius and poetical taste ; and in that curious 
laudatory tribute of Harvard College to the King, entitled Piet.4s lt 
Gratulatio, dictated by the Muses in three languages, Greek, 
Latin, and English, the contribution of Dr. Church was pronounced 
by the critics, as Dr. Eliot informs us, to be the best in the collection. 
His oratorical powers were commended, particularly as displayed in 
an oration commemorative of the fatal 5th of March. His fertile pen 
supplied the newspapers with numerous essays on the political state 
of the times, in which he appeared as the champion of liberty, and a 
strenuous opposer of British encroachments. 

With these claims to consideration, it was natural that he should 
be put forward when the day of trial came. As a member of the 
Provincial Congress he was prominent and active, serving on the 
important committees and trusted as a faithful friend. He was sent 
on a special mission to the Continental Congress, and obtained from 
that body the appointment of surgeon-general to the army. When 
General Washington left Philadelphia, Dr. Church's name was on 
the list of those recommended to him by the Massachusetts delegates, 
as worthy of special confidence ; and he was one of the Committee 
appointed by the Provincial Congress to meet the General at Spring- 
field, and accompany him to Cambridge. 

He discharged the duties of his office in the army with approbation, 
tUl about the 1st of October, 1775, when it was discovered, that he 
had held a correspondence with his brother-in-law in Boston, a Mr. 
Fleming, who adhered to the enemy. The circumstances attending 
this discovery were somewhat remarkable. In the month of July, soon 
after General Washington took command of the army, Dr. Church 
gave a letter to a woman, who was going to Newport, and instructed 
her, when there, to go on board the British vessel in the harbour, com-

iiiuiided by Captiiiu Wallace, and put llie loiter into his hands. A 
letter written at tlic lime by Mr. Ward to General Greene, then at 
Cambridge, will e.Nplain the residt. 

" Providence, iiG September, 1775. C/ 

"Sut, 

" This letter waits upon you by JMr. Maxwell, who goes down to 
Cambridge upon a matter, into which I think the strictest inquiry 
ought to be made. It is in short this. In July last a woman, with 
whom Mr. Wainwood had an acquaintance in Boston, came to his 
house and wanted him to assist her in procuring an opportunity of 
seeing Mr. Dudley or Captain Wallace, and by all her behaviour 
showed that she liad some secret of consequence. He artfully drew 
from her, that she liad been sent from Cambridge with a letter to be 
delivered to either of the persons above named, to be forwarded to 
Boston. It immediately occurred to him, that the letter was proba- 
bly sent from some traitor in our army. Upon which he started every 
ditRculty in the way of her seeing Dudley or Wallace, that he could 
think of, and finally prevailed upon her to entrust him with the de- 
livery of the letter. 

" He kept the adair to himself some time, being at a loss what 
step he should take in it, and at length imparted the secret to 
Mr. Maxwell, who, upon opening the letter, found it written in char- 
acters, which he did not understand. Here it rested until very lately, 
when Mr. Wainwood received a letter from the woman, discovering 
great uneasiness about the letter she had entrusted him with, which 
naturally induced a suspicion, that the writer of ii; ^ill continued his 
correspondence in Boston, and had received information, that the let- 
ter had never been transmitted. Mr. Wainwood and Mr. Maxwell, 
who arc both of them friends to the cause of America, rightly 
judging, that the continuance of such a correspondence might be at- 
tended with the most pernicious consequences to the interest of 
America, thought proper to come to Providence and consult me upon 
it, having prudently kept the matter entirely to themselves. By my 
advice they proceed to Cambridge, to lay it with all the circumstances 
before you. 

" I think it best to introduce Mr. Maxwell to General Washington, 
and for you and the General, with not more than one trusty person 
besides, to consider as to the most prudent measures to discover the 
traitor. Perhaps the first step should be to take up the woman, who 
is now at Cambridge, in so private a way as to create no suspicion ; 
and it is probable, that rewards and punishments properly placed be- 
fore her will induce her to give up the author ; in which case he,

with all liis papers, ought to he instantly sccurotl. If the uoinaii 
should be obstinate, sonic clew may be found from her connexions 
th;it will probably lead to a discovery. But 1 beg i)ardon for under- 
takmg to give my advice in this case, when you, upon the spot, pos- 
sessed of all the circumstances, will be so nmch better able to judge 
of the measures proper to be pursued. As Mr. Wainwood is well 
known to many of the inhabitants of Boston, I have advised him to 
go no further than Dedham, where he may be sent for as soon as it 
shall be thought proper for him to appear. I will only add, that if 
they are happily the means of discovering a treacherous corresiwn- 
dence, carried on by any person of note and trust in our public aflairs, 
they will do a most e.s.sential service to their country, and deserve an 
adequate reward. 1 am, with great truth and esteem, Sir, your most 
obedient and very humble servant, 

"Henry Ward." 

This letter was shown by General Greene to the Commander-in- 
tia '^hicf, together with the suspicious epistle in cipher. The woman 
L^V*-'' ■ was examined, but she refused to name the author, or give any infor- 

> f^TjiA ^"^^ ^ <\.'^ niation on the subject. She at last yielded to threats or persuasion, 

-^ &^^ '^"'^ *^''^ ^'^"^ received the letter from Dr. Church, before she went to 

v«v^^' 5^ Newjwrt. He was immediately arrested and put under guard. 

/ ^ ■ r Meantime the obnoxious epistle was deciphered by the Reverend 

nl"* ' ft-f»vA?^ Samuel West, a learned and eminent divine of that day, who was 

*-* ,.^ ^ then acting as one of the chaplains in the array. The task of deci- 

ij- ^^ J, fw phering was not difficult. The original is now among Washington's 

C fcj'A*''^ W^t " papers. Although the characters are wholly arbitrary, yet as each 

I ifV*^ character stands for a distinct letter in the alphabet, a little patience 

iH* only was necessary to ascertain by repeated experiments a small num- 

ber of the consonants and vowels in the words, which most frequently 
occur in composition. Colonel Porter, assisted by Mr. Gerry, also 
deciphered the letter, after it had been done by Mr. West, and a 
copy thus obtained was sent by Mr. Gerry lo the Massachusetts dole- 
gates in the Continental Congress. But the copy used at the trial of 
Dr. Church, and afterwards published, was the one deciphered by 
Mr. West. 

As soon as Dr. Church found out, that the contents of the letter 
were known, he wrote an incoherent account of the matter to Gene- 
ral Washington, attempting to vindicate himself from any design un- 
friendly to his country. A council of war assembled, at which all 
the generals were present. Dr. Church was summoned, and, when 
the letter in cipher was produced, he confessed it was written by him. 



Ai'i-K.Miix.] DR. BENJAMIN CHURCH. 505 

;iii(l that the siiUstaiice of il wa.s accurately deciphered. lie protested 
that he was innocent, and dcchired that his only motive was to prevent 
the enemy from niakiiisr an attack npon the American lines, in liieir 
pre.senl dangerou.s condition from want of jwwder, by exaggerating 
their strength and resources, and in the hopes of ejecting a speedy ac- 
commodation of the dispnte between tiie two countries. Tiic members 
of the council were not satisfied with his asseverations, and they were 
unanimouslv of the opinion, that lie had carried on a criminal corre- 
spondence. The council moreover decided, tiiat the articles of war did 
not authorize them to inflict an adequate punishment for a crime of 
this nature, and that the case should be referred to Congress. 

Dr. Cliurcli was kept in close custody ; and, as he was a member 
of the Massachusetts General Court, the CoTumander-in-chief sent to 
that body at their request the proceedings of the council and other 
papers. A resolve was passed to bring the delinquent member to 
the bar of the House, and require him to show causae, if he had any, 
why he should not be expelled. Accordingly on a stated day he was 
conducted under guard from Cambridge to Watertown, and exam- 
ined before the House with a good deal of form and ceremony. See 
Journal, Octubir •27tlt. His defence, as written out by himself and 
since published in the first volume of the Massackiisctis ni.-,t(ir'ual 
Collections, is ingenious and able ; but his arguments were not con- 
vincing to his auditors, however much they might be moved by his 
rhetoric and eloquence. He was expelled by a vote of the House, 
and his seat declared vacant. 

A still severer ordeal awaited him in the Continental Congress. 
After considering the case, as laid before them in General Washing- 
ton's letter, they docide<l that Dr. Church should be confined in a jail 
in Connecticut, without the use of pen, ink, or paper, and that he 
should not be allowed to converse with any person, except in the 
hearing of a magistrate of the town, or sherifT of the county. lie 
was accordingly imprisoned at Norwich. In May following his 
friends petitioned Congress for his release from confinement on the 
ground that his health was suffering. This petition was granted, 
upon condition that he should be removed to Massachusetts and be 
put in charge of the Coimcil of that colony, giving his parole with 
sureties in the penalty of one thousand pounds, that he would not 
hold correspondence with the enemy, nor go out of tliat colony with- 
out a licence. He returned, and during the year obtained permis- 
sion to depart for the West Indies. As the vessel in which he sailed 
was never heard of afterwards, it was supposed to have been lost 
at sea.

TliLTc \v;st: a diiTcreiice of opinion as to llie intention^ of Dr. 
Church. His letter contained little, if any thing, which could have 
an injurious effect upon the American cause. His conduct at his 
e.xaniination and trial was said to indicate guilt; and it v.as thought 
inconceivable, tliat a man of his sense and character should resort to 
such shallow means, and employ them in so strange a manner, to at- 
taiii such a purpose as he pretended. It was indubitable, that he 
had held a secret correspondence with the enemy. This act was in 
itself deemed a crime of the deepest die. For this he was con- 
demned and punished. If his designs were innocent, he was unfor- 
tunate ; but the burden of proof lay upon himself; and public justice 
could not be satisfied by his individual assertion, nor by the plea of 
folly or mistake.

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GENERAL GAGE 
AND LORD DARTMOUTH. 

The following extracts from the correspondence between General 
Gage and Lord Dartmouth, while the former commanded in Boston, 
are not more curious than valuable as historical records, which have 
not before been made public. They discover in an especial manner 
the kind and degree of information, upon which the English govern- 
ment proceeded in that eventful crisis; showing alike the strange 
misapprehensions and wavering counsels of the General in America, 
and tlie impracticable aims of the ministry at home. These extracts 
are copied from the original letters. 

OENECAL CA(;i-; TO LOUD DAUTMOIITH. 

" Bustun, 2 NuccmbiT, 1774. — The Americans confide in their 
numbers, and a small force rather encourages resistance than terri- 
fies. If I may venture an opinion in matters of such consequence, I 
should take the liberty to tell your Lordship, that I am confident, if 
the misunderstandings proceed to the last extremity, that to begin 
with an army of twenty thousand strong will in the end save Great 
Britain both blood and treasure. Your Lordship will doubtless re- 
ceive many accoinits of the situation of this country ; this province

witliout courts of justice or legislature, tiie whole couutry in ;i lir- 
ment, many parts of it, I may say, actually in arms and r»!ady to 
unite. Letters from oilier provinces lell us they are violent every 
where, and tiiat no decency is oliserved in any ])iace but New York. 
Great Britain had never more occasion for tirnmcss, wisdom, and 
unanimity." 

"November i^th. — The proceedings of the Continental Congress 
astonish and terrify all considerate men; but though I am confident, 
that many of their resolutions neither can nor will be observed, 1 fear 
they will generally be received, as there does not appear to be reso- 
lution and strength enough among the more sensible and moderate 
people in any of the provinces openly to reject them. This Provin- 
cial Congress [of Massachusetts] has been encouraged by the general 
union, and the readiness shown by the rest of the New England 
provinces to appear in arms at their call, to go the length they have." 

"January If^th, 1775. — The eyes of all are turned upon Great 
Britain ; and it is the opinion of most people, that, if a respectable 
force is seen in the field, the most obnoxious of the leaders seized, 
and a pardon proclaimed for all others, government will come 
otT victorious, and with less opposition than was expected a few 
months ago." • 

LORD DAKTMOUTII TO GENERAL <;AGE. 

"London, Januari/ 'ilth. — The violences committed by those, 
who have taken up arms in Massachusetts, have appeared to me as 
the acts of a rude rabble, without plan, without concert, without con- 
duct; and therefore I think that a small force now, if put to the test, 
would be able to conquer them, with greater probabihty of success, 
than might he expected from a larger army, if the people should be 
suffered to form themselves upon a more regular plan, to acquire a 
confidence from discipline, and to prepare themselves, w ithout which 
every thing must be put to the issue of a single action. 

" In this view of the situation of the King's affairs, it is the opinion 
of the King's servants, in which his Majesty concurs, that the first 
essential step to be taken towards reestablishing government would 
be to arrest and imprison the principal actors and abettors in the 
Provincial Congress (whose proceedings appear in every light to be 
acts of treason and rebellion), if regardless of your proclamation, and 
in defiance of it, they shall presume again to assemble for such re- 
bellious purposes ; and if the steps taken upon the occasion be ac- 
companied with due precaution, and every means be devised to keep 



508 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

the measure secret till the moment of execution, it can hardly fail of 
success, and will perhaps be accomplished without bloodshed. But 
however that may be, I must again repeat, that any efforts on their 
part to encounter a regular force cannot be very formidable, and 
though such a proceeding should be, according to your idea of it, a 
signal for hostilities, yet for tlie reasons I have already given, it will 
surely be better, that the conflict should be brought on upon such a 
ground, than in a riper state of the rebellion. 

" It must be understood, however, of all I have said, that this is a 
matter, which must be left to your own discretion to be executed oi 
not, as you shall, upon weighing all the circumstances, think most 
advisable. It is here considered as the best and most effectual means 
of vindicating the authority of the kingdom. Some attention must 
be given to the consideration of what it may be fit to do with those, 
who shall be made prisoners in consequence of this proceeding ; and 
here I must confess the little hope I have, that, in tl:e present situa- 
tion of things, and the temper of the population, they could be prose- 
cuted to conviction. Their imprisonment, however, will prevent 
their doing any further mischief; and, as the courts of justice are at 
present not permitted to be opened, the continuance of that imprison- 
ment will be no slight punishment. 

" With regard to the state of America in general, affairs there are 
now come to a crisis, in which the government of this country must 
act with firmness and decision. You will be on your guard, and on 
no account suffer the people, at least of the town of Boston, to as- 
semble themselves in arms on any pretence whatever, either of town 
guards or militia duty ; and I the rather mention this, as a report 
prevails, that you have not only indulged them in having such a 
guard, but have also allowed their militia to train and discipline in 
Faneni! Hall. In reviewing the charter of Massachusetts, I observe 
there is a clause, that empowers the governor to use and execute the 
law martial in time of actual war, invasion, and rebellion. The en- 
closed copies of a reply made to me by the attorney and solicitor gen- 
eral contain an opinion, that the particulars stated in the papers you 
have transmitted are the history of an actual and open rebellion in 
that province ; and therefore I conceive, that according to that opinion 
the exercise of that power is strictly justifiable, but the expediency 
and propriety of adopting such a measure must depend upon your 
own discretion under many circumstances, that can only be judged 
of on the spot." 



Appendix.] GAGE'S CORRESPONDENCE. 509 



GENERAL fiACE TO LORD DARTMOUTH. 

" Boston, Fihi-uarii \~lJi. — If tlie Provincial Congress is not to 
be deemed a rebellious meeting, surely some of its resolves are rebel- 
lious, though they affect not to order, but to recommend measures to 
the people, which measures I have learned, from the emissaries I 
have sent through the country, have not been regarded as to the rais- 
ing of money, though they have been training men in several town- 
ships, as they could get them in the humor to assent. I would 
remark concerning this Congress, that though the whole assembly is 
concerned in the criminality of the measure, yet many went, and 
were purposely sent by their towns, to oppose the violent party." 

LORD DARTMOUTH TO GENERAL GAGE. 

" London, April lath. — It would appear necessary and expedient, 
that all fortifications should be garrisoned by the King's troops, or 
dismantled and destroyed ; that all cannon, small arms, and other 
military stores of every kind, that may be either in any magazine, or 
secreted for the purpose of aiding the rebellion, should also be seized 
and secreted, and that the persons of such, as, according to the 
opinion of his Majesty's attorney and solicitor general, have com- 
mitted themselves in acts of treason and rebellion, should be arrested 
and imprisoned. 

" I observed, that in your letter of January 18th, you said, that if a 
respectable force is seen in the field, the most obnoxious of the lead- 
ers seized, and a pardon proclaimed for all others, government will 
come off victorious. The two first of these objects are already pro- 
vided for, and it only remains for me to signify to you the King's 
pleasure, that, if you shall continue to be of opinion, that an offer of 
pardon will be advisable, you do by virtue of the power already given 
to you by his Majesty's special commission, under the great seal for 
pardon for treason and other offences, issue a proclamation within your 
government at such time as you shall judge proper, offering a reason- 
able reward for apprehending the President, Secretary, and any other 
of the members of the Provincial Congress, w hom you shall find to 
have been the most forward and active in that seditious meeting, re- 
quiring all persons who may, in consequence of their resolves and 
exhortations, have appeared in arms to oppose the law, to render 
themselves to the Governor and Couned within a reasonable time, 
and declare, that upon such surrender, and upon taking the oaths of 
allegiance and making such declaration of their obedience, as you 



510 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

shall think proper, they shall receive his Majesty's gracious pardon 
for all treasons they have committed." * 

GENERAL (JAGE TO LORD DARTMOUTH. 

" Boston, May loth. — They have been enlisting among the coun- 
try people as many men as could be collected at forty shillings a 
man ; and we are told they are enlisting them in the other provinces. 
If they proceed in their movements it seems impossible to be long 
before we come again to blows ; and from the beginning I have per- 
ceived it was the wish and design of the leaders here to bring affairs 
to that crisis ; but so to manage it as to bring the rest of the colonies 
to support them. It is astonishing how they have duped the whole 
continent." 

" June 12/Ji. — It has been mentioned to your Lordship, that the 
disaffected generally receive very quick intelligence of what is doing 
at home, and that those, who have committed themselves most noto- 
riously in acts of treason and rebellion, fled upon the arrival of a ship 
from England some days before the Nautilus and Falcon sloops reached 
this place with your despatches. From what has passed, your Lord- 
ship will judge that a plan for rebellion has been long conceived, and 
the people's minds ripened for it, and it is now too open and manriest 
to need the opinion of the law officers. I hear that the rebels, after 
surprising Ticonderoga, made incursions and commenced hostilities 
upon the frontier of the province of Quebec, which will justify Gen- 
eral Carleton to raise bodies of Canadians and Indians to attack them 
in return ; and we need not be tender of calling on the savages, as 
the rebels have shown us the example, by bringing as many Indians 
down against us here as they could collect." t 



" It was in consequence of this letter, that General Gage issued his menio- 
lable Proclamation of the 12lh of June, declaring the opposers of the King's 
government to be in rebellion, offering pardon to such as should imniedialelj' 
lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects, e.^cept 
Samuel Adams aud John Hancock, and publishing and ordering the use and 
exercise of the law martial in the province of Massachusetts. 

1 It is a singular fact, that the first intelligence of the capture of Ticonde- 
roga was communicated to General Gage through a letter from Dr. Joseph 
Warren to Mr. John Scollay, dated May 17th, at Watertown, just one month 
before he was slain at Bunker's Hill. A copy of the letter was procured by 
General Gage and sent by him to Lord Dartmouth. The following is an 
extract. 

" Thus a war is begun, which I have frequently said to you and others 
would, if not timely prevented, overturn the British empire ; but I hope, .after

" Jnuc •i,'>l/i. — Till' success, of wliicli I send )Mur Lorilsliip an 
account l)y the prcscnl (ipiuirtunily, was very necessary in our present 
situntion, anil I wisli most sincerely that it iiad not cost us so dear. 
The number of killed and wounded is fjreator, than our forces can at- 
ford to lose. The officers, wlio were obliged to exert themselves, 
have suffered very much, and we have lost some extremely good ot- 
ficers. The trials we have had show the rebels are not the despica- 
ble rabble too many have supposed them to be, and I find it owing to 
a military spirit, encouraged among them lor a few years past, joined 
with an uncommon degree of zeal and enthusiasm, that they are 
olherwipe. When thev find cover, tliey make a good stand, and the 
country, naturally strong, aflijrds it to them, and they are taught to 
assist its natural strength by art, for they intrench and raise batteries. 
They have fortified all the heights and passes around this town, from 
Dorcliester to Medford or Mystic, and it is not impossible for them to 
annoy the town. * 

" Your Lordship will perceive, that the conquest of this country is 
not easy, and can be effected only by time and perseverance, and 
strong armies attacking it in various quarters and dividing their 
forces. Confining your operations on this side only is attacking in 
the strongest part, and you have to cope with vast numbers. It 
might naturally be supposed, that troops of the nature of the rebel 
army would return home after such a check as they liad got, and I 
hear many wanted to go off, but care has been taken to prevent it ; 
for any man that returns home without a pass is immediately seized 
and sent back to his regiment. In all their wars against the French, 
they never showed so much conduct, attention, and perseverance as 

a full conviction botli of our ability and resolution to maintain our rights, 
Britain will act with that wisdom, which is so absolutely necessary for her 
preservation ; this I most heartily wish, as I feel a warm aficction still for the 
parent state." 

* With this letter was communicated the official account of the battle of 
Bunker's Hill, and a return of the killed and wounded. General Gage was 
recalled in conquence of the disastrous issue of that battle. A despatch had 
been made out for him, just before the news reached England, but not yet 
forwaided, in whicli a sketch of future operations was drawn, and important 
questions put to him, which he was desired to answer. As soon as intelligence 
of the battle arrived, a separate letter was written, August ^d, directing Gene- 
ral Gao-e to hand over the despatch to General Howe, who would succeed hirn 
in the command, and closing with the following words. 

" From llie tenor of your letters, and from the state of affairs after the action 
of the 17th, the King is led to conclude, that you have little expectation of ef- 
fecting any thing further this campaign, and has therefore commanded me to 
sio-nify to you his Majesty's pleasure, that you do, as soon as conveniently may

they do now. I think it my duty to let your Lordship know tlie true 
situation of affairs, that administration may take measures accord- 
ingly. 

" The people's minds are kept so much heated and inflamed, that 
they are always ripe for every thing that is extravagant. Truth is 
kept from them, and they are too full of prejudices to believe it, if 
laid before them, and so blind and bigoted, that they cannot see they 
have exchanged liberty for tyranny. No people were ever governed 
more absolutely, than those of the American provinces now are, and 
no reason can be given for their submission, but that it is a tyranny 
they have erected themselves, as they believe, to avoid greater evils." 

LORD DARTMOUTH TO GENERAL GAGE. 

" London, July \st. — I am to presume, that the measure of send- 
ing out a detachment of your troops to destroy the magazines at Con- 
cord was taken after the fullest consideration of the advantages on 
the one hand, and hazards on the other, of such an enterprise, and 
of all the probable consequences that were to result from it. It is 
impossible for me to reflect upon this transaction, and upon all its 
consequences, without feelings, which, although I do not wish to 
conceal them, it is not necessary for me to express ; but I believe 
every man of candor will agree with me in opinion, that, let the event 
be what it may, the rashness and rebellious conduct of the provincials 
on this occasion evince the necessity, and will manifest to all the 
world the justice of the measures, which the King has adopted for 
supporting the constitution, and in which his Majesty will firmly 
persevere. 



be after you receive this letter, return to England, in order to give his Maj- 
esty exact information of every thing, that it may be necessary to prepare, as 
early as possible, for the operations of the next year, and to suggest to his Maj- 
estv such matters in relation thereto, as your knowledge and experience of the 
service enable you to furnish." 

It will hardly be deemed amiss to state in this place, that the American 
Conirress showed a due degree of sensibility for the loss sustained by the 
nation in the death of General Warren, who fell at Bunker's Hill. .\t the 
same time that they voted to erect a monument to his memory (April Sth, 
1777), they ordered, that his eldest son should be educated at the expense of 
ihe United States. And on the 1st of July, 17S0, they resolved, that the half- 
pay of a major-general, to commence at the time of General Warren's death, 
should be paid out of the national treasury towards the education and mainten- 
ance of his three other children, the same to be continued till his youngest 
child should be of age. It appears by the treasury books, that this money was 
paid for several years after the war.

invested by tlie rebels, there was no longer any reason to doubt of 
the intention of the people of Massachusetts Bay to commit them- 
selves in open rebellion. The other three New England provinces 
have taken the same part, and in fact all America (Quebec, Nova 
Scotia, and the Floridas e.xcepted) is in arms against Great Britain, 
and the people involved in the guilt of levying a war against the King 
in every sense of the expression. In this situation every efTort must 
be made, both by sea and land, to subdue the rebellion." 

GENERAL CAGE TO LORD DARTMOUTH. 

" Boston, July 24th. — A pamphlet published by the Continental 
Congress, called a ' Dtclaratwn of the United Colonies,' has been 
sent in from the rebel camp, copies of which will no doubt be sent 
to England from Philadelphia. They pay little regard to facts, for 
the contents of it are as replete with deceit and falsehood, as most of 
their publications. The rebellion being general, I know of no better 
plan to quell it, than that I mentioned to your Lordship in a former 
letter. This province began it, I might say this town, for here the 
arch-rebels formed their scheme long ago. This circumstance 
brought the troops first here, which is the most disadvantageous place 
for all operations, particularly where there is no diversion of the rebel 
forces, but all are collected into one point. Was this army in New 
York, that province might to all appearance be more easily reduced, 
and the friends of government be able to raise forces to join the 
troops." 

"August 26th.* — The designs of the leaders of the rebellion are 
plain, and every day confirms the truth of what was asserted years 
ago by intelligent people, that a plan was laid in this province, and 
adjusted with some of the same stamp in others, for a total indepen- 
dence, whilst they amused people in England, called the friends of 
America, as well as many in this country, with feigned professions of 
affection and attachment to the parent state, and pretended to be 
aggrieved and discontented only on account of taxation ; that they 
have designedly irritated government by every insult, whilst they art- 
fiiily poisoned the minds of the people and ripened them for insurrec- 
tion. They would still deceive and lull the mother country into a 
belief, that nothing is meant against the nation, and that their quarrel

is only with tlie ministers. But it is lioped, that the nation will see 
through this falsehood and deceit. It matters not who hold the helm 
of the state; the stroke is levelled at the British nation, on whose 
ruins they hope to build their so much vaunted American empire, 
and to rise like a Phoeni.x out of the ashes of the mother country." 

" September 2QtJi. — I am to hope, from the affection I bear to my 
country, that no man in Great Britain or Ireland will be long de- 
ceived by fallacious professions and declarations, but see, through all 
the disguise, that this is no sudden insurrection of America, but a 
preconcerted scheme of rebellion, hatched years ago in the Massa- 
chusetts Bay, and brought to this perfection by the help of adherents 
on both sides of the Atlantic." 

" At Sea, October 15th.* — It will give me pleasure, as I think it 
my duty, to send your Lordship every hint or intelligence, that can 
be of use at this important crisis ; nor am I disposed to do it in a se- 
cret manner, as it behoves every man in such times as these to de- 
clare his sentiments openly. People agree now, that there has been 
a scheme for a revolt from the mother country, long conceived be- 
tween those, who have most influence in the American councils, 
which has been preparing the people's minds by degrees for events, 
that at first view they regarded with horror and detestation. If the 
Boston Port Bill had not furnished a pretext for rebellion, something 
else would have brought it forward. Unfortunately few could believe 
it possible for them to prevail with the people to rise, and to the la.st 
the friends of government assured them it was only threats and men- 
aces, meant to intimidate. Misfortune has arisen from this incre- 
dulity ; for the rebels have been prepared to exercise their plan, while 
the government, not apprehensive of so general a revolt, has been un- 
prepared to oppose it. The conduct of the leaders on the 19th of 
April evinced their intention to begin hostilities, and had they not 
commenced then, they would only have been deferred. Your Lord- 
ship has a perfect idea of the transactions of that day, which were so 
far unlucky, as it put an immediate stop to supplies of every kind. 
Otherwise our magazines would have been better filled. 

" I am convinced, that the promoters of the rebellion have no real 
desire of peace, unless they have a carte blanclie. Their whole con- 
duct has been one scene of fallacy, duplicity, and dissimulation, by 
which they have duped many well inclined people. Your Lordship 
will judge if the last petition of the Congress to the King is to be

signing the command to General Howo.

relied upon; and yet we are told, tlial this potilion was olitained by 
the most moderate of the members with great difficulty and after very 
long debate. There has been much heat and division in the Con- 
gress, and a jealousy of the New En<j;land members; and I am told it 
was owing to jealousy, that Washington was appointed to the com- 
mand of the rebel army, in which there is much discontent. Lee is 
neither respected nor esteemed among them, though it is said, that 
he is supported by tlie Boston rulers in opposition to Washington, 
and that he is for making an attack without delay upon the troops, 
but that the rest think it too desperate an undertaking. The rebel 
forces are well fed, in general ill clothed and badly paid, though 
paper money has been issued to them lately. The credit of tlie 
paper is now kept up by force, and I have not heard that any plan 
has been fixed upon to redeem it. 

" They give out that they expect peace on their own terms, through 
the inability of Britain to contend with them ; and it is no wonder 
that such reports gain credit with the people, when letters from Eng- 
land and English newspapers give so much encouragement to rebel- 
lion. Manv people are of the opinion, that the rebels will not hold 
together another year; but, though the country will be very greatly 
distressed, and the people tired of the work, I will take the liberty to 
say, that from their presumption, arrogance, and encouragement from 
England, we can rely on nothing but our own force to procure even 
decent terms of peace, and that, if it was ever necessary to obtain 
peace through the means of war, it is highly so in the present junc- 
ture. I transmit to your Lordship a packet of letters, that were 
picked out from a number of papers scattered about Cushing's house. 
They contain no intelligence of present transactions, but show the 
nature of the correspondence, that the two Lees, Dr. Franklin, and 
others kept up with the leaders of this rebellion." 

Unable to account fur the concert and unanimity, with which all 
the colonies joined in opposition to the Brhish government. General 
Gage ascribes it to a purpose long settled among the colonists 
to break the bond of allegiance, and set up an independent power. 
This topic we have heretofore considered (Vol. IL p. 496), and shown 
that there was not the slightest foundation for such a supposition, either 
in the history of preceding events, or in the sentiments of the persons, 
who were then leading in the measures of resistance. It was natural, 
perhaps, that he should in this way solve the enigma of the ill success 
and want of foresight, by which his command in Boston had been 
signalized, and thus assign to himself and the ministers some plausi- 
ble reason for his disappointment and failure. The true cause, how- 



516 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

ever, was of quite a different character. It was the same, tliat had 
deceived and misled liis superiors in Great Britain, as well as his 
coadjutors in America ; a total ignorance of the spirit of the Ameri- 
can people, and the actual state of feeling and opinion among them, 
produced by what they deemed the oppressive acts and imperious 
bearing of the British government during the last ten years. This 
ignorance generated a contempt, fatal to accurate observation, blind- 
ing the eyes and perverting the judgment, fruitful of deception and 
false hopes, equally unjustifiable in its origin and mischievous in its 
effects.

MARINE OPERATIONS. 

When General Washington took command of the army, no meas- 
ures had been adopted by Congress for prosecuting a naval war- 
fare. The subject had never been in any shape brought before 
them. Rhode Island fitted out and armed two small schooners in 
June, 1775, which were chiefly intended to protect the waters of 
that colony from the depredations of the enemy's small craft, although 
before the end of the summer one of them was sent to cruise on the 
coast. Connecticut likewise about the same time fitted out one or 
two armed vessels. On the 20th of June the Provincial Congress of 
Massachusetts resolved to provide si.\ armed vessels. — MS. Juurnnl, 
June IQtli. But it appears by General Washington's letter to the 
Continental Congress, that none of them had been got in readiness 
as late as the 12th of October. 

The English army, and the inhabitants of Boston, being entirely 
excluded from any communication with the country, it was necessary 
that all their supplies should come by water, and the multitude of 
small vessels employed for this purpose suggested the idea of provid- 
ing some means of diminishing the enemy's resources by capturmg 
these vessels. The General had received no instructions from Con- 
gress, which authorized him to engage in naval enterprises ; but he 
thought that the powers with which he was vested, by a proper con- 
struction, enabled him to attempt any designs to annoy and distress 
the enemy, which should not operate to the disadvantage of the great 



Appe.vdix.] marine OPERATIONS. 517 

interests entrvisted to him. There being tea captains and sailors in 
tlie army, lie formed the project of employing a select number of 
them on their congenial element, and sent persons to Salem, Beverly, 
Marblchoad, and I'lymouth, to find out and engage for the i)ublic 
service suitable vessels, which could be expeditiously prepared for a 
short cruise. He appointed agents to superintend the necessary 
preparations and furnish supplies, and also to take charge of prizes 
when brought in, and to dispose of them according to such directions 
as they should receive. The first person conmiissioned as a naval com- 
mander, under the authority of the Continental Congress, or rather 
the authority of Washington derived from Congress, was Captain 
Broughton of Marblehead. 

TO CAPTAIN NICHOLSON BROUGHTON. 

Instructions. 

" 1. You, being appointed a captain in the army of the United 
Colonies of North America, are hereby directed to take the command 
of a detachment of said army, and proceed on board the schooner 
Hannah, at Beverly, lately fitted out and equipped with arms, ammu- 
nition, and provisions at the Continental expense. 

"2. You are to proceed, as commander oPsaid schooner, immedi- 
ately on a cruise against such vessels as may be found on the high 
seas or elsewhere, bound inwards and outwards to or from Boston, in 
the service of the ministerial army, and to take and seize all such 
vessels, laden with soldiers, arms, ammunition, or provisions for or 
from said army, or which you shall have good reason to suspect are 
in such service. 

" 3. If you should be so successful as to take any of such vessels, 
you are immediately to send them to the safest and nearest port to 
this camp, under a careful prize-master, directing him to notify mo by 
express immediately of such capture, with all particulars, and there 
to wait my farther direction. 

" 4. You are to be very particular and diligent in yotir search after 
all letters and other papers, tending to discover the designs of the 
enemy, or of any other kind, and to forward all such to me as soon 
as possible. 

" 5. Whatever prisoners you may take, you are to treat with kind- 
ness and humanity, as far as is consistent with your own safety. 
Their private stock of money and apparel is to be given them after be- 
ing duly searched ; and when they arrive at any port, you are to apply

to the Committee, or to any officer of the Coiitiiieiital army stationed 
at such port, tor a guard to bring them up to liead-quarters. 

" G. For your own encouragement, and that of the other officers 
and men, to activity and courage in this service, over and above your 
pay in tlio Continental army, you shall be entitled to one tliird part 
of the cargo of every vessel by you taken and sent into port (military 
and naval stores only excepted, which, with vessels and apparel, are 
reserved for public service), which said third part is to be divided 
among the officers and men in the follov\ing proportions ; to a captain 
six shares ; a first lieutenant five ; a second lieutenant four ; ship's 
master three; steward two; mate one and a half; gunner one and a 
half; boatswain one and a half; gunner's mate and sergeant one 
and a half; privates one share luich. 

" 7. You arc particularly charged to avoid any engagement with 
any armed vessel of the enemy, though you may be equal in strength, 
or may have some small advantage, the design of this enterprise being 
to intercept the supplies of the enemy, which will be defeated by your 
running into unnecessary engagements. 

" 8. As there may be other vessels employed in the same service 
with yourselves, you are to fix upon proper signals, and, your stations 
being settled so as to take the greatest range, avoid cruising on the 
same ground. If you should happen to take prizes in sight of each 
other, the rules, which take place among private ships of war, arc to 
be observed in the distribution of the prize-money. 

" 9. In case of retaking the vessel of any friend to the American 
cause, I will recommend it to such person to make a suitable com- 
pensation to those, who have done such a service ; but such vessels 
are not to be deemed as coming within the directions respecting other 
vessels. 

" 10. You arc to be extremely careful and frugal of your ammu- 
nition, by no means to waste any of it in salutes, or for any purpose, 
but what is absolutely necessary. 

"Given under my hand, at Head-Quarters, Cambridge, this 'id 
day of September, 1775. 

"Georoe W.\SniNGT0N." 

Before the end of October, .six vessels of a small size had Ihm ii 
armed and manned, and sent out to cruise within the Capes. It was 
the design, as expressed in the instructions, to intercept the enemy's 
supplies, and not to seek for encounters with armed vessels. The six 
schooners were commanded by Captains Broughton, Selman, Manly, 
Martindale, Coit, and Adams ; and the names of five of them were 



Am-ENKix.] MARINE OPERATIONS. 519 

the Hiiimah, Harrison, Lee, Washington, Lynch. Several priiies 
were brought in, some of wliich were valuable, particularly one taken 
by Captain Manly, consisting of munitions of war, which was said to 
be worth ten thousand pounds. But, on the whole, the cruises of 
these vessels were not very satisfactory. Some of the officers proved 
incompetent, the men mutinied and caused dililcuhics, and the season 
was unfavorable. Captains Broughton and Selman had been unsuc- 
cessful in their cruise to the St. Lawrence, and had shown but little 
discretion in conducting the enterprise. They sent in several vessels, 
which were restored to the owners, as not being subject to capture. 
Captain Martindale's vessel was taken by the enemy, and himself 
made prisoner. 

At length, on the 1st of Fe1)ruary, 1776, the navy, if so it might be 
called, was formed into a new establishment, being composed of four 
vessels; the Hancock, commanded by Manly as commodore; the 
Warren, Captain Burke ; the Lynch, Captain Ayres ; the Harrison, 
Captain Dyer. The instructions were the same, as those origin- 
ally given to Captain Broughton, with the addition of three ar- 
ticles ; — 

" 1. As Captain Manly is appointed commodore of the four 
schooners now fitted out, he will fix upon proper signals by which 
you may know each other, and you are to obey him as such in all 
cases. If it should happen that a prize is taken in sight of other ves- 
sels, fitted out at the Continental expense, or at the charge of indi- 
viduals, the rules, which take place among private ships of war, are 
to be observed in the distribution of the prize-money. 

"2. You, your officers, and men are, from the date hereof, to con- 
sider yourselves as engaged in the service of the United Colonies, and 
in every respect subject to the rules and regulations formed by the 
Congress for the government of the army, raised for the defence of 
American liberty, or as nearly so as possible, consistent with the dif- 
ference of the land and sea senice. A book of the rules and articles 
you will receive herewith, at tlie end of which, you, your officers, and 
men must subscribe your names. 

" 3. As it is very apparent, that the ill success, which attended the 
major part of the armed vessels in former cruises, was owing to the 
want of industry, and to the inactivity of the off.ccrs who com- 
manded; you will, therefore, take notice, that a fondness to be on 
shore, indolence, and inactivity will meet with their just deserts. 
For, if it appears, that the captain or any of the officers do not exert 
themselves, and do all that they possibly can for their own and the 
public good, they shall be dismissed from the service, and rendered in- 



520 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Apm.ndix. 

capable of seivinw tlit'ir CDUiitiy in any honoral)lc illation liiriaCtcr in 
the army or navy." 

As commodore oftliit* little lleet, Captain Manly sii^^taiTiod and in- 
creased the high reputation lie had already acquired. His valor and 
discretion became the theme of public applause, and so far attracted 
the attention of Congress, that when the navy of the United States 
was organized, he was appointed to the connnand of a frigate. The 
four vessels, put under his connnand in February, were successful ; 
but after the evacuation of Boston, and the march of the army to New 
York, Washington had no more to do with naval affairs. Jlis con- 
duct in this matter received the full approbation of Congress. 



No. XI. p. 130. 
THE BURNING OF FALMOUTH. 

As the burning of Falmouth was apparently a wanton act of power, 
and cruel in its etfects on the people, it caused great indignation 
throughout the Continent. There seemed to be a fatality in the 
British operations at the beginning of the war, which were so con- 
ceived and executed, as to widen the breach, and kindle hostile 
feelings even in the breasts of those, who were then least inclined 
to pursue forcible measures of resistance. 

The ministry have been too much censure<l, however, for these 
early acts of the British officers. It is certain, that neither the affair 
at Lexington and Concord, nor the destruction of Falmouth, was 
approved by the government. It was reported at the time, on the 
authority of Lieutenant Mowat, and history thus records it, that or- 
ders had been is.sued for burning all the seaport towns on the coa.st, 
and this was charged upon the British cabinet. — RanaiihranttT, 
Vol. II. p. 125. But I have .seen the original correspondence be- 
tween the minister and General Howe on this subject, in which the 
former expresses much surprise, that such an act .-^hoidd have been 
committed, and requires, in a lone almost amounting to a reprimand, 
that all the particulars should be forwarded to him for the inspection 
of the Kintr. General Howe wrote tlie following explanation. 

" Before the departure of General Gage, an expedition was con- 
certed by the General and Admiral for the destruction of Cape Ann 
and Falmouth, two seaport towns on the coast to the eastward, that 



Ai-i-F.Nnix.] I\I A R 1 N K O I' K R A T I O N S . 521 

werr distinguished liir llicir opposition to governnicnt. The Can- 
cuaux, and an armed transport, huving a small dctacimicnt of troops 
on board, were sent to execute it. I'Vom circumstances it was tbiind 
inexpedient to make any attack upon Cape Ann ; wlii'reupon they 
proceeded to Fainioutii, which place, after giviii}; timely warning to 
the inhahitants tor tiie removal of tiicmselves and ellects, they de- 
stroyed on tlie 18th of October, burning about five hundred houses 
and fourteen sea vessels, and taking and destroying several others 
without any loss on our part." 

This account was not satisfactory, and, on receiving it. Lord 
George Germain wrote again to General Howe; — " I am lo suppose, 
that Admir;d Graves had good reasons for the step he took to destroy 
the town of Falmouth, and that ho did not proceed to that extremity 
without an absolute refusal on the part of the inhabitants to comply 
with those requisitions, stated in the orders he received from tlie 
Lords of the Admiralty, which, however, does not appear from aiiy 
account of that transaction, which I have seen." 

After the removal of the British army to Halifax, and General 
Howe had leisure to inquire into the matter more at large, he col- 
lected and sent to the minister the following particulars. 

" In obedience to your Lordship's commands for a more explicit 
account of the expedition to Falmouth, which was entrusted to Lieu- 
tenant Mowat of the navy, assisted by a detachment of marines and 
artillery, I have reexamined the officer, who commanded this detach- 
ment, and find that his orders from General Gage were, to embark 
on board several armed vessels, the (Jth October, 1775, and to aid 
and assist Lieutenant Mowat in annoying and destroying all ships be- 
longing to rebels on the coast and in the harbour.s to the eastward of 
Boston : that they first examined the harbour of Cape Ami, and find- 
ing the attack upon it inexpedient, they proceeded lo Falmouth and 
laid the armed vessels before the town on the evening of their arrival, 
after which Lieutenant Mowat sent an officer on shore with a sum- 
mons to the inhabitants to deliver up their arms and annnunition, ac- 
quainting them at the same time, that his order.s directed him to de- 
stroy the town if they did not comply with his demand, of which they 
should be allowed two hours to consider and to remove their women 
and children. 

" Shortly after, three persons deputed by the inhabitants came on 
board, requesting a longer time, and it was agreed to wait their an- 
swer until eight o'clock the next morning; about which hour the 
same persons returned, and reported that the inhabitants were deter- 
mined to await their fate. Within half an hour a signal was made 

VOL. III. 66 KK ' 



522 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

by Lieutenant Mowat, the vessels began a cannonade, and several 
^carcassesjwerc thrown into the town, which set fire to the liouses, 
and in a few liours consumed the greatest part of them. A detach- 
ment was then landed, v.iio completed the destruction and reem- 
barked without loss. The small vessels in the harbour were burnt, 
sunk, or brought away, and the armament returned to Boston the 
5th of November v>'ithout attempting any thing further." 

By this statement it would appear, that Mowat's original instruc- 
tions were to annoy and destroy the shipping in the harliours on the 
coast ; but, from the boldness of his conduct, it is probable that in 
burning the town he acted with the consent, if not by the express or- 
ders of Admiral Graves, who, as Gordon relates, was offended with 
the people of Falmouth on account of the obstructions, which they 
had given to the shipment of masts from that place. Mowat had 
likewise been rudely treated at Falmouth a few months before, in 
consequence of the injudicious zeal and unjustifiable enterprise of 
Colonel Thompson and his adherents in seizing him while on shore ; 
and this circumstance may be presumed to have been the primary 
cause of the rash and unwarrantable exploit of burning the town. 
No part of this reproach can rightfully attach to the British ministry. 
The act had no higher source, than the wounded [iride of a subordi- 
nate officer, coinciding with the hasty resentment of his superior in 
command. In its results, however, nothing could have been more 
unfortunate for the cause of the government. The whole continent 
was roused to indignation at so wanton a deed, new antipathies 
were kindled, and the spirit of resistance became more intense and 
widely diffused.

IMPRISONMENT OF JAMES LOVELL. 

,^ Mr. Lovell was a scholar, and a gentleman of the highest respectabil- 

i- fit. ' 'f-'^ "^ ity. His letter to Washington was dated " Boston Prison, December 
\t U 1 >S 6th." The following is an extract. 

" Charged with ' being a spy and giving intelligence to the rebels,' 
I have been suffering the pains and indignities of imprisonment from

the-29tli of Juno last, witlioul any sort of trial. Captain Balfour, aid- 
de-canip to General Howe, sonic time ago directed tUr^. IjOVcU to tell 
mc, from the Coniinandor-in-chief, that 1 must obtain tlio excliange 
of Colonel Skene and his son, as the only condition of my enlarge- 
ment; and I have waited weeks in a vain liopo of being enabled to 
write with more precision to your Kxcelleney. 

" I have no argument but of a private nature, to make use of upon 
this occasion ; and it is addressed to your Excellency's humanity, 
which I am well satisfied will attend the decision of your wisdom. 1 
myself am reduced to such a risk of life, and my family to such mis- 
eries, by my imprisonment, as to make both objects of compassion to 
all, who are not learnedly barbarous and cruel." 

This letter was referred to a committee of the Continental Con- 
gress ; the subject was considered, and a resolve i)assed, — "That 
Mr. James Lovcll, an inhabhant of Boston, now held a close prisoner 
there, by order of General Howe, has discovered, under the severest 
trials, the warmest attachment to public liberty, and an inflexible fidel- 
ity to his country ; that, by his late letter to General Washington, he 
has given the strongest evidence of disinterested public affection, in 
refusing to listen to terms offered for his relief, till he could be in- 
formed by his countrymen, that they were compatible with their safety 
and honor." — Journcds of Congress, January 5th, 177G. 

In consequence of this resolve. General Washington wrote to Gen- 
eral Howe, on the 30th of January. 
"Sir, 

" I have it in command from the honorable Continental Congress 
to propose an exchange of Governor Skene for Mr. James Lovell and 
family. If the proposition is agreeable, you will please to signify as 
much to me and Mr. Lovell, that he may prepare tor his removal, 
whilst I cause Mr. Skene to be brought to this place. I am. Sir, 
your most humble servant,

"Sir, 
"In answer to your letter of the ;30th ultimo, which was delivered 
with the seal broken, I am to acquaint you, that, having lately dis- 
covered a prohibited correspondence to be carried on by Mr. James 
Lovell, the liberty, which I fully intended to have given him, cannot 
take place. I am. Sir, your most humble servant, 

" W. Howe."

524 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

The particulars of this prohibited correspondence are not ex- 
plained. Mr. Lovell was kept in prison, till the British army evacu- 
ated Boston, and then was taken to Halifax, where he was still held 
in close conlineincnt. By accident ho and Ethan Allen met in the 
same jail. Allen had been a wanderer during his captivity, having 
first been sent from Montreal to England in irons, and then trans- 
ported back to Halifax by way of Ireland and North Carolina. Several 
other Americans were incarcerated in the same apartment. Nothing 
more was done for the release of Mr. Lovell, till the July following, 
when Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, adjutant-general to tlie British 
army, had an interview with General Washington in New York, 
where the subject was renewed, and Colonel Paterson himself, in 
behalf of the British commander, jjroposed his exchange for Governor 
Skene. The case of Allen was also brought forward ; but as he had 
been taken in Canada, the affair was considered as belonging to Gen- 
eral Curleton's department, and General Howe declined any inter- 
lereiice. Both the prisoners were brought to New York, and Mr. 
Lovell was exchanged in November. He was chosen a delegate to 
the Continental Congress from Massachusetts, on the 10th of Decem- 
ber, and reelected for several successive years ; during a large portion 
of which he was chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, an 
important and responsible station.

LORD DRUMMOND. 

Two attempts were made by Lord Drummond to propose a plan of 
reconciliation between Great Britain and the colonics. They were 
both unavailing, and have little claim to notice, except as they ema- 
nated, in one instance at least, from high authority, and involved 
some particulars of interest in the events with which tliey were con- 
nected. The first notice of the matter is contained in a letter from 
Mr. Lynch to General Washington, dated at Philadelphia, January 
16th, 1776, in which he says; — 

"A gentleman well known in Maryland, Lord Drummond, just 
from England, tells me, that he has had many conversations with the 
ministry, and showed me a paper approved by each of them, and 
which he is sure will be supported in both Houses. The substance 
of it is, — America to be declared free in point of taxation and inter- 
nal police ; judges to be approved by the judges of England, and 
commissioned during good behaviour, upon stated and sufficient sup- 
port to be statedly assigned them by the colonies ; all charters to be 
held sacred ; that of Boston to be restored ; Britain to regulate trade 
sub modo; all duties laid for the purpose of regulation to be paid into 
the colony treasury where they arise, applicable to its uses by its own 
legislature, in lieu of which, America shall by duties on such articles 
as will probably keep pace in its consumption with the rise or declen- 
sion of the colony, laid by each legislature by permanent act of As- 
sembly, grant towards the general support of the empire annual sums 
in proportion to five thousand pounds sterling for this colony. As 
this sum is little more than half of what did arise by duties heretofore 
paid in this place, I doubted his information, but was assured, that 
ministry wanted nothing but a show of revenue to hold up to Parlia- 
ment, as they are afraid to propose reconciliation, without saving 
what the stiff old Englishmen call the honor of the nation. His 
Lordship came hither through Halifax, Boston, and New York, 
where I fancy he saw what induced him to hint once or twice at be- 
ginning with a suspension of arms, to which I turned a very deaf ear, 
well knowing that the season of winter is ours, and that much may 
be done by April next. I sincerely wish I had your sentiments on 
these heads. I shall propose them to the consideration of Congress, 
as soon as the most urgent affairs are over. I think tiiey merit it." 



526 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

Three weeks afterwards, wlien Mr. Lynch was in New York, as 
one cf a committee from Congress to consult with General Lee re- 
specting the fortification and defence of that city, he there met Lord 
Drummond, and wrote again to General Washington ; — 

" I mentioned to you some time ago certain propositions, which 
Lord Drummond had been talking to me of General Robertson 
writes to him by Clinton, that he (Clinton) is very desirous of being 
instrumental in bringing about the same end. It is mysterious to me 
how such a man should be sent on such an errand. Be it as it may, 
it will not produce any remission of our using the present moment to 
strenuthen ourselves and weaken our enemies. Lord Drummond's 
great point is to get some member of Congress to go home, to inform 
the cabinet of the real desires and intentions of that body respecting 
the reestablishment of peace. To promote this purpose he has de- 
sired me to enclose to you a letter, which, after you have read it, if you 
think it can do no harm, you will be so kind as to forward to Robert- 
son, and to send his answer to his Lordship under your cover. Rob- 
ertson will doubtless scud it open to you." 

LOUD DRUMMOND TO GENERAL ROBERTSON. 

" New York, 5 February, 177(3- 
" My Dear Sir, 
"Just as I was sitting down to write to you, I received yours by 
£>>^ /«5"U. X* General Clinton, but have not as yet had an opportunity of seeing 
f him. During the very few months I was with you at Boston, I ex- 

yf '**-» ^ pressed my wish of being able to make known at Philadelphia the 

disposition in England towards an accommodation upon liberal terms, 
and such as were founded in equity and candor. 

" You then concurred with me in thinking, that however much 
those gentlemen, whose province it now is to think for the public, 
might be held up as aiming at a total separation, they had as their 
sole object such a reconciliation, as would give a constitutional secu- 
rity to their children. In this opinion I think we were not deceived. 
From all the conversation I had at Philadelphia with those gentlemen, 
who allow me, I hope, to rank among the number of their friends, I 
have every reason to think them most seriously disposed towards re- 
conciliation I nor am I without hopes of success. Should such an 
event take place, it is not impossible but a deputation from hence 
may be found expedient, and in that case a passport requisite for a 
security against English cruisers. Such a passport must be left 
blank, for filling up names, and sent by the same conveyance that

this passes tlirougli. It will be needless to caution you ajrainst delay. 
My slight acquaintance with General Howe and Admiral Shuldhani 
will furnish you with an apology for not making a more direct appli- 
cation. 

" I continue, my dear friend, yours, &c. 

" Drummond." 

"P. S. Let me guard you against letting this get to the public, till 
we see how far my hopes are well grounded." . C^f^ 

This letter was forwarded to General Washington at Cambridge, i-J^^ 

~vith the view of its being sent by him into Boston, l^ Its extraordinary 

"purport, coming as it did from a person of whom nothing was known 
as a negotiator, induced him to enclose it to Congress, retaining a 
copy only ia his own possession. Congress instructed their President 
to inform the Commander-in-chief, that they highly approved his care 
and attention in stopping Lord Drummond's letter, and entirely con- 
curred with him, in regard to his Lordship's officious and unwarrant- 
able zeal. Hence the letter never found its way to General Robert- 
son, and we hear no more of its author, till we find the Committee of 
Safety in New York exacting from him a parole of honor, that he 
would hold no correspondence directly or indirectly with those, who 
were in arms against the colonies, nor go into any port or harbour 
occupied by the enemy, nor on board their ships. Ilis bearing and 
intercourse had been such, as to excite suspicions of his being too 
intimately concerned with the manoeuvres of Governor Tryon, and 
his friends the Tories. 

Towards the end of April, his Lordship obtained permission of 
the Committee of Safety to visit Bermuda for the benetit of his 
health, but he was not by this indulgence to be released from his pa- 
role. It happened, however, that in going out to sea through the 
Narrows, he found his way on board his Maje.sty's sliip Asia, where 
he communicated with Captain Vandepiit ; and that, on his return, 
three or four months afterwards, he came directly into the harbour of 
New York, which was then thronged with the British fleet, and held 
intercourse with Lord Howe and other officers. Here it was that 
Lord Drummond's desire to become an agent in settling the diff'er- 
ences between the two countries received a new impulse, and he 
drew up a set of articles, which he sent to Lord Howe with the fol- 
lowing note. 

" I take the liberty of sending enclosed the sketch of propositions 
referred to in my late conversation with your Lordship, which propo- 



528 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

sitions I have understood tlie colonies were disposed not many 
months ago to make the basis of a reconciliation to Great Britain." 

Lord Howe considered tlie propositions, and, on returning them, 
said in reply ; — 

" As I think they contain matter, that, on a conference and cool 
discussion, might be wrought into a plan of permanent union, I shall 
with great satisfaction embrace the first opportunity, that may be 
ofTered upon those grounds, to promote so desirable an event." 

A copy of the propositions, and of the correspondence with Lord 
Howe, was transmitted to Washington by Lord Drummond with the 
following letter. 

" 17 August, 1776. 
" Sir, 

" Being deeply interested in the welfare of America, I think it my 
duty to communicate a matter of intelligence, which I flatter myself 
may be rendered conducive to the restoration of a desirable peace. 
And in this view I request your Excellency's permission to land at 
New York, to go directly to Philadelphia, in order to lay the same 
before the General Congress. In the course of a conversation I have 
had with Lord Howe, I perceive that the powers he is vested with, as 
well as his disposition for establishing an equitable and permanent 
peace, are altogether misunderstood by the colonies. For, in conse- 
quence of a sketch of some propositions being offered for his consid- 
eration, he very frankly assured me he was willing to confer upon 
those grounds with any gentleman of the greatest influence in this 
country. 

" As I am at liberty to declare his sentiments, I have the honor to 
enclose for your Excellency's information a copy of my correspon- 
dence with his Lordship, and of the propositions referred to in his 
letter, which are the motives of my present request. Attending in 
the boat to be indulged with your answer, I have the honor to be 
your Excellency's most humble servant, 

" Drummond." 

This letter was immediately answered by General Washington, 
in terms that could not have been flattering to its author, as he 
was charged with a violation of his parole, which was plainly proved 
by his holding correspondence with the enemy, and going on board 
their ships. For this reason Washington added ; — "I find myself 
under the disagreeable necessity of objecting to the mode of negotiat- 
ing proposed, while your Lordship's line of conduct appears so excep- 
tionable." All the papers, however, were submitted to Congress, and 



Appendix.] LORD DRUMMOND. 529 

the decision of that body was made known to Washington by the 
President. 

" Philadelphia, 24 August, 1776. 
" Sill, 

" The late conduct of Lord Drummond is as extraordinary, as his 
motives arc dark and mysterious. To judge the most favorably of 
ills intentions, it should seem, that an overweening vanity has be- 
trayed him into a criminal breach of honor. But whether his views 
were upright, or intended only to mi.slead and deceive, cannot at 
present be a matter of any importance. In the mean time, I have 
the pleasure to acquaint you, that Congress highly approve the man- 
ner in which you have checked the officious and intemperate zeal of 
his Lordship. Whether his designs were hostile or friendly, he 
equally merited the reproof you gave him, and I hope for the future 
he will be convinced, that it is highly imprudent to attract the atten- 
tion of the public to a character, which will only pass without cen- 
sure when it passes without notice. 

" The Congress, having considered the matter thoroughly, are of 
opinion to decline taking any public or further notice of his Lordship, 
or his letters, and particularly as you have so fully expressed their 
sentiments on the subject in your letter to him. 

" I have the honor to be, &c. 

"John Hancock.' 

Thus ended Lord Drummond's proposals to act the part of a nego- 
tiator. He attempted to vindicate himself from the charge of having 
broken his parole, and to explain his conduct, but without success. 
The facts in the case were too obvious and indisputable to be extenu- 
ated by any testimony he produced, or by the mere assertion of honor- 
able motives. When General Lee was a prisoner in New York the 
summer following, he became acquainted with Lord Drummond, and 
was prevailed upon by him to solicit from Washington a reexamina- 
tion of the affair, stating that his Lordship felt wounded at the treat- 
ment he had received, and expressing a conviction of his innocence. 
Washington replied with his usual firmness, that he had thoroughly 
investigated the subject at the time, that he had no disposition to in- 
jure Lord Drummond, that the impression left on his mind was deep 
and decided, and that no circumstances had since come to light, 
which tended to alter his opinion.

EVACUATION OF BOSTON. 

The evacuation of Boston by the Britisli troops, after having held 
possession of the town for eleven months, was a source of no less joy 
in America, than of astonishment in England. Intelligence of this 
event was published by the ministry on the 3d of May, in a short par- 
agraph, which merely announced, that " his Majesty's forces had 
embarked from Boston with the greatest order and regularity, and 
without the least interruption from the rebels," and were destined for 
Halifax. Parliament being then in session, the subject was called up 
by the Duke of Manchester, on the 10th of May, who proposed a mo- 
tion for an address to his Majesty, that he would be pleased to order 
the late despatches of General Howe and Admiral Shuldham to be 
laid before the House of Lords. A long and warm debate ensued, 
in which the ministers were severely censured for the recent occur- 
rences in America. 

The Duke of Manchester said; — "To come now, my Lords, to 
that which has cast the deepest stain on the glory of the British arms, 
to that which must rouse the indignation of all, who feel for her dis- 
grace ; the array of Britain, equipped with every possible essential of 
war, a chosen army, with chosen officers, backed by the power of a 
mighty fleet, sent to correct revolted subjects, sent to chastise a re- 
sisting city, sent to assert Britain's authority, has for many tedious 
months been imprisoned within that town by the provincial army, 
who, their watchful guards, permitted them no inlet to the country, 
who braved all their efforts, and defied all that their skill and abilities 
in war could ever attempt. One way indeed of escape is left ; the 
fleet is still respected ; to the fleet the army has recourse ; and British 
generals, whose names never met with a blot of dishonor, are forced 
to quit that town, which was the first object of the war, the imme- 
diate cause of hostilities, the place of arms, which has cost this na- 
tion more than a million to defend. We are informed of this extraor- 
dinary event by a gazette, published by authority from government, 
in which it is related, that General Howe had quitted Boston ; no 
circumstances mentioned to palliate the event, no veil but that of si- 
lence to cast over the disgrace. But, my Lords, though the govern- 
ment account is short and uncircumstantial, yet private intelligence, 
public report, on which, till it is with authenticity denied, I must 
rely, informs us, that General Howe quitted not Boston of his own 



Appendix.] EVACUATION OF BOSTON. 



531 



free will ; but that a sii))erior oiieniy, by repeated efforts, by extraor- 
dinary works, by the lire of tlieir batterie.'^, rendered the place un- 
tenable." 

The Earl of Suffolk, in defence of the ministry, told the House 
that there was nothing extraordinary in the evacuation o£»Boston, 
that it was not intended to pursue the war in Massachusetts suice the 
disaffection had become general, that orders had been sent out for 
a removal of the troops when the commander should think proper, 
and that he had resolved on this step ten days before it actually took 
place. " The noble Duke," he added, " says there must have been 
a convention between General Howe and the rebel commander, 
which, I do assure his Grace, was by no means the case ; no conven- 
tion, stipulation, concession, or compromise whatever, having been 
made. The General thought proper to shift his pusiiion, in order, 
in the first place, to protect Halifax, and, after that object was se- 
cured, to penetrate by that way into the interior country and pursue 
his future intended operations." The Marquis of Rockingham re- 
plied, after stating certain particulars, which had come through a 
private channel; — "If those accounts are true, of which I have 
very little doubt, your Lordships will perceive, though possibly there 
might have been no formal convention or capitulation signed, which 
I understood was avoided by the generals on both sides for particular 
reasons, that, in whatever manner the business might have been ne- 
gotiated, it had every substantial requisite of a treaty or compromise, 
as much as if it had been ever so solemnly authenticated or sub- 
scribed. The troops were permitted to evacuate the town without 
interruption, because they engaged on the other hand not to burn or 
destroy it, either previous to their departure, or after they had got on 
board their ships." The same sentiments were expressed by Lord 
Shelburne, and other Lords in the opposition, but the minister per- 
sisted, that he had no knowledge or belief of such a matter. 

The facts in the case, however, prove to have been very nearly as 
represented by the Marquis of Rockingham. The inhabitants of 
Boston, fearing the consequences of an attack, as General Hov.'e had 
prepared to set the town on fire in such an event, were very anxious 
to avert a calamity, that would involve them in ruin. An informal 
statement was drawn up, signed by the Selectmen, addressed to no- 
body, but intended for General Washington. An exact transcript 
from the original is here inserted. 

" Boston, 8 March, 177G. 

" As his Excellency General Howe is determined to leave the town 
with the troops under his command, a number of the respectable in-

habitants, being very anxious for its preservation and safety, have 
apphed to General Robertson for this purpose, who at tlieir request 
has communicated the .same to liis Excellency General Howe, who 
has assured him, that he has no intention of destroying the town, un- 
less the troops under his command are molested during their embar- 
kation or at their departure, by the armed force without ; which 
declaration he gave General Robertson leave to communicate to the 
inhabitants. If such an opposition should take place, we have the 
greatest reason to expect the town will be exposed to entire destruc- 
tion. Our fears are (luieted with regard to General Howe's inten- 
tions. We beg we may have some assurance, that so dreadful a 
calamity may not be brought on by any measures without. As a 
testimony of the truth of the above, we have signed our names to this 
paper, carried out by Messrs. Thomas and Jonathan Amory and Peter 
Johonnot, who have at the earnest entreaties of the inhabitants, 
through the Lieutenant-Governor, solicited a flag of truce for this 
purpose. 

" John Scollay, 
" Timothy Newell, 
" Thomas Marshall, 
" Samuel Austin." 

This paper was taken to the lines at Roxbury, and given to Colonel 
Learned, who carried it to head-quarters. He returned, and wrote 
to the messengers, who had been the bearers of it as follows. 

" Roxbury, 9 March, 177G. 
" Gentlemen, 
" Agreeably to a promise made to you at the lines yesterday, I 
waited upon his Excellency General Washington, and presented to 
him the paper handed to me by you, from the Selectmen of Boston. 
The answer I received from him was to this effect; — 'That, as it 
was an unauthenticated paper, without an address, and not obligatory 
upon General Howe, he would take no notice of it.' I am, with es- 
teem and re.spect. Gentlemen, your most obedient servant, 

" Ebenezer Learned." 
" To Messrs. Amory and Johonnot." 

Notwithstanding this apparently uncompromising answer, yet, as 
the paper evidently conveyed the dispositions of General Howe, and 
as Washington could have no wish to destroy the town, but on the 
contrary the strongest motives for preserving it, no direct annoyance 
was afterwards offered to the British troops. Every thing was in

readiness to make an attack at a moment's notice, shonid any symp- 
toms appear during tlie eml)arkation, that harm was intended to tlie 
town. This mutual understanding doubtless saved much destruction 
of property and much bloodshed. 

When the Congress received intelligence of the evacuation of Bos- 
ton, they resolved, "That the thanks of this Congress, in their own 
name, and in the name of the thirteen United Colonies, whom they 
represent, be presented to his Excellency General Washington, and 
the officers and soldiers under his command, for their wise and 
spirited conduct at the siege and acquisition of Boston ; and that a 
medal be struck in commemoration of this great event, and presented 
to his Excellency ; and that a committee of three be appointed to 
prepare a letter of thanks, and a proper device for the medal." The 
committee were John Adams, John Jay, and Stephen Hopkins. 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" Philadelphia, 2 April, 1770. 
" Sir, 

" It gives me the most sensible pleasure to convey to you, by order 
of Congress, the only tribute which a free people will ever consent to 
pay, the tribute of thanks and gratitude to their friends and benefac- 
tors. The disinterested and patriotic principles, which led you to 
the field, have also led you to glory; and it affords no little consola- 
tion to your countrymen to reflect, that, as a peculiar greatness of 
mind induced you to decline any compensation for serving them, ex- 
cept the pleasure of promoting their happiness, they may without your 
permission bestow upon you the largest share of their affections and 
esteem. 

" Those pages in the annals of America will record your title to a 
conspicuous place in the temple of fame, which shall inform posterity, 
that, under your direction, an undisciplined band of husbandmen in 
the course of a few months became soldiers ; and that the desolation 
meditated against the country by a brave army of veterans, com- 
manded by the most experienced generals, but employed by bad men 
in the worst of causes, was, by the fortitude of your troops, and the 
address of their officers, next to the kind interposition of Providence, 
confined for near a year within such narrow limits, as scarely to ad- 
mit more room than was necessary for the encampments and fortifi- 
cations they lately abandoned. Accept, therefore. Sir, the thanks of 
the United Colonies, unanimously declared by their delegates to be 
due to you, and the brave officers and troops under your command ;

and be pleased to communicate to them this distinguished mark of 
the approbation of tlicir country. Tlie Congress liavc ordered a

ished to be presented to you. 

" I have the honor to be, with every sentiment of esteem. Sir, your 
most obedient and very humble servant, 

" John Hancock, President." 

A private letter from Mr. Adams, written at the same time, will 
show the lively interest and the agency, which he took in the affair. 
" Sir, 

" I congratulate you, as well as all the friends of mankind, on the 
reduction of Boston; an event, which appeared to me of so great and 
decisive importance, that, the next morning after the arrival of the 
news, I did myself the honor to move for the thanks of Congress to 
your Excellency, and that a medal of gold should be struck in com- 
memoration of it. Congress have been pleased to appoint me, with 
two other gentlemen, to prepare a device. I should be very happy to 
have your Excellency's sentiments concerning a proper one. I have 
the honor to be, with very great respect. Sir, your most obedient and 

affectionate servant,

The medal, which was struck in Paris, contains on the obverse a 
head of Washington in profile, exhibiting an excellent likeness, and 
around it the inscription ;

On the reverse is the town of Boston in the distance, with a fleet 
in view under sail. Washington and his officers are on horseback 
in the foreground, and he is pointing to the ships as they depart 
from the harbour. The inscription is

GENER.VL SCHUYLER. 

The arlful and insidious attempts, that were made by the Tories, 
and others deceived by the false reports propagated through their 
means, to injure the character of General Schuyler, are the more 
worthy of notice, as they afford an explanation of the succeeding in- 
cidents, which attended the military fortunes of this active and patri- 
otic officer. It should be premised, that the frontiers of the New 
England colonies, particularly New Hampshire and Massachusetts, 
were exposed to the inroads of the enemy from Canada by way of 
Lake Champlain, and tiiat the people of Berkshire county, the New- 
Hampshire Grants, and even in the neighbourhood of Connecticut 
River, looked upon their salvation as depending on a vigorous de- 
fence in that quarter. When they found the whole army, therefore, 
retreating from Canada, and leaving all the upper parts of the Lake 
open to the ravages of the enemy, they were greatly alarmed for their 
own safety, and, in the midst of their murmurs of despair, they were 
ready to throw all the blame upon the commander of the northern 
department, and, in every case of ill success, to discover symptoms of 
criminal neglect, or more criminal treachery, on his part. 

In this humor they were found by the Tories, who participated in 
the schemes of Governor Tryon, and who by their secret emissaries 
fanned the flame of suspicion, till it became general and was openly 
avowed. Committees of towns and districts assembled, and passed 
resolves, expressing distrust of General Schuyler, and insinuating 
weighty charges against his motives and conduct. Resolves of this 
kind were forwarded to Washington, and to the New York Provincial 
Congress. They of course made no impression, for all who were 
acquainted with General Schuyler knew, that there was not a truer 
patriot in America, nor one who labored more earnestly in the cause 
of his country ; yet for his own information it was deemed a duty to 
make known these charges to him in their original shape. To a 
committee of the Provincial Congress, who had been the organ for 
communicating them, he replied ; — 

" I am much obliged to you for having taken prudent measures to 
])revent the evils, that might be occasioned by the scandalous and 
false reports, propagated to prejudice your respectable body and my- 
self with the public. We must bear with the caprice, jealousy, and 
envy of our misguided friends, and pity them. Our Tory enemies we 



536 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

must watch with care and circumspection, and convince our country- 
men by our actions, that we are true sons of Hberty. I have some 
reason to apprehend, that the Tories are not the only ones, that have 
been assiduous in propagating this story. In the district you mention 
are some persons, wlio applied for oflices, which neither the Commit- 
tee nor I could confer. This disappointment chagrins them, and I 
believe they have occasioned the report. I am much obliged to 
Mr. Trumbull for the step he has taken. It is something singular, 
that at the very time I was sending troops to apprehend Tories, to 
whom I am so obnoxious that they would not hesitate to assassinate 
me, the country below should be arming against me as a Tory." 

TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" Fort George. 28 May, 1776. 
" Sir, 

" Your Excellency's letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a copy of 
the infamous libel transmitted to you by the Committee of King's 
district, I received last night. Whilst this was only report, I treated 
it with contempt, without taking any notice of it; but it is now a 
duty, which I owe myself and my country, to detect the scoundrels ; 
and the only means of doing this is by requesting, that an immediate 
inquiry may be made into the matter, when I trust it will appear, that 
it was more a scheine calculated to ruin me, than to disunite and 
create jealousies in the friends to America. Your Excellency will 
therefore please to order a court of inquiry the soonest possible ; for I 
cannot sit easy under such an infamous imputation, since, on this ex- 
tensive continent, numbers of the most respectable characters may not 
know what your Excellency and Congress do of my principles and 
exertions in the common cause. It is peculiarly hard, that at the 
very time that assassins and incendiaries are employed to take away 
my life and destroy my property, as being an active friend to my 
country ; at the very time when I had taken measures and given or- 
ders, some of which are actually e.xecuted, to secure the Tories and 
to send them down to your Excellency, a set of pretended Whigs (for 
such they are that have propagated these diabolical tales) should pro- 
claim me through all America a traitor to my country. 

" May 31sf. — I am informed by persons of good credit, that about 
one hundred persons, living on what are commonly called the New 
Hampshire Grants, have had a design to seize me as a Tory, and 
perhaps still have. There never was a man so infamously scandal- 
ized and ill-treated as I am, and I hope Congress will publicly do me

that justice, which I thank your Excellency for having done me in 
your letter of the 21st, if that respectable body is convinced (of which 
I make no doubt) of my zeal and attachment to the cause of my in- 
jured country. 1 am, dear Sir, ever most sincerely, your Excellency's 
most obedient humble servant, 

" Philip Schuyler." 

By the following letter addressed to General Washington, and ex- 
pressing the sentiments of a public body, it would .seem that there 
were some persons disposed to do justice to General Schuyler, not- 
withstanding the clamor raised against him. 

" Great Banington, 26 May, 1776. 
" Sir, 

" A Convention of the Committees of Berkshire and the parts adja- 
cent have lately, by two expresses, communicated to your Excellency 
their suspicion of a plot being formed for the destruction of these 
United Colonies, by a combination of a number of persons among 
ourselves for that purpose ; with the evidence upon which that sus- 
picion was principally grounded. Amongst other persons accused, 
General Schuyler was one ; whose important station would give him 
peculiar advantages to distress us by withholding support from the 
army in Canada, if he were inimically disposed. The said Conven- 
tion, therefore, took all those methods they could devise, to find out 
the sentiments of the General; and it is with the greatest pleasure 
we are now able to acquaint your Excellency, that the Convention 
are satisfied that their suspicions respecting him were wholly ground- 
less. That there has been a plan forming among our enemies in the 
colonies is beyond doubt, and we hope the whole will be soon brought 
to light ; but that some wicked and designing men have greatly mag- 
nified it, and falsely asserted divers persons of distinction and merit 
to be concerned in it, in order to influence the timid and ignorant, 
and promote jealousies among us, is indisputable. The Committees 
of this town, Sheffield, and Canaan thought it their duty to acquaint 
your Excellency with the above, as perhaps it might have some influ- 
ence upon your orders or conduct relating to these matters ; and they 
have ordered me to inform you accordingly. This goes by express. 
By order of said Committees. I am your Excellency's most obedient 
humble servant, 

" Mark Hopkins." 

A few days after this communication, another was received on the 
same subject, which is interesting chiefly as it exhibits in a condensed

form the charges of the people against General Schuyler, and the 
grounds of their complaint. 

" Address of the Committees of Safety and Inspection for several 
Towns in the County of Berkshire, Massachusetts Bay, border- 
ing on the Colony of New York, and with the Approbation of 
King's District in said Colony. 

" May it please your Excellency, 

" We beg leave to lay before your Excellency the distresses of our 
minds with all humility. Fear of injuring our common cause by 
writing as well as speaking, on the one hand, or by silence on the 
other, has filled us with peculiar concern. The purport of this epistle 
is so delicate, that we write with fear and trembling, lest, when we 
mean to serve our country, we do it an irreparable injury. Purity of 
intention will not always secure us against wrong steps. We beg 
leave to assure your Excellency, that it is our hearty intention to sup- 
port you in the defence of America against the tyranny and usurpa- 
tion of Great Britain to the last extremity, and, if that is the pleasure 
of the Continental Congress, to the building up of a distinct republic 
or American empire. But what has filled our minds with a pe- 
culiar sense of danger to the common cause are the following things, 
which we take to be facts, though we may be deceived as to some of 
them. 

" That General Schuyler has had the superintending oversight 
of our Canadian army; that, after the defeat of December 31st, 
1775, at Quebec, in an attempt to take it by storm, recruits were for- 
warded in the slowest and most dilatory manner ; that our army be- 
fore the walls of duebec, during a long and tedious winter, under- 
went every kind of hardship, and their spirits were broken by being 
neglected ; that about the 4th of May so inconsiderable was the army, 
so miserably provided with provisions and ammunition, in a word, so 
greatly neglected, that it was obliged precipitately to raise the siege, 
and disgracefully to retreat, so as not only to leave those five hundred 
valiant sons of America taken within the walls of Quebec to the 
mercy of our enemies, but an additional number of sick to be dis- 
posed of at their pleasure ; that General Schuyler some time last win- 
ter went on an expedition to subdue the internal enemies of this 
country, collected in arms against the country at Johnstown, and 
after the suppression of the said rebellion, the ringleader, Sir John 
Johnson, was not so much as put under moderate confinement ; that 
the said Sir John Johnson has since collected a number of said en-

emies, as we suppose, and joined some of tlie King's forces in the 
upper forts, and raised a number of Canadians and Indians, and 
come down upon Colonel Bedel's regiment stationed at the Cedars, 
and taken them to a man, not less than about five hundred in num- 
ber, many of whom were shot and otiiers tomahawked in cool blood 
by the insatiable savages, after they were made prisoners ; this we 
have from men of credibility, who were made prisoners at the same 
time, but found means to get away, the Colonel of said regiment be- 
ing necessarily absent at tiie time of said fight ; tiial our army has 
long been in a most deplorable situation in Canada as to provisions 
and intrenching tools, and we view them as in danger of being driven 
wholly out of those territories, which event we have but too mueii 
reason to fear will decide the fate of New England, and be of the 
most dangerous consequence to all the United Colonies; that the 
minds of many officers, soldiers, and others are greatly dissatisfied 
with the conduct of Genera] Schuyler, and have great fears respect- 
ing his fidelity to his country, though they may be wholly without 
foundation, and we find a great backwardness in men to enlist in this 
expedition on this account. 

"God forbid that we should harbour ungrounded jealousies of the 
deliverers, and, in a sense, saviours of our country, or wilfully shut 
our eyes against the greatest dangers. We beg leave to assure your 
Excellency, that we consider all the United Colonies but as one, and 
observe no other distinctions, than those of friends and enemies to 
their country. We indulge no private disgust or resentment ; we- are 
of no faction or party. We wish not to injure the reputation and 
glory of General Schuyler, were it in our power ; we sincerely hope 
his name may be handed down with immortal honor to the latest pos- 
terity, as one of the great pillars of the American cause. AVe must 
not conclude, without assuring your Excellency of the utmost confi- 
dence placed in you by persons of all ranks and conditions, within 
the sphere of our knowledge. We can cheerfully rest in your wis- 
dom under the direction of Him, who ruleth over all, for directing 
the military operations in general through this great continent, in 
conformity with the advice of the Continental Congress. We heart- 
ily pray for success to your arms and salvation to America ; and that 
your disinterested services may meet with a glorious reward. By 
order of the Committee. 

"Asa DouGL.-iss, Chairman." 
" Pittsfield, 7 June, 1776." 

It needs only be added, that some of the above statements are not

entirely accurate, and that, as far as they are so, General Schuyler 
was in no degree censurable for the unfortunate occurrences therein 
enumerated, having done all in his power to provide against them. 
In their historical bearing, however, they are important, when re- 
garded as showing the impressions of the people, and as connected 
with the events of the next year.
