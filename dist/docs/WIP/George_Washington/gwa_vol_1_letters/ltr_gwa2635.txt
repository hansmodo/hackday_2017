<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, 8 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place in less than three hours after I 
wrote you from Colonel Baylor's. Shortly afterwards 
arrived also Colonel Stephen, who gives a worse account, than he related in his letter; but as he is the 
bearer of this, I shall be the less prolix, referring to him 
for particulars. 
</p><p>
I shall set out this evening for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, where I 
expect to be joined by the recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> and 
this place, as soon as they can possibly march that distance ; also, by one hundred men from Prince William 
and Frederic. I have written to Fairfax county, desiring that a troop of horse may hold themselves in 
readiness to march at an hour's warning. So that I doubt 
not, that, with this assistance, I shall be able to repulse 
the enemy, if they are still committing their outrages 
upon the inhabitants. We are at a loss for want of 
almost every necessary, tents, kettles, arms, ammunition^ and cartridge-paper. I hope, as your Honor 
did not send to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> for them, you will, if 
possible, endeavour to get them below, and send them 
</p><p>
ing the necessary orders, and collecting returns of the provisions and 
clothing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and stores at Rock Creek, I proceeded to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, where I arrived on the 14th of September. Thence I went to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and took upon me the command of the troops there, 
issuing the daily orders, and giving such instructions and directions as appeared necessary. Thence to Fort Dinwiddie on Jackson's River. After 
examining the state of things there, I set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and arrived 
on the 2d of October. On the 5th reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> in my way to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. Continued my journey to Colonel Baylor's, where I was 
overtaken by an express sent from Colonel Stephen (commanding at Fort 
Cumberland), informing me that a body of Indians had fallen upon the inhabitants, killed many of them, and destroyed and burnt several of their 
houses. Thereupon I wrote to the Governor, and returned immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>." 
</p><p>
I must again take the liberty of mentioning to you 
the necessity of putting the militia, when they are drawn 
out into actual service, under better regulation than they 
are at present, as well as of putting us under a military 
law. Otherwise we shall only be a burthensome charge 
to the country, and the others will prove its ruin. That 
this may not appear an unmeaning expression, I refer 
you to Lieutenant- Colonel Stephen, who can give you 
some late proofs of their disobedience and inconsistent 
behaviour. 
</p><p>
As these affairs will take some time, I find I cannot 
possibly be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> till the 6th, 7th, or 8th of 
November, when I should be glad to meet a committee, 
in order to settle with them and your Honor some 
points, that are very necessary for the good of the expedition. 
</p><p>
Colonel Stephen has orders to receive some money 
below, that we may be enabled to pay the troops, keep 
them in spirits, and answer such immediate charges as 
cannot be dispensed with, until I come down. I should 
be glad if your Honor would order him to repair therewith (as soon as he has done his business with the committee) to Winchester ; and from thence, with a proper 
guard, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I hope the treasury will 
have a sufficient sum of money prepared against I come 
down, that I may meet with no delay. 
</p><p>
There are about seventy recruits at this place, and I 
left twenty-five at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>. I suppose they are augmented before this time by officers, who, I am sorry to 
say, have paid slight regard to orders, by not being in at 
the time appointed. I am, &,c.
