DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I little expected, when I wrote you last, that I should 
so soon engage in another campaign ; but, in doing it, I 
may be allowed to claim some merit, if it is considered 
that the sole motive, which invites me to the field, is the 
laudable desire of serving my country, not the gratification of any ambitious or lucrative plans. This, I flatter 
myself, will manifestly appear by my going as a volunteer, without expectation of reward, or prospect of 
obtaining a command, as I am confidently assured it is not in General Braddock's power to give me a commission that I would accept. Perhaps by many others the 
above declaration might be construed into self-applause, 
which, unwilling to lose, I proclaim myself. But by you, 
Sir, I expect it will be viewed in a different light, because you have sympathized in my disappointments, 
and lent your friendly aid to reinstate me in a suitable command ; the recollection of which can never be 
lost upon a mind, that is not insensible of obligations, 
but always ready to acknowledge them. 
</p><p>
This is the reason why I am so much more unreserved in the expression of my sentiments to you, than 
I should be to the world, whose censures and criticisms 
often place good designs in a bad light. But, to be 
ingenuous, I must confess I have other intentions in 
writing you this letter ; for, if there is any merit in my 
case, I am unwilling to hazard it among my friends, 
without this exposition of facts, as they might conceive 
that some advantageous offers had engaged my services, 
when, in reality, it is otherwise, for I expect to be a 
considerable loser in my private affairs by going. It is 
true I have been importuned to make this campaign by 
General Braddock, as a member of his family, he conceiving, I suppose, that the small knowledge I have had 
an opportunity of acquiring of the country, Indians, &c., 
is worthy of his notice, and may be useful to him in the 
progress of the expedition. 
</p><p>
I heartily wish a happy issue to all your resolves, and 
am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant 
</p>
