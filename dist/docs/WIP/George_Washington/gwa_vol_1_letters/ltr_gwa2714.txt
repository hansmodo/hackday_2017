<p>
TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 9 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place last night, and was just setting 
out (though very much indisposed), for my own house, 
when I was honored with your obliging favor of the 3d 
instant. 
</p><p>
My last letters would fully inform your Honor of the 
success of his Majesty's arms under General Forbes, of 
the march of the Virginia troops to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and the 
condition, the very distressed condition, of the first regiment. It is needless, therefore, to recapitulate facts, or 
to trouble you further on this head. 
</p><p>
Reason, nay, common humanity itself points out, that 
some respite should be granted to troops returning from 
every toil and hardship, that cold, hunger, and fatigue 
can inflict, and I hope your sentiments correspond wit 
mine. 
</p><p>
If I easily get the better of my present disorder, I 
shall hope for the honor of seeing you about the 25th 
instant. The want of almost every necessary for the 
journey, and the want of my papers requisite to a full 
and final settlement with the country, oblige me to take 
my own house in the way down. 
</p><p>
Those matters, which your Honor has glanced at in 
your letters, have been fully communicated to me. 
That you had not the least share in causing them, I am 
equally well persuaded, and I shall think myself honored 
with your esteem; being, with the greatest respect, 
your most obedient and most obliged humble servant. 
</p>
