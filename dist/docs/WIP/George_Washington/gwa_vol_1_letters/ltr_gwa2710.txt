TO GENERAL FORBES. 
</p><p>
Camp, near Bushy Run, 17 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
After the most constant labor from daybreak till night, 
we were able to open the road only as far as this place, 
about six miles from our last camp. Captain Shelby 
here overtook us, and presented me with your and 
Colonel Bouquet's letters. A junction with Colonel 
Armstrong this morning would have prevented the good 
effects of a fortified camp to-night, and retarded our 
operations a day at least ; for which reason I desired him to march forward this morning at two o'clock, and 
secure himself, as you desired. If he accomplishes that 
work before night, he is to begin opening the road towards me. 
</p><p>
If Indians can ever be of any use to us, it must be 
now, in the front, for intelligence. I beg you will, therefore, order their conductors to bring them at all events. 
</p><p>
Camp, at night. Colonel Bouquet's letter came to 
my hands, just as the bearer was passing by, from 
Colonel Armstrong. I shall punctually observe all its 
directions, although I at the same time confess, that I 
think it would have been much safer and more eligible 
to march briskly forward to our second post, leaving the 
road for Colonel Montgomery to open. We should by 
that means have been a covering party to him, while we 
are fortifying a camp, which may be of great importance 
to the army. Less time would be lost in this way, and 
a straggling front, which will ever happen in expeditious 
cutting, would be avoided ; besides the probable advantage of getting into a secure camp before we should be 
discovered. 
</p><p>
I have opened the road between seven and eight 
miles to day, and am yet three miles short of Colonel 
Armstrong, who marched at eight o'clock. I understand 
by Captain Shelby, who is just come from him, that he 
has not yet begun entrenching his camp, which must 
again retard us to-morrow. Forwarding provisions is 
highly necessary ; hard labor consumes them fast ; but 
all the men are in high spirits, and are anxious to go on. 
</p><p>
I shall be much pleased to see the Indians up, and 
am very glad ta hear that Mr. Croghan is so near at 
hand. The number with him is not mentioned. I wish 
they also were in our front. 
</p><p>
I w r as extremely sorry to hear of your indisposition to 
day, being, Sir, yours, &c. 
</p>
