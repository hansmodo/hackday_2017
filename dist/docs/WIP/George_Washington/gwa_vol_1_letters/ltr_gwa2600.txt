SIR, 
</p><p>
In my last, by Mr. Stewart, I slightly mentioned the 
objection, which many had against enlisting, to wit, not 
knowing who was to be paymaster, or the times for 
payment. It is now grown a pretty general clamor ; 
and some of those, who were among the first enlisted, 
being needy, and knowing it to be usual for his Majesty's soldiers to be paid once a week, or at most every fortnight, are very importunate to receive their 
due. I have soothed and quieted them as much as 
possible, under pretence of receiving your instructions 
in this particular at the arrival of the colonel. 
</p><p>
I have increased my number of men to about 
twenty-five, and dare venture to say, that I should 
have had several more, if the excessive bad weather 
did not prevent their meeting agreeably to their officers' commands. 
</p><p>
We daily experience the great necessity for clothing the men, as we find the generality of those, who 
are to be enlisted, loose, idle persons, quite destitute 
of house and home, and, I may truly say, many of 
them of clothes ; which last renders them very incapable of the necessary service, as they must unavoidably be exposed to inclement weather in their marches, 
and can expect no other than to encounter almost 
every difficulty, that is incident to a soldier's life. 
There are many of them without shoes, others want 
stockings, some are without shirts, and not a few that 
have scarce a coat or waistcoat to their backs. In short, 
they are as ill provided as can well be conceived ; but I 
really believe every man of them, for his own credit's 
sake, is willing to be clothed at his own expense. They 
are perpetually teazing me to have it done, but I am not 
able to advance the money, provided there w r as no risk 
in it, which there certainly is, and too great for me to 
run ; though it would be nothing to the country, as a 
certain part of their pay might be deducted and appropriated to that use. Mr. Carlyle, or any of the merchants 
here, would furnish them with proper necessaries, if 
there was a certainty of any part of their pay being 
stopped to reimburse the expense. 
</p><p>
But I must here in time put a curb to my requests, 
and remember that I ought not to be too importunate ; 
otherwise I shall be as troublesome to you, as the soldiers are to me. Nothing but the necessity of the 
thing could urge me to be thus free ; but I shall no more 
press this affair, as I am well assured, that whatever you 
may think for the benefit of the expedition, you will 
cause to have done. I am, &c. 
</p>
