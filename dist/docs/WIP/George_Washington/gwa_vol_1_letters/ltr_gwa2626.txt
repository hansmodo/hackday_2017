SIR, 
</p><p>
Captain Orme, being confined to his litter, and not 
able to write, has desired me to acknowledge the receipt 
of yours. He begs the favor of you to have the room 
the General lodged in prepared for Colonel Burton, himself, and Captain Morris, who are all wounded ; also, 
that some small place may be had convenient for cooking ; and, if any fresh provision, and other necessaries 
for persons in their condition, may be had, that you will 
engage them. 
</p><p>
The horses, which carry the wounded gentlemen in 
litters, are so much fatigued, that we dread their performance ; therefore, it is desired that you will be kind 
enough to send out eight or ten fresh horses for their 
relief, which will enable us to reach the fort this evening. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but you have had an account of the poor 
gentlemen's death by some of the affrighted wagoners, 
who ran off, without taking leave. I am, Sir, your most 
obedient servant. 
</p>
