TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES, VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 11 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
After a small halt at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, to issue orders 
to the recruiting officers appointed to that rendezvous, 
I proceeded to this place, in order to collect a return of 
the provisions and clothing, that were lodged here ; an 
exact copy of which I herewith send you. I find, after 
the soldiers have their short allowances, there will arise 
great inconveniences, if stores of clothing are not laid in 
to supply their wants ; particularly shoes, stockings, and 
shirts, for these are the least durable and most needed. 
</p><p>
The method I would recommend is, for the country 
to provide these things, and lodge them, or a convenient 
part of them, in the hands of the quartermaster, who 
may be appointed to receive and deliver them to the 
soldiers, by particular orders from their captains, taking 
care to produce these orders and proper vouchers for 
the delivery, each pay-day, when the amount must be 
deducted out of the soldier's pay, who receives them. 
This, I think, will be a means of keeping them always 
provided and fit for duty, and of preventing the officers 
from supplying the men, which is generally attended 
with misunderstandings. It will also be a means of 
discouraging followers of the army from demanding 
such exorbitant prices, as is usually practised on these 
occasions. 
</p><p>
However, I only offer this as the most efficacious 
method I can at present think of. If any more eligible 
one can be found, I should be glad to see it executed, as 
something of the kind must be done, otherwise the soldiers will be barefoot, which is always a plea for exemption from duty ; and, indeed, in the approaching season 
it will be a very just one. You will be a judge, when you see the returns, what had best be done with the 
provisions. The quantity is too great for the present 
consumption, and to wagon it up can never answer the expense. 
</p><p>
Major Carlyle thinks the West India market best, as 
the returns will be in rum, which he can soon turn into flour at the camp. 
</p><p>
I am afraid I shall not be able to push things with 
vigor this fall, for want of a commissary who will act 
with spirit. Mr. Dick seems determined not to enter 
into any further contracts, unless he is better supported, 
or until he meets the Committee in October ; by which 
time the best season for engaging beef will be almost 
over. The Governor, by the advice of Sir John St. Clair, 
expressed, just as I was coming away, his desire of having him continued ; so that I am entirely ignorant how 
to act. The making of contracts myself is foreign to my 
duty ; neither have I time ; and to see the service suffer 
will give me infinite uneasiness, as I would gladly conduct every thing, as far as I am capable, with life and 
spirit. This never can be done unless a fund of money 
is lodged in camp for defraying the contingent charges. 
As I believed it difficult to get all the clothing in any 
one part of the country, I engaged it where I could, and 
have got shoes, stockings, shirts, and hats enough upon 
tolerably good terms, as you may see by the enclosed. 
</p><p>
Major Carlyle is also willing to engage one hundred 
complete suits, as good as those imported, for three 
pounds, or less ; with which I have acquainted the Governor. I believe them to be as cheap as can be got 
below, as it is the making chiefly, that occasions the 
difference between those imported, and those provided 
here. I am, &,c.
