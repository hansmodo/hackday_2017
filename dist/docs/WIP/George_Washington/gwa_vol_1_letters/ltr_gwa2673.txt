DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your two favors 
both of the 22d instant. We were reinforced, upon the 
late alarm, by one hundred and seventy militia from the 
adjacent counties, one half of them unarmed, and the 
whole without ammunition or provisions. 
</p><p>
Had you, Sir, in consequence of Captain Beall's  
suggestions, ordered me to reinforce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
with part of my regiment, I should have given you proof 
of my willingness to obey your commands, by a speedy 
compliance with them ; but since you are so kind as to 
leave it discretionary with me, I freely confess, that I 
cannot entertain any thoughts of parting with the fewsoldiers I have, to strengthen a place that now seems to 
be in no actual danger. Nor can I help observing, that 
I think it a little odd in Captain Beall, after having received subsequent notice of the fallacy of his first intelligence, to intimate that it was reasonable to reinforce 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, at the expense of Virginia, which has 
a frontier to defend thirty times the extent of that of 
Maryland, and this frontier left solely to the protection 
of her few regular troops,
</p><p>
I flatter myself, that the account of an expected attack upon Fort Augusta [in Pennsylvania], will prove 
more favorable, than Colonel Weiser imagines ; for I 
have no conception, that a road fit for carriages can be 
cut within ten miles of a fort, without its being discovered by the garrison. 
</p><p>
The friendship and assistance of the Cherokees are 
well worth cultivating. For my own part, I think them 
indispensably necessary in our present circumstances, 
and am sorry to find such unseasonable delays in bringing them amongst us. Since Captain Croghan left this 
place, Antasity, an Indian warrior of that nation, with 
twenty-seven followers, has arrived here. He brings an 
account of many more that are coming ; but whether 
they will wait for Mr. Atkin's passport, or come on with 
their own, I know not. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Governor Dinwiddie, in which he desires me to present his compliments 
to you. I am, &,c. 
</p>
