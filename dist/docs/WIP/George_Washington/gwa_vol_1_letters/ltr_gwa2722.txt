DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, of the 14th of July, I have in appearance been very near my last breath. My indisposition 
increased upon me, and I fell into a very low and dangerous state. I once thought the grim king would 
certainly master my utmost efforts, and that I must sink, 
in spite of a resolute struggle ; but, thank God, I have 
now got the better of the disorder, and shall soon be restored, I hope, to perfect health again. 
</p><p>
I do not know, that I can muster up one tittle of news 
to communicate. In short, the occurrences of this part 
of the world are at present scarce worth reciting ; for, 
as we live in a state of peaceful tranquility ourselves, so 
we are at very little trouble to inquire after the operations against the Cherokees, who are the only people 
that disturb the repose of this great continent, and who, 
I believe, would gladly accommodate differences upon 
almost any terms ; not, I conceive, from any apprehensions they are under, on account of our arms, but because they want the supplies, with which we and we 
only can furnish them. We catch the reports of peace 
with gaping mouths, and every person seems anxious 
for a confirmation of that desirable event, provided it 
comes, as no doubt it will, upon honorable terms. 
</p><p>
On the other side is an invoice of clothes, which I 
beg the favor of you to purchase for me, and to send 
them by the first ship bound to this river. As they are 
designed for wearing- apparel for myself, I have committed the choice of them to your fancy, having the best 
opinion of your taste. I want neither lace nor embroidery. Plain clothes, with gold or silver buttons, if worn 
in genteel dress, are all that I desire. I have hitherto 
had my clothes made by one Charles Lawrence. 
Whether it be the fault of the tailor, or of the measure 
sent, I cannot say, but, certain it is, my clothes have 
never fitted me well. I therefore leave the choice of 
the workman to you. I enclose a measure, and, for a 
further direction, I think it not amiss to add, that my 
stature is six feet ; otherwise rather slender than corpulent. I am very sincerely, dear Sir, your most affectionate humble servant.
