<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 9 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a> I promised a particular detail of 
my observations upon the situation of our frontiers, 
when I arrived at this place. Although I was pretty 
explicit in that letter, I cannot avoid recapitulating part 
of the subject now. 
</p><p>
From Fort Trial on Smith's River, I returned to Fort 
William on the Catawba, where I met Colonel Buchanan 
with about thirty men, chiefly officers, to conduct me up 
Jackson's River, along the range of forts. With this 
small company of irregulars, with whom order, regularity, circumspection, and vigilance were matters of 
derision and contempt, we set out, and, by the protection of Providence, reached Augusta Court-House in 
seven days, without meeting the enemy ; otherwise we 
must have fallen a sacrifice, through the indiscretion of 
these whooping, hallooing gentlemen soldiers ! 
</p><p>
This jaunt afforded me an opportunity of seeing the 
bad regulation of the militia, the disorderly proceedings 
of the garrisons, and the unhappy circumstances of the 
inhabitants. 
</p><p>
First, of the militia. The difficulty of collecting them 
on any emergency, I have often spoken of; and I appeal 
to sad experience, how great a disadvantage it is, that 
the enemy should have every opportunity to plunder, 
kill, and escape, before the militia can afford any assistance. And not to mention the expensiveness of their 
service in general, I can instance several cases, where a 
captain, lieutenant, and, I may add, an ensign, with two 
or three sergeants, and six or eight men, will go upon 
duty at a time. The proportion of expense in this case 
is so unjust and obvious, that your Honor wants it not 
to be proved. 
</p><p>
Then these men, when raised, are to be continued 
only one month on duty, half of which time is lost in 
their marching out and home, especially those from the 
adjacent counties, who must be on duty some time before they reach their stations, by which means double 
sets of men are in pay at the same time, and for the 
same service. Again, the waste of provision they make 
is unaccountable ; no method or order in being served 
or purchasing at the best rates, but quite the reverse. 
Allowance for each man, as in the case of other soldiers, 
they look upon as the highest indignity, and would 
sooner starve, than carry a few days' provision on their 
backs for conveniency. But upon their march, when 
breakfast is wanted, they knock down the first beef 
they meet with, and, after regaling themselves, march 
on till dinner, when they take the same method, and so 
for supper, to the great oppression of the people. Or, 
if they chance to impress cattle for provision, the valuation is left to ignorant and interested neighbours, who 
have suffered by those practices, and, despairing of their 
pay, exact high prices, and thus the public is imposed 
upon at all events. I might add, I believe, that, for the 
want of proper laws to govern the militia (I cannot ascribe it to any other cause), they are obstinate, selfwilled, perverse, of little or no service to the people, 
and very burthensome to the country. Every individual 
has his own crude notions of things, and must undertake 
to direct. If his advice is neglected, he thinks himself 
slighted, abused, and injured ; and, to redress his wrongs, will depart for his home. These, Sir, are literally matters of fact, partly from persons of undoubted 
veracity, but chiefly from my own observations. 
</p><p>
Secondly, concerning the garrisons. I found them 
very weak for want of men ; but more so from indolence 
and irregularity. I saw none in a posture of defence, 
and few that might not be surprised with the greatest 
ease. An instance of this appeared at Dickinson's Fort, 
where the Indians ran down, caught several children 
playing under the walls, and had got to the gate before 
they were discovered. Was not Vass's Fort surprised, 
and a good many souls lost, in the same manner ? They 
keep no guard, but just when the enemy is about, and 
they are under fearful apprehensions ; nor ever stir out 
of the forts, from the time they reach them, till relieved 
on their month being expired ; at which time they 
march off, be the event what it will. Of the ammunition 
they are as careless as of the provisions, firing it away 
frequently at targets for wagers. On our journey, as 
we approached one of their forts, we heard a quick fire 
for several minutes, and concluded for certain that they 
were attacked ; so we marched in the best manner to 
their relief ; but when we came up, we found they were 
diverting themselves at marks. These men afford no 
assistance to the unhappy settlers, who are driven from 
their plantations, either in securing their harvests, or 
gathering their corn. Lieutenant Bullitt, commanding 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, sent to Major Lewis of Albemarle, 
who commanded a party of sixty militia at Miller's, 
about fifteen miles above him, where were also thirty 
men of Augusta, for some men to join his small parties 
to gather the corn. Major Lewis refused assistance, 
and would not divide his men. I wrote to him, but got 
no answer. Mr. Bullitt has done what he could with 
his few men, not quite thirty. Of the many forts, which I passed by, I saw but one or two that had their captains present, they being absent chiefly on their own 
business, and had given leave to several of the men to 
do the same. Yet these persons, I will venture to say, 
will charge the country their full month's pay. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the wretched and unhappy situation of the 
inhabitants needs few words, after a slight reflection on 
the preceding circumstances. They are fully sensible 
of their misery ; they feel their insecurity in relying on 
militia, who are slow in coming to their assistance, indifferent about their preservation, unwilling to continue, 
and regardless of every thing but their own ease. In 
short, they are so affected with approaching ruin, that 
the whole back country is in a general motion towards 
the southern colonies ; and I expect that scarce a family 
will inhabit Frederic, Hampshire, or Augusta, in a little 
time. They petitioned me in the most earnest manner 
for companies of the regiment. But alas ! it is not in 
my power to assist them with any, unless I leave this 
dangerous quarter more exposed than they are. I 
promised, at their particular request, to address your 
Honor and the Assembly in their behalf, that a regular 
force may be established in lieu of the militia and ranging companies, which are of much less service, and of 
infinitely more cost to the country. Were this done, 
the whole w r ould be under one direction, and any misbehaviour could never pass with impunity. Whereas 
the others are soldiers at will. And, indeed, the manner in which some of the ranging captains have obtained 
their commissions, if I am rightly informed, is by imposture and artifice. They produce a list, I am told, to 
your Honor, of sundry persons, who are willing to serve 
under them. One part, it is said, consists of fictitious 
names ; another, the names of persons who never saw 
the list ; and the remainder are persons drawn into it by fallacious promises, that cannot be performed without detriment to the service. But were it otherwise, 
surely any person, who considers the pay of the soldiers 
and that of the militia, will find a considerable difference, though both under the best regulations. 
</p><p>
As defensive measures are evidently insufficient for 
the security and safety of the country, I hope no arguments are requisite to prove the necessity of altering 
them to a vigorous offensive war, in order to remove 
the evil. But, should the Assembly still indulge that 
favorite scheme of protecting the inhabitants by forts 
along the frontiers, in which too many of them put their 
dependence, and as the building of these forts has been 
encouraged and confirmed by an act of Assembly, I 
take the liberty to present your Honor with a plan of 
the number of forts, and strength necessary to each, 
reaching entirely across our frontiers from north to 
south. This plan is calculated upon the most moderate 
and easy terms for sparing expense to the country, and, 
I believe, with tolerable propriety to answer the wishedfor design of protecting the settlers. Besides, most of 
the forts are already built by the country-people or soldiers, and require but little improvement, save one or 
two, as Dickinson's and Cox's. Your Honor will see 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> excluded in this list.
</p><p>
The advantage of having the militia in Augusta under one command, I have already hinted at ; and I 
think Major Lewis should have your Honor's orders to take that duty in hand, with directions to secure 
those important passes of Dickinson's and Vass's, by 
building a fort in the neighbourhood of Dickinson's, or 
by some other means. Were it practicable to get the 
people to assemble in little towns contiguous to these 
forts, it would contribute much to their mutual peace 
and safety, during the continuance of the Indian war. 
The Augusta people complain greatly for want of 
money. 
</p><p>
The other day eleven Indians of the Catawba tribe 
came here, and we undoubtedly might have had more 
of them, had the proper means been used to send trusty 
guides to invite and conduct them to us ; but this is neglected. One Matthew Tool makes his boast of stopping 
them until he shall be handsomely rewarded for bringing them ; and Major Lewis can inform you of one 
Bemer, who uses every method to hinder the Cherokees from coming to our assistance. Complaint should 
be made to Governor Littleton of these persons. Indian goods are much wanted to reward the Catawbas, 
and encourage them to engage in our service. 
</p><p>
Your Honor and the Assembly should determine 
several essential points ; namely, a proper method of 
paying rewards for taking up deserters, the present 
one being very discouraging, as it delays payment until 
Courts of Claims have decided ; means to replace the 
drafts, that must be discharged in December; ascertaining the pay of workmen employed on all public 
works, or empowering the commanding officer to agree 
on the cheapest terms he can with them ; how the masters of servants enlisted for the Virginia regiment are to 
be paid. We have already recruited more than fifty, 
and are daily dunned for payment by the masters. A 
report prevails, to my great surprise, though disbelief, 
that your Honor had told some persons, who applied to you for satisfaction for their servants, that I had 
no orders to enlist any. This false rumor occasions 
strange reflections, and must make me appear in a very 
unjust light to the world. I have, therefore, desisted 
from recruiting until you direct me in what manner 
those already obtained are to be paid for ; and I beg 
you will give me immediate advice on the affair, as the 
people are impatient, and threaten us with prosecutions 
from all quarters. 
</p><p>
Your Honor has herewith a copy of the council of 
war, held in behalf of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, in which the 
arguments are justly and fully laid down, both with regard to Virginia in particular, and to the three colonies 
in general. On the back of the copy are my sentiments candidly offered, and to your Honor I leave the 
determination of this important affair, f 
</p><p>
As to a chaplain, if the government will grant a subsistence, we can readily get a person of merit to accept 
the place, without giving the commissary any trouble on that point.
</p><p>
Your Honor has had advice of two spies, that were 
taken at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> ; one of whom they quickly 
hung up as his just reward, being a deserter ; the other 
was sent to Governor Sharpe, to give information of the 
infernal practices followed by some of the priests of that 
province, in holding correspondence with our enemy.
