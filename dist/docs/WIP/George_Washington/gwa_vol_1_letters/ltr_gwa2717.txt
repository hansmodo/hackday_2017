SIR, 
</p><p>
In a letter which I wrote you the 1st of last month, 
was enclosed an invoice of sundries, which I then was 
and still am much in need of. If those goods should 
not be shipped before this letter gets to hand, pray add 
to your purchase the things, which you will find on the 
other side, and send them as there directed. 
</p><p>
I shall find occasion to write you fully by the fleet, 
and shall enclose a list of sundries, that will be wanted 
for the estate's use. Till then I shall forbear to trouble you with particulars, as I shall expect also by that 
time to receive some account of the sales of the estate's tobacco sent you, and an account current. As 
this last is necessary for me to compare with my own 
account, in order to a satisfactory settlement with our 
General Court, I entreat you to be punctual in sending 
me one every spring and fall yearly. 
</p><p>
I shall keep the estate under the same direction as formerly, neither altering the managers, the kind of tobacco, 
nor the manner of treating it, unless you advise otherwise for our interest. And, while I continue to pursue this 
method, I hope you will be able to render such sales, as 
will not only justify the present consignments to you, 
but encourage my enlarging them ; for I shall be candid 
in telling you, that duty to the charge with which I am 
entrusted, as well as self-interest, will incline me to 
abide by those, who give the greatest proof of their abilities in selling my own and the estate's tobacco, and purchasing our goods, of which I can no otherwise judge, 
than by the accounts that will be rendered. And here 
permit me to ask, if it would be advisable to change the 
marks of any of the tobacco, or had I best ship it all 
under the usual marks ? If so, my part may be known 
by some small distinction, such as you can best advise. 
</p><p>
In my last, among other things, I desired you would 
send me, besides a small octavo volume, the best system 
now extant of agriculture. Since then, I have been told, 
that there is one, lately published, done by various hands, 
but chiefly collected from the papers of Mr. Hale. If 
this is known to be the best, pray send it, but not if any 
other is in higher esteem. I am, &c. 
</p>
