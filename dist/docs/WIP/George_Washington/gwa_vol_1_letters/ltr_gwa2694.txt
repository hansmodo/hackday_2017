</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I came here at this critical juncture, by the express 
order of Sir John St. Clair, to represent in the fullest 
manner the posture of our affairs at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and to 
obviate any doubts, that might arise from the best written narrative. I shall make use of the following method, 
as the most effectual I can at present suggest, to lay 
sundry matters before you, for your information, approbation, and direction. And I hope, that, when your 
Honor considers how we are situated, and the importance of despatch, you will please to give me explicit 
and speedy answers, on the several points here submitted. 
</p><p>
First, Sir John St. Glair's letter jvill, I apprehend, 
inform you of our principal wants, namely, arms, tents, 
and other sorts of field- equipage, articles so absolutely 
and obviously necessary, as to need no argument to 
prove, that the men will be useless without them, and 
that the vast sums of money, expended in levying and 
marching them to the place of rendezvous, will be entirely lost, besides impeding if not defeating the expedition. 
</p><p>
Secondly, the officers will be unprovided with the 
means of taking the field, till they have an allowance 
made them of baggage, forage, and bat-money. Governor Dinwiddie, from what cause I could never yet learn, thought proper to discontinue this allowance to the 
companies that remained in Virginia, at the same time 
that he allowed it to those who went to Carolina, although I produced evidence under General Stanwix's 
hand, that all officers were entitled to it, and that it was 
essential to enable them to take the field. General 
Forbes has obtained this allowance for the Pennsylvania 
troops, and desired Sir John St. Clair to urge it strongly 
on this government also. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the unequal pay of the two Virginia regiments will, I conceive, if a stop is not put to it, be productive of great discontent, and many evils. For the 
soldiers of the first regiment think their claim upon the 
country equally as good, if not better than that of the 
second, because their services are not limited.  They 
have lacked the great bounty, which the others have received, and have had no clothes for almost two years, 
although they have an annual call for clothes, and in 
strictness the same right to expect them. 
</p><p>
Fourthly, as our regimental clothing cannot possibly 
last through the campaign, will it not be advisable to 
obtain a supply for next winter? I have sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> for one thousand pair of Indian stockings, or 
leggins, the better to equip my men for the woods ; and 
I now inquire whether I am to pay for them in behalf of 
the country, or deduct the cost out of their pay. As 
they have not received the clothing, to which they are 
entitled, they may think this latter a hardship. 
</p><p>
Fifthly, should not the pay of the surgeon's mates in 
the first regiment be equal to that of those in the 
second 1 The latter have four shillings and the former only three per day. Should there not, likewise, be the 
same number of surgeon's mates allowed to the old as 
to the new regiment ? 
</p><p>
Sixthly, it will cause great dissatisfaction in the regiment, if Lieutenant Baker is put over the heads of older 
officers. It is granted, that Mr. Baker is a very deserving officer, but there are others equally deserving, and 
who have adventured equally to seek glory, and to merit 
applause. 
</p><p>
Seventhly, Sir John St. Clair directs, in consequence 
of orders from the General, that the first Virginia regiment shall immediately be completed, and leaves the 
mode of doing it to your Honor. I should be glad of 
direction in this affair. The season, I fear, is too far 
advanced to attempt it now by recruiting. 
</p><p>
Eighthly, are the works at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a> still to go 
on ? If so, in what manner are they to be forwarded, 
and under whose direction ? Nothing surely will contribute more to the public weal, than this fort when 
completed ; because it will be a valuable repository for 
our stores, if the event of our enterprise prove successful, and an asylum for the inhabitants, and a place 
of retreat for our troops, in case of a defeat. 
</p><p>
Ninthly, great advantages must arise, by appointing 
Lieutenant Smith to that direction, and to the command 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. First, because he has had the charge 
of the works for nearly two years, and has, by that 
means, become perfectly well acquainted with every 
thing intended to be done. Secondly, because there 
must necessarily be many sick and lame soldiers left at 
that garrison, who may require the eye of a diligent officer to keep them together. Thirdly, because all the 
regimental stores and baggage must remain at that place, 
and ought to be under the care of an officer, who can 
be made accountable for his conduct ; and not left to the mercy of an ungovernable and refractory militia. 
Fourthly, this is important, if for no other reason than 
to preserve the materials lying there for finishing the 
works. 
</p><p>
Tenthly, I conceive we shall be ordered to take with us the greatest part of the ammunition now at Fort 
Loudoun. It will be necessary, therefore, to have a supply laid in at that place for the use of the frontier garrisons. 
</p><p>
Eleventhly, in a late letter I endeavoured to point out, in what manner the service would be benefited, by continuing Rutherford's rangers in the parts they at 
present occupy, and sending the militia of Prince William to the Branch. I again recommend it, for the reasons then given, and for many others, which might be given. 
</p><p>
I must now conclude, with once more begging, that your Honor will hasten some speedy determination on these several matters. From what Sir John St. Clair 
has written, from my orders, and from the statement here made, I conceive it must sufficiently appear, that the greatest despatch is necessary. The success of our 
expedition will, in a manner, depend on its early commencement. Every delay, therefore, may be attended with pernicious consequences. 
</p><p>
The Indians, glad of any pretence for returning home, will make use of delays for a handle ; and a spirit of discontent and desertion may spring up among the new levies for want of employment. 
</p><p>
These are matters obvious to me, and my duty requires, that I represent them in this free and candid manner. I am your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant. 
</p>
