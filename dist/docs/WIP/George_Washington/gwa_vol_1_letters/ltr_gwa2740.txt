</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have heard, (the truth of which, if you saw Lord 
Dunmore in his way to or from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a> you possibly 
are better acquainted with than I am,) that his Lordship 
will grant patents for lands lying below the Scioto, to 
the officers and soldiers, who claim under the proclamation of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. If so, I think no time should be 
lost in having them surveyed, lest some new revolution 
should happen in our political system. I have, therefore, by this conveyance, written to Captain Bullitt, 
to desire he will have ten thousand acres surveyed for 
me ; five thousand of which I am entitled to in my own right, the other five thousand by purchase from a captain and lieutenant. 
</p><p>
I have desired him to get this quantity of land in one 
tract, if to be had of the first quality ; if not, then in two, 
or even in three, agreeably to the several rights under 
which I hold, rather than survey bad land for me, or 
even that which is middling. I have also desired him 
to get it as near the mouth of the Scioto, that is, to the 
western bounds of the new colony  as may be ; but for 
the sake of' better lands, I would go quite down to the 
Falls, or even below, meaning thereby to get richer 
and wider bottoms, as it is my desire to have my lands 
run out upon the banks of the Ohio. If you should go 
down the river this fall, in order to look out your own 
quantity under the proclamation, I shall be much obliged 
to you for your assistance to Captain Bullitt, in getting 
these ten thousand acres for me, of the most valuable 
land you can, and I will endeavour to make you ample 
amends for your trouble ; but I by no means wish or 
desire you to go down on my account, unless you find 
it expedient on your own. Of this I have written to 
Captain Bullitt, under cover to you, desiring, if you 
should be with him, that he will ask your assistance. 
</p><p>
As I have understood that Captain Thompson (by 
what authority I know not) has been surveying a good 
deal of land for the Pennsylvania officers, and that Dr. 
Connolly has a promise from our Governor of two thousand acres at the Falls, I have desired Captain Bullitt 
by no means to involve me in disputes with any person, 
who has an equal claim to land with myself, under the 
proclamation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. As to the pretensions of other 
people, it is not very essential ; as I am told that the 
Governor has declared he will grant patents to none but 
the officers and soldiers, who are comprehended within the proclamation aforementioned ; but even of these 
claims, if I could get lands equally as good, as convenient, and as valuable in every respect, elsewhere, I 
should choose to steer clear. 
</p><p>
Old David Wilper, who was an officer in our regiment, and has been with Bullitt running out land for 
himself and others, tells me, that they have already discovered four salt springs in that country, three oi 
which Captain Thompson has included within some surveys he has made ; and the other, an exceedingly valuable one, upon the River Kentucky, is in some kind of dispute. I wish I could establish one of my surveys there ; 
I would immediately turn it to an extensive public benefit, as well as private advantage. However, as four are 
already discovered, it is more than probable there are 
many others, and if you could come at the knowledge 
of them by means of the Indians, or otherwise, I would 
join you in taking them up in the name or names of 
some persons, who have a right under the proclamation, 
and whose right we can be sure of buying, as it seems 
there is no other method of having lands granted ; 
but this should be done with a good deal of circumspection and caution, till patents are obtained. 
</p><p>
I did not choose to forego the opportunity of writing 
to you by the gentlemen, who are going to divide their 
land at the mouth of the great Kenhawa, though I could 
wish to have delayed it till I could hear from the Governor, to whom I have written, to know certainly whether he will grant patents for the land which Captain Bullitt is surveying, that one may proceed with safety ; as also whether a discretionary power, which I had given 
Mr. Wood to select my land in West Florida, under an 
information, even from his Lordship himself, that lands 
could not be had here, would be any bar to my surveying on the Ohio ; especially as I have heard since Mr. Wood's departure, that all the lands on that part of 
the Mississippi, to which he was restricted by me, are 
already engaged by the emigrants, who have resorted 
to that country. Should I, however, receive any discouraging account from his Lordship on these heads, I 
shall embrace the first opportunity that offers afterwards 
to acquaint you with it. 
</p><p>
By Mr. Leet I informed you of the unhappy cause, 
which prevented my going out this fall. But I hope 
nothing will prevent my seeing you in that country in 
the spring. The precise time, as yet, it is not in my 
power to fix ; but I should be glad if you would let me 
know how soon it may be attended with safety, ease, 
and comfort, after which I will fix upon a time to be at 
your house. 
</p><p>
I am in the mean while, with sincere good wishes for 
you, Mrs. Crawford, and family, your friend, &c.
