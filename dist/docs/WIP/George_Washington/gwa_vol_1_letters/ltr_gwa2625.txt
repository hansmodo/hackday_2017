DEAR ORME, 
</p><p>
I came to this camp on Thursday last, with the rear 
of Colonel Dunbar's detachment, and should have continued on with his front to-day, but was prevented by rain. 
</p><p>
My fevers are very moderate, and, I hope, near terminating. Then I shall have nothing to encounter but 
weakness, which is excessive, and the difficulty of getting to you, arising therefrom ; but this I would not miss 
doing, before you reach Duquesne, for five hundred pounds. However, I have no doubt now of doing it, as 
I am moving on, and the General has given me his word of honor, in the most solemn manner, that it shall be effected. 
</p><p>
As the Doctor thinks it imprudent for me to use much 
exercise for two or three days, my movements will be 
retarded. I should be glad, therefore, to be advised of 
your marches from Gist's, and how you are likely to 
proceed, for you may rest assured, that Colonel Dunbar 
cannot remove from this present encampment in less 
than two or three days ; and I believe, really, it will be 
as much as he possibly can do to reach the Meadows at 
all, so that you will be greatly in advance of him. 
</p><p>
I am too weak to add more, than my compliments to 
the General and the family, and again to desire, that you 
will oblige me in the above request, and devise the most 
effectual means for me to join you. I am, dear Orme, 
your most obedient servant.
</p>
