TO THE REVEREND DR. COOPER, PRESIDENT OF KING'S COLLEGE, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 31 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
REVEREND SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have a set of bills for one hundred 
pounds sterling, which please to set at the prevailingexchange, and retain the money in your own hands to 
answer Mr. Custis's expenses at college, and such calls 
as he may have for cash to defray the incident expenses 
of his abode in this city. 
</p><p>
In respect to the first article of charge, I submit the 
matter wholly to your better judgment, under a firm 
belief of your adopting such measures, as will most contribute to promote the principal end of Mr. Custis's 
coming here, not regarding the extra charge incurred in 
the accomplishment of it. In regard to the second, 
as I do not know what sum he ought, with propriety, to 
expend in such a place as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I shall not undertake to determine it ; but hope, if, contrary to my expectation, you should find him inclined to run into any 
kind of extravagance, you will be so good, by your 
friendly admonition, as to check its progress. 
</p><p>
As Mr. Custis may probably want clothing and other 
necessaries, you will please to establish a credit in his 
behalf with such merchants as you can recommend ; and 
when the deposit now lodged with you is expended in 
this and other payments, be so good as to transmit me 
a copy of the disbursements, and I shall furnish you 
with other bills whereby to lay in a new fund. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to add at present, except that 
at the next vacation, or at any other time, I shall think 
myself very happy in seeing you in Virginia, and that I 
am, with very great respect and esteem, your most obedient humble servant. 
</p>
