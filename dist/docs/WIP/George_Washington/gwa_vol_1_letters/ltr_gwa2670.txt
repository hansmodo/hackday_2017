</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
A scouting party, consisting of five soldiers and fifteen Cherokee Indians, who were sent out the 20th 
ultimo towards the Ohio, under Lieutenant Baker, returned the 8th instant to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with five 
scalps, and a French officer, prisoner, having killed two 
other officers of the same party. Mr. Baker met with 
this party (ten French, three officers) on the head of 
Turtle Creek, twenty miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, the 
day after they had parted with fifty Shawanese Indians 
returning from war, and would have killed and made 
prisoners of them all, had not the death of the Indian chief, who was killed in that skirmish, prevented their 
pursuing them. The name of the officer taken, according to his own account, is Velistre ; and of those killed, 
Lasosais and St. Oure ; all ensigns. 
</p><p>
The commandant at Duquesne and its dependencies 
is Delignery, a knight of the military order of St. Louis, 
and captain of a company of detached troops from the 
marine. This officer likewise says, that the garrison at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> consists of six hundred French and two 
hundred Indians. We sustained on our side the loss 
of the brave Swallow warrior, and one other Indian 
wounded, whom the party brought in on a bier, with no 
other sustenance for the last four days, than such as 
they derived from wild onions. 
</p><p>
Captain Spots wood, with ten soldiers and twenty Indians, who went out at the same time, but to a different 
place, is not yet come in, nor any news of him ; which 
makes me uneasy. , 
</p><p>
Our Assembly have granted a further sum of eighty 
thousand pounds for the service of the ensuing year, 
and have agreed, I believe, to complete the regiment 
of this colony to twelve hundred men, besides three 
companies of rangers, of one hundred men each. Our 
strength, since the detachment embarked for Carolina, 
amounts only to four hundred and twenty rank and file ; 
and these much weakened, by the number of posts 
we hold. Governor Dinwiddie is apprehensive, that he 
shall not be able to provide arms for all these men, and 
he desired me to advise with you thereupon. 
</p><p>
Duty and inclination equally induce me to communicate all remarkable occurrences to you, and I shall be 
punctual in doing so. At present, however, I have only 
to add, that I am, with very great respect, your most 
obedient humble servant. 
</p>
