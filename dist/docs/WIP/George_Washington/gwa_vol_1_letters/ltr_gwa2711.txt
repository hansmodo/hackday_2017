Armstrong's Camp, 18 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I came to this camp about eleven o'clock to-day, having 
opened the road before me. I should immediately have 
proceeded on, but, as the bullocks were to be slaughtered, 
and provisions dressed, I thought it expedient to halt 
here till three in the morning, when I shall begin to 
march with one thousand men, leaving Colonel Armstrong and five hundred more in this camp, until Colonel 
Montgomery joins him. I took care that the road 
should not be delayed by this halt, for I ordered out a 
working party, properly covered, before I came here, to 
cut it forward till night, and then return. 
</p><p>
I fear that we have been greatly deceived, with regard to the distance from this place to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
Most of the woods-men, that I have conversed with, 
seem to think that we are still thirty miles from it. I 
have sent out a party in that direction to ascertain the 
distance, and the kind of ground to be passed over, and 
two others to scout on the right and left, for the discovery of tracks. 
</p><p>
I found three redoubts erecting for the defence of this 
camp. Mr. Gordon thinks, that it will be sufficiently 
secured by these means ; but, for my own part, I do not 
look upon redoubts alone, in this close country, to be 
half as good as the slightest breastwork ; indeed, I do 
not believe they are any security at all without other 
works. 
</p><p>
I enclose you a return of the total strength of this 
place, and the time for which we are served with provisions, by which you will see how much a supply is 
needed. I must beg, that commissaries and steelyards 
may be sent forward, otherwise a continual dissatisfaction will prevail, as well on the part of the contractors, 
as on that of the soldiers, who think they have injustice 
done them in their allowance, notwithstanding that the 
fifteen bullocks, which were received as provisions for 
four days, were issued for three only, by the judgment 
of an officer from each corps, as well as my own, for I 
took pains to examine into it myself. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far, when your favor of this morning came to hand. I shall set out at three o'clock, as 
above, leaving the Highlanders to finish the redoubts, 
according to Mr. Gordon's plan, and to secure the tools, 
until Colonel Montgomery comes up, submitting it then 
to Colonel Bouquet's opinion to bring or leave them. 
</p><p>
Your chimney at this place is finished. I shall take 
care to put up one at the next post.  
</p><p>
I shall use every necessary precaution to get timely 
notice of the enemy's approach, so that I flatter myself 
you need be under no apprehensions on that head. A 
scouting party is just returned, and reports, that, five 
miles advanced, thay discovered the tracks of about 
forty persons making towards Kiskemanetas. The 
tracks appear to have been made to-day, or yesterday. 
</p><p>
I am, with very great respect, your most obedient, 
</p>
