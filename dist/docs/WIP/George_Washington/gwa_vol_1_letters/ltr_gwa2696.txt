SIR, 
</p><p>
According to orders I marched from Winchester on 
the 24th ultimo, and arrived at this place yesterday, 
with five companies of the first Virginia regiment, and a 
company of artificers from the second, as you may observe by the enclosed returns. My march, in consequence of bad teams and bad roads, notwithstanding I 
had sent forward the artificers and a covering party 
three days before, was much delayed. As I cannot suppose you intended to send any part of my men upon 
the roads, till joined at this place by Colonel Byrd, I shall decline sending any on that service till he arrives, which I presume will be to-morrow. 
</p><p>
There came twenty-eight wagons with me to this place, and I believe, if they were wanted, ten more 
might be had upon the South Branch, strong and good ; but carrying-horses are certainly more eligible for the 
service to which we are destined. I have received a very scanty allowance of tents for the five companies, 
namely, sixty-nine only. Out of these most of the officers must either be supplied, or lie uncovered. They 
will readily pay for what they receive, if required. No bell-tents were sent to us. 
</p><p>
My men are very bare of regimental clothing, and I 
have no prospect of a supply. So far from regretting 
this want during the present campaign, if I were left to 
pursue my own inclinations, I would not only order the 
men to adopt the Indian dress, but cause the officers to 
do it also, and be the first to set the example myself. 
Nothing but the uncertainty of obtaining the general approbation causes me to hesitate a moment to leave my 
regimentals at this place, and proceed as light as any 
Indian in the woods. It is an unbecoming dress, I own, 
for an officer; but convenience, rather than show, I think, 
should be consulted. The reduction of bat-horses alone 
would be sufficient to recommend it ; for nothing is more 
certain than that less baggage would be required, and 
the public benefited in proportion. I am, &,c.
