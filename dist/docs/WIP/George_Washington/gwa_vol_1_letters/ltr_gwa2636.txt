<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 11 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
As I think it my indispensable duty to inform you 
particularly of my proceedings, and to give the most 
plain and authentic accounts, from time to time, of our 
situation, I must acquaint you that, immediately after 
giving" the necessary orders at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, and 
despatching expresses to hurry the recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, I rode post to this place. I passed by Lord 
Fairfax's, who was not at home, but was here, where I 
arrived yesterday about noon, and found every thing in 
the greatest hurry and confusion, by the back inhabitants 
flocking in, and those of this town moving out, which I 
have, as far as was in my power, prevented. I was desirous of proceeding immediately, at the head of some 
militia, to put a stop to the ravages of the enemy, believing their numbers to be few; but I was told by 
Colonel Martin, who had attempted to raise the militia 
for the same purpose, that it was impossible to get above 
twenty or twenty-five men, they having absolutely refused to stir, choosing, as they say, to die with their 
wives and families. 
</p><p>
Finding this expedient likely to prove abortive, I 
sent off expresses to hurry on the recruits from below, 
and the militia from Fairfax and Prince William, who 
had been ordered out by Lord Fairfax. I also hired 
spies to go out and discover the numbers of the enemy, 
and to encourage the rangers, who, we were told, were 
blocked up by the Indians in small fortresses. But, if I 
may offer my opinion, I believe they are more encompassed with fear, than by the enemy. I have also 
impressed wagons and sent them to Conococheague for 
flour, musket-balls, and flints. Powder, and a trifling quantity of paper, bought at extravagant prices, for cartridges, I expect from below. 
</p><p>
Six or eight smiths are now at work, repairing the 
firearms that are here, which are all that we have to depend upon. A man was hired, on the 24th of last 
month, to do the whole, but neglected it, and was just 
moving off to Pennsylvania in wagons. I impressed his 
wagons, and compelled him by force to assist in this 
work. In all things I meet with the greatest opposition. 
</p><p>
No orders are obeyed, but such as a party of soldiers, 
or my own drawn sword, enforces. Without this, not 
a single horse, for the most earnest occasion, can be 
had, to such a pitch has the insolence of these people 
arrived, by having every point hitherto submitted to 
them. However, I have given up none, where his Majesty's service requires the contrary, and where my proceedings are justified by my instructions; nor will I, 
unless they execute what they threaten, that is, " blow 
out our brains." 
</p><p>
I have invited the poor distressed people, who were 
driven from their habitations, to lodge their families in 
some place of security, and to join our parties in scouring the woods, where the enemy lie ; and I believe 
some will cheerfully assist. I have also taken, and shall 
continue to take, every previous step to forward the 
march of the recruits, as soon as they arrive here. Your 
Honor may depend, that nothing in my power shall be 
wanting for the good of the service. I would again hint 
the necessity of putting the militia under a better regulation, had I not mentioned it twice before, and a third 
time may seem impertinent. But I must once more 
beg leave to declare, for here I am more immediately 
concerned, that, unless the Assembly will pass an act to 
enforce the military law in all its parts, I must, with 
great regret, decline the honor that has been so generously intended me. I am urged to this, by the foreknowledge I have of failing in every point, that might 
justly be expected from a person invested with full 
power to execute his authority. I see the growing 
insolence of the soldiers, and the indolence and inactivity 
of the officers, who are all sensible how limited their 
punishments are, compared with what they ought to be. 
In fine, I can plainly see, that under the present establishment, we shall become a nuisance, an insupportable 
charge to our country, and never answer any one expectation of the Assembly. And here I must assume 
the freedom to express some surprise, that we alone 
should be so tenacious of our liberty, as not to invest a 
power, where interest and policy so unanswerably demand it, and whence so much good must consequently 
ensue. Do we not know, that every nation under the 
sun finds its account therein, and that, without it, no order 
or regularity can be observed 1 Why then should it be 
expected from us, who are all young and inexperienced, 
to govern and keep up a proper spirit of discipline without laws, when the best and most experienced can 
scarcely do it with them ? If we consult our interest, I 
am sure it loudly calls for them. I can confidently 
assert, that recruiting, clothing, arming, maintaining, and 
subsisting soldiers, who have since deserted, have cost 
the country an immense sum, which might have been 
prevented, were we under restraints, that would terrify 
the soldiers from such practices. 
</p><p>
One thing more on this head I will recommend, and 
then quit the subject ; that is, to have the inhabitants 
liable to certain heavy fines, or corporal punishments, 
for entertaining deserters, and a reward offered for taking them up. If this were done, it would be next to an 
impossibility for a soldier to escape ; but, as things now 
stand, they are not only seduced to run away, but are also harboured and assisted with every necessary means 
to do it. 
</p><p>
Sunday noon. Last night arrived an express, just 
spent with fatigue and fear, reporting that a party of 
Indians were seen about twelve miles off, at the plantation of one Isaac Julian, and that the inhabitants were 
flying in the most promiscuous manner from their dwellings. I immediately ordered the town guards to be 
strengthened, Perkins's lieutenant to be in readiness 
with his companies, some recruits, who had only arrived 
about half an hour before, to be armed, and sent two 
men, well acquainted with the roads, to go up that road, 
and lie in wait, to see if they could discover the number and motion of the Indians, that we might have 
timely notice of their approach. This morning, before 
we could parade the men, arrived a second express, ten 
times more terrified than the former, with information, 
that the Indians had got within four miles of the town, 
and were killing and destroying all before them, and that 
he himself had heard constant firing, and shrieks of the 
unhappy murdered ! Upon this, I immediately collected 
what force I could, which consisted of twenty -two men, 
recruited for the rangers, and nineteen of the militia, 
and marched directly to the place, where these horrid 
murders were said to be committed. When we came 
there, whom should we find occasioning all this disturbance, but three drunken soldiers of the light-horse, 
carousing, firing their pistols, and uttering the most 
unheard-of imprecations ? These we took, and marched 
them as prisoners to town, where we met the men I 
sent out last night, and learned that the party of Indians, 
discovered by Isaac Julian, proved to be a mulatto and 
negro, seen hunting cattle by his child, who alarmed the 
father, and the father the neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
These circumstances are related only to show what a panic prevails among the people ; how much they are 
alarmed at the most usual and customary cries; and yet how impossible it is to get them to act in any respect 
for their common safety. As an instance of this, Colonel Fairfax, who arrived in town while we were upon a 
scout, immediately sent to a noble captain, not far off, to repair with his company forthwith to Winchester. With 
coolness and moderation this great captain answered, that his wife, family, and corn were all at stake; so 
were those of his soldiers ; therefore it was impossible for him to come. Such is the example of the officers ; 
such the behaviour of the men ; and upon such circumstances depends the safety of our country ! 
</p><p>
Monday morning. The men I hired to bring intelligence from the Branch returned last night, with letters 
from Captain Ashby, and the other parties there ; by which I learn, that the Indians are gone off; scouts 
having been dispersed upon those waters for several days, without discovering tracks or other signs of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I am also informed, that it is believed their numbers 
amounted to about one hundred and fifty ; that seventy 
of our men are killed and missing, and several houses 
and plantations destroyed, but not so great havoc made 
as was represented at first. The rangers, and a small 
company of militia, ordered there by Lord Fairfax, I am 
given to understand, intend to march down on Monday 
next. They will be immediately followed by all the 
inhabitants of those parts, that had come together under 
their protection. I have, therefore, sent peremptory 
orders to the contrary ; but what obedience will be paid 
to them a little time will reveal. I have ordered those 
men, that were recruited for the rangers, to join their 
respective companies. A party of militia, commanded 
by Captain Harden, also marched with them. Captain 
Waggener is this instant arrived with thirty recruits, 
whom he marched from Bellhaven in less than three 
days, a great march indeed ! Major Lewis and his 
recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> I expect in to-morrow, 
when, with these and twenty-two of Captain Bell's now 
here, I shall proceed by quick marches to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, in order to strengthen that garrison. Besides 
these, I think it absolutely essential, that there should 
be two or three companies exclusively of rangers, to 
guard the Potomac waters, until such time as our regiment is completed. Indeed, the rangers and volunteer 
companies in Augusta, with some of their militia, should 
be properly disposed of on those frontiers, for fear of an 
attack from that quarter. But this is submitted to your 
Honor's judgment, and waits your orders for its execution, if thought expedient. 
</p><p>
Captain Waggener informs me, that it was with 
difficulty he passed the Ridge for crowds of people, 
who were flying as if every moment was death. He 
endeavoured, but in vain, to stop them ; they firmly 
believing that Winchester was in flames. I shall send 
expresses down the several roads in hopes of bringing 
back the inhabitants, who are really frightened out of 
their senses. I despatched an express immediately 
upon my arrival at this place, with a copy of the enclosed letter to Andrew Montour, who I heard was at a 
place called Long Island, with three hundred Indians, 
to see if he could engage him and them to join us. I 
also wrote to Gist, acquainting him with the favor you 
intended him, and desired he would repair home, in 
order to raise his companies of scouts. 
</p><p>
I shall defer writing to the Speaker and Committee 
upon any other head, than that of commissary, still hoping to be down by the time mentioned in my last, 
provided no new disturbances happen, having some 
points to settle, that I am uneasy and urgent about. I 
have been obliged to do duty very foreign to my own ; 
but that I shall never hesitate about, when the good of 
the service requires it. 
</p><p>
In a journey from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> to Fort Dinwiddie, which I made purposely to see the situation of our 
frontiers, how the rangers were posted, and how troops might be disposed of for the defence of the country, I 
purchased six hundred and fifty beeves, to be delivered at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> by the 1st of November, at ten 
shillings per hundred weight, except a few for which I was obliged to give eleven shillings. My own bonds 
are now out for the performance of these covenants. This is the commissary's business, who, I am sorry to 
say, has hitherto been of no use, but of disservice to me, in neglecting my orders, and leaving this place without 
flour, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> without any provisions for the recruits, although he had timely notice. I must beg, 
that, if Mr. Dick will not act, some other person may be appointed ; for, if things remain in this uncertain situation, the season will pass without having provision made 
for the winter, or the summer campaign. 
</p><p>
I have appointed Captain George Mercer (whose seniority entitled him to it) my aid-de-camp ; and 
Mr. Kirkpatrick, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, my secretary, a young man bred to business, of good character, well recommended, and a person of whose abilities I had not the least doubt. 
</p><p>
I hope your Honor will be kind enough to despatd 
Colonel Stephen, with orders to repair hither immediately, and excuse the prolixity of this letter. I was 
willing to give a circumstantial account of our situation, 
that you may be the better enabled to judge what orders 
are necessary. I am, &,c.
