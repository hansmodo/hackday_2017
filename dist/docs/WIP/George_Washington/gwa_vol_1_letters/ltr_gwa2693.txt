DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this day favored with yours of the 4th instant, 
and should have thought myself extremely culpable and deficient in my duty, had I delayed one moment in 
transmitting to the General any intelligence I could procure ; much more in a matter so material as that upon 
which he has been informed. I must, therefore, beg 
that you will, from me, assure the General, that the 
Catawbas have not this year brought in one prisoner or 
scalp to this place, nor indeed to any other that I have 
heard of. No prisoner has been taken by any of our 
friendly Indians this season, and no scalps, except the 
two taken near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> by Ucahula, of which, 
and all the intelligence of the enemy in that quarter, 
which that young warrior was able to give, I, by the last 
post, sent to the General a full and circumstantial account. Nor would I have failed to keep him duly informed of every interesting occurrence, even had it not 
been recommended to me. 
</p><p>
It gave me no small uneasiness to be informed of the 
resolution of some of the Cherokees, to wander towards 
the Indian settlements in Maryland and Pennsylvania, 
clearly foreseeing the bad consequences such a peregrination would produce. I therefore represented the matter to Captain Gist in the strongest manner, and must 
do him the justice to say, that nothing in his power was 
omitted to prevent it. But our efforts proved ineffectual, as those two provinces last year, very impoliticly I 
humbly conceive, made presents to these Indians, and encouraged their returning thither this spring. Such is 
the nature of Indians, that nothing will prevent their going where they have any reason to expect presents, and 
their cravings are insatiable. 
</p><p>
I and my officers have constantly paid, and always will pay, the strictest regard to every circumstance, that 
may contribute to keep the Indians in good humor. But, as Governor Dinwiddie ordered me not to meddle 
with Indian affairs on any pretence whatever, the sole management of them being left to Mr. Atkin and his 
deputy Mr. Gist, and those orders having never been countermanded, neither I, nor my officers, have adventured to do any thing relative to them, but in a secondary manner through Mr. Gist. 
</p><p>
The Raven warrior was on a scout, in which he was unsuccessful. On his return hither, he produced two 
white men's scalps, which he brought from his own nation, and wanted to pass them for the enemy's, taken in 
his unsuccessful scout. In this villany he was detected by the other warriors, who were highly offended at so 
base a deceit, and threatened to kill him. A consciousness of his guilt, and a dread of being called to a severe 
account by his own countrymen, were the reasons, which many of them assigned for his going away in so 
abrupt, but by no means unsatisfactory, manner to the English. As Captain Bosomworth was here transacting 
Indian affairs, under the immediate orders of the Commander-in-chief, when the Raven warrior returned and 
was detected, I only wrote in mine to General Forbes incidentally on the subject, referring him to Captain Bosomworth for particulars. 
</p><p>
Enclosed is my return for April, but you will please to observe, that Captain Woodward's is made out from 
his last, as his great distance from hence puts it out of his power to send it in due time. 
</p><p>
I beg you will inform the General, that I shall, with 
great alacrity, obey all the orders, with which he may 
honor me. In the mean time, I am, with unfeigned regard, dear Halket, yours, &,c. 
</p>
