DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Before this letter will come to hand, you must undoubtedly have received an account of the engagement 
in the Massachusetts Bay, between the ministerial 
troops (for we do not, nor can we yet prevail upon ourselves to call them the King's troops), and the provincials of that government. But as you may not have 
heard how that affair began, I enclose you the several 
affidavits, which were taken after the action. 
</p><p>
General Gage acknowledges, that the detachment 
under Lieutenant- Colon el Smith was sent out to destroy 
private property; or, in other words, to destroy a 
magazine, which self-preservation obliged the inhabitants to establish. And he also confesses, in effect at 
least, that his men made a very precipitate retreat from 
Concord, notwithstanding the reinforcement under Lord 
Percy ; the last of which may serve to convince Lord 
Sandwich, and others of the same sentiment, that the 
Americans will fight for their liberties and property, 
however pusillanimous in his Lordship's eye they may 
appear in other respects. 
</p><p>
From the best accounts I have been able to collect 
of that affair, indeed from every one, I believe the fact, 
stripped of all coloring, to be plainly this, that, if the 
retreat had not been as precipitate as it was, and God 
knows it could not well have been more so, the ministerial troops must have surrendered, or been totally cut 
off. For they had not arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a> (under cover of their ships) half an hour, before a powerful 
body of men from Marblehead and Salem was at their 
heels, and must, if they had happened to be up one 
hour sooner, inevitably have intercepted their retreat to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a>. Unhappy it is, though, to reflect, that a 
brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, 
and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America 
are either to be drenched with blood, or inhabited by 
slaves. Sad alternative ! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice ? 
</p><p>
I am with sincere regard, and affectionate compliments to Mrs. Fairfax, dear 'Sir, your &,c.
