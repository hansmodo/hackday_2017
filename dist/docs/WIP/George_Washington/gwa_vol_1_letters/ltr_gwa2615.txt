SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you, I have received, by Mr. Spiltdorph, the letter therein alluded to, the contents of 
which are nearly the same as in the one received from the Virginia regiment, and left Captain Mackay with his company to guard 
Fort Necessity. Thus the difficulty ahout command was for the time removed. He advanced slowly as far as Gist's house, thirteen miles from 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, employing the soldiers on the way in repairing the 
road, and sending out scouting parties to watch the motions of the French. 
In the mean time, he held councils with several Indian chiefs, who came to 
him for that purpose, delivered speeches, exchanged belts of wampum, and 
went through the usual ceremonies on such occasions. But all to little 
purpose, for some of the Indians were treacherous spies from the French, 
and others had no higher motive than that of obtaining presents of goods 
and provisions. In this mode of gaining friends, the French were much 
the most successful, as they were better supplied with all the articles 
wanted by the Indians. A party of men was likewise despatched to clear 
the road beyond Gist's house, towards the junction of Red-stone Creek 
with the Monongahela.
