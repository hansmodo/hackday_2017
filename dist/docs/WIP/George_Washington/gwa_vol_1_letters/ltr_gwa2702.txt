TO MAJOR FRANCIS HALKET, BRIGADE MAJOR.

Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 2 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

MY DEAR HALKET, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a conference with Colonel 
Bouquet. I find him fixed, I think I may say unalterably fixed, to lead you a new way to the Ohio, through a 
road, every inch of which is to be cut at this advanced 
season, when we have scarce time left to tread the 
beaten track, universally confessed to be the best passage through the mountains. 
</p><p>
If Colonel Bouquet succeeds in this point with the 
General, all is lost, all is lost indeed, our enterprise 
will be ruined, and we shall be stopped at the Laurel 
Hill this winter ; but not to gather laurels, except of the 
kind that covers the mountains. The southern Indians 
will turn against us, and these colonies will be desolated by such an accession to the enemy's strength. 
These must be the consequences of a miscarriage ; and 
a miscarriage is the almost necessary consequence of an 
attempt to march the army by this new route. I have 
given my reasons at large to Colonel Bouquet. He desired 
that I would do so, that he might forward them to the 
General. Should this happen, you will be able to judge 
of their weight. 
</p><p>
I am uninfluenced by prejudice, having no hopes or 
fears but for the general good. Of this you may be assured, and that my sincere sentiments are spoken on 
this occasion. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Halket, most affectionately yours. 
</p>
