<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 4 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
Giving the necessary orders and directions, about the 
chain of forts to be built on the frontiers, has kept me 
so closely employed, that I could not write fully to yoi 
until this time. But I have got that trouble now pretty 
well off my hands, as I have despatched orders, plans, 
and tools to all the officers appointed to that duty. 
</p><p>
By the enclosed proceedings of a council held at Fort 
Cumberland, you will see our determination, and where 
it is necessary to erect the forts. Although we have not 
kept strictly to the act of Assembly, I hope it will be 
overlooked, as I am sensible that this will be the best 
chain that can possibly be erected ior the defence of the 
people, and that the Assembly aimed at that, but, being 
unacquainted with the situation of the country, had fallen into an error.
</p><p>
I make no doubt, that you have ere this heard of the 
defeat of Lieutenant Rutherford of the Rangers, escorting an express to me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and of the 
dastardly behaviour of the militia, who ran off without 
one half of them having discharged their pieces, although they were apprised of the ambuscade by one of 
the flanking parties, before the Indians fired upon them ; 
and ran back to Ashby's Fort, contrary to orders, persuasions, and threats. They are all ordered in, as soon 
as the people have secured their harvest. Those of 
King George and Caroline counties are already here. 
The rest I expect shortly. Through the passive behaviour of their officers they are very refractory. 
</p><p>
There is an act of Parliament to allow all servants to enlist, and the owners to be paid a reasonable allowance 
for them. If we had this privilege, we could soon complete the regiment; and I doubt not but his Majesty would order them to be paid for, if we enlisted them, as 
soon as for the regulars ; nay, should he not, the ten pounds' fine through the country would go a considerable way towards it. And this we may depend upon 
if we have not this liberty granted us, the servants will all run off to the regular officers, who are recruiting around us ; and that would be to weaken our colony 
much, when it could receive no immediate benefit from it. For my part, I see no other expedient.  
</p><p>
You perceive plainly what effect the act of Assembly, 
in regard to the drafts, has had, and how little our 
strength has been augmented by that scheme, and in 
three or four months we shall not be the better for 
them. They are then to be discharged. 
</p><p>
I could wish we were clear of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. It 
takes a great part of our small force to garrison it, and I 
see no service that it renders to our colony ; for since 
the Indians have driven the inhabitants so low down, 
they do not hesitate to follow them as far as Conococheague and this place. There have been several 
families murdered within two miles of the mouth of 
Conococheague, on the Maryland side, this week ; and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is now so much out of the way, that 
the forces there seldom hear of those things within a 
month after they are done. 
</p><p>
Our men want many necessaries, until the arrival of 
their regimentals, which cannot be had without sending 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; and the great loss, which we shall suffer by sending our paper money for them, has prevented 
my purchasing them, until the men are almost naked. 
</p><p>
I could by no means bring the Quakers to any terms. 
They chose rather to be whipped to death than to bear 
arms, or lend us any assistance whatever upon the fort, 
or any thing for self-defence. Some of their friends have been security for their appearance, when they 
shall be called for ; and I have released them from the guard-house until I receive further orders from you, which they have agreed to apply for. 
</p><p>
I have supplied the Nottoway Indians with some necessaries, and allowed them to take their arms with them ; but they 'have received no pay, and they say
they were promised a bit per day. Captain Toi has promised to go to the Tuscaroras with a speech and wampum, which I have given him. He says the; have a hundred fighting-men to spare. They would be a great assistance to us, if they could be engaged to come. 
</p><p>
I observe your proposal to Lord Loudoun of carrying 
on an expedition against the Ohio. I have always 
thought it the best and only method to put a stop to the 
incursions of the enemy, as they would then be obliged 
to stay at home to defend their ow r n possessions. But 
we are quite unprepared for such an undertaking. If it 
is fixed upon, now is the time for buying up provisions, 
and laying them in at the most convenient places. The 
Pennsylvania butchers are buying quantities of beef here, 
which should be put a stop to, if we are to march towards the Ohio. If we are still to remain on the defensive, and garrison the chain of forts, provisions must 
be laid in at each of them ; and I much fear, if we march 
from the frontiers, all the inhabitants will quit their plantations. Your sentiments and orders on this head will 
be very agreeable to me, and shall be punctually complied with. I am, &,c.
