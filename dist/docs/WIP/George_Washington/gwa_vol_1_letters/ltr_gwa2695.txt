<p>
TO FRANCIS FAUQUIER, LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Although but little skilled in compliments, permit me nevertheless to offer your Honor my congratulations on your appointment, and your safe arrival at a government, which his Majesty has been pleased to entrust to your administration. 
</p><p>
I flattered myself with the hope of seeing your Honor at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> when I was down, but the business, 
which carried me there, was of too urgent a nature to admit delay on my part, after it was accomplished. 
Mr. President Blair has no doubt informed you of the nature of that business, and the state of the troops here, 
and, generally, of the situation of affairs in this quarter. I will not, therefore, trouble you with a repetition of these 
particulars, but enclose to you a copy of the last orders, which I have received, and which I am preparing to execute with the greatest exactness. 
</p><p>
Sir John St. Clair set out for Conococheague on the 
12th instant, to which place I accompanied him, in consequence of a summons from Colonel Bouquet. He 
proceeded on to Carlisle, and I returned to this post, where at present I have the honor to command. 
</p><p>
When I was last in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, I endeavoured to 
make Mr. President Blair and the Council sensible of 
the great want of clothing for the first regiment, and 
how necessary it was to send to England for a supply. 
They declined doing any thing in the matter at that 
time, because the funds granted by the late Assembly 
were almost exhausted. But I hope it will not escape 
your Honor's notice, if another Assembly should soon 
be called. Field-equipage of all kinds will also be 
wanted, and will be better and come much cheaper 
from England, than it can be had in this country. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.f 
</p>
