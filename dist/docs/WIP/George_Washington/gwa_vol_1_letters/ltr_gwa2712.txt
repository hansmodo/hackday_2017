<p>
TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, 28 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, or the ground rather on which it stood, was 
possessed by his Majesty's troops on the 25th instant. 
The enemy, after letting us get within a day's march of the place, burned the fort, and ran away by the light of 
it, at night, going down the Ohio by water, to the number of about five hundred men, according to our best 
information. This possession of the fort has been matter of surprise to the whole army, and we cannot attribute it to more probable causes, than the weakness of 
the enemy, want of provisions, and the defection of their 
Indians. Of these circumstances we were luckily informed by three prisoners, who providentially fell into 
our hands at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, when we despaired of proceeding further. A council of war had determined, that 
it was not advisable to advance this season beyond that 
place; but the above information caused us to march on 
without tents or baggage, and with only a light train of 
artillery. We have thus happily succeeded. It would 
be tedious, and I think unnecessary, to relate every 
trivial circumstance, that has happened since my last 
To do this, if needful, shall be the employment of a 
leisure hour, when I shall have the pleasure to pay my 
respects to your Honor. 
</p><p>
The General intends to wait here a few days to settle 
matters with the Indians, and then all the troops, except 
a sufficient garrison to secure the place, will march to 
their respective governments. I give your Honor this 
early notice, that your directions relative to the troops 
of Virginia may meet me on the road. I cannot help 
reminding you, in this place, of the hardships they have 
undergone, and of their present naked condition, that 
you may judge if it is not essential for them to have 
some little recess from fatigue, and time to provide 
themselves with necessaries. At present they- are destitute of every comfort of life. If I do not get your orders 
to the contrary, I shall march the troops under my command directly to Winchester. They may then be disposed of, as you shall afterwards direct. 
</p><p>
General Forbes desires me to inform you, that he is 
prevented, by a multiplicity of affairs, from writing to 
you so fully now, as he would otherwise have done. 
He has written to the commanding officers stationed on 
the communication from hence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, relative 
to the conduct of the Little Carpenter, a chief of the 
Cherokees, the purport of which was to desire, that 
they would escort him from one place to another, to 
prevent his doing any mischief to the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
This fortunate, and, indeed, unexpected success of 
our arms will be attended with happy effects. The 
Delawares are suing for peace, and I doubt not that 
other tribes on the Ohio will follow their example. A 
trade, free, open, and on equitable terms, is what they 
seem much to desire, and I do not know so effectual a 
way of riveting them to our interest, as by sending out 
goods immediately to this place for that purpose. It 
will, at the same time, be a means of supplying the garrision with such necessaries as may be wanted ; and, I 
think, the other colonies, which are as greatly interested 
in the support of this place as Virginia, should neglect 
no means in their power to establish and maintain a 
strong garrison here. Our business, without this precaution, will be but half finished ; while, on the other 
hand, we shall obtain a firm and lasting peace with the 
Indians, if this end is once accomplished. 
</p><p>
General Forbes is very assiduous in getting these 
matters settled upon a solid basis, and has great merit 
for the happy issue to which he has brought our affairs, 
infirm and worn down as he is. At present I have 
nothing further to add, but the strongest assurances of 
my being your Honor's most obedient and most humble 
servant. 
</p>
