<p>
TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 19 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You are no stranger, I presume, to the late resolutions 
of the Governor and Council, the consequence of which 
I meditate with great concern. We are ordered to reinforce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with one hundred men, and, to 
enable me to carry that number thither, all the stockade 
forts on the Branch are to be evacuated, and in course 
all the settlements abandoned, except what lie under the 
immediate protection of Captain Waggener's fort, the 
only place exempted in their resolve. Surely his Honor 
and the Council are not fully acquainted with the situation and circumstances of the unhappy frontiers, thus to 
expose so valuable a tract as the Branch, in order to 
support a fortification, in itself of very little importance 
to the inhabitants or the colony. The former order of 
Council would have endangered not only the loss of Fort 
Loudoun, the stores, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, but a general removal of the settlers of this vale, even to the Blue Ridge. 
This last has the same object in view, namely, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and, to maintain it, the best lands in Virginia are 
laid open to the mercy of a cruel and inhuman enemy. 
</p><p>
These people have long struggled with the dangers 
of savage incursions, daily soliciting defence, and willing 
to keep their ground. To encourage them, all my little 
help has been administered, and they seemed satisfied 
with my intentions, resolving to continue while any probability of support remained. The disposition I had 
made of our small regiment gave general satisfaction to 
the settlements, and content began to appear everywhere. The necessary measures for provisions and 
stores were satisfactorily concerted, and every regulation 
established for the season. But the late order reverses, 
confuses, and incommodes every thing ; to say nothing 
of the extraordinary expense of carriage, disappointments, losses, and alterations, which must fall heavy on 
the country. Whence it arises, or why, I am truly ignorant; but my strongest representations of matters 
relative to the peace of the frontiers are disregarded, as 
idle and frivolous; my propositions and measures, as 
partial and selfish ; and all my sheerest endeavours for 
the service of my country are perverted to the worst 
purposes. My orders are dark, doubtful, and uncertain ; 
to-day approved, to-morrow condemned. Left to act 
and proceed at hazard, accountable for the consequences, and blamed without the benefit of defence, 
if you can think my situation capable of exciting the 
smallest degree of envy, or affording the least satisfaction, the truth is yet hidden from you, and you entertain 
notions very different from the reality of the case. 
However, I am determined to bear up under all these 
embarrassments some time longer, in hope of a better 
regulation on the arrival of Lord Loudoun, to whom I 
look for the future fate of Virginia. 
</p><p>
His Lordship, I think, has received impressions tending to my prejudice, by false representations of facts, if 
I may judge from a paragraph of one of his letters to 
the Governor, on which is founded the resolve to support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> at all events. The severity of 
the season, and nakedness of the soldiers, are matters 
of much compassion, and give rise to infinite complaints. 
Nor is it possible to obviate them, unless the clothing come in immediately. You would be surprised how 
the poor creatures live, much more how they can do 
duty. Had we but blankets, they might be appeased 
for a little time. As we have not, I fear many will 
desert. 
</p><p>
I advised you formerly of our necessity for cash, and 
I now earnestly request it soon. I think of sending down 
by the 10th of next month, or sooner if agreeable. 
Please to inform me upon what I may depend, as our 
men are impatient, and with some reason, when without 
both money and clothes. I need not urge the advantage of small bills. We shall have occasion for at least 
six thousand pounds to clear us to the 1st of January. 
The commissary wants above half that sum to furnish 
his stock of provisions. The remainder will be exhausted in paying the troops. We ought always to 
have money in hand, as we are often reduced to many 
inconveniences by waiting for it, not to mention the expense and trouble.
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obliged and affectionate humble servant.
