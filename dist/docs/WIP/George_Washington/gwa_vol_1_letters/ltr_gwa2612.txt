SIR,

The bearer hereof, Monsieur Drouillon, and Monsieur

to your particular notice, as prisoners of war, and officers 
whom I had the honor of taking.

I have assured them, that they will meet with all the 
respect and favor due to their character and personal 
merit ; and I hope they will do me the justice to inform you, that I have neglected no means in my power 
to render their confinement easy here.

sixteen privates, prisoners, to your Honor at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 
who will acquaint you with the profound respect with 
which I am your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant.
