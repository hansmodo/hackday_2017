SIR, 
</p><p>
I applied to the Governor for permission to go down 
and settle my accounts before he leaves the country, and 
to represent the melancholy situation of our distressed 
frontiers, which no written narrative can so well describe, as a verbal account to a judicious person inclined 
to hear. In conversation, the questions resulting from 
one relation beget others, till matters are perfectly understood; whereas the most explicit writing will be 
found deficient. But his Honor was pleased to deny 
his leave, thinking my request unreasonable, and that I 
had some party of pleasure in view. 
</p><p>
I have, in a letter to the Governor by this conveyance, endeavoured to set in as clear a light as I am able, the 
situation of our frontiers, and the disposition of the inhabitants ; and I shall aim also, in as succinct a manner 
as possible, to make you acquainted with the same. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of this fertile, and once populous valley, are now become our most western settlers, save the 
few families that areforted on the Branch. The enemy 
have, in a great measure, ceased committing hostilities 
on the Branch, and fallen upon the people of this valley, 
and a considerable part of them have already removed. 
This, by persons unacquainted with the country, and 
the enemy we have to deal with, may be attributed to 
the cowardice of the inhabitants, or inactivity of the soldiers, but by others it will be imputed to neither. No 
troops in the universe can guard against the cunning 
and wiles of Indians. No one can tell where they will 
fall, till the mischief is done, and then it is in vain to 
pursue. The inhabitants see, and are convinced of this, 
which makes each family afraid of standing in the gap 
of danger ; and by retreating, one behind another, they 
depopulate the country, and leave it to the enemy, who 
subsist upon the plunder. 
</p><p>
If we pursue a defensive plan next campaign, there 
will not, by the autumn, be one soul living on this side 
of the Blue Ridge, except the soldiers in garrison, and 
such of the inhabitants as may seek shelter therein. 
This, Sir, I know to be the immovable determination of 
the people ; and, believe me, I have been at great pains, 
before I could prevail on them to wait the consultations 
of this winter, and the events of the spring. 
</p><p>
I do not know on whom these miserable, undone 
people are to rely for protection. If the Assembly are 
to give it to them, it is time that measures were at least 
concerting, and not when they ought to be going into execution, as has always been the case. If they are to seek 
it from the Commander-in-chief, it is time their condition was made known to him ; for I cannot forbear repeating again, that while we pursue defensive measures 
we pursue inevitable ruin, the loss of the country being 
the inevitable and fatal consequence. There will be 
no end to our troubles, while we follow this plan, and 
every year will increase our expense. This, my dear 
Sir, I urge not only as an officer, but as a friend, 
who has property in the country and is unwilling to 
lose it. This it is, also, that makes me anxious for 
doing more than barely to represent these matters, 
which is all that is expected of an officer commanding. 
</p><p>
It is not possible for me to convey a just sense of the posture of our affairs. It would be vain to attempt it 
I, therefore, content myself with entreating you to use 
'our influence to prevent such delays, as we have 
dtherto met with, if you think this affair depends on 
the Assembly. If you think the Assembly have done 
all in their power, and that recourse must be had elsewhere, I am determined, as I will spare neither cost nor 
pains, to apply to Colonel Stanwix (who commands in 
this quarter, with whom I am acquainted, and from 
whom I have received several kind and affectionate letters,) for leave to wait on him with an account of our 
circumstances. Through these means, perhaps, we 
may be able to draw a little of Lord Loudoun's attention 
to the preservation of these colonies. 
</p><p>
Pray let me have your sentiments. I have not time to put my thoughts in a proper dress. The bearer is 
waiting, and I am in other respects hurried. But the truth of what I have asserted, believe me, is unquestionable ; as well as that I am, with the most affectionate 
regards, your most obedient servant and friend.
