TO COLONEL JOSHUA FRY. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 29 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
This is by an immediate express, whom I send to 
inform you, that yesterday I engaged a party of French, 
whereof ten were killed, one wounded, and twenty-one 
taken, with the loss of only one of mine killed and two or 
three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant Waggener. 
By some of their papers we can discover, that large 
detachments are expected every day, which we may 
reasonably suppose are to attack us, especially since we 
have begun. 
</p><p>
This is therefore to acquaint you with the necessity 
of a reinforcement, which I hope you will detach immediately, as you can be in no manner of danger in your 
march ; for the French must pass our camp, which I 
flatter myself is not practicable without my having intelligence of it, especially as there will be Indians always 
scouting. If a sufficient reinforcement does not come, 
we must either quit our ground and retreat to you, or fight very unequal numbers, which I will do, before I 
will give up one inch of what we have gained. The 
great haste I am in, to despatch the bearer, prevents me 
from being particular at this time. I shall conclude, Sir, 
with assuring you how sincerely concerned I am for 
your indisposition, which I hope you will soon recover 
from, and be able to join us, with the artillery, that we 
may attack the French in their forts. I am, &,c. 
</p>
