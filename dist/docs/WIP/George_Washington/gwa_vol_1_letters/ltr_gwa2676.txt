<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 17 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 2d instant came safe to hand, and Jenkins's sickness has prevented my answering it sooner. 
</p><p>
I apprehend, that thirteen of the twenty -nine drafts 
from Lunenburg have deserted, as sixteen only have arrived here, and I have no accounts of any more being 
on their march. Your Honor may observe by the enclosed list of deserters, all of whom have left the regiment since the last return, and after having received 
their clothes, arms, and bounty money, how prevalent 
still is that infamous practice among the dastardly drafts, 
especially at this garrison, where I indulge them in 
every thing but idleness, and in that I cannot, the nature 
of the work requiring the contrary. Lenity, so far from 
producing its desired effects, rather emboldens them in 
these villanous acts. One of those condemned to be 
hanged, deserted immediately upon receiving his pardon. In short, they tire my patience, and almost weary 
me to death. The expense of pursuing them is very 
considerable, and to suffer them to escape, without pursuit, is giving up the point, although we have had but 
little success of late. 
</p><p>
The uncertain and difficult communication with the 
out-posts must apologize for my not sending you a return of our strength for August. The second month 
will always be far advanced, before I can get in the returns of the preceding, as the month must be first expired, before the returns can be made out, and then 
some of them are to come two hundred and fifty miles, and great part of that distance through an uninhabited country. 
</p><p>
If special messengers are always sent with these returns, it will be a considerable expense. I should therefore be glad if your Honor would be pleased to direct, 
whether they are to be sent to me by express, or by 
the best casual conveyance. In the one case, as I before said, there must be a constant expense, and in the 
other, great uncertainty. By the enclosed return for 
July, you will see that our total strength amounted to 
six hundred and ninety-nine ; but, as many changes and 
casualties happened in that month, by reason of the 
drafts joining, deserting, and the companies not being 
properly formed, this return will, I apprehend, appear 
confused and irregular. Our present strength, I think, 
is about seven hundred. Major Lewis did, as he wrote 
you, march from this place with about one hundred and 
forty men only ; but then Captain Woodward, who also 
marched at the same time, with his company from the 
South Branch, joined him at Dickinson's; and these 
troops, with the men under Captain Hogg, formed a 
body of something more than two hundred and fifty 
men, agreeably to the number appointed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
for the forts at Dickinson's and Vass's. 
</p><p>
I never expected, nor ever desired, that there should 
be an addition made to the number of those persons 
appointed to transact public business, much less that 
there should be one to settle every little affair. I only 
humbly proposed, that, as Captain Gist was empowered 
with your Honor's approbation to manage the Indian 
affairs here, and as he is to be paid for that duty by 
this colony, he should, as a more proper person than 
myself, take in and adjust the accounts against the Indians, so often mentioned, since it cannot reasonably be 
supposed that I, who am stripped of the help I once 
was allowed, and told that I should be freed from these 
things in consequence, can turn my hands and thoughts 
to such a multiplicity of business, as naturally arises ou 
of the variety of occurrences, occasioned by our scat 
tered and detached situation and the many extraneou 
concerns of the Indians. Every person, who sees ho 
I am employed, will readily testify, that very little re 
creation falls to my lot. Nevertheless, if it is yo 
order, that I shall collect these accounts, I will do it 
the best manner I am able, and that with cheerfulness ; 
but it will be some time before it can be accomplished, 
as I have turned them off once. 
</p><p>
The Indian chiefs, before they departed for their nation, warmly solicited me for some drums ; and, as I 
had none but those belonging to the regiment, which 
could not be spared, I was obliged to promise them, 
that I would acquaint your Honor with their request, 
that you might, if you thought proper, provide them 
against their return. 
</p><p>
Since my last, the enemy came to the Branch, where 
they killed four men, wounded one, captured a man and 
a woman, and burned some grain, notwithstanding the 
utmost efforts of the troops, who are constantly scouting. 
The people in that quarter are terribly frightened by 
this last irruption, and I fear can hardly be prevented 
from deserting that valuable settlement. 
</p><p>
When your Honor shall be pleased to order the vacancy, occasioned by the death of Captain Spotswood, 
to be filled up with the name of Captain M c Neil, there 
will be room for a lieutenant ; and should you bestow the 
commission on Mr. Fairfax, I shall take it infinitely kind, 
if you will oblige me so far as to send it immediately 
from yourself to that gentleman. Although I esteem 
him greatly on account of his father, for whose memory 
and friendship I shall ever retain a most grateful regard, 
yet, making him lieutenant over so many ensigns of long 
standing, will occasion great confusion in the corps, and 
bring censure on me ; for the officers will readily conceive, that my friendship and partiality for the family 
were the causes of it. If Mr. Fairfax would accept of 
an ensigncy, the matter might pretty easily be accommodated. The letter under cover to Colonel Fairfax is 
not yet come to hand. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing yet from Colonel Stanwix ; but soon shall, as I wrote to him a few days ago, and expect his answer. 
</p><p>
As we have not at this time either commissary or assistant here, it is not in my power to send a return of 
the provisions with any tolerable exactness. But I do 
not doubt, that Mr. Rutherford, our acting commissary, 
who is now below, has satisfied your Honor fully in 
this particular ; if he has not, I will take care to do it 
in my next. 
</p><p>
I doubt not your Honor will see the necessity of making an agreement with the contractors, for furnishing the 
Indians with provisions; otherwise they will take no 
concern in this matter. I conceive they are allowed a 
certain amount for each soldier, that shall be returned, 
and that Indians are included. If not, no persons will 
supply them on the same terms, that they do soldiers, 
for Indians eat and w r aste triple as much as soldiers. 
</p><p>
I am your Honor's, &,c. 
</p>
