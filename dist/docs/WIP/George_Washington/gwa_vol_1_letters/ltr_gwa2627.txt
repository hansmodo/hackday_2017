HONORED MADAM, 
</p><p>
As I doubt not but you have heard of our defeat, and, 
perhaps, had it represented in a worse light, if possible, 
than it deserves, I have taken this earliest opportunity 
to give you some account of the engagement as it happened, within ten miles of the French fort, on Wednesday the 9th instant. 
</p><p>
We marched to that place, without any considerable 
loss, having only now and then a straggler picked up by 
the French and scouting Indians. When we came there, 
we were attacked by a party of French and Indians, 
whose number, I am persuaded, did not exceed three hundred men; while ours consisted of about one thousand 
three hundred well-armed troops, chiefly regular soldiers, 
who were struck with such a panic, that they behaved 
with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive. The 
officers behaved gallantly, in order to encourage their 
men, for which they suffered greatly, there being near 
sixty killed and wounded; a large proportion of the 
number we had. 
</p><p>
The Virginia troops showed a good deal of bravery, 
and were nearly all killed ; for I believe, out of three 
companies that were there, scarcely thirty men are left 
alive. Captain Peyrouny, and all his officers down to a 
corporal, were killed. Captain Poison had nearly as 
hard a fate, for only one of his was left, f In short, the 
dastardly behaviour of those they call regulars exposed 
all others, that were inclined to do their duty, to almost 
certain death ; and, at last, in despite of all the efforts 
of the officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pursued by dogs, and it was impossible to rally them. 
</p><p>
The General was wounded, of which he died three days after. Sir Peter Halket was killed in the field, 
where died many other brave officers. I luckily escaped without a wound, though I had four 'bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me. Captains Orme and Morris, two of the aids-de-camp, were wounded 
early in the engagement, which rendered the duty harder upon me, as I was the only person then left to 
distribute the General's orders, which I was scarcely able to do, as I was not half recovered from a violent illness, that had confined me to my bed and a wagon for 
above ten days. I am still in a weak and feeble condition, which induces me to halt here two or three days 
in the hope of recovering a little strength, to enable me 
to proceed homewards ; from whence, I fear, I shall not 
be able to stir till towards September ; so that I shall 
not have the pleasure of seeing you till then, unless it 
be in Fairfax. Please to give my love to Mr. Lewis 
and my sister; and compliments to Mr. Jackson, and 
all other friends that inquire after me. I am, honored 
Madam, your most dutiful son.
