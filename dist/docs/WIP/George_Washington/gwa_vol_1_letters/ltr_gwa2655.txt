TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER AND TREASURER.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 5 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> at present contains all our provisions and valuable stores, and is not capable of an hour's 
defence, if the enemy were only to bring a single halfpounder against it; which they might do with great 
ease on horseback. Besides, it lies so remote from this 
place, as well as from the neighbouring inhabitants, that 
it requires as much force to keep the communication 
open to it, as a fort at the Meadows would do, and employs one hundred and fifty men, who are a dead charge 
to the country, as they can be of no other use than just 
to protect and guard the stores, which might as well be 
lodged at Cox's Fort ;  indeed better, for they would 
then be more contiguous to this place, to the inhabitants, 
and to the enemy, and more serviceable, if we should 
ever carry an expedition over the mountains, by opening 
a road where the Indians have blazed, t A strong garrison there would not only protect the stores, but also 
the few remaining inhabitants on the Branch, t and at the 
same time waylay and annoy the enemy, as they pass 
and repass the mountains. Whereas, the forces at Fort 
Cumberland, lying in a corner quite remote from the inhabited parts, to which the Indians always repair to 
commit their murders, can have no intelligence of any 
thing that is doing, but remain in total ignorance of all 
transactions. When I was down, I applied to the Governor for his particular and positive directions in this affair. The following is an exact copy of his answer. 
" <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is a King's fort, and built chiefly at 
the charge of the colony, therefore properly under our 
direction, until a governor is appointed." Now whether 
I am to understand this ay or no, to the plain, simpl< 
question asked, " Is the fort to be continued or removed 1" I know not. But in all important matters 
I am directed in this ambiguous and uncertain way. 
</p><p>
Great and inconceivable difficulties arise in the execution of my commands, as well as infinite loss and disrepute to the service, by my not having power to pay 
for deserters. I would, therefore, humbly recommend it 
to the consideration of the Committee, whether it would 
not be more for the interest of the country, were I allowed to pay these demands, rather than have them 
levied in the public claims. Many of our deserters are 
apprehended in Maryland, and some in Pennsylvania, 
and, for the sake of the reward, are brought hither. But 
since they, who apprehend them, are to receive certificates only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds 
of tobacco, and those certificates are to be presented to 
a court of claims, there to lie perhaps till they are quite 
forgotten, so much dissatisfaction is created, that many, 
I believe, rather than apprehend one, would aid fifty 
to escape, and this, too, among our own people. 
</p><p>
Another thing, which I should be glad to know, is, 
whether the act of Assembly prohibits the whole forces, 
or only the drafts, from marching out of Virginia, and 
whether it is contrary to law, even to take the drafts out, 
provided it is done with their own consent. If we cannot take any of the forces out of the colony, the disadvantages, which the country may labor under, are not to 
be described ; for the enemy, in that case, may commit 
the most unheard-of cruelties, and, by stepping across 
the Potomac, evade pursuit, and mock our best endeavours to scourge them. 
</p><p>
The inconveniences that arise from paying the soldiers in large bills, are not to be conceived. We are 
obliged to give the pay of two or three soldiers to one 
man. He, ten to one, drinks, games, or pays it away ; 
by which means the parties are all dissatisfied, and perpetually complaining for want of their pay. It also 
prevents them from laying out their pay for absolute 
necessaries, and obliges them many times to drink it 
out ; for they put it into the tavern-keeper's hands, who 
will give no change, unless they will consent to receive 
the greatest part in liquor. In short, for five shillings 
cash you may at any time purchase^ a month's pay from 
the soldiers ; in such contempt do they hold the currency. Besides small bills, if the thing is practicable, I 
should be extremely glad to receive some part of the 
money in Spanish and Portugal gold and silver. Many 
things are wanted for the use of the regiment, which 
cannot be had here, and may be obtained at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>; but the depreciation of our money, out of the 
colony, has prevented my sending thither. 
</p><p>
At the repeated instances of the soldiers, I must pay 
so much regard to their representations, as to transmit 
their complaints. They think it extremely hard, as it is 
indeed, Sir, that they, who perhaps do more duty, and 
undergo more fatigue and hardship, from the nature of 
the service and situation of the country, than any other 
troops on the continent, should be allowed the least pay, 
and smallest encouragements in other respects. The 
Carolinians receive British pay ; the Marylanders, I believe, the same ; Pennsylvania is exorbitant in rewarding 
her soldiers ; as to the Jerseys and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I am not 
informed ; but the New England governments give more 
than a shilling per day, our money, besides an allowance of rum, pease, tobacco, vinegar, ginger, and the lik( 
</p><p>
Our soldiers complain, that their pay is insufficient, 
even to furnish shoes, shirts, and stockings, which theii 
officers, in order to keep them fit for duty, oblige them 
to provide. This, they say, deprives them of the means 
of purchasing any of the conveniences or necessaries of 
life, and compels them to drag through a disagreeable 
service, in the most disagreeable manner. That their 
pay will not afford more than enough to keep them in 
clothes, I should be convinced for these reasons, if experience had not taught me. The British soldiers are 
allowed eight pence sterling per day, with many necessaries that ours are not, and can buy what is requisite 
upon the cheapest terms ; and they lie one half the year 
in camp, or garrison, when they cannot consume the 
fifth part of what ours do in continual marches over 
mountains, rocks, and rivers. Then, Sir, is it possible 
that our men, who receive a fourth less, have two pence 
per day stopped for their regimental clothing, and all 
other stoppages made that British soldiers have, and are 
obliged, by being in continual action, to lay in triple the 
quantity of ammunition and clothes, and at double the 
price, should be able to clear themselves ? It is not to 
be done, and this is the reason why the men have 
always been so bare of clothes. 
</p><p>
And I dare say you will be candid enough to allow, 
that few men would choose to have their lives exposed 
to the incessant insults of a merciless enemy, without 
some view or hope of a reward. Another thing gives 
them great uneasiness, and that is, seeing no regular 
provision made for the maimed and wounded. They acknowledge the generosity of the Assembly, and have 
the highest veneration for that respectable House ; they 
look with gratitude on the care, which has been taken 
of their brother soldiers ; but they say, this is only an 
act of will, and another Assembly may be much less 
liberal. They have no certainty, that this generosity 
will continue, and consequently can have nothing in 
view but the most gloomy prospects, and no encouragement to be bold and active ; for as soon as they become 
unfit for service by their wounds, they may be discharged, and turned upon an uncharitable world to beg, 
steal, or starve. In short, they have a true sense of all 
that can happen, and do not think slightly of the fatigues 
they encounter, in scouring these mountains with their 
provisions on their backs, lying out and watching for the 
enemy, with no other covering to shelter them from the 
inclemency of the weather, than the trees and rocks. 
The old soldiers are affected, and complain of their 
hardships and little encouragement in piteous terms ; 
and they give these as reasons for so much desertion. 
The money expended in paying for deserters, expresses, horse-hire, losses and abuse of horses, would 
go a great length towards advancing their pay, which I 
hope would contribute not a little to remove the cause of this expense. 
</p><p>
I would not have it understood, however, that I mean 
to recommend any thing extraordinary ; no, I would 
give them British pay, and allow them the same privileges during their stay in the service, and this as a 
reward or compliment for their toil, rather than a matter 
of right. Were the country to give them one suit of 
regimental clothes a year, without receiving the two 
pence stoppage, it would be a full allowance, and cause 
great content and satisfaction. All they want is to be 
entitled to the privileges and immunities of soldiers, of which they are well informed, by some who have been 
a number of years in the army. They would then think 
it no hardship to be subject to the punishments and fatigues. Were this done, and an order given by the 
Committee empowering me to provide for them, according to the rules and customs of the army, I then shoul( 
know what I am about. I could do it without hesitation 
or fear, and, I am convinced, to the satisfaction and interest of the country. As the case now stands, we arc 
upon such an odd establishment, under such uncertaii 
regulations, and subject to so much inconvenience, that 
I am wandering hi a wilderness of difficulties, and am 
ignorant of the ways to extricate myself, and to act for 
the satisfaction of the country, the soldiers, or myself. 
Having no certain rules for the direction of my conduct, 
I am afraid to turn to this hand or to that, lest it should 
be censured. If such an order, as I before spoke of, 
were to issue from your Board, I would then immediately provide upon the best terms a quantity of all kinds 
of ammunition and clothes for the use of the regiment, 
and deliver them out to each company, as their wants 
required, taking care to deduct the value of all such 
things from their pay. By these means the soldiers 
would be always provided and fit for duty, and would 
do it cheerfully, and the country sustain no other loss, 
than advancing the money for a few months to lay in 
those stores, as this money would always be restored by the soldiers again.
</p><p>
I have hitherto been afraid to advance any sums of 
money for this salutary purpose, and have always bought 
the articles at extravagant prices, and been obliged to 
send to different parts, ere they could be had, which has also contributed to cause the nakedness of the soldiers. The officers are almost as uneasy and dispirited 
as the men, doing every part of duty with languor and 
indifference. When ordered to provide themselves 
with suitable necessaries, they complain of an uncertain 
establishment, and the probability of being disbanded, 
and the things rendered useless. So that I really and 
most heartily wish for a change. The surgeon has entreated me to mention his case, which I shall do by 
enclosing his letters. He has behaved extremely well, 
and discharged his duty, in every capacity, Since he 
came to the regiment. He has long discovered an inclination to quit the service, the encouragement being so 
small ; and I Relieve he would have done it, had not the 
officers, to show their regard and willingness to detain 
him, subscribed each one day's pay in every month. 
This, as they are likely to be so much dispersed, and 
can receive no benefit from him, they intend to withdraw, and therefore he begs me to solicit the gentlemen 
of the Committee in his behalf; otherwise he will be 
obliged to seek some other method of getting his livelihood. 
</p><p>
I beg, Sir, with very great earnestness, that the 
gentlemen of the Committee will communicate their 
sentiments fully upon all these several matters, and approve or disapprove every thing therein. I only wait to 
know their intention, and then to act in strict conformity 
with it. 
</p><p>
If the Committee find my account satisfactory and 
distinct, as I have no doubt they will, it would be conferring a great obligation, if they would make a final 
settlement to that date, and begin a new account, as it 
would be the means of keeping matters more clear and 
intelligible hereafter. Long accounts, and references to 
doubtful points, instead of gaining any light, are but darkened and confused by procrastination. The late 
regulation of our companies will occasion more regularity 
in the paymaster's account, and be more satisfactory in 
every shape, for the future. Besides, the gentlemen of 
the Committee will find little trouble, or difficulty, in 
looking over a short account, kept in a regular method, 
plain and perspicuous, which is the very life of business. 
I would again entreat your regard to my request, for 
these and many other reasons. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, yours, &,c.
