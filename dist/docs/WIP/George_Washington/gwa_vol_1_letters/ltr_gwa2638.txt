<p>
TO COLONEL ADAM STEPHEN. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 28 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your two letters by Jenkins last night, and was greatly surprised to hear that Commissary Walker was not arrived at camp, when he came away. He set 
out from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> about the 12th instant, with orders to proceed immediately up ; but such disobedience 
of commands, as I have generally met with, is insufferable, and shall not go unpunished. The account you 
enclosed of the method of receiving the beef, I suppose, is customary ; but for want of knowledge in those affairs, I can neither applaud nor condemn it. 
</p><p>
The Governor did not seem inclined to promote the removal of the fort; however, the Committee have lodged a discretionary power in my hands, and have 
resolved to pay for all extraordinary labor. I would, therefore, have as little labor lost at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> as possible ; at least, until I come up, which will be very 
shortly, my stay here being only for a few days, in order to receive recruits, and hurry up the stores to Winchester. 
</p><p>
I believe those, who say Governor Sharpe is to command, can only wish it. I do not know that General 
Shirley has a power to appoint a chief to our forces, to regulars he may. As to that affair of turning the store-house into a dwelling-room, I do not know what 
better answer to give, than saying, that this is one among the many instances, which might be offered, of the inconvenience of having the fort in Maryland. As 
soon as I hear from Governor Shirley, which is hourly expected, I can then send a more determinate answer. 
</p><p>
There has been such total negligence among the recruiting officers in general, such disregard of the service 
they were employed in, and such idle proceedings, that I am determined to send out none until we all meet, 
when each officer shall have his own men, and have 
only this alternative, either to complete his number, or 
lose his commission. Several officers have been out six 
weeks, or two months, without getting a man, spending 
their time in all the gayety of pleasurable mirth, with 
their relations and friends ; not attempting, nor having 
possible chance to recruit any but those, who, out of 
their inclination to the service, will proffer themselves. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to have ten or twelve wagons sent 
to this place. Salt enough may be had here to load that 
number, and it is obtained upon easier terms than at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, by sixpence or eight pence per bushel. 
Those stores at Watkins's Ferry should be hurried up 
as fast as the water affords opportunities, if it were only 
to prevent disputes. 
</p><p>
If the paymaster is at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and not on his 
way to Fort Dinwiddie, order him down here immediately. If he should be going with pay to Captain Hogg, 
he is to proceed with despatch ; but if he is at Fort 
Cumberland, order him down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, to wait 
there until I arrive. I am, &c.
</p>
