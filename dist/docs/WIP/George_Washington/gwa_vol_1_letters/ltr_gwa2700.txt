<p>
TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 21 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a> 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I had, before Colonel Stephen came to this place, abandoned all thoughts of attending personally the election at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, choosing rather to leave the 
management of that affair to my friends, than be absent from my regiment, when there is a probability of its 
being called to duty. I am much pleased now, that did so. Colonel Byrd has given me your letter of yesterday, in consequence of which I send you a return oi 
the forage. He writes to Mr. Gist, requesting him to send vermilion for the Indians. 
</p><p>
We participate in the joy felt for the success of Majesty's arms at Louisburg, but sincerely lament the loss of the brave, active, and noble Lord Howe. 
</p><p>
The bridge is finished at this place, and to-morrow 
Major Peachey, with three hundred men, will proceed 
to open General Braddock's road. I shall direct them 
to go to George's Creek, ten miles in advance. By that 
time I may possibly hear from you. If they go farther, 
it may be requisite to reinforce the party. But this 
matter, I suppose, will be ordered according to the route 
determined on by the General, for it will be needless to 
open a road, of which no use will be made afterwards. 
</p><p>
Colonel Stephen gives me some room to apprehend, 
that a body of light troops may soon move on. I pray 
your interest, most sincerely, with the General, to get 
my regiment and myself included in the number. If 
any argument is needed to obtain this favor, I hope 
without vanity I may be allowed to say, that, from long 
intimacy with these woods, and frequent scouting in 
them, my men are at least as well acquainted with all 
the passes and difficulties, as any troops that will be employed. 
</p><p>
The General directs, that the troops shall be provided 
with covers to their locks. Where to get them I know 
not. There is but one possible way, and that is, by 
taking the hides of the cattle, and they will fall short. 
The commissaries ask eighteen shillings apiece for hides. 
I should be glad of your advice on this subject. What is to be done with the wagons expected up in our next 
convoy ? I cannot exactly predict their number, but I suppose the provisions, forage, and stores, cannot employ less than fifty. 
</p><p>
I am, with very great regard, your most obedient and obliged humble servant. 
</p>
