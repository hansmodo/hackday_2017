DEAR STEWART, 
</p><p>
With some difficulty I have at last procured the enclosed, which you will please to make use of as occasion 
may require. I was upon the point of forwarding these, 
and my letters to London, when Colonel Hunter arrived, 
and informed me that he left you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and 
that your embarkation for England seemed to be a matter of doubt. I have, therefore, changed the route of 
these letters, now sending them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, to the 
care of Mr. Beverley Robinson. 
</p><p>
Signing the definitive treaty seems to be the only 
piece of news, which prevails here at present, and diffuses general joy. Our Assembly is suddenly called, in 
consequence of a memorial of the British merchants to 
the Board of Trade, representing the evil consequences 
of our paper emission, and their Lordships' report and 
orders thereupon, which, I suppose, will set the whole 
country in flames. This stir of the merchants seems to 
be ill-timed, and cannot be attended with any good effects, but, I fear, the contrary. However, on the 19th 
instant the Assembly will meet; and till then I will suspend my further opinion of the matter. 
</p><p>
I am, with the most unalterable regard, your most 
affectionate friend and servant. 
</p>
