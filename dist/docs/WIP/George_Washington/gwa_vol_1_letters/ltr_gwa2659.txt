<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a>, 10 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This day within five miles of the Carolina line, as I was proceeding to the southernmost fort in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a>, I 
met Major Lewis on his return from the Cherokees, with seven men and three women only of that nation. 
The causes of this unhappy disappointment I have desired him to communicate, that you may take measures 
accordingly. This account is sent by express, to give the earliest notice while the Assembly is sitting. 
</p><p>
I shall defer going into a particular detail of my observations on the situation of our frontiers, until I return 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, as I expect by that time to be more intimately acquainted with the unhappy circumstances of 
the people. Yet I shall not omit mentioning some occurrences, which have happened in my tour to this 
place. I wrote to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, that I should set out the next day for Augusta. I accordingly did so, 
September 29th, with Captain M c Neil ; and hearing at the Court-House, that the Indians still continued their 
. depredations, although not so openly as at first, I applied to Colonel Stewart, then present, to raise a party of the 
militia, and proposed to head them myself, march to Jackson's River, scour the woods, and, if possible, fall in 
with the enemy. He gave me very little encouragement to expect any men, yet desired I would wait four 
days, till Monday, and he would use his endeavours to collect a body. Until Tuesday I waited, and only five 
men appeared. This being too inconsiderable a number to expose to a triumphant enemy, I was advised to 
apply to Colonel Buchanan for men, between whom and Colonel Stewart there was contention about command. 
</p><p>
Colonel Buchanan resided at Luney's Ferry, on James River, sixty miles along the road to Vass's, on the Roanoke, w r here Captain Hogg was building a fort, and to 
which place I intended to proceed, if I could get men to range along the frontiers with me. I set out immediately for his house, attended by Captain Preston, who 
was kind enough to be my conductor; and I acquainted the Colonel with the motives that brought me thither. 
He told me with very great concern, that it was not in his power to raise men; for that, three days before, some 
of the militia, in a fort, about fifteen miles above his house, at the head of Catawba Creek, commanded by 
one Colonel Nash, were attacked by the Indians, which occasioned all that settlement to break up totally, even 
as far as the ferry at Luney's ; that he had ordered three companies to repair thither, and march against the 
enemy, and not one man came, except a captain, lieutenant, and seven or eight men from Bedford. 
</p><p>
Finding that it was impossible to get a party to range 
and scour the frontiers, it remained only to proceed 
without men to see the situation of the forts, or to return back. The latter I was loath to do, since I had 
come thus far, and was anxious to see what posture of 
defence they were in. I therefore determined to come 
forward, at least to Vass's, and accordingly set out in 
company with Colonel Buchanan, who, being desirous 
that I might see and relate their unhappy condition, undertook to accompany me. We arrived safely at Vass's, 
where Captain Hogg, with only eighteen of his company, 
was building a fort, which must employ him till Christmas, without more assistance. One Captain Hunt from 
Lunenburg, was there with thirty men ; but none of 
them would strike a stroke, unless I would engage to 
see them paid forty pounds of tobacco a day, which is 
provided by act of Assembly for militia carpenters. 
This I certainly could not do, as your Honor, who I 
thought had ordered them purposely out for this duty, 
had given no directions in the affair. Whatever expectations your Honor may have had from the militia's 
assistance, I am told they never lent a hand, save a few, 
that first came out with Captain Hogg, whom he has 
paid after the same rates with our men, at sixpence a 
day. Vass's place is a pass of very great importance, 
affording a road for the enemy, but secure, if strongly 
garrisoned. 
</p><p>
From Vass's I came off with a servant and a guide, 
to visit the range of forts in this county. In less than 
two hours after, two men were killed along the same 
road, as will appear by Captain M c Neil's letter, which I 
have just received, and herewith send, to let you see, 
by the account of Captain Hunt's behaviour, what dependence may be put on the militia. The inhabitants 
are so sensible of their danger, if left to the protection 
of these people, that not a man will stay at his place. 
This I have from their own mouths, and the principal 
persons of Augusta county. The militia are under such 
bad order and discipline, that they will go and come 
when and where they please, without regarding time, 
their officers, or the safety of the inhabitants, consulting 
solely their own inclinations. There should be, according to your orders, one third of the militia of these parts 
now on duty at once ; instead of that, I believe scarce 
one thirtieth is out. They are to be relieved every 
month. More than that time is taken up in marching 
to and from their stations, and they will not wait one 
day longer than the limited time, whether they are relieved or not, let the necessity for it be ever so urgent. 
An instance of this kind happened in my presence about 
four days ago, in the case of Captain Daniel from Albemarle, who was intreated by Colonel Buchanan to stay 
at the time he was gathering or attempting to gather 
men, upon the alarm at the Catawba settlement before 
mentioned. The Captain's month was out, and go he 
must and did. Nay, I believe I may venture to say, 
that, whether his month had been out or not, this circumstance would have induced him to go; for the same 
gentleman went away from Vass's, because he thought 
it a dangerous post, giving that for his reason, and left 
Captain Hogg with eighteen men, exposed to the insults 
of the enemy. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may be thought I am partial in my relation, 
and reflect unjustly. I really do not, Sir. I scorn to 
make unjust remarks on the behaviour of the militia, as 
much as I despise and contemn the persons, who detract from mine and the character of the regiment. 
Were it not, that I consult the good of the public, and think these garrisons merit attention, I should not 
deem it worth mentioning. I only wish to make the 
country sensible, how ardently I have studied to promote its cause, and desire very sincerely, that my successor may fill my place more to its satisfaction in every 
respect, than I have been able to do. I mentioned in 
my last, that I did not think a less number than two 
thousand men would be sufficient to defend our extensive and much exposed frontiers from the ravages of 
the enemy. I have not had one reason to alter my 
opinion, but many to strengthen and confirm it. And I 
flatter myself, that the country will, when my determinations are known, be convinced that I have no sinister 
views, no vain motives of commanding a number of men, 
which urge me to recommend this number, but that it 
proceeds from the knowledge I have acquired of the 
country and people to be defended. 
</p><p>
Your Honor, I hope, will give directions about laying 
in provisions on our southern frontiers. It is not in my 
pow r er to do it, as I know not what troops can or will be 
put there. The regiment is at present too weak to 
allow any men to march from the quarter in which they 
are now stationed. I shall set out this day on my return to the fort, at the head of Catawba Creek, where 
Colonel Buchanan promised to meet me with a party to 
conduct me along our frontiers, up Jackson's River to 
Fort Dinwiddie, and higher if needful. If he does not 
meet me, I shall immediately proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 
as it will be impossible to do any thing without men. 
</p><p>
If you think proper to advance the pay of the militia, 
in order to engage them to work, please to acquaint 
Captain Hogg therewith, and send him money for that 
purpose. Were more men ordered to cover his party, 
and assist in the work, it would be highly advantageous, for he is greatly exposed. Major Lewis is extremely unwell. 1 am hurried a good deal, but have 
given a plain account of all the several matters mentioned in the foregoing sheet. I am, &c.
