<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 19 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 10th came to hand the 15th; in 
consequence of which I despatched orders immediately 
to all the garrisons on the Branch to evacuate their forts, 
repair to Pearsall's, where they would meet the flour 
from this place, and escort it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I fear the provisions purchased for the support of these 
forts, and now lying in bulk, will be wasted and destroyed, notwithstanding I have given directions to the 
assistant commissary on the Branch, and to Waggener's 
company, to use their utmost diligence in collecting the 
whole, and securing them where his company is posted. 
An escort, with all the flour we have been able to procure (amounting to an insufficient quantity for want of 
water), will set out from this place on Tuesday next. 
I expect to depart sooner myself, leaving directions with 
Captain Mercer, whom I have appointed to command 
here, and I shall repair as expeditiously as possible to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
I am a little at a loss to understand the meaning of 
your orders, and the opinion of the Council, when I am 
directed to evacuate all the stockade forts, and at the 
same time to march only one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland, and to continue the like number here to 
garrison <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. If the stockade forts are all 
abandoned, there will be more men than are required 
for these two purposes, and the communication between 
them, of near eighty miles, will be left without a settler, 
unguarded and exposed. But I mean nothing more by 
this intimation, than to ascertain your intentions, to which 
I would willingly pay strict obedience. 
</p><p>
A return of the stores at this place is enclosed. I 
should have sent it before, but waited to add a return of 
those at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. None has yet come down. 
</p><p>
If Captain M c Neil goes to the Cherokee nation, it 
vvould be well for him to conduct the Catawbas home. 
But when I recommended an officer's going with them, 
it was with a view of engaging a body of their men to 
come to our assistance in the spring, and to march with 
their warriors, not choosing to trust altogether to their 
unmeaning promises and capricious humors. But you 
will be pleased to direct as you see proper in this affair. 
I have hitherto advanced very little money to the masters of servants, because I waited your directions. I 
received forty-one last night from Captain M c Neil, who 
desires leave to continue recruiting. I do not consent 
to it, until I know whether it is agreeable to you, and 
whether I may send out as many other officers as can 
be spared for the same service. 
</p><p>
I should have been exceedingly glad, if your Honor 
and the Council had directed in what manner Fort 
Cumberland is to be strengthened ; that is, whether it 
is to be made cannon-proof or not ; and that you would 
fix the sum beyond which we shall not go, for I must 
look to you for the expense. I have read that paragraph in Lord Loudoun's letter, which you were pleased 
to send me, over and over again, but am unable to comprehend its meaning. What scheme it was, that I was 
carrying into execution without waiting advice, I am at 
a loss to know, unless it was building the chain of forts 
along our frontiers, which I not only undertook conformably to an act of Assembly, and by your ow 
orders, but, with respect to the places, in pursuance of a 
council of war. If, under these circumstances, my 
conduct is responsible for the fate of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, it must be confessed, that I stand upon a tottering foundation indeed. I cannot charge my memory 
with either proposing, or intending, to draw the forts 
nearer Winchester. The garrison of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
it is true, I did wish to have removed to Cox's, which is 
nearer Winchester by twenty-five miles ; but not farther 
from the enemy, if a road were opened from thence to 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, which place is about twenty miles 
distant, and the same from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and more 
in the warriors' path. However, I see with much regret, 
that Lord Loudoun seems to have prejudged my proceedings, without being thoroughly informed of the 
springs and motives, that actuated my conduct. How 
far I have mistaken the means to recommend my services, I know not, but I am certain of this, that no man 
ever intended better, or studied the interest of his country with more zeal, than I have done ; and nothing gives 
me greater uneasiness and concern, than that his Lordship should have imbibed prejudices so unfavorable to 
my character, as to excite his belief that I was capable 
of doing any thing, " that will have a bad effect as to 
the Dominion, and no good appearance at home." 
</p><p>
As I had your permission to go down when his Lordship shall favor us with a visit, I desired Colonel Carlyle 
to inform me when he should pass through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 
and I will set out accordingly. I hope nothing has intervened to alter this indulgence. It is a favor I should 
not have thought of asking, had I believed the service 
would suffer in my absence, but I am convinced it will 
not. And I cannot help saying, I believe we are the 
only troops on this continent, that are kept summer and 
winter to the severest duty, without the least respite or 
indulgence. 
</p><p>
The delay of the soldiers' clothes occasions unac 
countable murmurs and complaints, and I am very much 
afraid we shall have few men left, if they arrive not in 
a week or two. You would be astonished to see the 
naked condition of the poor wretches. How they possibly can subsist, much less work, in such severe 
weather, is not easy to conceive. Had we but blankets 
to give them, or any thing to defend them from the cold, 
they might perhaps be easy. 
</p><p>
I have formerly hinted to you our necessity for a 
speedy supply of cash, and have advised with the 
Speaker likewise, that he may not be unprepared. I 
purpose to send down by the 10th of next month. 
</p><p>
I cannot furnish a return of our strength as yet, 
because our scattered disposition hinders a regular 
discharge of the adjutant's duty. I am, &c. 
</p>
