SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Honor's favor by Mr. Ward, who 
arrived here last night, just as two Indians came to us 
from the Ohio. 
</p><p>
These Indians contradict the report of the French 
having received reinforcements, though they agree that 
eight hundred men are very shortly expected. Those 
on the spot are busily employed in erecting the fort, 
which they have removed to the point I recommended 
for the country's use, whose walls they have now made 
two fathoms thick, and raised them breast high. 
</p><p>
They are daily sending out scouts, some of whom 
about five days ago were seen within six or seven miles 
of our camp ; but as I did not receive timely notice of 
it, they may have escaped, unless they have fallen in 
with a party sent out about eight days ago to Red- stone 
Creek, to reconnoitre the country thereabouts, and to 
get intelligence of the motions of the French. 
</p><p>
It is imagined that the Half-King will be here in two 
or three days, but to hurry him I have sent the Indian, 
that came up with Mr. Ward, with a short speech, 
acquainting him with my desire of his coming as expeditiously as possible, to receive the speech which your 
Honor sent by Mr. Ward, and which Colonel Fry wrote 
me I was to deliver. When he arrives I will endeavour 
to send him on to meet you at Winchester. 
</p><p>
These Indians, and all the traders that I have been 
able to get any information from, of late, agree that it is 
almost impracticable to open a road, in which a wagon 
can pass from this to Red-stone Creek. But most of 
them assure me, that, except at one place, water carriage may be had down this river, which will be a most 
advantageous discovery if it proves true, as it will save 
forty miles' land carriage over almost impassable roads 
and mountains. 
</p><p>
The water is now so high, that we cannot possibly 
cross over with our men, which likewise secures us from 
any immediate attacks of the enemy. I have therefore 
resolved to go down the river to the fall, which is at the 
Turkey Foot, to inform myself concerning the nature 
and difficulty attending this fall. I have provided a 
canoe, and shall, with an officer and five men, set out 
upon this discovery to-morrow morning. 
</p><p>
Captain Trent's men, who by their refractory behaviour obliged me to separate them from the other 
soldiers, have now left the New Store and dispersed, 
contrary to my positive orders till they received your commands. 
</p><p>
As I shall have frequent communications with the 
Indians, which are of no effect without wampum, I hope 
you will order some to be sent. Indeed, we ought to 
have shirts, and many other things of this sort, which 
are always expected by every Indian that brings a message, or good report Also the chiefs, who visit and 
converse in council, look for the same. If it would not 
be thought too bold in me, I would recommend some 
of the treaty goods to be sent for that purpose with 
Colonel Fry, or after him. This is the method the 
French pursue, and a trifle judiciously bestowed, and in 
season, may turn to our advantage. If I find this river 
navigable, I am convinced it cannot but be agreeable to 
your Honor, that we should build canoes in order to 
convey our artillery down. As the road to this place is 
made as good as it can be, much time and great labor 
having been spent upon it, I believe a wagon may 
travel now with fifteen or eighteen hundred weight, by 
doubling the teams at one or two places only. I am, &c. 
</p>
