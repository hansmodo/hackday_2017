</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now set dow r n to write to you on a subject of importance, and of no small embarrassment to me. My son-in-law and ward, Mr. Custis, has, as I have been informed, paid his addresses to your second daughter, 
and, having made some progress in her affections, has solicited her in marriage. How far a union of this sort may be agreeable to you, you best can tell ; but I should think myself wanting in candor, were I not to confess, 
that Miss Nelly's amiable qualities are acknowledged on all hands, and that an alliance with your family will be pleasing to his. 
</p><p>
This acknowledgment being made, you must permit me 
to add, Sir, that at this, or in any short time, his youth, 
inexperience, and unripened education, are, and will be, 
insuperable obstacles, in my opinion, to the completion of 
the marriage. As his guardian, I conceive it my indispensable duty to endeavour to carry him through a 
regular course of education (many branches of which, I 
am sorry to add, he is totally deficient in), and to guard 
his youth to a more advanced age before an event, on 
which his own peace and the happiness of another are 
to depend, takes place. Not that I have any doubt of 
the warmth of his affections, nor, I hope I may add, any 
fears of a change in them ; but at present I do not conceive that he is capable of bestowing that attention 
to the important consequences of the married state, which 
is necessary to be given by those, who are about to enter 
into it, and of course I am unwilling he should do it till 
he is. If the affection, which they have avowed for 
each other, is fixed upon a solid basis, it will receive no 
diminution in the course of two or three years, in which 
time he may prosecute his studies, and thereby render 
himself more deserving of the lady and useful to society. 
If, unfortunately, as they are both young, there should be 
an abatement of affection on either side, or both, it had 
better precede than follow marriage. 
</p><p>
Delivering my sentiments thus freely will not, I hope, 
lead you into a belief, that I am desirous of breaking off 
the match. To postpone it is all I have in view ; for I 
shall recommend to the young gentleman, with the 
warmth that becomes a man of honor, (notwithstanding 
he did not vouchsafe to consult either his mother or me 
on the occasion,) to consider himself as much engaged 
to your daughter, as if the indissoluble knot were tied ; and, as the surest means of effecting this, to apply 
himself closely to his studies, (and in this advice 
I flatter myself you will join me,) by which he will, 
in a great measure, avoid those little flirtations with 
other young ladies, that may, by dividing the attention, 
contribute not a little to divide the affection. 
</p><p>
It may be expected of me, perhaps, to say something 
of property ; but, to descend to particulars, at this time, 
must seem rather premature. In general, therefore, I 
shall inform you, that Mr. Custis's estate consists of 
about fifteen thousand acres of land, a good part of it 
adjoining the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and none of it 
forty miles from that place ; several lots in the said 
city ; between two and three hundred negroes ; and 
about eight or ten thousand pounds upon bond, and in 
the hands of his merchants. This estate he now holds 
independent of his mother's dower, which will be an 
addition to it at her death ; and, upon the whole, it ^s 
such an estate as you will readily acknowledge ought to 
entitle him to a handsome portion with a wife. But as 
I should never require a child of my own to make a 
sacrifice of himself to interest, so neither do I think it 
incumbent on me to recommend it as a guardian. 
</p><p>
At all times when you, Mrs. Calvert, or the young 
ladies, can make it convenient to favor us with a visit, 
we should be. happy in seeing you at this place. Mrs. Washington and Miss Custis join me in respectful compliments, and 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.
