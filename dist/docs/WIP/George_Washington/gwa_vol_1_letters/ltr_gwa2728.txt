SIR, 
</p><p>
Unseasonable as it may be, to take any notice of the repeal of the Stamp Act at this time, yet I cannot help 
observing, that a contrary measure would have introduced very unhappy consequences. Those, therefore, 
who wisely foresaw such an event, and were instrumental in procuring the repeal of the act, are, in my 
opinion, deservedly entitled to the thanks of the wellwishers to Britain and her colonies, and must reflect 
with pleasure, that, through their means, many scenes of confusion and distress have been prevented. Mine 
they accordingly have, and always shall have, for their opposition to any act of oppression ; and that act could 
be looked upon in no other light by every person, who would view it in its proper colors. 
</p><p>
I could wish it were in my power to congratulate 
you on the success of having the commercial system of 
these colonies put upon a more enlarged and extensive 
footing, than it is ; because I am well satisfied, that it 
would ultimately redound to the advantage of the mother 
country, so long as the colonies pursue trade and agriculture, and would be an effectual let to manufacturing 
among them. The money, which they raise, would 
centre in Great Britain, as certainly as the needle will 
settle to the pole. I am, &c.
