<p>
TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, 2 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
Urged by repeated applications from a number of 
officers, whom I have had the honor to command in the service of this colony, I take the liberty of addressing 
your Excellency on the subject of the lands, which the gentlemen conceive themselves entitled to under his 
Majesty's bounty of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. 
</p><p>
The exception in favor of the officers and soldiers, 
contained in his Majesty's order in Council, of the 6th 
of April last, they humbly conceive is so strong an implication of your Lordship's right to grant them these 
lands, as to remove every restraint you were under before ; and as there are no waste lands to be had in this 
colony, but such as lie upon the western waters, they 
humbly pray for leave to survey on the river Ohio, and 
its waters, below the mouth of Scioto (the western 
boundary of the new colony, should it ever take place), 
apprehending that your Excellency has an undoubted 
right to grant patents for these lands, since they have 
ever been considered as appertaining to Virginia, warranted, as they have been informed, by the Colony 
Charter, and sold by the Six Nations at the treaty of 
Fort Stanwix, in 1768. Nor is the right thereto, it is 
humbly presumed, by any means diminished by the 
nominal line, commonly called the Ministerial Line; 
since that transaction seems to have been considered by 
government as a temporary expedient, at the instigation 
of the Indian Agent, to satisfy the southern Indians, 
who, as it is said, have disclaimed any right to the very 
</p><p>
I do not mean to grant any patents on the western waters, as I do not 
think I am at present empowered so to do. I did, indeed, tell a poor old 
German lieutenant, who was with me, and informed me he was very poor, 
and had ten children, that I might possibly grant him a patent contiguous 
to that, which he had under Mr. Dinwiddie's proclamation, which I suppose 
is what may have given rise to the report you have heard. As to Captain 
Bullitt, I know nothing about his surveying any lands, and did, when I was 
at Fort Pitt, write to him and advise him to return again immediately.
