<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 23 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Under your kind indulgence I came to this place a 
few days ago, expecting to meet the executors of my 
deceased brother, in order to make a final settlement of 
his affairs. I was disappointed in this design, by the 
Assembly having called away the principal persons concerned. 
</p><p>
I shall remark, in obedience to your request, such 
things relating to the Virginia regiment as occur to me 
now, and require the Assembly's attention ; and if any 
thing further presents itself, I shall communicate it from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, for which place I shall set out this afternoon. I have often urged, for one thing, the necessity 
of enforcing the articles of war in all their parts, where 
it is not incompatible with the nature of this service. I 
have been surprised, as often as I have reflected upon this 
subject, and really cannot devise any reason, why the 
Assembly should be so much averse to fixed rules for 
the regulation of their forces, of which long experience 
in established armies fully evinces the necessity. My 
surprise is yet increased, when I consider how cautiously 
worded the act of Parliament is, to preserve the rights 
and liberties of the people against the arbitrary proceedings of the military officers. 
</p><p>
We are under a kind of regulation at present, that 
renders command extremely difficult and precarious, as 
no crimes, I believe, are particularly noticed in the act 
of Assembly, except mutiny and desertion, notwithstanding there are many others equally punishable by 
act of Parliament. 
</p><p>
One thing 'more, which particularly requires attention, is the billeting, quartering, and dieting of soldiers 
upon the inhabitants, which in many cases cannot be avoided. 
</p><p>
I have, in several letters to your Honor, expressed 
my opinion with candor and freedom, about the situation, works, and garrison at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I shall, 
nevertheless, as you command me to lay before you 
such things as require the Assembly's notice, repeat on 
this occasion my fears once more for that place, that I 
may avoid, if any accident should happen to it, the malicious reflections, which inseparably attend misfortunes 
of this kind. I have upon all occasions said, that Fort 
Cumberland is a place of no strength, and never can be 
tenable from the badness of the ground. It is far remote 
from any of our inhabitants, exposed to the insults of 
the enemy, contains all our valuable stores (save what 
I have removed to Winchester), and a garrison of one 
hundred and seventy men, which is too large a number 
to be spared from other places, merely to defend the 
stores at this, and too small to afford detachments to 
waylay and surprise the enemy. I shall, therefore, beg 
leave to observe, in regard to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, that if 
it is continued, we must be confined to act defensively, 
and keep our forces dispersed as they now are. The 
place must be fortified with strong works, or else it will 
inevitably fall, garrison and stores, into the enemy's 
hands. I enclose Colonel Stephen's letter on this head, 
in answer to one I wrote to him. 
</p><p>
I did, from the beginning, express my sentiments 
against having small garrisons in a chain of forts along 
our frontiers. We have a frontier of such immense extent, that to build forts at convenient distances would 
employ such numbers of men, and divide our troops 
into such trifling parties, that no one part could defend itself, much less the inhabitants, were the country invaded. 
</p><p>
The most effectual way that I can see, though none can answer while we act defensively, is to have no more 
than three or four large, strong forts, built at convenient 
distances, upon our frontiers ; in which strong garrisons 
must be maintained, that parties able to cope with the 
enemy may be sent out, and these parties kept in constant succession ranging and scouring the country. 
Here a difficulty will arise, as others will in every defensive plan, that can be offered. How are these ranging parties, sent out in this manner, and probably 
remaining on the scout from ten to fourteen days, to be 
supplied with provisions, the inhabitants being so thinly 
settled, and the forts so far extended? The difficulty 
is great, yet not sufficient to render this plan inferior to 
the former. For in the other case, when the enemy is 
heard of, the garrison can only send out parties, more fit 
to reconnoitre than oppose. These parties, if they 
prove too small (which in all probability they may), are 
certain of falling a prey to the enemy, whose numbers 
cannot be known until thus proved. I could urge many 
things more on this head, but believe it useless. What 
I have already said, I hope, is sufficient to give your 
Honor a hint of the matter, and that is all I aim at. We 
may form many schemes to defend ourselves, but experience will show, that none but removing the cause of the 
difficulties will prove effectual. Unless the Assembly 
concerts some measures to augment their force, the country, I fear, must inevitably fall. The frontiers, within 
twelve months, have been totally deserted for fifty miles 
and upwards from north to south, and all below that distance greatly thinned by the removal of numbers ; occasioned in some measure by Maryland and Pennsylvania 
giving ground so much faster than we do, which exposes 
a very fine country of ours on that side, as low as Monocosy in Maryland, several miles on this side of the Blue Ridge. 
</p><p>
I believe I might also add, that no person, who regards his character, will undertake a command without 
the means of preserving it ; since his conduct is culpable 
for all misfortunes, and never right but when successful. 
</p><p>
I cannot think any number under two thousand men 
sufficient to cover our extensive frontiers, and with that 
number it would be impossible to prevent misfortunes, 
however easy the world may think it. What means can 
be used to raise these men, I know not, unless the enlisting of servants is thought expedient; and that alone 
will prove ineffectual. Some determination should be 
had about the ranging companies. Under what regulations those are in Augusta, and what service they have 
done the country, I know not. Those in this quarter 
have done little, and both companies amount to about 
thirty men only at this time. I apprehend it will be 
thought advisable to keep a garrison always at Fort 
Loudoun ; for which reason I would beg leave to represent the number of tippling-houses in Winchester as a 
great nuisance to the soldiers, who, by this means, in 
despite of the utmost care and vigilance, are, so long as 
their pay holds out, incessantly drunk, and unfit for 
service. 
</p><p>
The rates of their liquor are immoderately high, and 
the publicans throughout the country charge one shilling 
a meal, currency, for soldier's diet; and the country 
only allows the recruiting officer eight pence a day for 
the maintenance of a soldier, by which means he loses 
in proportion as he obtains men, which is much complained of, and is in reality a discouraging circumstance 
demanding redress. The want of a chaplain, I humbly 
conceive, reflects dishonor on the regiment, as all other 
officers are allowed. The gentlemen of the corps are 
sensible of this, and proposed to support one at their 
private expense. But I think it w r ould have a more graceful appearance were he appointed as others are. 
I could wish some method were practised to bring the 
commonalty acquainted with the laws against entertaining deserters, and to enforce those laws. 
</p><p>
An officer of the American Regiment is recruiting at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and purposes to go through the country, 
and pass into Carolina. He has enlisted some servants, 
and intends to take all he can meet with. This, I believe, may evince the necessity of our following his 
example, otherwise we shall suffer our .colony to be 
weakened without receiving any immediate advantage ; 
though I imagine the expense will be nearly the same 
to the country, whether they are in the Bang's or country's service. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect, your Honor's, &c.
