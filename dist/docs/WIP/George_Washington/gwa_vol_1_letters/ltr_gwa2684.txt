TO JOHN BLAIR, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Hearing of the Governor's departure for England, I 
think it a duty incumbent on me to inform your Honor, 
that I lingered a long time under an illness, which 
obliged me to retire from my command, by the surgeon's advice, and with the Governor's approbation, and 
that I am yet but imperfectly recovered, which is the 
cause that detains me from my duty. 
</p><p>
I have many accounts to settle with the Committee, 
and should be glad to obtain leave to go down for that 
purpose, this being the proper season, as our frontiers 
are quiet. I also wish to receive money for contingent expenses, before I return to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, as there are 
several demands, on the public account, that I should be glad to be provided against. And further, I shall at that 
time have an opportunity of laying before you a state of 
the frontier settlements, a matter worthy of great attention, as the well-being of the people depends on seasonable and well concerted measures for their defence. 
</p><p>
If you have any orders for the troops under my command, please to favor me with them, and they shall be forwarded, before I go down myself for the purposes aforesaid. 
</p><p>
I am, with great esteem,
</p><p>
Your Honor's most obedient, humble servant 
</p>
