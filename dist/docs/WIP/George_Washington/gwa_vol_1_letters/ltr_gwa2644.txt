<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 2 February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I can but return my very hearty thanks for your kind 
condescension in suffering me to wait upon General 
Shirley, as I am very well assured it was done with the 
intention to favor my suit. 
</p><p>
There is as yet an unanswerable argument against our 
taking the field, which I forgot to mention in my last; 
that is, the want of a train of artillery, and, what is full 
as necessary, engineers to conduct the affair, if we hope 
to approach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
By the advices, which we have received hitherto from 
the northward, the Pennsylvanians are determined to 
act defensively. For that purpose they have posted 
their newly raised levies upon their frontiers at different 
passes, and have received the additional strength and 
favor of a detachment or two from the regulars. 
</p><p>
I have ordered, besides the forts that are built, and 
now building, that a road which I had reconnoitred, 
and which proves nearer and better, should be immediately opened for the more easy transportation of stores 
from Winchester to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> ; so there is not 
the least fear that the soldiers will be corrupted through idleness. 
</p><p>
The commission for calling general courts -martial appears to me imperfect, notwithstanding it was drawn by 
the attorney-general, as it rather, by the words, appoints 
me, or whomever it is directed to, president of the said 
court, than invests a power to hold a court-martial without its being first ordered by you ; whereas, the commission should empower the officer to appoint a court, 
of which he is to be president. But as I hope there 
will be little occasion for any, until I come back, it may 
be deferred until then, when that and other things, I 
trust, will be properly settled. 
</p><p>
I have always, so far as was in my power, endeavoured to discourage gaming in the camp ; and always 
shall while I have the honor to preside there. 
</p><p>
I have delivered the skipper to Mr. Carlyle, who proposes, in order to save expense, to send him round by 
water, in the vessel that brought up the stores. The 
evidences in this affair will be Mr. Carlyle, Ensigns 
Buckner and Deane, and one of the men now in the 
vessel. 
</p><p>
I cannot help observing, that your Honor, if you have 
not seen the clothes lately sent up, has been imposed 
upon by the contractors, for they are really unfit for use; 
or, at least, will soon be so. 
</p><p>
I have nothing in particular to add, but to assure you, 
that I shall use my utmost diligence in the prosecution 
of my journey and pretensions, and that I am, with very 
great esteem, your Honor's, &c.  . 
</p>
