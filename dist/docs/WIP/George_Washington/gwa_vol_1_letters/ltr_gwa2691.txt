<p>
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 24 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

Your letter of the 19th instant, intended to come by Colonel Stephen, was received to-day about noon by 
express. As it contains several matters of an interesting nature, I chose to be aided in my determinations by 
the advice of my officers, and I now enclose their and my opinions on the several heads. 
</p><p>
I could by no means think of executing, willingly, that discretionary power, with which you were pleased to 
invest me, of ordering out the militia, f It is an affair, Sir, of too important and delicate a nature for me to 
manage. Much discontent will be the inevitable consequence of this draft.

That was a most extraordinary request of Colonel Mercer's, concerning the exchange of officers, and calculated, it should seem, rather to breed confusion, 
than to benefit the other regiment. There is not an 
ensign there, that would not rather quit the service, than 
accept of a company in the other regiment, so much do 
they disapprove Colonel Mercer's proposal ; and I have 
neither inclination nor power to force their compliance. 
Captain Rutherford's company was raised and posted in 
this quarter by Governor Dinwiddie's express orders, 
and can be more useful here, than any other men whatever, being all sons of the neighbouring farmers, men of 
property, young, active, and acquainted with the woods 
on these frontiers. Whereas, if they go to the southward, they will be utter strangers to the enemy's haunts, 
and of no more use there, than the militia of an adjacent 
county; while their places here must be supplied by 
militia equally ignorant of these woods ; besides giving 
them a useless march of two hundred miles, and exposing the frontiers in the mean time. Another reason, 
which may be urged, is, that their property all lies in 
this county. Interested motives induced them to enlist, 
and to be vigilant in defending it, and, I believe, they 
would desert, rather than go to the southward. 
</p><p>
Your Honor will please to remember, that one of the 
last questions, which I had an opportunity of asking, 
was, whether I should send out recruiting parties. You 
replied, " that, since the Assembly was so near meeting, 
you would defer giving any directions on that head." 
As I had no money for the purpose, I hope it will not 
seem surprising, that we have recruited but few men 
since. I have been waiting for orders to complete the 
regiment. I shall now use my best endeavours, with 
the very few officers, who can be spared from the garrisons, dispersed as we are. I am, &c.
