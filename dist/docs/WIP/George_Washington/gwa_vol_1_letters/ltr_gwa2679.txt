TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a copy of a letter, which I received from Captain M c Kenzie. Since my last, the different parties 
I detached in quest of the enemy, who committed the 
late depredations in this neighbourhood, are returned, 
after having prosecuted the most feasible measures, and 
exerted their utmost efforts in vain, in endeavouring 
to come up with the enemy and prevent their escape. 
Nor is this in any degree surprising. When the vast 
extent of country, the scattered condition of the inhabitants, the nature of the ground, and the disposition of the 
enemy, are collectively considered, it is next to impossible, that any of our parties should ever see the enemy, 
except when they possess such advantages as render their victory certain. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of this valuable and very fertile valley 
are terrified beyond expression. Some have abandoned 
their plantations, and many are packing up their most 
valuable effects to follow them. Another irruption into 
the heart of this settlement will, I am afraid, be of fatal 
consequence. I was always persuaded, and almost 
every day affords new matter for confirming me in the 
opinion, that the enemy can, with the utmost facility, 
render abortive every plan, which can be concerted 
upon our present system of defence ; and that the only 
method of effectually defending such a vast extent of 
mountains covered with thick woods, like our frontiers, 
against such an enemy, is by carrying the war into their 
country. And I think I may, without assuming uncommon penetration, venture to affirm, that, unless an 
expedition is carried on against the Ohio next spring, 
this country will not be another year in our possession. 
</p><p>
Sickness, and the different parties, which the distressed situation of affairs here obliged me to detach 
from this garrison, so greatly retard the works, that the 
finishing of even the principal parts of them, before the 
winter sets in, will, I am afraid, prove impracticable. 
</p><p>
I understand there is a mortar and a number of shells at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, which would be of great service here. 
We have a quantity of round and grape-shot for sixpounders, but no cannon for using them. A few pieces 
of that size would be an essential addition to our 
strength; and, as this is the only place we have, at 
which, were it finished, a stand could be made, in case 
of any formidable attack, I conceive nothing in our 
power should be omitted to make it as defensible as we can. 
</p><p>
Mr. Rutherford is not yet returned. Enclosed is a 
list of the persons killed and captured by the enemy, 
when last down. I am, &c.
