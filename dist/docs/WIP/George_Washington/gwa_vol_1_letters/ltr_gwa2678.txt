DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 22d ultimo came to hand about four 
days ago. In answer to that part, which relates to 
Colonel C.'s gross and infamous reflections on my conduct last spring, it will be needless, I dare say, to observe further at this time, than that the liberty, which he 
has been pleased to allow himself in sporting with my 
character, is little else than a comic entertainment, discovering at one view his passionate fondness for your 
friend, his inviolable love of truth, his unfathomable 
knowledge, and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in 
displaying it. These several talents he has, I think, 
exhibited in a most conspicuous manner to every person, who was in the least degree acquainted with the 
situation of affairs in this county at that juncture. The 
report of your false musters is equally absurd. 
</p><p>
You are heartily welcome to make use of any letter, 
or letters, which I may at any time have written to you ; 
for, although I keep no copies of epistles to my friends, 
nor can remember the contents of all of them, yet, I am 
sensible, that the narrations are just, and that truth and 
honesty will appear in my writings ; of which, therefore, 
I shall not be ashamed, though criticism may censure 
my style. I am, &,c. 
</p>
