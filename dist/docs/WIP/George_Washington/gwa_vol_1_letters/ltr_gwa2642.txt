TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
When I was down, the Committee among other things 
resolved, that the Maryland and Carolina companies 
should not be supported with our provisions. This resolve, I think, met with your approbation ; upon which 
I wrote to Colonel Stephen, desiring him to acquaint 
Captain Dagworthy therewith, who paid slight regard to 
it, saying they were in the King's garrison, and all the 
troops had an equal right to draw provisions with us, by 
his order, as commanding officer, and that we, after the 
provisions were put there, had no power to remove 
them without his leave. I would, therefore, request 
your Honor's peremptory orders what to do in this case, 
as I do not care to act without instructions, lest it should 
appear to proceed from pique and resentment at having 
the command disputed. This is one among the numberless inconveniences of the fort being in Maryland. 
Captain Dagworthy, I dare venture to affirm, is encouraged to say this by Governor Sharpe, who we know 
has written him to keep the command. With this Captain Dagworthy himself acquainted Colonel Stephen. 
</p><p>
As I have not yet heard how General Shirley has 
answered your request, I fear for the success of it, especially as it is next to an impossibility (since Governor 
Sharpe has been there to plead Captain Dagworthy's 
cause) to make the General acquainted, by writing, with 
the nature of the dispute. The officers have drawn up a 
memorial to be presented to the General, and, that it 
may be properly strengthened, they humbly beg your 
solicitation to have us put upon the establishment, as we 
have certain advices that it is in his power. This would 
at once put an end to contention, which is the root 
of evil, and destructive to the best operations ; and it 
w r ould turn all our movements into a free and easy 
channel. 
</p><p>
They have urged it to me, in the warmest manner, 
to appear personally before the General for that end. 
This I would gladly do, even at this disagreeableseason, 
if I had your permission ; which I the more freely ask, 
since I am determined to resign a commission, which 
you were generously pleased to offer me, and for which 
I shall always retain a grateful sense, rather than submit 
to the command of a person, who has not such superlative merit as to balance the inequality of rank. However, he adheres to what he calls his rights, in which 
I know he is supported by Governor Sharpe. He says, 
that he has no commission from the province of Maryland, but acts by virtue of that from the King ; that this 
was the condition of his engaging in the Maryland service; and that, when he was sent up there the 1st of 
last October, he was ordered by Governor Sharpe and 
Sir John St. Clair not to give up his right. To my 
certain knowledge his rank was disputed before General 
Braddock, who gave it in his favor ; and he accordingly 
took place of every captain upon the expedition, except 
Captain James Mercer and Captain Rutherford, whose 
commissions were older than his ; so that I should not 
by any means choose to act, as your Honor hinted in 
your last, lest I should be called to an account myself.  
</p><p>
I have, during my stay at Winchester from the 20th 
of December to this time, disposed of all the men and 
officers, that are not recruiting, and can be spared from 
the fort, in the best manner I could for the defence of 
the inhabitants, and they will need no further orders till 
I could return. And the recruiting officers are allowed 
till the 1st of March to repair to their rendezvous, which 
leaves at present nothing to do at the fort, but to train 
and discipline the men, and prepare and salt the provisions. For the better perfecting both these, I have 
left full and clear directions. 
</p><p>
Besides, in other respects, I think my going to the 
northward might be of service, as I should thereby become acquainted with the plan of operations, so far as it 
may be thought proper to be communicated. 
</p><p>
Should you comply with my request, I would thank 
you for such letters, as you think may enforce the petition to the General, or any of the governors in my way. 
I am, &c. 
</p>
