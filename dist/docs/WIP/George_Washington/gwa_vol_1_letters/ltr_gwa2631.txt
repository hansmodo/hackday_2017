HONORED MADAM, 
</p><p>
If it is in my power to avoid going to the Ohio again, I shall ; but if the command is pressed upon me, by the 
general voice of the country, and offered upon such terms as cannot be objected against, it would reflect 
dishonor upon me to refuse it ; and that, I am sure, must or ought to give you greater uneasiness, than my going 
in an honorable command. Upon no other terms will I accept of it. At present I have no proposals made to 
me, nor have I any advice of such an intention, except from private hands. I am, &,c.
