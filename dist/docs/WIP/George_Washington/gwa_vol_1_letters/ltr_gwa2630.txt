</p><p>
DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
The pleasure of your company at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> 
always did, and always will, afford me infinite satisfaction ; but, at this time, I am too sensible how needful 
the country is of all the assistance of its members, to 
have a wish to hear that any are absent from the Assembly. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely wish, that unanimity may prevail in 
all your counsels, and that a happy issue may attend 
your deliberations at this important crisis. 
</p><p>
I am not able, were I ever so willing, to meet you in 
town, for, I assure you, it is with some difficulty, and 
much fatigue, that I visit my plantations ; so much has 
a sickness of five weeks' continuance reduced me. But 
though it is not in my power to meet you there, I can 
nevertheless assure you, and others "whom it may concern," (to borrow a phrase from Governor Innes,) that, 
so little am I dispirited at what has happened, I am always ready, and always willing, to render my country 
any services that I am capable of, but never upon the 
terms I have done ; having suffered much in my private 
fortune, besides impairing one of the best of constitutions. 
</p><p>
I was employed to go a journey in the winter, when, 
I believe, few or none would have undertaken it, and 
what did I get by it ? My expenses borne ! I then was 
appointed, with trifling pay, to conduct a handful of men 
to the Ohio. What did I get by that? Why, after 
putting myself to a considerable expense, in equipping 
and providing necessaries for the campaign, I went out, 
was soundly beaten, and lost them all ! came in, and 
had my commission taken from me, or, in other words, 
my command reduced, under pretence of an order from 
home ! I then went out a volunteer with General Braddock, and lost all my horses, and many other things. 
But this being a voluntary act, I ought not to have mentioned it ; nor should I have done it, were it not to show, 
that I have been upon the losing order ever since I entered the service, which is now nearly two years. So 
that I think I cannot be blamed, should I, if I leave my 
family again, endeavour to do it upon such terms, as to 
prevent my suffering ; to gain by it being the least of 
my expectations. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but you have heard the particulars of our 
shameful defeat, which really was so scandalous, that I 
hate to mention it. You desire to know what artillery 
was taken in the late engagement. It is easily told. 
We lost all that we carried out, excepting two sixpounders, and a few cohorns, which were left with 
Colonel Dunbar ; and the cohorns have since been destroyed to accelerate his flight. You also ask, whether 
I think the forces can march out again this fall. I answer, I think it impossible, at least, for them to do the 
French any damage (unless it be by starving them), for the want of a proper train of artillery ; yet they may be 
very serviceable in erecting small fortresses at convenient places to deposit provisions in, by which means 
the country will be eased of an immense expense in the 
carriage, and it will also be a means of securing a retreat, if we should be put to the rout again. The 
success of this measure, however, will depend greatly 
upon what Governor Shirley does at Niagara ; for, if he 
succeeds, their communication with Canada will be entirely cut off. 
</p><p>
It is impossible for me to guess at the number of 
recruits, that may be wanted, as that must depend altogether upon the strength of the French on the Ohio, 
which, to my great astonishment, we were always 
strangers to. 
</p><p>
I thank you, very heartily, for your kind offer of a 
chair, and for your goodness in sending my things ; and, 
after begging you to excuse the imperfections of this 
letter, which, in part, are owing to my having much 
company that hurries me, I shall conclude, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate brother. 
</p>
