<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 27 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I sent an express to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> on Tuesday 
last, who is just returned with the enclosed letters, 
which I forward, to prevent the trouble of extracting a 
part. 
</p><p>
In my letter to Colonel Stephen, I informed him, 
among other things, of the accusations laid to his charge, 
and that he must expect to have, the matter inquired 
into. You will see what he says upon the subject. 
</p><p>
Desolation and murder still increase, and no prospects 
of relief. The Blue Ridge is now our frontier, no men 
being left in this county, except a few that keep close 
with a number of women and children in forts, which 
they have erected for that purpose. There are now no 
militia in this county. When there were, they could 
not be brought to action. If the inhabitants of the adjacent counties pursue the same system of disobedience, 
the whole must fall an inevitable sacrifice ; and there is 
room to fear, that they have caught the infection, as I 
have sent, besides divers letters to Lord Fairfax, express after express to hurry them on, and yet I have no 
tidings of their march. We have the greatest reason to 
believe, that the number of the enemy is very considerable, as they are spread all over this part of the country ; 
and that their success, and the spoils with which they have enriched themselves, dished up with a good deal 
of French policy, will encourage the Indians of distant 
nations to fall upon our inhabitants in greater numbers, 
and, if possible, with greater rapidity. They enjoy the 
sweets of a profitable war, and will no doubt improve 
the success, which must ever attend their arms, unless 
we have Indians to oppose theirs. I would therefore 
advise, as I often have done, that there should be neither 
trouble nor expense omitted to bring the few, who are 
still inclined, into our service, and that, too, with the 
greatest care and expedition. A small number, just to 
point out the wiles and tracks of the enemy, is better 
than none ; for which reason I must earnestly recommend, that those, who accompanied Major Lewis, 
should be immediately sent up, and such of the Catawbas as can be engaged in our interest. If such another 
torrent as this has been, (or may be ere it is done,) 
should press upon our settlements, there will not be a 
living creature left in Frederic county ; and how soon 
Fairfax and Prince William may share its fate is easily 
conceived, if we only consider a cruel and bloodthirsty 
enemy, conquerors already possessed of the finest part 
of Virginia, plenteously filled with all kinds of provisions, pursuing a people overcome with fear and consternation at the inhuman murders of these barbarous 
savages. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants, who are now in forts, are greatly distressed for the want of ammunition and provision, and 
are incessantly importuning me for both; neither of 
which have I at this place to spare. And if I had, I 
should be much embarrassed to know how to act, as I 
could not be safe in delivering them without your orders ; but to hear the cries of the hungry, who have fled 
for refuge to these places, with nothing more than they 
carried on their backs, is exceedingly moving. I hope, therefore, that you will give directions concerning this matter. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Assembly, setting forth the 
great necessity of erecting a large and strong fort at this 
place, to serve as a receptacle for all our stores, and a 
place of refuge for the women and children in times of 
danger. Were this work completed, the men would 
upon any alarm, as they say themselves, immediately 
lodge their families here, and turn out against the enemy. 
But without some such place of defence, they must 
always fly in the manner they have done, in order to 
secure their wives and children. 
</p><p>
This is the place generally fixed upon, as it has a free 
and open communication with all the country, from its 
peculiar situation. It also secures the communication 
with the neighbouring colonies, and is conveniently situated for procuring intelligence. This is now fully proved 
by the experience I have had since I came here. From 
the time the first murders were committed by the Indians, I have never missed of receiving intelligence of 
their motions, while Colonel Stephen has, in a manner, 
lived in total ignorance. The reason is obvious. Fort 
Cumberland is detached so far beyond the inhabitants, 
that no person thinks of alarming it, but immediately, 
upon the first fright, they retire within the settlements. 
</p><p>
You will observe some parts of Colonel Stephen's letters, about reinforcements from the second division, and 
the number of men, which were only meant as a finesse, 
in case they should fall into the enemy's hands. The 
letters, conveying the true accounts, were put into the 
pummel of the saddle, as were mine to him. 
</p><p>
I have been formerly, and am at present, pretty full 
in offering my opinion and counsel upon matters, which 
regard the public safety and interest. These have been 
solely the object of all my thoughts, words, and actions ; 
and, in order to avoid censure in every part of my conduct, I make it a rule to obey the dictates of your Honor, 
the Assembly, and a good conscience. 
</p><p>
I shall not hereafter trouble you further on these topics, as I can add nothing to what I have said. 
</p><p>
I am your Honor's, &,c. 
</p>
