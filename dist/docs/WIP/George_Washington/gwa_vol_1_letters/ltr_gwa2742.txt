REVEREND SIR, 
</p><p>
The favorable account, which you were pleased to 
transmit to me, of Mr. Custis's conduct at college, gave 
me very great satisfaction. I hoped to have felt an increase of it by his continuance at that place, under a 
gentleman so capable of instructing him in every branch 
of useful knowledge. But this hope is at an end ; and 
it has been against my wishes, that he should quit college, in order that he may enter soon into a new scene 
of life, which I think he would be much fitter for some 
years hence, than now.  But having his own inclination, the desires of his mother, and the acquiescence of 
almost all his relatives to encounter, I did not care, as 
he is the last of the family, to push my opposition too 
far, and I have therefore submitted to a kind of necessity. 
</p><p>
Not knowing how his expenses at college may stand, 
I shall be much obliged to you if you will render me an 
account of them. You will please to charge liberally 
for your own particular attention to Mr. Custis, and 
sufficiently reward the other gentlemen, who were engaged in the same good offices. If the money I left 
with you is insufficient to answer these purposes, please 
to advise me thereof, and I will remit the deficiency. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry it was not in my power to see you 
whilst in these parts. I thank you very sincerely, Sir, 
for your polite regard to Mr. Custis, during his abode at 
college, and through you beg leave to offer my acknowledgments in like manner to the professors. With 
very great esteem and regard, Reverend Sir, 
</p><p>
I am, your most obedient humble servant.
