SIR, 
</p><p>
The enclosed is the clergyman's certificate of my 
marriage with Mrs. Martha Custis, properly, as I am 
told, authenticated. You will, therefore, for the future 
please to address all your letters, which relate to the 
affairs of the late Daniel Parke Custis, to me, as by marriage I am entitled to a third part of that estate, and am 
invested likewise with the care of the other two thirds 
by a decree of our General Court, which I obtained in 
order to strengthen the power I before had in consequence of my wife's administration. 
</p><p>
I have many letters of yours in my possession unanswered ; but at present this serves only to advise you of 
the above change, and at the same time to acquaint you, 
that I shall continue to make you the same consignments of tobacco as usual, and will endeavour to increase 
them in proportion as I find myself and the estate benefited thereby. 
</p><p>
The scarcity of the last year's crop, and the consequent high prices of tobacco, would, in any other case, have induced me to sell the estate's crop in this country; but, for a present, and I hope small advantage only, 
I did not care to break the chain of correspondence, that has so long subsisted. 
</p><p>
On the other side is an invoice of some goods, which 
I beg you to send me by the first ship, bound either to the Potomac or Rappahannoc, as I am in immediate 
want of them. Let them be insured, and, in case of 
accident, re-shipped without delay. Direct for me at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, Potomac River, Virginia ; the former is 
the name of my seat, the other of the river on which it 
is situated. I am, &c. 
</p>
