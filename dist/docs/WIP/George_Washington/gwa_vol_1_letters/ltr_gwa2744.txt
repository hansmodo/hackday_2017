TO HENRY RIDDELL.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 22 February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Young, hearing me express a desire of importing 
Palatines to settle on my lands on the Ohio, tells me, 
that, in discoursing of this matter in your company, you 
suggested an expedient, which might probably be attended with success ; and that if I inclined to adopt it, 
you wished to be informed before the sailing of your 
ship. 
</p><p>
The desire of seating and improving my lands on the 
Ohio, is founded on interested as well as political views. 
But the intention of importing Palatines for the purpose was more the effect of sudden thought, than mature 
consideration, because I am totally unacquainted with 
the manner, as well as the expense of doing it ; and I 
was led into the notion principally from a report of either 
this or some other ship of yours being blamed, for riot 
taking an offered freight of these Germans at forty shillings sterling. I was thus induced to think if this charge 
was not much accumulated by other expenses, that I 
could fall on no better expedient to settle my lands with 
industrious people, than by such an importation. 
</p><p>
The terms upon which I have thought of importing 
Palatines, or people from Ireland, or Scotland, are these ; 
to import them at my expense, where they are unable to transport themselves, into the Potomac River, 
and from hence to the Ohio ; to have them, in the first 
case, engaged to me under indenture ; in the second, by 
some other contract equally valid, to become tenants 
upon the terms hereafter mentioned ; as without these 
securities, I would not encounter the expense, trouble, 
and hazard of such an importation. 
</p><p>
But to make matters as easy and agreeable as possible to these emigrants, I will engage, on my part, that 
the indentures shall be considered in no other light, than 
as a security for reimbursing to me every expense I am 
under, with interest, in importing them, removing them 
to the land, and supporting them there, till they can raise 
a crop for their own subsistence ; giving up the said 
indentures, and considering them altogether as freemen 
and tenants, so soon as this shall happen ; not to each 
person or family respectively, but when the whole accumulated expense shall be discharged ; as I must, for my 
own safety, consider them as jointly bound for this payment, till the expiration of the indented terms, otherwise 
T must be an inevitable loser by every death or other 
accident ; whilst they cannot, in the worst light, be considered as more than servants at large during the indented term. I can also engage to set them down upon 
as good land as any in that country ; and, where there 
is neither house built, nor land cleared, I will allow them 
an exemption of rent four years ; and, where there is a 
house erected, and five acres of land cleared and fit for 
cultivation, two years. 
</p><p>
They shall have the land upon lease for twenty-one 
years, under the usual covenants ; and also at an annual 
rent, after the first becomes due, of four pounds sterling for each hundred acres, allowing each family to take 
more or less, as inclination and convenience may prompt. 
And I will, moreover, engage to renew the leases at the 
expiration of the above tw r enty-one years ; and, in like 
manner, at the end of every seven years afterwards, upon 
an increased rent, to be agreed on between the landlord 
and tenant ; or, in order to fix the matter absolutely, if 
this should be more agreeable, the rent may be increased 
at these periods in proportion to the increased value of 
that, or the adjoining lands possessed of equal advantages of soil and situation. 
</p><p>
These are the terms on which I thought to import 
and plant people on my Ohio lands, which are, for the 
quantity, equal if not superior to any in that country ; 
situate altogether upon the Ohio, or Great Kenhawa, 
two fine inland navigable rivers, abounding in fish and 
wild fowl of all sorts, as the lands do in wild meats of 
the best kind. 
</p><p>
From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> to the navigable waters of the Ohio, 
along a much frequented road used by wagons, is, according to the computed distance, two hundred miles. 
This land -carriage, if the inland navigation of the Potomac should be effected, than which I think nothing easier, will be reduced to sixty miles as matters now 
stand ; some say to forty, and others to twenty. But, call it the greatest distance, any commodity made upon 
any part of these lands of mine may be transported 
along a very easy water-communication to the settlement of Red-stone, where the land-carriage at this time 
begins. To say nothing, therefore, of the advantages 
of raising stock of all kinds, and horses, which will carry 
themselves to market, and are now and will, from the 
nature of things, continue to be in great demand in the 
interior parts of this great continent, hemp, flax, potashes, indigo, and the like, will well afford the expense 
of this land-carriage, admitting it never may be reduced, 
and can be cultivated to advantage on the river bottoms 
in that country. 
</p><p>
Having thus exhibited a general view of my design, 
I shall now be obliged to you, Sir, to inform me with 
as much precision as you can, what certainty there is 
that your ship will go to Holland; what probability 
there is of her getting Palatines, if she does go ; when 
they may be expected in this country; what would 
be the freight; and, as near as you can judge, the 
whole incidental expense attending each person delivered at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> ; and, moreover, whether it 
would be expected, that the whole of these charges, 
including freight, should be paid down immediately on 
the arrival of the ship here, as it must appear rather 
hard to make a certain provision for an uncertain event. 
It may not be amiss further to observe, that I see no 
prospect of these people being restrained in the smallest 
degree, either in their civil or religious principles ; which 
I take notice of, because these are privileges, which 
mankind are solicitous to enjoy, and upon which emigrants must be anxious to be informed. 
</p><p>
I wrote to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> by the last post for full information of the manner and charge of importing these 
people from Holland ; and, if your account in answer to this letter should prove agreeable to my wishes, I will 
send a more particular description of the lands, which I 
wish to settle, as well as copies of the plots, and do any 
other matter which may be judged necessary to further 
the design. I am, &,c. 
</p>
