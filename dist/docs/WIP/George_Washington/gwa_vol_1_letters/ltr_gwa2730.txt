DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Having once or twice of late heard you speak highly 
of the New Jersey College, as if you had a desire of 
sending your son William there (who, I am told, is a 
youth fond of study and instruction, and disposed to a 
studious life, in following which he may not only promote his own happiness, but the future welfare of others), 
I should be glad, if you have no other objection to it 
than the expense, if you would send him to that college, 
as soon as convenient, and depend on me for twentyfive pounds a year for his support, so long as it may be 
necessary for the completion of his education. If I live 
to see the accomplishment of this term, the sum here 
stipulated shall be annually paid ; and if I die in the 
mean time, this letter shall be obligatory upon my heirs, 
or executors, to do it according to the true intent and 
meaning hereof. 
</p><p>
No other return is expected, or wished, for this offer, 
than that you will accept it with the same freedom and 
good will, with which it is made, and that you may not 
even consider it in the light of an obligation, or mention 
it as such ; for, be assured, that from me it will never 
be known. I am, &,c. 
</p>
