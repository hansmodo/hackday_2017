<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
Without date. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
As I wrote so lately and fully to you, by Mr. Poison, 
on the subject of the orders I had received, I have little 
to add now, only to acquaint your Honor, that as far as 
it is in my power, I shall endeavour to comply with 
them. What men we can, we do enlist ; but to send 
officers into different parts for that purpose, would be 
unavailing, as they neither have money, nor can get any. 
I have given Major Carlyle memorandums of several 
questions to ask your Honor, to which I beg your answers, that I may be governed thereby. I have also sent 
some of the soldiers' accounts, in hope of getting the 
money for them, as they are uneasy on that head. 
Others of them are rendered useless by their late wounds ; therefore I hope you will recommend it to the 
consideration of the Assembly, that some provision may 
be made to keep them from want. 
</p><p>
I have also desired Major Carlyle to mention to you 
the great necessity there is for regulation in the soldiers' 
pay ; and that a certain part may be deducted and appropriated for clothing. Unless this be done, we shall 
ever be in the distressed condition we are in at present, 
concerning which Major Carlyle can fully inform you. 
I refer you to him for many particulars, especially the 
consequences of going as high as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, if we 
cannot march farther ; as, for the reasons which have 
been alleged, I fear we cannot, if we attempt it ; and, at 
that place, for want of proper conveniences, we could 
not remain. I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
