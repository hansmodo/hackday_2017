<p>
TO MAJOR ANDREW LEWIS. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, 6 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>.
</p><p>
The country has come to a resolution to raise sixteen companies, which are to be formed into a regiment, 
and of which they have honored me with the command. 
I am allowed the liberty of appointing my field officers ; 
in consequence of which, I have ' commissioned you as 
major, and must desire you will, as soon as Captain 
Hogg arrives, and takes the command of your company, 
repair to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> with all imaginable despatch, 
to take charge of the recruits, that shall be brought to 
that place of rendezvous. I know your diligence and 
punctuality require little or no spur ; yet, as this is an 
affair that calls for the greatest despatch, I must earnestly recommend it to you. Be careful in getting a 
proper return of your company, that I may order things accordingly. 
</p><p>
A return must also be delivered to Captain Hogg, not 
only of the men, but of the arms, tools, &LC., and his receipt taken. I am, &LC. 
</p>
