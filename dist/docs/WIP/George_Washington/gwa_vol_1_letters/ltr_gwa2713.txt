<p>
TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, 2 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The enclosed was written with the intention of sending it by the General's express, but his indisposition 
prevented that express from setting out for three days 
afterwards ; and the General thought, that my waiting 
upon your Honor would be more eligible, as I could represent the situation of our affairs in this quarter more 
fully, than could well be done by letter. This I accordingly attempted ; but, upon trial, I found it impracticable 
to proceed with despatch, for want of horses, having 
now nearly two hundred miles to march before I can 
get a supply, and those at present in use being entirely 
disabled. I shall, notwithstanding, endeavour to comply 
with the General's request, but I cannot possibly be 
down till towards the 1st of next month^ and the bearer 
may arrive much sooner. 
</p><p>
The General has, in his letters, told you what garrison he proposed to leave at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, but the 
want of provisions rendered it impossible to leave more 
than two hundred men in all ; and these, without great 
exertions, must, I fear, abandon the place or perish. 
To prevent, as far as possible, either of these events, I 
have by this conveyance written a circular letter to the 
back inhabitants of Virginia, setting forth the great advantages of keeping that place, the improbability of doing it without their immediate assistance, that they may 
travel safely out while we hold that post, and that they 
will be allowed good prices for such provisions as they 
may carry. Unless the most effectual means shall be 
taken early in the spring to reinforce the garrison, the 
place will inevitably be lost, and then our frontiers will fall 
into the same distressed condition as heretofore. I can very confidently assert, that we never can secure them 
properly, if we again lose our footing on the Ohio, since 
we shall thereby lose the interest of the Indians. I therefore think, that every necessary preparation should be 
made, and not a moment lost in adopting the most 
speedy and efficacious measures, for securing the advantages to be derived from our holding possession of 
that important country. 
</p><p>
The preparatory steps should immediately be taken 
for preserving the communication from Virginia, by constructing a post at Red-stone Creek, which w r ould 
greatly facilitate the supplying of our troops on the Ohio, 
where a formidable garrison should be sent, as soon as 
the season will admit. A trade with the Indians should 
be established upon such terms, and transacted by men 
of such principle, as would at the same time redound to 
the reciprocal advantage of the colony and the Indians, 
and effectually remove the bad impressions, which the Indians have received from the conduct of a set of villains, 
divested of all faith and honor, and give us such an early 
opportunity of establishing an interest with them, as 
would ensure to us a large share of the fur-trade, not 
only of the Ohio Indians, but, in time, of the numerous 
nations possessing the back country westward. To 
prevent this advantageous commerce from suffering in 
its infancy, by the sinister views of designing, selfish 
men in the different provinces, I humbly conceive it advisable, that commissioners from each of the colonies 
should be appointed to regulate the mode of that trade, 
and fix it on such a basis, that all the attempts of one 
colony to undermine another, and thereby weaken and 
diminish the general system, might be frustrated. 
</p><p>
Although no one can entertain a higher sense of the 
great importance of maintaining a post on the Ohio than 
myself, yet, considering the present circumstances of my regiment, I would by no means have agreed to leave 
any part of it there, had not the General given an express order. I endeavoured to show, that the King's 
troops ought to garrison it ; but he told me, that, as he 
had no instructions from the ministry relative to this 
point, he could not order it. Our men, left there, are in 
such a miserable condition, having hardly rags to cover 
their nakedness, and exposed to the inclemency of the 
weather in this rigorous season, that, unless provision is 
made by the country for supplying them immediately, 
they must perish. If the first Virginia regiment is to be 
kept up any longer, or any services are expected from 
it, the men should forthwith be clothed. By their present nakedness, the advanced season, and the inconceivable fatigues of an uncommonly long and laborious 
campaign, they are rendered totally incapable of any 
kind of service ; and sickness, death, and desertion 
must, if they are not speedily supplied, greatly reduce 
their numbers. To replace them with equally good 
men will, perhaps, be found impossible. 
</p><p>
With the highest respect, I am, &,c.
