DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with an opportunity by Mr. Livingston, 
to acknowledge the receipt of your agreeable favor of 
the 19th ultimo; and to inform you of a very extraordinary affair, which has happened at this place, namely, 
the desertion of our quartermaster. This infamous fellow, as he has proved himself, after having disposed, in 
a clandestine manner, of many of our regimental stores, 
being called upon to settle his accounts (not that I, or 
any officer in the regiment, had the least suspicion of 
the roguery he was carrying on), pretended, that he 
could not come to an exact settlement without going to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, where some of the stores yet lay. Several 
of our soldiers deserting at the same time, he was sent 
in pursuit of them, which afforded him the desired opportunity of making his escape. His villany was not 
laid open, before his departure, and was at last accidentally discovered. This person had been several years a 
sergeant in one of his Majesty's regiments, and in this 
character he served three years under me. During 
that time he gave such signal proofs of his bravery and 
good behaviour, as bound me, in honor and gratitude, to 
do something for him. And I therefore got him promoted to be quartermaster, as he was acquainted with 
the duty, and capable, I thought, of discharging it. 
</p><p>
We have had several visitations from the enemy, and 
much mischief done, since my last to you. About the 
1 7th ultimo upwards of twenty persons were killed only 
twelve miles from this garrison, and, notwithstanding I 
sent a strong detachment hence to pursue them, and 
ordered the passes of the mountains to be waylaid by 
forces from other places, yet we were not able to meet 
with these savages. 
</p><p>
On Friday sevennight, a body of near or quite a hun 
dred fell upon the inhabitants along the great road between this place and Pennsylvania, and killed or took 
fifteen more. The mischief would have been much 
greater, had not an officer and twenty men of the regiment, who were then out, fallen in with and engaged the enemy. Finding, however, that his party was overpowered, and likely to be surrounded, he retreated to a 
stockade, not far distant, in which they were besieged 
for three hours ; but the firing communicated an alarm 
from one habitation to another, by which means most of 
the families were timely apprised of their danger, and 
happily escaped. Our party killed one Indian, whose 
scalp they obtained, and wounded several others. 
</p><p>
I exert every means in my power to protect a much 
distressed country, but it is a task too arduous. To 
think of defending a frontier of more than three hundred 
and fifty miles' extent, with only seven hundred men, is 
vain and idle, especially when that frontier lies more 
contiguous to the enemy than any other. I am, and 
have for a long time been, fully convinced, that, if we 
continue to pursue a defensive plan, the country must 
be inevitably lost. 
</p><p>
You will be kind enough, Sir, to excuse the freedom 
with which I deliver my sentiments, and believe me to 
be, as I really am, with unfeigned truth and regard, 
Your most obedient, humble servant. 
</p>
