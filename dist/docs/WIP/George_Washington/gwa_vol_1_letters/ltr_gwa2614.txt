<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 10 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
Yours I received by the post, and return you my 
hearty thanks for your kind congratulation on our late 
success, which I hope to improve without risking the 
imputation of rashness, or hazarding what a prudent 
conduct would forbid. I rejoice that I am likely to be 
happy under the command of an experienced officer, 
and man of sense. It is what I have ardently wished for.  I shall here beg leave to return my grateful thanks 
for your favor in promoting me to the command of the 
regiment. Believe me, Sir, when I assure you, that my 
breast is warmed with every generous sentiment, which 
your goodness can inspire. I want nothing but opportunity to testify my sincere regard for your person, to 
whom I stand indebted for so many unmerited favors. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may depend, I shall myself, and will 
endeavour to make my officers, show Captain Mackay 
all the respect due to his rank and merit ; but I should 
have been particularly obliged, if you had declared 
whether he was under my command, or independent of 
it.f However, I shall be studious to avoid all disputes 
that may tend to the public prejudice, but, as far as I 
am able, will inculcate harmony and unanimity. I hope 
Captain Mackay will have more sense, than to insist 
upon any unreasonable distinction because he and his 
officers have commissions from his Majesty. Let him 
consider, though we are greatly inferior in respect to 
advantages of profit, yet we have the same spirit to 
serve our gracious King as they have, and are as ready and willing to sacrifice our lives for our country's good. 
And here, once more, and for the last time, I must say, 
'that it will be a circumstance, which will act upon some 
officers of this regiment beyond all measure, to be 
obliged to serve upon such different terms, when their 
lives, their fortunes, and their operations are equally, and, 
I dare say, as effectually exposed, as those of others, 
who are happy enough to have King's commissions. 
</p><p>
I have been solicitous on this head, and have earnestly 
endeavoured to reconcile the officers to their appointments, and flatter myself that I have succeeded, having 
heard no mention thereof lately. I considered the pernicious consequences, that would attend a disunion, and 
was therefore too much attached to my country's interests to suffer it to ripen, after I received your letters. 
</p><p>
I am very thankful to you for ordering an assortment of Indian goods, which we daily find still more 
necessary. I shall take care, while they are under my 
direction, that they are judiciously applied, and shall 
be particularly careful in consulting Mr. Croghan and 
Mr. Montour, by whom I shall be advised in all Indian 
affairs agreeably to your directions.
</p><p>
I shall with great pleasure wear the medal, which you 
were pleased to compliment me with, and shall present 
the others to Indian chiefs, as I have already done one 
to the Half-King. 
</p><p>
We have been extremely ill used by Major Carlyle's 
deputies, which I am heartily sorry for, since he is a 
gentleman so capable of the business himself, and has 
taken so much pains to give satisfaction. He, I believe, 
has been deceived, and we have suffered by those under him, and by those who have contracted for provisions. We have been six days without flour, and 
there is none upon the road for our relief that we know 
of, though I have by repeated expresses given him timely 
notice. We have not provisions of any sort enough in 
camp to serve us two days. Once before we should 
have been four days without provisions, if Providence 
had not sent a trader from the Ohio to our relief, for 
whose flour I was obliged to give twenty-one shillings 
and eight pence per hundred. 
</p><p>
In a late letter to Major Carlyle, I have complained 
of the tardiness of his deputies. I likewise desired, that 
suitable stores of ammunition might be sent up speedily, 
for till that is done we have it not in our power to 
attempt any advantageous enterprise ; but must wait its 
arrival at Red-stone, for which I shall set off the moment 
provisions arrive to sustain us on the march. Major 
Carlyle mentioned a contract he had made with Mr. 
Croghan for flour, likewise Mr. Croghan's offer of furnishing more if required. I have therefore desired to 
have all that Mr. Croghan can furnish. 
</p><p>
Major Muse, with Captain Montour, joined us yesterday, and brought the wampum you sent to the HalfKing, which I presented, with the medal and speech. 
He is very thankful for the notice you have taken of 
him. Major Muse brought nine of the swivels, with 
some powder and balls ; and this day I have engaged 
fifty or sixty horses to bring up more of the balls and 
other stores from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, if there should be no 
provisions to load them with. The balls are to be 
brought in leather bags made for the purpose. I hear 
that Captain Mackay, who was to have brought the 
artillery, has marched without it, as wagons could not 
be procured. I shall write to Mr. Gist to procure wagons, if he is obliged to go to Pennsylvania for them, to 
bring out the artillery, if not, when Colonel Innes comes 
up we shall have nothing in readiness, and shall let slip 
this best season for action. 
</p><p>
The Indians are drawing off from the River daily, one 
of whom last night brought news of Monacawacha. He 
went from Logstown about five nights ago with the 
French scalps, and four hatchets, with which he intended 
to visit the four tribes of Indians between this and Lake 
Erie, and present to each tribe a scalp and hatchet, and 
at the same time acquaint them that it was expected, 
as the English and Six Nations had hand-in-hand 
struck the French, they would join our forces. This 
messenger likewise says, that Monacawacha was determined not only to counsel with the chiefs of those tribes, 
but with their great warriors also, which is customary in 
these cases, and was to return as soon as possible, 
which he imagined would be in fifteen days; but in 
case he should not return in that time, he left orders 
for the Indians at Logstown to set off for Red-stone 
Creek, so that they would all meet at Red-stone to join 
their brothers the English. He also desired there might 
be no attack made against the French fort, till he should 
return, by which time he hoped all the forces would be 
gathered, and then they would make a general attack 
together, and gain a complete victory at once. 
</p><p>
The Half-King has sent messengers to other places 
for warriors, who are to meet us also at Red-stone 
Creek. Besides these, he has sent two messengers, 
by the advice of Mr. Croghan, Mr. Montour, and myself, 
one to invite the Shawanees to come and receive one 
of their men, who was imprisoned in Carolina, and to 
counsel with us, and the other to the Delawares for the 
same purpose, as we hear both these nations have 
accepted the hatchet against us. This report was first 
brought by an Indian sent from Logstown to the HalfKing, and since confirmed by nine French deserters, 
who arrived at our camp to-day. These men farther 
say, that the fort at the Fork is completed, and proof 
against any attempts, but with bombs, on the land side. 
There were not above five hundred men in it, when 
they left it, but they suppose by this time two hundred 
more are arrived. Nine hundred were ordered to follow them, who might be expected in fourteen or fifteen 
days. 
</p><p>
I was as much disappointed when I met these persons 
to-day, as ever I was in my life. By misunderstanding 
the scouts that brought me intelligence, that is, mistaking ninety for nine, I marched out at the head of one 
hundred and thirty men (the major part of the effective 
men in the regiment), full with the hope of procuring 
another present of French prisoners for your Honor. 
Judge then my disappointment at meeting nine only, 
and those coming for protection. I guarded against all 
casualties, that might happen to the camp, and ordered 
Major Muse to repair into the fort, and erect the small 
swivels for the defence of the place, which he could do 
in an hour's time. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your desire I shall here mention the 
names of the gentlemen, who are to be promoted. 
Lieutenant George Mercer will worthily succeed to a 
captaincy. Captain Vanbraam has acted as captain 
ever since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>. He is an experienced, 
good officer, and very worthy of the command he has 
enjoyed. Mr. James Towers is the oldest ensign, for 
whom you will please to send a lieutenancy. To Captain Stephen I have already given a major's commission, 
finding one blank among Colonel Fry's papers. If 
merit, Sir, will entitle a gentleman to your notice, 
Mr. Peyrouny may justly claim a share of your favor. 
His conduct has been governed by the most consummate prudence, and all his actions have sufficiently 
testified his readiness to serve his country, which I 
really believe he looks upon Virginia to be. He was 
sensibly chagrined, when I acquainted him with your 
pleasure, of giving him an ensigncy. This he had twelve 
years ago, and long since commanded a company. 
He was prevailed on by Colonel Fry, when he left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, to accept the former commission, and assist 
my detachment, as I had very few officers, till we all 
met on the Ohio, which commission he would now have 
resigned, and returned to Virginia, but for my great 
dissuasion to the contrary. I have promised to solicit 
your Honor to appoint him adjutant, and continue him 
ensign, which will induce a very good officer to remain 
in the regiment. The office of adjutant, Sir, is most 
necessary to a regiment, in distributing the daily orders, 
receiving all reports, and seeing orders executed. In 
short, an adjutant is an indispensable officer. Should 
you be pleased to indulge me in this request, I shall 
look upon it in a very particular light, as I think the 
personal merit of the gentleman, his knowledge of military duty, and his activity will render him highly worthy 
of the favor. An ensign is still wanting, whom I hope 
you will send, if you know of any one suitable for the 
office. A young man in the camp, who came with 
Captain Lewis, has solicited, but I am yet ignorant of 
his character and qualities. He is a volunteer, and 
recommended by Captain Lewis. 
</p><p>
In a letter by Mr. Ward, you acquainted me, that 
you had given orders to Colonel Fry to examine into 
the proceedings of Captain Trent, and his lieutenant, 
Frazier, by a court-martial. I shall be glad if you will 
repeat your orders and instructions to me, or rather 
to Colonel Innes ; for an officer cannot be tried by those 
of his own regiment only, but has a right to be heard in a general court-martial. Captain Trent's behaviour 
has been very tardy, and has convinced the world of 
what they before suspected, his great timidity. Lieutenant Frazier, though not altogether blameless, is much 
more excusable, for he would not accept of the commission, till he had a promise from his captain, that he 
should not reside at the fort, nor visit it above once a week, or as he saw necessary. 
</p><p>
Queen Aliquippa desired that her son, who is really 
a great warrior, might be taken into council, as he was 
declining and unfit for business, and that he should 
have an English name given him. I therefore called 
the Indians together by the advice of the Half-King, 
presented one of the medals, and desired him to wear 
it in remembrance of his great father, the King of England, and called him by the name of Colonel Fairfax, 
which he was told signified the first of the council. This 
gave him great pleasure. I was also informed, that an 
English name would please the Half-King, which made 
me presume to give him that of your Honor, and call him 
Dinwiddie ; interpreted in their language, the head of 
all. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. These deserters corroborate what the others 
said and we suspected. La Force's party were sent out as spies, and were to show that summons if discovered, or overpowered, by a superior party of ours. 
They say the commander was blamed for sending so small a party. 
</p><p>
Since writing the foregoing, Captain Mackay, with 
the Independent Company, has arrived, whom I take 
to be a very good sort of a gentleman. For want of 
proper instructions from your Honor, I am much at a 
loss to know how to act, or proceed in regard to his 
company. I made it my particular study to receive 
him (as it was your desire) with all the respect and 
politeness, that were due to his rank, or that I was 
capable of showing ; and I do not doubt from his appearance and behaviour, that a strict intimacy will ensue, 
when matters shall be put in a clear light. But at present, 
I assure you, they will rather impede the service, than 
forward it ; for, as they have commissions from the King, 
they look upon themselves as a distinct body, and will 
not incorporate and do duty with our men, but keep 
separate guards, and encamp separately. I have not 
offered to control Captain Mackay in any thing, nor 
showed that I claimed a superior command, except in 
giving the patrole and countersign, which must be the 
same in an army consisting of different nations, to distinguish friends from foes. He knows the necessity of 
this, yet does not think he is to receive it from me. 
Then who is to give it '] Am I to issue these orders to 
a company 1 Or is an independent captain to prescribe 
rules to the Virginia regiment ? This is the question. 
But its absurdity is obvious. 
</p><p>
It now behoves you, Sir, to lay your absolute commands on one or the other to obey. This is indispensably necessary, for nothing clashes more with reason, 
than to conceive our small bodies can act distinctly, 
without having connexion with one another, and yet be 
serviceable to the public. I do not doubt that Captain 
Mackay is an officer of sense, and I dare say will do the 
best for the service ; but, Sir, two commanders are so 
incompatible, that we cannot be as useful to one another, 
or the public, as we ought ; and I am sincerely sorry, 
that he has arrived before your instructions by Colonel 
Innes, who I doubt not will be fully authorized how to 
act. But as we have no news of Colonel Innes, I have, 
in the mean time, desired Major Carlyle to send this by 
an immediate express to you, who, I hope, will satisfy 
these doubts. 
</p><p>
Captain Mackay and I have lived in the most perfect 
harmony since his arrival, and have reasoned on this 
calmly ; and, I believe, if we should have occasion to 
exert our whole force, we shall do as well as divided 
authority can do. We have not had the least warmth 
of dispute. He thinks you have not a power to give 
commissions, that will command him. If so, I can very 
confidently say, that his absence would tend to the public advantage. I have been particularly careful in discovering no foolish desire of commanding him, neither 
have I intermeddled with his company in the least, nor 
given any directions concerning it, except, in general, 
the countersign, and place to repair to in case of an 
alarm, none of which he thinks he should receiveo I 
have testified to him, in the most serious manner, the 
pleasure I should take in consulting and advising with 
him upon all occasions, and I am satisfied that we shall 
never differ after you have decided this point. I am 
convinced, that your own just discernment and consideration will prove to you, that there can be no medium. 
The nature of the thing will not allow of it. Before orders will be observed, it must be known who is to 
command ; and I am very confident you will see the 
absurdity, and consider the effects, of Captain Mackay's 
having the direction of the regiment ; for it would certainly be the hardest thing in life, if we are to do double 
and treble duty, and neither be entitled to the pay nor 
rank of soldiers. That the first column of the Virginia 
regiment has done more for the interest of this expedition, than any company, or corps, that will hereafter 
arrive, must be obvious to all. This, Sir, Captain Mackay 
did not hesitate one moment to allow, since he has seen 
the work we have done upon the roads. We shall part 
to-morrow. I shall continue my march to Red-stone, 
while his company remains here. This, Sir, I found 
absolutely necessary for the public interest. Captain 
Mackay says, that it is not in his power to oblige his 
men to work on the road, unless he will engage them a 
shilling sterling a day, which I would not choose to do. 
And to suffer them to march at their ease, whilst our 
faithful soldiers are laboriously employed, carries with it 
an air of such distinction, that it is not to be wondered 
at, if the poor fellows were to declare the hardship of it. 
He also assures me, that this is not peculiar to his company, but that no soldiers subject to martial law can be 
obliged to work for less. I shall continue to complete 
the work we have begun with my own men. We shall 
have the whole credit, as no others have assisted. 
</p><p>
I hope, from what has been said, your Honor will see 
the necessity of giving your speedy order on this head ; 
and I am sensible you will consider the evil tendency, 
that will accompany Captain Mackay's arrival. The 
rank of office to me, Sir, is much more important than the pay. 
</p><p>
Captain Mackay brought none of the cannon, very little ammunition, about five days' allowance of flour, 
and sixty beeves. I am much grieved to find our stores 
so slowly advancing. God knows when we shall be 
able to do any thing to deserve better of our country.
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with the most sincere and unfeigned regard, 
your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant. 
</p>
