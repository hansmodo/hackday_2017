TO RICHARD CORBIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In a conversation with you at Green Spring, you 
gave me some room to hope for a commission above 
that of major, and to be ranked among the chief officers 
of this expedition. The command of the whole forces 
is what I neither look for, expect, nor desire ; for 1 
must be impartial enough to confess, it is a charge too 
great for my youth and inexperience to be entrusted 
with. Knowing this, I have too sincere a love for my 
country, to undertake that which may tend to the 
prejudice of it. But if I could entertain hopes, that you 
thought me worthy of the post of lieutenant-colonel, 
and would favor me so far as to mention it at the 
appointment of officers, I could not but entertain a true 
sense of the kindness. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, that, under a skilful commander, or 
man of sense, (whom I most sincerely wish to serve 
under,) with my own application and diligent study of 
my duty, I shall be able to conduct my steps without 
censure, and, in time, render myself worthy of the 
promotion, that I shall be favored with now. I am, Sac. 
</p>
