DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
Immediately upon our leaving the camp at George's Creek, on the 14th instant, from whence I wrote to you, 
I was seized with a violent fever and pain of the head, which continued without intermission until the 23d, 
when I was relieved, by the General's absolutely ordering the physician to give me Dr. James's powders, one 
of the most excellent medicines in the world. It gave me immediate ease, and removed my fever and other 
complaints in four days' time. My illness was too violent to suffer me to ride ; therefore I was indebted to a 
covered wagon for some part of my transportation ; but even in this, I could not continue far. The jolting was 
so great, that I was left upon the road with a guard, and some necessaries, to wait the arrival of Colonel 
Dunbar's detachment, which was two days' march behind us, the General giving me his word of honor, that I 
should be brought up, before he reached the French fort. This promise, and the doctor's declaration, that, if 
I persevered in my attempts to go on, in the condition I then was, my life would be endangered, determined me to halt for the above mentioned detachment. 
</p><p>
As the communication between this and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a> 
must soon be too dangerous for single persons to pass, 
it will render the intercourse of letters slow and precarious ; therefore I shall attempt (and will go through it 
if I have strength) to give you an account of our proceedings, our situation, and prospects at present ; which I 
desire you will communicate to Colonel Fairfax, and 
others, my correspondents, for I am too weak to write 
more than this letter. 
</p><p>
In the letter, which I wrote to you from George's 
Creek, I acquainted you, that, unless the number of 
wagons was retrenched, and the carriage-horses increased, we should never be able to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
This, in two days afterwards (which was about the time 
they got to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, with some of their foremost wagons, and strongest teams), they themselves 
were convinced of; for they found, that, besides the 
extreme difficulty of getting the wagons along at all, 
they had often a line of three or four miles in length ; 
and the soldiers guarding them were so dispersed, that, 
if we had been attacked either in front, centre, or rear, 
the part so attacked must have been cut off, or totally 
routed, before they could be sustained by any other 
corps. 
</p><p>
At the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a> a second council was called 
(for there had been one before), wherein the urgency 
for horses was again represented to the officers of the 
different corps, and how laudable a farther retrenchment of their baggage would be, that the spare ones 
might be turned over for the public service. In order 
to encourage this, I gave up my best horse, which I 
have never heard of since, and took no more baggage 
than half my portmanteau would easily contain. It is 
said, however, that the number reduced by this second 
attempt was only from two hundred and ten or twelve, 
to two hundred, which had no perceivable effect. 
</p><p>
The General, before they met in council, asked my 
private opinion concerning the expedition. I urged him, 
in the warmest terms I was able, to push forward, if he 
even did it with a small but chosen band, with such artillery and light stores as were necessary ; leaving the 
heavy artillery, baggage, and the like with the rear division 
of the army, to follow by slow and easy marches, which 
they might do safely, while we were advanced in front. 
As one reason to support this opinion, I urged, that, if 
we could credit our intelligence, the French were weak 
at the Fork at present, but hourly expected reinforcements, which, to my certain knowledge, could not arrive 
with provisions, or any supplies, during the continuance 
of the drought, as the Buffalo River (Riviere aux Boeufs), 
down which was their only communication to Venango, 
must be as dry as we now found the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a> of 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a>, which may be passed dry-shod. 
</p><p>
This advice prevailed, and it was determined, that 
the General, with one thousand two hundred chosen 
men, and officers from all the different corps, under the 
following field officers, viz. ; Sir Peter Halket, who acts 
as brigadier ; Lieutenant- Colonel Gage, LieutenantColonel Burton, and Major Sparks, with such a number of wagons as the train would absolutely require, 
should march as soon as things could be got in readiness. This was completed, and we were on our march, 
by the 19th, leaving Colonel Dunbar and Major Chapman behind, with the residue of the two regiments, some 
Independent Companies, most of the women, and, in 
short, every thing not absolutely essential, carrying our 
provisions and other necessaries upon horses. 
</p><p>
We set out with less than thirty carriages, including 
those that transported the ammunition for the howitzers, 
twelve-pounders, and six-pounders, and all of them 
strongly horsed ; which was a prospect that conveyed 
infinite delight to my mind, though I was excessively ill 
at the time. But this prospect was soon clouded, and 
my hopes brought very low indeed, w r hen I found, that, 
instead of pushing on with vigor, without regarding a 
little rough road, they were halting to level every molehill, and to erect bridges over every brook, by which 
means we were four days in getting twelve miles. 
</p><p>
At this camp I was left by the Doctor's advice, and 
the General's positive orders, as I have already mentioned, without which I should not have been prevailed 
upon to remain behind ; as I then imagined, and now 
believe, I shall find it no easy matter to join my own 
corps again, which is twenty-five miles in advance. 
Notwithstanding, I had the General's word of honor, 
pledged in the most solemn manner, that I should 
be brought up before he arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
They have had frequent alarms, and several men have 
been scalped ; but this is done with no other design, 
than to retard the march, and to harass the men, who, 
if they are to be turned out every time a small party 
attacks the guards at night (for I am certain they have 
not sufficient force to make a serious assault), the enemy's aim will be accomplished by the gaining of time. 
</p><p>
I have been now six days with Colonel Dunbar's 
corps, who are in a miserable condition for want of 
horses, not having enough for their wagons ; so that the 
only method he has of proceeding, is to march with as 
many wagons as these will draw, and then halt till the 
remainder are brought up with the same horses, which 
requires two days more ; and shortly, I believe, he will 
not be able to stir at all. There has been vile management in regard to horses. 
</p><p>
My strength will not admit of my saying more, though 
I have not said half that I intended concerning our 
affairs here. Business I shall not think of, but depend 
solely upon your management of all my affairs, not 
doubting that they will be well conducted. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
July 2d. A serious inconvenience attended me in 
my sickness, and that was losing the use of my servant ; 
for poor John Alton was taken about the same time that 
I was, and with nearly the same disorder, and was confined as long ; so that we did not see each other for 
several days. He is also tolerably well recovered. 
</p><p>
We are advanced almost as far as the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 
and I shall set out to-morrow morning for my own corps, 
with an escort of one hundred men, who are to guard 
some provisions up, so that my fears and doubts on that 
head are now removed. 
</p><p>
I had a letter yesterday from Orme, who writes me 
word, that they have passed the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a> for the 
last time ; that they have sent out parties to scour the 
country thereabouts, and have reason to believe the 
French are greatly alarmed at their approach.
