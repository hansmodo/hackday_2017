TO SIR JOHN ST. CLAIR.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 27 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR JOHN, 
</p><p>
The post, calling suddenly upon me, only allows me time to acknowledge the receipt of your obliging letter, and to inform you, that I have received Mr. President's 
orders to obey any command you shall be pleased to honor me with ; also to tell you, that the two companies from Carolina were at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, and may be expected here daily. 
</p><p>
I have made known the contents of your letter to Mr. Gist, who thinks himself extremely obliged by the 
care you have taken of Indian affairs. We do all we can to keep the Indians in temper, but I have still apprehensions, that many of them will return home, if the troops are long in assembling. 
</p><p>
It gave me real pleasure to learn from you, that my company was desired by the General, Sir John, and Major Halket. I shall think myself quite happy, if I 
should be able to retain the good opinion, which they seem to entertain of me ; for I have long despaired of any other reward for my services, than the satisfaction arising from the esteem of my friends. 
</p><p>
I am, with great regard, yours, &,c. 
</p>
