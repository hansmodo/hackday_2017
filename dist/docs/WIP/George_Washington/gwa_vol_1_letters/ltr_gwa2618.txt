TO COLONEL WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 
</p><p>
15 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter from Rousby Hall, of 
the 4th instant. It demands my best acknowledgments 
for the particular marks of esteem you have expressed 
therein, and for the kind assurances of his Excellency 
Governor Sharpe's good wishes towards me. I also 
thank you, and sincerely, Sir, for your friendly intention 
of making my situation easy, if I return to the service; 
I should be as happy under your command in the absence of the General, as under any gentleman's whatever. 
But I think the disparity between the present offer of a 
company and my former rank too great, to expect any 
real satisfaction or enjoyment in a corps, where I once 
had, or thought I had, a right to command ; even if his 
Excellency had power to suspend the orders received 
in the Secretary of War's letter ; which, by the by, I 
am very far from thinking he has, or that he will attempt 
to do it, without fuller instructions than I believe he has 
received ; especially, too, as there has been a representation of this matter by Governor Dinwiddie, and, I 
believe, the Assembly of this province. 
</p><p>
All that I presume the General can do, is, to prevent 
the different corps from interfering, which will occasion 
the duty to be done by corps, instead of detachments ; 
a very inconvenient way, as found by experience.
</p><p>
You make mention in your letter of my continuing in the service, and retaining my colonel's commission. This idea has filled me with surprise ; for, if you think 
me capable of holding a commission, that has neither rank nor emolument annexed to it, you must entertain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness, and believe me to be more empty than the commission itself. 
</p><p>
Besides, Sir, if I had time, I could enumerate many good reasons, that forbid all thoughts of my returning ; 
and which to you, or any other person, would, upon the strictest scrutiny, appear to be well founded. I must 
be reduced to a very low command, and subjected to that of many, who have acted as my inferior officers. 
In short, every captain, bearing the King's commission, every half-pay officer, or others appearing with such a 
commission, would rank before me. For these reasons I choose to submit to the loss of health, which I have, 
however, already sustained, (not to mention that of effects,) and the fatigue I have undergone in our first 
efforts, rather than subject myself to the same inconveniences, and run the risk of a second disappointment, 
</p><p>
I shall have the consolation of knowing, that I have 
opened the way, when the smallness of our numbers 
exposed us to the attacks of a superior enemy ; that I 
have hitherto stood the heat and brunt of the day, and 
escaped untouched in time of extreme danger ; and that 
I have the thanks of my country, for the services I have 
rendered it.
</p><p>
The information I have received shall not sleep in 
silence, that those peremptory orders from home, which 
you say could not be dispensed with, for reducing the 
regiment into Independent Companies, were generated 
and hatched at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>. Ingenuous treatment and plain dealing I at least expected. It is to be hoped 
the project will answer ; it shall meet with my acquiescence in every thing except personal services. I herewith enclose Governor Sharpe's letter, which I beg you 
will return to him, with my acknowledgments for the 
favor he intended me. Assure him, Sir, as you truly 
may, of my reluctance to quit the service, and of the 
pleasure I should have received in attending his fortunes. 
Inform him, also, that it was to obey the call of honor, 
and the advice of my friends, that I declined it, and not 
to gratify any desire I had to leave the military line. 
My inclinations are strongly bent to arms. 
</p><p>
The length of this letter, and the small room I have 
left, tell me how necessary it is to conclude; which 
I will do, with the assurance that you shall always 
find me 
</p><p>
Truly and sincerely your most humble servant. 
</p>
