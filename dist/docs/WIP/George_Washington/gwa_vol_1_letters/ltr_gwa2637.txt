TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 17 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Last night by the return of the express, who went to 
Captain Montour, I received the enclosed from Mr. Harris at the Susquehanna. I think no means should be 
neglected to preserve the few Indians, who still remain 
in our interest. For which reason I shall send Mr. Gist, 
as soon as he arrives (which I expect will be to-day), 
to Harris's Ferry, in hopes of engaging and bringing 
with him the Belt of Wampum and other Indians at that 
place. I shall further desire him to send an Indian express to Andrew Montour, to try if he cannot be brought 
with them. 
</p><p>
In however trifling a light the attempts of the French 
to alienate the affections of our southern Indians may at 
first appear, I must look upon it as a thing of the utmost 
consequence, requiring our greatest and most immediate 
attention. I have often wondered at not hearing this 
was attempted before, and had it noted among other 
memorandums to acquaint your Honor with, when I 
should come down. 
</p><p>
The French policy in treating with the Indians is so 
prevalent, that I should not be in the least surprised, 
were they to engage the Cherokees, Catawbas, and 
others, unless timely and vigorous measures are taken 
to prevent it. 
</p><p>
A pusillanimous behaviour now will ill suit the times ; 
and trusting to traders and common interpreters, who 
will sell their integrity to the highest bidder, may prove 
the destruction of these affairs. I therefore think, that 
if a person of distinction, acquainted with their language, 
is to be found, his price should be come to at any rate. 
If no such person can be had, a man of sense and character, who may conduct the Indians to a council, or 
superintend any other matters, will be found extremely 
necessary. It is impertinent, I own, in me to offer my 
opinion in these affairs, when better judges may direct ; 
but my steady and hearty zeal for the cause, and the 
great impositions I have known practised by the traders 
upon these occasions, would not suffer me to be quite 
silent. I have heard, from undoubted authority, that 
some of the Cherokees, introduced to us as sachems 
and princes by the interpreter, who shares the profits, 
have been no other than common hunters, and bloodthirsty villains. 
</p><p>
We have no accounts yet of the militia from Fairfax. 
This day I march with about one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland. Yesterday an express informed me of 
eighty recruits at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, whom I have ordered 
to proceed to this place ; but, for want of that regularity 
being observed, by which I should know where every 
officer is, my orders are only conditional, and always confused. The commissary is much wanted. I hope 
you will send him up immediately ; if not, things will greatly suffer here. I am, &,c.
