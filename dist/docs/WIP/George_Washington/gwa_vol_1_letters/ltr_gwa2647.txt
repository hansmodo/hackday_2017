<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 19 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since writing my letter of yesterday's date, the enclosed came to hand, by which you will be informed of 
a very unlucky affair.
</p><p>
I immediately consulted Governor Innes, and such 
officers of my regiment as were at this place, on the 
necessary steps to be taken. They unanimously advised, that I should remain here with the fifty recruits 
that are in town, for the defence of the place, until the 
militia be raised, that we may thereby be enabled to 
compose a formidable body, and march out against the enemy. 
</p><p>
This engagement happened within twenty miles of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and the sergeant, who brought the letter, 
assures me there is reason to imagine, that their numbers are greater than the letter informs. He says there 
were many French among them, and that the chief part 
of the whole were mounted on horseback ; so that there 
is a great probability of their having a design upon this 
place. 
</p><p>
I have sent an express to Lord Fairfax, with a copy 
of Stark's letter, and have desired, in the most earnest 
manner, that he will be expeditious in calling the militia ; 
but, alas ! that is an unhappy dependence ; yet the only 
one we have. I am your Honor's, &c. 
</p>
