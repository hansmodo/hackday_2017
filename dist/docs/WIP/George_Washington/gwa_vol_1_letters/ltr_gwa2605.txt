TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, 9 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
I acquainted you by Mr. Ward with the determination, which we prosecuted four days after his departure, 
as soon as wagons arrived to carry our provisions. 
The want of proper conveyances has much retarded 
this expedition, and at this time it unfortunately delays 
the detachment I have the honor to command. Even 
when we came to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, my disappointments 
were not less than before ; for there I expected to find a 
sufficient number of packhorses provided by Captain 
Trent, conformably to his promise, and to Major Carlyle's letters and my own, that I might prosecute my 
first intention with light, expeditious marches ; but instead 
of that, there was none in readiness, nor any in expectation that I could perceive, which reduced me to the 
necessity of waiting till wagons could be procured from the Branch, forty miles distant. However, in the mean 
time, I detached a party of sixty men to make and mend 
the road, which party since the 25th of April, and the 
main body since the 1st instant, have been laboriously 
employed, and have got no farther than these Meadows, 
about twenty miles from the New Store. We have 
been two days making a bridge across the river, and 
have not done yet.
</p><p>
The great difficulty and labor, that it requires to mend and alter the road, prevent our marching above two, 
three, or four miles a day ; and I fear, though no diligence shall be spared, that we shall be detained some 
considerable time before it can be made good for the 
carriage of the artillery with Colonel Fry. 
</p><p>
We daily receive intelligence from Ohio by one or 
another of the traders, who are continually retreating to 
the inhabitants with their effects. They all concur, that 
the French are reinforced with eight hundred men; 
and this day, by one Kalendar, I received an account, 
which he sets forth as certain, that there are six hundred at the Falls of the Ohio, from whence they intend 
to move up to the lower Shawnese Town, at the mouth 
of Scioto Creek, to erect fortresses. He likewise says, 
that the forces at the Fork are erecting their works with 
their whole strength ; and as he was coming he met at 
Mr. Gist's new settlement Monsieur La Force with four 
soldiers, who, under the specious pretence of hunting 
after deserters, were reconnoitring and discovering the 
country. He also brings the agreeable news, -that the 
Half-King has received, and is much pleased with, the 
speech I sent him, and is now upon his march with fifty 
men to meet us. The French down the river are sending presents and invitations to all the neighbouring 
Indians. 
</p><p>
We have heard nothing from the Catawbas, or any of 
the Southern Indians, though this is the time we mostly 
need their assistance. I have not above one hundred 
and sixty effective men with me, since Captain Trent's 
have left us, whom I discharged from this detachment, 
and ordered them to wait your commands at Captain 
Trent's ; for I found them rather injurious to the other 
men, than serviceable to the expedition, till they could 
be upon the same establishment with us, and come 
under the rigor of martial law. I am, &c. 
</p>
