<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 5 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Duty to my country, and his Majesty's interest, indispensably require, that I again trouble your Honor on the 
subject of Indian affairs here, which have been impeded 
and embarrassed by such a train of mismanagement, as, 
if continued, must produce melancholy consequences. 
</p><p>
The sincere disposition of the Cherokees heartily to 
espouse our cause has been demonstrated beyond every 
doubt ; and, if they were rewarded in a proper manner, 
it would, in all probability, be the means of effecting a 
favorable change in the present unhappy situation of 
this part of his Majesty's dominions. 
</p><p>
But, instead of meeting with the encouragement, 
which their services and bravery have merited, several 
of them, after having undergone the toils and fatigues of 
long marches, destitute of the conveniences and almost 
of the necessaries of life, have, in that situation, gone to 
war, and behaved nobly, from which we have reaped a 
signal advantage. When returned here, with their trophies of honor, they must have gone home without any 
kind of reward or thanks, or even provisions to support 
them on their march, justly fired with resentment, had 
not I and my officers procured them some things, of 
which they were in absolute want, and made it the object of our care, in various respects, to please them. 
</p><p>
Another party of those Indians since arrived opportunely to our assistance, at the very juncture the enemy 
made an irruption into this settlement, pursued their 
tracks, came up with three of them, scalped two, and 
wounded the third. They are now returned from the 
pursuit, and are nearly in the same situation with those 
abovementioned. I applied to Captain Gist in their behalf, and told him I must represent the matter to your 
Honor. But he assures me, that he has neither goods, 
money to procure them, nor even an interpreter, being 
thereby incapable of doing any kind of service. It is 
surprising, that any man should be entrusted with transacting such important affairs, and not be possessed of 
the means. Thus he, and several others, who receive 
high pay from Virginia, are not only rendered useless, 
but our interest with those Indians is at the brink of destruction. Whenever any of them arrive here, they immediately apply to me ; but I have neither any thing to 
give them, nor any right to do it. Nor is there a person, who can inform them to what these and their other 
disappointments are owing; which reduces me to a 
dilemma, from which I would most gladly be extricated. 
</p><p>
I must likewise beg leave to mention once more the 
vast hardships, which many of the people groan under 
here, from having been so long kept out of the money, 
that the country owes them on account of the Indians. 
</p><p>
When I proposed going down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, several of them brought their accounts to me, which I 
intended, had you given me liberty, to lay before your 
Honor. I mention this circumstance, not with any view 
of being employed in examining and paying off those 
accounts, which for many reasons I can by no means 
undertake, but in hope that your Honor will be pleased 
to give directions, and appoint some person to that duty, 
by the neglect of which so many poor people greatly 
suffer. I am, &c. 
</p>
