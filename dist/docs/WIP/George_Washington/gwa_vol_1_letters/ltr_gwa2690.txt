TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL FORBES.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Permit .me to return you my sincere thanks for the honor you were pleased to do me, in a letter to Mr. President Blair, and to assure you, that to merit a continuance of the good opinion you have expressed of me, shall be among my principal endeavours. I have no higher ambition, than to act my part well during the campaign ; and if I should thereby merit your approbation, it will be a most pleasing reward for the toils I shall undergo. 
</p><p>
It gives me no small pleasure, that an officer of your 
experience, abilities, and good character should be appointed to command the expedition, and it is with equal 
satisfaction I congratulate you upon the promising prospect of a glorious campaign. 
</p><p>
The Indians seem to anticipate our success, by joining us, thus early, with seven hundred of their warriors. Captain Bosomworth, who held a conference with their 
chiefs, can fully inform you of their good inclinations to assist his Majesty's troops, and to him I refer you. Two things, however, I must beg leave to indicate, as likely 
to contribute greatly to their ease and contentment; namely, an early campaign, and plenty of goods. These are matters, which they often remind us of, both in their public councils and private conferences. 
</p><p>
I have received no orders yet to assemble the dispersed companies of the Virginia regiment, some of whom are two hundred miles distant from this place ; 
so that, I fear, we shall make a sorry appearance at the general rendezvous. We are very much in want of tents, and have none with which to encamp the regiment when it assembles. This fort cannot yet furnish 
barracks, nor can the town supply quarters sufficient. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with very great respect, your most obedient 
and most obliged humble servant. 
</p>
