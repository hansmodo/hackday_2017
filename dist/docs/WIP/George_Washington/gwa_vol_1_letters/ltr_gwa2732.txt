TO LORD BOTETOURT, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 15 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1770">1770</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
Being fully persuaded of your Excellency's inclination to render every just and reasonable service to the 
people you govern, or to any body or society of them, 
that shall ask it, and being encouraged in a more particular manner by a letter, which I have just received from 
Mr. Blair, clerk of the Council, to believe, that your 
Lordship is desirous of being fully informed how far the 
grant of land solicited by Mr. Walpole and others will 
affect the interest of this country in general, or individuals in particular, I shall take the liberty (as I am pretty 
intimately acquainted with the situation of the frontiers 
of this dominion) to inform your Lordship, that the 
bounds of that grant, if obtained upon the extensive plan proposed, will comprehend at least four fifths of the 
land, for the purchase and survey of which this government has lately voted two thousand five hundred pounds 
sterling. It must, therefore, destroy the well grounded 
hopes of those, (if no reservation is made in their favor,) 
who have had the strongest assurances, that the government could give, of enjoying a certain portion of the 
lands, which have cost this country so much blood and 
treasure to secure. 
</p><p>
By the extracts, which your Excellency did me the 
honor to enclose, I perceive, that the petitioners propose 
to begin opposite to the mouth of the Scioto River, 
which is at least seventy or seventy-five miles below the 
Great Kenhawa, and more than three hundred from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, and to extend from thence in a southwardly 
direction through the pass of the Ouasioto Mountain, 
which, by Evans's map, and the best accounts I have 
been able to get from persons, who have explored that 
country, will bring them near the latitude of North 
Carolina. Thence they proceed northeastwardly to the 
Kenhawa, at the junction of New River and Green 
Briar, upon both of which waters we have many settlers 
upon lands actually patented. From that point they go 
up the Green Briar to the head of its northeasterly 
branch, thence easterly to the Allegany Mountains, 
thence along these mountains to the line of Lord Fairfax, and thence with his line, and the lines of Maryland 
and Pennsylvania, till the west boundary of the latter 
intersects the Ohio, and finally down that river to the 
place of beginning.
</p><p>
These, my Lord, are the bounds of a grant prayed for, and which, if obtained, will give a fatal blow, in my 
humble opinion, to the interests of this country. But these are my sentiments as a member of the community 
at large. I now beg leave to offer myself to your Excellency's notice, in a more interested point of view, 
as an individual, 'and as a person, who considers himself in some degree the representative of the officers and 
soldiers, who claim a right to two hundred thousand 
acres of this very land, under a solemn act of government, adopted at a period very important and critical to 
his Majesty's affairs in this part of the world. I shall, therefore, rely on your Lordship's accustomed goodness 
and candor, w r hilst I add a few words in support of the equity of our pretensions, although, in truth, I have very 
little to say on this subject now, which I have not heretofore taken the liberty of observing to your Excellency. 
The first letter I ever did myself the honor of writing 
to you, on the subject of this land, and to which I beg 
leave to refer, contained a kind of historical account of 
our claim ; but as there requires nothing more to elucidate a right, than to offer a candid exhibition of the 
case, supported by facts, I shall beg leave to refer your 
Lordship to an order of Council, of the 18th of February, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, and to Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, which 
issued in consequence of that order, both of which are 
enclosed. I will next add, that these troops not only 
enlisted agreeably to the proclamation, but behaved so 
much to the satisfaction of the country, as to be honored 
with the most public acknowledgments of it by the Assembly. Would it not be hard, then, my Lord, to deprive men under these circumstances, or their representatives, of the just reward of their toils ? Was not this 
act of the Governor and Council offered to the soldiers, 
and accepted by them, as an absolute compact ? And 
though the exigency of affairs, or the policy of government, made it necessary to continue these lands in a 
dormant state for some time, ought not their claim to be considered, in preference to all others ? When the 
causes cease, we fain would hope so. We flatter ourselves, that it will also appear to your Lordship in this 
point of view, and that, by your kind interposition, and 
favorable representation of the case, his Majesty will be 
graciously pleased to confirm this land to us, agreeably 
to a petition presented to your Excellency in Council on 
the 15th of last December; with this difference only, 
that, instead of Sandy Creek (one of the places allotted 
for the location of our grant, and which we now certainly know will not be comprehended within the ministerial 
line, as it is called), we may be allowed to lay a part of 
our grant between the west boundary of Pennsylvania 
and the river Ohio, which will be expressly agreeable to 
the words of Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, inasmuch as it is contiguous to the Fork of the Monongahela. 
This favor, my Lord, would be conferring a singular obligation on soldiers, most of whom, either in their persons or fortunes, have suffered in the cause of their 
country ; and it cannot fail to receive the thanks of a 
grateful body of men, but of none more warmly than of 
your Lordship's most obedient and humble servant.
