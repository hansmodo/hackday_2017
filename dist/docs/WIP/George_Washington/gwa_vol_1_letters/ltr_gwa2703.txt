<p>
TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 2 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The matters, of which we spoke relative to the roads, 
have, since our parting, been the subject of my closest 
reflection ; and, so far am I from altering my opinion, 
that, the more time and attention I bestow, the more I 
am confirmed in it ; and the reasons for taking Braddock's road appear in a stronger point of view. To 
enumerate the whole of these reasons would be tedious, 
and to you, who are become so much master of the 
subject, unnecessary. I shall, therefore, briefly mention 
a few only, which I think so obvious in themselves, that 
they must effectually remove objections. 
</p><p>
Several years ago the Virginians and Pennsylvanians 
commenced a trade with the Indians settled on the Ohio, 
and, to obviate the many inconveniences of a bad road, 
they, after reiterated and ineffectual efforts to discover 
where a good one might be made, employed for the purpose several of the most intelligent Indians, who, in the 
course of many years' hunting, had acquired a perfect knowledge of these mountains. The Indians, having taken the greatest pains to gain the rewards offered 
for this discovery, declared, that the path leading from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a> was infinitely preferable to any, that could 
be made at any other place. Time and experience so 
clearly demonstrated this truth, that the Pennsylvania traders commonly carried out their goods by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>. 
Therefore, the Ohio Company, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1753">1753</a>, at a considerable 
expense, opened the road. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a> the troops, whom 
I had the honor to command, greatly repaired it, as far 
as Gist's plantation; and, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>, it was widened and 
completed by General Braddock to within six miles of Port Duquesne. A road, that has so long been opened, 
and so well and so often repaired, must be much firmer 
and better than a new one, allowing the ground to be 
equally good. 
</p><p>
But, supposing it were practicable to make a road 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> quite as good as General Braddock's, 
I ask, have we time to do it ? Certainly not. To surmount the difficulties to be encountered in making it 
over such mountains, covered with woods and rocks, 
would require so much time, as to blast our otherwise 
well-grounded hopes of striking the important stroke 
this season. 
</p><p>
The favorable accounts, that some give of the forage 
on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> road, as being so much better than 
that on the other, are certainly exaggerated. It is well 
known, that, on both routes, the rich valleys between the 
mountains abound with good forage, and that those, 
which are stony and bushy, are destitute of it. Colonel 
Byrd and the engineer, who accompanied him, confirm 
this fact. Surely the meadows on Braddock's road 
would greatly overbalance the advantage of having grass 
to the foot of the ridge, on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> road ; and all 
agree, that a more barren road is nowhere to be found, 
than that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> to the inhabitants, which is likewise to be considered. 
</p><p>
Another principal objection made to General Braddock's road is in regard to the waters. But these seldom swell so much, as to obstruct the passage. The 
Youghiogany River, which is the most rapid and soonest 
filled, I have crossed with a body of troops, after more 
than thirty days' almost continued rain. In fine, any 
difficulties on this score are so trivial, that they really 
are not worth mentioning. The Monongahela, the largest of all these rivers, may, if necessary, easily be 
avoided, as Mr. Frazer the principal guide informs me, by passing a defile, and even that, he says, may be shunned. 
</p><p>
Again, it is said, there are many defiles on this road. 
I grant that there are some, but I know of none that 
may not be traversed ; and I should be glad to be informed where a road can be had, over these mountains, 
not subject to the same inconvenience. The shortness 
of the distance between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a> is 
used as an argument against this road, which bears in it 
something unaccountable to me ; for I must beg leave to 
ask, whether it requires more time, or is more difficult 
and expensive, to go one hundred and forty-five miles 
in a good road already made to our hands, than to cut 
one hundred miles anew, and a great part of the way 
over impassable mountains. 
</p><p>
That the old road is many miles nearer Winchester 
in Virginia, and Fort Frederic in Maryland, than the 
contemplated one, is incontestable ; and I will here show 
the distances from Carlisle by the two routes, fixing the 
different stages, some of which I have from information 
only, but others I believe to be exact From this computation there appears to be a difference of nineteen 
miles only. Were all the supplies necessarily to come 
from Carlisle, it is well known, that the goodness of the 
old road is a sufficient compensation for the shortness 
of the other, as the wrecked and broken wagons there 
clearly demonstrate. 
</p><p>
I shall next give you my reasons against dividing the 
army, in the manner you propose. 
</p><p>
First, then, by dividing our army, we shall divide our 
strength, and, by pursuing quite distinct routes, put it 
entirely out of the power of each division to succour the 
other, as the proposed new road has no communication 
with the old one. 
</p><p>
Secondly, to march in this manner will be attended 
with many inconveniences. If we depart from our advanced posts at the same time, and make no deposits 
by the way, those troops that go from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, as 
they will be light, with carrying-horses only, will arrive 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> long before the others, and must, if 
the enemy are strong there, be exposed to many insults 
in their advance, and in their intrenchments, from the 
cannon of the enemy, which they may draw out upon 
them at pleasure. If they are not strong enough to do 
this, we have but little to apprehend from them, in 
whatever way w r e may go. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, if that division, which escorts the convoy, is 
permitted to march first, we risk our all, in a manner, 
and shall be ruined if any accident happens to the artillery and the stores. 
</p><p>
Lastly, if we advance on both roads, by deposits, we 
must double our number of troops over the mountains, 
and distress ourselves by victualling them at these deposits, besides losing the proposed advantage, that of 
stealing a march. For, we cannot suppose that the 
French, who have their scouts constantly out, can be so deficient in point of intelligence, as to be unacquainted 
with our motions, while we are advancing by slow degrees towards them. 
</p><p>
From what has been said relative to the two roads, i 
appears to me very clear, that the old one is infinite! 
better, than the other can be made, and that there is no 
room to hesitate in deciding which to take, when we 
consider the advanced season, and the little time left to 
execute our plan. 
</p><p>
I shall, therefore, in the last place offer, as desired, 
my sentiments on advancing by deposits. The first deposit I should have proposed to be at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, had time permitted ; but, as the case now stands, 
I think it should be at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a>, or the Great 
Meadows. The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a> I esteem the most advantageous post, on several accounts, especially on 
those of water and security of passage ; but then it does 
not abound with forage, as the Meadows do, nor with so 
much level land fit for culture. To this latter place a 
body of fifteen hundred men may march with three 
hundred wagons (or with carrying-horses, which would 
be much better), allowing each wagon to carry eight 
hundred weight of flour and four hundred of salt meat. 
</p><p>
Our next deposit will probably be at Salt Lick, about 
thirty-five miles from the Meadows. To this place I 
think it necessary to send two thousand five hundred 
men, to construct some post, taking six days' provisions 
only, which is sufficient to serve them till the convoy 
comes up, by which time an entrenched camp, or some 
other defensive work, may be effected. From hence I 
conceive it highly expedient to detach three or four 
thousand of the best troops to invest the fort, and to 
prevent, if possible, an engagement in the woods, which 
of all things ought to be avoided. The artillery and stores may be brought up in four days from Salt Lick. 
</p><p>
From that time I will allow eighteen days more, for the 
carrying-horses to make a trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> for provisions, passing along the old path by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>. They 
may do it in this time, as the horses will go down light 
From this statement, and by my calculations, in which 
large allowance is made for the quantity of provisions, 
as well as for the time of transporting them, it appears 
that, from the day on which the front division begins its 
march, till the whole army arrives before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, 
will be thirty-four days. There will be, also, eightyseven days' provision on hand, allowing for the consumption on the march. Eighteen days added to the 
above will make fifty-two in all, the number required for 
our operations. These ought to be finished, if possible, 
by the middle of October. I am, &c.
