SIR, 
</p><p>
The enclosed is a copy of my last. We have been 
curiously entertained, of late, with the description of an 
engine lately constructed, I believe, in Switzerland, and 
which has undergone some improvements in England, 
for taking up trees by the roots. It is related, that trees 
of a considerable diameter are forced up by this engine ; 
that six hands, in working one of them, will raise two or 
three hundred trees in the space of a day ; and that an 
acre of ground may be eased of the trees, and laid fit 
for ploughing, in the same time. How far these assertions have been realized by repeated experiment, it is 
impossible for me at this distance to determine ; but, if 
the accounts are not greatly exaggerated, such powerful 
assistance must be of vast utility in many parts of this 
woody country, where it is impossible for our force (and 
laborers are not to be hired here), between the finishing 
of one crop and the preparation for another, to clear 
ground fast enough to afford the proper changes, eithei 
in the planting or farming business. 
</p><p>
The chief purport of this letter, therefore, is to beg 
fhe favor of you to make minute inquiries into the trials, 
that have been made by order of the Society, and, ii 
they have proved satisfactory, to send me one of thes< 
engines by the first ship bound to the Potomac Rivei 
If they are made of different sizes, I should prefer on< 
of a middle size, capable of raising a tree of fifteen or 
eighteen inches diameter. The cost I am a stranger to. 
Fifteen, twenty, and twenty -five guineas have been 
mentioned ; but the price, were it double these sums, I 
should totally disregard, provided the engine is capable 
of performing what is related of it, and not of that complicated nature, which would cause it to be easily disordered, and rendered unfit for use, but constructed 
upon so plain, simple, and durable a plan, that the common artificers of this country may be able to repair it, if 
any accidents should happen. Should you send me 
one, be so good as to let me have with it the most ample directions for its use, together with a model of its 
manner of operating. I am, &,c.
