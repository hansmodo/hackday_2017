TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 18 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of yesterday, intimating a 
probability of my proceeding with a body of troops, on 
General Braddock's road, and desiring me to retain for 
that purpose a month's provisions at this place, a thing 
I should be extremely fond of; but, as I cannot possibly 
know what quantity of provisions may be necessary for 
that time, without knowing the number of men I may 
probably march with, and when it is likely I may leave 
this place, I hope you will be pleased to give me the 
necessary information on that head ; and, also, how this 
post is to be garrisoned, and what provision and stores 
should be left here.
</p><p>
I have talked a good deal with Kelly upon the nature 
of the intervening ground between the new road and 
Braddock's, and, from what he says, I apprehend it impracticable to effect a junction with the troops on the 
new road, till we advance near the Salt Lick, which is at 
no great distance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. How far it may 
be advisable to send a small body of troops so near the 
enemy, and at so great a distance from the army, without any tools for repairing the roads, or throwing up any 
kind of defences in case of need, I shall not presume to 
say. But I cannot help observing, that all the guides 
and Indians are to be drawn from hence, and that the greater part of my regiment is on the other road, so that 
I have but few of the first regiment remaining with me, and eight companies of the second only, whose officers 
and men cannot be supposed to know much of the service, or of the country, and nearly, if not quite, a fifth of 
them sick. I thought it incumbent on me to mention these things, that you may know our condition. At the 
same time I beg leave to assure you, that nothing will give me greater pleasure than to proceed with any number of men, that the General or yourself shall think proper to order. 
</p><p>
With regard to keeping out a succession of strong 
parties on this road, from the troops here, I must beg 
leave to remark, that we have not so much as one packhorse upon which to take provisions, having been under 
the necessity the other day of pressing five horses from 
some countrymen, who came to camp upon business, 
before I could equip Captain M c Kenzie's party for a 
fourteen days' inarch. We have not an ounce of salt 
provision of any kind here, and it is impossible to preserve the fresh, especially as we have no salt, by any 
other means than barbacuing it in the Indian manner. 
In doing this, nearly half is lost, so that a party receiving 
ten days' provisions will be obliged to live upon little 
better than five days' allowance of meat, a thing impracticable. 
</p><p>
A great many of Colonel Byrd's men are very sickly ; 
the rest are become dejected. This sickness and depression of spirits cannot arise from the situation of our 
camp, which is undoubtedly the most healthy of any 
ground in this vicinity, but is occasioned, I apprehend, 
by the change in their mode of living, and by the limestone water. The soldiers of the first regiment, like 
those of the second, would be sickly, were it not owing to some such causes. 
</p><p>
We have reason to believe, that parties of the enemy are about us, a wagoner having been shot yesterday 
afternoon, and his horse killed under him, not more than three miles from this place. 
</p><p>
We have no Indian goods of any kind here. It gives me great pleasure to learn, that the General is getting 
better, and is expected soon at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>. I am, &,c. 
</p>
