<p>
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 20 February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> the day after the date of 
my letter, but found I was unable to proceed, my fever 
and pain increasing upon me to a high degree ; and the 
physicians assured me, that I might endanger my life by 
prosecuting the journey. 
</p><p>
In consequence of that advice I returned to this place 
again, and informed your Honor of the reason of my 
detention by the post, whom I met on the road, and 
who, I have since understood, never lodged my letter in 
the postoffice at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, which is the cause of 
my now writing to the same purport. When I shall be 
sufficiently able to attempt the journey again, I cannot 
say; but I shall make no delay after I am in a condition 
to perform it. I am, &,c. 
</p>
