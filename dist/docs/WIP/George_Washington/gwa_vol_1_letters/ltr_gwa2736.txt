<p>
TO WILLIAM EDWARDS, GOVERNOR OF WEST FLORIDA. 
</p><p>
Virginia, 25 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Wood, the bearer of this, is a gentleman of Virginia, going upon a tour to Florida. He proposes, 
before his return, to explore some of the ungranted 
lands in your government ; and, as I have never yet 
been able to designate the lands to which I am em titled 
under his Majesty's proclamation of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>, 
he has promised, if he meets with such lands as he 
thinks will answer my purpose, to have ten thousand 
acres surveyed for me. To five thousand acres I am 
entitled in my own right, by virtue of that proclamation j 
to the residue by purchase, certificates of which will be 
presented to your Excellency by Mr. Wood, under the 
hand and seal of Lord Dunmore, our present governor. 
</p><p>
My entire ignorance of the climate and soil, the advantages and disadvantages, of the country of West 
Florida, is the reason why his Lordship's certificates are 
couched in such general terms ; and of my giving Mr. 
Wood a discretionary power to select the lands, or not, 
as he may be influenced by these appearances. Should 
he meet with a spot favorable to my wishes, I have no 
doubt of your Excellency's granting the land, with such 
indulgences as have been practised in similar cases, 
agreeably to his Majesty's gracious intention, with the 
terms of which I shall endeavour strictly to comply. 
</p><p>
Could I, Sir, a stranger, take it upon me with propriety to recommend Mr. Wood, I should briefly add, 
that he is a gentleman well esteemed in Virginia, and I 
am persuaded will duly appreciate any little civilities 
you may be pleased to bestow on him. I have the 
honor to be, Sir, with very great respect, &,c. 
</p>
