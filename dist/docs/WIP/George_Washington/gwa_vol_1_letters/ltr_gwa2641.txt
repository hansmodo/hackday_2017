<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 14 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Major Lewis, being at Winchester when your letter 
came to hand, was immediately despatched to Augusta, 
to take upon him the command of the troops destined 
against the Shawanese Town ; with orders to follow 
such directions as he should receive from you. This 
scheme I am apprehensive will prove abortive, as we 
are told that those Indians are removed up the river, 
into the neighbourhood of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
I have given all necessary orders for- training the men 
to a proper use of their arms, and the method of Indian 
fighting, and hope in a little time to make them expert. 
I should be glad to have your Honor's express commands, either to prepare for taking the field, or for 
guarding our frontiers in the spring, because the steps 
for these two operations are very different. I have 
already built two forts on Patterson's Creek, which have 
caused the chief part of the inhabitants to return to their 
plantations ; and have now ordered Captain Waggener 
with sixty men to build and garrison two others, at 
places I have pointed out high up the South Branch, 
which will be a means of securing near a hundred miles 
of our frontiers, exclusive of the command at Fort Dinwiddie, on Jackson's River. And, indeed, without a 
much greater number of men than we have a prospect 
of raising, I do not see how it is possible to think of 
passing the mountains, or acting more than defensively. 
This seems to be the full determination of the Pennsylvanians; so that there can be no hope of assistance 
from that quarter. If we only act defensively, I would 
most earnestly recommend the building of a strong fort at some convenient place in Virginia, as that in Maryland [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>], not to say any thing of its 
situation, which is extremely bad, will ever be an eyesore to this colony, and attended with more inconveniences than it is possible to enumerate. One instance 
of this I have taken notice of, in a letter that accompanies this, and many more I could recite, were it 
necessary. 
</p><p>
If we take the field, there is not time to carry on a 
work of this kind, but we should immediately set about 
engaging wagons, horses, forage, pack-saddles, &c. 
And here I cannot help remarking, that I believe it will 
be impossible to get wagons or horses sufficient, unless 
the old score is paid off; as the people are really ruined 
for want of their money, and complain justly of their 
grievances. 
</p><p>
I represented in my last the inconveniences of the 
late act of Assembly, which obliges us first to send to 
your Honor for a commission to hold general courtsmartial, and then to delay execution until a warrant can 
be had from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. I hope you will take the 
thing into consideration. We have several deserters 
now on hand, whom I have taken by rigorous measures, 
and who should be made examples to others, as this 
practice is continued with greater spirit than ever. 
</p><p>
Unless clothing is soon provided, the men will be unfit 
for any kind of service. And I know of no expedient to 
procure clothes, but by sending to the northward, as 
cloth cannot be had here. I left, among other returns, 
an exact account of the clothing at every place, when I 
was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. I shall not care to lay in provisions for more than a thousand men, unless I have 
your orders. We have put out such of the beeves as 
were unfit for slaughtering. If they survive the winter, 
they may be useful in the summer. 
</p><p>
Ensign Poison has received a commission in Colonel Gage's regiment, and has thus left a vacancy, which, 
with your approbation, will be filled by Mr. Dennis M c Carty, whom you once appointed a captain. He has 
continued a volunteer ever since, and has recruited several men. I hope your Honor will allow me the liberty, 
as you once promised, of filling up the vacancies, as they happen, with the volunteers, who serve with that 
expectation. We have several with us, who appear to be very deserving young gentlemen. I shall observe 
the strictest justice hi promoting them according to their merit, and their time of entering the service. 
</p><p>
The skipper of the vessels has embezzled some of the stores ; but for want of a particular invoice of them, 
we cannot ascertain the loss. He is kept in confinement until your Honor's pleasure is known. I am, &c.
