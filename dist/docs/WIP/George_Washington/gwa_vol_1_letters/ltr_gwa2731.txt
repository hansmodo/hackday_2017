DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Herewith you will receive a letter and sundry papers, f which were forwarded to me a day or two ago 
by Dr. Ross of Bladensburg. I transmit them with the 
greater pleasure, as my own desire of knowing your 
sentiments upon a matter of this importance exactly coincides with the Doctor's inclinations. 
</p><p>
At a time, when our lordly masters in Great Britain will 
be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of 
American freedom, it seems highly necessary that something should be done to avert the stroke, and maintain 
the liberty, which we have derived from our ancestors. 
But the manner of doing it, to answer the purpose effectually, is the point in question. 
</p><p>
That no man should scruple, or hesitate a moment, to 
use arms in defence of so valuable a blessing, is clearly 
my opinion. Yet arms, I would beg leave to add, 
should be the last resource, the dernier resort. We 
have already, it is said, proved the inefficacy of addresses to the throne, and remonstrances to Parliament. 
How far, then, their attention to our rights and privileges 
is to be awakened or alarmed, by starving their trade 
and manufactures, remains to be tried. ' 
</p><p>
The northern colonies, it appears, are endeavouring to adopt this scheme. In my opinion it is a good one, and 
must be attended with salutary effects, provided it can 
be carried pretty generally into execution. But to what 
extent it is practicable to do so, I will not take upon me 
to determine. That there will be a difficulty attending 
the execution of it every where, from clashing interests, 
and selfish, designing men, ever attentive to their own 
gain, and watchful of every turn, that can assist their lucrative views, cannot be denied; and in the tobacco 
colonies, where the trade is so diffused, and in a manner 
wholly conducted by factors for their principals at home 
[in England], these difficulties are certainly enhanced, 
but I think not insurmountably increased, if the gentlemen in their several counties will be at some. pains to 
explain matters to the people, and stimulate them to 
cordial agreements to purchase none but certain enumerated articles out of any of the stores after a definite 
period, and neither import nor purchase any themselves. 
This, if it should not effectually withdraw the factors 
from their importations, would at least make them extremely cautious in doing it, as the prohibited goods 
could be vended to none but the non-associators, or 
those who would pay no regard to their association ; 
both of whom ought to be stigmatized, and made the 
objects of public reproach. 
</p><p>
The more I consider a scheme of this sort, the more 
ardently I wish success to it, because I think there are 
private as well as public advantages to result from it, 
the former certain, however precarious the other may 
prove. In respect to the latter, I have always thought, 
that by virtue of the same power, which assumes the 
right of taxation, the Parliament may attempt at least to 
restrain our manufactures, especially those of a public 
nature, the same equity and justice prevailing in the one 
case as the other, it being no greater hardship to forbid 
my manufacturing, than it is to order me to buy goods 
loaded with duties, for the express purpose of raising a 
revenue. But as a measure of this sort would be an 
additional exertion of arbitrary power, we cannot be 
placed in a worse condition, I think, by putting it to the 
test. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, that the colonies are considerably 
indebted to Great Britain, is a truth universally acknowledged. That many families are reduced almost, 
if not quite, to penury and want by the low ebb of their 
fortunes, and that estates are daily selling for the discharge of debts, the public papers furnish too many 
melancholy proofs. That a scheme of this sort will 
contribute more effectually than any other that can be 
devised to extricate the country from the distress it at 
present labors under, I most firmly believe, if it can be 
generally adopted. And I can see but one class of 
people, the merchants excepted, w r ho will not, or ought 
not, to wish well to the scheme, namely, they who live 
genteelly and hospitably on clear estates. Such as these, 
were they not to consider the valuable object in view, 
and the good of others, might think it hard to be curtailed in their living and enjoyments. As to the penurious man, he would thereby save his money and his 
credit, having the best plea for doing that, which before, 
perhaps, he had the most violent struggles to refrain 
from doing. The extravagant and expensive man has 
the same good plea to retrench his expenses. He 
would be furnished with a pretext to live within bounds, 
and embrace it. Prudence dictated economy before, 
but his resolution was too weak to put it in practice ; 
" For how can I," says he, " who have lived in such and 
such a manner, change my method ? I am ashamed to 
do it, and, besides, such an alteration .in the system of 
my living will create suspicions of the decay of my fortune, and such a thought the world must not harbour." 
He continues his course, till at last his estate comes to 
an end, a sale of it being the consequence of his perseverance in error. This I am satisfied is the way, 
that many, who have set out in the wrong track, have 
reasoned, till ruin has stared them in the face. And in 
respect to the needy man, he is only left in the same 
situation that he was found in, better, I may say, because, as he judges from comparison, his condition is 
amended in proportion as it approaches nearer to those 
above him. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, therefore, I think the scheme a good 
one, and that it ought to be tried here, with such alterations as our circumstances render absolutely necessary. 
But in what manner to begin the work, is a matter 
worthy of consideration. Whether it can be attempted 
with propriety or efficacy, further than a communication 
of sentiments to one another, before May, when the 
Court and Assembly will meet at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and a 
uniform plan can be concerted, and sent into the different counties to operate at the same time and in the 
same manner everywhere, is a thing upon which I am 
somewhat in doubt, and I should be glad to know your 
opinion. I am, &c.
