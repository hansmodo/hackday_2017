TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 16 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This instant the enclosed letters came to my hands. 
I have not lost a moment's time in transmitting them to 
you, as I look upon the intelligence to be of the utmost 
importance. If the enemy are coming down in such 
numbers, and with such a train of artillery, as we are bid 
to expect, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> must inevitably fall into 
their hands, as no timely efforts can be made to relieve 
the garrison. I send you a copy of a council of war 
held upon this occasion. The advice I intend to pursue, 
until I receive orders. It is morally certain, that the next 
object, which the French have in view, is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 
and that is yet in a very untenable posture. They have 
no roads for carriages into any other province, except 
through this ; and there lies a quantity of stores here, belonging to his Majesty and to this colony, very much 
exposed and unguarded. 
</p><p>
I shall not take up your time, with a tedious detail. 
You will be a sufficient judge of the present situation 
of affairs, from the circumstances already related. I 
have written to the commanding officers of Fairfax, 
Prince William, and Culpeper counties, (a copy of the 
letters I enclose,) requesting them to march part of their 
militia to this place immediately, that no time may be 
lost. You may be assured, Sir, I shall make the best 
defence I can, if attacked. I am, &,e. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have written to Colonel Stanwix an account 
of this affair, and enclosed him copies of the letters and 
council of war. 
</p>
