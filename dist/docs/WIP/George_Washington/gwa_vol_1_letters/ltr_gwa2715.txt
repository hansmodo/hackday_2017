<p>
TO GENERAL FORBES.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, 30 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
As the Governor writes fully to you, respecting the 
posture of affairs here, and the present system of management, I have little to add. I hoped a General Assembly would be called immediately ; but the Council 
were of opinion, that, as they had met so lately, and 
were summoned to attend some time in February, it 
would be inconvenient to convene them sooner ; so that 
no measures for securing the communication between 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, or, in short, any thing else, can be effected, or even attempted, until that time. 
</p><p>
Captain M c Neil, who commanded the first Virginia 
regiment in my absence, committed an error, I am informed, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, in confining Mr. Hoops, the commissary. I am not thoroughly acquainted with the 
particulars, but I believe, from the accounts received, 
that Mr. Hoops was equally culpable in detaining the 
provisions from half- starved men. This piece of rashness, 
I am told, is likely to bring M c Neil into trouble. I therefore beg the favor of you, Sir, as I am well convinced 
M c Neil had nothing in view but the welfare of his men, 
to interpose your kind offices to settle the difference. 
This will be doing a favor to Captain M c Neil, as well as 
to myself. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely glad to hear of your safe arrival at head-quarters, after a fatiguing campaign, and that 
a perfect return of health has contributed to crown your 
successes. I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.
</p>
