<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 25 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor will be as much surprised, 
as I have been concerned and vexed, at my stay here. 
</p><p>
When I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, I did it with a design to 
proceed with the utmost expedition to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> to dinner, the day 
after I left your Honor, at one o'clock, and gave the 
officer, posted at that place, a List of such tools as were 
wanted to build the chain of forts, and ordered them to 
be sent by a wagon, pressed for that purpose, immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, to which place I repaired to get 
every thing in readiness, and wait their coming to escort 
them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I thought it needless to 
proceed without them, as nothing can be done for want 
of tools. I have sent two or three expresses to hurry 
them on, and shall make no delay when they arrive. 
I intend to take the advice of a council of war, when I 
arrive at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, as to the line on which these 
forts are to be erected, and shall visit all the grounds 
that I conveniently can, and direct the building. 
</p><p>
It is a work, that must be conducted tediously for 
these reasons, namely, the scarcity of tools, the smallness of our numbers, and the want of conductors. 
</p><p>
The strength of our forces will not admit of many 
divisions, because, in that case, each party may probably 
be diminished. We can, therefore, only attempt, with 
such men as can be drawn out of the garrisons already 
established, to build fort after fort, and not, by attempting 
too many at a time, thereby run the risk of having the 
whole demolished. To go on in the manner above 
mentioned must be extremely tedious, unless you will 
be pleased to put the militia upon our southern frontiers 
under the command of Captain Hogg, and order them 
to begin on the Mayo River, and proceed in their building until they meet our parties, who will advance southward. I can point out no other method at present to 
expedite this necessary work. 
</p><p>
If you approve this scheme, and will let me know it 
by an express, I shall despatch another with the information to Captain Hogg, and enclose to him such a plan, 
as the whole will be directed by. Your orders to the 
militia, and indeed to the inhabitants of these parts, to 
assist with their advice in fixing upon the places, and 
with their labor in forwarding the work, are absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
Your Honor never gave me a decisive answer to a 
question I asked, about assigning companies to the fieldofficers. For this reason I have presumed to repeat it 
again, because there are two companies now vacant, by 
the death of .Captain John Mercer, and the resignation 
of Captain Savage, and they should either be given to 
field-officers, or to the oldest lieutenants. No advantage can possibly arise to the field-officers from having 
companies, since they are allowed, I suppose, the same 
pay now, as they would receive in such a case. 
</p><p>
Two hundred and forty -six drafts are the total 
number brought in. Of these several have deserted. 
Three were discharged, being quite unfit for service, 
(and indeed several more ought to be discharged, if men 
were not so scarce,) and there remain now in confinement six Quakers, who will neither bear arms, work, 
receive provisions or pay, nor do any thing that tends, in 
any respect, to self-defence. I should be glad of your 
directions how to proceed with them. I cannot yet return to you the names of the volunteers, that will be appointed to the vacancies, but as soon as I arrive at Fort 
Cumberland I shall acquaint you according to request. 
</p><p>
Governor Sharpe is building a fort on Potomac River, 
about fifteen miles above Conococheague, which may be 
of great service towards the protection of our people on 
that side. It is thought the fort will cost the province 
of Maryland near thirty thousand pounds, before it is 
finished. I am, &,c.
