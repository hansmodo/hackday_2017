TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 9 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Colonel Byrd, with eight companies of his regiment, 
arrived here yesterday. He left many sick men behind, and, as he posted a company at Edwards's and 
Pearsall's, our strength is considerably reduced. 
</p><p>
Captain Dagworthy informed me, that Governor 
Sharpe is to open the road to Town Creek, within fifteen miles of this place, and, as Maryland has nearly 
two hundred men here fit for duty, I hope you will be 
of opinion, that they are sufficiently strong to proceed 
on the Fort Frederic road, without needing a reinforcement from us ; especially if you will consider, that they 
are in a manner covered by the troops here, and by 
those to be employed on the road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, to 
which service I shall send a detachment to-morrow. 
We have no hay at this place ; it was corn, which I 
called forage. We shall have tools enough to open the 
road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, among the artificers of Colonel Byrd's 
regiment. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear that the Catawbas have so egregiously misbehaved. When I write to Governor Fauquier, I shall touch on this subject.
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to find, that you approve the dress I have put my men into. It is evident, that soldiers in that trim are better able to carry their provisions^ are fitter for the active service we must engage in, less liable to sink under the fatigues of a march, and 
we thus get rid of much baggage, which would lengthen our line of march. These, and not whim or caprice, were my reasons for ordering this dress. I am, &,c. 
</p>
