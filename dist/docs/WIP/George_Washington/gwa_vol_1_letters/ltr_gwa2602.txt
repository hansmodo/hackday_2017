<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 20 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter by Mr. Stewart, enclosing a lieutenant-colonel's commission, and I hope 
my future behaviour will sufficiently testify the true sense I have of this kindness.
</p><p>
At present there are about seventy-five men at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, near fifty of whom I have enlisted. The 
others have been sent by Messrs. Poison, Mercer, and 
Waggener to this place. Very few officers have repaired hither yet, which has occasioned a fatiguing time 
to me, in managing a number of self-willed, ungovernable people. I shall implicitly obey your commands, 
and march out with all expedition. Major Carlyle is 
now preparing wagons for the conveyance of provisions, 
which till now could not move, on account of the heavy 
roads. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor has been informed before 
this of Mr. Vanbraam's ill success in Augusta, by the 
express, who was sent from thence for that purpose. 
</p><p>
Major Muse's promotion, and Messrs. Rose and 
Bently's declining, will occasion a w r ant of officers ; in 
which case I would beg leave to mention Mr. Vanbraam for a command, who is the oldest lieutenant, 
and an experienced soldier. Unless the officers come 
in, I shall be obliged to appoint him to that office, till I 
have your Honor's further directions. It would be conferring a very great obligation on him, were you to 
confirm the appointment. I verily believe his behaviour 
would not render him displeasing to you. I have given 
Captain Stephen orders to be in readiness to join us at 
Winchester with his company, as they were already in 
that neighbourhood, and raised there. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to add at present, but my sincere thanks for the indulgent favors I have met with, 
and I am your Honor's most obedient, &c.  
</p>
