TO COLONEL STANWIX. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 20 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 18th from the camp at Carlisle I received about noon this day, when, in company with his 
Majesty's agent for Indian affairs, I was examining the 
French prisoner brought to this place by Lieutenant 
Baker and the Cherokee Indian. A copy of this examination I herewith enclose. You will find, Sir, from 
the tenor of his answers, that a large body of Indians 
was hourly expected at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, and that, although there was not (if his intelligence is to be literally 
credited, and surely it is not) a train of artillery fit for 
such an expedition ; yet this might have been brought 
by those three hundred men, who arrived there after he 
left the place. 
</p><p>
It is altogether evident, if the Indian accounts may be 
relied on, that the French are bringing howitzers with 
them for the easier reduction of the place, if they should 
attack us. For, say they, your guns are but muskets, 
compared with those the French have with them. 
Theirs will admit a fawn in the muzzle, while yours will 
not take in a man's fist. To any person, in the least 
degree acquainted with the mountainous country about 
our settlements, it is clear, that the French can bring 
artillery along no other road, than that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, without spending immense 
time in mending one. I conceive that the garrison at 
Fort Augusta has been very negligent and inactive, not to discover the enemy sooner. On the other hand, a 
blazed path in the eyes of an Indian is a large road ; for 
he does not distinguish, without a close inspection, between a track which will admit of carriages, and a road 
sufficient for Indians to march in. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are only my own sentiments, and I submit them to your better judgment. We very well 
know, that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> 
there is a plain road already made, and bridges also. I 
shall, however, continue to pursue every means in my 
power to gain the earliest and best intelligence of the 
approaches of the enemy, and shall transmit it forthwith to you. I have sent Major Lewis fifty miles in 
advance of this place, with orders to keep out constant 
spies for intelligence, and to lose no time in forwarding 
it to me. 
</p><p>
We have received nothing new from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> since the 16th. The Indians, who brought the 
first news, imagine, that some of Spotswood's party are 
yet watching the motions of the enemy. On the contrary, I apprehend they are all cut off; for a man, who 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> the 16th, says, that the woods 
appear to be quite alive with hostile Indians, who show 
themselves openly in the day. This is unusual with 
them, unless they are strong. 
</p><p>
We work on this Fort, both night and day, intending 
to make it tenable against the worst event. Mr. Croghan and others write you by this express, and will no 
doubt be more explicit on Indian affairs, than I can pretend to be, and to them I refer. I am, &,c.
