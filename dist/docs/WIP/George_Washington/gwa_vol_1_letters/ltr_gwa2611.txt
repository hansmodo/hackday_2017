<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
Camp at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 29 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In answering your letter by Mr. Birney, I shall begin 
with assuring you, that nothing was farther from my 
intentions than to recede, though I then pressed, and still desire, that my services may be voluntary, rather 
than on the present pay. I am much concerned, that 
you should seem to charge me with ingratitude for your 
generous, though undeserved favors ; for I assure you, 
Sir, nothing is more a stranger to my breast, or a sin 
that my soul more abhors, than that black and detestable one of ingratitude. I retain a true sense of your 
kindness, and want nothing but opportunity to give my 
testimony of willingness to oblige you, as far as my life 
or fortune will extend. 
</p><p>
I could not object to the pay before I knew it. I 
dare say you remember, that the amount allowed by the 
first estimate to a lieutenant-colonel was fifteen shillings, 
and to a major twelve shillings and sixpence, of which I 
then complained very much, till your Honor assured me 
that we were to be furnished with proper necessaries, 
and offered that as a reason why the pay was less than 
that of British officers. After this, when you were so 
kind as to prefer me to the command I now hold, and 
at the same time informed me, that I was to have but 
twelve shillings and sixpence, after this, influenced also by 
some other reasons, I was induced to acquaint Colonel 
Fairfax with my intention of resigning, which he must 
well remember, as it happened at Bellhaven ; and it was 
there that he dissuaded me from it, and promised to 
represent the trifling pay to you, who would endeavour 
(as I at the same time told him that the Speaker thought 
the officers' pay too small) to have it enlarged. 
</p><p>
As to the numbers that applied for commissions, and 
to whom we were preferred, I believe, had those gentlemen been as TV ell acquainted with this country, and 
as sensible of the difficulties that would attend a campaign here as I then was, that your Honor would not 
have been so troublesomely solicited as you were. Yet 
I do not offer this as a reason for quitting the service. 
</p><p>
For my own part I can answer, that I have a constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most 
severe trials, and, I flatter myself, resolution to face 
what any man dares, as shall be proved when it comes 
to the test, which I believe we are upon the borders of. 
</p><p>
There is nothing, Sir, I believe, more certain, than 
that the officers in the Canada expedition had British 
pay allowed, while they were in the service. Lieutenant Waggener, Captain Trent, and several others, 
whom I have conversed with on that head, and who 
were engaged in that expedition, affirm it for truth. 
Therefore, Sir, as this cannot be allowed, suffer me to 
serve as a volunteer, which, I assure you, will be the 
next reward to British pay; for, as my services, so far as 
I have knowledge, shall equal those of the best officer, 
I make it a point of honor not to serve for less, or accept 
a medium. 
</p><p>
Nevertheless, I have communicated your sentiments 
to the other officers, and, as far as I could put on the 
hypocrite, set forth the advantages that may accrue, and 
advised them to accept the terms, as a refusal might 
reflect dishonor upon their character, leaving it to the 
world to assign what reason it pleases for their quitting 
the service. I am very sensible of the pernicious consequences that will attend their resigning, as they have 
gained some experience of the military art, have a 
tolerable knowledge of the country, having been most 
of them sent out at different times with parties, and are 
now accustomed to the hardships and fatigues of living 
as we do, which, I think, were it truly stated, would 
prevent your Honor from many troublesome solicitations 
from others for commissions. This last motive has 
induced and will induce me to do what I can to reconcile matters, though I really believe there are some, who 
will not remain long without an alteration. They have 
promised to consider it, and give you an answer. I 
was not ignorant of the allowance, which Colonel Fry 
has for his table ; but, being a dependent there myself, I 
am deprived of the pleasure of inviting an officer, or 
friend, which to me would be more agreeable, than any 
benefits I shall meet with there. 
</p><p>
And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more 
in your letter on this head, which, too, is more fully 
expressed in a paragraph of Colonel Fairfax's letter to 
me, as follows; "If, on the British establishment, 
officers are allowed more pay, the regimentals they are 
obliged annually to furnish, and their necessary table 
and other incidental expenses, being considered, little 
or no savings will be their portion." 
</p><p>
I believe it is well known, that we have been at the 
expense of regimentals, and it is still better known, that 
regimentals, and every other necessary, which we were 
under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this 
expedition, were not to be bought for less in Virginia currency, than they would cost British officers in sterling 
money ; which ought to have been the case, to put us 
upon a parity in this respect. Then Colonel Fairfax 
observes, that their table and other incidental charges 
prevent them from saving much. They have the enjoyment of their pay, which we neither have in one sense 
nor the other. We are debarred the pleasure of good 
living ; and, Sir, I dare say you will acknowledge, that, 
with one who has always been used to it, it must go 
somewhat hard to be confined to a little salt provision 
and water, and to do duty, hard, laborious duty, which is 
almost inconsistent with that of a soldier, and yet have 
the same reductions as if he were allowed luxuriously. 
My pay, according to the British establishment and 
common exchange, Avould be near twenty shillings per 
day ; in the room of which, the Committee (for I cannot 
in the least imagine your Honor had any hand in it) has 
provided twelve shillings and sixpence, so long as the 
service continues, whereas one half of the other is confirmed to British officers for life. Now if we should 
be fortunate enough to drive the French from the Ohio, 
as far as your Honor would please to have them sent, in 
any short time, our pay will not be sufficient to discharge 
our first expenses. 
</p><p>
I would not have you imagine from this, that I have 
said all these things to have the pay increased, but to 
justify myself, and show you that our complaints are not 
frivolous, but founded upon strict reason. For my own 
part, it is a matter almost indifferent whether I serve for 
full pay, or as a generous volunteer; indeed, did my 
circumstances correspond with my inclinations, I should 
not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter ; for the 
motives that have led me here are pure and noble ; I 
had no view of acquisition, but that of honor, by serving 
faithfully my king and country. 
</p><p>
As you have t recommended Mr. Willis, you may 
depend I shall with pleasure do all I can for him. 
But above all, Sir, you may rely, that I shall take 
all possible means of procuring intelligence, and guarding against surprises; and be assured nothing but 
very unequal numbers shall compel me to submit or retreat. 
</p><p>
Now, Sir, as I have answered your letter, I shall beg 
leave to acquaint you with what has happened since I 
wrote by Mr. Gist. I then informed you, that I had 
detached a party of seventy-five men to meet fifty of 
the French, who, we had intelligence, were upon their 
march towards us. About nine o'clock the same night 
I received an express from the Half-King, who w? 
encamped with several of his people about six miles off, 
that he had seen the tracks of two Frenchmen crossing 
the road, and that, behind, the whole body were lying 
not far off, as he had an account of that number passing 
Mr. Gist's. 
</p><p>
I set out with forty men before ten, and it was from 
that time till near sunrise before we reached the Indians' 
camp, having marched in small paths, through a heavy 
rain, and a night as dark as it is possible to conceive. 
We were frequently tumbling one over another, and 
often so lost, that fifteen or twenty minutes' search 
would not find the path again. 
</p><p>
When we came to the Half- King, I counselled with 
him, and got his assent to go hand-in-hand and strike 
the French. Accordingly, he, Monacawacha, and a few 
other Indians set out with us ; and when we came to the 
place where the tracks were, the Half-King sent two 
Indians to follow their tracks, and discover their lodgement, which they did at half a mile from the road, in a 
very obscure place surrounded with rocks. I thereupon, 
in conjunction with the Half-King and Monacawacha, 
formed a disposition to attack them on all sides, which 
we accordingly did, and, after an engagement of about 
fifteen minutes, we killed ten, wounded one, and took 
twenty -one prisoners. Amongst those killed was M. de 
Jumonville, the commander. The principal officers taken are M. Drouillon and M. La Force, of whom your 
Honor has often heard me speak, as a bold enterprising 
man, and a person of great subtlety and cunning. With 
these are two cadets. 
</p><p>
These officers pretend they were coming on an embassy; but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring, as 
you will see by the Instructions and Summons enclosed. 
Their instructions were to reconnoitre ^the country, 
roads, creeks, and the like, as far as the Potomac, which 
they were about to do. These enterprising men weie 
purposely chosen out to procure intelligence, which they 
were to send back by some brisk despatches, with the 
mention of the day that they were to serve the summons ; which could be with no other view, than to get 
a sufficient reinforcement to fall upon us immediately 
after. This, with several other reasons, induced all the 
officers to believe firmly, that they were sent as spies, 
rather than any thing else, and has occasioned my 
detaining them as prisoners, though they expected, or 
at least had some faint hope, that they should be continued as ambassadors. 
</p><p>
They, finding where we were encamped, instead of 
coming up in a public manner, sought out one of the 
most secret retirements, fitter for a deserter than an 
ambassador to encamp in, and stayed there two or three 
days, sending spies to reconnoitre our camp, as we are 
told, though they deny it. Their whole body moved 
back near two miles, and they sent off two runners to 
acquaint Contrecoeur with our strength, and where we 
were encamped. Now thirty-six men would almost 
have been a retinue for a princely ambassador, instead 
of a petit. Why did they, if their designs were open, 
stay so long within five miles of us, without delivering 
their message, or acquainting me with it ? Their waiting could be with no other design, than to get detachments to enforce the summons, as soon as it was given. 
They had no occasion to send out spies, for the name 
of an ambassador is sacred among all nations; but it 
was by the track of those spies, that they were discovered, and that we got intelligence of them. They 
would not have retired two miles back without delivering the summons, and sought a skulking-place (which, 
to do them justice, was done with great judgment), but 
for some special reason. Besides, the summons is so 
insolent, and savors so much of gasconade, that if two 
men only had come to deliver it openly, it would have 
been too great an indulgence to send them back.
</p><p>
The sense of the Half-King on this subject is, that 
they have bad hearts, and that this is a mere pretence ; 
that they never designed to come to us but in a hostile 
manner, and if we were so foolish as to let them go 
again, he never would assist us in taking another of 
them. Besides, La Force would, if released, I really 
think, do more to our disservice, than fifty other men, 
as he is a person whose active spirit leads him into all 
parties, and has brought him acquainted with all parts 
of the country. Add to this a perfect use of the Indian 
tongue, and great influence with the Indians. He ingenuously enough confessed, that, as soon as he saw 
the commission and instructions, he believed, and then 
said he expected some such tendency, though he pretends to say he does not believe the commander had 
any other than a good design. 
</p><p>
In this engagement we had only one man killed and two or three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant 
Waggener slightly, a most miraculous escape, as our right wing was much exposed to their fire and received it alLf 
</p><p>
The Half-King received your Honor's speech very 
kindly, but desired me to inform you, that he could not 
leave his people at this time, thinking them in great 
danger. He is now gone to the Crossing for their families, to bring them to our camp ; and he desired I would 
furnish some men and horses to assist them up, which I 
have accordingly done. I have sent thirty men and upwards of twenty horses. He says, if your Honor has 
any thing to say, you may communicate it by me, and 
that, if you have a present for them, it may be kept till 
another occasion, after sending out some things for their 
immediate use. He has declared that he will send these 
Frenchmen's scalps, with a hatchet, to all the nations of 
Indians in union with them, and did that very day give a 
hatchet, and a large belt of wampum, to a Delaware man 
to carry to Shingiss. He promised me to send down the 
river for all the Mingoesf and Shawanees to our camp, 
where I expect him to-morrow with thirty or forty men, 
and their wives and children, to" confirm what he has 
said here. He has sent your Honor a string of wampum. 
</p><p>
As these runners went off to the fort on Sunday last, 
I shall expect every hour to be attacked, and by unequal numbers, which I must withstand if there are five 
to one; for I fear the consequence will be, that we shall 
lose the Indians, if we suffer ourselves to be driven 
back. I despatched an express immediately to Colonel 
Fry with this intelligence, desiring him to send me reinforcements with all imaginable speed. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may depend I will not be surprised, let 
them come at what hour they will ; and this is as much 
as I can promise. But my best endeavours shall not 
be wanting to effect more. I doubt not, if you hear 
I am beaten, but you will hear at the same time, that 
we have done our duty, in fighting as long as there was 
a shadow of hope. 
</p><p>
I have sent Lieutenant West, accompanied by Mr. Spiltdorph and a guard of twenty men, to conduct the 
prisoners in, and I believe the officers have told him 
what answer to return to you. 
</p><p>
Monsieur La Force and Major Drouillon beg to be 
recommended to your notice, and I have promised that 
they shall meet with all the favor due to prisoners of 
war. I have shown all the respect I could to them 
here, and have given them some necessary clothing, by 
which I have disfurnished myself; for, having brought no 
more than two or three shirts from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, that 
we might be light, I was ill provided to supply them. 
I am, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have neither seen nor heard any particular account of the Twigtwees since I came on these waters.
We have already begun a palisadoed fort, and hope to have it up to-morrow. I must beg leave to acquaint 
you, that Captain Vanbraam and Ensign Peyrouny have behaved extremely well since they came out, and I 
hope they will meet with your favor, t
