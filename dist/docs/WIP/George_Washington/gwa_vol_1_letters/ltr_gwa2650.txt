TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES, VIRGINIA.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I received yours by Mr. Kirkpatrick, and 
am sorry to hear of the reflections upon the conduct of 
the officers. I could wish that their names had been 
particularized, that justice might be done to the innocent and guilty ; for it is extremely hard, that the whole 
corps should suffer reproaches for the inadvertence and 
misconduct of a few.
</p><p>
The deplorable situation of this people is no more to 
be described, than my anxiety and uneasiness for their 
relief. You may expect, by the time this comes to 
hand, that, without a considerable reinforcement, Frederic county will not be mistress of fifteen families. 
They are now retreating to the securest parts in droves 
of fifties. In short, every thing has too melancholy an 
appearance for pen to communicate. I have therefore 
sent an officer, whose good sense and judicious observations will be a more effectual way of transmitting an 
account of the people's distresses. 
</p><p>
I wish the Assembly had given two thousand, instead 
of fifteen hundred men, and that I had been acquainted 
with the dispositions they intended to make. Since I 
am ignorant of these, I hope it will not be thought presuming in me to offer my sentiments upon the subject. 
</p><p>
We are, Sir, first to consider, that, if a chain of forts is to be erected upon our frontiers, it will be done with 
a design to protect the people ; therefore, if these forts are more than fifteen or eighteen miles, or a day's march, 
asunder, and garrisoned with less than eighty or a hundred men each, the object is not answered, and for these 
reasons. First, if they are at greater distances, it will 
be inconvenient for the soldiers to scout, and will allow 
the enemy to pass between undiscovered. Secondly if 
they are garrisoned with less than eighty or a hundred 
men, the number will be too few to afford detachments. 
Then, again, our frontiers are so extensive, that, were 
the enemy to attack us on the one side, they might, before the troops on the other could reach the spot, overrun and destroy half the country. And it is mere than 
probable, if they had a design in one direction, they 
would make a feint in another. We are also to consider 
what sums the building of twenty forts, and the removing of stores and provisions to each, would cost. In the 
last place, we are to inquire where and when this expense will end. For, unless we endeavour to remove 
the cause, we shall be liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now, if the war continues, and the 
enemy is allowed to remain on the Ohio. 
</p><p>
I shall next give the reasons, which I think make for 
a defensive plan. If the neighbouring colonies refuse 
us their assistance, we have neither strength nor ability 
to conduct an expedition ; and, if we had, and were the 
whole to join us, I do not see to what purpose, since we 
have neither a train of artillery, artillery -men, nor engineers to execute any scheme beyond the mountains 
against a regular fortress. Again, we have neither 
stores nor provisions, arms nor ammunition, wagons nor 
horses, in any degree proportioned to the service ; and 
to undertake an affair, where we are sure to fall through, 
would be productive of the worst consequences. By 
another defeat we should entirely lose the interest of every Indian. 
</p><p>
If, then, we cannot act offensively with a prospect of 
success, we must be upon the defensive ; and that there 
is no way to protect the people, or save ourselves, but 
by a chain of forts, is certain. 
</p><p>
I would beg leave, in that case, to propose that a 
strong fort should be erected at this place, for a general 
receptacle of all the stores, and a place of residence for 
the commanding officers, which may be garrisoned by 
one company for the security of the stores, serving also 
as escorts for wagons, that are going higher up. It is 
the most public and convenient post for intelligence of 
any in the country, and approaches nearest to the parts, 
that will ever be attacked by numbers. 
</p><p>
I have found by experience, that being just within 
the inhabitants is essential, in giving orders for the defence of the people ; and that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is of no 
more use towards that defence, than Fort George at 
Hampton. For the people, as soon as they are alarmed, 
immediately fly inwards, and at this time there is not an 
inhabitant living between this place and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, except a few settlements upon the Manor around 
a fort we built there, and a few families at Edwards's, on 
Cacapehon River, with a guard of ours, which makes 
this very town at present the outermost frontier. Though 
a place trifling in itself, it is yet of the utmost importance, as it commands the communication from east to 
west, and from nortfy to south. At this place almost 
all the roads centre. It secures the great roads from 
one half our frontiers to the markets of the neighbouring 
colonies, as well as to those on Rappahannoc and Potomac. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> I would have one company 
garrisoned to secure the place, to procure the earliest 
intelligence, and to cover the detachments that may be 
sent towards the Ohio, which is all the use it can ever 
be put to. In the next place, I would propose, that a good fort should be erected between this and Fort 
Cumberland, in a line with the chain of forts across the 
country, and garrisoned by two companies. This I 
would advise, because, as I before observed, if we are 
ever attacked by a large body, it must be here, since 
there is no other road to our frontiers, either for transporting men or necessaries. 
</p><p>
These three forts will employ four companies, which 
will be a tolerable body, if the companies are large, as 
they would be, according to the plan I sent you. And 
it would be a trifling expense to augment each company 
to one hundred privates, making two thousand, exclusive of officers, who were included in the scheme last 
sent. 
</p><p>
After this is done, I would post the remaining companies equidistant, or at proper passes, along our frontiers, agreeably to the enclosed sketch, and order 
communications to be opened between fort and fort, and 
large detachments to scout and discover the tracks of 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
It needs now only to be inquired, upon what part of our 
frontiers these forts are to be built. The Great Ridge, 
or North Mountain, so called in Evans's map, to which 
I refer, is now become our exterior bound, there not 
being one inhabitant beyond, on all the Potomac waters, 
except a few families on the South Branch, and at 
Joseph Edwards's, on Cacapehon, as already mentioned. 
So that it requires some consideration to determine 
whether we are to build near this place, with a view to 
protect the present inhabitants ; or on the South Branch> 
or at Patterson's Creek, in the hope of drawing back 
those, who have forsaken their dwellings. 
</p><p>
If we do not build there, that country will ever want 
settlers ; and if we do, there is so great a blank, with 
such a series of mountains between, that it will be next to impossible to guard the people effectually. I could 
again wish, that the Assembly had given two thousand 
men, exclusive of officers, to be formed into two battalions of ten companies each. Indeed, fifteen hundred 
men are a greater number than ever was in a regiment 
of only one battalion, and they should be divided into 
two, with four field-officers, who should be so posted as 
to have the immediate care of a certain number of forts, 
with orders to draw from one to another, as occasion 
should require.
</p><p>
I could add more on this subject, but I am so hurried, 
that I am obliged to refer you for further particulars to 
the bearer, who will tell you, that, to carry on all these 
works, a number of tools, as well as many other necessaries, will be wanting. 
</p><p>
I have given my opinion with candor, and submit to 
correction with the greatest pleasure. Confusion and 
hurry must be an apology for the incoherence and 
incorrectness of this letter. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, yours, &c.
