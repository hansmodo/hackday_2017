<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 17 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
A letter of the 22d ultimo, from Captain Peachey, 
came to my hands the other day, the contents of which 
are herewith forwarded. I should take it infinitely 
kind, if your Honor would please to inform me, whether 
a report of this nature was ever made to you ; and, in 
that case, who was the author of it ? 
</p><p>
It is evident, from a variety of circumstances, and especially from the change in your Honor's conduct towards me, that some person, as well inclined to detract, 
but better skilled in the art of detraction, than the author of the above stupid scandal, has made free with my 
character. For I cannot suppose, that malice so absurd, so barefaced, so diametrically opposite to truth, to 
common policy, and, in short, to every thing but villany, as the above is, could impress you with so ill an opinion of my honor and honesty. 
</p><p>
If it be possible, that Colonel C., for my belief is 
staggered, not being conscious of having given the least 
cause to any one, much less to that gentlemen, to reflect 
so grossly, I say, if it be possible, that Colonel C. 
could descend so low as to be the propagator of this 
story, he must either be vastly ignorant of the state of 
affairs in this county at that time, or else he must 
suppose, that the whole body of inhabitants had combined with me, in executing the fraud. Or why did 
they, almost to a man, forsake their dwellings in the 
greatest terror and confusion ; so that, while one half of 
them sought shelter in paltry forts, of their own building, the other fled to the adjacent counties for refuge, 
numbers of them even to Carolina, from whence they 
have never returned 1 
</p><p>
These are facts well known ; but not better known, 
than that these wretched people, while they lay pent up 
in forts, destitute of the common support of life (having 
in their precipitate flight forgotten, or rather been unable to secure, any kind of necessaries), did despatch 
messengers of their own (thinking I had not represented 
their miseries in the piteous manner they deserved), 
with addresses to your Honor and the Assembly, praying relief. And did I ever send any alarming account, 
without also sending the original papers, or the copies, 
which gave rise to it? 
</p><p>
That I have foibles, and perhaps many of them, I shall 
not deny. I should esteem myself, as the world also 
would, vain and empty, were I to arrogate perfection. 
</p><p>
Knowledge in military matters is to be acquired by 
practice and experience only ; and, if I have erred, great 
allowance should be made for the want of them ; unless 
my errors should appear to be wilful ; and then, I conceive, it would be more generous to charge me with my 
faults, and let me stand or fall according to evidence, 
than to stigmatize me behind my back. 
</p><p>
It is uncertain in what light my services may have 
appeared to your Honor ; but this I know, and it is the 
highest consolation I am capable of feeling, that no man, 
that ever was employed in a public capacity, has endeavoured to discharge the trust reposed in him with 
greater honesty, and more zeal for the country's interest, than I have done ; and if there is any person living, 
who can say with justice, that I have offered any intentional wrong to the public, I will cheerfully submit to the 
most ignominious punishment, that an injured people 
ought to inflict. On the other hand, it is hard to have 
my character arraigned, and my actions condemned, 
without a hearing. 
</p><p>
I must therefore again beg in more plain, and in very 
earnest terms, to know, if Colonel C. has taken the liberty of representing my character to your Honor with 
such ungentlemanly freedom as the letter implies ? 
Your condescension herein will be acknowledged, as a 
singular favor done your Honor's most obedient, humble 
servant. 
</p>
