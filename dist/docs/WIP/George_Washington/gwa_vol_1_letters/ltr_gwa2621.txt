<p>
TO WILLIAM FAIRFAX.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 23 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I cannot think of quitting Fairfax, without embracing 
this last opportunity of bidding you farewell. I shall 
this day set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, where I expect to 
meet the General, and to stay, I fear, too long, as the 
march must be regulated by the slow movements of the 
train ; which, I am sorry to say, will be tedious, very 
tedious indeed, as I have long predicted, though few 
believed. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> has been honored with five governors hi consultation ; a favorable presage, I hope, not 
only of the success of this expedition, but of the future 
greatness of that town ; for surely such a meeting must 
have been occasioned by the commodious and pleasant 
situation of the place, which prognosticates population, 
and increase of a flourishing trade. 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to be introduced to several governors, and of being well received by them ; especially 
Mr. Shirley, whose character and appearance have perfectly charmed me. I think his every word and action 
discover in him the gentleman and politician. I heartily 
wish the same unanimity may prevail among us, as 
appeared to exist between him and his Assembly, 
when they, to expedite the business, and to forward his 
journey hither, sat till eleven and twelve o'clock every 
night. 
</p><p>
It will be needless, as I know your punctuality requires no stimulus, to remind you of an affair, about 
which I wrote some time ago ; therefore I shall only beg 
my compliments to Mr. Nicholas and his lady, and to 
all friends who think me worthy of their inquiries. I 
am, &,c. 
</p>
