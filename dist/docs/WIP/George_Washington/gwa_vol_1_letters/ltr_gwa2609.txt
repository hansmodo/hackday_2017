SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 25th ultimo, by an express from Colonel Fry, 
I received the news of your arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and 
desire of seeing the Half-King and other chiefs of the 
Six Nations. I have by sundry speeches and messages 
invited him, Monacawacha, and others, to meet me, and 
have reason to expect the Half-King is on his way, as 
he only designed to settle his people to planting, at a 
place up the Monongahela chosen for that purpose. 
But fearing something might have retarded his march, 
I immediately, upon the arrival of the express, despatched a messenger with a speech. He is not yet 
returned. About four days ago I received a message from the Half- King to the following purport ; 
</p><p>
" To the first of his Majesty's officers, whom this may concern. 
</p><p>
" It is reported, that the French army is coming to 
meet Major George Washington. I exhort you, therefore, my brethren, to be on your guard against them, 
for they 'intend to strike the first English, whom they 
shall see. They have been on their march two days. 
I know not their number. The Half-King and the rest 
of the Chiefs will be with you in five days to hold a 
council. No more at present, but my remembrance to 
my brothers the English." 
</p><p>
His account was strengthened in the evening by 
another, that the French were at the Crossing of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a> about eighteen miles distant. I hereupon hurried to this place as a convenient spot. We have, with 
nature's assistance, made a good entrenchment, and, by 
clearing the bushes out of these meadows, prepared a 
charming field for an encounter. I detached, immediately upon my arrival here, a small light party of 
horse (wagon horses) to reconnoitre the enemy, and 
discover their strength and motion. They returned 
yesterday without having seen any thing of them; nevertheless, we were alarmed in the night, and remained 
under arms from two o'clock till near sunrise. We 
conceived them to be our own men, as six of them 
deserted, but cannot be certain whether it was they or 
our enemies. Be it as it will, they were fired at by my 
sentries, but I believe without damage. 
</p><p>
This morning Mr. Gist arrived from his place, where 
a detachment of fifty men was seen yesterday at noon, 
commanded by M. La Force. He afterwards saw their 
tracks within five miles of our camp. I immediately 
detached seventy-five men in pursuit of them, who, I 
hope, will overtake them before they get to Red-stone, 
where their canoes lie. As Mr. Gist has been an eyewitness of our proceedings, and is waiting for this without my knowing till just now that he intends to visit you, 
I refer you to him for particulars. I expect my messenger in to-night from the Half-King, and shall write 
more fully to-morrow by the express that came from 
Colonel Fry. 
</p><p>
The numbers of the French have been greatly magnified, as your Honor may see by a copy of the enclosed 
journal of a person, whom I sent out to gain intelligence. 
I have received letters from the Governors of Pennsylvania and Maryland, copies of which I also enclose. 
I am, &,c.
