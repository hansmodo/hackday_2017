SIR, 
</p><p>
It gave me infinite concern to find in yours by Governor Innes, that any representations should inflame the 
Assembly against the Virginia regiment, or give cause 
to suspect the morality and good behaviour of the officers. How far any of the individuals may have deserved 
such reflections, I will not take upon me to determine, 
but this I am certain of, and can call my conscience, and 
what, I suppose, will be a still more demonstrative proof 
in the eyes of the world, my orders, to witness how 
much I have, both by threats and persuasive means, endeavoured to discountenance gaming, drinking, swearing, 
and irregularities of every other kind ; while I have, on 
the other hand, practised every artifice to inspire a laudable emulation in the officers for the service of their 
country, and to encourage the soldiers in the unerring 
exercise of their duty. How far I have failed in this 
desirable end, I cannot pretend to say. But it is nevertheless a point, which does in my opinion merit some 
scrutiny, before it meets with a final condemnation. 
Yet I will not undertake to vouch for the conduct of 
many of the officers, as I know there are some, who 
have the seeds of idleness very strongly implanted in 
their natures ; and I also know, that the unhappy difference about the command, which has kept me from Fort 
Cumberland, has consequently prevented me from enforcing the orders, which I never failed to send. 
</p><p>
However, if I continue in the service, I shall take care 
to act with a little more rigor, than has hitherto been 
practised, since I find it so necessary. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Honor in my last how unsuccessfully we 
attempted to raise the militia, and that I was reduced to the necessity of waiting here for the arrival of an escort 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. The garrison there is barely manned. The rest are out on parties ; yet the Indians 
continue to haunt the roads, and pick up straggling persons. This you may see by the enclosed from Captain 
John Mercer, who, being out with a scouting party of one hundred men, has been ordered to search the 
Warm- Spring Mountain, where, it is lately reported, the Indians rendezvous. The commission you have sent 
for holding courts -martial is yet insufficient, as it is copied, I suppose, too literally after Governor Innes, who 
had no power to hold a general court-martial, or to try commissioned officers. But this may be postponed 
until I come down, which will be in a short time after I arrive at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I am your Honor's, &,c. 
</p>
