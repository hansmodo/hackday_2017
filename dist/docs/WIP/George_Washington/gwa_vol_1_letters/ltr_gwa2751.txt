DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
Mr. Smith delivered me your letter of the 16th instant, but as one is generally in a hurry and bustle in 
such places, and at such times, as these, I have only 
time to acknowledge it, and add, that it would have 
given me pleasure to meet you here. I shall refer you 
to Mr. Smith for an account of our proceedings up to 
this day, and you cannot fail of learning the rest from 
the 'Squire, who delights in the minutiae of a tale. I 
am in doubt whether we shall finish here this week; 
but as I shall delay little time on the road in returning, I 
shall hope to see you on your way up, or down, from 
Berkeley. I am much obliged to you for the hollyberries and cotton-seed. My love to my sister and the 
children. 
</p><p>
I had like to have forgotten to express my entire approbation of the laudable pursuit you are engaged in, of 
training an independent company. I have promised to 
review the independent company of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> some 
time this summer, they having made me a tender of the 
command of it. At the same time I could review yours, 
and shall very cheerfully accept the honor of commanding it, if occasion require it to be drawn out, as it is my 
full intention to devote my life and fortune in the cause 
we are engaged in, if needful, 
</p><p>
I remain, dear Sir, your most affectionate brother. 
</p>
