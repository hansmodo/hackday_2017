TO THE REVEREND JONATHAN BOUCHER.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From several concurring causes, which exist at this 
moment, at the eve of my departure for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, 
I have both my head and hands too full of business to 
allow me time to write more than a hasty letter. This, 
however, I shall attempt to do, in answer to yours of the 
4th instant. 
</p><p>
In my last I informed you, that the friends (I do not 
by this confine myself to the relations only) of Mr. Custis were divided in opinion, as to the propriety of his 
travelling, not because they thought advantages would 
not result from it, but on account of the expense, as he 
would commence his tour with the heavy charge, which 
you thought requisite to induce you to accompany him, 
and which would at once anticipate half his income. 
His estate is of that kind, which rather comes under the 
denomination of a large than a profitable one. This divided opinion was a sufficient cause, I observed in my 
last, for me to be circumspect in my conduct, as I am 
accountable to another tribunal, besides that in my own 
breast, for the part I am to act on this occasion. You 
cannot but know, that every farthing, expended in behalf of this young gentleman, must undergo the inspection of the General Court, in their examination of my 
guardianship accounts, and that it would be imprudent 
in me to permit him to launch into any uncommon or 
extravagant course, especially at a time when a heavy 
and expensive chancery suit is instituted against his estate, without first knowing whether such a charge would 
be approved by those, who have a constitutional right to 
judge of the expediency or propriety of the measure. 
</p><p>
These are the reasons why I said in my last letter, 
that my own inclinations were still as strong as ever for 
Mr. Custis's pursuing his travelling scheme, provided 
the Court should approve of the expense, and provided, 
also, that it should appear, when his judgment was a 
little more matured, that he was desirous of undertaking 
this tour upon a plan of improvement, rather than a 
vague desire of gratifying an idle curiosity, or spending 
his money. If his mother does not speak her own sentiments, rather than his, he is lukewarm in the scheme ; 
and I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that his education, from what I have understood of his improvement, 
however advanced it may be for a youth of his age, is 
by no means ripe enough for a travelling tour. Not 
that I think his becoming a mere scholar is a desirable 
education for a gentleman, but I conceive a knowledge 
of books is the basis upon which other knowledge is to 
be built, and in travelling he is to become acquainted 
with men and things rather than books. At present, 
however well versed he may be in the principles of the 
Latin language (which is not to be wondered at, as he began the study of it as soon as he could speak), he is 
unacquainted with several of the classical authors, that 
might be useful to him. He is ignorant of Greek, the 
advantages of learning which I do not pretend to judge 
of, and he knows nothing of French, which is absolutely 
necessary to him as a traveller. He has little or no acquaintance with arithmetic, and is totally ignorant of the 
mathematics, than which, at least so much of them as 
relates to surveying, nothing can be more essentially 
necessary to any man possessed of a large landed estate, the bounds of some part or other of which are 
always in controversy. 
</p><p>
Now, whether he has time between this and next 
spring to acquire a sufficient knowledge of these studies, 
or so much of them as is requisite, I leave you to judge ; 
as also whether a boy of seventeen years old, which will 
be his age next November, can have any just notions of 
the end and design of travelling. I have already given 
it as my opinion, that it would be precipitating this 
event, unless he were to go immediately to the university for a couple of years, in which case he could see 
nothing of America ; which might be a disadvantage to 
him, as it is to be expected that every man, who travels 
with a view of observing the laws and customs of other 
countries, should be able to give some description of the 
situation and government of his own. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, it is impossible for me at this time to 
give a more decisive answer, however strongly inclined 
I may be to put you upon a certainty in this affair, than 
I have done ; and I should think myself wanting in candor, if I concealed any circumstance from you, which 
leads me to fear, that there is a possibility, if not a probability, that the whole design may be totally defeated. 
Before I ever thought myself at liberty to encourage 
this plan, I judged it highly reasonable and necessary, that his mother should be consulted. I laid your first 
letter and proposals before her, and desired that she 
would reflect well, before she resolved, as an unsteady 
behaviour might be a disadvantage to you. Her determination was, that, if it appeared to be his inclination to 
undertake this tour, and it should be judged for his benefit, she would not oppose it, whatever pangs it might 
give her to part with him. To this declaration she still 
adheres, but in so faint a manner, that I think, with her 
fears and his indifference, it will soon be declared he 
has no inclination to go. I do not say that this will be 
the case. I cannot speak positively ; but as this is the 
result of my own reflections upon the matter, I thought it but fair to communicate it to you. 
</p><p>
Several causes, I believe, have concurred to make 
her view his departure, as the time approaches, with 
more reluctance than she expected. The unhappy situation of her daughter has in some degree fixed her 
eyes upon him as her only hope. To what I have already said, I can only add, that my warmest wishes are 
to see him prosecute a plan, at a proper period, which I 
may be sure will redound to his advantage, and that 
nothing shall be wanting on my part to aid and assist 
him. In the event of his going, I should think myself 
highly favored, and him much honored, by Governor 
Eden's letters of introduction. Such letters, with others 
that might be procured, could not fail of having their 
advantages. 
</p><p>
You will please to make my compliments to Mr. Dulany, and assure him, that I have not the vestige of a 
house at the Frederic Springs, otherwise it should have 
been, if unengaged, much at his service. The two seasons I spent there I occupied a house of Mr. Mercer's. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
