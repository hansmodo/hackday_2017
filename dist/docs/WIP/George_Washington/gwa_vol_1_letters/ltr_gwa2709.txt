TO GENERAL FORBES. 
</p><p>
Camp, on Chestnut Ridge, 11 o'clock at night, 15 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
An express from Colonel Armstrong affords me an 
opportunity of informing you, that we arrived here about 
four o'clock this afternoon. I immediately ordered working parties on the road, that no time might be lost in 
working it ; but I fear I shall not proceed so fast as you 
could wish, since, after all my delays, and waiting for 
tools, Captain Fields was able to get but forty-two axes. 
These, and the others that are here, shall be employed 
to-morrow at daylight to the best advantage. The road 
intended is but very slightly blazed. It may be necessary to send Captain Shelby forward to prevent mistakes. 
</p><p>
This camp is about six miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, 
where the new road strikes out. I am, &c. 
</p>
