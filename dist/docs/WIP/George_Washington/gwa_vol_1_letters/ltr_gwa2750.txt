SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 8th, which is just handed to me, could not have given you more pain in writing, than it 
has given me in reading, because I never deny or even 
hesitate in granting any request, that is made to me, especially by persons I esteem, and in matters of moment, 
without feeling inexpressible uneasiness. I do not wonder at your solicitude on account of your only son. The 
nurturing and bringing him up in a proper course is, no 
doubt, an object of great concern to you, as well as importance to him ; but two things are essentially necessary in the man to whom this charge is committed, a 
capacity of judging w r ith propriety of measures proper 
to be taken in the government of a youth, and leisure 
sufficient to attend to the execution of these measures. 
That you are pleased to think favorably of me, in respect to the first, I shall take for granted, from the request you have made ; but to show my incapacity of 
attending to the latter, with that good faith, which I 
think every man ought to use, who undertakes a trust of 
this interesting nature, I can solemnly declare to yon, 
that, for a year or two past, there has been scarce a 
moment, that I could properly call my own. What with 
my own business, my present ward's, my mother's, 
which is wholly in my hands, Colonel Colvill's, Mrs. 
Savage's, Colonel Fairfax's, Colonel Mercer's, and the 
little assistance I have undertaken to give in the management of my brother Augustine's concerns (for I have 
absolutely refused to qualify as an executor), together 
with the share I take in public affairs, I have been kept 
constantly engaged in writing letters, settling accounts, 
and negotiating one piece of business or another; by 
which means I have really been deprived of every kind 
of enjoyment, and had almost fully resolved to engage 
in no fresh matter, till I had entirely wound up the old. 
</p><p>
Thus much, Sir, candor, indeed the principle of common honesty, obliged me to relate to you, as it is not my 
wish to deceive any person by promising what I do not 
think it in my power to perform with that punctuality and 
rectitude, which I conceive the nature of the trust would 
require. I do not, however, give a flat refusal to your 
request. I rather wish you to be fully informed of my 
situation, that you may think with me, or as I do, that, 
if it should please the Almighty to take you to himself 
so soon as you apprehend (but I hope without just 
cause), your son may be placed in better hands than 
mine. If you think otherwise, I will do the best I can, merely as a guardian. 
</p><p>
You. will act very prudently in having your will revised by some person skilled in the law, as a testator's 
intentions are often defeated by different interpretations 
of statutes, which require the whole business of a man's 
life to be perfectly conversant with them. I shall not, 
after what I have here said, add any thing more than my 
wishes, which are sincerely offered, for your recovery, 
and that you may live to see the accomplishment of 
your son's education. With very great esteem, Sir, 
I am your most obedient humble servant. 
</p>
