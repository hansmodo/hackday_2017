DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
John has just delivered to me your favor of yesterday, which I shall be obliged to answer in a more 
concise manner, than I could wish, as I am very much 
engaged in raising one of the additions to my house, 
which I think (perhaps it is fancy) goes on better whilst 
I am present, than in my absence from the workmen. 
</p><p>
I own to you, Sir, I wished much to hear of your 
making an open declaration of taking a poll for this 
county, upon Colonel West's publicly declining last 
Sunday ; and I should have written to you on the subject, but for information then received from several gentlemen in the churchyard, of your having refused to do 
so, for the reasons assigned in your letter;! upon which, 
as I think the country never stood more in need of men 
of abilities and liberal sentiments than now, I entreated 
several gentlemen at our church yesterday to press 
Colonel Mason to take a poll, as I really think Major 
Broad water, though a good man, might do as well in the 
discharge of his domestic concerns, as in the capacity of a legislator. And therefore I again express my wish, 
that nither you or Colonel Mason would offer. I can 
be of little assistance to either, because I early laid it 
dow r n as a maxim not to propose myself, and solicit for a 
second. 
</p><p>
As to your political sentiments, I would heartily join 
you in them, so far as relates to a humble and dutiful 
petition to the throne, provided there was the most distant hope of success. But have we not tried this 
already? Have we not addressed the Lords, and remonstrated to the Commons 1 And to what end 1 Did 
they deign to look at our petitions ? Does it not appear, 
as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness, that there 
is a regular, systematic plan formed to fix the right and 
practice of taxation upon us? Does not the uniform 
conduct of Parliament for some years past confirm this ? 
Do not all the debates, especially those just brought to 
us, in the House of Commons on the side of government, 
expressly declare that America must be taxed in aid of 
the British funds, and that she has no longer resources 
within herself? Is there any thing to be expected from 
petitioning after this ? Is not the attack upon the liberty 
and property of the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, before restitution 
of the loss to the India Company was demanded, a plain 
and self-evident proof of what they are aiming at ? Do 
not the subsequent bills (now I dare say acts), for depriving the Massachusetts Bay of its charter, and for 
transporting offenders into other colonies or to Great 
Britain for trial, where it is impossible from the nature 
of the thing that justice can be obtained, convince us 
that the administration is determined to stick at nothing 
to carry its point? Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest test ? 
</p><p>
With you I think it a folly to attempt more than we 
can execute, as that will not only bring disgrace upon us, but weaken our cause ; yet I think we may do more 
than is generally believed, in respect to the non-importation scheme. As to the withholding of our remittances, 
that is another point, in which I own I have my doubts 
on several accounts, but principally on that of justice ; 
for I think, whilst we are accusing others of injustice, 
we should be just ourselves ; and how this can be, whilst 
we owe a considerable debt, and refuse payment of it to 
Great Britain, is to me inconceivable. Nothing but the 
last extremity, I think, can justify it. Whether this is 
now come, is the question. 
</p><p>
I began with telling you, that I was to write a short 
letter. My paper informs me I have done otherwise. 
I shall hope to see you to-morrow, at the meeting of the 
county in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, when these points are to be considered. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient and humble servant.
