<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 16 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter by express, of the 5th instant, I fear has 
fallen into the hands of the common enemy, for I never 
have seen it. The other of the 7th I this day received; 
1 and being exceedingly embarrassed to come at your intentions, and really at a loss to know in what manner to 
act, in such perplexed and difficult circumstances, I 
called a council of officers to my aid. The result of 
their advice you will find in the enclosed. 
</p><p>
It will not be in my power to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> by 
the 22 d, as your Honor desires ; but as soon after as I 
can, I certainly will. I shall leave orders with Colonel 
Stephen to march this garrison to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, as 
soon as it is relieved, which cannot be before this express may return, and then your further orders may be 
received. We have no advice of Dagworthy's inarching, though orders were sent to him. 
</p><p>
I shall order all the country's stores to be carried to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, and the two companies on Patterson's 
Creek to be posted on the Branch, to complete the 
number that was designed for that place. I have ordered a particular return of the provisions to be made 
out, and Colonel Stephen to take Captain Dagworthy's 
receipt for the quantity left. 
</p><p>
We have been at a good deal of unavoidable expense 
and trouble to furnish the Indians with such things as 
they wanted. Some hostile Indians killed two Catawbas on Thursday last, at about one hundred and fifty 
yards from the fort, and seventy from a sentry, and 
made their escape, though pursued by other Catawbas 
and near two hundred men. And the day before yesterday, two soldiers were killed and a third taken prisoner, as they were coming to this place from the fort 
below. The rest of the party, being ten in number, 
with Captain Waggener among them, made their escape. 
</p><p>
The enclosed remonstrance I have just received, and 
think it expedient to send it to your Honor, that you 
may know the temper and disposition of the troops. 
As I expect to be with you in two or three days after 
the express, I think it needless to add any thing but an apology for the incoherence of this letter. The Indians 
are all around teazing and perplexing me for one thing or another, so that I scarce know what I write. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c. 
</p>
