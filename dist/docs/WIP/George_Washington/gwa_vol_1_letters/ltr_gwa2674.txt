DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My former letters would inform you how little share I had in confining the Indians to the public jail at this place.
</p><p>
Mr. Atkin, in his Majesty's name, applied to me as 
commanding officer for aid to secure these people, 
which I thereupon rendered, but not without first 
representing the consequences, that might and in some 
measure really did happen. This step was no sooner 
taken, than the Cherokees in town, about twenty-two in 
number, despatched a runner to inform their people, 
that the English had fallen upon their brethren, and desired that they (the Cherokees) would stand upon their 
defence. Another runner, you know, went to Carlisle 
to inform the warriors there, who returned fully resolved 
to rescue the prisoners, or die in the attempt. The 
former they effected, and were so enraged with Mr. Atkin, that they would hold no conference with him the 
next day, when he sent to desire it, till they had first 
been with me for information. I took great pains to 
convince them, that it was a mistake, and happily succeeded. They agreed to send an Indian to their nation 
with an express, whom I might procure, to prevent a 
massacre of all the traders and white people there, 
which they looked upon as inevitable, unless timely 
measures were taken to prevent it. 
</p><p>
Out of the great number of drafts that have deserted 
from us, we have been able to apprehend twenty -two ; 
of whom two were hanged on Thursday last. The eight companies now remaining in Virginia are completed to about eighty men each, rank and file, four 
commanding officers, four sergeants, and two drummers, 
and are all marched to the several posts assigned them. 
The commission, which I have received from Governor Dinwiddie, to hold general courts-martial, is very 
long, and rather a repetition of the act. I should be 
obliged, if you would let me know whether this be right 
or not. I am, &,c.
