SIR, 
</p><p>
I came to this place last night, and find, that the articles mentioned in the enclosed invoice are wanted for 
the plantations on York River. Please to send them as 
there directed. 
</p><p>
We have little or no news. Our Assembly is at 
present convened to grant supplies for carrying on the war against the Cherokee Indians, should they choose 
to continue it ; but this I am persuaded they are by no 
means inclined to do, nor are they prepared for it, as 
they have been soliciting peace for some time past. I 
wish the powers of Europe were as well disposed to an 
accommodation as these poor wretches. A stop would 
then soon be put to the effusion of blood, and peace 
and plenty would resume their empire again, to the joy 
and content, I believe, of most ranks and degrees of 
people. I am, &,c. 
</p>
