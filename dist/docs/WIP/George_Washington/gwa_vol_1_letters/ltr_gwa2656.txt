<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 14 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The return of the express, that came with the account 
of La Force's escape, (for which accident I am extremely concerned, and fear its consequences if he is 
not retaken,) affords me an opportunity to inform you 
of some occurrences, which have happened since my 
last 
</p><p>
Repeated complaints and applications from all quarters for men, but more especially from the garrisons, 
which secure the communication with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
obliged me to order a company from Captain Waggeners detachment (for none else could spare a man) 
to reinforce and enable those garrisons to send escorts 
with wagons and expresses, going to and returning from 
that fort. Captain Waggener's command was thus reduced to a number insufficient to disperse parties among 
the settlers, and retain a strength to conduct the building of the forts. The grand point then turned on this ; 
whether he was to neglect the inhabitants and build the 
forts, or neglect the forts and protect the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
His council were of the latter opinion unanimously, 
and sent to know my sentiments, which I own corresponded with theirs, and for these reasons. First, I look 
upon it, that the protection of the inhabitants was the 
motive for ordering these forts ; and to lose them, while 
we are at work, would be perverting the intention. 
Secondly, we have built some forts and altered others, 
as far south on the Potomac waters as any settlers have 
been molested ; and there only remains one body of inhabitants, at a place called the Upper Tract, who need 
a guard. Thither I have ordered a party. Beyond 
this, if I am not misinformed, there is nothing but a continued series of mountains uninhabited, until we get 
over to the waters of James River, not far from the fort, 
which takes its name from your Honor; and thence to 
Mayo River. Captain Hogg, by your orders, is to have 
the direction. If I have done amiss, in not adhering to 
the letter of the law, I hope you will intimate the same, 
and give directions how I am to proceed. 
</p><p>
Two or three men have been killed and scalped at 
different places, since my last, though every precaution 
has been taken to prevent it. The fatiguing service, 
low pay, and great hardships in which our men have 
been engaged, cause, notwithstanding the greatest care 
and vigilance to the contrary, great and scandalous desertions. Yesterday I received an account, from Captain Stewart, of sixteen men deserting in a party. 
Frequently two or three went off before, as they have 
done from this place. We never fail to pursue, and use 
all possible means to apprehend them ; but seldom with 
success, as they are generally aided and assisted by the 
inhabitants. Two parties are now in pursuit of these 
fellows, who have made towards the northward to enlist with the recruiting officers in Pennsylvania. Unless 
a stop can be put to it, I fear we shall lose numbers of 
our men. 
</p><p>
A report prevailed in town yesterday, said to come 
from a man, who had it from a person that was at Governor Morris's treaty with the Indians, and heard them 
say, that a large body composed of different nations, and 
headed by some French, intended to attack <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> this fall. Reports of this kind often take rise 
without good foundation ; yet, as this is an affair of great 
importance, the slightest intelligence ought not to be 
discountenanced, especially when we consider that our 
provision, and, what is still more valuable, all our ammunition and stores, are lodged in that defenceless place. 
The consequence of a successful enterprise of this sort, 
and the absolute impossibility (considering the weakness 
of the place, badness of situation, and division of our 
force) of preventing its falling, are, without previous 
notice, motives sufficient for apprehending the worst. 
Therefore, notwithstanding I enlarged upon this subject 
in a former letter, I think it my duty to hint it again, and 
to ask directions how I am to proceed. 
</p><p>
It is true, I give no credit to this intelligence, because 
I flatter myself such important information as this would 
be communicated, in the most distinct and expeditious 
manner, by Governor Morris ; yet, it being an expedition they cannot fail of succeeding in, what should deter 
them from attempting it ? We have certain advice, that two of our deserters have reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, who 
were heard to speak in high terms, before they escaped, of the reward that would be got for communicating the 
weakness of the works and garrison at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
As a general meeting of all the persons concerned in 
the estate of my deceased brother is appointed to be 
held at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, about the middle of September next, 
for making a final settlement of all his affairs, and as I 
am very deeply interested, not only as an executor, and 
heir of part of his estate, but also in a very important 
dispute, subsisting between Colonel Lee, who married 
the widow, and my brothers and self, concerning a devise in the will, which brings the whole personal estate 
in question, I say, as this is a matter of very great 
moment to me, I hope your Honor will readily consent 
to my attending this meeting, provided no disadvantage 
is likely to arise during my absence ; in which case, I 
shall not offer to quit my command. 
</p><p>
If war is to be declared at this place, I should be glad 
if your Honor would direct the manner. I know there 
is ceremony required, but the order I am ignorant of. 
</p><p>
I am, &,c. 
</p>
