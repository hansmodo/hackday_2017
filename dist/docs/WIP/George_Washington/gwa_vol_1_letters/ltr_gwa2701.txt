TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 25 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I do not incline to propose any thing, that may seem 
officious, but would it not facilitate the operation of the 
campaign, if the Virginia troops were ordered to proceed 
as far as the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a>, and construct forts at the 
most advantageous situations as they advance, opening the 
road at the same time ? In such a case, I should be 
glad to be joined by that part of my regiment at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>. Major Peachey, who commands the working 
party on Braddock's road, writes to me, that he finds 
few repairs wanting. To-night I shall order him to 
proceed as far as Savage River, and then return, as his 
party is too weak to adventure further. 
</p><p>
We have received advice that our second convoy, of more than seventy wagons, will be at the South Branch to-day, where I expect they will be joined by other 
wagons with forage. They will all proceed to this place immediately. 
</p><p>
I shall most cheerfully work on any road, pursue any route, or enter upon any service, that the General or 
yourself may think me usefully employed in, or qualified for, and shall never have a will of my own, when a duty is required of me. But since you desire me to speak 
my sentiments freely, permit me to observe, that after having conversed with all the guides, and having been 
informed by others, who have a knowledge of the country, I am convinced that a road, to be compared with 
General Braddock's, or, indeed, that will be fit for transportation even by packhorses, cannot be made. I have 
no predilection for the route you have in contemplation 
for me, not because difficulties appear therein, but because I doubt whether satisfaction can be given in the 
execution of the plan. I know not what reports you 
may have received from your reconnoitring parties ; but 
I have been uniformly told, that, if you expect a tolerable road by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, you will be disappointed, for no 
movement can be made that way without destroying our 
horses. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely glad of one hour's conference 
with you, when the General arrives. I could then explain myself more fully, and, I think, demonstrate the 
advantages of pushing out a body of light troops in this 
quarter. I would make a trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> with great 
pleasure, if my presence here could be dispensed with 
for a day or two, of which you can best judge. 
</p><p>
I am, my dear Sir, with most sincere regard, your 
very obedient and affectionate servant. 
</p>
