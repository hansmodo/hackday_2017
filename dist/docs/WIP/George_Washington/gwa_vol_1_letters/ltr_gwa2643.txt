<p>
TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL STEPHEN. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 1 February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Looking upon our affairs at this critical juncture to be 
of such importance, and having a personal acquaintance 
with General Shirley, which I thought might add some 
weight to the strength of our memorial, I solicited leave, 
which is obtained, to visit him in person. I shall accordingly set out in two days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, having procured letters from the Governor. You may depend I 
shall leave no stone unturned for this salutary end ; and, 
I think, if reason, justice, and every equitable right can 
claim attention, we deserve to be heard. 
</p><p>
As I have taken the fatigue of this tedious journey 
upon myself, which I had never thought of until I left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, I hope you will conduct every thing in my 
absence for the interest and honor of the service. And 
I must exhort you in the most earnest manner to strict 
discipline and due exercise of arms. 
</p><p>
You may tell Mr. Livingston from me, that, if the 
soldiers are not skilled in arms equal to what may reasonably be expected, he most assuredly shall answer 
for it at my return. And I must frankly tell you, that I 
also expect to find them expert at bush-fighting. You 
are to order a particular account to be taken of the provisions, that are delivered to the Maryland and Carolina 
companies by the commissary. 
</p><p>
The Governor seems determined to make the officers 
comply with the terms of holding their commissions, or 
forfeit them. He approves of Dekeyser's suspension, 
and orders, that he shall not be admitted into the camp. 
He seems uneasy at what I own gives me much concern, namely, that gaming is introduced into the camp. 
</p><p>
I am ordered to discourage it, and must desire that you 
will intimate the same. 
</p><p>
As money may be wanted for paying the troops, and 
other incidental charges, order the paymaster down to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, where he may receive of Mr. Kirkpatrick 
the sum requisite. 
</p><p>
I think of nothing else at present ; so, with once more 
exhorting you to strict observation of discipline, I conclude, yours, &,c. 
</p>
