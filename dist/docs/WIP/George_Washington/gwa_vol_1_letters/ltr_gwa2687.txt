TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL STANWIX. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 10 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Permit me, at the same time that I congratulate you, 
which I most sincerely do, on your promotion, so justly 
merited, to express my concern at the prospect of 
parting with you. I can truly say, that it is a matter of 
no small regret to me, and that I should have thought 
myself happy in serving this campaign under your immediate command. But every thing, I hope, is ordered 
for the best, and it is our duty to submit. I must, nevertheless, beg, that you will add one more kindness to 
the many I have experienced, and that is, to mention 
me in favorable terms to General Forbes, if you are acquainted with that gentleman, not as a person, who would depend upon him for further recommendation to 
military preferment (for I have long conquered all such 
inclinations, and shall serve this campaign merely for 
the purpose of affording my best endeavours to bring 
matters to a conclusion), but as a person, who would 
gladly be distinguished in some measure from the common run of provincial officers, as I understand there will 
be a motley herd of us.
</p><p>
Nothing can contribute more to his Majesty's interest 
in this quarter, than an early campaign, or a speedy 
junction of the troops to be employed in this service. 
Without this, I fear the Indians will with difficulty be 
restrained from returning to their nation before we assemble, and, in that event, no words can tell how much 
they will be missed. It is an affair of great importance, 
and ought to claim the closest attention of the commanding officer. On the assistance of these people the 
security of our march very much depends. 
</p><p>
Great care should be taken, also, to lay in a supply 
of proper goods for them. The Indians are mercenary ; 
every service of theirs must be purchased; and they 
are easily offended, being thoroughly sensible of their 
own importance. Upwards of five hundred are already 
come to this place, the greater part of whom are gone 
to war. Many others are daily expected, and we have 
neither arms nor clothes suitable to give them. Nor, 
indeed, is it reasonable to expect, that the whole expense accruing on account of these people should fall 
upon this government, which has already in this particular, as well as in many others, exerted its utmost abilities for his Majesty's interest, and, in the present case, 
shares only an equal proportion of the advantages arising from Indian services. 
</p><p>
These crude thoughts are hastily thrown together. If 
you find any thing in them, which may be useful, be 
pleased to turn them to his Majesty's interest. The 
indulgence, which you have hitherto allowed me, joined 
to my zeal for the service, has encouraged me to use 
this freedom with you, Sir, which I should not choose 
to take unasked with another. 
</p><p>
If it .is not improper, I should be glad to be informed 
what regular troops are to be employed under BrigadierGeneral Forbes, and when they may be expected? 
Also, where they are to rendezvous. 
</p><p>
Fort Frederic, I hear, is mentioned for this purpose, 
and, in my humble opinion, a little unadvisedly. In the 
first place, because the country people all around are 
fled, and the troops will, consequently, lack those refreshments so needful to soldiers. In the next place, I 
am fully convinced there never can be a road made between Fort Frederic and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, that will 
admit the transportation of carriages. I have passed it 
in company with many others, who were of the same 
opinion. Lastly, because this is the place [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>] to which all Indian parties, either going to, or returning from war, will inevitably repair. 
</p><p>
I am with most sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient and obliged humble servant. 
</p>
