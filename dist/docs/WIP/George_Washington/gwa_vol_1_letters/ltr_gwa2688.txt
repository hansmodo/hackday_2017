MY DEAR HALKET, 
</p><p>
Are we to have you once more among us? And shall we revisit together a hapless spot, that proved so 
fatal to many of our former brave companions ? Yes ; and I rejoice at it, hoping it will now be in our power to 
testify a just abhorrence of the cruel butcheries exercised on our friends, in the unfortunate day of General 
Braddock's defeat ; and, moreover, to show our enemies, that we can practise all that lenity of which they only boast, without affording any adequate proofs. 
</p><p>
To cut short, I really feel a satisfaction at the prospect of meeting you again, although I have scarcely time to tell you so, as the express is waiting. 
</p><p>
I am with most sincere regard, dear Sir, yours, 
</p>
