TO CAPTAIN ROBERT MACKENZIE, AT VENANGO.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Had your favor of the 17th of August come to 
my hands before the 18th instant, I should not have 
given you the trouble of perusing my answer to it at 
this late season. I am sorry, that you should think it 
necessary to introduce a request to me, which is founded 
on reason and equity, with an apology. Had you claimed that as a right, which you seem to ask as a favor, I 
should have thought myself wanting in that justice, 
which is the distinguishing characteristic of an honest 
man, to have withheld it from you. 
</p><p>
But how to answer your purposes, and at the same 
time to avoid the imputation of impertinence, I am, I 
confess, more at a loss to determine. That General 
Amherst may have heard of such a person as I am, is 
probable, and this I dare venture to say is the chief 
knowledge he has of me. How then should I appear 
to him in an epistolary way ? And to sit down and 
write a certificate of your behaviour carries with it an 
air of formality, that seems more adapted to the case of 
a soldier than that of an officer. I must, therefore, beg 
the favor of you to make what use you please of this 
letter. 
</p><p>
For, Sir, with not more pleasure than truth, I can 
declare to you and the world, that while I had the honor 
of commanding the regiment, your conduct, both as an 
officer and a gentleman, was unexceptionable, and in 
every instance, as far as I was capable of discerning, 
such as to merit applause from better judges. Since 
my time, Colonel Byrd has been witness to your 
behaviour, and his letter recommendatory must, I am 
persuaded, do you more service than my sanguine endeavours. Although neither he, nor any other person, 
is more sensible of your worth, or more inclined to contribute his best offices to the completion of your wishes, 
than, Sir, your obedient servant. 
</p>
