TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES.

Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 1 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We are still encamped here, very sickly, and quite 
dispirited at the prospect before us. 
</p><p>
That appearance of glory, which we had once in 
view, that hope, that laudable ambition of serving our 
country, and meriting its applause, are now no more ; 
all is dwindled into ease, sloth, and fatal inactivity. In 
a word, all is lost, if the ways of men in power, like 
certain ways of Providence, are not inscrutable. But 
we, who view the actions of great men at a distance, 
can only form conjectures agreeably to a limited perception ; and, being ignorant of the comprehensive 
schemes, which may be in contemplation, might mistake 
egregiously in judging of things from appearances, or by 
the lump. Yet every fool will have his notions, will 
prattle and talk away ; and why may not I ? We seem 
then, in my opinion, to act under the guidance of an evil 
genius. The conduct of our leaders, if not actuated by 
superior orders, is tempered with something, I do not 
care to give a name to. Nothing now but a miracle can 
bring this campaign to a happy issue. 
</p><p>
In my last, if I remember rightly, I told you, that I 
had employed my small abilities in opposing the measures then concerting. To do this, I not only represented the advanced season, the difficulty of cutting a 
new road over these mountains, the short time left for that service, the moral certainty of its obstructing our 
march, and the consequent miscarriage of the expedition ; I endeavoured to represent, also, the hard struggle 
Virginia had made this year in raising a second regiment 
upon so short a notice, the great expense of doing it, 
and her inability for future exertion. I spoke my fears 
concerning the southern Indians, in the event of a miscarriage. But I spoke all unavailingly, for the road was 
immediately begun, and from one to two thousand men 
have since constantly wrought upon it. By the last accounts I have received, they had cut it to the foot of 
Laurel Hill, about thirty-five miles ; and I suppose by 
this time fifteen hundred men have taken post at a place 
called <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, about ten miles further, where our 
next fort is intended to be constructed. 
</p><p>
We have certain intelligence, that the French strength 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, on the 13th ultimo, did not exceed 
eight hundred men, Indians included, of whom there 
appeared to be about three or four hundred. This account is corroborated on all hands. Two officers of the 
first Virginia regiment, Chew and Allen, have since 
come from thence, both in different parties, and at different times, after lying a day or two concealed in full 
view of the fort, and observing the motions and strength 
of the enemy. See, therefore, how our time has been 
misspent. Behold how the golden opportunity has been 
lost, perhaps never more to be regained ! How is it to 
be accounted for'] Can General Forbes have orders 
for this ? Impossible. Will, then, our injured country 
pass by such abuses 1 I hope not. Rather let a full 
representation of the matter go to his Majesty. Let 
him know how grossly his glory and interest, and the 
public money, have been prostituted. I wish I were 
sent immediately home [to England], as an aid to some 
other on this errand. I think, without vanity, I could set the conduct of this expedition in its true colors, 
having taken some pains, perhaps more than any other man, to dive to the bottom of it. But no more. 
</p><p>
Colonel Byrd, who is unwell, joins me in compliments 
to you, the Attorney -General, and the rest of our friends. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
