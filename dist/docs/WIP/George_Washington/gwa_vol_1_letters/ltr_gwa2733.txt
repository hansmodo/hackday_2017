<p>
TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 15 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1771">1771</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
The very obliging offer your Lordship was pleased to 
make, the day I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, in behalf of the 
officers and soldiers, who, under the faith of government, lay claim to two hundred thousand acres of land, 
on the waters of the Ohio, promised them by proclamamation in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, I did not embrace, because it is evident 
to me, who am in some degree acquainted with the 
situation of that country, and the rapid progress now 
making in the settlement of it, that delay at this time in 
the prosecution of our plan would amount to the loss of 
the land, inasmuch as emigrants are daily and hourly 
settling on the choice spots, and waiting a favorable 
opportunity to solicit legal titles, on the ground of preoccupancy, when the office shall be opened. I therefore 
hoped, and the officers and soldiers, who have suffered 
in the cause of their country, still hope, that, although 
your Lordship was of opinion you could not at that time 
vest them with an absolute and bond fide grant of the 
land, yet that you will permit them to take such steps, 
at their own expense and risk, as others do, to secure 
their lands agreeably to proclamation, especially as their 
claim is prior to any other, and better founded, they 
having a solemn act of government and the general 
voice of the country in their favor. 
</p><p>
This is the light, my Lord, in which the matter appeared to me, and in this light it is also considered by 
the officers with whom I have lately had a meeting. 
The report gains ground, that a large tract of country 
on the Ohio, including every foot of land to the westward of the Allegany Mountains, is granted to a company of gentlemen in England, to be formed into a 
separate government. If this report is really well founded, there can be no doubt of your Lordship's having 
the earliest and most authentic accounts of it, since it 
so essentially interferes with the interests and expectations of this country. 
</p><p>
To request the favor of your Lordship to inform me 
whether this report be true, and, if true, whether any 
attention has been or probably will be paid to the order 
of Council and proclamation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, may be presumptuous ; but, as the officers and soldiers confide in me to 
transact this business for them, and as it would be a real 
advantage to them to know the truth of this report, and 
how it is likely to affect them, there needs no other 
apology for my taking the liberty of addressing to you 
this request, in the hope that your Lordship will condescend to do me the honor of writing a line on the subject by the next post to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, which will be 
acknowledged as a peculiar obligation conferred on, 
my Lord, your Lordship's most obedient servant. 
</p>
