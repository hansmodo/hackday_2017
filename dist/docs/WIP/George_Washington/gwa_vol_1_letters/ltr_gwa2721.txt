DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had the pleasure of receiving 
your obliging favors of the 16th of October and 1st 
of January. A mixture of bad health and indolence 
has kept me, till this time, from paying that due respect 
to your letters, which they merited at my hands ; and 
now, having nothing to relate that could in any wise 
claim your attention, I was still inclined to a further 
delay. 
</p><p>
The entire conquest of Canada, and of the French 
in most parts of North America, being a story too stale 
to relate in these days, we are often at a loss for something with which to fill our letters. True it is, the 
Cherokee nation, by a perfidious conduct, has caused 
Colonel Grant to be sent once more into their country 
with an armed force ; but I believe supplies from the 
French on Mobile River come in so slowly, that they are 
more sincerely disposed to peace now than ever they 
were before. This pacific turn may be caused in some 
measure, too, by another regiment in the pay of this 
colony, which is ordered to penetrate into their country 
by a different passage. But it is generally thought, that 
their submission will put a stop to any further progress of our arms.
</p><p>
We have received the account of the reduction of 
Belle Isle, and we hear of another fleet destined for 
some service, of which we are ignorant. But that, 
which most engrosses our attention at this time, is the 
congress at Augsburg, as I believe nothing is more sincerely desired in this part of tne world, than an honorable peace. I am, &c. 
</p>
