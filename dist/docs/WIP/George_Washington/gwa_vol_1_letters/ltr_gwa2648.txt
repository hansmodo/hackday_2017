<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 22 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This encloses several letters, and the minutes of a 
council of war, which was held upon the receipt of 
them. Your Honor may see to what unhappy straits 
the distressed inhabitants and myself are reduced. I 
am too little acquainted, Sir, with pathetic language to 
attempt a description of the people's distresses, though 
I have a generous soul, sensible of wrongs, and swelling 
for redress. But what can I do ? I see their situation, 
know their danger, and participate their sufferings, without having it in my power to give them further relief, 
than uncertain promises. In short, I see inevitable 
destruction in so clear a light, that, unless vigorous 
measures are taken by the Assembly, and speedy assistance sent from below, the poor inhabitants that are 
now in forts, must unavoidably fall, while the remainder 
are flying before the barbarous foe. In fine, the melancholy situation of the people, the little prospect of 
assistance, the gross and scandalous abuses cast upon 
the officers in general, which is reflecting upon me in 
particular, for suffering misconduct of such extraordinary 
kinds, and the distant prospect, if any, of gaining honor 
and reputation in the service, cause me to lament the 
hour, that gave me a commission, and would induce me, 
at any other time than this of imminent danger, to resign, without one hesitating moment, a command, from 
which I never expect to reap either honor or benefit ; 
but, on the contrary, have almost an absolute certainty 
of incurring displeasure below, while the murder of 
helpless families may be laid to my account here ! 
</p><p>
The supplicating tears of the women, and moving petitions of the men, melt me into such deadly sorrow, 
that I solemnly declare, if I know my own mind, I could 
offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy, 
provided that would contribute to the people's ease. 
</p><p>
Lord Fairfax has ordered men from the adjacent 
counties, but when they will come, or in what numbers, 
I cannot pretend to determine. If I may judge from 
the success we have met with here, I have but little 
hope, as three days' incessant endeavours have produced but twenty men. 
</p><p>
I have too often urged my opinion for vigorous measures, and shall only add, that, besides the accounts you 
will receive in the letters, we are told from all parts, that 
the woods appear to be alive with Indians, who feast 
upon the fat of the land. As we have not more than a 
barrel or two of powder at this place, the rest being at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I could wish that some might be sent 
up. I have written to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, 
desiring that two barrels may be sent from each place, 
but whether there is any at either, I know not. I have 
sent orders to Captain Harrison to be diligent on the waters where he is posted, and to use his utmost endeavours to protect the people; and, if possible, to 
surprise the enemy at their sleeping-places. Ashby's 
letter is a very extraordinary one. The design of the 
Indians was only, in my opinion, to intimidate him into 
a surrender. For which reason I have written him 
word, that if they do attack him, he must defend that 
place to the last extremity, and when bereft of hope, 
lay a train to blow up the fort, and retire by night to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
A small fort, which we have at the mouth of Patterson's Creek, containing an officer and thirty men guarding 
stores, was attacked smartly by the French and Indians ; 
they were as warmly received, upon which they retired. 
Our men at present are dispersed in small bodies, 
guarding the people and public stores. 
</p><p>
I am your Honor's, &c. 
</p>
