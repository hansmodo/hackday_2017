<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
Without date.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Since writing my last I have still stronger presumption, indeed almost confirmation, that they were sent as 
spies, and were ordered to wait near us, till they were 
truly informed of our intentions, situation, and strength, 
and were to have acquainted their commander therewith, and to have lain lurking here for reinforcements 
before they served the summons, if served at all. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but they will endeavour to amuse you with many smooth stories, as they did me ; but they 
were confuted in them all, and, by circumstances too 
plain to be denied, almost made ashamed of their assertions. I dare say you will treat them with respect, 
which is due to all unfortunate persons in their condition. 
But I hope you will give no ear to what they will have 
an opportunity for displaying to the best advantage, 
having none present to contradict their reports. 
</p><p>
I have heard, since they went away, that they should 
say they called to us not to fire; but that I know to be 
false, for I was the first man that approached them, and 
the first whom they saw, and immediately upon it they 
ran to their arms, and fired briskly till they were 
defeated. 
</p><p>
We have heard of another being killed by the Indians, 
that made his escape from us ; so that we are certain of 
thirty-three killed and taken. I thought it expedient 
to acquaint your Honor with the above, as I fancy they 
will have the assurance of asking the privileges due to 
an embassy, when in strict justice they ought to be 
hanged as spies of the worst sort, being authorized by 
their commander, at the expense of a character, which 
should be sacred to all nations, and never trifled with or 
used in an equivocal way.  I am, &c. 
</p>
