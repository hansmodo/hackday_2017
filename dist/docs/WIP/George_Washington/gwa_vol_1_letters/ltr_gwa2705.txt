DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Twenty-five Catawbas came here this evening, and 
the convoy may be expected the day after to-morrow, 
as it was at PearsalPs last night. 
</p><p>
Governor Sharpe may be expected here in a day or 
two. I am at a loss to know how he ranks, and whether 
he is entitled to the command. In the British army his 
rank is that of lieutenant-colonel only, but what it may 
be as a governor, in his own province, I really do not 
know, nor whether he has any out of the troops of his 
province. I should, therefore, be glad of your advice, 
being unwilling to dispute the point with him wrongfully, or to give up the command, if I have a right to it.  
</p><p>
I am, &,c.
