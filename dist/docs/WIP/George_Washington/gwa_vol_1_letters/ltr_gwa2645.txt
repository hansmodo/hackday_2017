<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 7 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, and think it advisable to 
despatch an express (notwithstanding I hear two or three are already sent down) to inform you of the unhappy situation of affairs in this quarter. The enemy 
have returned in greater numbers, committed several murders not far from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and even are so daring as to attack our forts in open day, as you may see 
by the enclosed letters and papers. Many of the inhabitants are in a miserable situation by their losses, and 
so apprehensive of danger, that, I believe, unless a stop 
is put to the depredations of the Indians, the Blue Ridge 
will soon become our frontier. 
</p><p>
I find it impossible to continue on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, until a body of men can be raised. I have advised 
with Lord Fairfax, and other officers of the militia, who 
have ordered each captain to call a private muster, and 
to read the exhortation enclosed (for orders are no 
longer regarded in this county), in hopes that this expedient may meet with the desired success. If it should, 
I shall, with such men as are ordered from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> to join these, scour the woods and suspected 
places, in all the mountains and valleys, on this part of 
our frontiers ; and doubt not but I shall fall in with the 
Indians and their more cruel associates. I hope the 
present emergency of affairs, assisted by such good 
news as the Assembly may by this time have received 
from England, and from the Commissioners, will determine them to take vigorous measures for their own and 
country's safety, and no longer depend on an uncertain 
way of raising men for their own protection. However 
absurd it may appear, it is nevertheless certain, that five 
hundred Indians have it more in their power to annoy 
the inhabitants, than ten times their number of regulars. 
Besides the advantageous way they have of fighting 
in the woods, their cunning and craft, their activity 
and patient sufferings, are not to be equalled. They 
prowl about like wolves, and, like them, do their mischief by stealth. They depend upon their dexterity in 
hunting and upon the cattle of the inhabitants for provisions. For these reasons, I own, I do not think it 
unworthy of the notice of the legislature to compel the 
inhabitants (if a general war is likely to ensue, and 
things are to continue in this unhappy situation for any 
time,) to live in townships, working at each other's farms 
by turns, and to drive their cattle into the thickly settled 
parts of the country. Were this done, they could not 
be cut off by small parties, and large ones could not 
subsist without provisions. 
</p><p>
It seemed to be the sentiment of the House of Burgesses when I was down, that a chain of forts should 
be erected upon our frontiers, for the defence of the 
people. This expedient, in my opinion, without an inconceivable number of men, will never answer their 
expectations. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor has had a particular account of Major Lewis's unsuccessful attempt to get to 
the Shawanese Town. It was an expedition, from 
which, on account of the length of the march, I always 
had little hope, and often expressed my uneasy apprehensions on that head. But since they are returned, 
with the Indians that accompanied them, I think it 
would be a very happy step to prevail upon the latter 
to proceed as far as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. It is in their power to be of infinite use to us ; and without Indians, 
we shall never be able to cope with those cruel foes to our country.
</p><p>
I would therefore beg leave to recommend in a very earnest manner, that your Honor would send an express 
to them immediately for this desirable end. I should 
have done it myself, but was uncertain whether it might 
prove agreeable or not. I also hope you will order 
Major Lewis to secure his guides, as I understand he attributes all his misfortunes to their misconduct. Such 
offences should meet with adequate punishment, or else 
we may ever be misled by designing villains. I am 
your Honor's, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above, Mr. Paris, who commanded a party, is returned. He relates, that, upon the 
North River, he fell in with a small body of Indians whom 
he engaged, and, after a contest of half an hour, put 
them to flight. Monsieur Donville, commander of the 
party, was killed and scalped, and his instructions found 
about him, which I enclose. We had one man killed, 
and two wounded. Mr. Paris sent the scalp by Jenkins; 
and I hope, although it is not an Indian's, they will meet 
with an adequate reward. The whole party jointly 
claim the reward, no person pretending solely to assume 
the merit. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may in some measure penetrate into the 
daring designs of the French by their instructions, in 
which orders are given to burn, if possible, our magazine 
at Conococheague, a place that is in the midst of a 
thickly settled country. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the party there to be made as strong 
as time and our present circumstances will permit, lest 
they should attempt to execute the instructions of 
Dumas.  I have also ordered up an officer and twenty 
recruits to assist Joseph Edwards, and the 'people on 
those waters. The inhabitants of this town are under 
dreadful apprehensions of an attack, and all the roads 
between this and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> are much infested. 
As I apprehend you will be obliged to draft men, I hope 
care will be taken, that none shall be chosen but active, 
resolute men, who are practised in the use of arms, and are marksmen. 
</p>
