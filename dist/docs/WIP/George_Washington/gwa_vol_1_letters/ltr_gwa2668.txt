DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We receive fresh proofs every day of the bad direction of our Indian affairs. It is not easy to tell what 
expenses have arisen on account of these Indians, how 
dissatisfied they are, and how gloomy the prospect of 
pleasing them appears, while we pursue our present 
system of management. 
</p><p>
I therefore beg leave to propose a plan, which I know 
is exactly conformable to the French policy, and which 
may, if properly executed, be a means of retrieving our 
lost credit with these people, and prove of infinite service to the country. The French have a proper person 
appointed to the direction of these affairs, who makes it 
his sole business to study the dispositions of the Indians, 
and the art of pleasing them. This person is invested 
with power to treat with and reward them for every piece of service, and thus, by timely presents on suitable 
occasions, to obtain very great advantages. There is 
always a store of goods committed to his care to answer 
these purposes, and no other person is suffered to meddle with it ; by which means the whole business is 
thrown into one channel, and it thereby becomes easy 
and regular. Whereas, with us it is every body's business, and no one's, to afford supplies. Every person attempts to please, and few succeed in it, because one 
promises this, and another that, and few can perform 
any thing, but are obliged to shuffle and put the Indians 
off, to get rid of their importunities. 
</p><p>
Hence they accuse us of perfidy and deceit. I could 
recapitulate a great number of their reproachful complaints, if I judged it necessary to confirm what I have 
already advanced. But I believe, Sir, you are convinced from what you have seen, that there can be no 
deception in my story. Therefore, I shall remark with 
candor, freedom, and submission, that, unless some person is appointed to manage the Indian affairs of this 
colony, under the direction of the Governor, or the 
southern agent,  a vast expense and but a little advantage will accrue from the coming of the Indians among 
us. And I know of no person so well qualified for an 
undertaking of this sort as the bearer, Captain Gist. He 
has had extensive dealings with the Indians, is in great 
esteem among them, well acquainted with their manners 
and customs, indefatigable, and patient, most excellent qualities where Indians are concerned. As to his 
capacity, honesty, and zeal, I dare venture to engage. 
If he should be appointed to this duty, or, if this plan 
should take effect, I dare say you will judge it advisable to send for a large assortment of that species of goods 
best suited for carrying on the abovementioned business. 
</p><p>
Bullen, a Catawba warrior, has been proposing a plan 
to Captain Gist for bringing in the Creek and Chickasaw Indians. If such a scheme could be effected, by 
the time we shall march for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, it would be 
a glorious undertaking, and worthy of the man. 
</p><p>
I am, &c.
