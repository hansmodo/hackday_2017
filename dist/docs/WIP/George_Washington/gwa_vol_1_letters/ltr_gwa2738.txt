<p>
TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 13 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
In obedience to your Lordship's request, I do myself 
the honor to inform you, that, by letters this day received from Dr. Cooper of King's College in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I 
find it will be about the first of next month before I 
shall set off for that place, and that it will perhaps be 
the middle of June before I return. Harvest then coming on, and seldom ending till after the middle of July, 
I could almost wish to see it accomplished ; but if the 
delay in doing it is attended with any kind of inconvenience to your Lordship, I will, at all events, be ready by 
the first of July to accompany you through any and 
every part of the western country, which you may 
think proper to visit. 
</p><p>
I beg the favor of your Lordship to inform me, 
therefore, as nearly as you can, of the precise time you 
will do me the honor of calling here, that I may get 
ready accordingly, and give notice of it to Mr. Crawford (if your Lordship purposes to take the route of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>), whom I took the liberty of recommending as 
a good woods-man, and well acquainted with the lands 
in that quarter, that he may be disengaged when we 
get to his house, which is directly on that communication. I am persuaded, that such a person will be found 
very necessary in an excursion of this sort, from his 
superior knowledge of the country, and of the inhabitants, who are thinly scattered over it. 
</p><p>
No person can be better acquainted with the equipage and simple conveniences necessary in an undertaking of this sort, than your Lordship, and, therefore, 
it would be impertinent in me to mention them ; but if 
your Lordship should find it convenient to have any thing provided in this part of the country, and will 
please to honor me with your commands, they shall be 
punctually obeyed. As, also, if your Lordship chooses 
to have an Indian engaged, I will write to Colonel 
Croghan, Deputy Indian Agent, who lives near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, to have one provided. 
</p><p>
The design of my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is to take 
my son-in-law, Mr. Custis, to King's College. If your 
Lordship, therefore, has any letters or commands, either 
to that place or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I shall think myself honored in being the bearer of them, as well as benefited 
by means of the introduction. 
</p><p>
I am, with the greatest respect, your Lordship's most 
obedient and most humble servant. 
</p>
