DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I must acknowledge you had great reason to be terrified at the first accounts, that were given of our unhappy 
defeat ; and, I must own, I was not a little surprised to 
find, that Governor Innes was the means of alarming 
the country with a report so extraordinary, without having better confirmation of the truth, than the story of an 
affrighted wagoner ! 
</p><p>
It is true, we have been beaten, shamefully beaten, 
by a handful of men, who only intended to molest and 
disturb our march. Victory was their smallest expectation. But see the wondrous works of Providence, 
and the uncertainty of human things ! We, but a few 
moments before, believed our numbers almost equal to 
the Canadian force ; they only expected to annoy us. 
Yet, contrary to all expectation and human probability, 
and even to the common course of things, we were 
totally defeated, and sustained the loss of every thing. 
This, as you observe, must be an affecting story to the 
colony, and will, no doubt, license the tongues of people 
to censure those, whom they think most blamable; 
which, by the by, often falls very wrongfully. I join 
very heartily with you in believing, that when this story 
comes to be related in future annals, it will meet with 
unbelief and indignation, for had I not been witness to the fact on that fatal day, I should scarcely have given credit to it even now.
</p><p>
Whenever it suits you to come into Fairfax, I hope you will make your home at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>. I assure 
you, nothing could have added more to the satisfaction of my safe return, than hearing of the friendly concern 
that has been expressed on my supposed death. I 
am, &,c. 
</p>
