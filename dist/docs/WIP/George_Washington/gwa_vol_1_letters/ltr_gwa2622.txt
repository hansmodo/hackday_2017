DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I overtook the General at Frederic Town, in Maryland. Thence we proceeded to this place, where we 
shall remain till the arrival of the second division of the 
train, which we hear left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> on Tuesday last. 
After that, we shall continue our march to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>; 
from whence, it is imagined, we shall not stir till the 
latter end of this month, for want of wagons and other 
conveniences of transport over the mountains. 
</p><p>
You will naturally conclude, that to pass through 
Maryland, when no object required it, was an uncommon, and an extraordinary route for the General and for 
Colonel Dunbar's regiment to .this place. The reason, 
however, was obvious. Those who promoted it had 
rather the communication should be opened that way, 
than through Virginia; but I believe the eyes of the 
General are now opened, and the imposition detected ; 
consequently, the like will not happen again. I am, &c. 
</p>
