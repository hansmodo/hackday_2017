</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From a sudden hint of your brother's, I wrote to you 
a few days ago in a hurry. Having since had more 
time for reflection, I now write deliberately, and with 
greater precision, on the subject of my last letter. 
</p><p>
I then desired the favor of you (as I understood rights 
might now be had for the lands, which have fallen within 
the Pennsylvania line,) to look me out a tract of about 
fifteen hundred, two thousand, or more acres somewhere in your neighbourhood, meaning only by this, 
that it may be as contiguous to your own settlement, as 
such a body of good land can be found. It will be easy 
for you to conceive, that ordinary or even middling 
lands would never answer my purpose or expectation, 
so far from navigation, and under such a load of expenses, as these lands are encumbered with. No; a 
tract to please me must be rich, of which no person can 
be a better judge than yourself, and, if possible, level. 
Could such a piece of land be found, you would do me 
a singular favor in falling upon some method of securing 
it immediately from the attempts of others, as nothing is 
more certain, than that the lands cannot remain long ungranted, when once it is known, that rights are to be had. 
</p><p>
The mode of proceeding I am at a loss to point out 
to you ; but, as your own lands are under the same circumstances, self-interest will naturally lead you to an 
inquiry. I am told, that the land or surveyor's office is 
kept at Carlisle. If so, I am of opinion that Colonel 
Armstrong, an acquaintance of mine, has something to 
do in the direction of it, and I am persuaded he would 
readily serve me. I will write to him by the first opportunity on that subject, that the way may be prepared 
for your application to him, if you find it necessary. 
For your trouble and expense you may depend on being repaid. It is possible, but I do not know that it 
really is the case, that the custom in Pennsylvania will 
not admit so large a quantity of land, as I require, to be 
entered together; if so, this may perhaps be arranged 
by making several entries to the same amount, if the 
expense of doing it is not too heavy. This I only drop 
as a hint, leaving the whole to your discretion and good 
management. If the land can only be secured from 
others, it is all I want at present. The surveying I 
would choose to postpone, at least till the spring, when, 
if you can give me any satisfactory account of this matter, and of what I am next going to propose, I expect to 
pay you a visit about the last of April. 
</p><p>
I offered in my last to join you, in attempting to secure some of the most valuable lands in the King's part, 
which I think may be accomplished after a while, notwithstanding the proclamation, that restrains it at present, and prohibits the settling of them at all ; for I can 
never look upon that proclamation in any other light 
(but this I say between ourselves), than as a temporary 
expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians. It must 
fall, of course, in a few years, especially when those Indians consent to our occupying the lands. Any person, 
therefore, who neglects the present opportunity of hunting out good lands, and in some measure marking and 
distinguishing them for his own, in order to keep others 
from settling them, will never regain it. If you will be 
at the trouble of seeking out the lands, I will take upon 
me the part of securing them, as soon as there is a possibility of doing it, and will moreover be at all the cost 
and charges of surveying and patenting the same. You 
shall then have such a reasonable proportion of the 
whole, as we may fix upon at our first meeting ; as I 
shall find it necessary, for the better furthering of the 
design, to let some of my friends be concerned in the 
scheme, who must also partake of the advantages. 
</p><p>
By this time it may be easy for you to discover, that 
my plan is to secure a good deal of land. You will consequently come in for a very handsome quantity ; and as you will obtain it without any costs, or expenses, I hope 
you will be encouraged to begin the search in time. I 
would choose, if it were practicable, to get large tracts 
together ; and it might be desirable to have them as near 
your settlement, or Fort Pitt, as they can be obtained 
of good quality, but not to neglect others at a greater 
distance, if fine bodies of it lie in one place. It may be 
worthy of your inquiry, to find out how the Maryland 
back line will run, and what is said about laying off 
Neale's grant. I will inquire particularly concerning the 
Ohio Company, that we may know what to apprehend 
from them. For my own part, I should have no objection to a grant of land upon the Ohio, a good way below 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, but would first willingly secure some valuable 
tracts nearer at hand. 
</p><p>
I recommend, that you keep this whole matter a secret, or trust it only to those, in whom you can confide, 
and who can assist you in bringing it to bear by their 
discoveries of land. This advice proceeds from several 
very good reasons, and, in the first place, because I 
might be censured for the opinion I have given in respect to the King's proclamation, and then, if the scheme 
I am now proposing to you were known, it might give 
the alarm to others, and, by putting them upon a plan 
of the same nature, before we could lay a proper foundation for success ourselves, set the different interests 
clashing, and, probably, in the end, overturn the whole. 
All this may be avoided by a silent management, and 
the operation carried on by you under the guise of hunting game, which you may, I presume, effectually do, at 
the same time you are in pursuit of land. When this is fully discovered, advise me of it, and if there appears 
but a possibility of succeeding at any time hence, I will 
have the lands immediately surveyed, to keep others 
off, and leave the rest to time and my own assiduity. 
</p><p>
If this letter should reach your hands before you set 
out, I should be glad to have your thoughts fully expressed on the plan here proposed, or as soon afterwards as convenient ; for I am desirous of knowing in 
due time how you approve of the scheme. I am, &c. 
</p>
