<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, 25 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
Captain Trent's ensign, Mr. Ward, has this day arrived 
from the Fork of the Monongahela, and brings the disagreeable account, that the fort, on the 17th instant, 
was surrendered at the summons of Monsieur Centre cceur to a body of French, consisting of upwards of one 
thousand men, who came from Venango with eighteen 
pieces of cannon, sixty batteaux, and three hundred 
canoes. They gave him liberty to bring off all his men 
and working-tools, which he accordingly did the same day. 
</p><p>
Immediately upon this information I called a council 
of war, to advise on proper measures to be taken in this 
exigency. A copy of their resolves, with the proceedings, I herewith enclose by the bearer, whom I have 
continued express to your Honor for more minute 
intelligence. 
</p><p>
Mr. Ward has the summons with him, and a speech 
from the Half-King, which I also enclose, with the 
wampum. He is accompanied by one of the Indians 
mentioned therein, who were sent to see where we 
were, what was our strength, and to know the time to 
expect us out. The other young man I have prevailed 
upon to return to the Half- King with the following 
speech. 
</p><p>
" Sachems, Warriors of the Six United Nations, 
Shannoahs, and Delawares, our friends and brethren. I received your speech by the Buck's brother [Mr. Ward], 
who came to us with the two young men five sleeps 
after leaving you. We return you thanks from hearts 
glowing with affection for your steadfast adherence to 
us, for your kind speech, and for your wise counsels 
and directions to the Buck's brother. 
</p><p>
" The young man will inform you where he met a 
small part of our army advancing towards you, clearing 
the road for a great number of our warriors, who are 
immediately to follow with our great guns, our ammunition, and our provisions. 
</p><p>
" I could not delay to let you know our hearts, and 
have sent back one of the young men with this speech 
to acquaint you with them. I have sent the other, 
according to your desire, to the governor of Virginia, 
with the Buck's brother, to deliver your speech and 
wampum, and to be an eyewitness of the preparations 
we are making to come in haste to support you, whose 
interest is as dear to us as our lives. We resent the 
usage of the treacherous French, and our conduct will 
henceforth plainly show you how much we have it at 
heart. 
</p><p>
"I cannot be easy without seeing you before our 
forces meet at the fork of the roads, and therefore I 
have the greatest desire that you and Escuniate, or one 
of you, should meet me on the road as soon as possible 
to assist us in council. 
</p><p>
" To assure you of the good will we bear you, and to 
confirm the truth of what has been said, I herewith present to you a string of wampum, that you may thereby 
remember how much I am your brother and friend." 
</p><p>
I hope my proceedings in these affairs will be satisfactory to your Honor, as I have, to the utmost of my 
knowledge, consulted the interest of the expedition and 
good of my country ; whose rights, while they are asserted in so just a cause, I will defend to the last 
remains of life. 
</p><p>
Hitherto the difficulties I have met with in marching 
have been greater, than I expect to encounter on the 
Ohio, when possibly I may be surrounded by the enemy, 
and these difficulties have been occasioned by those, 
who, had they acted as becomes every good subject, 
would have exerted their utmost abilities to forward our 
just designs. Out of seventy-four wagons impressed 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, we got but ten after waiting a week, 
and some of those so badly provided with teams, that 
the soldiers were obliged to assist them up the hills, 
although it was known they had better teams at home. 
I doubt not that in some points I may have strained the 
law; but I hope, as my sole motive was to expedite the 
march, I shall be supported in it, should my authority 
be questioned, which at present I do not apprehend, 
unless some busybody intermeddles. 
</p><p>
Your Honor will see by the resolves in council, that I 
am destined to the Monongahela with all the diligent despatch in my power. We will endeavour to make the 
road sufficiently good for the heaviest artillery to pass, 
and, when we arrive at Red-stone Creek, fortify ourselves as strongly as the short time will allow. I doubt 
not that we can maintain a possession there, till we are 
reinforced, unless the rising of the waters shall admit 
the enemy's cannon to be conveyed up in canoes, and 
then I flatter myself we shall not be so destitute of 
intelligence, as not to get timely notice of it, and make 
a good retreat. 
</p><p>
I hope you will see the absolute necessity for our 
having, as soon as our forces are collected, a number 
of cannon, some of heavy metal, with mortars and grenadoes to attack the French, and put us on an equal 
footing with them. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may also be thought advisable to invite 
the Cherokees, Catawbas, and Chickasaws to march to 
our assistance, as we are informed that six hundred 
Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down Scioto 
Creek to join the French, who are coming up the Ohio. 
In that case I would beg leave to recommend their 
being ordered to this place first, that a peace may be 
concluded between them and the Six Nations; for I am 
informed by several persons, that, as no good harmony 
subsists between them, their coming first to the Ohio 
may create great disorders, and turn out much to our 
disadvantage. 
</p><p>
As I had opportunities I wrote to the governors 
of Maryland and Pennsylvania, acquainting them with 
these advices, and enclosed the summons and Indian 
speech, which I hope you will not think me too forward 
in doing. I considered that the Assembly of Maryland 
was to sit in five days, that the Pennsylvania Assembly 
is now sitting, and that, by giving timely notice, something might be done in favor of this expedition, which 
now requires all the force we can muster. 
</p><p>
By the best information I can get, I much doubt whether any of the Indians will be in to treat in May. 
Are the Indian women and children, if they settle amongst us, to be maintained at our expense ? They 
will expect it. I have the honor to be, &LC. 
</p>
