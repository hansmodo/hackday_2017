DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since you first left this country, I have been favored 
with two letters from you ; one of them serving to enter 
your own, and the claims of Captains Stobo and Vanbraam, to part of the two hundred thousand acres of 
land, granted under Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation ; and the other, of the 18th of December, which did 
not come to my hands till about the first of last month, 
urging the expediency of prosecuting our right to those lands with spirit. 
</p><p>
In respect to the first, I have only to inform you, that 
your own claim, as well that for your brother as yourself, 
was entered before the receipt of your letter, and that 
Stobo's and Vanbraam's are also entered. In answer 
to the second, I can only add, that the same backwardness, which has ever appeared in our Honorable Board 
to recognise our right to these lands, seems still to prevail, and that our business in this affair is by no means 
in that forwardness, which I could wish, owing, I believe 
I may say, to other causes, as well as to a lukewarmness 
in those from whom we seek redress. The unequal 
interest and dispersed situation of the claimants make a 
regular cooperation difficult. An undertaking of this 
kind cannot be conducted without a good deal of expense and trouble ; and the doubt of obtaining the lands, 
after the utmost efforts, is such, as to discourage the 
larger part of the claimants from lending assistance, 
whilst a few are obliged to wade through every difficulty, or relinquish every hope. 
</p><p>
In this state of things, and in behalf of those, who had 
contributed to the expense of exploring and surveying 
the lands, I petitioned the Governor and Council, that the amount of each man's share, according to his rank, 
should be ascertained, and each claimant suffered to designate and survey his portion separately, by which means 
every man would stand upon his own footing. This 
petition I thought so reasonable, and so consistent with 
every principle of common justice, to say nothing of the 
disadvantage of being forced into large tracts, and the 
manifest inconvenience of dividing them afterwards, that 
I conceived it could not possibly be rejected ; but to my 
great astonishment it was so, and we are now compelled 
to be at the expense of surveying our whole quantity in 
twenty surveys, and then each individual subjected to 
the charge of surveying his own separately. In this 
way we are doubly taxed, while the whole is held as a 
kind of joint interest, and no man knows his property, 
or can tell how or in what manner to dispose of it. In 
short, so many glaring obstacles opposed their mode of 
proceeding, that they did not even attempt to remove 
them, but contented themselves with putting the soldiers upon a worse footing, than the meanest individual 
in the community, rather than be thought to give a license for the pillaging of his Majesty's or the Proprietary lands, when it is a fact well known, and every age 
evinces it, that no country ever was or ever will be 
settled without some indulgence. What inducements 
have men to explore uninhabited wilds, but the prospect 
of getting good lands ? Would any man waste his time, 
expose his fortune, nay, life, in such a search, if he was 
to share the good' and the bad with those that come 
after him 1 Surely not. We have surveyed ten of the 
largest tracts we can find in the district allowed us, and 
have been able to get sixty thousand acres, and for this 
tract we have been obliged to go between two and 
three hundred miles below Fort Pitt, as the lands thereabouts are thought to be within the Pennsylvania government ; at least, they are surveyed under those rights, 
and held by such a number of individuals, that it was thought to be impolitic to engage in private disputes, 
whilst there appeared a gloomy prospect of getting any land at all. 
</p><p>
The claims, which have been presented to me, are 
now all given in, and the Governor and Council have 
determined, that each officer shall share according to the 
rank in which he entered the service, and that the land 
shall be distributed in the following manner, namely, 
to each field-officer fifteen thousand acres, to each 
captain nine thousand, to each subaltern six thousand, to 
the cadets two thousand five hundred each, six hundred 
to a sergeant, five hundred to a corporal, and four hundred to each private soldier. They have made a reserve of thirty thousand acres, as well to provide for any 
claims, which may hereafter come in, as to compensate 
those, who have been and must necessarily continue to 
be saddled with the expense, which we find will not be 
very inconsiderable, as we have already expended near 
two hundred pounds, and the surveyor not yet paid.
