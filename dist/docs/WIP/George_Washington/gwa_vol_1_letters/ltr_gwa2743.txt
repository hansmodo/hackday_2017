DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am going to give you a little trouble, because I am 
persuaded you will excuse it. No good reason, you 
will say ; but it 'is the best I can offer for such a liberty. 
</p><p>
Interested as well as political motives render it necessary for me to seat the lands, which I have patented on 
the Ohio, in the cheapest, most expeditious, and effectual manner. Many expedients have been proposed to 
accomplish this, but none, in my judgment, so likely to 
succeed as the importing of Palatines. But how to do 
this upon the best terms, is a question I wish to have 
answered. Few of this kind of people ever come to 
Virginia, whether because it is out of the common course 
of its trade, or because they object to it, I am unable to 
determine. I shall take it very kind in you, therefore, to 
resolve the following questions, which I am persuaded 
you can do with precision, by inquiring of such gentlemen, as have been engaged in this business. 
</p><p>
Whether there is any difficulty in procuring these 
people in Holland? If so, from whence does it proceed 1 Whether they are to be had at all times, or at 
particular seasons only, and when 1 Whether they are 
engaged previously to sending for them, and in what 
manner ? Or do ships take their chance after getting 
there ? Upon what terms are they generally engaged ? 
And how much for each person do they commonly 
stand the importer landed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. ? Is it custernary to send an intelligent German in the ship, that 
is to bring them ? Do vessels ever go immediately to 
Holland for them, and, if they do, what cargoes do they 
carry? Or are they to go round, and where? In 
short, what plan would be recommended to me, by the 
knowing ones, as best for importing a full freight, say 
two or three hundred or more, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> ? In case 
of full freight, how are the numbers generally proportioned to the tonnage of a vessel ? 
</p><p>
Your favor in answering these several queries, with 
any other information, which you may think necessary 
for me to be possessed of, I shall gratefully receive, as I 
am totally unacquainted with every thing of the kind. 
</p><p>
I hope, though you have removed from this part of 
the world, that you do not mean to forsake us altogether, 
and that it is unnecessary to add, that I shall at all times 
be happy in seeing you at this place. My best respects 
attend your good father, sisters, and brothers ; and, with 
very sincere regard, I remain, dear Sir, &c. 
</p>
