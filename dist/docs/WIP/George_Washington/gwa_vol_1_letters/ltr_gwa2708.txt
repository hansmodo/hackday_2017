<p>
TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, 30 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform you, that, upon reviewing the 
six companies of my regiment at this place, which had 
been separated from me since my last, I found them deficient in the necessaries contained in the enclosed 
return. I am, therefore, under the duty of providing for 
them, or more properly of endeavouring to do it, as I doubt very much the possibility of succeeding. You 
will not, I hope, be surprised, should I draw on you for the amount. 
</p><p>
Governor Sharpe in person commanded a garrison of 
militia, from his province, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, when 
the magazine was blown up. 
</p><p>
My march to this post gave me an opportunity ot 
forming a judgment of the road, and I can truly say, 
that it is indescribably bad. Had it not been for an 
accidental discovery of a new passage over the Laurel 
Hill, the carriages must inevitably have stopped on the 
other side. This fact nobody here takes upon him to 
deny. The General and great part of the troops being 
yet behind, and the weather growing very inclement, I 
apprehend our expedition must terminate for this year 
at this place. But as our affairs are now drawing to a 
crisis, and a good or bad conclusion of them will shortly 
ensue, I choose to suspend my judgment, as well as a 
further account of the matter, to a future day.
</p><p>
November 5th. The General being arrived, with 
most of the artillery and troops, we expect to move 
forward in a very few days, encountering every hardship, 
that an advanced season, want of clothes, and a small 
stock of provisions will expose us to. But it is no 
longer a time for pointing out difficulties, and I hope my 
next will run in a more agreeable strain. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to assure your Honor, that, with very 
great respect, I am, &c. 
</p>
