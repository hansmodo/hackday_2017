TO FRANCIS DANDRIDGE, LONDON.

SIR, 
</p><p>
You will permit me, after six years' silence (the time 
I have been married to your niece), to pay my respects 
to you in this epistolary way. I shall think myself 
happy in beginning a correspondence, which cannot but 
be attended with pleasure on my side. 
</p><p>
I should hardly have taken the liberty, Sir, of introducing myself to your acquaintance in this manner, had 
not a letter from Mr. Robert Gary given me reasons to 
believe, that such an advance on my part would not be 
altogether disagreeable to you. If I could flatter myself, that you would in anywise be entertained with the 
few occurrences, that it may be in my power to relate, 
I should endeavour to atone for my past remissness, in 
this respect, by future punctuality. 
</p><p>
At present there are few things among us, that can 
be interesting to you. The Stamp Act, imposed on the 
colonies by the Parliament of Great Britain, engrosses 
the conversation of the speculative part of the colonists, 
who look upon this unconstitutional method of taxation, 
as a direful attack upon their liberties, and loudly exclaim against the violation. What may be the result of 
this, and of some other (I think I may add ill-judged) 
measures, I will not undertake to determine ; but this I 
may venture to affirm, that the advantage accruing to 
the mother country will fall greatly short of the expectations of the ministry ; for certain it is, that our whole 
substance already in a manner flows to Great Britain, 
and that whatsoever contributes to lessen our importations must be hurtful to her manufacturers. The eyes 
of our people already begin to be opened ; and they will 
perceive, that many luxuries, for which we lavish our 
substance in Great Britain, can well be dispensed with, 
whilst the necessaries of life are mostly to be had within 
ourselves. This, consequently, will introduce frugality, 
and be a necessary incitement to industry. If Great 
Britain, therefore, loads her manufactures with heavy 
taxes, will it not facilitate such results ? They will not 
compel us, I think, to give our money for their exports, 
whether we will or not ; and I am certain, that none of 
their traders will part with them without a valuable 
consideration. Where, then, is the utility of these restrictions 1 
</p><p>
As to the Stamp Act, regarded in a single view, one 
and the first bad consequence attending it, is, that our 
courts of judicature must inevitably be shut up ; for it is 
impossible, or next to impossible, under our present circumstances, that the act of Parliament can be complied 
with, were we ever so willing to enforce its execution. 
And, not to say (which alone would be sufficient) that 
we have not money to pay for the stamps, there are 
many other cogent reasons, which prove that it would 
be ineffectual. If a stop be put to our judicial proceedings, I fancy the merchants of Great Britain, trading to 
the colonies, will not be among the last to wish for a repeal of the act. 
</p><p>
I live on the Potomac River in Fairfax county, about 
ten miles below <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and many miles distant 
from any of my wife's relations, who all reside upon 
York River, and whom we seldom see more than once 
a year, and not always so often. My wife, who is very 
well, and Master and Miss Custis, children of her former 
marriage, all join in making a tender of their duty and 
best respects to yourself and your lady. My compliments to her, also, I beg may be made acceptable, and 
that you will do me the justice to believe that I am, dear 
Sir, your most obedient humble servant.
