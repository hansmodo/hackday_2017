</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The arrival of a good deal of company (among whom is my mother, alarmed at the report of my intention to attend your fortunes,) deprives me of the pleasure of 
waiting upon you to-day, as I had designed. I therefore beg, that you will be kind enough to make my compliments and excuse to the General, who I hope to hear 
is greatly recovered from his indisposition, and recruited sufficiently to prosecute his journey to Annapolis.
</p><p>
I find myself much embarrassed with my affairs, having no person in whom I can confide, to entrust the management of them with. Notwithstanding, I am determined to do myself the honor of accompanying you, 
upon this proviso, that the General will be kind enough to permit my return, as soon as the active part of the campaign is at an end, if it is desired ; or, if there should be a space of inaction, long enough to admit a visit to my home, that I may be indulged in coming to it. 
</p><p>
I need not add, how much I should be obliged by joining you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, instead of doing it at an earlier period.
</p><p>
These things, Sir, in whatever light they may appear to you at first sight, will not, I hope, be thought unreasonable, when it is considered how unprepared I am to 
quit a family, and an estate I was just about to settle, 
which is in the utmost confusion. 
</p><p>
I enclose a letter from Colonel Fairfax to Governor Shirley, which, with his compliments, he desired might 
be given to that gentleman. He also sends his blessing to you. At present he entertains sanguine hopes of you; this for your comfort. 
</p><p>
I herewith send you a small map of the back country, which, though imperfect and roughly drawn, for want of proper instruments, may give you a better knowledge of the designated parts, than you have hitherto had an opportunity of acquiring. 
</p><p>
I shall do myself the honor of waiting upon the General, as soon as I hear of his return from Annapolis. My compliments attend him, and Mr. Shirley. I am, &c. 
</p>
