TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 16 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter of the 14th instant, at 
eleven o'clock last night. The express, who brought it, 
informs me, that he was twice fired upon by Indians, 
and was obliged to abandon his horse to save himself. 
</p><p>
Three parties have gone hence towards the enemy within these few days past. The largest of them, consisting of an officer and eighteen Cherokees, marched three days ago. I always send some white men with the Indians, and will, to-day or to-morrow, send an officer and a greater number of white men with another party of Cherokees, because you desire it ; although, I 
must confess, it is my opinion, that small parties of Indians will more effectually harass the enemy, by keeping them under continual alarms, than any parties of 
white men can do. For small parties of the latter are not equal to the task, not being so dexterous at skulking as Indians ; and large parties will be discovered by their 
spies early enough to have a superior force opposed to them. Hence, in either case, there would be a great 
probability of losing many of our best men, and wearing down the rest, before the more essential services of the 
campaign would be entered upon, and this, I am afraid, without answering the proposed end. 
</p><p>
You are pleased to ask my opinion of the propriety 
of making an irruption into the enemy's country with 
a strong party. Such an enterprise, Sir, at this juncture, when we may suppose the enemy have collected, 
or are collecting, their whole force at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, 
would require a formidable detachment, the supplying 
of which with provisions would be too difficult and cumbersome to be effected undiscovered, as the enemy's 
parties are continually watching our motions. It is 
more than likely, therefore, that the enterprise would 
terminate in a miscarriage, if not in the destruction of 
the party. I should think it more eligible to defer such 
an attempt, until the army approaches more nearly to 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
I shall direct the officer, that marches out, to take 
particular pains in reconnoitring General Braddock's 
road, though I have had repeated information, that it 
only wants such small repairs, as could with ease be 
made as fast as the army would march. It is impossible 
for me to send out any men to repair it, as I have no 
tools for that purpose. If we had tools, and should go 
upon this road, the second company of artificers w r ould 
no doubt be wanted here ; but, as it is, I imagine they 
will be better employed with you. 
</p><p>
The misbehaviour of the Indians at your camp gives 
me great concern. If they were hearty in our interest, 
their services would be infinitely valuable. The best 
white men are not equal to them in the woods. But I 
fear they are too sensible of their own importance to 
render us much service. 
</p><p>
As the par of exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania is, by the laws of the two provinces, fixed at 
twenty-five per cent in favor of the former, I apprehend 
we can have no right to settle it on any other footing ; 
especially as any material deviation might be productiv< 
of very bad consequences. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, the warriors of the party oi 
Cherokees insisted upon marching instantly, and that 
but one white man should go. They are gone, and I 
have given the white man the necessary orders relative 
to the road. 
</p><p>
I am, with great sincerity, Sir, your most obedient 
servant. 
</p>
