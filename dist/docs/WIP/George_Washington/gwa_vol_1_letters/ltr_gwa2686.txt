TO COLONEL STANWIX. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 4 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
MY DEAR COLONEL, 
</p><p>
Your two favors, with the extract of a letter from Lord Loudoun, were this day delivered to me. In the 
latter you condescend to ask my opinion of Major Smith. Pray, does not his plan sufficiently indicate the 
man ? Can there be a better index to his abilities, than his scheme for reducing the enemy on the Ohio, and his 
expeditious march of a thousand men to Detroit? Surely, he intended to provide them with wings to facilitate their 
passage over so mountainous and extensive a country, or in what way else could he accomplish it? 
</p><p>
I am unacquainted with the navigation of the rivers he proposes to traverse, and, consequently, cannot be a 
competent judge of his scheme in this respect ; but the distance is so great, and that through an enemy's country, that, I candidly confess, it appears to me a romantic 
plan, not to be executed. For, if we are strong enough to attempt the reduction of the Ohio, what necessity is 
there for our making such a circuitous march, and leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> behind us, which is the source of all 
our ills? If we are too weak to attempt that place, what have we not to dread from leaving it in our rear ? 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are my sentiments upon Major Smith's 
project. With regard to the person, if I have been 
rightly informed, he actually had a commission to command a ranging company, and obtained it by making 
promises, which he never could comply with. He was 
adjudged, by persons better acquainted with him than I 
am, to be quite unfit to command even a company. He 
lost the Block-House, in which he commanded, by suffering his men to straggle from it at pleasure, which the 
Indians observing, took advantage of his weakness, and attacked him at a time when he had no men in his 
works. It is, nevertheless, agreed on all hands, that he made a gallant defence, but I never before heard of any 
capitulation that was granted to him. 
</p><p>
I have not had the pleasure of seeing Major Smith, 
though I have been favored with a letter from him, in 
which he politely professes some concern at hearing 
of my indisposition, as it prevented him from seeing me 
at Winchester ; but he desires, at the same time, that I 
will attend him at his house in Augusta, about two hundred miles off, or in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> by the 20th instant, 
when, I suppose, he intends to honor me with Ms orders.
</p><p>
I have never been able to return to my command, 
since I wrote to you last, my disorder at times returning 
obstinately upon me, in spite of the efforts of all the sons 
of jEsculapius, whom I have hitherto consulted. At 
certain periods I have been reduced to great extremity, 
and have now too much reason to apprehend an approaching decay, being visited with several symptoms of such a disease. 
</p><p>
I am at this time under' a strict regimen, and shall set 
out to-morrow for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> to receive the advice of 
the best physicians there. My constitution is much impaired, and nothing can retrieve it, but the greatest care 
and the most circumspect course of life. This being 
the case, as I have now no prospect left of preferment 
in the military way, and despair of rendering that immediate service, which my country may require from the 
person commanding its troops, I have thoughts of quitting my command, and retiring from all public business, 
leaving my post to be filled by some other person more capable of the task, and who may, perhaps, have his endeavours crowned with better success than mine have 
been. But, wherever I go, or whatever becomes of me, I shall always retain the sincerest and most affectionate 
regards for you; being, dear Sir, your most obedient and obliged humble servant
</p>
