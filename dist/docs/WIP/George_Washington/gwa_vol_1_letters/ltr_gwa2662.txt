<p>
TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM BRONAUGH, ON THE SOUTH BRANCH. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 17 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You are strictly required, immediately upon receipt 
of this, to transmit your provisions and stores to Captain Waggener's Fort, and there leave them. Then 
march your company to Pearsall's, in order to escort a quantity of flour to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, where you and 
your whole company are to remain. 
</p><p>
I expect you will pay due regard to this order, and 
put it in execution with the utmost alacrity, as it is in 
consequence of express directions from the Governor 
and Council. I heartily commiserate the poor, unhappy 
inhabitants, left by this means exposed to every incursion of a merciless enemy, and I wish it were in my 
power to offer them better support, than good wishes 
will afford. You may assure the settlement, that this 
unexpected, and, if I may be allowed to say it, unavoidable step was taken without my concurrence or knowledge ; that it is an express order from the Governor, 
and can neither be evaded nor delayed. Therefore, 
any representations to me of their danger, and the necessity of continuing troops among them, will be fruitless ; for, as I before observed, I have inclination, but 
no power left, to serve them. It is also the Governor's 
order, that the forts be left standing for the inhabitants 
to possess if they think proper.  
</p><p>
I am, Sir, yours, &c. 
</p>
