<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 2 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
When I wrote to 'you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, I expected to 
have been at or near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> by this time; 
but, upon coming here, and expecting wagons and provisions in readiness to go up with this escort, 1 received 
the enclosed from the commissary, which I send to 
evince that no delays or protracting of orders proceed 
from me. The return of our strength, which I called in as soon as I arrived, is herewith sent, signed by the 
adjutant, amounting, exclusive of the drafts, to eightyone effectives, including the sick, and young drummers, 
who were sent here to learn. 
</p><p>
When Captain Mercer went down, our strength consisted of about twenty-five more, including drafts, who 
have been sent over, since the middle of October, to 
Conococheague and Swearingham's Ferry, to encourage 
the inhabitants there to stay at their places, who otherwise were determined to forsake them. Your late and 
unexpected order has caused the utmost terror and 
consternation in the people, and will, I fear, be productive of numberless evils, not only to this place, and the 
public works erecting here, but to the people in general, 
who seem to be in the greatest dread of the consequences. The stores of every kind have all been 
brought from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, save those indispensably necessary there, at a very great expense, and lie 
in the court-house and other public buildings, to the no 
small inconvenience and detriment of the county. I 
have frequently been importuned by the members of 
the court, and other public officers, to remove them, and 
have as often by gentle persuasives protracted the time ; 
which was the more cheerfully granted, as it was evident there were no other places to receive them, and 
that I strove with the utmost diligence to prepare the 
proper receptacles. What course to take now, I know 
not, and hope you will direct. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, were you informed how much this 
place (which is in every respect our extreme and 
most exposed frontier, there being no inhabitants between this and the South Branch, and none there but 
such as are forted in,) I say, I am convinced, if you 
were truly informed of the situation of this place, of its 
importance and danger, you would not think it prudent 
to leave such a quantity of valuable stores exposed to 
the insults of a few ; for a very few indeed might reduce 
them and the town to ashes. In the next place, as I 
observed in my last letter, the works, which have been 
begun and continued with labor and hardship, lie open, 
untenable, and exposed to the weather, to say no more ; 
the materials, which have been collected with cost and 
infinite difficulty, will be at the mercy of every pillager ; 
our timber and scantling, used and burnt by the town's 
people ; our plank, which has been brought from afar, 
stolen and destroyed ; and the lime, if not stolen, left to 
be wasted. And this is not the worst. A building, 
which in time might and would have been very strong 
and defensible, and an asylum in the greatest danger, 
must be in a manner totally abandoned. As the case 
now stands, we have no place tenable, no place of 
safety ; all is exposed and open to attacks ; and by not 
having a garrison kept at this place, no convoys can get 
up to us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and the communication 
with the inhabitants is entirely cut off, so that soldiers 
and inhabitants cannot assist each other. 
</p><p>
In regard to my residing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I shall 
lay before you such inconveniences as must unavoidably arise, while we pursue these defensive measures ; 
in doing which, I think I only do my duty. First, as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> lies more advanced, and wide of all 
other forts, I shall be prevented from having the immediate direction of any but that. Secondly, the stores 
being at this place, and I at that, it will be impossible to 
deliver them regularly. I must either trust to a subaltern officer to order them discretionally, or else an 
express must be first sent to me, and then I must send 
to the storekeeper to deliver the necessaries wanted for 
each garrison. Moreover, there is no travelling to Fort 
Cumberland without endangering life, except with a 
pretty strong escort. Thirdly, by being at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> a total stagnation of business must ensue, because money is lodged with me for discharging all 
contingent expenses arising in the service, and no persons will, or can, come to me there. Consequently 
they will be slack in furnishing us with wagons and 
necessaries of every kind, which now by due payment 
may be had at call. Lastly, Winchester is in the centre, as it were, of all the forts, and is convenient for 
receiving intelligence and distributing orders. It also 
lies in a vale of land, that has suffered more than any 
other from the incursions of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I hope, after receiving a peremptory order, the mentioning of these things will not appear presuming or 
odd. I do not hesitate a moment to obey. On the 
contrary, I shall comply as soon as I can. I mean 
nothing more than to point out the consequences, that 
must necessarily attend this step, as I apprehend you 
were not thoroughly apprised of our situation. Some, 
Sir, who are inclined to put an unfavorable construction 
on this ingenuous recital, may say, that I am loath to 
leave Winchester. I declare, upon my honor, I am not, 
but had rather a thousand times be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
if I could do the duty there. I am tired of this place, 
the inhabitants, and the life I lead here ; and if, after 
what I have said, you should think it necessary for me 
to reside at that fort, I shall acquiesce with pleasure and 
cheerfulness, and be freed from much anxiety, plague, 
and business. To be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> sometimes, I 
think highly expedient, and have hitherto done it. 
Three weeks ago I came from that place. 
</p><p>
I have used every endeavour to detain drafts, but all 
in vain. They are home-sick and tired of work. They 
all declare, that, if an expedition is conducted in the 
spring, they will serve two, three, or four months ; but 
these are words of course. The Catawbas are out on 
the scout with an officer and some men of ours. They 
proposed, when I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, to stay only 
one moon, and then to set out for their nation, with a 
report of the country and its convenience to the enemy, 
(but rather with a report of our usage, I believe.) It 
therefore behoves us to reward them well, and keep 
them in temper. They applied to me for several necessaries, such as a suit of clothes for each, wampum, pipes, 
tomahawks, and silver trinkets for the wrists and arms. 
The wampum and tomahawks I have purchased. The 
want of the other articles may occasion somte murmuring, and there are very few things suitable at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. They seemed desirous, that an officer should 
return with them, and gave strong assurances of his 
bringing in a number. If you approve it, I shall endeavour to fix upon some officer, that falls most within 
their customs, and send him upon this duty. The Indians expect to be sent back upon horses. Do you 
approve that they should 1 I will not take upon me to 
buy horses without your orders. The Cherokees are 
not yet arrived, nor the arms from Augusta. 
</p><p>
I am your Honor's, &,c.
