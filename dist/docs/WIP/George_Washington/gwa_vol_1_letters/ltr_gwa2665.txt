<p>
TO THE EARL OF LOUDOUN. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
The posture of affairs in this quarter is really melancholy, and the prospect was rendered more gloomy 
while there appeared no hopes of amendment; but, 
from the presence of your Lordship at this time in the 
Dominion, we conceive hopes of seeing these threaten 
ing clouds dispelled. 
</p><p>
The sums of money, which have been granted by this 
colony to carry on the war, have been very considerable ; and to reflect to what little purpose is matter of 
great concern, and will seem surprising to those, who 
are not acquainted with the causes, and the confusion 
with which all our affairs have hitherto been conducted, 
owing to our having no fixed object, nor pursuing any 
regular system, or plan of operation. 
</p><p>
As I have studied with attention and care the nature 
of the service, have been myself engaged in it from the 
beginning of the present broils, and an eyewitness to all 
the movements and various proceedings, I beg leave to 
offer a concise and candid account of our circumstances in their resolution, without alleging any other reason, than that it was in 
pursuance of Lord Loudoun's desire. 
</p><p>
It was not ascertained until too late, that the French 
were on the Ohio; or rather, that we could be persuaded they came there with a design to invade his 
Majesty's dominions. Nay, after I was sent out in December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1753">1753</a>, and brought undoubted testimony even 
from themselves of their avowed design, it was yet 
thought a fiction, and a scheme to promote the interest 
of a private company, even by some who had a share in 
the government. These unfavorable surmises caused 
great delays in raising the first men and money, and 
gave the active enemy time to take possession of the 
Fork of the Ohio (which they now call Duquesne), before we were in sufficient strength to advance thither, 
which has been the chief source of all our past and 
present misfortunes. For by this means, as the French 
got between us and our Indian allies, they fixed those 
in their interests, who were wavering, and obliged the 
others to neutrality, till the unhappy defeat of General 
Braddock. 
</p><p>
The troops under Colonel Dunbar going into quarters 
in July, the inactivity of the neighbouring colonies, and 
the incapacity of this, conspired to give the French 
great room to exult, and the Indians little reason to expect a vigorous offensive war on our side, and induced 
the defensive plan, which promised the greatest show 
of protection. This is an undeniable fact, as well as that 
all the Indians did not forsake the English interests, till 
three months after the battle of Monongahela, but actually waited to see what measures would be concerted 
to regain our losses, and afford them the protection we 
had but too liberally promised. 
</p><p>
Virginia, it is true, was not inactive all this time. On 
the contrary, she voted a handsome supply for raising men to carry on the war, or, more properly, to defend 
herself; matters being reduced to this extremity for 
want of assistance. But even in this she signally failed, 
and, as I apprehend, from the following causes. 
</p><p>
The men first levied to repel the enemy marched for 
the Ohio in the beginning of April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, without tents, 
without clothes, in short, without any conveniences to 
shelter them, in that remarkably cold and wet season, 
from the inclemency of the weather, or to make the 
service tolerably agreeable. In this state did they continue, notwithstanding, till the battle of the Meadows, in 
July following, never receiving in all that space any subsistence ; and they were very often under the greatest 
straits and difficulties for want of provisions. 
</p><p>
These things were productive of great murnrurings 
and discontent, and rendered the service so distasteful 
to the men, that, not being paid immediately upon coming in, they thought themselves bubbled, and that no 
reward for their services was ever intended. This 
caused desertion ; and the deserters, spreading over the 
country, recounting their sufferings and want of pay, 
which rags and poverty sufficiently testified, fixed in 
the mind of the populace such horrid impressions of the 
hardships they had encountered, that no arguments 
could remove these prejudices, or facilitate the recruiting service. 
</p><p>
This put the Assembly upon enacting a law to impress vagrants, which added to our difficulties, for, as 
these abandoned miscreants were compelled into the 
service, they embraced every opportunity to effect their 
escape, gave a loose to their vicious principles, and invented the most unheard-of stories to palliate desertion 
and gain compassion ; in which they not only succeeded, 
but obtained protection likewise. So that it was next 
to impossible, after this, to apprehend deserters, while 
the civil officers rather connived at their escape, than 
aided in securing them. 
</p><p>
Thus were affairs situated, when we were ordered, 
in September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>, to recruit our force to twelve hundred men. It is easy to conceive, under "these circumstances, why we did not fulfil the order, especially when 
the officers had not a sufficient allowance for this arduous task. We continued, however, using our endeavours 
until March following, without much success. 
</p><p>
The Assembly, meeting about that time, came to a 
resolution of augmenting our numbers to fifteen hundred 
men, by drafting the militia, who were to continue in 
the service until December only. By reason of a clause 
in the act exempting all those, who should pay ten 
pounds, our numbers were very little increased, one 
part of the people paying that sum, and many of the 
poorer sort absconding. This was not the only pernicious clause, for the funds arising from these forfeitures 
were thrown into the treasury ; whereas, had they been 
deposited in proper hands for recruiting, the money 
might have turned to good account. But a greater 
grievance still was the restraining of the forces from 
marching out of the colony, or acting offensively, and 
ordering them to build forts, and garrison them, along a 
frontier of more than three hundred miles in extent. 
How far they, or any like number, are equal to such a 
task, and how repugnant a defensive plan is to the true 
interest and welfare of the colony, I submit to any one 
to determine who will consider the following particulars. 
</p><p>
First, that erecting forts at greater distances than fifteen or eighteen miles, or a day's march asunder, and 
garrisoning them with less than eighty or a hundred 
men each, is not answering the intention ; because, if 
they are at a greater distance from each other, it is inconvenient for the soldiers to scout between them, and 
it gives the enemy full scope to make incursions without 
being discovered, until they have fallen on the inhabitants and committed ravages. And, after they are discovered, the time required, in assembling troops from 
forts more distant, prevents a pursuit being made in 
time, and allows the enemy to escape without danger 
into a country so mountainous and full of swamps and 
hollow ways covered with woods. Then, if garrisoned 
with less than eighty or a hundred men, the number is 
too small to afford detachments, that are not very liable 
to be cut off by the enemy, whose numbers in this close 
country can scarcely be known till they are proved. Indian parties are generally intermixed with some French, 
and are so dexterous at skulking, that their spies, lying 
about these small forts for some days and taking a prisoner, make certain discoveries of the strength of the garrison ; and then, upon observing a scouting party coming 
out, they will first cut it off, and afterwards attempt the 
fort. Instances of this have lately happened. 
</p><p>
Secondly, our frontiers are of such extent, that if the 
enemy were to make a formidable attack on one side, 
before the troops on the other could give assistance, 
they might overrun the country ; and it is not improbable, if they had a design on one part, that they would 
make a feint on the other. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the cost to the country in building these 
forts, and removing stores and provisions into them. 
</p><p>
Fourthly, where and when will this expense end? 
We may be assured, if we do not endeavour to remove 
the cause, w r e shall be as liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now ; indeed more so. Because, 
if the French are allowed to possess those lands in 
peace, they will have the entire command of the Indians, 
and grow stronger in their alliance ; while we, by our 
defensive schemes and pusillanimous behaviour, shall exhaust our treasury, reduce our strength, and become 
the contempt of these savage nations, who are every day 
enriching themselves with the plunder and spoils of our people. 
</p><p>
It will evidently appear from the whole tenor of nr 
conduct, but more especially from reiterated representations, how strongly I have urged the Governor and 
Assembly to pursue different measures, and tried to 
convince them, by all the reasonings I could offer, of the 
impossibility of covering so extensive a frontier from Indian incursions, without more force than Virginia can 
maintain. I have endeavoured to demonstrate, that it 
would require fewer men to remove the cause, than to 
prevent the effects, while the cause subsists. This, 
notwithstanding, as I before observed, was the measure 
adopted, and the plan under which we have acted for 
eight months past, with the disagreeable reflection of 
doing no essential service to our country, nor gaining 
honor to ourselves, or reputation to our regiment. However, under these disadvantageous restraints I must beg 
leave to say, that the regiment has not been inactive ; 
on the contrary, it has performed a vast deal of work, 
and has been very alert in defending the people. This 
will appear from the fact, that, notwithstanding we are 
more contiguous to the French and their Indian allies, 
and more exposed to their frequent incursions, than any 
of the neighbouring colonies, yet we have not lost half 
the number of inhabitants, that others have done, but 
considerably more soldiers in their defence. In the 
course of this campaign (since March, I mean, as we 
have had but one constant campaign, and one continued 
scene of action, from the time we first entered the service), our troops have been engaged in upwards of 
twenty skirmishes, and we have had near a hundred 
men killed and wounded. From a small regiment dispersed over the country, and acting upon the defensive, 
as ours does by order, this, I conceive, will not appear 
inconsiderable to those, who are in the least degree acquainted with the nature of this service, and the posture 
of our affairs ; however it may seem to chimney-corner 
politicians, thirsting for news, and expecting by every 
express to hear in what manner <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> is taken, 
and the garrison led away captive by our small numbers ; although we are restrained from making the attempt, were our hopes of success ever so rational. 
</p><p>
The next points, which I shall beg leave to mention, are our military laws and regulations. 
</p><p>
The first men raised, if I rightly remember, were under no law ; if any, the militia law, which was next of 
kin to none. Under this we remained a short time, 
and, by instilling the idea into the soldiers, who knew 
no better, that they were governed by the articles of 
war, we felt little inconvenience. The next campaign 
we were joined by the regulars, and made subject to 
their laws. After the regulars left us, the Assembly, as 
I before mentioned, passed an act in September following to raise twelve hundred men, and, in order I suppose to improve upon the act of Parliament, prepared a 
military code of their own, but such a one as could preserve no military discipline while it existed. This being 
represented by the most pressing and repeated remonstrances, the Assembly were induced to pass a bill in 
October following, for one year only, fixing the penalty 
of death for mutiny and desertion. But they took no 
cognizance of many other crimes, equally punishable 
by act of Parliament. So that no officer, or soldier, 
accused of cowardice, holding correspondence with the 
enemy, quitting a post, or sleeping upon it, and many 
other crimes of a capital dye, or pernicious tendency, 
could be legally tried. Neither was there any provision made for quartering or billeting soldiers, impressing wagons, and the like. 
</p><p>
But that which contributed the most towards rendering this law inconvenient and absurd, and at the same 
time to demonstrate that the Assembly fully intended to 
prevent any enterprise of their troops out of the colony, 
was a clause forbidding any courts -martial to sit out of 
it ; by which means all proceedings held at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> (in Maryland) were illegal, and we were obliged 
to remove to Virginia for the trial of offenders, or act 
contrary to law, and be open to prosecution. How 
then were we to behave upon a march of perhaps fifty, 
eighty, or a hundred miles beyond? These circumstances concurring to render the law ineffectual, induced me again to recommend an amendment, which 
I did with all the force and energy of argument I was 
master of. But no regard has hitherto been paid to my 
remonstrances. To what cause it is owing, I know not, 
unless to short sittings and hurry of business ; for I can 
conceive of no reason, why the Assembly should be against instituting rules for the regulation of their forces, 
of which long experience in established armies has fully 
evinced the necessity. But, to cut short the account, 
we are under no government at all, properly speaking. 
Indeed, there is a jumble of laws that have little meaning or design in them, but to make the command intricate, and to prevent offence to the civil powers, who 
are tenacious of liberty, and prone to censure and condemn all proceedings not strictly according to the law, 
not considering what cases may arise to render them necessary. 
</p><p>
Another grievance, to which this act subjects us, is 
the method prescribed to pay for deserters. Many 
of our deserters are apprehended in Maryland and 
Pennsylvania, and, for the sake of the reward, are 
brought to the regiment. But, instead of the reward, 
the persons thus bringing them in receive a certificate 
only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds of 
tobacco. This certificate is to be presented to a Court 
of Claims, and they refer it to the Assembly. There it 
may perhaps remain two or three years before it is paid. 
This causes great dissatisfaction, and induces the illdisposed to aid, rather than prevent, the escape of 
soldiers. 
</p><p>
No regular provision is established for the maimed 
and wounded, which is discouraging, and grievously 
complained of. The soldiers justly observe, that the 
result of bravery is often a broken leg, arm, or incurable 
wound ; and when they are disabled, and no longer fit 
for service, they are discharged, and reduced to the necessity of begging from door to door, or of perishing 
through indigence. It is true, no instance of this kind 
has yet appeared. On the contrary, the Assembly have 
dealt generously by those unfortunate soldiers, who have 
met with this fate. But then, this provision is not yet established, nor in any manner compulsory, and a man 
may suffer in the interval of their sitting. 
</p><p>
After giving this short and true account of our military laws, and observing that even these, laws are now 
expired, I conceive there need but few -arguments to 
prove the difficulty of keeping soldiers under proper 
discipline, who know they are not punishable by law for 
the most atrocious crimes. How then is it to be wondered at, if mutiny, desertion, and all other irregularities 
should creep into a camp, or garrison, more, especially 
if we consider that hard duty, and want of clothes and 
of almost every necessary that renders a soldier's life 
comfortable and easy, are strong incentives, and, to 
go further, when these intolerable grievances are set to 
view in the most glaring point of light by a person, who, 
lost to all sense of honor and virtue, and building, I am 
sorry to say, upon a proclamation inviting the deserters 
from the Virginia Regiment to enlist into the Royal 
American Regiment, has made use of every artifice to 
represent the fatigues and hardships of our service, and 
the ease and conveniences of the other, to seduce them 
from their duty ? 
</p><p>
Want of clothing may be esteemed another principal 
grievance, which our soldiers have labored under. In 
the first twelve months of their service they received no 
clothing; but in March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, they were presented each 
with a suit made of thin, sleazy cloth without lining, and 
flannel waistcoats of an inferior sort. After that no 
others were sent for (although two pence stoppage was 
drawn from every man's pay, recruits npt excepted,) 
until repeated complaints and remonstrances from me, 
enforced in June last by a representation of many gentlemen of the Assembly, who had formed an association, 
and saw the disagreeable situation of the soldiers, induced the Committee, to whom those addresses were presented, to send for clothing. The clothes were to 
have been here by the middle of October, but no advice 
is received of them yet, which gives the soldiers some 
pretence to suspect they are deceived. It is to this irregular pay, and the causes aforementioned, that their 
late disobedience ought to be ascribed. For I can truly 
say, and confidently assert, that no soldiers ever were 
under better command than these were before. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may be asked, by gentlemen not thoroughly 
acquainted with the nature of our service, why the officers do not see that their men's pay is more properly 
applied ? In answer I must beg leave to observe, that, 
after the soldiers have appropriated a part for purchasing reasonable and tit necessaries, the remainder is 
barely sufficient to keep them in shoes, owing, in the 
first place, to the very great consumption the service occasions, and, in the next, to the exorbitant price, which 
this article bears. I have known a soldier go upon 
command with a new pair of shoes, which perhaps have 
cost him from seven shillings and sixpence to ten shillings, and return without any ; so much do they wear in 
wading creeks, fording rivers, and clambering mountains 
covered with rocks. 
</p><p>
As great a grievance as any I have mentioned is yet 
unnoticed, and that is the present regulation of the militia ; but a representation of this matter will come better 
and more properly from others. 
</p><p>
To point out all the causes, which combine to make 
our service infinitely hard and disagreeable, would swell 
these observations into a volume, and require time, and 
a more able pen than mine. But there are yet some 
things, that should be mentioned. 
</p><p>
An ill-judged economy is shown in raising men. We 
are either insensible of danger, till it breaks upon our 
heads, or else, through mistaken 'notions of economy, evade the expense, till the blow is struck, and then run 
into an extreme of raising militia. These, after an age, 
as it were, is spent in assembling them, come up, make 
a noise for a time, oppress the inhabitants, and then return, leaving the frontiers unguarded as before. And 
this plan is pursued, notwithstanding former experience 
convinces us, if reason did not, that the French and Indians are watching their opportunity, when we are lulled 
into fatal security, unprepared for resisting an attack, to 
muster their forces to invade the country. By ravaging 
one part they terrify another, and retreat when our militia assemble, but repeat the stroke as soon as they are 
dispersed, sending down parties in the interim to discover our motions, procure intelligence, and sometimes 
to divert our troops. Such an invasion we may expect 
in March, if measures to prevent it are neglected, as 
they hitherto have been. 
</p><p>
The want of tools occasions insurmountable difficulties in carrying on our works, either offensive or defensive. 
Cartridge-paper is an article not to be met with in Virginia. 
</p><p>
And now, before I conclude, I must beg leave to add, 
that my unwearied endeavours are inadequately rewarded. The orders I receive are full of ambiguity. I 
am left, like a wanderer in the wilderness, to proceed 
at hazard. I am answerable for consequences, and 
blamed, without the privilege of defence. This, my 
Lord, I beg leave to declare, is at present my situation. 
Therefore, it is not to be wondered at, if, under such 
peculiar circumstances, I should be sick of a service, 
which promises so little of a soldier's reward. I have 
long been satisfied of the impossibility of continuing 
in this service, without loss of honor. Indeed, I was 
fully convinced of it before I accepted the command the 
second time, seeing the cloudy prospect before me ; and I did for this reason reject the offer, until I was ashamed 
any longer to refuse, not caring to expose my character 
to public censure. The solicitations of the country 
overcame my objections, and induced me to accept it. 
</p><p>
Another reason has of late operated to continue me 
in the service until now, and that is, the dawn of hope 
that arose, when I heard your Lordship was destined 
by his Majesty for the important command of his armies 
in America, and appointed to the government of his dominion of Virginia. Hence it was, that I drew my 
hopes, and fondly pronounced your Lordship our patron. Although I had not the honor to be known to 
your Lordship, yet your name was familiar to my ear, 
on account of the important services rendered to his 
Majesty in other parts of the world. 
</p><p>
Ever since our defeat at the Meadows, and behaviour 
under General Braddock, we have been tantalized, nay, 
bid to expect most sanguinely a better establishment, 
and have waited in tedious expectation of seeing this 
accomplished. The Assembly, it is true, have, I believe, done every thing in their power to bring this 
about; first, by soliciting his Honor, the LieutenantGovernor, to address his Majesty; and next, by addressing his Majesty themselves in favor of their regiment. What success these addresses have met with, I am yet ignorant. With regard to myself, I cannot 
forbear adding, that, had General Braddock survived 
his unfortunate defeat, I should have met with preferment agreeable to my wishes. I had his promise to 
that purpose, and I believe that gentleman was too sincere and generous to make unmeaning offers, where no 
favors were asked. General Shirley was not unkind in 
his promises, but he has gone to England. 
</p><p>
I do not know, my Lord, in what light this short and 
disinterested relation may be received ; but it is offered with the utmost candor and submission. It contains no 
misrepresentations, nor aggravated statement of facts, nor unjust reflections. 
</p><p>
Virginia is a country young in war, and, till the breaking out of these disturbances, has remained in the most 
profound and tranquil peace, never studying war nor 
warfare. It is not, therefore, to be imagined, that she 
can fall into proper measures at once. All that can be 
expected at her hands she cheerfully offers, the 
sinews of war, and these only want your Lordship's 
ability and experience to be properly applied and directed. 
</p><p>
Finally, my Lord, how to apologize for assuming a 
freedom, which must at any rate give you trouble, I 
know not, unless an ardent zeal to serve my country, 
and a steady attachment to her interests, and to the 
honor of arms, shall plead an excuse, till I am so happy 
as to have an opportunity of testifying in person how 
much I admire your Lordship's character, and with 
what profound respect I have the honor to be, &c.
</p>
