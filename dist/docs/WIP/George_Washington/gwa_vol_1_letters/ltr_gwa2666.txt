TO RICHARD WASHINGTON, MERCHANT, LONDON.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After so long silence it may be expected, that I 
should introduce this letter with an apology for my 
seeming neglect. I own, Sir, it is necessary to urge 
something in my defence, and what can be so proper as 
the truth? 
</p><p>
I have been posted, then, for twenty months past 
upon our cold and barren frontiers, to perform, I think I 
may say, impossibilities ; that is, to protect from the cruel 
incursions of a crafty, savage enemy a line of inhabitants, 
of more than three hundred and fifty miles in extent, 
with a force inadequate to the task. By this means I 
am become in a manner an exile, and seldom informed 
of those opportunities, which I might otherwise embrace, 
of corresponding with my friends. 
</p><p>
Experience has convinced every thinking man in this 
colony, that we must bid adieu to peace and safety 
whilst' the French are allowed to possess the Ohio, and 
to practise their arts among the numerous tribes of Indian nations that inhabit those regions, and that it must 
be attended with an expense infinitely greater to defend 
our possessions, as they ought to be defended against 
the skulking enemy, than to remove the cause of our 
groundless fears, by the reduction of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
had no reason to expect a warm friend in the Governor of Virginia at the 
councils in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. He did not fail, therefore, to embrace the opportunity, reluctantly as it had been granted, of being present and attending 
personally to the interests of his regiment, and to affairs in which he was 
so deeply concerned. He was consulted by Lord Loudoun, in regard to 
the future disposition of the forces on the frontiers of the southern colonies. 
But after all, he was not successful in his wish to have the Virginia regiment put upon the same footing as the regular army, and to obtain King's 
commissions for himself and his officers. 
</p><p>
Yet, from what strange causes I know not, no attempt 
this season will be made, I fear, to destroy this hold of 
the barbarians, for they deserve no better name, who 
have become a terror to three populous colonies. Virginia may justly say, that she was always willing to furnish her full proportion of men and money for this 
desirable end; and, I think I may venture to affirm, 
that there never was, and I verily believe never will be, 
a more favorable time than the present for an enterprise 
Of this kind, while the enemy's troops are doubtless 
drawn off to the northward, to defend themselves at 
home against the more formidable attack of Lord Loudoun. 
</p><p>
I have now to add, that I am so little acquainted with 
the business relative to my private affairs, that I can 
scarce give you any information concerning it. I know 
that I ought to have some tobacco, and that it ought to 
be stripped. I have begged the favor of two persons to 
do this for me, and I desired them to write you in my 
behalf, and draw for sundry things, of which I am in 
want ; but whether any part or all of this has been done, 
I know not. I shall, therefore, desire these two things 
of you ; first, that you will put yourself to no real inconvenience in forwarding goods to a greater amount than 
my remittance, because I by no means intended to be 
troublesome, when I solicited your correspondence ; 
and, secondly, that whatever goods you may send 
me, where the prices are not absolutely limited, you 
will let them be fashionable, neat, and good in their several kinds. Enclosed is a list of sundries, which I 
should be glad to receive agreeably to these directions. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, 
Your affectionate friend, and obedient servant.
