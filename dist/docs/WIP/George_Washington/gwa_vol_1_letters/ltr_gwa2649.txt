<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 24 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Not an hour, nay scarcely a minute, passes, that doe 
not produce fresh alarms and melancholy accounts. 
Nor is it possible to give the people the necessary assistance for their defence, on account of the small number of men we have, or that are likely to be here for 
some time. The inhabitants are removing daily, and in 
a short time will leave this country as desolate as 
Hampshire, where scarce a family lives. 
</p><p>
Three families were murdered the night before last, 
at the distance of less than twelve miles from this place ; 
and every day we have accounts of such cruelties and 
barbarities, as are shocking to human nature. It is not 
possible to conceive the situation and danger of this 
miserable country. Such numbers of French and Indians are all around, that no road is safe ; and here we 
know not the hour when we may be attacked. 
</p><p>
As it is not in my power to give you a full account of 
every thing, I have sent Captain Peachey to wait upon 
you, who can be more ample and satisfactory in every 
point, that requires your notice. I have written for the 
militia of Fairfax, Prince William, and Culpeper, and 
expect them here in a very few days. But how they 
are to be supplied with ammunition and provisions, I am 
quite at a loss to know. The distance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> from us, where these supplies are, renders them 
useless, in a manner, and puts us to the greatest straits ; 
and as the inhabitants are leaving their farms, it will be 
impossible for the militia to subsist without a supply of 
provisions, which are now very scarce, and will be more 
so. I should therefore be glad if your Honor would 
send up arms, ammunition, and provisions, and give immediate orders for the Irish beef at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, which 
cannot be had without your consent. 
</p><p>
You spoke of sending some Indians to our assistance, 
in which no time should be lost, nor any means omitted 
to engage all the Catawbas and Cherokees, that can 
possibly be gathered, and immediately to despatch them 
hither. Unless we have Indians to oppose Indians, we 
may expect but small success. And I should think it 
no bad scheme, while the Indians remain here in such 
numbers, to have a detachment sent out with some 
friendly Indians to make an attempt upon the hostile 
towns, though this should be executed with all imaginable secrecy. 
</p><p>
I hear the Assembly is for augmenting the forces in 
pay to fifteen hundred only, which are far too few to 
defend the frontiers against so numerous an enemy. 
But I have often written you my sentiments upon this 
and other subjects, and shall not now enlarge. I have 
also written to the Speaker by Captain Peachey, who 
will, I imagine, communicate to you what demands your 
immediate regard. 
</p><p>
I wish your Honor would inform me, whether the 
militia expected here must be supplied out of the public 
stock of provisions laid up for the soldiers, or are to 
supply themselves. The want of due direction in matters of this nature causes great inconvenience. Give 
me leave to urge your speedy care in sending men and 
ammunition to our assistance, else the consequence may 
prove very fatal in a little time. 
</p><p>
I have been just now told, that numbers about the 
neighbourhood hold councils and cabals for very dishonorable purposes, and unworthy the thoughts of a 
British subject. Despairing of assistance and protection 
from below (as they foolishly conjecture), they talk of 
capitulating and agreeing upon terms with the French and Indians, rather than lose their lives and fortunes 
through obstinacy. My force, at present, is very weak, 
and unable to take the necessary measures, as to those 
suspected persons ; but, as soon as the militia arrive, be 
assured I will do my utmost to detect and secure such 
pests of society, if my information is not groundless, 
which I should be pleased to find so. 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of a council of war lately held here, 
and copies of some letters received since my last to you ; 
one of which, for Colonel Martin, has been just sent to 
me from Fort Hopewell, on the South Branch. They 
have had an engagement there, with the French and 
Indians, the particulars of which you will see by the enclosed. Captain Waggener, with a party of his men, 
joined them the next day, and went in pursuit of the 
enemy, but could not come up with them. The waters 
were so high, that although Captain Waggener heard 
them engaged, he could send them no assistance. From 
these and other circumstances, you may form but a 
faint idea of the wretched situation of this country, nor 
can it be adequately conceived. 
</p><p>
My extreme hurry, confusion, and anxiety must plead 
an excuse for incorrectness. I am your Honor's, &,c.
