DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 17th was not presented to me till 
after the resolutions, which were judged advisable for 
this county to adopt, had been revised, altered, and corrected in the committee ; nor till we had gone into a 
general meeting in the court-house, and my attention 
was necessarily called every moment to the business 
before us. I did, however, upon the receipt of it, in 
that hurry and bustle, hastily run it over, and I handed 
it round to the gentlemen on the bench, of whom there 
were many ; but, as no person present seemed in the 
least disposed to adopt your sentiments, as there appeared a perfect satisfaction and acquiescence in the 
measures proposed (except from Mr. Williamson, who 
was for adopting your advice literally, without obtaining 
a second voice on his side), and as the gentlemen, to 
whom the letter was shown, advised me not to have it 
read, as it was not likely to make a convert, and was 
repugnant, some of them thought, to every principle we 
were contending for, I forbore to offer it otherwise 
than in the manner abovementioned ; which I shall be 
sorry for, if it gives you any dissatisfaction that your 
sentiments were not read to the county at large, instead 
of being communicated to the first people in it, by offering them the letter in the manner I did. 
</p><p>
That I differ very widely from you, in respect to the mode of obtaining a repeal of the acts so much and so 
justly complained of, I shall not hesitate to acknowledge ; and that this difference in opinion probably proceeds 
from the different constructions we put upon the conduct and intention of the ministry may also be true ; but, 
as I see nothing, on the one hand, to induce a belief, that the Parliament would embrace a favorable opportunity of repealing acts, which they go on with great 
rapidity to pass, in order to enforce their tyrannical system ; and, on the other, I observe, or think I observe, 
that government is pursuing a regular plan at the expense of law and justice to overthrow our constitutional 
rights and liberties, how can I expect any redress from 
a measure, which has been ineffectually tried already ? 
For, Sir, what is it we are contending against? Is it 
against paying the duty of three pence per pound on 
tea because burthensome ? No, it is the right only, that 
we have all along disputed ; and to this end we have already petitioned his Majesty in as humble and dutiful a 
manner, as subjects could do. Nay, more, we applied 
to the House of Lords and House of Commons in their 
different legislative capacities, setting forth, that, as 
Englishmen, we could not be deprived of this essential 
and valuable part of our constitution. If, then, as the 
fact really is, it is against the right of taxation that we 
now do, and, as I before said, all along have contended, 
why should they suppose an exertion of this power 
would be less obnoxious now than formerly? And 
what reason have we to believe, that they would make 
a second attempt, whilst the same sentiments fill the breast of every American, if they did not intend to enforce it if possible ?
</p><p>
The conduct of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people could not justify 
the rigor of their measures, unless there had been a 
requisition of payment and refusal of it ; nor did that 
conduct require an act to deprive the government of 
Massachusetts Bay of their charter, or to exempt offenders from trial in the places where offences were committed, as there was not, nor could there be, a single 
instance produced to manifest the necessity of it. Are 
not all these things evident proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to tax us? If we want further proofs, do 
not all the debates in the House of Commons serve to 
confirm this? And has not General Gage's conduct 
since his arrival, in stopping the address of his Council, 
and publishing a proclamation more becoming a Turkish 
bashaw, than an English governor, declaring it treason 
to associate in any manner by which the commerce of 
Great Britain is to be affected, has not this exhibited an 
unexampled testimony of the most despotic system of tyranny, that ever was practised in a free government? 
In short, what further proofs are wanting to satisfy any 
one of the designs of the ministry, than their own acts, 
which are uniform and plainly tending to the same point, 
nay, if I mistake not, avowedly to fix the right of taxation ? What hope have we then from petitioning, when 
they tell us, that now or never is the time to fix the 
matter? Shall we, after this, whine and cry for relief, 
when we have already tried it in vain ? Or shall we 
supinely sit and see one province after another fall a 
sacrifice to despotism? 
</p><p>
If I were in any doubt, as to the right which the Parliament of Great Britain had to tax us without our consent, I should most heartily coincide with you in opinion, 
that to petition, and petition only, is the proper method 
to apply for relief; because we should then be asking a 
favor, and not claiming a right, which, by the law of 
nature and by our constitution, we are, in my opinion, 
indubitably entitled to. I should even think it criminal 
to go further than this, under such an idea ; but I have 
none such. I think the Parliament of Great Britain have 
no more right to put their hands into my pocket, without 
my consent, than I have to put my hands into yours ; 
and this being already urged to them in a firm, but decent manner, by all the colonies, what reason is there 
to expect any thing from their justice ? 
</p><p>
As to the resolution for addressing the throne, I own 
to you, Sir, I think the whole might as well have been 
expunged. I expect nothing from the measure, nor 
should my voice have sanctioned it, if the non-importation scheme was intended to be retarded by it ; for I am convinced, as much as I am of my existence, that 
there is no relief for us but in their distress ; and I think, 
at least I hope, that there is public virtue enough left 
among us to deny ourselves every thing but the bare 
necessaries of life to accomplish this end. This we have 
a right to do, and no power upon earth can compel us 
to do otherwise, till it has first reduced us to the most 
abject state of slavery. The stopping of our exports 
would, no doubt, be a shorter method than the other to 
effect this purpose; but if we owe money to Great 
Britain, nothing but the last necessity can justify the 
non-payment of it ; and, therefore, I have great doubts 
upon this head, and wish to see the other method first 
tried, which is legal and will facilitate these payments. 
</p><p>
I cannot conclude without expressing some concern, 
that I should differ so widely in sentiments from you, on 
a matter of such great moment and general import ; and 
I should much distrust my own judgment upon the occasion, if my nature did not recoil at the thought of submitting to measures, which I think subversive of every 
thing that I ought to hold dear and valuable, and did I 
not find, at the same time, that the voice of mankind is 
with me. I must apologize for sending you so rough a sketch of my thoughts upon your letter. When I look 
back, and see the length of my own, I cannot, as I am a good deal hurried at this time, think of taking off a fair copy. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.
