SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you will receive Mr. Hughes's warrant in 
his own right, for two thousand acres of land, the getting of which, at this time, he must look upon as a very 
great favor, as the Governor has dispensed with two 
positive instructions to oblige him. He would not grant 
a warrant for the other claims under Johnston. Hughes 
was very negligent in not sending the former certificates 
granted him. 
</p><p>
I got a gentleman of my acquaintance in Maryland to 
mention his case to Governor Eden, who promised to 
have the matter inquired into, and do what he could for 
his relief. Why it has not been done, I cannot tell ; but 
if my contributing twenty or twenty -five pounds to his 
relief will procure his liberty, you may set me down for 
that sum, and I will pay it at any time when the subscription is full. But how he is to get over the other 
matter, of giving Maryland security for his good behaviour, I know not. You are best acquainted with the 
circumstances of the case. I am, &,c. f 
</p>
