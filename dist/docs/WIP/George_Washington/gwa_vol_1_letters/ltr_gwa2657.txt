MY LORD, 
</p><p>
It is with infinite concern, that I see the distresses o 
the people, and hear their complaints, without being 
able to afford them relief. I have so often troubled you 
for aid from the militia, that I am almost ashamed to repeat my demands ; nor should I do it again, did I not 
think it absolutely necessary at this time to save the most valuable and flourishing part of this county from 
immediate desertion. And how soon the remaining 
part, as well as the adjacent counties, may share the 
same fate, is but too obvious to reason, and to your 
Lordship's good sense. The whole settlement of Conococheague in Maryland is fled, and there now remain 
only two families from thence to Fredericktown, w r hich 
is several miles below the Blue Ridge. We are thus 
quite exposed, and have no better security on that side, 
than the Potomac River, for many miles below the Shenandoah ; and how great a security that is to us, may 
easily be discerned, when we consider, with what facility 
the enemy have passed and repassed it already. That 
the Maryland settlements are all abandoned is certainly 
a fact, as I have had the accounts transmitted to me by 
several hands, and confirmed yesterday by Henry 
Brinker, who left Monocosy the day before, and who 
also affirms, that three hundred and fifty wagons had 
passed that place to avoid the enemy, within the space 
of three days. 
</p><p>
I thought it expedient to communicate this intelligence, that your Lordship may know the reasons for 
asking succours for these unhappy people, and how 
absolutely necessary it is to use, without delay, such 
vigorous measures as will save that settlement from 
total desolation. 
</p><p>
We see, my Lord, the absurdity of the people's arguments, and the consequences of leaving one county, 
nay, one part of a county, or, to go still farther, a single 
company, that is more exposed than another, to defend 
itself and the parts in danger. When Hampshire was 
invaded, and called on Frederic for assistance, the people of the latter refused their aid, answering, " Let them 
defend themselves, as we shall do if they come to us." 
Now that the enemy have forced through that county, and begin to infest this, those a little removed from danger are equally infatuated ; and it will thus be, I fear, 
until all in turn fall a sacrifice to an insulting and merciless enemy. 
</p><p>
These observations may be improperly offered to 
your Lordship, but they occur in so strong a light to 
me, that I could not resist the impulse to make them. 
I am so weak-handed here, that I cannot, without stopping the public works, spare a man to these people's 
assistance. Yet I look upon the retaining of them to be 
so essential to the well-being of the county in general, 
that I have ordered all the men, that can possibly be 
spared, to march thitherwards ; and they will accordingly set out to-morrow morning, to remain there until 
your Lordship can relieve them, that they may return to 
these works, which in my opinion are of no little importance to the safety of the county, if we should be attacked 
by numbers, as we have reason to apprehend. I hope 
your Lordship will exert your authority in raising men 
for this salutary end, and that you will think it advisable 
to make every company furnish its quota. This will 
remove the complaints of the people below, who say 
they cannot leave their families to the mercy of the 
enemy, while they are scouring the woods. 
</p><p>
This is the reason given by some why Caton's party 
consists of but ten men, while others say it proceeds 
from dislike to the man. I acquainted the Governor 
with your Lordship's order for raising fifty men for this 
service, who approved it, and has been pleased to direct 
me to continue them as long as I see cause. 
</p><p>
I cannot conclude without again mentioning how 
agreeable it would be, if your Lordship would order a 
party immediately to those parts, that I may withdraw 
my men to their duty at this place. 
</p><p>
I am, my Lord, &c. 
</p>
