DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you will receive a bill, which please to accept, and place to my credit. Since my last, your 
agreeable favor, covering an invoice of sundries, has 
come to hand, as have the goods also, in good order ; 
which is more than most of the importers by that ship 
can boast, great part of her cargo being damaged, 
through the negligence, it is said, of the captain.

My brother is safely arrived, and but little benefited in point of health by his trip to England. The longing 
desire, which for many years I have had, of visiting the 
great metropolis of that kingdom, is not in the least 
abated by his prejudices, because I think the small share 
of health he enjoyed, while there, must have given a 
check to any pleasures he might anticipate, and would 
render any place irksome ; but I am now tied, and must 
set inclination aside. 
</p><p>
The scale of fortune in America is turned greatly in 
our favor, and success has become the companion of our 
fortunate generals. It \vould be folly in me to attempt 
particularizing their actions, since you receive accounts 
in a channel so much more direct than from hence. 
</p><p>
I am now, I believe, fixed at this seat with an agreeable partner for life, and I hope to find more happiness in 
retirement, than I ever experienced amidst the wide and 
bustling world. I thank you heartily for your affectionate wishes. Why will you not give me an occasion of 
congratulating you in the same manner 1 None would 
do it more cordially than, dear Sir, your most obedient 
and obliged servant. 
</p>
