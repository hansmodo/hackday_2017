TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 20 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Peyrouny, soliciting for leave to attend the Assembly, with the hope of having some allowance made 
for his loss of clothes and other articles, which he sustained in common with us all, and being not thoroughly 
cured of his wounds, which have hitherto rendered 
him unfit for duty, I thought it proper to indulge him in 
this request. By him I again take the liberty of reminding your Honor of the great necessity there is of a 
regulation in the soldiers' pay, and that a deduction be 
made for the country to furnish them with clothes; 
otherwise they never will be fit for service ; they are 
now naked, and cannot get credit even for a hat, and 
are teazing the officers every day to furnish them with 
these and other necessaries. 
</p><p>
Another thing, which should be fixed indisputably, is 
the law we are to be guided by, whether martial or 
military. If the former, I must beg the favor of your 
Honor to give me some written orders and indemnification ; otherwise I cannot give my assent (as I am liable 
for all proceedings) to any judgment of a court-martial, 
that touches the life of a soldier ; though at this time 
there is an absolute necessity for it, as the soldiers are deserting constantly. Yesterday, while we were at 
church, twenty-five of them collected, and were going 
off in the face of their officers, but were stopped and imprisoned before the plot came to its height. 
</p><p>
Colonel Innes did not fill up any commissions for the 
Virginia regiment, which has given those entitled to 
promotion some uneasiness. His reasons were, that it 
would be an unnecessary expense to the country, till 
there were orders to recruit ; but this, I think, should 
not have been considered, while it is remembered how 
small encouragement is shown them upon every occasion. Another motive, which, I believe, served to prevent it, was his dislike to the form of the commissions, 
as it savoured so much of the militia. He told me he 
would send down another form for your approbation, and 
Colonel Fairfax has also taken another, both of which 
are greatly preferable to those by which we act. And 
here I must beg leave to acquaint you, that the one you 
sent me is not signed. 
</p><p>
The officers are uneasy about their pay, and think it 
hard to be kept out of it so long. They hope you will 
order the dates of their commissions to be from the time 
of the vacancies that happened, of which I have enclosed 
a list for your information, hoping with them, that you 
will be kind enough to fill them up yourself, and return 
such commissions as were sent for precedents. 
</p><p>
Mr. West, lieutenant of Vanbraam's company, has 
resigned his commission, which I herewith send. I also 
enclose a list of medicines, which the doctor desires may 
be procured for the use of the regiment. He solicits 
much for an assistant, and I believe it necessary, as he 
often has more business than he can well manage, and, 
were a large detachment sent upon duty, it would be 
imprudent to go without the surgeon. 
</p><p>
If you should think proper to promote Mr. Peyrouny, we shall be at a loss for a good disciplinarian to do adjutant's duty, which requires a perfect knowledge of all 
the kinds of duty. I should, therefore, take it extremely 
kind, if you would be pleased to confer the office upon 
Mr. Frazier, whom I think I can fully answer for, let his 
former conduct have been what it may. 
</p><p>
We have caught two deserters, whom I shall keep 
imprisoned till I receive your answer how far the martial 
law may be extended. It is necessary that an example 
be made of some, as a warning to others; for there is 
scarcely a night, or an opportunity, when there are not 
desertions, and often two, three, or four at a time. We 
always advertise and pursue them as quickly as possible, 
but seldom to any purpose. The expenses attending 
this will fall heavily upon the country while this spirit 
prevails. I am, &,c. 
</p>
