TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I think it incumbent on me to be informed by your 
Honor, how the regiment under my command is to be 
furnished with tents, ammunition, cartridge-paper, and 
many other requisites, that may be wanted in the course 
of the campaign. We expect here to be furnished with 
all those articles from his Majesty's stores, but it is necessary for me to learn this from you. 
</p><p>
The last Assembly, in their Supply Bill, provided for 
a chaplain to our regiment. On this subject I had often 
without any success applied to Governor Dinwiddie. I 
now flatter myself, that your Honor will be pleased to 
appoint a sober, serious man for this duty. Common 
decency, Sir, in a camp calls for the services of a divine, 
which ought not to be dispensed with, although the 
world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of 
religion, and incapable of good instructions. 
</p><p>
I now enclose a monthly return for March, and am, 
honorable Sir, your most obedient, humble servant. 
</p>
