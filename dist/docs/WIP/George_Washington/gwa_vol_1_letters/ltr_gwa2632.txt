</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After returning you most sincere and grateful thanks, 
for your kind condolence on my late indisposition, and 
for the generous and (give me leave farther to say) partial 
opinion, you have entertained of my military abilities, I 
must express my concern for not having it in my power 
to meet you, and other friends, who have signified their 
desire of seeing me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. 
</p><p>
Your letter only came to hand at nine last night, and 
you inform me, that the Assembly will break up the 
latter end of the week, which allows a time too short in 
which to perform a journey of a hundred and sixty 
miles, especially 'by a person in my feeble condition; 
for, although I am happily recovered from the disorder, 
which brought me to so low an ebb, by a sickness 
of nearly five weeks' continuance, yet my strength is not returned. Had I received timely notice, I would 
have attempted the ride, by slow and easy journeys, if it 
had been only for the satisfaction of seeing my friends, 
who, I flatter myself, from what you say, are kind enough 
to sympathize in my good and evil fortunes. 
</p><p>
The chief cause, next to indisposition, that prevented 
me from going down to this Assembly, was a determination not to offer my services ; and that determination 
proceeded from the following reasons. First, a belief 
that I could not get a command upon such terms as I 
should incline to accept; for I must confess to you, that 
I never will quit my family, injure my fortune, and, above 
all, impair my health, to run the risk of such changes 
and vicissitudes, as I have met with, but shall expect, if 
I am employed again, to have something certain. Again, 
were I to accept the command, I should insist upon 
some things, which ignorance and inexperience made 
me overlook before, particularly that of having the officers appointed, in some measure, with my advice and 
with my concurrence. It appears to me strange, that a 
commanding officer should not have this liberty, when 
it is considered how much the conduct and bravery of 
an officer influence the men, how much a commanding 
officer is answerable for the behaviour of the inferior 
officers, and how much his good or ill success, in time 
of action, depends upon the conduct of each particular 
one, especially too, in this kind of fighting, where, being 
dispersed, each and every one of them has a greater 
liberty to misbehave, than if he were regularly and 
compactly drawn up under the eyes of his superior. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, how little credit is given to a 
commander, who, after a defeat, in relating the cause of 
it, justly lays the blame on some individual, whose cowardly behaviour betrayed the whole to ruin. How little 
does the world consider the circumstances, and how apt are mankind to level their vindictive censures against the 
unfortunate chief, who perhaps merited least of the blame. 
</p><p>
Does it not appear, then, that the appointing of officers is a thing of the utmost consequence ; a thing that 
requires the greatest circumspection 1 Ought it to be 
left to blind chance, or, what is still worse, to partiality ? 
Should it not be left to a man, whose life, and, what i 
still dearer, whose honor, depends on their good behaviour 
</p><p>
Officers are yet wanting, for whom no provision h 
been made. A small military chest is so necessary, 
that it is impossible to do without it, nor .can any man 
conduct an affair of this kind, who has it not. 
</p><p>
These things I should expect, if the appointment should fall upon me. 
</p><p>
But, besides all these, I had other reasons, which 
withheld me from offering my services. I believe our 
circumstances are brought to such an unhappy dilemma, 
that no man can gain any honor by conducting our forces 
at this time, but will rather lose in his reputation if he 
attempts it. I am confident, that the progress of military movements must be slow, for want of conveniences 
to transport our provisions, ammunition, and stores, over 
the mountains ; occasioned, in a great measure, by the 
late ill treatment of the wagoners and horse- drivers, 
who have received little compensation for their labor, 
and nothing for their lost horses and wagons ; wilich 
will be an infallible cause of preventing all from assisting, 
who are not compelled. Hence I am fully sensible, that 
whoever undertakes this command will meet with such 
insurmountable obstacles, that he will soon be viewed in 
the light of an idle, indolent body, have his conduct 
criticized, and meet perhaps with abuse, when it may 
be as much out of his power to avoid delays, as it would 
be to command the raging seas in a storm. 
</p><p>
This view of things has had no small influence upon 
me, as I am very apprehensive I should lose, what at 
present constitutes the chief part of my happiness, that 
is, the esteem and notice, which the country has been 
pleased to honor me with. 
</p><p>
It is possible you may infer from what I have said, 
that my intentions are to decline, at all events ; but this 
is not my meaning. I am determined not to offer ; because to solicit the command, and, at the same time, to 
make my proposals, w r ould be a little incongruous, and 
carry with it the face of self-sufficiency. But if the 
command should be offered to me, the case will then be 
altered, as I should be at liberty to make such objections, 
as reason and my small experience have pointed out
</p><p>
I am, dear Warner, your most affectionate friend, and obedient servant.
