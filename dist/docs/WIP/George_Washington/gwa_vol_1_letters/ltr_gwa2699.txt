<p>
TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 19 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your obliging favor of this date I just now had the 
pleasure of receiving. You flatter me much by coinciding 
with me in opinion, relative to the proposed expedition. 
</p><p>
Captain Dagworthy returned hither yesterday in consequence of orders from Sir John St. Clair, forwarded 
by the commanding officer at Fort Frederic. I will 
send out a party on Braddock's road, which I shall be 
able to reinforce when Colonel Mercer returns. 
</p><p>
I am exceedingly obliged by the handsome and polite manner, in which you are pleased to give me leave 
to attend the election at Winchester. Although my being there, under any other circumstances, would be very agreeable to me, yet I can hardly persuade myself 
to think of being absent from my more immediate duty, even for a few days. I will not, however, come to any absolute determination, till I receive answers to some 
letters on that subject, which I expect this night or tomorrow. I am, &c. 
</p>
