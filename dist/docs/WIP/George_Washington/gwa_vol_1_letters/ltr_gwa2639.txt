<p>
TO COLONEL ADAM STEPHEN. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 28 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Captain John Mercer only returned last night from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and brings no satisfactory answers to any thing I questioned the Governor upon. 
</p><p>
The express, that was sent to General Shirley, has 
returned without seeing him. However, the Governor 
writes that he expects answers to his letters by Colonel 
Hunter, who is now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and waits the arrival 
of the General at that place. The Governor is very 
strongly of opinion, that Captain Dag worthy has no 
right to contend for the command ; and in his letter he 
says, after mentioning the return of the express, and his 
expectation of satisfactory letters, " But I am of opinion 
you might have obviated the inconsistent dispute with 
Captain Dagworthy, by asking him if he did not command a provincial company by virtue of Governor 
Sharpe's commission ; as that he had formerly from his 
Majesty now ceases, as he is not on the half-pay list. 
If so, the method you are to take is very obvious, as 
your commission from me is greater than what he has." 
And in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, when I was down there, both he 
and Colonel Fitzhugh told me, that Dagworthy could 
have no more pretensions to command me, or either of 
the field-officers of the Virginia regiment, than we have 
to command General Shirley; and further gave it as 
their opinion, that as Dagworthy's was only a botchedup commission at best, and as he commanded a provincial company, and by virtue of a governor's commission, 
he ought to be arrested for his presumption. They say, 
allowing his commission from the King to be valid, yet, 
as he is not there by order of his Majesty, he can have 
no better pretensions to assume the command, than a 
visiting half-pay officer, who transiently passes through the camp. 
</p><p>
I wish you would sound him on this head, and hear 
how he will answer these things, and let me know when 
you come down, which I desire may be immediately, as 
I want much to consult you upon several accounts. The 
paymaster, and commissary, if not very much engaged, 
must accompany you. Desire both to have their accounts settled, and brought with them, as that is necessary before I can give more money. 
</p><p>
I have sent you one of the mutiny bills, which I 
received from below, but I believe it is necessary, as we 
still want the power, to postpone trials until after your 
return. 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a commission for Captain Waggener, 
which I have neglected giving before. Desire him, as 
the command upon your leaving the place will devolve 
upon him, to be very circumspect in his duty, and to 
see that the troops are duly drawn out and trained to 
their exercise, and practised to bush-fighting. 
</p><p>
As I expect in a very few days to have the pleasure 
of seeing you, I shall only add, I am, &c. 
</p>
