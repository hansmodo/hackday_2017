DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
As I have heard, since my arrival at this place, a circumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I 
take this early opportunity of contradicting the first, and 
of assuring you, that I have not as yet composed the 
latter. But, by the all-powerful dispensations of Providence, I have been protected beyond all human probability or expectation ; for I had four bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt, 
although death was levelling my companions on every 
side of me ! 
</p><p>
We have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling 
body of men, but fatigue and want of time prevent me 
from giving you any of the details, until I have the happiness of seeing you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, which I now 
most ardently wish for, since we are driven in thus far. 
A feeble state of health obliges me to halt here for 
two or three days, to recover a little strength, that I 
may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with 
more ease. You may expect to see me there on Saturday or Sunday fortnight, which is as soon as I can 
well be down, as I shall take my Bullskin Plantations 
in my way. Pray give my compliments to all my 
friends. I am, dear Jack, your most affectionate 
brother, 
</p>
