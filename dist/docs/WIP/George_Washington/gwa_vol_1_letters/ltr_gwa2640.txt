<p>
TO ROBERT HUNTER MORRIS, GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 5 January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am sorry it has not been in my power to acknowledge the receipt of yours until now. At the time your 
letter came to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> ;. before I got back, it was conveyed thither ; and so from 
place to place it has been tossing almost until this time. 
</p><p>
There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy, and nothing that 
requires greater pains to obtain. I shall, therefore, 
cheerfully come into any measures you can propose to 
settle a correspondence for this salutary end ; and you 
may depend upon receiving (when the provinces are 
threatened) the earliest and best intelligence I can 
procure. 
</p><p>
I sympathized in a general concern to see the inactivity of your province in a time of imminent danger ; 
but am pleased to find, that a feeling sense of wrongs has roused the spirit of your martial Assembly to vote 
a sum, which, with your judicious application, will turn to a general good.
</p><p>
We took some pretty vigorous measures to collect a 
force upon our frontiers, upon the first alarm, which has 
kept us peaceable ever since. How long this may last 
is uncertain, since that force, which consisted of militia, 
is disbanded, and the recruiting service almost stagnated. 
</p><p>
If you propose to levy troops, and their destination is 
not a secret, I should be favored w r ere I let into the 
scheme, that we may act conjunctly, so far as the nature of things will admit. 
</p><p>
Pray direct to me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, to which place I 
intend to go in about ten days. I am, &,c. 
</p>
