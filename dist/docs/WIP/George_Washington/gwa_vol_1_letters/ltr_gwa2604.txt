<p>
TO JAMES HAMILTON, GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest concern I acquaint you, that 
Mr. Ward, ensign in Captain Trent's company, was 
compelled to surrender his small fort at the Fork of 
the Monongahela to the French, on the 17th instant, who 
fell down from Venango, with a fleet of three hundred 
and sixty batteaux and canoes, upwards of one thousand men, and eighteen pieces of artillery, which they 
planted against the fort, drew up their men, and sent 
the enclosed summons to Mr. Ward, who, having but an inconsiderable number of men, and no cannon, to 
make a proper defence, was obliged to surrender. 
They suffered him to draw off his men, arms, and 
working- tools, and gave leave that he might retreat 
to the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
I have heard of your Honor's great zeal for his Majesty's service, and for all our interests on the present 
occasion. You will see, by the enclosed speech of the 
Half-King, that the Indians expect some assistance from 
you ; and I am persuaded you will take proper notice 
of their moving speech, and their unshaken fidelity. 
</p><p>
I thought it more advisable to acquaint your Honor 
with it immediately, than to wait till you could get intelligence by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> and the young man, 
as the Half-King proposes. 
</p><p>
I have arrived thus far with a detachment of one hundred and fifty men. Colonel Fry, with the remainder 
of the regiment and artillery, is daily expected. In the 
mean time, we advance slowly across the mountains,, 
making the roads, as we march, fit for the carriage of our great guns ; and are designed to proceed as far as 
the mouth of Red-stone Creek, which enters the Monongahela about thirty-seven miles above the fort taken 
by the French, from whence we have a water carriage 
down the river. And there is a storehouse built by 
the Ohio Company, which may serve as a receptacle 
for our ammunition and provisions. 
</p><p>
Besides these French, that came from Venango, we 
have credible accounts, that another party are coming 
up the Ohio. We also have intelligence, that six hundred of the Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down 
Scioto Creek to join them. I hope your Honor will 
excuse the freedom I have assumed in acquainting you 
with these advices ; it was the warm zeal I owe my 
country, that influenced me to it, and occasioned this 
express. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect and regard, your Honor's 
most obedient and very humble servant. 
</p>
