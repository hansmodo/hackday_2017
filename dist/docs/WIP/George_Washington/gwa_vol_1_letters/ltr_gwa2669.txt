DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
A person of a readier pen, and having more time, 
than myself, might amuse you with the vicissitudes, 
which have happened in the Indian affairs since Mr. Atkin came up. I acknowledge my incompetency, and 
therefore shall only observe, that the Indians have been 
pleased and displeased oftener than they ought to have 
been; and that they are gone off (that party under 
Warhatalie, I mean,) in different ways, and with far different views ; one company southwardly to their nation ; 
and another northwardly to treat with the Pennsylvanians, contrary to the sentiments of Mr. Atkin, who 
has, I believe, sent to forbid any conference to be held with them. 
</p><p>
Major Lewis is returned with part of the Indians, 
that went out with him, in consequence of their having 
taken only eight days' provisions with them. He was 
unable to prevail with those savages to take more. One 
party of twenty, with ten soldiers, is gone towards Fort 
Duquesne, under Captain Spotswood ; and another 
party of fifteen, with five soldiers, under Lieutenant Baker, who are to proceed towards Logstown. God 
send them success and a safe return. 
</p><p>
Unless you will interest yourself in sending money to 
discharge the public debts, I must inevitably suffer very 
considerably, as the country people all think me pledged 
to them, let what will happen. They are grown very 
clamorous, and will be more than ever incensed, if there 
should come an inadequate sum, and that sum be appropriated to the payment of the soldiers. 
</p><p>
I am convinced it would give pleasure to the Governor to hear that I was involved in trouble, however 
undeservedly, such are his dispositions towards me. 
</p><p>
I am, 
</p>
