DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
As wearing boots is quite the mode, and mine are in a declining state, I must beg the favor of you to procure me a pair that are good and neat, and send them to Major Carlyle, who, I hope, will contrive to forward 
them, as quickly as my necessity requires. 
</p><p>
I see no prospect of moving from this place soon, as 
we have neither horses nor wagons enough, and no forage, except what is expected from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; therefore, I am well convinced, that the trouble and difficulty 
we must encounter in passing the mountains, for the want of proper conveniences, will equal all the difficulties of the campaign ; for I conceive the march of such 
a train of artillery, in these roads, to be a tremendous undertaking. As to any danger from the enemy, I look upon it as trifling, for I believe the French will be 
obliged to exert their utmost force to repel the attacks to the northward, where Governor Shirley and others, with a body of eight thousand men, will annoy their settlements, and attempt their forts. 
</p><p>
The General has appointed me one of his aids-decamp, in which character I shall serve this campaign agreeably enough, as I am thereby freed from all commands but his, and give his orders, which must be implicitly obeyed. 
</p><p>
I have now a good opportunity, and shall not neglect it, of forming an acquaintance, which may be serviceable hereafter, if I find it worth while to push my fortune in the military line. 
</p><p>
I have written to my two female correspondents by this opportunity, one of whose letters I have enclosed to you, and beg your deliverance of it. I shall expect a particular account of all that has happened since my departure. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Jack, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate brother. 
</p>
