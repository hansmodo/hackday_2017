DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 5th instant came to this place, forwarded by Mr. Ramsay, a few days after my return 
from William sbu rg, and I delayed acknowledging it sooner, in the hope that I should find time, before I 
began my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to answer it fully, 
if not satisfactorily ; but, as much of my time has been engrossed since I came home by company, by your 
brother's sale and the business consequent thereupon, in writing letters to England, and now in attending to 
my own domestic affairs previous to my departure, I find it impossible to bestow as much attention on the 
subject of your letter as I could wish, and, therefore, I must rely upon your good nature and candor in excuse 
for not attempting it. In truth, persuaded as I am, 
that you have read all the political pieces, which compose a large share of the gazettes at this time, I should 
think it, but for your request, a piece of inexcusable arrogance in me, to make the least essay towards a change 
in your political opinions ; for I am sure I have no new light to throw upon the subject, nor any other arguments to offer in support of my own doctrine, than what 
you have seen ; .and I could only in general add, that an innate spirit of freedom first told me, that the measures, 
which the administration have for some time been, and now are most violently pursuing, are opposed to every 
principle of natural justice; whilst much abler heads than my own have fully convinced me, that they are not 
only repugnant to natural right, but subversive of the laws and constitution of Great Britain itself, in the establishment of which some of the best blood in the kingdom has been spilt. 
</p><p>
Satisfied, then, that the acts of the British Parliament are no longer governed by the principles of justice, that 
they are trampling upon the valuable rights of Americans, confirmed to them by charter and by the constitution they themselves boast of, and convinced beyond the 
smallest doubt, that these measures are the result of deliberation, and attempted to be carried into execution 
by the hand of power, is it a time to trifle, or risk our 
cause upon petitions, which with difficulty obtain access, 
and afterwards are thrown by with the utmost contempt ? Or should we, because heretofore unsuspicious 
of design, and then unwilling to enter into disputes with 
the mother country, go on to bear more, and forbear to 
enumerate our just causes of complaint ? For my own 
part, I shall not undertake to say where the line between Great Britain and the colonies should be drawn ; 
but I am clearly of opinion, that one ought to be drawn, 
and our rights clearly ascertained. I could wish, I own, 
that the dispute had been left to posterity to determine, 
but the crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights, 
or submit to every imposition, that can be heaped upon 
us, till custom and use shall make us tame and abject 
slaves. 
</p><p>
I intended to write no more than an apology for not 
writing ; but I find I am insensibly running into a length 
I did not expect, and therefore shall conclude with remarking, that, if you disavow the right of Parliament to 
tax us, unrepresented as we are, we only differ in respect to the mode of opposition, and this difference 
principally arises from your belief, that they (the Parliament, I mean,) want a decent opportunity to repeal the 
acts ; whilst I am fully convinced, that there has been a 
regular, systematic plan formed to enforce them, and 
that nothing but unanimity and firmness in the colonies, 
which they did not expect, can prevent it. By the best advices from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> it seems, that General Gage is exceedingly disconcerted at the quiet and steady conduct 
of the people of the Massachusetts Bay, and at the 
measures pursuing by the other governments. I dare 
say he expected to force those oppressed people into 
compliance, or irritate them to acts of violence before 
this, for a more colorable pretence of ruling that and the 
other colonies with a high hand. 
</p><p>
I shall set off on Wednesday next for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
where, if you have any commands, I shall be glad to 
oblige you in them ; being, dear Sir, with real regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant. 
</p><p>
P. S. Pray what do you think of the Canada Bill?
