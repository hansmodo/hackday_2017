<p>
TO CAPTAIN ROBERT MACKENZIE.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 9 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 13th ultimo from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> gave me pleasure, as I learnt thereby, that you were well, and 
might be expected at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> in your way to or from James River, in the course of the winter. 
</p><p>
When I have said this, permit me with the freedom 
of a friend (for you know I always esteemed you) to express my sorrow, that fortune should place you in a 
service, that must fix curses to the latest posterity upon the contrivers, and, if success (which, by the by, is 
impossible) accompanies it, execrations upon all those, who have been instrumental in the execution. 
</p><p>
I do not mean by this to insinuate, that an officer is 
not to discharge his duty, even when chance, not choice, 
has placed him in a disagreeable situation ; but I conceive, when you condemn the conduct of the Massachusetts people, you reason from effects, not causes ; otherwise you would not wonder at a people, who are every day receiving fresh proofs of a systematic assertion of 
an arbitrary power, deeply planned to overturn the laws 
and constitution of their country, and to violate the most 
essential and valuable rights of mankind, being irritated, 
and with difficulty restrained from acts of the greatest 
violence and intemperance. For my own part, I confess to you candidly, that I view things in a very different point of light from the one in which you seem to 
consider them ; and though you are led to believe by 
venal men, for such I must take the liberty of calling 
those new-fangled counsellors, who fly to and surround 
you, and all others, who, for honors or pecuniary gratifications, will lend their aid to overturn the constitution, 
and introduce a system of arbitrary government, although you are taught, I say, by discoursing with such men, to believe, that the people of Massachusetts are 
rebellious, setting up for independency, and what not, 
give me leave, my good friend, to tell you, that you are 
abused, grossly abused. This I advance with a degree 
of confidence and boldness, which may claim your belief, 
having better opportunities of knowing the real sentiments of the people you are among, from the leaders of 
them, in opposition to the present measures of the administration, than you have from those whose business 
it is, not to disclose truths, but to misrepresent facts in 
order to justify as much as possible to the world their 
own conduct. Give me leave to add, and I think I 
can announce it as a fact, that it is not the wish or interest of that government, or any other upon this continent, 
separately or collectively, to set up for independence ; 
but this you may at the same time rely on, that none of 
them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights 
and privileges, which are essential to the happiness of 
every free state, and without which, life, liberty, and 
property are rendered totally insecure. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, being certain consequences, which must 
naturally result from the late acts of Parliament relative 
to America in general, and the government of Massachusetts Bay in particular, is it to be wondered at, I 
repeat, that men, who wish to avert the impending 
blow, should attempt to oppose it in its progress, or 
prepare for their defence, if it cannot be averted? 
Surely I may be allowed to answer in the negative; and 
again give me leave to add as my opinion, that more blood will be spilled on this occasion, if the ministry are 
determined to push matters to extremity, than history 
has ever yet furnished instances of in the annals of 
North America, and such a vital wound will be given to 
the peace of this great country, as time itself cannot 
cure, or eradicate the remembrance of. 
</p><p>
But I have done. I was involuntarily led into a short 
discussion of this subject by your remarks on the conduct of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people, and your opinion of their 
wishes to set up for independency. I am well satisfied, 
that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all 
North America ; on the contrary, that it is the ardent 
wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace 
and tranquillity, upon constitutional grounds, may be 
restored, and the horrors of civil discord prevented. 
</p><p>
I am very glad to learn, that my friend Stewart was 
well when you left London. I have not had a letter 
from him these five years, nor heard of him I think for 
two. I wish you had mentioned his employment. 
I remain, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.
