MY DEAR STEWART, 
</p><p>
By Captain Walter Stewart I am favored with an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of 
the 6th of June, and at the same time of forwarding the 
copy of my former one, which was in readiness before 
that came to hand, and which I incline to send, notwithstanding the original has reached you, because it contains the second bills, arid other matters entire as they 
ought to have been sent, and as I dare say Mr. Stewart 
will be so good as to deliver them. 
</p><p>
Another tempest has arisen upon our frontiers, and 
the alarm spread wider than ever. In short, the inhabitants are so apprehensive of danger, that no families 
remain above the Conococheague road, and many are 
gone below it. Their harvests are in a manner lost, and 
the distresses of the settlement are evident and manifold. In Augusta many people have been killed, and 
numbers fled. Confusion and despair prevail in every 
quarter. At this instant a calm is taking place, which 
forebodes some mischief to Colonel Bouquet. At least 
those, who wish well to the convoy, are apprehensive 
for him ; since it is not unlikely, that the retreat of all 
the Indian parties at one and the same time from our 
frontiers, is a proof of their assembling a force somewhere, and for some particular purpose, and none more 
likely than to oppose his march.
</p><p>
It was expected, that our Assembly would have been 
called, in such exigences as these ; but it is concluded, 
as I have been informed, that an Assembly without 
money would be no eligible plan. To comprehend the 
meaning of this expression you must know, that the 
Board of Trade, at the instance of the British merchants, have undertaken to rebuke us in the most ample 
manner for our paper emissions ; and therefore the Governor and Council have directed one thousand militia to 
be employed for the protection of the frontiers, five 
hundred of whom are to be drafted from Hampshire 
and other counties, and to be under the command 
of Colonel Stephen, whose military courage and capacity, says the Governor, are well established. The 
other five hundred, from the southern frontier counties, 
are to be conducted by Major Lewis ; so that you may 
readily conceive what an enormous expense must attend these measures. Stephen, immediately upon the 
Indians' retiring, advanced to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with two 
hundred or two hundred and fifty militia, and will doubtless achieve some signal advantage, of which the public 
will soon be informed. 
</p><p>
I think I have now communicated the only news, 
which these parts afford. It is of a melancholy nature, indeed, and we cannot tell how or when the affair will end. I hope you may have got matters settled 
to your liking before this time. I should rejoice to hear 
it, as I should at every thing that gives you pleasure or 
profit. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington makes a tender of her compliments, 
and you may be assured that I am, with great sincerity, 
dear Sir, your most obedient and affectionate servant.
