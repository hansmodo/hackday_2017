DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The French are so well drubbed, and seem so much 
humbled in America, that I apprehend our generals will 
find it no difficult matter to reduce Canada to our obedience this summer. But what may be Montgomery's 
fate in the Cherokee country I cannot so readily determine. It seems he has made a prosperous beginning, 
having penetrated into the heart of the country, and he 
is now advancing his troops in high health and spirits to 
the relief of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. But let him be wary. He 
has a crafty, subtle enemy to deal with, that may give 
him most trouble when he least expects it. We are 
in pain here for the king of Prussia, and wish Hanover 
safe, these being events in which we are much interested. 
</p><p>
My indulging myself in a trip to England depends 
upon so many contingencies, which, in all probability, 
may never occur, that I dare not even think of such a 
gratification. Nothing, however, is more ardently desired. But Mrs. Washington and myself would both 
think ourselves very happy in the opportunity of showing you the Virginia hospitality, which is the most agreeable entertainment we can give, or a stranger expect to 
find, in an infant, woody country, like ours. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, yours, &c.
