<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 3 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have sent down an Indian scalp, which was taken 
at the place where Captain Mercer had his engagement. 
He was found thrust under some rocks, with stones 
piled up against them. They believe more were killed, 
from the quantity of blood found on the ground, and 
from other discoveries of their attempts to make more 
graves. But a hard shower of rain prevented their making a farther search. 
</p><p>
We have reason to believe, that the Indians have returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, as some scouts from Fort 
Cumberland saw their tracks that way ; and many corroborating accounts affirm, that the roads over the 
Allegany Mountains are as much beaten, as they were 
last year by General Braddock's army. From these 
and other circumstances we may judge their numbers to 
have been considerable. Whether they are gone for the 
season, or only to bring in a larger party, I am at a loss 
to determine. 
</p><p>
For this reason, and on account of the scarcity of 
provisions on this side of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I must beg 
leave humbly to offer it to your Honor's superior judgment, if it would not be advisable to stop all the militia, 
that are ordered from the ten counties, save about five 
or six hundred from the adjacent ones. These will 
serve to cover our frontiers in this quarter, (which is the 
only part that ever will or can be much exposed,) until 
the regiment is completed by drafts, and until they can 
erect fortresses. Drafts, if they are judiciously chosen, 
will be of infinitely more service, and much less expensive to the country, and they can be immediately sent 
to their posts. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that, if your Honor has a mind to 
stop any part of the militia, you will have full time, notwithstanding they are ordered to rendezvous at this 
place on the 10th instant. I never yet knew any to appear within ten days of the time they were expected ; 
and I am also apprehensive, that having so many of the 
militia out will be the means of retarding the drafts, 
which, above all things, I wish to see completed. 
</p><p>
Though I have often troubled you on this head, I 
must again beg leave to desire your particular instructions and information, as, being in a state of uncertainty, 
without knowing the plan of operations, or what scheme 
to go upon, I am much embarrassed, and left to guess at 
every thing. Orders, that are essential one day, appear 
the next as necessary to be countermanded ; so that I 
really cannot tell how to act for the good of the service, 
or the satisfaction of any individual. Were the regiment complete, and things put on a proper footing, the 
whole would go on smoothly and regularly, which is 
now rendered impossible. So much am I kept in the 
dark, that I do not know whether to prepare for the offensive or defensive ; yet, what might be absolutely 
necessary in the one, would be quite useless in the 
other. 
</p><p>
Great inconveniences arise from our being so dispersed through the country. The men cannot be regularly paid or supplied. If every company had its 
post assigned, their pay might be sent to them, and necessaries always provided in due season. We could 
also have the same advantages were we collected into one place. But there are now so many detachments 
out, that one officer may command men of every company of the regiment, and when necessaries are sent, he 
may be removed from his command, and those things cannot be stopped out of their pay. By this method 
the country loses money, the men are badly supplied, and always discontented. 
</p><p>
I find the act of Assembly against mutiny and desertion quite insufficient, except in those two particular 
crimes. No court-martial can be held, by virtue of this 
act, for trying any officer or soldier charged with cowardice, holding correspondence with the enemy, quitting 
or sleeping upon his post, nay, many other crimes, 
which are provided against in the articles of war. I 
think, at this time, it would be for the good of the service to make an act to enforce the articles of war in 
general, except two or three particular ones, such as impressing wagons, and the like. They are in force in our 
mother country, where they are thought best calculated 
for keeping soldiers under discipline ; and none of them 
would prove burthensome, or inconvenient, either to the 
public or any individual. 
</p><p>
About one hundred and fifty of the Fairfax militia are now in town. Three hundred are expected from Prince 
William. With the soldiers and militia now here, I intend to go out and scour the woods hereabouts for three 
or four days until the others arrive. 
</p><p>
Clothes for the men are very much wanted. We have none in store, and some men, who have been enlisted these two months, and to whom we could give 
nothing but a blanket, shoes, and shirt, are justly dissatisfied at having two pence per day stopped from their 
wages. Provision here is scarce, and the commissary 
much wanted to lay in more. I have been, and still am, 
obliged to do this duty, as well as most others, which I 
would take upon me, rather than let any thing in my 
power be wanted for the good of the country. 
</p><p>
I enclose your Honor the sentence of a general courtmartial, which was held here upon a sergeant for running 
away with his party. They have, I think, very justly 
adjudged him to suffer death, which sentence I hope 
you will approve, as there never was a fitter object to 
make an example of, this being the second time he has 
been guilty of the same crime. I am your Honor's, &c.
