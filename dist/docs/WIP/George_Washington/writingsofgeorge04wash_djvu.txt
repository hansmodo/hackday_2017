TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Now Windsor, 8 AprU, 1781. 

Sir, 

The enclosed return, made up to the first of the 
month, will show the number of recruits, who have 
joined this post of the Continental army since its form- 
ation upon the new establishment. My requests to the 
executives of the several States have been earnest, 
and my orders to the oflicers in them have been point- 
ed and positive, to send forward the recruits as fast 
as possible. What to expect, or rather to apprehend, 
from these delays. Congress can more easily conceive 
than I can describe. Some States, I am told, despair- 
ing of getting their quotas for the war, or three years, 
are resorting to the old expedient of temporary en- 
listments, while impediments of another kind withhold 
the recruits from the army in others. 

The bare relation of these facts, without combining 
other circumstances of equal magnitude and uncertain- 
ty, or adding to them the difficulties with which we

are surrounded for want of money, will convince Con- 
gress of the impracticability of my fixing at this time 
on any definitive plan of a campaign, and of my ina- 
bility to carry into effect those, which have heretofore 
been the objects of contemplation. They will readily 
see, that our future operations depend upon contin- 
gencies, and that our determinations must be the re- 
sult of the moment, and dependent upon circumstances. 
In this view of matters here, the progress of the en- 
emy under Lord Cornwallis, and in consideration of 
the reinforcement which has lately gone to him, I have 
judged it expedient to order the Marquis de Lafayette 
to proceed with his detachment to the southern army, 
and put himself under the orders of Major-General 
Greene. The greatest objection I had to the measure, 
circumstanced as things now are, was, that the detach- 
ment was not formed for the campaign, or for so dis- 
tant a service as that on which they are now ordered ; 
consequently neither officers nor men were prepared 
for it ; but the urgent call for succour to the southern 
States, the proximity of this corps to them, die ex- 
pedition with which it can join the southern army, and 
the public expense that will be saved by its advance, 
have overcome all less considerations in deciding up- 
on it. I wish the march of the Pennsylvania troops 
could be facilitated, and that Moylan's cavalry could 
be recruited, equipped, and marched without delay ; 
for every judicious officer I have conversed with from 
the southward, and all the representations I received 
thence, confirm me in the opinion, that great advan- 
tages are to be derived from a superior cavalry. With- 
out magazines, and with an interrupted communica- 
tion, I do not see how Lord Cornwallis could have 
subsisted his army, if we had outnumbered him in 
horse.

I tliirik it my duty to inform Congress, lliut tliere is 
great dissatislaction at this lime in llie Acw Vorii line 
lor want of pay. Near sixteen months' pay, I am tokl, 
is due. If it were practicable to give this and the 
Jersey troops, if they are in the same predicament, a 
small portion of their pay, it might stop desertion, 
which is frequent, and avert greater evils, which are 
otherwise to be apprehended. The four eastern States 
have given a temporary relief to their troops, which 
makes the case of others, those of New York par- 
ticularly, appear more distressing and grievous to them.

TO MAJOR BENJAMIN TALLMADGE. 

New Windsor, 8 April, 1781. 

Sir, 

The success of the proposed enterprise, must de- 
pend on the absence of the Bridsh Heet, the secrecy 
of the attempt, and a knowledge of the exact situa- 
tion of the enemy. If, after you have been at the 
westwai-d, the circumstances, from your intelligence, 
shall still appear favorable, you will be at liberty to 
be the bearer of the enclosed letter to the Count de 
Rochambeau, to whose determination I have referred 
the matter ; as any cooperation on our part, by moving 
troops towards the Sound, would give such indications 
of the design, as woulxl effectually frustrate the suc- 
cess. Should you not proceed to the Count, you may 
destroy that letter. If, on the contrary, you should 
go to Newport, by keeping an account of the expenses, 
they will be repaid by the public. 

In the mean time, I wish you to be as particular as 
possible, m obtaining from your friend an accurate

account of the enemy's strength on York, Long, and 
Staten Islands, specifying the several corps and their 
distributions. This, I think, from the enemy's present 
weak state, may be procured with more facility and 
accuracy than at any former period. I wish to know, 
also, the strength of the last detachment from New 
York, and of what troops it was composed. 

I need scarcely suggest, if you should go eastwai'd, 
that it will be expedient to do it in such a manner as 
not to create suspicion. Indeed, secrecy is absolutely 
necessary in the whole affair. As Count de Rocham- 
beau does not understand English, it may be well to 
communicate your business to the ChevaUer de Chas- 
tellux in the first instance, and through him to the 
Coimt, lest it should accidentally get abroad in the 
communication. I am, &c.* 

* In the letter to which the above was a reply, Major Tallmadge had 
written as follows. 

" Since the establishment of the Board at New York for the direction 
of the dissociated Loyalists, there appears to have been a regular system 
adopted to open a more effectual communication with the disaffected in 
Connecticut. Chains of intelligence, which are daily growing more 
dangerous, and the more injurious traffic, which is constantly increasing, 
are but too fatal consequences of this system. My informer has re- 
quested me to propose to your Excellency a plan to break up the whole 
body of these marauders. At Lloyd's Neck, on Long Island, it is sup- 
posed there are assembled about eight hundred men, chiefly refugees 
and deserters from our army. Of this number there may be about four 
hundred and fifty or five hundred properly armed. Their naval guard 
consists of one vessel of sixteen guns, two small privateers, and a gal- 
ley. About eight mUes east of Lloyd's Neck, they have a post at 
Treadwell's Bank, of about one hundred and forty men, chiefly wood- 
cutters armed. I have seen an accurate draft of this post and works." 
Hartford, April 6th. 

Major Tallmadge believed, that, if two frigates should enter the Sound, 
in the absence of the British fleet, and at the same time a suitable body 
of troops were embarked in boats, the posts might be cut off. He of- 
fered to aid or direct an enterprise for such an object.

over in person to Long Island, and obtained exact knowledge of the

TO COLO.\i;L JOHN LAURENS, AT PARIS. 

New Windsor, 9 April, 1781. 

My dear Laurens, 

Colonel Arniand, who was charged with the delivery 
of many letters to you from the Marquis de Lafayette, 
imparting to his friends ami the ministry of France 
your mission, unfortunately lurived at Boston after you 
had sailed. By him I gave you an account of the revolt 
of part of the Jersey troops, Arnold's expedition to 
Virginia, Leslie's arrival at Charleston, and such other 
matters as occurred after your departure. 

Since that period several interesting events have 
happened ; some favorable, others adverse. Among 
the former may be reckoned Morgan's brilliant action 
with Tarleton ; among the latter, the advantages gained 
by Lord Cornwallis over General Greene. The official 
accounts of these I enclose to you. Cornwallis, after 
the defeat of Tarleton, destroyed his wagons, and made 
a violent eflbrt to recover his prisoners, but, failing 
therein moved equally light and rapidly against General 
Greene, who, though he had formed a junction with 
Morgan, was obliged to retreat before him into Vir- 
gmia. Whether from despair of recovering his pris- 
oners, of bringing Greene to a general action, or be- 
cause he conceived his own situation critical, I do not 
take upon me to determine ; but the fact is, that here 
commenced Comwallis's retrograde movements, and 
Greene's advance h'om the Roanoke to the place of 
action. 

condition and stren^h of the forts at Lloyd's Neck and Treadwell's 
Bank. He then returned, and proceeded to Newport, where he found 
Count de Rochanibeau disposed to assist in the expedition, if it could 
be made practicable ; but, all tlie armed French frigates being then ab- 
sent on diffbrent destinations, it was not possible at that time to pro- 
vide the proper naval force. 

A* 



6 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

On the first notice of the storm, which happened 
on the 22d of January, and of its effects, I intimated 
to the French general the possibility and importance 
of improving the opportunity in an attempt upon Ar- 
nold. When I received a more certain account of the 
total loss of the Culloden, and the dismasting of the 
Bedford, two seventy-four-gun ships belonging to the 
British lleet in Gardiner's Bay, I immediately put in 
motion, under the command of the Marquis de La- 
fayette, as large a part of my small force here, as I 
could with prudence detach, to proceed to the Head 
of Elk, and, with all expedition, made a proposal to 
the Count de Rochambeau and the ChevaUer Des- 
touches for a cooperation in Virginia with the whole 
of the Heet of our allies and a part of their land force. 
Before my proposition arrived, in consequence of an 
application to him from Philadelphia, the Chevalier 
Destouches had sent a ship of the line and two or 
three frigates to the Chesapeake Bay, which not only 
retarded the plan I had proposed (by awaiting their 
return), but ultimately defeated the project ; as the en- 
emy in the mean time remasted the Bedford with the 
masts taken out of the Culloden, and, following the 
French fleet, arrived olF the Capes of Virginia before 
it ; where a naval combat ensued, glorious for the 
French, who were inferior in ships and guns, but un- 
profitable for us, who were disappointed of our object. 

The failure of this expedition, which was most flat- 
tering in the commencement, is much to be regretted ; 
because a successful blow in that quarter would, in all 
probability, have given a decisive turn to our affairs 
in all the southern States ; because it has been attend- 
ed with considerable expense on our part, and much 
inconvenience to the State of Virginia, by the assem- 
bling of its militia ; because the world is disappointed

at not seeing Arnold in gibbets ; and, above all, be- 
cause we stood in need of something to keep us adoat, 
till the result of your mission is known ; for, be as- 
sured, my dear Laurens, day does not follow night 
more certainly, than it brings with it some additional 
proof of the impracticability of carrying on the war 
without the aids you were directed to solicit. As an 
honest and candid man, as a man whose all depends 
on the final and happy termination of the present con- 
test, I assert this, while I give it decisively as my opin- 
ion, that, without a foreign loan, our present force, 
which is but the remnant of an army, cannot be kept 
together this campaign, much less will it be increased 
and in readiness for another. 

The observations contained in my letter of the l.'ith 
of January last are veriticd ever}' moment ; and, if 
France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical 
posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should 
she attempt it hereafter. We are at this hour sus- 
pended in the balance ; not from choice, but from hard 
and absolute necessity ; and you may rely on it as a 
fact, that we cannot transport the provisions from the 
States in which they are assessed to the army, be- 
cause we cannot pay the teamsters, who will no longer 
work for certificates. It is equally certain, that our 
troops are approaching fast to nakedness, and that we 
have nothing to clothe them with ; that our hospitals 
are without medicines and our sick without nutriment 
except such as well men eat ; and that all our public 
works are at a stand, and the artificers disbanding. 
But why need I run into detail, when it may be de- 
clared in r. word, that we are at the end of our tether, 
and that now or never our deliverance must come. 
While, indeed, how easy would it be to retort the en- 
emy's own game upon them, if it could be made to

comport with the general plan of the war to keep a 
superior fleet always in these seas, and France would 
put us in a condition to be active by advancing us 
money. The ruin of the enemy's schemes would then 
be certain ; the bold game they are now playing would 
be the means of efiecting it ; for they would be re- 
duced to the necessity of concentring their force at 
capital points, thereby giving up all the advantages 
they have gained in the southern States, or be vul- 
nerable everywhere. 

Such of the Pennsylvania Hue, as had reassembled 
and were recruited, say about one thousand, were or- 
dered, about the middle of February, to join the south- 
ern ai'my ; and since the disappointment of our enter- 
prise against Arnold, I have directed the detachment 
under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette to 
proceed thither; but how either can march, without 
money or credit, is more than I can tell. With every 
wish for your success, and a safe and speedy return, 
and with every sentiment of esteem and aff'ection, I 
am, dear Sir, &,c. 



TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

New Windsor, 10 April, 1781. 

Sir, 
I had the pleasure of receiving your Excellency's 
letter of the 6th instant only two hours ago. We are 
greatly indebted to the Chevalier Destouches for the 
disposition he shows to undertake the expedition to 
Penobscot, and to you for your readiness to furnish a 
detachment of troops for the same purpose. The ob- 
ject is certainly worthy of our attention, and if it 
can be effected wiU be very agreeable to the States, 



PabtII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. » 

particularly to those of the east. M. Destouches can 
best judge, from the situation of the enemy's lleet, 
how lar it may be attempted with prudence ; and 
your Excellency, from the information you have re- 
cently received, what number of troops will be suf- 
ficient for the enterprise. I am persuaded it will be 
calculated how far it is probable the enemy may follow 
with a part of their fleet ; whether the post can be 
carried by a coup de main, or may require so much 
time as to make it likely the operation will be inter- 
rupted before its conclusion, in case of a superior 
squadron being sent by the enemy ; and what possi- 
bility there is of protection, or a safe retreat for the 
ships, and even for the lanil force, through an unset- 
tled country. All these points arc too important not 
to have been well weighed, and your conversations 
with the Massachusetts deputies will have enlightened 
you upon them. 

The confidence I have in your judgment assures to 
you the concurrence of my sentiments, in whatever you 
may do on the occasion. I will only take the liberty 
to remark two things ; first, that it appears to mc frig- 
ates, without any ships of the line, will answer the 
puqoose as well as with them, and less will be risked 
by dividing the body of the fleet. Frigates, including 
the forty-fours, will afford a safe escort to the troops 
against any thing now in those seas. VVHth respect to 
a detachment from the enemy's fleet, it would always 
be proportioned to the force we should send. If we 
have two sixty-fours, they would even be an object 
for their whole fleet. Secondly, as despatch is essen- 
tial to success, it will in my opinion be advisable not 
to depend on any cooperation of the militia, but to 
send at once such a force from your army, as you 

VOL. VIU. 2 



10 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

deem completely adequate to a speedy reduction of 
the post. 

The country in the neighbourhood of Penobscot is 
too thinly inhabited to afford any resource of militia 
there ; and to assemble and convey them from re- 
mote places would announce your design, retard your 
operations, and give leisure to the enemy to counter- 
act you. Indeed, I would recommend, for the sake 
of secrecy, to conceal your determination from the 
State itself. These hints you will be pleased to make 
use of only so far as they appeal- to be well founded. 
I have the honor to be, &c.* 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 11 April, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 
Your favor dated at Elk the 8th instant reached 
me at ten o'clock last evening. While I give you 
credit for the manoeuvre by which you removed the 

* The Britisli had contrived to keep a fortified post at Penobscot, 
which at this time contained a garrison of about three hundred and 
fifty men. The Council of Massachusetts thought a good opportunity 
now presented itself, while the British fleet was in the Chesapeake, to 
employ the idle hours of the French in an enterprise against Penobscot. 
Proposals to that effect were made through a deputation, and accepted. 
M. Destouclies agreed to furnish two sixty-fours, two frigates, and a 
smaller vessel, and preparations were immediately begun. A land force 
of si.\ hundred men was offered by Count de Rochambeau, and also 
four mortars, and four twenty-four-pounders. The Chevalier de Chas- 
tellu.x was to command. At first it was expected, that Massachusetts 
■would furnish militia ; but this part of the plan was given up, and Count 
de Rochambeau proposed to enlarge his force to eight hundred men. 
After all the arrangements had been put in train, the project was finally 
abandoned, in consequence of the apprehension of M. Destouches, that 
a superior British naval force would come upon some parts of his squad- 
ron while in a divided state. — MS. Letters of Hochambeau and Dts- 
touches, April 6th, 7th, 15th. 



I'AnTll.l THK AMERICAN RKVOLUTION. H 

British ships from before Annapolis, I am sorry, as mat- 
ters are circuiustauced, tliat you have put yourself so 
much fui-ther from the point, which now of necessi- 
ty becomes the object of your destination. Whether 
General Philli[w remains in Virginia or goes further 
southward, he must be opposed by a force more sub- 
stantial than militia alone ; and you will for that rea- 
son immediately open a communication with General 
Greene, inform him of the numbers, situation, and 
probable views of the enemy in Virginia, and take 
his directions as to marching forward to join him, or 
remaining there to keep a watch upon the motions of 
Phillips, should he have formed a junction with Ar- 
nold at Portsmouth.* 

Every difliculty, so far as respects the wants of the 
officers and men, and the uneasinesses, which might 
arise upon their being ordered upon a more distant 
service than they expected, were foreseen, and would 
have been removed by recalling the detachment and 
forming another, had not the reasons of a public na- 
ture, which were mentioned in my letter of the 6th, 
outweighed all private considerations. 

You must endeavour to get shoes from Philadelphia, 
which will be essentially necessary before you can 
move ; and, if you will cause a return to be made of 
such articles, as will probably be wanting in the course 
of the campaign, I will endeavour to forward them from 
hence, with a proportion of any stores, which may have 
been sent on by the States for their troops. If the 
officers will write back to their friends here for any 
additional baggage, of which they may stand in need, 
it shall be forwarded under careful conductors. The 
difficulties, which you will experience on the score of

12 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

provision and transportation, would have been common 
to any other body of troops. They will I know be 
great, but I depend much upon your assiduity and 
activity. 

If the most distant prospect of such an operation as 
you speak of had been in my mind, I should have 
looked upon your detachment as essential to the un- 
dertaking ; but I can assure you, without entering into 
a detail of reasons, which I cannot commit to paper, 
that I have not at present an idea of being able to 
effect such a matter. This had very great weight in 
the determination of the general officers and myself; 
for we should have been very happy in an opportunity 
of succouring the southern states by a diversion, could 
it have been attempted with any tolerable hope of 
success. 

The small remains of the Jersey line seem neces- 
sary to form a head, to which the recruits, if any are 
obtained, may unite themselves. That line stands next 
for detachment, and therefore it is more than proba- 
ble that it may soon become necessary to send the 
whole to the southward. But the reason, which I have 
just mentioned, operates in favor of keeping the re- 
mainder as long as possible. I shall be glad to hear 
from you, as to the time of j'our setting out from Elk, 
your prospects of getting forward, and the temper of 
the troops ; and, above all, I shall ever be happy in 
knoAving that you are well, and that every thing con- 
tributes to your happiness and satisfaction, being very 
truly and sincerely, my dear Mai'quis, &,c.

TO Xm: MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 14 April, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

Your two letters of the 10th came to hand last night. 
In mine of the 11th, I informed you as fully as it was 
prudent to do upon paper, that there was at present 
little or no prospect of an operation in the quarter you 
seem to wish.* The contingencies appeared to me so 
remote, in the conversations I had with Count de Ro- 
chambeau, that I could not justify myself in withdraw- 
ing a detachment already so far advanced towards the 
point in which reUef is immediately and absolutely 
necessary. 

To have sent the detachment by water would cer- 
tainly have been in every respect advantageous ; but, 
even supposing M. Destouches should consent to spare 
the number of ships you mention, would it be safe to 
risk so valuable a body of men, and so unequal a force, 
in the face of the whole British fleet? We cannot 
suppose their intelHgence so bad, but they would have 
notice of the embarkation, and talie measures to in- 
tercept it. 

Congress have received information through General 
Forman, that Sir Henry Clinton means in person to 
take post upon the Delaware at Newcasde. I have 
heard of no preparation at New York for an embarka- 
tion of that consequence, or of any other, and there- 
fore I do not put much confidence in the report, upon 
so large a scale. A party may perhaps be going into 
the Delaware Bay to interrupt the commerce of Phila- 
delphia, and draw suppUes from the disaflfected near 
the shores. I expect to hear of some desertions from 

* a combined attack upon New York.

you in consequence of your move ; but the composi-

upon the service with alacrity, I have no doubt but 
the men will soon forget theu- attachments in this 
quarter, and follow cheerfully. I am, &c.

yourself. I make you the first offer, therefore, of the 
vacant office, and should be happy in your acceptance 
of it. The pay is one hundred dollars a month ; the

New Windor, 1(5 April, 1781. 

Sir 
Previous to the receipt of your letter,* I had di- 
rected the commissary of prisoners to renew a pro- 
posal, which was some time since made to the enemy, 
for exchanging General Burgoyne, and a balance of 
private prisoners due to us, for the residue of our of- 
ficers on Long Island, and as many of the southern 
officers as would make up the dillerence. My motives 
for this proposal were these. General Burgoyne is 
said to be in ill health ; his death w ould deprive us in 
exchanges of the value of one thousand and forty pri- 
vate men, or officers equivalent, according to the tariff 
which has been settled. I thought it advisable not to 
risk so considerable a loss, when his exchange would 
give relief to a number of our officers in captivity, and

return immediately. 

"It is proper to inform your Excellency, that this resolution is adopted 
in consequence of information, that the late President Laurens is con- 
fined in the Tower of London, as a state criminal, under pretext of his 
being guilty of treasonable practices. Should this resolution embarrass 
or impede any measures your Excellency may have adopted relative or 
preparatory to a general exchange of prisoners, it is taken for granted 
that you will please to represent the same to Congress, previously to 
any proceedings for carrying the resolve into execution." — ,^pril Hlh. 

Notice of the above requisition was accordingly communicated to Sir 
Henry Clinton by General Washington, with a request, that the neces- 
sary steps might be taken for a speedy compliance with it In conse-

The moment I received your letter, I wrote to Mr. 
Skinner, countermanding his instructions. I believe 
the countermand will arrive before he has done any 
thing in the matter ; but if it does not, I am persuaded 
the enemy will again reject the proposal. As soon as 
I hear from him, if things are situated as I expect, I 
will execute immediately the order for the recall of 
General Burgoyne. To the best of my recollection, 
all the officers in Europe on parole have been ex-

the action, if we were victorious, and the little injury if otherwise, de- 
termined me to bring on an action as soon as possible. When both par- 
ties are agreed in a matter, all obstacles are soon removed. I thought 
the determination warranted by the soundest principles of good policy, 
and I hope the event will prove it so, though we were unfortunate. I 
regret nothing so much as the loss of my artillery, though it was of 
little use to us, nor can it be, in tliis great wilderness. However, as 
the enemy have it, we must also. 

" I am happy to hear the Marquis de Lafayette is coming to Virginia ; 
though 1 am afraid from a hint in one of Baron Steuben's letters, that 
he will think himself injured in being superseded in the command. Could 
the Marquis join us at this moment, we should have a glorious campaign. 
It would put Lord Cornwallis and his whole army into our hands.

to your lot, I am convinced you deserved tliem. The 
chances of war are various, and the best concerted 
measures, and the most (laltering prospects, may and 
often do deceive us ; especially while we are in the 
power of militia. The motives which induced you to 
seek an action with Lord Cornwallis, are supported 
upon the b.cst military principles ; and the conse- 
quences, if you can prevent the dissipation of your 
troops, will no douht be fortunate. Every support, 
that it is in my power to give you from this army, shall 
cheerfully be atforded ; but if I part with any more 
troops, I must accompany them, or have none to com- 
mand, as there is not at this moment more than a gar- 
rison for VVest Point, nor can I tell when there w ill be. 

I am much pleased to find by your letter, that the 
State of Virginia exerts itself to your satisfaction. My 
public and private letters strongly inculcate the ne- 
cessity of this ; and I have again urged Congress to 
use every means in their power to facilitate the march 
of the Pennsylvania line ; as also to recruit, equip, 
and forward Moylan's dragoons to you with despatch. 

I should be very sorry on any occasion to hurt the 
feelings of Baron Steuben, whom I esteem as a very 
valuable oflicer. But in the instance you have men- 
tioned, there is no cause of complaint ; for, if he will 
advert to his own letters to me, he will find that there 
was a great probability of his having marched with a 
detachment to reinforce you. Besides which there 
was a necessity for sending a general officer with the

detachment from hence, and political considerations, as 
it was to be a combined operation depending upon 
critical circumstances with a French land and sea 
force, pointed to the Marquis de Lafayette. These 
are the facts, the knowledge of which must, I am per- 
suaded, satisfy the Baron. 

I am truly sensible of the merit and fortitude of the 
veteran bands under your command, and wish the 
sentiments I entertain of their worth could be com- 
municated with the warmth I feel them. It was my 
full intention to request you to thank Morgan and the 
gallant troops under his command for their brilliant 
victory ; but the hurry, in which my letters are too 
often written, occasioned the omission at the time I 
acknowledged the official account of that action. 

Your conjecture respecting the cause of the mutiny 
in the Pennsylvania line has more substantial ground 
for its support, than the letter of the member of Con- 
gress ; and I am mistaken if the licentious conduct of 
that Hne was not more the effect of an overcharge 
of spirits, on the 1st of January, than of premeditated 
design. 

I have the pleasure to tell you, that, as far as I am 
acquainted with the opinion of Congress with respect 
to your conduct, it is much in your favor. That this 
is the sentiment of all the southern delegates I have 
great reason to beheve, because I have it declared to 
me in explicit terms by some of them. I have re- 
ceived a letter from Mr. Custis, dated the 29th ulti- 
mo, in which are these words. " General Greene has 
by his conduct gained universal esteem, and possess- 
es in the fullest degree the confidence of all ranks 
of people." He had then just returned from the As- 
sembly at Richmond. I hope the disorder, of Avhich 
you complained, was no other than the effect of over

fatigue, aiul tliat you are now periectly well. That 
successes equal to your merits and wishes may attend 
you, is the ai-dent desire of, dear Sir, &c. 



TO THE MARQUIS UE LAFAYETTE. 

Head-Quarters, 21 April, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

Thoufj;h (he situation of southern affairs would not 
permit me to recall your corps to this army, yet it was 
with great reluctance I could resolve upon seeing you 
separated from head-quarters. My friendship for you 
makes me desirous of having you near me, and there 
will occur frequent occasions in cooperative measures, 
in which it would be of the greatest utility I should 
have it in my power to consult you. These motives 
would have induced me to propose to you to return 
personally to head-quarters, had I not believed you 
would not choose to quit your corps, and had I not 
foreseen a difticulty in giving you a command in the 
remaining troops. A select corps you could not have, 
and there are so many major-generals, who conceive 
themselves in a manner wedded to the different lines, 
and who are to be provided for, that it would not be 
easy at present to accommodate matters to your hav- 
ing a command in the line. But this difliculty might 
be overcome, and I cannot forbear, late as it is, leav- 
ing it at your option to proceed with your corps or 
return personally to head-quarters. If the last should 
be your choice, you will give orders to the officer you 
leave in command to march with all the necessary 
precaution, and take the orders of Baron Steuben. 
You will at the same time write to the Baron, com- 
municating to him your instructions, and to General 
Greene informing him of your return.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [iET. 49. 



If you resolve to proceed forward, I shall have one 
consolation, which is, that from the present aspect of 
things it is perhaps most probable the weight of the 
war this campaign will be in the southern States, and 
it will become my duty to go there in person, where 
I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again. Of 
this I would not have you say any thing. 

^ipril 22(1. — The reasons assigned in some of your 
letters, and others which have occurred to me, chiefly 
of a political nature, assure me that great advantages 
will be derived from your being wherever the French 
army and the American head-quarters ai-e. I there- 
fore not only repeat the offer contained in the enclosed 
letter, but accompany it with a wish, that you may re- 
turn, if you can consistently with your own inclina- 
tion relinquish your present command for the pros- 
pects I have mentioned; not else, as it always has 
been and ever will be my wish to make things as 
agreeable to you as the nature of the service will ad- 
mit. I cannot recall the detachment for reasons, which 
in my judgment are conclusive. The accidents to 
which letters are liable forbid me, miless I could write 
to you in cipher, to go into a fuU explanation of some 
matters, of which you seem not to be well infoi'med, 
and in which I wish to set you right ; but I dare not 
attempt it in a common letter, nor will there be any 
necessity for it if you return.* 

* Lafayette to Washington. — "A letter from you, relating to the de- 
lays of the French, makes a great noise at Philadelphia. Indeed, it 
gives me pain on many political accounts. There are many confidential 
conmiunications, which you once requested from me, and which my pe- 
culiar situation with both sides of the alliance would enable me to make ; 
but having been ordered from you, and many things I had to say not 
being of a nature, which would render it prudent to commit them to pa- 
per, these personal services must be out of the question, so long as the 
war continues in Carolina." — Susquehanna Ferry, April 15th. 



Part III '''UK A M K R If A N REVOLUTION. 21 

I am very sorry, that any letter of mine should be 
the subject of public discussion, or give the smallest 
uneasiness to any person living. The letter, to which 
I presume you allutle, was a confidential one from me 
to Mr. Lund Washington, with whom I have lived in 
{)erfect intimacy for nearly twenty years. I can neither 
avow the letter, as it is published by Rivington, nor 
declare that it is spurious, because my letter to this 
gentleman was written in great haste, and no copy of 
it was taken. All I remember of the matter is, that, 
at the time of writing it, I was a good deal chagrined 
to find by your letter of tlie 15th of March, from 
Yorktown in Virginia, that the French fleet had not at 
that time appeared within the Capes of the Chesa- 
peake ; and I meant ui strict confidence to express my 
apprehensions and concern for the delay. But as we 
know that the alteration of a single word does often- 
times pervert the sense, or give a force to the expres- 
sion, unintended by the letter-writer, I should not be 
surprised if Rivington, or the inspectors of his gazette, 
have taken that liberty with the letter in question ; 
especially as he or they have, I am told, published a 
letter from me to Governor Hancock and his answer, 
which never had an existence but in the gazette. 
That the enemy fabricated a number of letters for me 
formerly is a fact well known ; that they are not less 
capable of doing it now, few will deny. As to his as- 
serting, that this is a genuine copy of the original, he 
well knows that their friends do not want to convict 
him of a fiilsehood, and that ours have not the op- 
portunity of doing it, though both sides know his tal- 
ents for lying.*

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 22 AprU, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 
I have received your several letters, and am ex- 
tremely concerned at the temper of your detachment, 
and the desertions that are taking place. I imagine 
however that these would have been nearly as great 

ington's Royal Gazelle, April 4th, and contained tlie following extract. 
"It was unfortunate (but this I mention in confidence) that the French 
fleet and detachment did not undertake the enterprise they are now 
upon, when I first proposed it to them. The destruction of Arnold's 
corps would then have been inevitable before the British fleet could 
have put to sea. Instead of this, the small squadron which took the 
Romulus and other vessels was sent, and could not, as I foretold, do 
any thing without a land force at Portsmouth." The same ideas, in 
nearly the same language, are expressed in the letter to General Schuy- 
ler, March 23d, attached to which wUl be found an explanatory note.

ington and his aid-de-camp Colonel Hamilton. The particulars may be

From Lafmjeth^s Letter. — " Considering the footing I am upon with 
your Excellency, it would perhaps appear to you strange, that I never 
mentioned a circumstance, whicli lately happened in your family. I was 
the first who knew of it, and from that moment exerted every means in 
my power to prevent a separation, which I knew was not agreeable to 
your Excellency. To this measure I was prompted by affection for you ; 
but I thought it was improper to mention any thing about it, until you 
were pleased to impart it to me." — April 15th

in any other corps that miglit have been sent, and, after 
the Pennsylvania lino, I think it woulil be ineli^il)le to 
detach any other State line. We lind by experience, 
that they are not only dissipated on the march, l>ut, 
being at a great distance Iroiii their States, are almost 
entiifly neglected. Few recruits are raised lor thera, 
anil these few are lost on the way. We see how to- 
tally the Maryland line has declined, and how little is 
doing to reestablish it ; a line formerly among tlir most 
numerous and respectable in the army. Our plan at 
present appears to me to be to commit the defence of 
the southern States to the States as far as Pennsyl- 
vania inclusive, and to make up by detachment any 
additional succours, that may be necessary. We must 
endeavour to compensate these detachments for the 
loss of State supplies by giving them a larger propor- 
tion of Continental. On this principle I am sending to 
you the articles mentioned in the enclosed list ; twelve 
hundred shirts, twelve hundred linen overalls, twelve 
hundred pairs of shoes, twelve hundred pairs of socks, 
and one hundred hunting-shirts, which set out two 
days ago from this place. I have also urged the Board 
of War to do their best for you. 

Colonel Vosc shall be relieved. If there is any good 
ofTicer of an eastern line here desirous of the com- 
mand, he nmst have it. I mentioned to you, that I 
had a warm remonstrance soon after your departure 
from the Massachusetts line, on the manner of appoint- 
mg officers for your corps. If there should be no of- 
ficer of the proper rank desirous of the command, I 
shall be glad to employ Lieutenant-Colonel Smith. I 
will see what can be done in the case of Major Galvan. 
I wish at all events to retain Gimat ; but it will be 
difficult to remove the one without the other. 

It appears to me extraordinary, that your ad\ices 



24 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGb. [^t. 40. 

should have given you an idea so different from the 
whole complexion of the intelligence I had received, 
concerning the probability of a certain event.* This, 
and the situation of our own force, have induced me 
to regard it as barely possible ; too precarious to enter 
far into our dispositions ; possible only in a case, which 
we are not authorized to expect will happen.f I dare 
not trust the details on which this opinion is founded 
to paper. 

The danger to the southern States is immediate and 
pressing. It is our duty to give them support. The 
detachment with you, all circumstances considered, was 
the most proper for the purpose. The project, which 
General Greene has lately adopted, adds a particular 
motive to continuing its destination. It is essential to 
him, that Phillips should be held in check ; and we 
cannot wholly rely on militia for this. As to a trans- 
portation by water, while the enemy command the 
Chesapeake and Cape Fear, I do not see how it is 
practicable. The only cause of hesitation in my mind, 
about sending your corps to the southward, w^as a 
separation from you. I refer you to private letters 
accompanying this, one written previously to your last, 
the other subsequently. As to our force here, you 
know what it was when you left us, and you will know 
what it is now, when I tell you that we have as yet 
but few recruits. The enemy's present force of regu-

not likely to happen, though the views of the French court had not as 
yet been received through any direct channel. Colonel Laurens wrote 
from Paris, on the 11th of April, that "the ministry did not seem to ap- 
prove of the siege of New York as an operation for the ensuing cam- 
paign." The letter containing this intelligence could not have been re- 
ceived by Washington at the date of the above to Lafayette.

services. 

You were right, my dear Marquis, in supposing that 
no explanation could be necessary as to your letter to 
the Board of Wai-. I know your sentiments and your 
friendship. I shall not detain the express to enlarge 
on the other subjects of your letters. I will embrace 
the first safe opportunity to give you a full view of 
our affairs, what we are, and what we expect to be, 
that you may regulate your future correspondence with 
your court accordingly. Hitherto I could give you 
nothing material, more than you know, as to ourselves.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE ROGERS CLARK. 

New Windsor, 25 April, 1781. 

Sir, 

At the request of Governor Jefferson, I have already 
given orders to the commandant at Fort Pitt to afford 
you every assistance in his power, in the prosecution of 
your intended expedition.* A few days ago I received 
a piece of intelligence from New York, which it may 
be material for you to know. It is, that Colonel Con- 
nolly, who formerly lived upon the Ohio, who was 
taken in the year 1775, and lately exchanged, is to 
proceed to Quebec, as soon as the season will permit, 
with as many refugees as he can collect at New York ; 
that he is to join Sir John Johnson in Canada; and 

• See the letter to Colonel Brodhead, dated December 29th, 1780.

that they are to proceed, with their united forces, by 
the route of Birch Island and Lake Ontario to Ve- 
nango. Their object is to be Fort Pitt and the west- 
ern posts. It is also said, that Connolly carries blank 
commissions, which are to be given to persons already 
in the country, and that there are several hundred 
persons now in the neighbourhood of Fort Pitt, who 
are to join him. As this last corresponds with a sus- 
picion, which Colonel Brodhead entertains, I have writ- 
ten to him to take measures to secure or remove 
every suspected person. I am. Sir, &c. 



TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

New Windsor, 27 April, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter of this date has not a litde embarrassed 
me.* You must remember the ferment in the Penn- 
sylvania hne the last campaign, occasioned by the ap- 
pointment of Major Macpherson, and you know the 
uneasiness that at this moment exists among the east- 
em troops on account of the commands conferred upon 
Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan, although it was the 
result of absolute necessity. 

Should circumstances admit of the formation of an- 
other advanced corps, of which I see very litde pros- 
pect from present appearances, it can be but small, 
and must be composed almost entirely of eastern 
troops ; and to add to the discontents of the officers 
of those lines by the further appointment of an officer

of your rank to (lie comiuaiKl of it, or in it, would, I 
ani certain, involve nie in a diiriculty of a very dis- 
agrecat)Io and delicate nature, and niiujht perhaps lead 
to conseciuences more serious than it is easy to imag- 
ine. Wiiile I adhere firmly to the right of making 
such appointments as you request, I am at the same 
time obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that 
right too far, more especiall} in a service like ours, and 
at a time so critical as the present. 

I am convinced, that no officer can with justice dis- 
pute your merit and abilities. The opposition hereto- 
fore made has not been for the want of those quali- 
fications in the gentlemen, who are and have been the 
objects of discontent. The officers of the line con- 
tend, without having reference to particular persons, 
that it is a hardship and reflection upon them to in- 
troduce brevet officers into commands, of some per- 
manence, in which there are more opportunities of 
distinguishing themselves, than in the line of the army 
at lai'ge, and with the men they have had the trouble 
to discipline and prepare for the field. 

My principal concern arises from an apprehension, 
that you will impute my refusal of your request to 
other motives, than those I have expressed ; but I beg 
you to be assured I am only influenced by the rea- 
sons, which I have mentioned. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

the occasion of that part of your letter of the 26th 
instant, which relates to an intercepted letter of mine

published by the enemy.* I am unhappy that an ac- 
cident should have put it in their power to give to the 
world any thing from me, which may contain an impli- 
cation the least disagreeable to you, or to the Chevalier 
Destouches. I assm-e you sincerely, that I have no 
copy of the original letter in my possession, so that I 
am unable by a comparison to determine how far the 
publication may be just. The enemy have fabricated 
w hole letters for me, and even a series of letters ; and 
it is not improbable that they may have given a different 
turn to some of my expressions in the present instance. 
It would however be disingenuous in me not to ac- 
knowledge, that I believe the general import to be true. 
The copy, however, which your Excellency has sent to 
me, differs in some respects from that which the enemy 

* After quoting the extract from the letter to Lund Washington (copied 
above in the note to a letter to tlie Marquis de Lafayette, April 22d), 
Count de Rochambeau said ; 

" If tliis was really written by your Excellency, I shall beg leave to 
observe, that the result of this reflection would seem to be, that we have 
had here the choice of two expeditions proposed, and that we have pre- 
ferred the less to a more considerable undertaking, which your Excellency 
desired. If such is the meaning, I beg your Excellency to call to mind, 
that the line-of-battle ship and the two frigates went out of Newport on 
tlie 9th of February, on a demand made by Congress and the State of 
Virginia to the Chevalier Destouches ; that your letter, with the plan for 
the going out of the whole fleet with a detachment of one thousand 
Frenchmen to act conjointly with the Marquis de Lafayette, bears date 
the 15th; that I did not receive it till the 19th ; that, having given an 
instant communication of it to M. Destouches, I had the honor on the 
20tli to send his answer to your Excellency ; and that, no later than the 
day after the gale of wind, which weakened the British fleet towards the 
end of January, by the loss of the Culloden, I oflTered all the land forces 
that could possibly be transported by the navy, and have not ceased to 
do it since. I shall not mention to you the reasons, that delayed the de- 
parture of M. Destouches's squadron, because they do not come under my 
cognizance. I only state these facts to call to your mind these dates, 
which I beg you to verify by your correspondence, that you may be en- 
tirely persuaded, that tliere will never be the least delay in what concerns

I shall receive them." — 3/5. Letter, April 26(/i.

have piil)IislR'd, as you will perceive by llie enclosed 
Gazette. Whatever construction it may bear, 1 beg 
your Excellency will consider tlie letter as private to 
a friend, a gendeman who has the direction of my af- 
fairs at home, totally unconnected with public allairs, 
and on whose discretion I could absolutely rely. No 
iiiea of the same kind has ever gone to any public 
body. 

When I say, that I believe the general import of the 
publication to be true, I mean it in this sense, that there 
did appear to me a degree of delay in executing the 
enterprise suggested by me, of the causes of which 
I was not well apprized, and an idea of tliis kind was 
probably expressed in my letter to Mr. Washington. 
As to the apparent insinuation, that the first expedition 
had been preferred to the one proposed by me, I could 
not have intended to convey it, in its fullest latitude, 
because it would have been unjust. I could not but 
have recollected, that my formal proposal did not reach 
you till after the departure of the first squadron, though 
the suggestion of it was previous. ]My letter however 
was written in haste, and might have been inaccurately 
expressed. I have lately learnt, though not otlicially, 
that the cause of the delay I have alluded to was a 
want of supplies for the fleet. Impressed with a real 
esteem for and confidence in the Chevalier Destouches, 
I have heard this circumstance with satisfaction. 

With this explanation, I leave the matter to his can- 
dor and to yours, and flatter myself it will make no 
impressions inconsistent with an entire persuasion of 
my sincere esteem and attachment. I have the honor 
to be, with perfect respect, &,c.*

Dear Sir, 

Fully impressed with the idea of the utility of early, 
regular, and accurate communication of the kind in con- 
templation, I shall make no difficulty in acceding to the 
proposal contained in your private letter from Newport. 
But at the same time that I am engaging in behalf of the 
United States a liberal reward for the services of the 

C s,* of whose fidelity and ability I entertain a high 

opinion, it is certainly but reasonable, from patriotism 
and every other principle, that their exertions should be 
proportionably great, to subserve essentially the interest 
of the public. All the interior and minute arrangements 
of the correspondence I request that you will settle 
with them as expeditiously and advantageously as may 
be, and especially that you will urge, in very forcible 
terms, the necessity of having the communication as 
circumstantial, frequent, and expeditious as possible. 

The great objects of information you are very well 
acquainted with ; such as arrivals, embarkations, prepa- 
rations for movements, alterations of positions, situations 
of posts, fortifications, garrisons, strength or weakness 
of each, distribution and sti*ength of corps, and, in gen- 
eral, every thing which can be interesting and impor- 
tant for us to know. 

Besides these, you are also sensible there are many 
things upon a smaller scale, which are necessary to be

this alone would be a work of much time and great magnitude. It may 
suffice to give the sum of them, which I shall do in a few words. In- 
stead of having magazines filled with provisions, we have a scanty pit- 
tance scattered here and there in the dilTcrcnt States ; instead of havin" 
our arsenals well supplied with military stores, they are poorly provided 
and the workmen all leaving them ; instead of having the various articles 
of field-equipage in readiness to bo delivered, the quartermaster-goneral, 
as the dernier resort, according to Iiis account, is but now applying to 
the several States to provide these things for their troops respectively ; 
instead of having a regular system of transportation established upon 
credit, or funds in the quartermaster's hands to defray the contingent ex- 
penses of it, we have neither tlie one nor the other, and all that business, 
or a great part of it, being done by military impress, we are daily and 
hourly oppressing the people, souring their tempers, and alienating their 
affections ; instead of having the regiments completed to the new estab- 
lishment, which ought to have been done agreeably to the requisitions 
of Congress, scarce any Slate in tlie Union has at tliis hour an eighth 
part of its quota in the field, and little prospect that I can see of ever

most concern is, that you should go on board the en- 
emy's vessels, and furnish them with refreshments. It 
would have been a less painful circumstance to me to 
have heard, that in consequence of your non-compliance 
with their request, they had burnt my house and laid 
the plantation in ruins. You ought to have considered 
yourself as my representative, and should have reflect- 
ed on the bad example of communicating with the en- 
emy, and making a voluntary ofler of refreshments to 
them with a view to prevent a conflagration. 

It was not in your power, I acknowledge, to prevent 
them from sending a flag on shore, and you did right to 
meet it ; but you should, in the same instant that the 
business of it was unfolded, have declared explicitly, 
that it was improper for you to yield to the request; 
after which, if they had proceeded to help themselves 
by force, you could but have submitted ; and, being 
unprovided for defence, this was to be preferred to a 
feeble opposition, which only serves as a pretext to 
bum and destroy. 

I am thoroughly persuaded, that you acted from your 
best judgment, and believe, that your desire to pre- 
serve my property, and rescue the buildings from im- 
pending danger, was your governing motive ; but to 
go on board their vessels, carry them refreshments, 
commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels, and 
request a favor by asking a surrender of my negroes, 
was exceedingly ill judged, and, it is to be feared, will 
be unhappy in its consequences, as it will be a prece- 

getting more than half; in a word, instead of liaving every tiling in readi- 
ness to take the field, we have nothing ; and, instead of having the pros- 
pect of a glorious offensive campaign before us, we have a bewildered 
and gloomy defensive one, unless we should receive a powerful aid of 
ships, land troops, and money from our generous allies, and these at pres- 
ent are too contingent to build upon."

dent for others, and may become a subject of animad- 
version. 

I have no i.loul)t of the enemy's intention to prose- 
cute the phuulering plan they have begun ; and unless 
a stop can be put to it, by the arrival of a superior na- 
val force, I have as little doubt of its ending in the loss 
of all my negroes, and in the destruction of my houses ; 
but I am ]M-epared for the event ; under the prospect 
of which, if you could deposit in a place of safety the 
most valuable and least bulky articles, it might be con- 
sistent with policy antl prudence, and a means of pre- 
serving them herealter. Such and so many things as 
are necessary for common and present use must be 
retained, and must run their chance through the fiery 
trial of this summer. I am sincerely yours. 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 4 May, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

The freedom of your communications is an evidence 
to me of the sincerity of your attachment ; and every 
fresh instance of this gives pleasure and adds strength 
to the bond, which unites us in friendship. In this 
light I view the intimation respecUng the conduct of 
Mr. Lund Washington. Some days previous to the re- 
ceipt of your letter, which only came to my hands yes- 
terday, I received an account of this transaction from 
that gentleman himself, and immediately wrote and for- 
warded the answer, of which the enclosed is a copy. 
This letter, which was written in the moment of my 
obtaining the first intimation of the matter, may be con- 
sidered as a testimony of my disapprobation of his 
conduct, and the transmission of it tn you, as a proof 

VOL. viii. .5 



34 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt. 4i). 

of my friendship ; because I wish you to be assured, 
that no man can condemn the measure more sincerely 
than I do. 

A false idea, arising from the consideration of his be- 
ing my steward, and in that character more the trustee 
and guardian of my property than the representative 
of my honor, has misled his judgment and plunged him 
into error, upon the appearance of desertion among my 
negroes, and danger to my buildings ; for sure I am, 
that no man is more firmly opposed to the enemy than 
he is. From a thorough conviction of this, and of his 
mtegrity, I entrusted every species of my property to 
his care, without reservation or fear of his abusing it. 
The last paragraph of my letter to him was occasioned 
by an expression of his fear, that all the estates con- 
venient to the river would be stripped of their negroes 
and movable property. 

I am very happy to find, that desertion had ceased, 
and content had taken place, in the detachment you 
command. Before this letter can reach you, you 
must have taken your ultimate resolution upon the 
proposal contained in my letters of the 21st and 22d 
ultimo, and have made the consequent arrangements. 
I shall be silent, therefore, on the subject of them ; and 
only beg, in case you should not return to this army, 
and the papers were not lost with your other baggage 
(on which event give me leave to express my concern), 
that you would permit Mr. Capitaine to furnish me 
with copies of the drafts, and the remarks of the pilots 
(taken at Colonel Dey's) on the entrance of the har- 
bour of New York. It is possible they may be want- 
ed ; and I am not able to furnish them without your 
assistance. 

Mrs. Washington, and the rest of my small family, 
which at present consists only of Tilghman and Hum-

phreys, join me in cordial salutations ; and, with sen- 
timents of the purest esteem and most aflectionate re- 
gard, I remain, my dear Maiquis, &lc. 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 5 May, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

I have received with exceeding great satisfaction and 
pleasure your favor of the 18th of April,* and am ex- 
tremely rejoiced to learn, that the spirit of discontent 
had so entirely subsided, and that the pracdce of de- 
sertion would probably be totally stopped among the 
troops under your command. The measures you had 
taken to obtain, on your own credit, a supply of cloth- 
ing and necessaries for the detachment, must entitle you 
to all their gratitude and aflection ; and will, at the 
same time that it endears your name, if possible, still 
more to this country, be an everlasting monument of 
your ardent zeal and attachment to its cause, and the 
establishment of its independence. For my own part, 
my dear Marquis, although I stood in need of no new 
proofs of your exertions and sacrifices in the cause of 
America, I will confess to you, that I shall not be able 
to express the pleasing sensations I have experienced 
at your unparalleled and repeated instances of gener- 
osity and zeal for the service on every occasion. Suf- 
fer me only to pursue you with my sincerest wishes, 
that your success and glory may always be equal to 
your merits. 

I was troubled to be informed of the loss of your 
baggage, but am happy to find, that your private and 
interesting papers were not with it. Should the map

of the harbour of New York, with remarks made on it 
by the pilots, not have been lost, I could wish you would 
be so obliging as to forward it or a copy to me by some 
safe conveyance, as it may be eventually advantageous 
to have it here. Colonel Tupper, who goes to relieve 
Colonel Vose, will have the honor to deliver this letter 
to you. I am, &c. 



TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

New Windsor, 10 May, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Major-General Heath, second in command, and an 
officer whose high rank and consideration entitle him 
to particular notice and attention, is prevailed upon to 
proceed to the several eastern States, to represent the 
present distresses of the army for want of provision, 
and the consequences which must inevitably ensue, un- 
less a more regular system and more vigorous measures 
for aflbrding supplies are speedily adopted. 

From the post of Saratoga to that of Dobbs's Ferry 
inclusive, I believe there is not (by the returns and re- 
ports I have received) at this moment one day's supply 
of meat for the army on hand. Our whole dependence 
for this article is on the eastern States ; their resources 
I am persuaded are ample. To request and urge that 
they may be drawn forth regularly, and to be informed 
with precision and certainty what may absolutely be 
depended upon through the campaign, are the objects 
of this application. 

I have already made representations to the States, of 
the want of provisions, the distress of the army, and 
the innumerable embarrassments we have suffered in

consequence ; not merely once or t\\ ice, but have re- 
iteraleil them over and over again. 1 have struggled 
to the utmost of my ability to keep the aiiny together, 
but all will be in vain wiliiout the efl'ectual assistance 
ol" the States. I have now only to repeat the alterna- 
tive, which has been so often urged, that supplies, par- 
ticul;u-ly of beef-cattle, must be speedily and regui;u-ly 
provided, or our posts cannot be maintained, nor the 
nnny la-pt in ihe held much longer. I entreat your 
Excellency, that this representation may be received in 
the serious light it is meant and deserves, or that I may 
stand exculpated from the dreadful consequences, which 
must otherwise inevitably follow in a very short time. 
I enter not into the detail of matters, as General Heath 
will be able to give your Excellency every necessary 
mformalion, as well as to lay the proper estmiates of 
supplies for the campaign before you. I am, &,c.* 



TO JOHN SULLIVAX, Ii\ CONGRESS. 

New Windsor, 11 May, 1781. 

Dkar Sir, 
Not having seen or heard of any resolve of Congress 
for establishing the principles of promotion in the army, 
I am apprehensive that the report of the committee, 
who had this matter under consideration, is now sleep- 
ing in Congress. This, and a recent instance in the 
Pennsylvania regiment of ai'tillery in proof of the ab- 
solute necessity of adopting some mode, by which the 
whole army may be bound, and a stop thereby be put 
to those disputes, which keep it in a continual state of 
distraction and discontent, are the reasons for my troub- 

• Sent as a circular to each of the eastern States.

38 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

ling you again on this subject, and praying that some 
decision may be come to by Congress. It is much 
easier to avoid disagreements, than to remove discon- 
tents ; and I again declare, that if my difTering in sen- 
timent from the opinions of the committee in some 
points has been the occasion of delay, I would, rather 
than have the matter lie over a moment, yield a free 
assent to all their propositions ; for any principle is bet- 
ter than none. I also wish, though this is more a mat- 
ter of private than public consideration, that the busi- 
ness could be taken up on account of Mr. Tilghman, 
whose appointment seems to depend upon it ; for, if 
there are men in the army deserving the commission 
proposed for him, he is one of them. 

This gendeman came out a captain of one of the 
light infantry companies of Philadelphia, and served in 
the flying camp in 1 776. In August of the same year 
he joined my family, and has been in every action in 
which the main army was concerned. He has been a 
zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithfid 
assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of 
which time he refused to receive pay. Honor and 
gratitude interest me in his favor, and make me so- 
licitous to obtain his commission. His modesty and 
love of concord placed the date of his expected com- 
mission at the 1st of April, 1777, because he would 
not take rank of Hamilton and Meade, who were de- 
clared aids in order (which he did not choose to be) 
before that period, although he had joined my family, 
and done all the duties of one, from the 1st of Sep- 
tember preceding. 

My public letters to Congress will have informed you 
of the situation of this army, and I have no scruple in 
giving it as my decided opinion, that, unless a capital 
change takes place soon, it will be impossible for me 



I'ahtII] Til K AMERICAN R K V O h U T I O N. 39 

to maintain our posts, and keep tiie ai-niy liom dis- 
pLM-sing. 

The resolution of Congress to appoint ministers of 
war, forei;^n alV.iirs, and linance, gave, as far as I was 
able to learn the sentiments of men in and out of the 
army, universal satisfaction. Postponing the lir>t, de- 
laying the second, and disagreeing about the third, have 
had the directly contrary ellect ; and I can venture 
to assure you, not from random guess or vague infor- 
mation, that the want of an able financier, and of a 
proper plan for the disposition of foreign loans, will be 
a greater bar to the obtaining of them than perhaps 
Congress are aware. I could say more on this subject, 
were I at liberty ; but I shall only add, that there is 
not in my opinion a moment to be lost in placing a 
proper chiu-acter at the head of our finance, that he 
may as soon as possible enter upon the duties of his 
office. I am, &,c. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Head-Quarters, New Windsor, 11 May, 1781. 

Dkak Sir, 
I am pleased to hear so flattering accounts of the 
prospects of obtaining men and some kinds of sup- 
plies ; but so great are my apprehensions, on the score 
of provisions, that I am sending General Heath pur- 
posely to the eastern States to represent our distress- 
es, and to endeavour to fix a plan for our regular 
supply in future. I refer you to him for particulars, 
which I do not choose to trust to paper. After Gen- 
eral Heath has finished this business, his private af- 
fairs will detain him some time at home ; and, as he 
will be able at the same time to attend to what you 



40 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

have at present in charge, you may, upon his return 
from New Hampshire to Boston, come to the army. 
You will have my warmest thanks for the zeal, with 
which you have promoted and forwarded every meas- 
ure tending to the good of the service. I am, &c. 



TO COUNT DE BARRAS. 

New Windsor, 14 May, 1781. 

Sir, 
I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
letter of the 11th instant. Give me leave to congratu- 
late you on your safe arrival, and your appointment to 
the command of his Most Christian Majesty's fleet and 
sea forces upon these coasts. It affords me no small 
degree of pleasui'e to find the command devolve upon 
an officer of your Excellency's distinguished character. 
I have appointed Monday, the 21st of this month, for 
the time of our interview at Weathersfield ; and I shall 
very impatiently wait for the opportunity of convincing 
you personally, that I am, &.c.* 



* From the letter of Count de Barras. — "I have the honor to announce 
to your Excellency my arrival at Boston, on the 6th of tliis month, in the 
frigate Concord ; the King having appointed me to the command of his 
squadron in these seas. I arrived here yesterday. The Count de Ro- 
chambeau has communicated to me the letter, which he had the honor to 
■write to your Excellency, requesting an interview. When he shall re- 
ceive your answer, we will conform to your decision. I am very impa- 
tient to have the honor of making an acquaintance witli you, and to 
assure you that I have nothing so much at heart as to render myself ser- 
viceable to the King and to the United States." — JVewport, Ma;/ Uth. 

Count de Rochambeau had written, in communicating the intelligence 
of the arrival of Count de Barras at Boston; — "I believe it will be ne- 
cessary, as soon as we have received our despatches, that we should have 
a conference with your Excellency. By tlie next express I shall inform 
you of it. Your Excellency may, however, tix upon the place for our 
meeting. The Commodore is about si.xty years of age, a particular friend

TO rilll.Il' SCUrYLF.K. 

New Windsor, 14 May, 1781. 

Di;ak Sik, 
I am glad to find, that you have received the neces- 
sary papers, and are entering upon the measures for 
intcrrfpting the enemy's communications. I hope you 
will be enabled, by the assistance of the person pro- 
posed, if he is found sufficiently laithful and intelligent, 
to prosecute those measures to good effect ; because I 
think the intelligence obtained through that channel 

of Count d'Estainnr, and conimandod liis vanjruard when he forced tlic 
entrance of tins harbour." — .Yewport, May SIh. 

The foUon-ing is an extract from the instructions sent by the Minister 
of War to Count dc Rochambeau, dated Versailles, Alarch 7th. 

" 1. It is the intention of his Miijosty, tliat you do not abandon Rhode 
Island, if the squadron destined to act in concert with you for its defence 
cannot retire to Boston without hazard, or before it shall be relieved from 
its defensive position at Rhode Island by a superior naval force. 

" 2. I will inform you, that, in the month of July or August, the supe- 
rior naval force of which you have just received notice, will withdraw the 
squadron of M. de Barras from the harbour of Rhode Island ; and you 
will carefully reserve to yourself the knowledge of this arrangement, 
which may bo accelerated. 

"3. If, by unforeseen events, or any cause whatever, the army of 
Washington should be broken up and dispersed, it is the intention of the 
King, that, under these circumstances, you should decline acceding to 
any orders or requests of that general to penetrate into the interior of 
the continent ; as in ttiat case it would be prudent to reserve yourself, 
and to retire to the Antilles if possible, or to St Domingo, according to 
the season. 

"4. If, on the contrary, the American army remains in its present 
slate, and yet without being able to undertake any combined operation 
with the squadron ; and if this latter should attempt any other enterprise, 
where the concurrence of a certain number of land forces would be re- 
quired, the King leaves it in your power to furnish them, provided that 
the plan be concerted with tlie American general. 

" 5. Should there be an opportunity for tlie squadron at Rhode Island 
to act independently of the American army, you are aware that the naval 
forces of tlie King should concur in all operations, which are considered 
advantageous to the common cause. 

" 6. You arc also aware, that, as long as the King's troops occupy

may be depended upon, and will eventually be of very 
great consequence to us. Much, I apprehend, is to be 
dreaded from the predatory incursions of the enemy 
this campaign. To be apprized of their designs, and 
guarded against them at all points, as far as possible, 
will tend most essentially to disconcert their plans and 
protect our frontiers. As to the disposition of the 
Vermontese, I know nothing of it, but from report. 
At present they are at least a dead weight upon us. 
It is greatly to be regretted, that they are not by some 
means or other added to our scale, as their numbers, 
strength, and resources, would certainly aid us very 
considerably, and make the enemy extremely cautious 
how they advanced far in that quarter. The bulk of 
the people, I am persuaded, must be well affected. 
Should it be otherwise with any of the individuals, I ar- 
dently wish they may be detected in their villany, and 
brought to the punishment they deserve.* 

Rhode Island, the transports destined to receive the troops are to be 
kept there ; when, on the contrary, the army under your command shall 
penetrate into tlie country, and the squadron abandons Rhode Island, 
this squadron will proceed to Boston, and take with it the transports, 
that have been retained. 

"7. If, from the different causes mentioned, you should remain in 
your position at Rhode Island, and a superior naval force of the King 
sliould withdraw the squadron which is in that port, I give you notice, 
tliat the Count de Grasse has orders to leave with you two vessels to 
defend the port, and the transports necessary for your army." 

* The British had come up Lake Champlain from Canada, and threat- 
ened an invasion of the frontiers of New York in that direction. At the 
same time there seemed to be an understanding of some sort between 
the leaders in Vermont and the British officers, which excited a suspicion 
that the former were acting under disguise, and fostering an improper 
intercourse with the enemy. General Schuyler had said in his letter; 

" The conduct of the Vermontese is mysterious, and if the reports 
which generally prevail are well founded, their measures will certainly 
be attended with dangerous consequences to this and the other United 
States. I cannot however believe that the bulk of the people are in the 
secret. I rather conjecture that the person whom we suspected last year 
to have been in New York, and some others, are the only culpable ones,

I have boeii exceedingly distressed by the repeated 
accounts I have received of the suHerings of the troops 
on the frontier, and the terriljle consequences which 
must ensue, unless they were speedily supplied. Wliat 
gave a particular poignancy to the sting I felt on the 
occasion was my inability to aflbrd relief. Such partial 
supplies as were on hand, to the very last barrel of 
meat, I ordered instantly to be sent, and have promised 
General Clinton what further succour the States will 
enable me to give. Major-General Heath has gone to 
the several eastern States, to enforce my pointed rep- 
resentations, to rouse them to more vigorous exertions, 
and to make arrangements for supplies during the 

and that they amuse the people witli making them believe that the whole 
of their negotiation with General Haldiniand is merely calculated to give 
Congress and tliis State the alarm, that the independence of Vermont 
may be acknowledged. 

" I was anxious for ceding the jurisdiction beyond a twenty-mile line 
from Hudson's River, that their independence might be immediately ac- 
knowledged, and they made useful to the common cause ; but the gov- 
ernor put a stop to the business, ' as the aftair was referred to the decision 
of Congress.' I sincerely wish they would speedily decide, acknowledge 
tliera independent, and admit them into the union. If this was instantly 
done, the measures of tlieir leaders would be brought to the test, and 
we should know if they had only tended to bring about their indepen- 
dence, or to connect themselves with the enemy. But, unless Con- 
gress are pushed to a decision, I believe tliey will do notliing in it ; but 
who is to urge them, I know not. The governor cannot do it official- 
ly, and our delegates, I believe, will not, unless they believe that the de- 
cision will go against the Vel-montese."— J»/S. Letter, Saratoga, May 4th. 

The old feuds between the inhabitants of the New Hampshire Grants 
and New York had been kept alive by the refusal of New York to assent 
to the indep°ndence of tlie territory embracing those Grants, which had 
been recently called f'ermont. The party dissensions in Congress had 
prevented a decision by that body, and in tlie mean time the people of 
Vermont set up a government of their own, and the leaders were deter- 
mined not to submit on any terms to tlie domination of Now York. In 
this state of mind the enemy tampered with them, and lioped for a time 
to bring tlicm over. The attempt failed, and it appeared in the end, that 
there was never any serious intention on tlie part of the Vermontesc to 
listen to the British proposals. The subject is explained in Sparks's Life 
of Ethan .men.

TO THE CHEVALIER PAUL JONES. ' 

New Windsor, 15 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

My partial acquaintance with either our naval or com- 
mercial affairs makes it altogether impossible for me to 
account for the unfortunate delay of those articles of 
miUtary stores and clothing, which I have been inform- 
ed have been so long provided in France. If I had 
had any particular reason to suspect you of being 
accessory to that delay, which I assure you was not 
the case, my suspicions would have been removed by 
the very full and satisfactory answers, which you have, 
to the best of my judgment, made to the questions 
proposed to you by the Board of Admiralty, and up- 
on which that Board have in their report to Congress 
testified the high sense, which they entertain of your 
merits and services. 

Whether our naval affairs have been well or ill con- 
ducted, it would be presumptuous in me to determine. 
Instances of bravery and good conduct in several of 
our officers have not been wanting. Delicacy forbids 
me to mention the particular one, which has attracted 
the admiration of all the world, and influenced a most 
illustrious monarch to confer a mark of his favor, that 
can be attained only by a long and honorable service, 
or by the performance of some brilliant action. That 
you may long enjoy the reputation you have so justly 
acquired, is the sincere wish of Sir, &c.*

causes, there had been an extraordinary delay in sending out tiie military

TO EZKA SXILKS, PK£SIDKM' OF YALK COI.LKGE. 

New Windsor, 15 May, ITril. 

Sir, 
For the honor conferred on me by the President anel 
Fellows of the University of Yale College, by the de- 
gree of Doctor of Laws, my warmest thanks are of- 

stores for the American army. Paul Jones arrived at Philadelphia, on 
the 18lh of February, in command of tlie Ariel, with a car^o of these 
stores from L'Oricnt Congress immediately ordered an inquiry into tlie 
cause of the delay. This duty devolved on tlie Board of Admiralty, who 
proposed forty-seven distinct queries, which Paul Jones answered fully 
and promptly, and to the entire satisfaction of Congress, as to tlie part ho 
had acted in tlie matter. lie sent to Washington a copy of the queries 
and of his answers. The Board reported ; 

" That, ever since Captain Jones first became an officer in the navy of 
these States, he has shown an unremitted attention in planning and exe- 
cuting enterprises calculated to promote the essential interest of our glo- 
rious cause ; that in Europe, altliough in his expedition through the Irish 
channel in the Ranger he did not fully accomplish his purpose, yet he 
made the enemy feel, that it is in the power of a small squadron, under a 
brave and enterprising commander, to retaliate the conflagration of our 
defenceless towns, and took the Drake, a ship in number of guns and 
men superior to the Ranger, which she was sent out to capture ; that, by 
his reputation and address, he obtained the command of a squadron, under 
tlie flag and laws of these States, at tlie expense of our generous allies, 
and tliercwilli captured the Serapis and Scarborough, spreading univer- 
sal alarm llirough the Island of Great Britain and its dependencies ; that, 
in his expedition with that squadron, he made a number of prisoners, 
sufficient to redeem all our fellow-citizens in British dungeons, and es- 
tablished a cartel for their exchange ; that he has made tlie flag of Amer- 
ica respectable among the flags of other nations ; that, returning from 
Europe, he brought willi him the esteem of the greatest and best friend 
of America, and has received from tlie illustrious monarch of France Uiat 
reward of warlike virtue, which his subjects obtain by a long series of 
faitliful ser^'ice3 or uncommon merit 

" The Board are of opinion, that the conduct of Captain John Paul 
Jones merits particular attention, and some distinguishing mark of appro-

TO COLONEL ALEXANDER SCAMMELL. 

New Windsor, 17 May, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I have received intelligence, that a party of the en- 
emy are establishing themselves at or near Fort Lee, 
and building a blockhouse, or some kind of work. If 
they are permitted to complete their plan, it will not on- 
ly be difficult to remove them, but they will harass the 
country from thence, and may be much in the way of 
some future operation. When I formed the battalion, 
which you at present command, it was with a view of 
having a corps ready to execute a project of the kind, 
wiiich I propose to you, and that is, to endeavour to 
strike by surprise the party above mentioned.* You 
will without loss of time see Captain Lawrence, who 
commands the New Yoi'k levies near Dobbs's Ferry, 
and concert measures with him for gaining certain in- 
telligence of the real strength and situation of the en- 
emy ; and, if you find them such as seem to give you a 
tolerable certainty of success, you will plan your attack 
in such manner, as shall be best warranted from your

information. Tlie sooner it is done the better, as the 
enemy, if they are fortifying, will be every clay stronger. 
You will take Captain Lawrence under your command, 
with the levies of .\ew York antl any Jersey militia 
you may fmd embodied ; but you will trust no ollicer 
among them, nor any other but Lawrence, with your 
design. lie is sensible and appe;\rs discreet. 

As I coiiiide very much in your prudence and judg- 
ment, I shall only give you these general directions ; 
namely, to attempt nothing, which may have the ap- 
pearance of rashness, and to guard well against being 
drawn into an ambuscade, or being intercepted by a 
sudden reinforcement from York Island. Captain Law- 
rence's party, who must be acquainted with every foot 
of the grounil, ought to secure you against the former ; 
and guards, at the practicable landing-places, will cer- 
tainly prevent the latter. I shall set out in the morning 
for Connecticut, and shall be absent six or seven days. 
If you make the attempt, I wish you every success. 
I am with great regard, &lc.*

purpose I shall set out hence to-morrow. I am in 
hopes, that we shall be able, from the intelligence re- 
ceived, to settle a definitive plan of the campaign. 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that a pai-t of 
our advanced troops were surprised on Monday morn- 
ing near Croton River, by about sixty horse and two 
hundred foot under the command of Colonel Delancey. 
Colonel Greene, who commanded our party, was mor- 
tally wounded in his quarters. The enemy attempted 
to cai-ry him off, but he died upon the road. Major 
Flagg was killed. The loss of these two officers is to 
be regretted, especially the former, who had upon sev- 
eral occasions distinguished himself, particularly in the 
defence of the post of Red Bank, in 1777, when he 
defeated Count Donop. I enclose a return of our loss 
upon the late occasion.* 

The enemy on their return fell in with Captain Flagg 
of the New Hampshire line, who was patrolling near 
White Plains. They attempted to surround him, and

shire troops, had marched to their assistance. I ordered the Connecticut

TO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

Weathcrsfield, 23 May, 1781. 

Sir, 
The letter, which I have the honor to enclose from 
the Count de Rochambeau, will, I imagine, inform you 
of the intended march of the French army towards the 
North River, and of the destination of the King's 
squadron now in ilie harbour of Newport, if circum- 
stances will admit of the respective movements. I 
should be wanting in respect and confidence, w^ere I 
not to add that our object is New York. The season, 
the difficulty and expense of land transportations, and 
the continual waste of men in every attempt to rein- 
force the southern States, are almost insuperable ob- 
jections to marching another detachment from the army 
on the North River ; nor do I see how it is possible to 
give effectual support to those States, and avert the 
evils which threaten them, while wc arc inferior in na- 
val force in these seas. 

It is not for me to know in what manner the fleet 
of his Most Christian Majesty is to be employed in the 
West Indies this summer, or to inquire at what epoch 
it may be expected on this coast ; but the appearance 
and aid of it in this quarter are of such essential im- 
portance in any offensive operation, and so necessary to 
stop the progress of the enemy's arms at the south- 
ward, that I shall be excused, I am persuaded, for en- 
voi, VIII. 7 E

deavouring to engage your good offices in facilitating an 
event on which so much depends. For this I have a 
stronger plea, when I assure you, that General Ro- 
chambeau's opinion and wishes concur with mine, and 
that it is at his instance principally I make to you this 
address. 

If we are happy enough to find your Excellency in 
sentiment with us, it will be in your power to inform 
the Count de Grasse of the strength and situation of 
the enemy's naval and land force in this country, the 
destination of the French squadron under Admiral Bar- 
ras, and the intentions of the allied arms if a junction 
can be formed. At present the British fleet lies within 
Block Island, and about five leagues from Point Judith. 

The Count de Rochambeau and the Chevalier Chas- 
tellux agree perfectly in sentiment with me, that, while 
affairs remain as they now are, the West India fleet 
should run immediately to Sandy Hook (if there are no 
concerted operadons), where they may be met with all 
the informadon requisite, and where most Ukely it will 
shut in, or cut off. Admiral Arbuthnot, and may be 
joined by the Count de Barras. An early and frequent 
communication from the Count de Grasse would lead to 
preparatory measures on our part, and be a means of 
facilitating the operation in hand, or any other, which 
may be thought more advisable. I know your good- 
ness and your zeal for the common cause too well, to 
offer any thing more as an apology for this liberty ; and 
I persuade myself it is unnecessary for me to declare 
the respect and attachment, with which I have the 
honor to be, &,c.

TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF 
NEW UA.MI'SHIKE. 

Weatlicrefield, 24 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

In consequence of a conference held between the 
Count de Rochambcau and myself at this place, the 
French army will march, as soon as circumstances will 
admit, an.d form a junction with the American army 
upon the North River. The accomplishment of the 
object, which we have in contemplation, is of the ut- 
most importance to America, and will, in all probability 
be attained, unless there should be a failure on our 
part In the number of men, which will be required for 
the operation, or the enemy should withdraw a consid- 
erable part of their force from the southward. It is in 
our own power, by proper exertions, to prevent the for- 
mer; and, should the latter take place, we shall be amply 
repaid our expenses, by liberating the southern States, 
where we have found by experience we are vulnerable. 

Upon the calculations, that I have been able in con- 
cert with some of the most experienced French and 
American officers to form, tlie operation in view will 
require, in addition to the French army, all the Conti- 
nentiil battalions from New Hampshire to New Jersey 
inclusive to be completed to their full establishment. 
You must be sensible, that the measures taken for that 
purpose, in consequence of the last requisition of Con- 
gress, have been very far from answering the end ; as 
few recruits, comparatively speaking, have yet been 
sent forward, and of those, many have been discharged 
on account of their inability. You must also take into 
consiileration, that a number of those men, who were 
returned when the requisition was made, have since 
been taken off by the various casualties incident to an 
army ; I estimate about one sixth of the whole num- 



52 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

ber, and therefore provision must at this time be made 
to replace tliem. 

From what has been premised, you will perceive, 
without my urging further reasons, the necessity I am 
under of calling upon you in the most earnest manner, 
to devise means to send into the field without delay 
the number of men, which has been already voted for 
the completion of the battalions of your State, and the 
further deficiency of one sixth just mentioned. The 
term of three years, or for the war, would undoubtedly 
be preferable to any shorter period ; but if they can- 
not be obtained on those conditions, necessity must 
oblige us to take them for the campaign only, which 
ought to be reckoned to the last day of December. I 
should hope, that, by proper exertions in collecting and 
sending forward the men that have been already raised, 
and compelling by vigorous and decisive methods the 
delinquent towns to furnish their quotas, the greater 
part of the men may be collected by the 1st of July. 

Arguments surely cannot be wanting to impress the 
legislature with a due sense of the obhgation, which 
they are under, of furnishing the means now called for. 
The enemy, counting upon our want of ability, or upon 
our want of energy, have, by repeated detachments to 
the southward, reduced themselves in New York to a 
situation, which invites us to take advantage of it ; and, 
should the lucky moment be lost, it is to be feared 
that they will, after subduing the southern States, raise 
a force in them sufl^cient to hold them, and return 
again to the northward with such a number of men, as 
will render New York secure against any force, which 
we can at this time raise or maintain. Our allies in 
this country expect and depend upon being supported 
by us in the attempt, which we are about to make, and 
those in Europe will be astonished, should we neglect 
the favorable opportunity, which is now offered. 



PartII.] tiik amkrican revolution. 



53 



As it is probahle, that some militia, in addition to (ho 
full complement of Continental troops, may be neces- 
sary to sujiport communications and for otlier purposes, 
you will be pleased to direct four huntlred men to be 
luKl in readiness to m;u'ch within one week after I 
shall call for them, to serve three months after they 
have joined the army. And I would take the liberty 
of requesting, that the executive may be vested with 
full powers, during the recess, to comply with any fur- 
ther requisition I may make foi- men, provisions, or 
the means of transportation, wliicii last may be most 
essential in the course of our operations, should it be- 
come necessary to bring provisions or stores from a 
distance. 

I shall be glad to be favored with an answer as soon 
as possible, with an assurance of what I may depend 
upon ; that, if I do not clearly see a prospect of being 
supported, I may turn my views to a defensive instead 
of an ofl'ensive plan, and save the States and our allies 
the expense, which would be needlessly incurred by 
any but an ample and effectual preparation. 

I have the honor to be, &c.* 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New Windsor, 27 May, 1781. 

Sir, 
I do myself the honor to inform Congress, that I re- 
turned from Weathersfield on the evening of the 25th.t 

• Sent 03 a circular to all the New England States. The number 
of militia requested from Massachusetts was two thousand two hundred, 
and from Connecticut fifteen hundred. As the defence of Newport, after 
the French army should leave it, was to bo entrusted to the militia of 
Rhode Island, no militia were required from that St.ite to join the army 
t Generals Knox and Duportail had accompanied the Commander- 



S-l WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 49. 

I met only tlie Count de Rochambeau at that place, 
accompanied by the Chevalier de Chastellux. The 
British fleet having appeared off Block Island, the 
Count de Barras did not think it prudent to be ab- 
sent. In consequence of the measures concerted at 
the late interview, all the French troops, except about 
two hundred to be left as a guard over their heavy 
stores and baggage at Providence, are to march as 
soon as circumstances will admit, and form a junction 

in-cliief to Weathersfield. The following is an e.xtract from Washing- 
ton's Diary. 

" May ISlh. Set out this day for the interview at Weathersfield with 
the Count de Rochambeau and Admiral Barras. Reached Morgan's 
Tavern, forty-three miles from Fishkill Landing, after dining at Colonel 
Vandeberg's. 

" 19fh. Breakfasted at Litchfield ; dined at Farmington ; and lodged 
at Weatliersfield, at the house of Mr. Josopli Webb. 

"20th. Had a good deal of private conversation witli Governor Trum- 
bull, who gave it to me as his opinion, tliat, if any important offensive 
operation should be undertaken, he had little doubt of our obtaining men 
and provision adequate to our wants. In this opinion Colonel Wads- 
worth and otliers concurred. 

_ "^Ist. Count de Rochambeau, with the Chevalier do Chastellux, ar- 
rived about noon. The appearance of the British fleet, under Admiral 
Arbuthnot, oif Block Island, prevented the attendance of the Count de 
Barras. 

" 22J. Fixed with Count de Rochambeau the plan of the campaign. 

" '2:id. Count de Rochambeau set out on his return to Newport, while 
I prepared and forwarded despatches to the governors of the four New 
England States, calling on them in earnest and pointed terms to com- 
plete their Continental battalions for the campaign at least, if it could 
not be done for tiie war or three years ; to hold a body of militia, ac- 
cording to the proportion given to them, ready to march in one week 
after being called for ; and to adopt some effectual mode to supply the 
troops when assembled with provisions and the means of transportation. 
I also solicited the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut earnestly 
for a loan of powder. 

"24M. Set out on my return to New Windsor. Dined at Farming- 
ton and lodged at Litchfield. 

" 25lh. Breakfasted at Coggswell's ; dined at Colonel Vandeberg's ; 
and arrived at head-quarters about sunset."

with me upon the North River. Five lumdred mili- 
tia are to be stationed upon Rliotic I>laMd lor the pres- 
ervation of the works, whicli have been erected lor 
the security of the harbour. 

Upon a lull consideration of affairs in every point of 
view, an operation against New York has been deemed 
preferable to making further detachments to the south- 
ward, while they can only be sent by land. The prin- 
cipal reasons, which induced to this determination, are, 
the difficulty and expense of transportation, the late- 
ness of the season, which would throw the troops into 
the extremity of the heat of sunmier ; the great waste 
of men, which we have ever experienced in so long a 
march at the healthiest season ; and, above all, a strong 
presumption, that the enemy, weakened as they now 
are by detachments, must cither sacrifice the valuable 
post of New York and its dependencies, or recall a 
part of their force from the southward to defend them. 

The Continental battalions, from New Hampshire to 
New Jersey inclusive, supposing them complete, aided 
by four thousand French troops, and such a reinforce- 
ment of militia as the operation alter its commencement 
may seem to require, have been deemed adequate to 
the attempt upon New York with its present garrison. 
But, as the battalions of those States are still consid- 
erably deficient, I have written in the most pressing 
manner to the respective legislatures, to make up such 
deficiencies with men for the campaign only, if they 
cannot be obtained for a longer term, and have desired 
the governors to hold certain numbers of militia ready 
for service, should 1 have occasion to call for them. I 
am however determined to require no more, than are 
absolutely necessar}.* I shall also call on the State of 



' The luirabcr of militia assigned to New Jersey was five hundred. 



56 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

Pennsylvania to hold sixteen hundred militia in readi- 
ness. 

Congress have been made so fully acquainted with 
the difficulties of every kind, under which the military 
department labors, that they must be sensible nothing 
but the most vigorous exertions on the part of the 
States to supply men, provisions, and the means of 
transportation, can enable me to prosecute to eflect the 
operations, which I have agreed, in conjunction with 
the army of our allies, to undertake, or indeed any 
other. At the dme I made my requisitions upon them, 
I advanced every argument in my power to induce a 
compliance ; but, should I find any hesitation, I shall 
hope for the countenance and support of Congress. 

I am very apprehensive of a formidable invasion of 
the northern frontier, as the enemy from Canada are 
midoubtedly collecting in considerable force at Crown 
Point. Should this be the case, it will cause a very 
unfortunate diversion, and be very embarrassing just at 
this time, when our whole force will be required here. 
The necessity, which I clearly foresee we shall be un- 
der, of taking every man, who can be spared from oth- 
er duties, into the field, induces me to request an or- 
der for such men of the invahd corps at Boston and 
Philadelphia, as are fit for garrison duty, to march to 
West Point, where their services will be the same as 
those upon which they are now employed, and where 
they may be very useful. 

There has been a necessity of abandoning the post 
of Fort Schuyler, and removing the garrison and stores 
to the German Flats. The barracks had been, at the 
beginning of this month, consumed by fire, and the 
works so exceedingly damaged by a heavy storm of 
rain, that they were rendered indefensible ; nor could 
they be repaired in any reasonable time by the number 



PartII] the AMERICAN II K V () L U T I O N. 57 

of men, who coukl he spared as a garrison. Brigadier- 
General Clinton recommended the evacuation of the 
post, as the only alternative, to which I the more read- 
ily consented, as it had been for some time past the 
opinion of the olliccrs best acquainted with that part 
of the country, that a post at the German Flats would 
be more easily sujiported, and equally advantageous to 
the security of the Ironlier. I am, 6cc.

New Windsor, 28 May, 1781, 

Dear Sir, 
As you are perfectly acquainted with the plan, which 
has been concerted with his Excellency Count de Ro- 
chambeau at Weathersfield, I need not enter into a 
detail of particulars. I have only to request, therefore, 
that you will be pleased to make the estimates of the 
articles in your department necessary for the opera- 
tion, and that the previous arrangements for the siege, 
as far as they are within the limits of our ability, may 
be put in the best train, which the circumstances will 
admit. In the mean time, as it has become necessary, 
from the decay of the works, the demolition of the 
barracks, and other circumstances, to abandon the post 
of Fort Schuyler, and erect new fortifications, at or 
near Fort Herkimer, I have to request, that you will 
send an eiigineer to superintend the works in that de- 
partment. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

The late accounts from New York are mysterious

should be in readiness to move. You Mill therefore 
concentre as much as possible your brigade, and put 
them under marching orders. The parties at the Clove 
are not to be immediately called in, but the officers 
commanding them should be warned to be in readi- 
ness. Should an evacuation of New York take place, 
as many strongly suspect, the troops under your com- 
mand will be next in order for detachment. You will 
therefore desire the officers to make preparation for a 
move farther than merely to join the main body of 
the army. As I am very anxious to learn what they 
are really doing in New York, you will oblige me by 
obtaining and sending me as accurate intelligence as 
possible. I am, &c. 



TO JOHN SULLIVAN, IN CONGRESS. 

New Windsor, 29 May, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

No arguments were necessary to convince me of the 
very great public utility, which would result from the 
success of the plan you proposed laying before Con- 
gress. Had I been unapprized of the advantages, 
wdiich might be derived to our cause from a successful 
attempt, or even a powerful diversion in that quarter, 
the reasons you have offered would have carried irre- 
fragable demonstration with them, and induced me to 
be of your opinion. But the distressed and embarrass- 



PahtII.] TIIK AMERICAN revolution. 59 

ed state of our affairs, on account of supplies, with 
which you are well acciuiunted, the languiil ellbrts of the 
States to procure men, and the insuperable ditliculties 
in the way of transportation, would, I apprehend, have 
rendered the scheme abortive in the first instance. 
And I must inform you, that there is yet another ob- 
stacle, which makes the attempt you have suggested 
absolutely impracticable by the means you propose, but 
which I am not at Uberty to commit to paper for fear 
of the same misfortune, which has already happened 
to some of my letters. 

You will have seen before the receipt of this, l)y my 
public letter to Congress of the 27th instant, the re- 
sult of the deliberations of the Count de Rochambeau 
and myself at Wcatherstield. That plan, upon the ma- 
turest consideration, and after combining all the present 
circumstances and future prospects, appeared, though 
precarious, far the most eligible of any we could pos- 
sibly devise, whilst we are inferior at sea. The ob- 
ject was considered to be of greater magnitude, and 
more within our reach, than any other. The weakness 
of the garrison at New York, the central position for 
drawing together men and supplies, and the spur, which 
an attempt against that place, would give to every ex- 
ertion, were among the reasons, which prompted to that 
undertaking, and promised the fairest prospect of suc- 
cess, unless the enemy should recall a considerable part 
of their force from the southward. And even in this 
case, the same measure, which might produce disap- 
pointment in one quarter, would certainly in the event 
afford the greatest relief in another. While an oppor- 
tunity presents itself of striking the enemy a fatal blow, 
I will persuade myself, that the concurring exertions of 
Congress, of the several States immediately concerned, 
and of every individual in them, who is well affected 



60 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 



to our cause, will be united in yielding every possible 
aid. At this crisis, while I rejoice at the appointment 
of the minister of finance, I have sincerely to regret, 
that the ministers of the other departments have not 
also been appointed, especially a minister of war. At 
the same time I am happy to learn, that the mode of 
promotion is on the point of being finally established. 
With the highest sentiments of regard, I am, &c.* 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

New Windsor, 31 May, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

Your conduct upon every occasion meets my appro- 
bation, but in none more than in your refusing to hold a 

* This letter was intercepted by the enemy, sent to the British minis- 
try, and published in the London Gazette on the 14th of July. Otliers 
of a similar tenor were also intercepted, and Sir Henry Clinton seems to 
have considered them as written for that purpose, and designedly put in 
the way of being taken. It has been said, that he believed they were 
meant to deceive, and that Washington's plans were actually the reverse 
of those mentioned in the letters. British historians have adopted this 
idea, and commended it as an evidence of well-timed address on the part 
of the American general. {Anmial Register for 1781, p. 12.3. — An- 
DKEws's History of the Late War, Vol. IV. p. 198.) It is certain, how- 
ever, that no such deception was intended, and that the letters expressed 
the real designs of the Commander-in-chief. The first impressions of 
Sir Henry Clinton on the subject were confirmed, by a confidential letter 
from the Marquis de Chastellu.\ to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, inter- 
cepted nearly at the same time, in wliich the writer stated that a com- 
bined attack on New York had been determined upon, and took to him- 
self much credit for bringing over Count de Rochambeau to General 
Washington's opinion. The letter also contained free remarks on the 
deportment of tlie French commander, and the reserve in which he held 
himself as to consulting with his subordinate oflicers. A copy of this 
letter was carefully transmitted from New York to Count de Rocham- 
beau, it being doubtless deemed well suited to breed strife in the French 
camp. It had not this efiect, but it was received with displeasure by 
Count de Rochambeau. " I sent for the Marquis de Chastellux," said 
he ; " I showed him the letter ; I then threw it into the fire, and left liim 
a prey to his own reflections." — Mimoirea de Rochambeau, Tom. I. p. 274.

him to inform you, as I did not know at that time 
where you might be, that I had good reason to believe 
a detachment of between fifteen hundred and two 
thousand men had saiKil from New York a few days 
before. I now have it confirmed, and I think you may 
either look for them in the Chesapeake or further soulh- 
wai"d. 

Your determination to avoid an engagement, with 
your present force, is certainly judicious. I hope the 
Pennsylvanians have begun their march before this 
time, but I have no information of it. General Wayne 
has been pressed, both by Congress and the Board 
of War, to make as much expedition as possible, and 
extraordinary powers are given to enable him to pro- 
cure provisions. I am, with very sincere regard, &,c.t 

• After the death of General Phillips (May 13), the command of the 
British army in Virginia devolved on Arnold. He sent an officer to La- 
fayette with a Rag and a letter. As soon as Lafayette saw the name at 
the bottom of the letter he refused to read it, and told the officer, that he 
would hold no intercourse whatever with Arnold ; but with any otlier of- 
ficer he should be ever ready to reciprocate the civilities, which the cir- 
cumstances of the two armies might render desirable.

another letter to Lafayette of the same date, containing the substance 
of the interi'iew with Count dc Rochambcau at Weathersfield, and the 
proposed plan of the campaign.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

New Windsor, 1 June, 1781. 

My dear Sir, 

The difficulties, which you daily encounter and sur- 
mount with your small force, add not a little to your 
reputation ; and I am pretty well assured, that, should 
you be obliged finally to withdraw fi'om South Carolina 
and even from North Carolina, it will not be attributed 
to your want either of abilities or of exertion, but to 
the true cause, the want of means to support the war 
in them. I feel for your mortification at the loss of the 
day before Camden, after it seemed so much in your 
favor; but I hope you will have found, that the enemy 
suffered severely, as in their publication of the affair in 
New York they confess the loss of two hundred. The 
reduction of Fort Watson does honor to General Ma- 
rion and Colonel Lee. 

I liave lately had an interview with Count de Ro- 
chambeau at Weathersfield. Our affairs were very at- 
tentively considered in every point of view, and it was 
finally determined to make an attempt upon New York 
with its present garrison, in preference to a southern 
operation, as we had not the decided command of the 
water. You will readily suppose the reasons, which 
induced this determination, were the inevitable loss of 
men from so long a march, more especially in the ap- 
proaching hot season, and the ditiiculty, I may say im- 
possibility, of transporting the necessary baggage, ar- 
tillery, and stores by land. If I am supported as I 
ought to be by the neighbouring States in this opera- 
tion, which you know has always been their favorite 
one, I hope that one of these consequences will follow, 
either that the enemy will be expelled from the most 
valuable position which they hold upon the continent,

or he oliligcd to recall part of their force from tlic 
southward to defeiul it. Should the latter happen, you 
will be most essentially relieved by it. The French 
troops will begin their march this way as soon as cer- 
tain circumstances will admit. I can only give you the 
outlines of our plan. The dangers, to which letters are 
exposed, make it improper to commit to paper the 
particulars ; but as matters ripen I will keep you as 
well informed as circumstances will allow. 

A detachment of between fifteen hundred and two 
thousand men sailed from l^cw York about the 13th of 
May. I advised Baron Steuben of this, and desired 
him to communicate it to you. I presume they will 
either stop in the Chesapeake Bay or Cape Fear River, 
unless the operations of the Spaniards in the Floridas 
should call for reinforcement to that quarter. But I 
can hardly flatter myself, that they will attend to the 
preservation of St. Augustine. We are told that Pen- 
sacola has fallen. 

The Marquis de Lafayette informed me, that about 
eight hundred recruits would be ready to march from 
Virginia by the latter end of May. I have no certain 
accounts from Maryland lately ; but I was told by a 
gentleman from thence, that about four hundred might 
be expected to march in April. • I make no doubt but 
you are kept regularly advised l)y the superintending 
ofliccrs. I have not heard, that General Wayne had 
left Yorktown, but I have reason to believe he has 
gone before this time. If no fresh discontents arise 
among those troops, the detachment with Wayne will 
be a most valuable acquisition to you. They are chiefly 
the old soldiers, and completely furnished with every 
necessary. I am, &,c.*

the 20th of Mav.

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

New Windsor, 4 June, 1781. 

Sir, 
I had last evening the honor of receiving your favor 
of the 31st of IMay by the Duke de Lauzun, who in- 
forms me, that he is authorized by your Excellency 
and Count de Barras to enter into a free communica- 
tion with me upon the subject of the council of war 
held on board the Due de Bourgogne, and request my 
opinion upon the propriety of their determination.* 

* Intelligence had been brought to Count de Rochambeau by his son 
and Count de Barras, that a strong armament had departed from Brest, or 
would immediately depart, under Count de Grasse, for the West Indies ; 
and that, after he had passed the Azores, Count de Grasse would detach 
a convoy with somewhat more than six hundred recruits, escorted by the 
armed vessel Sagittaire, and destined to unite with the French army at 
Newport. Money for the army and navy was also to be brought by the 
Sagittaire. The news was likewise entrusted to Count de Rochambeau 
alone, that Count de Grasse had orders to sail with his fleet to the coast 
of the United States in the month of July or August, to relieve the 
squadron of M. de Barras ; and in case M. de Rochambeau should march 
from Newport to unite with General Washington before the arrival of 
Count de Grasse'e fleet, then the squadron of Barras was to retire to the 
harbour of Boston for security, as it was supposed, that, without the pro- 
tection of the French army on shore, the vessels would be in danger of 
a naval attack from the enemy with a superior force. — Memohes de Ro- 
cliambraii, Tom. I. p. 270. 

It having been decided at the conference between the American and 
Frencli commanders, held at Weathersfield, that the French army should 
leave Newport and march to the North River, tiie manner of disposing 
of the French fleet was taken into consideration immediately after the 
return of Count de Rochambeau. The result is explained in the follow- 
ing extract from a letter written by him to General Washington. 

" The Count de Barras, instead of going to Boston according to his 
orders, has held a council of war, the result of which I send here en- 
closed. I hope your Excellency will as soon as possible send an order, 
that the militia, who are to be stationed on this Island, be raised to tlie 
number of one thousand. They will be joined by four hundred men, 
whom I shall leave under the orders of M. de Choisy, a brigadier-general, 
and a very good ofiicer. I think tliat the State of Massachusetts may 
furnish the five hundred men, that have been demanded by tiie council 



I'MM 111 ''III' AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 05 

I must confess to your Excellency, that there is 
weight in the reasons, which are uU'ered lor the deten- 
tion of his Majesty's licet in the harbour of Newport, 
in preference to its going round to Jioston ; but as 1 
cannot think, that it will be as safe in all possible cases 
in the harbour of Newport, after the gi-eater pai-t of the 
French army has been withdrawn, as it would be in 
the harbour of Boston, I must adhere to my opinion, 
and to the plan fixed at Weathersfield, as most eligi- 
ble, all circumstances considered. I would not, how- 
ever, set up my single judgment against that of so 
many gentlemen of experience, more especially as the 
matter partly depends upon a knowledge of marine 
alHiirs, of which I candidly confess my ignorance. I 
would, then-fore, in order to avoid delay, rest the mat- 
ter upon the following footing. If your Excellency, the 
Count de Barras, and the other gentlemen should, up- 
on further consideration of the subject, aided by any 
new information, which you may have received, still 
think it most advisable to adhere to the former resolu- 
tion of the council, you may make use of the enclosed 
letters to the governors of Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island, which are left open for your inspection. If, on 

of war for the surety of the squadron, and that it is suitable that your 
Excellency should send to M. do Choisy an order to convene a greater 
number in case of need, and letters for tlie governors of the States of 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 

" It is useless to say to your E.xcellency, that one of the chief rea- 
sons, that decided the council of war to keep tlie squadron at Rhode 
Island, was the fear lest America should look upon this change from New- 
port to Boston as a retreat The desire to be nearer for our future 
operations, when the superior naval force expected in tlie course of the 
summer shall arrive in these seas, has been another reason. Your Ex- 
cellency knows that the harbour of Boston is very unfavorable at this 
season, on account of the south-west winds, lliat blow almost continually. 
The junction of M. de Barras with the forces that mijlit come, would 
perhaps be delayed for a month, and consequently all the operations de- 
pending on it," — MS. Letter, JVewport, May 3lst.

the contrary, you should change your opinions, the let- 
ters may be destroyed, as that Avhich was written by 
me to the governor of Rhode Island from Weathers- 
field will be sufficient for the purpose of calling out five 
hundred militia for the present, and such further num- 
bers as exigencies may require. 

At any rate, I could wish that the march of the 
troops might now be hurried as much as possible. 
The strides, which the enemy are making at the south- 
ward, demand a collection of our force in this quarter, 
that we may endeavour to commence our operation. 
I know of no measure, which will be so likely to af- 
ford rehef to the southern States, in so short a time, 
as a serious menace against New York. This your 
Excellency may remember was a principal inducement 
for our undertaking that operation, in preference to the 
other, which was spoken of; and I assure you the calls 
upon me from the southward are so pressing, that 
nothing but seeing our preparations agmnst New York 
m some degree of forwardness will content them, or 
convmce them that they are Ukely to derive any advan- 
tages from the force, which they see detained here. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAMES CLINTON.

• In a private letter Mr. Morris liad cominuniciited to General Wash- 
ington notice, that he had accepted the appointment of Siipcrinlcnrlcnl of

" .\ conunittce of Congress having communicated to me the distress 
of your army for want of bread, and shown me a motion that had been 
made in Congress in consequence thereof, but which was committed in 
order to a conference with me on the subject, I found myself immediate- 
ly impressed with the strongest desire to afford you relief. Not being 
prepared in my official character with funds or means of accomplishing 
the supplies you need, I have written to General Schuyler and to Air. 
Thomas Lowrey in New Jersey, requesting their immediate exertions to 
procure upon tlieir own credit one thousand barrels of flour each, and 
send the same forward in parcels as fast as procured to camp, deliver- 
able to your Excellency's order ; and I have pledged myself to pay them 
in hard money for the cost and charges, within a month, six weeks, or 
two months. I shall make it a point to procure the money, being de- 
termined never to make an engagement that cannot be fnltilled; for if 
by any means I should fail in this respect, I will quit my office as use-

companies of Van Schaick's regiment have since sailed.* 
Hazen's will follow to-morrow. I have now to com- 
municate my sentiments in general, respecting the dis- 
position and application of this force. 

It is clearly my opinion, that the reinforcements lately 
ordered to the northward should be kept together as 
much as circumstances will admit, or at least so near 
as to be speedily assembled upon an emergency ; as 
it is not certain or probable, that they will be con- 
tinued permanently in that quarter, and as they are 
designed while there to strike the enemy, should they 
be so presumptuous as to attempt to penetrate into 
the country. It also appears to me, that the force on 
the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers ought not to be so 
widely scattered as formerly, but stationed in as com- 
pact a manner as may be, except such light parties 
as occasion may require to be kept out. By distrib- 
uting the troops, with a view of protecting every inch 
of ground, the efficient force is dissipated and lost, 
and the several posts are so weakened as to invite 
the enemy to enterprise. I wish you therefore to con- 
centre your strength as much as possible at the points 
you may judge most expedient, to form a plan of de- 
fence for the frontier, and to transmit to me the re- 
sult of your determination. I am, dear Sir, &c.t 



* In the letter of the 28th he liad promised the six companies of Van 
Schaick's regiment. 

t In another letter, dated the 16th of June, the above orders were in 
part countermanded, so far as to direct General Clinton to keep these 
forces more compact than the first orders might imply, since it was prob- 
able that they might be withdrawn, at a short notice, to act witli the 
main army in the expected operations against New York.

TO Tin: l'l!i;SIUKNT OF CONGRKSS. 

New Windsor, Juno, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have written to the Board of War, on the subject 
of the removal of the convention troops, and have given 
it as my opinion, witii my reasons, that they had best 
for the present be hahed in Pennsylvania. An ex- 
change of those troops, on proper terms, would cer- 
tainly be a desirable thing ; but under present circum- 
stances I do not think it would be advisable to give the 
enemy any reinforcement of privates. Every man they 
get adds immediately to their force. Many of those, 
whom we obtain in exchange, are out of then- term of 
service, and consequently lost to us. 

It is as much my wish, as it can be your Excellen- 
cy's, that General Gates's affair should be brought to 
a decision. You must be convinced, that nothing has 
been left undone by me to effect that purpose. Gen- 
eral Gates informs me, that he cannot think of serving, 
until the matter shall have been properly investigated, 
and that he shall retire in the mean time to Virginia. 
I see no probal)ility of any thing further being done 
until there shall be some recess in southern operations. 

I hope the rules of promotion, which Congress have 
been pleased to establish, will be generally satisfactory. 
Individuals may be affected by the change of mode, 
but it will be impossible to devise a plan, which will 
not interfere in some degree with particulai- interests. 
I send your Excellency by this conveyance duplicates 
of my letters, the originals of which were taken in the 
last week's mail. The communication by the post from 
hence to Philadelphia has become so dangerous, that I 
cannot in future trust any despatches of importance by 
him, and I beg you will observe the same rule. The

be expected, and cannot fail of securing him. They 
have not the same opportunity of intercepting expres- 
ses, as their times of riding are uncertain.

TO JOHN MATHEWS, IN CONGRESS. 

New Windsor, 7 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

The freedom of your communications is highly pleas- 
ing to me. The portrait you have drawn of our af- 
fairs is strictly agreeable to the life, and you do me 
but justice m supposing, that my mind is fortified 
against, or rather prepared for, the most distressing 
accounts that can be given of them. It would not be 
the part of friendship, therefore, to conceal any cir- 
cumstance, from an unwillingness to give pain, especial- 
ly as the knowledge of it, to a man determined not 
to smk under the weight of perplexities, may be of 
the utmost importance. But we must not despair ; the 
game is yet in our own hands ; to play it well is all 
we have to do, and I trust the experience of error 
will enable us to act better in future. A cloud may 
yet pass over us, individuals may be ruined, and the 
country at large, or particular States, undergo tempo- 
rary distress ; but certain I am, that it is in our power 
to bring the war to a happy conclusion. 

My public letters to Congress, and in a more es- 
pecial manner my private communications to Governor 
Rudedge, will bring you fully acquainted with the sit- 
uation of things in this quarter, and the prospects be- 
fore us. How far we shall be able to extricate our- 
selves from the former, and reaUze the latter, time

only can show. I liave great expectations from tlie 
appointment of Mr. Morris, but tliey are not unreason- 
able ones; for I di) not suppose, tiiat by any magic 
art he can ilo more iluui recover us by degrees from 
the labyrintii into wliic li our fmances are plunged. 

I am very sorry for llie liisagreeablc situation of our 
sulfering soldiery at Charleston, and wish they could 
be relieved without adiling to the pressure under which 
we at present groan. How far it is in General Greene's 
power to liberate, by exchange, our prisoners in that 
quarter I know not ; but he has all the autliority I can 
give to do this, reserving the troops of convention from 
his disposal. With tlusc I have trouble enough. In 
a late interview between the two commissaries of pris- 
oners, Mr. Loring refused to exchange Genend Bur- 
goyne, unless the prisoners taken at the Cedars are 
allowed for, which is opposed by a resolve of Con- 
gress ; and he has actually refused to pay a debt of 
privates, which three months ago he promised to do. 
I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

New Windsor, 8 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
The progress, which the enemy are making in Vir- 
ginia, is very alarming, not only to the State imme- 
diately invaded, but to all the rest ; for I strongly sus- 
pect, from the most recent European intelligence, that 
the enemy are endeavouring to make as large seeming 
conquests as possible, that they may urge the plea of 
uti possidetis in the proposed mediation.* Your Ex- 

* The Empress of Russia and the Emperor of Austria liad proposed

cellency will be able to judge of the probability of this 
conjecture from the circular letter of the President of 
Congress.* 

Were it prudent to commit a detail of our plans and 
expectations to paper, I could convince you by a va- 
riety of reasons, that my presence is essential to the 
operations, which have lately been concerted between 
the French commanders and myself, and which are to 
open in this quarter, provided the British keep posses- 
sion of New York. There have lately been rumors of 
an evacuation of that place, but I do not put confi- 
dence in them. Should I be supported by the neigh- 
bouring States in the manner which I expect, the en- 
emy will, I hope, be reduced to the necessity of recalling 
part of their force from the southward to support New 
York, or they will run the most imminent risk of be- 
ing expelled, with great loss of stores, from that post, 
which is to them invaluable while they think of pros- 
ecuting the war in America ; and should we, by a lucky 
coincidence of circumstances, gain a naval superiority, 
their ruin would be inevitable. The prospect of giving 
relief to the southern States, by an operation in this 
quarter, was the principal inducement for undertaking 
it. Indeed we found, upon a full consideration of our 
afl'airs in every point of view, that, without the com- 
mand of the water, it would be next to impossible for 
us to transport the artillery, baggage, and stores of the 
army to so great a distance ; and, besides, we should 
lose at least one third of our force by desertion, sick- 
ness, and the heats of the approaching season, even 
if it could be done. 

Your Excellency may probably ask whether we are 

to act as mediators for a general peace. See Diplomatic Correspond- 
ence of the .American Revolution, Vol. XI. p. 33.

to remain here for the above reasons, should the en- 
emy evacuate New York, and transfer the whole wtu- 
to the soutliwai-d. To tliis 1 answer without hesitation, 
that we must in such case follow tluiu at every ex- 
pense, and under every dilliculty and loss ; but that, 
while we remain inferior at sea, and there is a proba- 
bility of giving relief by diversion, and that perhaps 
sooner than by seniling reinforcements immediately to 
the point in distress, policy dictates the trial of the 
former. 

Allow me, before I take leave of your Excellency in 
your public capacity, to express the obligations I am 
under for the readiness and zeal with which you have 
always forwarded and supported every measure, which 
I have had occasion to recommend through you, and to 
assure you, that I shall esteem myself honored by a 
continuation of your friendship and correspondence, 
should your country permit you to remain in the pri- 
vate walk of life. I have the honor to be, &,c.* 

• It was the strong desire of the people of Virginia, that Washington 
would take command of the army in that State. In the letter, to which 
the above was a reply, Mr. Jefferson had written ; — 

" We are too far removed from the other scenes of war to say whether 
the main force of the enemy be within tliis State ; but I suppose they 
cannot anywhere spare so great an army for the operations of the field. 
Were it possible for this circumstance to justify in your Excellency a 
determination to lend us your personal aid, it is evident from the uni- 
versal voice, that the presence of their beloved countryman, whose tal- 
ents have been so long successfully employed in establishing the freedom 
of kindred States, to whose person they have still flattered tlicmselves 
they retained some right, and have ever looked up as their dernier resort 
in distress, that your appearance among them, I say, would restore full 
confidence of salvation, and would render them equal to whatever is not 
impossible. I cannot undertake to foresee and obviate the difficulties, 
which stand in the way of such a resolution. The whole subject is be- 
fore you, of which I see only detached parts, and your judgment will be 
formed in view of the whole. Should tlie danger of this State, and its 
consequence to the Union, be such as to render it best for the whole,

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

New Windsor, 13 June, 1781. 

Sir, 

I am honored by your Excellency's favors of the 
9th and 10th instant, and with their very interesting 
communications, which you may be assured will be 
kept perfectly secret. I flatter myself, that the whole 
convoy will arrive in safety in some of the eastern 
ports, as I beheve the British ships are all cruising off 
the Hook.* 

The Count de Barras has furnished me with the re- 

that you should repair to its assistance, the difficulty would tlien be how 
to keep men out of the field. 

"I have undertaken to hint this matter to your Excellency, not only 
on my own sense of its importance to us, but at the solicitations of 
many members of weight in our legislature, not yet assembled to speak 
their own desires. A few days will bring to me that period of relief, 
which the constitution has prepared for those oppressed with the labors 
of my office ; and a long declared resolution of relinquishing it to abler 
hands has prepared my way for retirement to a private station. Still, 
however, as an individual citizen I should feel the comfortable effects of 
your presence, and have (what I thought could not have been) an addi- 
tional motive for that gratitude, esteem, and respect, with which I have 
the honor to be, &c." — Charlottesville, May QSth. 

In writing to Mr. Jones, a delegate in Congress from Virginia, on the 
same subject, Wasliington said; — "Nobody, I persuade myself, can 
doubt my inclination to be immediately employed in the defence of that 
country where all my property and connexions are, but there are power- 
ful objections to my leaving this armjf. Neither time nor prudence will 
allow me to go into a detail of them on paper. One only I will name, 
which is, that no other person lias power to command the French troops, 
who are now about to form a junction witli this army. Let it suffice for 
me to add, that I am acting on a great scale ; that temporary evils must 
be endured, where there is no remedy at hand ; that I am not witbout 
hopes that the tables may be turned ; but, these being contingent, I can 
promise no more than my utmost exertions." — June 7th. 

* This was the convoy of French vessels with recruits sent by Count 
de Grasse, under the escort of a fifty-gun ship, as mentioned in a note 
to the letter above, dated June 4th. Two tliirds of the convoy and the 
ship had arrived at Boston ; the other third had been dispersed in a gale 
near tlie coast.

suit of the second council of wm: I have so high a 
respect for the opinions of the gentlemen, who com- 
posed it, that I shouKl have been satisfied had they 
barely mentioned their adherence to their former de- 
termination ; but the new arguments, which have been 
introduced in fii\or of the detention of the fleet at 
Rhode Island, leave me no room to doubt llie pro- 
priety of the measure. 

I am so fully convinced, that your I'^xcellency will 
make no unnecessary delay in your march, that I have 
only occasion to repeat my former request, that it may 
be commenced as soon as circumstances will admit. 
My last accounts from the Marquis de Lafayette were 
of the 3d of June. The Bridsh army, in very consid- 
erable force, were then between Richmond and Fred- 
ericksburg ; their destination was uncertain ; but from 
theh' superiority they were at full liberty to go wher- 
ever they pleased. The enclosed copy of a letter from 
the President of Congress to me will give the latest 
intelligence from South Carolina. 

Your requisitions to the Count de Grasse extend to 
every thing I could wish. You cannot, in my opinion, 
too strongly urge the necessity of his bringing a body of 
troops with him, more especially as I am very doubtful, 
whether our force can be drawn together by the time 
he proposes to be here. Now four thousand or five 
thousand men, in addition to what we shall certainly 
have by that time, would, almost beyond a doubt, ena- 
ble us with the assistance of the fleet to carry our ob- 
ject. It is to be regretted, that the Count's stay upon 
the coast will be limited. That consideration is an ad-

76 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

Your Excellency will recollect, that New York was 
looked upon by us as the only practicable object under 
present circumstances ; but should we be able to secure 
a naval superiority, we may perhaps find others more 
practicable and equally advisable. If the frigate should 
not have sailed, I wish you to explain this matter to 
the Count de Grasse ; for, as I understand it, you have 
in your communication to him confined our views to 
New York alone. And, instead of advising him to run 
immediately into the Chesapeake, will it not be best to 
leave him to judge, from the information he may from 

during some part of the campaign. Count de Grasse wrote as follows to 
Count de Rochambeau. 

" His Majesty has entrusted me with the command of tlie naval force 
destined for tlie protection of his possessions in South America, and those 
of his allies in Nortli America. The force, which I command, is suf- 
ficient to fulfil the offensive plans, which it is the interest of the allied 
powers to execute, that they may secure an honorable peace. If the 
men-of-war are necessary for fulfilling the projects, which you have in 
view, it will be useful to the service, that M. de Barras or M. Destouches 
be apprized of it, and that pilots be sent to us skilful and well instructed, 
as the French sliips have a larger draft of water tlian the British. It 
will not be till the 15tli of July, at the soonest, tliat I shall be on the 
coast of North America ; but it will be necessary, by reason of the short 
time that I have to stay in that country (also being obliged to leave it 
on account of the season), that every thing necessary for the success of 
your projects should be in readiness, that not a moment for action may 
be lost." — .«.?. Letter, dated at Sea, March 2i)th. 

The above letter was sent by tlie convoy. Count de Rochambeau de- 
spatched a vessel immediately for the West Indies, with full intelligence 
to Count de Grasse concerning the plans in view, and also the strength, 
situation, and apparent designs of the enemy. He recommended to him 
to enter the Chesapeake on his way, as there might be an opportunity 
of striking an important stroke there, and then to proceed immediately 
to New York, and be ready to cooperate with the allied armies in an 
attack upon that city. Ho likewise requested, that, if possible, five or 
six thousand land troops miglit be brought from the West Indies. 

He writes thus to General Washington; but in his Mimoircs he takes 
somewhat more credit to himself respecting the proposed operation in 
the Chesapeake. 

" I presented to M. de Grasse," says he, " a picture of the distresses 
of the southern States, and above all of Virginia, which had nothing to

time to time receive of the situation of the enemy's 
lleet upon tliis coast, which will be the most advan- 
tageous quarter for him to make his appearance in ? 
In the letter, which was written to the minister from 
Weathersfield, in which he was requested to urge the 
Count to come this way with his whole fleet, Sandy 
Hook was mentioned as the most desirable point ; be- 
cause, by coming suddenly there, he would certainly 
block up any fleet, which might be within; and he 
would even have a very good chance of foi-cing the 
entrance, before dispositions could be made to oppose 
him. Should the British fleet not be there, he could 
follow (111 III In I he Chesapeake, which is always ac- 
cessible to a superior force. I am, &,c. 

oppose tlie inroads of Lord Cornwallis but a small body of troops under 
Lafayette, who was sustained only by his good conduct and tlic nature 
of tlie country intersected by many rivers. I transmitted to M. dc Grasse 
the articles of tlie conference at Weatiiorsficld. I observed to him, that 
he ought to know better than myself the possibility of forcing a passage 
into the harbour of New York, since, in circumstances nearly similar, 
M. d'Estaing, under whose orders he had served, had made an ineffectual 
proposal to tlie pilots, in offering them an enormous sum to take his ves- 
sels across the bar, which they did not venture to attempt. In short, I 
represented to him, as ray private opinion, tliat an enterprise in the Ches- 
apeake Bay against Lord Cornwallis would be the most practicable, and 
the least expected by the enemy, who counted on our distance from that 
quarter. I requested him to solicit strenuously from tlic governor of St 
Domingo the use for three montlis of the French brigade under M. de 
St Simon, wliich was destined to act witli the Spaniards, who, it appeared 
to me, would have no employment for it during the campaign. I desired 
him, also, to effect a loan in our colonies of twelve hundred thousand 
francs, which might insure the success of this operation. I concluded by 
entreating him to despatch to me a frigate as soon as possible, with his 
answer, tliat I might arrange with General Washington our march by 
land to join him at the point assigned in the Chesapeake." — Mimoires, 
Tom. II. p. 277. 

These schemes of Count de Rochambeau do not appear in his letters 
to General Washington. There are several indications, that he did not 
approve an attack upon New York, and only yielded his assent to what 
he discovered to be the wish of the American commander.

TO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

New Windsor, 13 June, 1781. 

Sir, 

Having been made acquainted by the Count de Ro- 
chambeau, with the design of the Count de Grasse to 
come to this coast with his fleet, I cannot forbear ex- 
pressing my ardent wishes, that a body of land forces 
might also attend this naval armament ; for I am ap- 
prehensive, that such a decided superiority of men may 
not be drawn together by the time Count de Grasse 
will be here, as to insure our success against the en- 
emy's most important posts. His continuance in these 
seas may also be limited to a short period ; and the 
addition of a respectable corps of troops from the West 
Indies would, in all human probability, terminate the 
matter very soon in our favor. 

If these should likewise be your sentiments, and if 
this plan should not interfere with the intentions and 
interest of his Most Christian Majesty elsewhere, I en- 
treat your Excellency, by the first good conveyance, to 
represent the propriety and necessity of the measure 
to the commanders in the West Indies ; that by one 
great and decisive stroke the enemy may be expelled 
from the continent, and the independence of America 
established at the approaching negotiation. 

I have the honor to be, &c.* 

* Four days after the above was written, General Washington sug- 
gested in a letter to Count de Rochambeau. that an important expedi- 
tion to the Chesapeake might be undertaken by M. de Barras with his 
fleet, as it was not wanted at Newport. If such a squadron, as he could 
command, were in the Chesapeake, it would prevent a reunion of the 
enemy's forces, and, by shutting out supplies by water, those in Vir- 
ginia would soon be reduced to great difficulties. Count de Barras ex- 
pressed himself favorably inclined to the measure, but said he could not 
be ready to sail under twenty days, and hinted at obstacles, which seem 
never to have been removed.

TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

New Wimlsor, 21 June, 1781. 

Dear Siis, 

I have just received a letter from Brigadier-General 
Clinton, enclosing the examination of two prisoners 
who were taken lately by one of his scouts ; from 
whence it appears the enemy in Canada have not 
made any movements in force, or preparations for an 
incursion ; and indeed this intelligence corresponds so 
exactly with that which has been received through 
other channels, that I cannot but regret having sent 
the reinforcement to the northward, at a time when 
the aid of every man was so essential to the success 
of the operations in contemplation. 

As it will be indispensably necessary, when we ad- 
vance towards the enemy's lines, to withdraw the regu- 
lar force from the northward, I have thought proper to 
advise General Clinton and your Excellency of it, that 
provision might be made as far as practicable to re- 
place these troops witli the men engaged for the cam- 
paign and the three years' service. At the same time 
that I express my unhappiness at being forced to the 
measure, and assure your Excellency, that nothing but 
necessity could induce me to recall the Continental 
troops, I wish it may be understood, that, when the mo- 
ment of operating arrives, there is not any considera- 
tion which can persuade me to counteract the plan, that 
has been concerted between the Count de Rochambeau 
and myself. But lest the enemy should attempt to 
take advantage of their absence, to make inroads on 
the frontier, in order to distract our attention and cause 
a diversion in favor of their most important post, I beg 
leave to recommend in the strongest terms, that every 
means in your power should be made use of to guard 
against such an event. 



80 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 49. 

I will also take the liberty to suggest, whether an 
additional security might not be afforded to those posts, 
which are exposed to the ravages of the enemy, by 
my sending a Continental officer to assist in rousing 
and assembling the force of the country, and to put 
himself at the head of such militia and volunteers, as 
might be drawn together on an emergency from the 
district of country called Vermont ; and whether, in that 
case, Brigadier-General Stark would not be a proper 
character to employ on this service, especially as he 
has already obtained a reputation from his successes 
in that quarter, and is undoubtedly a man of bravery, 
and has been accustomed to command irregular troops 
in action. It appears to me, that a popular officer in 
that situation would be extremely advantageous on 
many accounts. Whether there may be reasons of 
state against it, I know not. I have, therefore, sub- 
mitted it to your consideration. I beg your opinion 
freely on the subject, and have the honor to be with 
great respect, &c. 



TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

New Windsor, 23 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I can easily conceive the disappointment and mor- 
tification you have suffered, upon finding the flattering 
prospects of fiUing your line so unexpectedly blasted, 
by the anxious sensations I have experienced on the 
same subject. If what has been so often urged and 
repeated will not excite the States to the most strenu- 
ous exertions, in completing the Continental battalions, 
I almost despair of success from any thing I can add to 
my former representations, arguments, and entreaties.

This however should not relax our unremitting endeav- 
ours to serve our country to the extent of our abilities 
in every possible way. 

The desire you express for active service is very 
commendable. I beg you will be persuaded, that I 
have not the least inclination to restrain so laudable a 
passion. You will therefore be at liberty to attempt 
to rouse the spirit of the country, and put yourself at 
the head of the cavalry, in the manner you propose. 
I sincerely 'wish your efforts may be crowned with 
success. If the State has not already appointed a 
general officer to command the State troops, destined 
for the southern service, I could wish these troops 
might also be put under yom- orders. Possibly it 
might be well to present an oHer of your services, and 
to intimate that you have my consent to accept this 
command, if the State should think proper to confer 
it upon you. I am, &,c.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL STARK. 

New Windsor, 25 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Upon finding it necessary, for the operations of the 
campaign, to recall the Continental troops from the 
northward, I have ordered six hundred militia from the 
counties of Berkshire and Hampshire to that quarter, 
m addition to the militia and State troops of New 
York ; and I have now to request that you will take the 
general command of all the troops in that department, 

* One half of Count de Rochambeau's army embarked on the 10th of 
June for Providence. The other half followed soon afterwards. They 
proceeded from Providence by way of Windham to Hartford. The 
French officers complained of the tardy movement of the ox-teams, which 
did not bring forward the tents till late at night, long after the troops 
had arrived at the end of their day's march. But the soldiers bore every 
inconvenience patiently and with perfect good humor. To encourage the 
troops, many of the officers marched on foot, and submitted to the same 
hardships and privations as the soldiers. The Abbe Robin tells us, that 
tlie Viscount de Noailles performed the whole march from Providence to 
the North River on foot. -JSbujicari Voyage dans VAmirique, Sfc. p. 36. 

Count de Rochambeau wrote from Providence ; — " Of my recruits, 
tliat have been landed to-day at Boston, there are four hundred in a good 
condition to do duty, and two hundred and sixty attacked by the scur\'y. 
The four hundred will arrive here on Saturday. They will be incorpo- 
rated on Sunday, and on Monday tlie 18tli I shaU set off with the regi- 
ment of Bourbonnois. The horses, the artillery, and the wagons are ar- 
riving from different places, and I hope that the movement of every 
ren-iment will go on very regularly on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs- 
day. I shall leave here two companies of artillery, with my siege ar- 
tillery, that will be ready to be embarked." — MS. Letter, June 15th. 
The siege artillery was to go by sea when wanted, and was brought 
up to Providence for greater security. Gordon says tliat ffteen hundred 
recruits arrived at Boston. — History, Vol. IV. p. 123. This is not prob- 
able, as all the French accounts represent this reinforcement to have 
been between six and seven hundred men.

as soon as may conveniently be done. I am inducetl to 
appoint you to this command from your knowledge ol, 
and inlluence amongst, the inhabitants of that country. 

You will be pleased, therefore, to repair to Saratoga, 
and establish your head-quarters at that place, detain- 
ing with you four hundred of the troops from Massa- 
chusetts, and sending the other two hundred to Colonel 
Willett, who will remain in command on the Mohawk 
River, as his popularity in that country will enable him 
to render essential service there. 

In case of an incursion of the enemy, you will make 
such dispositions as you shall judge most advantageous 
for opposing them, and protecting the frontier, (not 
withdrawing the troops from the Moha%vk River.) I 
relv upon it, that you will use your utmost exertions to 
draw forth the force of the country from the Green 
Mountains, and all the contiguous territory ; and I doulit 
not your requisitions will be attended with success, as 
your personal influence must be unlimited amongst 
those people, at whose head you have formerly fought 
and conquered with so much reputation and glory. 

I request that you will be very particular in keeping 
up proper discipline, and preventing the troops from 
committing depredations upon the inhabitants. Believe 
me to be, dear Sir, &-c.* 

• The following extract from General Stark's reply is cliaractcristic. 

" I shall set out for Saratoga the beginning of next week, and on my 
passage shall hold a treaty with the Green Mountain Boys ; but, not hav- 
ing seen or been acquainted with Uiose turbulent sons of freedom for 
several years, I am at a loss to determine my reception. I hope it will 
be such as shall tend to the general good. I shall endeavour to give 
you a more particular account on my arrival at Saratoga. My health is 
not fully restored, but perhaps competent to my new command." — Der- 
ryfitld, July I'tlh. After arriving at Saratoga, he gave a favorable ac- 
count of tiie Green Mountain Boys, and stated as a proof of their fidelity 
and zeal, that a short time before, when there was an alarm from an in- 
road of the enemy on Hudson's River, more than five hundred of them 
came out immediately on horseback to repel the invaders.

Sir, 

I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
favor of the 23d instant irom Hartford. It would have 
given me the greatest pleasure could I have made it 
convenient to meet you at Newtown ; but independ- 
ently of many arrangements, which are necessary at 
the first taking of the field, I am detained by the hourly 
expectation of the Chevalier de la Luzerne. I am 
pleased to find, that your idea of the position, which 
will be proper for the troops under your command, co- 
incides exactly with my own ; and I shall be happy in 
giving your quartermaster-general every assistance in 
reconnoitring and marking out your camp. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Cobb, one of my aids-de-camp, 
will have the honor of delivering to you this letter, and 
will return to me with any despatch or message, which 
your Excellency may wish to communicate ; or, should 
you rather incline to come forward from Newtown 
before the army. Colonel Cobb will be proud to attend 
you. I shall be much obliged if your Excellency will

Dear Sir, 

Your opinion of the absolute necessity of a repeal 
of all Under laws, before a new species of paper, 
though upon ever so good an establishment, will gain 
credit with the public, is certainly founded upon rea- 
son and justified by experience. I am extremely 
obliged to you for the assistance you have already 
afforded us in the article of flour. Without that aid, 
we should have been already distressed ; and I must 
confess to you, that I see no prospect of being sup- 
plied, but through your means, as, by the last letters 
from the President and Council of Pennsylvania, I could 
expect little or nothing from that quarter. Whether 
the Assembly, in their present session, have adopted 
any more vigorous measures to obtain supplies, I have 
not yet been informed. 

General Schuyler a few days ago acquainted you, 
that there were more considerable quantities of flour 
upon the North River, than he had expected. The 
ease and cheapness of transporting any in that situa- 
tion will undoubtedly induce you to secure what may 
be in that quarter, should you find yourself enabled to 
extend your purchases. I have the honor to be, with 
perfect respect and esteem, &,c.

Head-Quarters, near Peekskill, 29 June, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

The last letter that I have had the pleasure of re- 
ceiving from you is dated the 3d instant.* I have 
since that heard a thousand vague reports of your sit- 
uation, and that of the enemy, but none of them sat- 
isfactory. I fear some of your letters have miscarried, 
as, from your usual punctuahty, I am certain you must 
have written in that time. 1 hope your next will con- 
firm the accounts, which I have this day received from 
General St. Clair, that Lord Cornwallis had retreated 
to the south side of James River. 

The army moved out of their quarters a few days 
ago, and have taken their first position on this ground. 
Count de Rochambeau, with the van of the French 
army, will be at Newtown, forty-two miles from hence, 
this night. You are acquainted with our general plan. 
Particulars I dare not enter into, before I am assured 



* That letter was written while Lafayette was retreating before Lord 
Cornwallis, and just as he was about to cross the Rapidan to form a 
junction with Wayne. — "I heartily wish, my dear General," said he, 
" that my conduct may be approved, particularly by you. My circum- 
stances have been peculiar, and in this state I have sometimes e.xperi- 
enced strange disappointments. Two of these, the stores at Charlottes- 
ville and the delay of the northern detachment, have given me much 
uneasiness and may be attended with bad consequences. Tliere is great 
slowness and great carelessness in this part of the world. But the m- 
tentions are good, and the people want to be awakened. Your pres- 
ence, my dear General, would do a great deal. Should these detach- 
ments be increased to three or four thousand, and the French army 
come this way, leaving one of our generals at Rhode Island, and two 
or three about New York and in the Jerseys, you might be on llie of- 
fensive in this quarter, and there would be a southern army in Caro- 
lina. Your presence would do immense good, but I should wish you 
to have a large force. General Washington, before he personally ap- 
pears, should be strong enough to liope success." — Camp, between the

Head-Quarters, Peekskill, 30 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

The enclosed letter to the Count de Rochambeau is 
of very great importance, and requires the utmost se- 
crecy in its communication. This idea you will con- 
vey to the Count before its delivery, to effect which 
you will first converse with the Chevalier Chastellux 
on the mode of its communication. Its object is to 
inform the Count, that 1 have in contemplation a very 
sudden surprise of some post of the enemy, which will 
be of very great importance in our operations, and 
which we have flattering expectations of obtaining ; to 
cover and support which, if obtained, we shall want the 
aid of the French army ; in which case, it will be neces- 
sary for the Count to push on his troops with greater 
haste, than he at present intends, and by a different 
route from that now in his view. The Duke de Lau- 
zun's legion is to advance. 

The movements, which I would wish to be made by 
the French army, are particularized in my letter to the

press the gentlemen with the miportance of their mo-

purpose for us to obtain advantages, which we may not 
be able to maintain. 

As the Count, with his troops, is now in a very dis- 
affected part of the country, and the Tories will be 
desirous to give every information in their power, the 
most profound secrecy will be necessary. Secrecy and 
despatch must prove the soul of success to the enter-

Should we be happy enough to succeed, and be able 
to hold om- conquest, the advantages will be greater 
than can be well imagined. But I cannot flatter my- 
self, that the enemy will permit the latter, unless I am 
suddenly and considerably reinforced. I shall march 
down the remainder of this army, and I have hopes that 
the French force will be near at hand by that time. 
But I shall, notwithstanding, direct die alarm-guns and

TO MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

The object of your present command, — consisting 
of two regiments, formed into four battalions, under the 
command of Colonel Scammell and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Sprout, of a detachment of artillery under the com- 
mand of Captain Burbeck, of the corps of watermen 
under the command of Major Darby, and the water- 
guard under the command of Captain Pray, — is to 
attempt the surprise of the enemy's posts upon the 
north end of York Island. 

My ideas, as to the most probable mode of attain- 
ing this object, have been minutely detailed in the sev- 
eral conversations which we have had upon the subject, 
and you have been furnished with such papers as I 
have been able to collect, and upon which my judg- 
ment has been formed. But it is not my wish, or de- 
sire, that these should be any restraint upon you. 
Your own observation and the circumstances of the 
moment must in a great degree govern you. 

The success of your enterprise depending absolutely 
upon secrecy and surprise, it w ill be wrong to prose- 
cute it a moment after you are discovered, unless the 
discovery is made so near the works, that you may, by 
a rapid movement, gain them before the enemy have 
time to recollect and put themselves in a posture of 
defence. Fort George, upon Laurel Hill, ought to be 
your primary object, because success at that place will 
open a communication with the main, afford an asylum 
to the troops, who may be disappointed in other at- 
tacks, and secure a retreat in case of necessity to the 
main body of the army. 

Should you carry Fort Knyphausen and Fort Tryon 



I'vRTlI.l THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. ^1 

only, you cannot witliuut infinite risk hold them, as we 
shall not be in a situation to support you trom without. 
I would therefore reeoniniend your tlaniaging them as 
niuch as you possibly can and relincjuisliing them. The 
artillery-men will be proportionahly divided for the three 
attacks ; each party will be provided with two lanterns 
and two rockets, one ol' which is to be fired in each 
work as soon as it is cai'ried. 

It" complete success should attend the enterprise, not 
a moment should be lost in drawing the boats across 
the Island from the North River into Ilacrlcm Creek, 
and securing them under the guns of Fort George, if 
circumstances will admit of it. But in case of a dis- 
appointment, and being obliged to retreat by water, 
and not being able to pass the enemy's ships and boats, 
the dernier resort must be a push over to the Jersey 
shore, and an abandonment of the boats, if they cannot 
be drawn up the bank and carried ofT on carriages. It 
will be very essential, that I should be made acquainted 
as early as possible with your success, and the extent 
of it. If complete, you will announce it by the firing 
of thirteen cannon, at one minute's interval, after all less 
firing and confusion have ceased. If Fort George only 
is carried, six cannon are to be fired in the same man- 
ner. For Fort Knyphausen, Tryon, or both of them, 
you need not give a signal, because you are, as before 
directed, immediately to relinquish them. 

The foregoing is upon a supposition, that the prin- 
cipal object, the attempt upon the works on York 
Island, is carried into execution ; hut, should you, upon 
reconnoitring the enemy to-morrow, find it unadvisable 
to prosecute the plan, or should you be obliged to give 
it over on account of an early discovery by the enemy's 
shipping or boats, I would then have you turn your at- 
tention to the support of an attempt, which is also to

be made on the morning of the 3d by the Duke de 
Lauzun upon Delancey's corps lying at Morrisania. 
To effect this, you will land your men at any conven- 
ient place above the mouth of Sphen Devil Creek, 
and march to the high grounds in front of Kingsbridge, 
where you will lie concealed until the Duke's attack is 
announced by firing or other means. You may then 
dispose of your force in such a manner, in view of the 
enemy, as to make them think your party larger than 
it is, which may have the double effect of preventing 
them from coming over the bridge to turn the Duke's 
right, and also of preventing any of Delancey's party 
from escaping that way. Your further operations must 
depend upon the movements of the enemy and other 
circumstances. 

I expect to be in the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge 
early in the morning of the 3d, with the remainder of 
the army. I shall as soon as possible open a commu- 
nication with you, and give you such orders as the 
general state of matters may require. If you land up- 
on the east side of the river, above the mouth of Spi- 
ten Devil Creek, you will send your boats up along 
the east shore. If Major Darby receives no particular 
directions from me, he will proceed with them to King's 
Ferry. Given at Head-Quarters, near Peekskill, this

that place on the "id instant. I am now to inform you, 
that you will also be joined at the same time and place 
by the French legion, under the command of the Duke 
de Lauzun, who is a brigadier in the service of his 
Most Christian Majesty, and an oflicer of distinction, 
long service, and merit. The Duke is to command all 
the troops, that will be assembled at the point men-

put yourself and troops under his orders and command, 
he being furnished with my instructions for his move- 
ment subsequent to meeting you at Clapp's. 

As the Duke will be a stranger to that part of the 
country, which is to be the scene of your operations, 
it will be in vour power to give him much assistance 
and information, which I have not a doubt but you will 
do with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity. The

caution, attention, and despatch. I am. Sir, &,c.

I have this morning received your Excellency's favor 
of last evening. I think it will be very well for your 
Excellency to proceed to-morrow to North Castle, 
where you will continue until you assemble yoiu- whole

Being at North Castle will put you in a direct route 
to receive your provisions from Crompond, and it will 
be in a direct way for your troops to advance to White 
Plains, or any other point below, as circumstances shall 
appear to demand.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX, AT NEW WINDSOR. 

Head-Quarters, PeeksWll, 2 July, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

The arrangement you have made, for the periods 
of transportation of the heavy stores from Philadelphia, 
agrees perfectly with my ideas of the matter ; as I think 
we must be certainly able to determine ultimately up- 
on our plan of operations by the time they are to be 
in motion. 

An enterprise, which I have long had in contempla- 
tion, will be executed in the course of this night, if 
General Lincoln, who commands the operating party, 
finds the attack advisable upon reconnoitring the situ- 
ation of the enemy, and he can do it by surprise. 
The enterprise is against the posts upon the north 
end of York Island. The remainder of the army 
marched this morning towards Kingsbridge. Part of 
the French troops were last night at Ridgebury, and 
will be at Bedford this evening. They will, in the 
course of to-morrow, be at hand to support us, should 
there be occasion. At the same time that the posts 
upon York Island are attempted, I have planned a sur- 
prise upon Delancey's corps at Morrisania, which is

to be executed by the Duke tie Lauzun in conjunc- 
tion witii Slu'kK)n's rot;iinent and Waterbury's State 
troops. 

Should we succeed in the attempt upon the posts, 
every eflbrt will be made to hold them, and your as- 
sistance will be niatorially necessary. I shall take the 
speediest method of conununicating the event to Gen- 
eral M<^Doug;ill at West Point, who will bring out the 
militia to our support. You may therefore take it for 
granted, that we have succeeded, if you see or hear 
the signals. You will in such case come immediately 
down, leaving Colonel Stevens to put every thing in 
readiness to follow. I am, &,c.

Sir, 

Count Fersen will do me the favor to deliver this 
to your Excellency. The operations of this day are 
over, and I am sorry to say, that I have not had the 
happiness to succeed to my wishes, although I think 
very essential benefit will result to our future opera- 
tions from the opportunity I have had, in a very full 
manner, to reconnoitre the position and works of the 
enemy on the north end of Yoi-k Island. The piu-ticu- 
lar events of the day I shall do myself the honor to 
communicate, when I have the pleasure to join your 
Excellency. 

The American army and the legion of the Duke de 
Lauzun will march to-morrow to White Plains. If it 
will be convenient to you, 1 shall be happy to receive 
your Excellency with your troops at that place the day 
after to-morrow. When I shall have an opportunity to

converse with your Excellency, I conceive I shall be 
able to give you such reasons for forming your junc- 
tion at White Plains in the first instance, as will sat- 
isfy you of the utility and fitness of the position for 
commencing the preparations for om- concerted opera- 
tions of the campaign.

I to give way to the anxiety I feel to see the union 
between your army and mine, I should request you 
to march to-morrow morning from North Castle ; but 
when I consider the fatigue, which your troops have 
undergone from their long and rapid marches at this 
ver}^ warm season, I am much inclined to wish you 
to give them one more day's rest in your present 
quarters, and the more so, as there is now no real 
occasion for making an micommon degree of haste. 
I shall however leave the matter entirely to your Ex-

And the General also takes occasion to thank the officers and men of

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

iIcad-Q,uarters, near Dobbs's Ferry, 6 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency, 
that the army marched from their camp near Peekskill 
on the morning of the 2d, without either tents or bag- 
gage, and reached Valentine's Hill, about four miles on 
this side of Kingsbridge, a little alter dayliglit the 
morning following. 

General Lincoln, with a detachment of eight hundred 
men, fell down the North River in boats, landed near 
Pliillips's House before daylight on the morning of the 
3d, and took possession of the ground on this side of 
Haerlerp River, near where Fort Independence stood. 
This movement was principally intended to support and 
favor an enterprise, which I had projected against a 
corps of refugees under the command of Colonel De- 
lancey at Morrisania, and other light troops without the 
bridge, and which was to have been executed by the 
Duke de Lauzun with his own legion, Colonel Shel- 
don's regiment, and a detachment of State troops of 
Connecticut under the command of Brigadier-General 
Waterbury. The Duke, notwithstanding the heat of 
the day of the 2d, marched from Ridgebury, in Con- 
necticut, and reached East Chester very early next 
morning; but, upon his arrival there, finding by the 
firing that General Lincoln had been attacked, and the

alarm given, he desisted from a frirther prosecution of 
his plan (which could only have been executed to any 
effect by surprise), and marched to the General's sup- 
port, who continued skirmishing with the enemy and 
endeavouring to draw them so far into the country, that 
the Duke might turn their right and cut them off from 
their work on the east side of Haerlem River, and also 
prevent their repassing that river in boats. General 
Parsons had possessed the heights immediately com- 
manding Kingsbridge, and could have prevented their 
escape by that passage. Every endeavour of this kind 
proved fruitless ; for I found, upon going down myself 
to reconnoitre their situation, that all their force, except 
very small parties of observation, had retired to York 
Island. This afforded General Duportail and myself 
the most favorable opportunity of perfectly reconnoi- 
tring the works upon the north end of the Island, and 
making observations, which may be of very great ad- 
vantage in future. Finding nothing further could be 
done, I returned the day before yesterday to this 
ground, where I expect to be joined this day by his 
Excellency the Count de Rochambeau, who reached 
North Castle on the 2d instant. 

I cannot too warmly express the obligations I am un- 
der to the Count, for the readiness with which he de- 
tached the Duke de Lauzun, and for the rapidity with 
which he pushed the march of his main body, that he 
might have been within supporting distance, had any fa- 
vorable stroke upon the enemy below given us an op- 
portunity of pursuing any advantage, which might have 
been gained. General Lincoln had five or six men 
killed and about thirty wounded in his skirmish. 

I have the honor to be, &c.*

TO THE MAKIUI>' I"- 1-AKAYETTE. 

IIcail-Quartcrs, near Dobbs's Ferry, 1:5 July, 1781. 

INIy dear Maikui'^, 
I sincerely congratulate you on the favorable turn of 
afliiirs announced in your last, and I hope you will be 
enabled to maintain that superiority, which you seem 

dark, at or near Teller's Point ; ami, as his operations were to be tlic 
movements of two nights, he was desired to repair to Fort Lee this day, 
and reconnoitre the enemy's works, position, and strength, as well as he 
possibly could, and take his ultimate determination from appearances ; 
that is, to attempt the surprise, if tiie prospect was iiivorable, or to re- 
linquish it, if it was not ; and in the latter case to land above the montli 
of Spiten Devil, and cover the Duke de Lauzun in his operation on Dc- 
lancey's corps. At tlirce o'clock this morning I commenced my march 
with the Continental army, in order to cover the detached troops and 
improve any advantages, which might be gained by them. I made a 
small halt at the New Bridge over Croton about nine miles from Peeks- 
kill, another at the church by Tarrytown till dusk (nine miles more), 
and completed the remaining part of the march in tlie night, arriving 
at Valentine's Hill (at Mile Square) about sunrise. Our baggage and 
tents were left standing at the camp at Peekskill. 

"3rf. — The length of the Duke de Lauzun's march, and the fatigue 
of his corps, prevented his coming to the point of action at the hour ap- 
pointed. In tlic mean time General Lincoln's party, who were ordered to 
prevent the retreat of Delanccy's corps by the way of Kingsbridge, and 
prevent succours by that route, were attacked by the Vagers and others ; 
but, on the march of tlie army from Valentine's Hill, they retired to the 
Island. Being disappointed in botli objects, from the causes mentioned, 
I did not care to fatigue tlie troops any more, but suffered them to remain 
on their arms, while I spent a good part of the day in reconnoitring the 
enemy's works. In the afternoon wc retired to Valentine's Hill, and lay 
upon our arms. The Duke de Lauzun and General Watorbury lay on 
the east side of the Brun.\ River on tlie East Chester road. 

" 4lh. — Marched and took a position a little to the left of Dobbs's 
Ferry, and marked a camp for the French army upon our left. The Duke 
de Lauzun marched to White Plains, and Waterbury to Horseneck. 

" 5th. — Visited the French army, which had arrived at North Castle. 

"6th. — The French army formed the junction with the American on 
the grounds marked out. The legion of Lauzun took a position in ad- 
vance of the Plains on Chatterton's Hill, west of the River Brun.x. This 
day also the minister of France arrived in camp from Philadelphia." 

The American army was encamped in two lines, with the right resting 
on Hudson's River near Dobbs's Ferry. The French army was stationed 



100 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

to be gaining over Lord Cornwallis.* We have had a 
variety of reports of General Greene's further successes 
in South Carolina. By some we are told, that both 
Augusta and Ninety-Six have fallen, but in a letter, 
which I have just received from Monsieur Marbois, he 
says that Augusta has been taken, and the siege of 
Ninety-Six raised. Count de Rochambeau formed a 
junction with me at the camp, about twelve miles from 
Kingsbridge, a few days ago. We are waiting for re- 



on the hills at the left, in a single line reaching to tlie Brunx River. 
There was a valley of considerable extent between the two armies. 

From the Orderly Book, July 6(ft. — " The Commander-in-chief with 
pleasure embraces the earliest public opportunity of expressing his thanks 
to his Excellency, the Count de Rochambeau, for the unremitting zeal 
with which he has prosecuted his march, in order to form the long wished- 
for junction between the French and American forces ; an event, which 
must afford the highest degree of pleasure to every friend of his coun- 
try, and from which the happiest consequences are to be expected. The 
General entreats his Excellency, the Count de Rochambeau, to convey to 
tlie officers and soldiers under his immediate command the grateful sense 
he entertains of the cheerfulness, with which they have performed so 
lontT and laborious a march at this hot season. The regiment of Sain- 
tonge is entitled to peculiar acknowledgments for tlie spirit, with which 
they continued and supported their march without one day's respite." 

* A retreat had been recently commenced by Lord Cornwallis, after 
pursuing Lafayette to the interior of Virginia. In the letter referred to 
above, Lafayette said ; 

" The enemy have been so kind as to retire before us. Twice I gave 
Ihem a chance of fighting (taking care not to engage farther than I 
pleased), but they continued their retrograde motion. Our number is, I 
think, exaggerated to them, and our seeming boldness confirms the opin- 
ion. I thought at first that Lord Cornwallis wanted to get me down as 
low as possible, and use the cavalry to advantage. But it appears he 
does not as yet come out, and our position wiD admit of partial affairs. 
His Lordship had {exclusive of the riflemen from Portsmouth, said to be 
six hundred,) four thousand men, eight hundred of whom were dragoons 
or mounted infantry. Our force is about equal to his ; but only fifteen 
hundred are regulars, and fifty dragoons. Our little action marks the re- 
treat of the enemy. From the place, at which they first began to retreat, 
to Williamsburg is upwards of one hundred miles. His Lordship has 
done us no harm of any consequence. He has lost a very large part of 
his former conquests, and has not made any in this State. General 
Greene demanded of me only to hold my ground in Virginia ; but the

inforcements to the Continental line, and for militiix, and 
are in the mean time establishing our communication at 
Dohbs's Ferry. 

I shall shortly have occasion to communicate matters 
of very great importance to you, so much so, that I 
shall send a confidential ofiicer on purpose. You will 
in the mean time endeavour to draw together as re- 
spectable a body of Continental troops as you possibly 
can, and take every measure to augment your cavalry. 
Should the enemy confine themselves to the lower 

movements of Lord Cornwallis may answer better purposes tlian that in 
Uie military line." — MS. Ldter, June 28/A. 

In tlie following letter to llie governor of Virginia of the same date, 
Lafayette gives an account of the recent action. 

"Colonel Simcoe was so lucky as to avoid a part of the stroke ; but, 
although the whole of the light corps could not arrive in time, some of 
them did. Major Macpherson, having taken up tif\y light infantry be- 
hind fifty dragoons, overtook Simcoe, and, regardless of numbers, made 
an immediate charge. He was supported by the riflemen, who behaved 
most gallantly and did great execution. The alarm-guns were fired at 
Williamsburg (only six miles distant from the field). A detachment just 
then going to Gloucester was recalled, and the whole British army came 
out to save Simcoe. They retired next morning, when our army got 
within striking distance. 

" Our loss is two captains, two lieutenants, ten privates wounded ; two 
lieutenants, one sergeant, six privates killed ; one lieutenant, twelve 
privates, whose fate is not known ; one sergeant taken. The enemy had 
about sLxty kUled, among whom are several officers, and about one hun- 
dred wounded. They acknowledge the action was smart, and Lord Corn- 
wallis was heard to express himself vehemently upon the disproportion 
between his and our killed, wliich must be attributed to tlie great skill 
of our riflemen. This little success has given great satisfaction to the 
troops, and increased their ardor. I have put all tlie riflemen under 
Campbell. To-morrow I intend to reconnoitre a position below Byrd's 
Ordinary. Your return to Richmond, and this little affair, will particu- 
larly mark his Lordship's retreat, and the recovery of every part of the 
State not under naval protection." — MS. Letter, June i^th. 

Count de Rochambeau, speaking of tliis skirmish in a letter to the 
minister of war in France, said, " The Marquis de Lafayette haa con- 
ducted himself extremely well during this campaign in Virginia ; ad- 
vancing upon the enemy and retreating, as occasion required, with pru- 
dence and skill."

country, you will no doubt pay attention to the forma- 
tion of magazines above. These will be in every case 
essential, whether the war continues in Virginia, or 
whether it shall still be carried on in South Carolina. 
Should General Greene come into Virginia in person, 
you will be good enough to communicate the forego- 
ing to him. 

In the present situation of affairs, it is of the utmost 
importance that a communication by a chain of expres- 
ses should be opened between this army and that in 
Virginia. They are already established from hence to 
Philadelphia, and if there is none from you to Phila- 
delphia, you will be pleased to take measures for hav- 
ing it formed. You will also endeavour to estabhsh 
such a communication with the coast, as to be able to 
know whether any troops are detached by sea from 
Lord Cornwallis's army ; for it is more than probable, 
that, if he finds himself baffled in attempting to over- 
run Virginia, he will take a strong post at Portsmouth, 
or Williamsburg, and reinforce New York or South 
Carolina. Should any detachment be made, you will 
transmit to me the earliest intelligence. What you say 
in confidence of the conduct of a certain officer shall 
be kept a profound secret, and I will contrive means 
of removing him from the quarter where he is so un- 
popular. 

The Rhode Island regiment is so thinly officered, 
that Colonel Olney wishes one of the subalterns of the 
light company may be suffered to return, when Cap- 
tain Olney joins. You will act in this as circumstances 
may permit. You have the compliments and good 
wishes of all your friends in the French army. Those 
of the American are not behindhand with them. With 
the warmest affection and esteem, I am, &c.

[IcaU-Quartcrs, near Dobba'ii Ferry, 13 July, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
Your favors of the 2d and 5th instant have afforded 
me infinite satisfaction, as the measures you are pursu- 
ing lor subsisting the army perfectly accord with my 
ideas, and are, I am certain, the only ones, which can 
secure us from distress or the constant apprehensions 
of it.* Had magazines of any consequence been form- 
ed in the ditlerent States, in pursuance of the late re- 
quisitions of Congress, the disposal of the articles col- 
lected at a distance from the army would have merited 
your attention ; but so httle has been done in that way, 
that I imagine you will not think the matter worthy of 
notice, when I inform you of the trilling quantities 
which remain on hand. No magazines of flour have 
been formed at any place. No salt meat was put up 
in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or New York. There had 
been, by estimate, seven or eight thousand barrels of 
meat and fish put up in Connecticut, of which between 
two and three thousand have come forward, and the re- 
mainder is, I believe, in motion. Massachusetts put up 

• By a resolve of Congress, Robert Morris, as superintendent of fi- 
nance, was vested witli powers to dispose of the specific supplies, which 
had been required to be furnished by the several States, in such manner 
as he, with the advice of the Commander-in-chief, should judge best suit- 
ed to promote the public interest, and answer the purposes of the present 
campaign. — Journals, June Ath. It was the opinion of Mr. Morris, that all 
these supplies should be sold, on the best terms that could be obtained, 
and that the army should in future be supplied by contracts. The plan 
of specific supplies had proved very inoperative, both from the tardiness 
of the States in complying with the requisitions, and from the great ex- 
pense attending transportation. In some instances, where the magazines 
were distant, the articles could be bouglit and furnished near the army for 
a less amount, tlian it would cost to transport them from tlie places of 
deposit 



104 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 49. 

very little salt meat, and most of it has been consumed 
upon the communication by the recruits, or transported 
to Albany. Rhode Island purchased one thousand bar- 
rels, of which about six hundred remain at Providence, 
and I would wish them to be still kept there for a par- 
ticular purpose. I could never learn, with certainty, 
how much was put up in New Hampshire ; but I have 
directed all that was at Portsmouth to be transported 
by water to Providence, as I wish to form a small mag- 
azine of salt provision at that place, as I mentioned 
before, for a particular purpose. No magazines of rum 
have been formed. We have been in a manner desti- 
tute of that necessary article, and what we are now 
likely to draw from the several States will be from hand 
to mouth. From the foregoing state of facts you will 
perceive in how small a degree the requisitions of 
Congress have been complied with, and may form a 
judgment of the miserable manner in which the army 
has been subsisted. 

Having lately, at the request of the Board of War, 
furnished them with my opinion of the quantity of pro- 
vision, which ought to be laid up at the several posts, 
they will be able, at the interview which you propose 
to have with them, to lay before you my ideas upon the 
subject of a contract for supplying the army. I beg 
you to be assured, that I never can think your corre- 
spondence tedious or troublesome. Duty as well as 
inclination will always prompt me to listen with pleas- 
ure to your observations upon the state of our public 
affairs ; and I shall think myself happy, if I can in any 
manner contribute to assist you in the arduous task 
you have undertaken. I shall very anxiously wait for 
the visit, which you promise to make me. I am, with 
very sincere respect and esteem, &c.

the security of the baggage and stores left in it. There 
will be no need of advanced pickets, as you will be 
fully covered in front. The camp guards should he 
vigilant, and the olHcers commanding them should see 
that the men are not permitted to straggle, or to plun- 
der the baggage of the officers and soldiers. 

The greatest harmony having hitherto subsisted be- 
tween the French and American soldiers, your Lordship 
will be particularly careful to see that it is not inter- 
rupted by any act of imprudence on our part ; and, as 
Baron Viomenil, who will command the French line, is 
older in commission than your Lordship, you will take 
the parole and countersign from him daily. It is 
scarcely probable that the enemy will make any at- 
tempt upon the camp, while so respectable a force is 
near their own lines. Should they tlo it, it must be by 
water. The ollicer commanding the water-guard will 
communicate anv movement to Colonel Greaton at 
Dobbs's Ferry, who will give immediate intelligence 
to you, which you will of course transmit to Baron 
Viomenil. The party at Dobbs's Ferry being for the 
purpose of erecting a work there, they are not to be 
withdrawn for camp duties. I am, &,c.

106 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

TO RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Camp, near Dobbs's Ferry, 15 July, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
The moving state in which the army was at the time 
yom- letter of the 12th uUimo came to hand, the junc- 
tion of the alhed troops at that period, and a variety 
of matters which have occurred since the junction, and 
consequent thereon, rather than a disinclination to con- 
tinue a correspondence, the benefits of which were in 
my favor, must plead as an excuse for my silence till 
now. Unconscious of having given you just cause to 
change the favorable sentiments you have expressed for 
me, I could not suppose an alteration on your part; 
and, as I never suffer reports, unsupported by proofs, 
to have weight in my mind, I know no reason why our 
correspondence should cease, or become less frequent 
than heretofore, excepting on my part, that, as our af- 
fairs get more or less involved in pei'plexity, my atten- 
tion is proportionably engaged, and more or less leis- 
ure is allowed for indulgences.* 

* It will be recollected, that the name of Richard Henry Lee occurs 
in the papers relating to Conwat/'s Cabal, and he was supposed by some 
persons to take a part hostile to Washington in that affair. This opin- 
ion seems never to have been sustained by any other evidence than sus- 
picion. It had the effect, however, to break off the intimacy, which pre- 
viously existed between the two friends. On the present occasion, Mr. 
Lee made tlie first advance, and commenced his letter in the following 
words. 

" Althongli our correspondence has been long interrupted, I hope that 
our friendship never will be, notwithstanding the arts of wicked men, who 
have endeavoured to create discord and dissension among the friends 
of America. For myself, having little but my good wishes to send you, 
it was not worth while to take up your attention a moment with them. 
The contents of this letter will, I am sure, require no apology, because 
you always approve that zeal, which is employed in the public service, 
and has for its object the public good" 

He then proceeds to describe the situation of things in Virginia, with 
the enemy in the heart of the State and an inferior force to resist 



Part II.; 'I' 1 1 T. A M K IM C A N U K V ( ) I. T T I ON . IU7 

That wo have hail a very cDinpeteiit portion, and a 
great variety of ilillicullies of late, a person, so well in- 
formed of public matters as you are, needs not be told. 
The distresses of Virginia I am but too well acquaint- 
ed w ith ; but the plan you have suggested as a relief for 
it is, in my judgment, a greater proof of your unbound- 
ed confidence in me, than it is, that your means pro- 
posed would be found adequate to the end in view, 
were it practicable to make the experiment, which at 
present it is not, as there are insuperable obstacles to 
my removing from the immediate command of the 
anxiliary troops. 

The reasons for this opinion I cannot commit to pa- 
per, at all times liable to miscarriage, but peculiarly so 
of late. I am fully persuaded, however, and upon good 
military principles, that the measures I have adopted 
will give more effectual and speedy relief to the State 
of Virginia, than my marching thither with dictatorial 
powers, at the head of every man I could draw from 

them, and the dangers that threatened upon every side. "It would bo 
a thing for angels to weep over," said he, " if the goodly fabric of hu- 
man freedom, which you have so well labored to rear, should in one 
unlucky moment be levelled with the dust. There is nothing I think 
more certain, than that your personal call would bring into immediate 
exertion the force and the resources of this State and the neighbouring 
ones, which, directed as they would be, will effectually disappoint and 
baffle the deep laid schemes of the enemy." 

In this letter Mr. Lee enclosed a copy of one, which he had written 
to some of the members of Congress, and in which he had expressed 
himself as follows. 

" Let General Washington be immediately sent to Virginia, with two 
or three thousand good troops. Let Congress, as the head of the fed- 
eral union, in this crisis direct, that, until a legislature can convene and 
a governor be appointed, the General be possessed of dictatorial pow- 
ers, and that it be strongly recommended to the Assembly, when con- 
vened, to continue those powers for si.x, eight, or ten months, as the 
case may be ; and that the General may be desired instantly on his ar- 
rival in Virginia to summon the members of both Houses to meet where 
he shall appoint, to organize and resettle their government" — jWS. Let- 
lers, ChaiUUhj, June Vith.

hence, without leaving the important posts on the North 
River quite defenceless, and these States open to de- 
vastation and ruin. When I say this, I would be un- 
derstood to mean, if I am properly supported by the 
States eastward of Jersey inclusive. My present plan 
of operation, which I have been preparing with all the 
zeal and activity in my power, will, I am morally cer- 
tain, with proper support produce one of two things ; 
either the fall of New York, or a withdrawal of the 
troops from Virginia, excepting a garrison at Ports- 
mouth, at which place, I have no doubt of the enemy's 
intention of establishing a permanent post. A long 
land march, in which we have never failed to dissipate 
half of our men, the difficulty and expense of trans- 
portation, and other reasons not less powerful, but 
which I dare not commit to writing, decided me in 
my present plan ; and my hopes, I trust, will not be 
disappointed. 

In half an hour's conversation I could, I think, con- 
vince you of the utility of my plan ; but, as I have 
before observed, I do not attempt it by letter, because 
I have already had two important ones intercepted in 
the mails, the sight of which, I am persuaded, occasion- 
ed the retrograde movements of Lord Cornvvallis, and 
will be the means of bringing a part of his force to 
New York, to the accompUshment of one part of my 
expectation. 

No endeavours of mine have been wanting to ob- 
tain a naval superiority in these seas, nor to employ 
that which we have to valuable purposes. How far 1 
have succeeded in the latter is but too obvious ; how 
far I may see my wishes accomplished in the former, 
time must discover. With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear Sir, &c.

Head-Quarters, 21 July, 1781. 

Sir, 
The army will make a movement this evening. You 
will march your corps on the same route, anil in such 
time and manner as to be at East Chester between 
daybreak and sunrise. Your troops should be supplied, 
if possible, with three days' cooked provisions ; and the 
movements of the army, as well as of your troops, 
must be kept a secret until the moment you march.* 

• With a view of ascertaining the exact position of the enemy on tlie 
north end of New York Island, General Washington resolved to recon- 
noitre tlieir posts from the western shore of the Hudson. For this pur- 
pose, on the 18th of July, he crossed the river at Dobbs's Ferry, ac- 
companied by Count de Rochambeau, General de Seville, and General 
Duportail. They were attended by an escort of one hundred and fifty 
men from the Jersey troops, then stationed on the west side of the riv- 
er. The day was spent in reconnoitring from the high grounds between 
Dobbs's Ferry and Fort Lee. The subsequent manceuvres near Kings- 
bridge are briefly sketched in the following e.ilract from his Diary. 

" July 2UI. — I ordered about five thousand men to be ready to march 
at eight o'clock, for the purpose of reconnoitring tlie enemy's posts at 
Kingsbridge, and of cutting off, if possible, such of Delancey's corps as 
should be found without their lines. At the hour appointed the march 
commenced, in four columns, on different roads. Major-Gcneral Parsons 
with the Connecticut troops, and twenty-five of Sheldon's horse, formed 
the right column, with two field-pieces, on the North River road. The 
other two divisions, under Major-Generals Lincoln and Howe, together 
with the corps of sappers and miners, and four field-pieces, formed the 
next column on the Saw-mUl River road. The right column of the 
French, on our left, consisted of tlie brigade of Bourbonnois, witli the 
battalion of grenadiers and chasseurs, two field-pieces, and two twelve- 
pounders. Their left column was composed of the legion of Lauzun, one 
battalion of grenadiers and chasseurs, the regiment of Soissonnois, two 
field-pieces, and two howitzers. General Waterbury, with the militia and 
State troops of Connecticut, was to march on the East Chester road, and 
to be joined at that place by the cavalry of Sheldon, for the purpose of 
scouring Frog's Neck. Sheldon's infantry was to join the legion of Lau- 
zun and scour Morrisania, and to be covered by Scammell's light infantry, 
who were to advance through the fields, waylay the roads, stop all com- 
munication, and prevent intelligence from getting to the enemy. At 

VOL. VJII. J 



no WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

In order to prevent the enemy from obtaining any 
intelligence whatever from us, I have ordered small 
parties to waylay all the roads from the North River 
to East Chester. I must request that you will send an 
active subaltern and twenty men with good guides early 
this afternoon across the fields and woods from your 
encampment to some good position for an ambuscade, 
on the side of the road leading from New Rochelle to 

Valentine's Hill tlie left column of the American troops and right of the 
French formed their junction, as did the left of the French also, by mis- 
take, as it was intended it should cross the Brunx by Garrineau's and re- 
cross it at Williams's Bridge, i he whole army (Parsons's division first) 
arrived at Kingsbridge about daylight, and formed on the heights back 
of Fort Independence, extending towards Delancey's Mills ; while the 
legion of Lauzun and Waterbury's corps proceeded to scour Morrisania 
and Frog's Neck to little effect, as most of the Refugees had fled, and 
hid themselves in sucli obscure places as not to be discovered ; and by 
stealth got over to the islands adjacent, and to the enemy's shipping, 
which lay in the East River. A few, however, were caught, and some 
cattle and horses brought off. 

" July 22d. — The enemy did not appear to have had the least intelli- 
gence of our movement, or to know we were upon the heights opposite 
to them, till the whole army was ready to display itself After having 
fixed upon the ground, and formed our line, I began with General Ro- 
chambeau and the engineers to reconnoitre the enemy's position and 
works ; and first from Tippet's Hill opposite to their left. From thence it 
was evident, that the small redoubt (Fort Charles) near Kingsbridge 
would be absolutely at the command of a battery, which might be erect- 
ed thereon. It also appeared equally evident, that the fort on Cox's Hill 
was in bad repair, and little dependence placed in it. There is neither 
ditch nor friezing, and the nortlieast corner appears quite easy of access, 
occasioned as it would seem by a rock. The approach from the inner 
point is secured by a ledge of rocks, which would conceal a party from 
observation, till it got within about one hundred yards of the fort, 
around which, for tliat or a greater distance, the ground has little cov- 
ering of bushes upon it. There is a house on this side under Tippet's 
HUl, but out of view, I conceive, of the crossing-place most favora- 
ble to a partisan stroke. From this view, and every other I could get of 
Forts Tryon, Knyphausen, and Laurel Hill, the works are formidable. 
There are no barracks or huts on the east side of the hill, on which 
Forts Tryon and Knyphausen stand, nor are there any on the hill oppo- 
site, e.xcept those by Fort George. Near the Blue Bell there is a num- 
ber of houses, but they have more the appearance of stables than bar

East Chcstor, as near the latter as may be without 
liazard of iliscovery. This jiarty imisl remain perfectly 
concealed, with orders to appreiiend all persons going 
towards Kingsbridge. It is essential that your party 
should not be seen by the inhabitants, as this might 
frustrate the very object of our operations. You will 
be convinced. Sir, by your own experience and good 
sense, that the profoundest secrecy is absolutely neces- 
sary in all military matters, and in no instance more 

racks. In tlic hollow, near tlio barrier gate, are about fourteen or fifteen 
tents, which are the only encampment I could see without the line of pal- 
isades. A continued hill from the creek, east of Hnerlom River and a lit- 
tle below Morris's White House, has from every part of it the command of 
the opposite shore, and all the plain adjoining is within range of shot from 
batteries, which may be erected thereon. The general width of the riv- 
er, along this range of hills, appears to be from one hundred to two hun- 
dred yards. The opposite shore, though more or less marshy, does not 
seem miry, and the banks are very easy of access. How far the battery, 
under cover of the blockhouse on the hill northwest of Hacrlem town, is 
capable of scouring the plain, is difficult to determine from this side ; but 
It would seem as if the distance were too great to be within tiic range 
of its shot on that part of the plain nearest the creek before mentioned, 
and which is also nearest the heights back of our old lines thrown up in 
the year 177(5. It unfortunately happens, that, in the rear of tlie con- 
tinued hill before mentioned, there is a deep swamp, and the grounds west 
of that swamp are not so high as the heights near Hacrlem River. In 
the rear of this again is the Brunx, which is not to be crossed without 
boats below Dclancey's Mills. 

"JiUi/ 'i3il. — Went upon Frog's Neck to see what communication 
could be had with Long Island, and the engineers attended with instru- 
ments to measure the distance across. Having finished the reconnoitre 
without damage, a few harmless shot only being fired at us, we march- 
ed back about si.x o'clock by tlie same routes we went down, but in a 
reversed order of march, and arrived at camp about midnight" 

Supposing it probable, that Count de Grasso would shortly appear off 
Sandy Hook with his fleet, General Washington wrote to him, on the 
21st of July, in Count de Rochambeau's cipher, acquainting him with the 
Junction of the allied armies, their position and strength, and the force of 
the enemy ; and also explained the plans then in view as to future ope- 
rations. This letter was sent under cover to General Forman, at Mon- 
mouth, wiUi a request that he woidd keep look-outs on Uie heights, and, oa 
soon as tlie fleet should approach, go on board the fleet in person and 
deliver the letter to Count de Grasac.

TO THOMAS MCKEAN, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.* 

Head-Quarters, 21 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored by the receipt of your letter of 
the 14th and 17th of this month, with the several reso- 
lutions of Congi'ess, and the extracts from intercepted 
letters enclosed. I am obliged by your attention in the 
communication of the extracts, although I had been 
favored with them through another channel, previous 
to the receipt of yours. The intelligence to be col- 
lected from them, if properly improved, I think may 
turn greatly to our advantage.f 

I take this opportunity most sincerely to congratulate 
you, Sir, on the honor conferred on you by Congress, 
in being elected to preside in that most respectable 
body. Happy, as I expect to be in your correspon- 
dence, I dare say I shall have no reason to complain 
of the mode of your conducting it, as from a know- 
ledge of your character I flatter myself it will ever be 
performed with great propriety. I take _ the liberty, 
however, to request as a particular favor, that you will 
be so good as to convey to me, as you have opportu- 
nity, any interesting intelligence, which you may receive

either from Europe, or respecting our Continental af- 
fairs. Your situation will put it particularly in your 
power to oblige nie in tliis respect, and be assured, 
Sir, that a greater obligation cannot be conferred ; 
since, for want of communication in this way, I have 
often been left in tht- dark in matters, which essen- 
tially concern the public welfare, and which, if known, 
might be very inlluential in the government of my 
conduct in the militaiy line. 

I am very happy to be informed, by accounts from 
all parts of the continent, of the agreeable prospect 
of a very plentiful supply of almost all the produc- 
tions of the earth. Blessed as we are with the boun- 
ties of Providence, necessary for our support and de- 
fence, the fault must surely be our own, and great 
indeed will it be, if we do not by a proper use of 
them obtain the noble prize for which we have so 
long been contending, the establishment of liberty, 
peace, and independence. I am, dear Sir, &c. 



TO COUNT DE BARRAS. 

Head-Quarters, Dobbs's Fcrrj-, 21 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your Excellency's favor 
of the l.'jth instant. I have no doubt l)ut the reasons 
which induce you to decline the removal of the squad- 
ron under your command to the Chesapeake at this 
time are founded in propriety ; but I am certain, that, 
could the measure have taken place, it would have 
been attended with most valuable consequences, more 
especially as, from reports and appearances, the en- 
emy are about to bring part of their troops from Vir- 
ginia to New York. Although the detachments from

your fleet under the command of the Baron d'Angely 
did not succeed at Huntington, Ave are not the less 
obliged to your Excellency for directing the attempt 
to be made. If that post is maintained, I think an 
opportunity of striking it to advantage may still be 
found, and I doubt not but you will readily embrace 
it. I have the honor to be, &,c.* 



TO SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, IN CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, Dobbs's Ferry, 25 July, 1781. 

Sir, 
I have been honored with your favor of the 10th, 
announcing your resignation of the chair of Congress 
and the election of Mr. M^Kean to that important sta- 

* The reason assigned by M. de Barras for remaining at Newport was, 
that he thought it imprudent to risli any new enterprise, which might 
contravene the general plan of operations, and retard his junction with 
Count de Grasse. A few days afterwards (July 30), General Washington 
wrote in his Diartj, that Count de Barras liad expressed himself in stdl 
stronger terms against a removal from Newport. " This induced me," 
said he, " to desist from furtlier representing the advantages, which would 
result from preventing a junction of the enemy's force at New York, and 
blocldng up those now in Virginia ; lest in the attempt any disaster should 
happen, and the loss of or damage to his fleet should be ascribed to my 
obstinacy in urging a measure, to which his own judgment was opposed, 
and the e.xecution of which might impede his junction with the West In- 
dia fleet, and thwart the views of the Count de Grasse upon this coast." 

A large body of refugees was stationed at Lloyd's Neck, near Hun- 
tington Bay, where they had built a fort and provided other means of de- 
fence. A project had been for some time in view to attack and drive 
them from this post. Having no employment for his squadron at New- 
port, Count de Barras detached for this service three frigates with two 
hundred and fifty land troops, the whole under the command of the Baron 
d'Angely. The detachment sailed on the 10th of July, and was joined 
in the Sound by several boats with American volunteers and pilots from 
Fairfield. A landing was effected in the morning of the 12th near the 
fort at Lloyd's Neck ; but it was soon discovered, that tlie place was 
much stronger than had been supposed, and not to be carried without

tion. I flattered myself with the liope of an opportu- 
nity of personally aclcnovvledging the attentions, which 
I received from you iluring > our presidency ; but as I 
find you could not with convenience make a visit to 
the army on your way home, I am constrained to 
take this methoil of returning my thanks and express- 
ing mv sincere wishes for the rei-stablishment of your 
health. I am exceedingly happy to hear, that our po- 
litical afl'airs begin to assume a new and pleasing ap- 
pearance, which, if continued, will I hope have an in- 
fluence upon the military. That department is yet 
laboring under every difliculty and distress, and there 
seems to me little chance of its being relieved from 
the debility to which it is reduced ; for, notwithstand- 
ing my pressing requisitions, and the more pressing 
occasion w hich there is for recruits at this moment, I 
may almost say I have not received one man since 
my last demand. 

The station, which you have lately filled -with so 
much honor, has given you an opportunity of making 
yourself intimately acciuainted \\ ith our real situation ; 
and a representation from you to your State will natu- 
rally have more weight, than that of a stranger to pub- 
lic artairs. Be assured. Sir, you cannot employ your 
time better at home, than in constantly impressing all 
ranks with the necessity of recruiting and supplying 
the army. I have the honor to be, &c.

barked. Two or three men were wounded by a cannon-shot from the 
fort. The enemy's vessels went up a river beyond tlie reach of tlio 
French frigates, so that no damage wa.i done to thorn. The expedi- 
tion was throughout a failure. — MS. Letter of Count de Barras, July loth.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 30 July, 1781. 

My dear Sir, 

With peculiar satisfaction I do myself the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of your several favors, and to 
assure you at the same time, that it is with the warm- 
est pleasure I express my full approbation of the va- 
rious movements and operations, which your military 
conduct has lately exhibited; while I confess to you 
that I am unable to conceive what more could have 
been done under your circumstances, than has been 
displayed by your little persevering and determined 
army. Lord Rawdon's reinforcement from England 
was a most untoward circumstance ; but even this, I 
hope, will soon be surmounted by your good fortune. 

You will be informed from the Marquis, of every 
circumstance that has taken place in Virginia. A de- 
tachment from the army of this brave and fortunate 
young nobleman will, I hope, soon ai'rive to your as- 
sistance in Carolina. 

By our movements in this quarter, and the main ar- 
my taking a position near New York, and making every 
preparation for a serious attempt upon that place, we 
have already produced a happy effect, that of a with- 
drawal of a considerable part of the troops under the 
command of Lord Cornvvallis as a reinforcement to 
their garrison, which has been some time past closely 
confined to York Island. This withdrawal will proba- 
bly disappoint their views of conquest in Virginia, and 
will exceedingly embarrass the prospects of the British 
ministry in the proposed treaty to be opened at Vien- 
na.* This is a very great object, even should any

thing prevent our obtaining further success in our op- 
erations against New York. 

The operating force of the enemy in the southern 
States being confined in all probability to South Caro- 
lina, will leave the other States in a condition to afford 
you such succours as, with the aid of the Marquis's 
detachment, will, I trust, enable you to fulfil your hopes 
and wi^«lles in their utmost extent in your conimaiitl. 
Should this event take place, you may be assured, that, 
added to the honor that will be thereby reflected on 
your own person, it will aflbrd me the highest satisfoc- 
tion. I sincerely wish we had the means of communi- 
cating more frequently with each other. Be assured. 
Sir, my concern for your honor and welfare interests 
me most particularly in every event which attends you. 

A reason, which cannot at this time be communi- 
cated, induces me to request that you will be pleased 
to give me the earliest and most minute information 
of every event, that takes place ^vith you, and a circum- 
stantial detail of the present situation of the State of 
South Carolina, its strength and operative force, with 
its resources for the support of an army, and the ex- 
tent of those resources, with the places where they 
may be collected and secured ; also the strength, posi- 
tion, and circumstances attending the enemy's force.

ment from his army, as soon as he should have established himself in

no part of Lord Cornwallis's army left Virginia for the purpose of re- 
inforcing Sir Henry Clinton. — See the correspondence in Lord Com-

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Head-Quarters, 30 July, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favors of 
the 8th and 20th instant. The first relieved me from 
much anxiety, as I had seen Mr. Rivington's account 
of the action at Green Spring, which you may suppose 
was highly colored in their favor.* You ask my opin- 
ion of the Virginia campaign. Be assured, my dear 
Marquis, your conduct meets my warmest approbation, 
as it must that of every body. Should it ever be said, 
that my attachment to you betrayed me into partiality, 
you have only to appeal to facts to refute any such 
charge. But I trust there will be no occasion.f 

Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton will join the advanced corps under the or- 
ders of Colonel ScammelL" 

* See an account of this engagement in Marshall's Life of Wash- 
ington, Vol. IV. p. 442. For a short time the action was very warm. In 
describing it General Wayne wrote ; " Our field-officers were generally

Colonel Mercer, and anotlier young Virginia gentleman, were not more 
fortunate. I will not condole with the Marquis for the loss of two of his, 
as he was frequently requested to keep at a greater distance. His na- 
tive bravery rendered him deaf to the admonition." — July Sth. By Lord 
Cornwallis's official return, his loss was eleven killed, sixty-six wounded, 
and one missing. The American loss was five captains, one captain- 
lieutenant, four lieutenants, eleven sergeants, and one hundred and 
eighteen rank and file, killed, wounded, and missing. 

t Lafayette to General Jfashington. — "I am anxious to know your 
opinion concerning the Virginia campaign. That the subjugation of this 
State was the great object with the ministry is an indisputable fact. I 
think your diversion lias been of more use to the State, than my manoeu- 
vres ; but the latter have been much directed by political views. So long 
as Lord Cornwallis wished for an action, not one gun was fired ; from the 
moment he declined it, we have been skmnishing ; but I took care not to 
commit the army. His naval superiority, his superiority of horse and of 
regulars, his thousand advantages over us were such, that I am lucky 
enough to have come off safe. I had an eye upon European negotia- 
tions, and made it a point to give his Lordship the disgrace of a retreat.

and as strongly as possible. 11' lie can only maintain 
the advimtages he has already gained in the Carolinas

fcrent figure in the political scene from that, which it 
is plain they expected, by Lord George Germain's let- 
ters of March last. 

Private Letter, July 30th. — T take your private 
letter of the 20th in the light which you wish it, that 
of an unreserved communication from one friend to 
another ; and I should be wanting in candor, were I 
not to expose my sentiments to you in as free a man- 
ner. I am convinced, that your desire to be with 
this army arises principally from a wish to be actively 
useful. You will not, therefore, regret your stay in 
Virginia uniil matters are reduced to a greater degree 
of certainty, than they are at present, especially when 
I tell you, that, from the change of circumstances 
with which the removal of part of the enemy's force 

send Tarleton into Amelia, but was disappointed in the stores, wliicli he 
expected to find, and which had been previously removed. I thought at 
first the cavalry would join Rawdon, and detached Wayne and Morgan 
either to manocuvTe Tarleton down, or to determine liis course. Upon 
this he retired witli precipitation towards PortsmouUi, where the British 
army is for the present. 

" From every account it appears, that a part of the enemy will cm- 
bark. The light infantry, the guards, the thirtieth regiment, the Queen's 
rangers are, it is said, destined to New York. Of this I have sent ac- 
counts by water to Rhode Island, but question if the boats will arrive. 
My opinion was, that the cavalry would push towards Carolina ; but their 
late movements seem to indicate a different intention. Lord Cornwallis, 
I am told, is much disappointed in his hopes of command. I cannot 
find out what he does with himself. Should he go to England, we are, 
I think, to rejoice at it. He is a bold and active man, two dangerous 
qualities in this southern war." — MS. Letter, Ahhern Hill, Jul;/ Wib. 

What is here said, respecting Lord Comwallis's disappninlmont as to 
his command, is in allusion to his succeeding Sir Henry Clinton, who 
it had been supposed would resign. He had for some time solicited 
his recall. 



120 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mt 49. 

from Virginia to New York will be attended, it is 
more tiian probable, that we shall also entirely change 
our plan of operations. I think we have already ef- 
fected one part of the plan of the campaign settled at 
Weathersfield ; that is, giving a substantial relief to the 
southern States, by obliging the enemy to recall a con- 
siderable part of their force from thence. Our views 
must now be turned towards endeavouring to expel 
them totally from those States, if we find ourselves 
incompetent to the siege of New York. The difficulty 
of doing this does not so much depend upon obtain- 
ing a force capable of eff'ecting it, as upon the mode 
of collecting that force to the proper point, and trans- 
porting the provisions and stores necessary for such 
an operation. You are fully acquainted with the al- 
most impracticability of doing this by land ; to say no- 
thing of the amazing loss of men always occasioned 
by long marches, and those towards a quarter in which 
the service is disagreeable. I should not, however, 
hesitate to encounter these difficulties, great as they 
are, had we not prospects of transporting ourselves in 
a manner safe, easy, and expeditious. Your penetra- 
tion will point out my meaning, which I cannot ven- 
ture to express in direct terms.* 

I approve of your resolution to reinforce General 
Greene, in proportion to the detachment which the 
enemy may make to New York. Let your next at- 
tention be paid to training and forming the militia, with 
which you may be furnished, and disposing of them in 
such a manner, that they may be drawn at the short- 
est notice to whatever point the enemy may make 
their capital post, which I conclude will be at Ports- 
mouth. The establishment of magazines at safe depos-

its will be in all cases necessary ; but, above all things, 
I recommend an aiigmciitatit)ii of your cavalry to 
as great an extent as possible. It may happen, that 
the enemy may be driven to the necessity of forcing 
their way through North Carolina to avoid a greater 
misfortune. A superiority of horse on our side would 
be fatal to them in such a case. 

The advantages resulting from a move of the French 
fleet from Newport to the Chesapeake were cai-ly and 
strongly pointed out to Count de Barras, and I thought 
he had once agreed to put it in execution ; but, by 
his late letters, he seemed to think that such a ma- 
noeuvre might interfere with greater plans, and there- 
fore he declined it. It would now be too late to an- 
swer the principal object, as, by accounts from a de- 
serter, the troops arrived from Virginia last Friday. 

Should your return to this army be fmally deter- 
mined upon, I cannot flatter you with a command 
equal to your expectations or my wishes. You know 
the over proportion of general oflicers to our numbers, 
and can therefore conceive where the difliculty will be. 
General M'^Dougall is not yet provided for, and the 
Jersev anti York troops are reserved for him. They 
are promised to him, though they have not yet joined. 

In my letter to General Greene, which I beg the 
favor of you to forward, I have hinted nothing of 
what I have said to you, for fear of miscarriage. You 
will probably find a safe opportunity from your army 
to him, and you will oblige me by communicating the 
part of this letter, which relates to my expectation of 
being able to transport part of the army to the south- 
ward, should the operation against New York be de- 
clined. 

I wish, as I mentioned in my last, to send a con- 
fidential person to you to explain at large what I

have so distantly hinted ; but I am really at a loss, on 
account of not knowing the olficers better, to find one 
upon whose discretion I can depend. My own family, 
you know, are constantly and fully employed. I hope, 
however, that I have spoken plain enough to be un- 
derstood by you. With every sentiment of affection 
and regard, I am, &,c. 



TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 

Head-Q,uarters, Dobbs's Ferry, 2 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

The expectation of the pleasure of seeing you has 
prevented me hitherto from making a communication 
of a most important and interesting nature. But cir- 
cumstances will not admit of further delay, and I must 
trust it to paper. It seems reduced almost to a cer- 
tainty, that the enemy will reinforce New York with 
part of their troops from Virginia. In that case, the at- 
tempt against the former must be laid aside, as it will 
not be in our power to draw together a force sufficient 
to justify the undertaking. The detachment, which the 
enemy will probably leave in Virginia, seems the next 
object which ought to engage our attention, and which 
will be a very practicable one, should we obtain a naval 
superiority, of which I am not without hopes, and be 
able to carry a body of men suddenly round by water. 
The principal ditficulty, which occurs, is obtaining trans- 
ports at the moment they may be wanted ; for, if they 
are taken up beforehand, the use for which they are 
designed cannot be concealed, and the enemy will 
make arrangements to defeat the plan. 

What I would wish you to inform yourself of, there- 
fore, without making a direct inquiry, is what number 



PahtII.) TIIK AMKKICAN K K V O L U T 1 O N . 123 

of tons of shipping coukl be obtaint'il in PhilatleI[)Iii;i 
at any time between this and the 20th of this month, 
and wliether there could also be obtained at the same 
time a few deep-waisted sloops and schooners proper 
to carr)' horses. The number of double-decked ves- 
sels, which may be wanted, of two huntlred tons and 
upw;u-ds, will not exceed thirty, I shall be glad of 
your answer as soon as possible, because, if it is fa- 
vorable, I can direct certain preparations to be made in 
Philadelphia and at other convenient places, without 
incurring any suspicions. There certainly can be no 
danger of not obtaining flour in Philadelphia ; and as 
you seem to have doubts of procuring salt meat there, 
I shall direct all that is at the eastward to be collected 
at places from whence it may be shipped upon the 
shortest notice. You will also oblige me by giving me 
your opinion of the number of vessels, which might 
be obtained at Baltimore, or other places in the Ches- 
apeake, in the time before mentioned or thereabouts.

TO MESHECH WEARK, PRESIDENT OF 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Mead-Quarters, Dobbs's Ferry, 2 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I regret being obliged to inform your Excellency, 
that I find myself at this late period very litUe stronger 
than I was when the army first moved out of their 
quarters. I leave your Excellency to judge of the 
delicate and embarrassed situation in which I stand at 
this moment. Unable to advance with prudence be- 
yond my present position, while perhaps in the general 
opinion my force is equal to the commencement of 



124 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

operations against New York, my conduct must appear, 
if not Ijlamable, highly mysterious at least. Our allies, 
with whom a junction has been formed upwards of 
three weeks, and who were made to expect, from the 
engagements which I entered into with them at Weath- 
ersfield in May last, a very considerable augmentation 
of our force by this time, instead of seeing a prospect 
of advancing, must conjecture, upon good grounds, that 
the campaign will waste fruitlessly away. I shall just 
remark, that it will be no small degree of triumph to 
our enemies, and will have a very pernicious influence 
upon our fi-iends in Europe, should they find such a 
failure of resource, or such a want of energy to draw 
It out, that our boasted and expensive preparations 
end only in idle parade. 

I cannot yet but persuade myself, and I do not 
cease to encourage our allies with the hope, that our 
force will still be sufficient to carry our intended op- 
eration into efTect ; or, if we cannot fully accomplish 
that, to oblige the enemy to withdraw part of their force 
from the southward to support New York, which, as I 
informed you in my letter from Weathersfield, was part 
of our plan. Your Excellency must be sensible, that 
the fulfilment of my engagements must depend upon 
the degree of vigor, with which the executives of the 
several States exercise the powers with which they 
have been vested, and enforce the laws lately passed 
for filling up and supplying the army. In full confi- 
dence that the means, which have been voted, will be 
obtained, I shall continue my preparations ; but I must 
take the liberty of informing you, that it is essentially 
necessary I should be made acquainted, immediately 
upon the receipt of this, with the number of Continen- 
tal levies and militia, that have been forwarded, and 
what are the prospects of obtaining the remainder. I

TO TlIK I'KKSIUK.NT OF CO.NUUESS. 

Hcad-Quartcrsi, Dobbs's Ferry, 8 August, 1781 

Sin, 

I do myself the honor to inform Congress, through 
your Excellency, that, at a late meeting between the 
American and British commissaries of prisoners, it has 
been proposed by the latter to go into a full exchange 
of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne and all the remaining 
officers of convention (by composition where rank will 
not apply) for the remainder of our oflicers in this 
quarter, and after them for those taken at the south- 
ward. One of the trrnis insisted upon is, that the pris- 
oners surrendered by the capitulation of the Cedars, to 
the amount of four hundred and forty-three, shall be al- 
lowed. 

I have not thought myself at liberty to accede to 
these proposals without the concurrence of Congress, 
for the following reasons ; that I imagine our minister 
at the court of Versailles has been already directed to 
propose the exchange of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne 
for the Honorable Mr. Laurens ; that I do not know 
whether it would be agreeable to Congress to release 
the whole of the convention officers, before they have 
obtained a settlement for the subsistence of those 
troops ; and lastly because the refusal of the ratifica- 
tion of the convention of the Cedars has never been 
repealed. 

• Sent as a circular to each of the eastern States. 



126 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 



I would beg leave to remark on the two last, that 
the exchange of our full colonels can never be obtained 
but by composition, and that it is better to effect this 
by a composidon for inferior officers than for men, be- 
cause the enemy gain no reinforcement by such a mode. 
To relieve the full colonels in this quarter only, who, all 
but one, have been prisoners since 1777, would take 
seven hundred privates. Should the security for the 
convention debt still be urged, I would answer, that we 
may perhaps deceive ourselves in supposing that the 
balance upon a general settlement, for the subsistence 
of all prisoners since the commencement of the war, 
will be much in our favor. I am inclined to think we 
shall find it the contrary, and owing to this, namely, 
that the British have constantly kept their accounts with 
accuracy and have vouchers ready to support them. 
We, on the other hand, shall be found very deficient 
on that score ; indeed, I fear almost totally so, except 
in the instance of the convention troops and prisoners 
of war latterly. 

Congress will judge of the expediency of repeahng 
their act i-especting the convention of the Cedars upon 
the present occasion. Mr. Skinner, the commissary- 
general of prisoners, will have the honor of delivering 
this to your Excellency. I shall be obliged by an an- 
swer to the several points contained in it, at his re- 
turn, that I may instruct him accordingly. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.* 

* There had been some difficulty in regard to the exchange of pri- 
vate individuals, who were taken when not acting in any military or 
public capacity. The following extract from a letter to Mr. Skinner 
will show upon what principles General Washington regarded this de- 
scription of prisoners.

without any compensation. You may inform Mr. Loring, that I would 
not wish to be obliged to seize private persons to obtain the relief of

TO Tin; JIAKQUIS DK LAt'AVKTTK. 

llend-Qimrtcrs, Dobbs's Ferry, 15 Aiijiist, 1781. 

My dkar Makquis, 
I hiive received your letters of the 26th and 30th 
ultimo anil 1st instant. I cannot learn that any troops 
have yet arrived at New York from Virginia. A lleet 
of twenty sail came in last Saturday with troops, but 
they are said to be Hessian recruits from Europe. The 
Concorde frigate has arrived at Newport from Count de 
Gitisse. He was to leave St. Domingo the 3d of this 
month, with a fleet of between twenty- five and twenty- 
nine sail of the line, and a considerable body of land 
forces. His destination is immediately for the Chesa- 
peake ; so that he will either be there by the time this 
reaches you, or you may look for him every moment. 
Under these circumstances, w'hether the enemy remain 
in full force, or whether they have only a detachment 
left, you will immediately take such a position as will 
best enable you to prevent their sudden retreat through 
North Carolina, which I presume they will attempt 
the instant they perceive so formidable an armament. 
Should General Wayne, with the troops destined for 

those who are now in New York. I have it at this time in my power to 
secure every loyalist in the western part of Connecticut, in the county 
of Westchester, and in great part of Bergen ; but I have not encouraged 
a practice, which I have reprobated in the enemy, and which notliing shall 
induce me to put in execution, but seeing no otlicr mode of procuring 
the release of our citizens." — .'higitst 6th. 

On receiving General Washington's letter. Congress resolved, that he 
should be authorized to go into a full exchange of General Burgoyne 
and oil the remaining officers of the convention of Saratoga ; and, also, 
that the prisoners taken at the Cedars should be considered as subjecta 
of exchange, on condition that allowance should be made for several 
Canadian officers taken by the Americans at St. John's and Chamblee, 
and sent into the British lines on parole in J77(), concerning whose ex- 
change tliere had been a dispute. — Journals, .iugust 2lsL

South Carolina, still remain in the neighbourhood of 
James River, and should the enemy have made no de- 
tachment to the southward, you will detain those troops 
until you hear fi'om me again, and inform General 
Greene of the cause of their delay. If Wayne should 
have marched, and should have gained any consider- 
able distance, I would not have him halted. 

You shall hear further from me as soon as I have 
concerted plans and formed dispositions for sending a 
reinforcement from hence. In the mean time, I have 
only to recommend a continuation of that prudence 
and good conduct, which you have manifested through 
the whole of your campaign. You will be particulai-ly 
careful to conceal the expected arrival of the Count; 
because, if the enemy are not apprized of it, they will 
stay on board their transports in the Bay, which will 
be the luckiest circumstance in the world. You will 
take measures for opening a communication with Count 
de Grasse the moment he arrives, and will concert 
measures with him for making the best use of your 
joint forces until you receive aid from this quarter. I 
would not wish you to call out a large body of miU- 
tia upon this occasion, but rather keep those you have 
compact and ready for service. I am, &c.*

Head-Quarters, Dobbs's Ferry, IC August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I have only time to acknowledge the receipt of your 
Hwor of the 8th instant and to coni^ratulate you on 
your fortunate escape ; which is attended with tiie more 
flattering circumstances, from its being efTected entii-ely 
by your own presence of mind.* As the remaining 
part of Colonel Cortlandt's regiment is now ordered to 
join the main army, I have given directions to Gen- 
eral Clinton to leave with you a small guard of men, 
who are the least capable of active service. The com- 
missary will have orders to replace the rum, which you 
have borrowed for the public service, as soon as our 
circumstances will conveniently admit. At present 

river or the bay, the less so as they have made a parade of taking pilots 
on board, I had rather act on tlic cautious side, and by keeping a support- 
ing position leave no chance to his Lordship to out-mantnuvrc us. Should 
a French fleet now come into Hampton Road, the Britisli army would, I 
think, be ours. 

" I am going to send a flag to Lord Comwallis. I owe him the jus-

Comwallis took possession of York and Gloucester on tlie 1st and 2d 
of August, and, having removed with as much expedition as possible 
all his army from Portsmouth, commenced fortifying those posts. 

• There had been intimations communicated to General Schuyler at 
different times, that the enemy were laying plans to seize his person. 
He gave little heed to these rumors at first, but they were pressed upon 
him so confidently, that he thought prudence required some precaution. 
In this he went no farther, however, tlian to avoid exposing himself un- 
necessarily, and to be prepared for any sudden assault upon his house.

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Camp, at Phillipsburg, 17 August, 1781. 

Sir, 

In consequence of the despatches received from your 
Excellency by the frigate Concorde, it has been judged 
expedient to give up for the present the enterprise 
against New York, and turn our attention towards the 
south, with a view, if we should not be able to attempt 
Charleston itself, to recover and secure the States of 
Virginia, North Carolina, and the country of South 
Carolina and Georgia. We may add a further induce- 
ment for giving up the first-mentioned enterprise, which 
is the arrival of a reinforcement of near three thousand 
Hessian recruits. For this purpose we have deter- 
mined to remove the whole of the French army, and 
as large a detachment of the American as can be 
spared, to the Chesapeake, to meet your Excellency 
there. 

The following appear to us the principle cases, which 

were deposited. The enemy's numbers prevailed. They secured two 
of my men, wounded a third, and obliged the other to fly out of the house 
for safety. Some then entered, whilst others surrounded the house. 
Those in the quarter exposed to my fire retired, on the first discharges. 
Those, that had got into the saloon leading to my bed-room, retreated 
Willi great precipitation, on hearing me call, ' Come on, my lads ; surround 
the house, and secure the villains, who are plundering.' I believe this 
little incident saved me ; for, although the townsmen ran with all possible 
celerity to my assistance as soon as tliey heard the firing, yet they came 
too late to overtake the enemy, who carried off the two men and part of 
my plate. Myers, who was wounded, headed the party, which consisted 
of about twenty. General Clinton has ordered me a sergeant's guard."

will present themselves, and upon which we shall be 
obliged ultimately to form our plans. We have there- 
fore stated them with a few short observations upon 
each. Your Excellency will be pleased to revolve 
them in your mind, and prepare your opinion by the 
time we shall have the pleasure of meeting you in 
Virginia. 

First, What shall be done, if the enemy should be 
found with the greater part of their force in Virginia, 
upon the arrival of the French fleet 1 Secondly, What 
shall be done, if a detachment only shall be found 
there? Thirdly, What shall be done, if the British 
force be totally withdrawn from thence? 

As to the first, it appears to us, that we ought, with- 
out loss of time, to attack the enemy with our united 
force. 

As to the second, it appears proper to destine such 
part of our force as will be amply sudicient to reduce 
the enemy's detachment, and then determine what use 
shall be made of the remainder. And here two things 
present themselves for our consideration. The enemy 
will either have sent the greater part of their force from 
Virginia to New York or to Charleston. If to New 
York, (which is the least probable under present cir- 
cumstances,) Charleston will have but a moderate gar- 
rison, and it may be possible to attack it to advantage. 
If to Charleston, then the enemy will be so superior to 
General Greene, that they will be able to regain the 
whole of the State of South Carolina, and of conse- 
quence Georgia. We therefore think, that, in this latter 
case, such a force at least should be detached to South 
Carolina, as will enable us to keep the field and con- 
fine the enemy in or near Charieston. 

In the third case we mean, that, supposing the enemy 
should have totally evacuated Virginia, it appears to us 



132 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

necessary to make a solid establishment at Portsmouth, 
or any other place if more proper, in order to render 
a fleet in the Chesapeake Bay entirely secure, and to 
employ the remainder of our land force and such ves- 
sels as may be proper for the service, as has been ex- 
plained in the preceding article ; that is, either in the 
siege of Charleston, if the garrison shall be found suf- 
ficient to warrant the attempt, or to cover and secure 
the country, should it be found otherwise. 

Returning to the enterprise against New York will 
depend on a number of circumstances, the discussion 
of which we will leave until we have the happiness of 
a conference with your Excellency. We have only to 
observe, that the execution of all or any of the plans, 
which we have proposed, goes upon the supposition of a 
decided naval superiority; except that of marching a 
reinforcement into South Carolina. 

We would beg leave to take up so much of your 
time, as to point out to you the vast importance of 
Charleston, and what advantages the enemy derive from 
the possession of it. It is the centre of their power in 
the south. By holding it they preserve a dangerous in- 
fluence throughout the whole State, as it is the only 
port, and the only place from whence the people can 
procure those articles of foreign produce, which are es- 
sential to their support ; and it in a great measure 
serves to cover and keep in sui)jection the State of 
Georgia. From thence the enemy can also establish 
small posts in North Carolina ; and, if they maintain a 
post in the Chesapeake, they keep up the appearance 
of possessing four hundred miles upon the coast, and 
of consequence have a pretext for setting up claims, 
which may be very detrimental to the interests ot 
America in European councils. 

We are not sufficiently acquainted with the position

enter into a tielail of the proper mode of attacluiig ii, 
or of the probability wliich ue should have of succeed-

Duportail, commander of the corps of engineers in the 
service of the United Slates, who will have the honor 
of presenting this. That gentleman, having been in 
Charleston as principal engineer during the greater part 
of the siege, and in the environs of it as a prisoner of 
war a considerable time afterwards, had opportunities 
of making very full observations, which he judiciously 
improved. 

A variety of cases, different from those we have 
stated, may occur. It is for this reason we have 
thought proper to send General Duportail to your Ex- 
cellency. He is fully acquainted with every circum- 
stance of our affairs in this quarter, and we recom- 
mend him to you as an officer, in whose abilities and 
in w hose integrity you may place the fullest confi- 
dence. We would observe, that it will lie very es- 
sential to the despatch of the business in contempla- 
tion, for you to send up the Elk River, at the head of 
the Chesapeake Bay, all your frigates, transports, and 
vessels proper for the conveyance of the French and 
American troops down the bay. We shall endeavour 
to have as many as can be found in Baltimore and 
other ports secured, but we have reason to believe 
they will be very few. We have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, attachment, esteem, &,c.*

Rochambeau. It will have been seen by the preceding letters, that the 
thoughts of General Washington had for several days been tnrned to-

the arrival of the reinforcement of Hessians in that city on the 11th had 
added still stronger motives for this change of plan. After receiving in-

TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE, 

Ilead-Quarters, Dobbs's Ferry, 17 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I have in confidence imparted to you the aUeration 
of our late plan, and made you acquainted with our in- 
tended operations. Besides the provision necessary at 
the Head of Elk to carry the troops down the bay, a 
very considerable quantity will be wanted in Virginia. 
I should suppose three hundred barrels of flour, as 

to the Chesapeake, no time was lost in determining wliat co\irse to pur- 
sue. The news came from Count de Barras. 

Diary, July 14M. — " Received despatches from the Count de Barras, 
announcing the intended departure of Coimt de Grasse from Cape Fran- 
cois with between twenty-five and twenty-nine sail of the line, and three 
thousand two hundred land troops, on the 3d instant, for the Cliesapeake 
Bay ; and the anxiety of the latter to have every tiling in the most per- 
fect readiness to commence our operations at the moment of liis arrival, 
as he should be under the necessity, from particular engagements with 
the Spaniards, to be in the West Indies by the middle of October. The 
Count de Barras at the same time intimated his intentions of an enter- 
prise against Newfoundland ; in opposition to which both Count de Ro- 
chambeau and myself remonstrated, as being impolitic and dangerous un- 
der the probability of Rodney's coming on this coast. 

" Matters having now come to a crisis, and a decided plan to be de- 
termined on, I was obliged, — from the shortness of Count de Grasse's 
promised stay on this coast, the apparent disinclination of their naval of- 
ficers to force the harbour of New York, and the feeble compliance of 
the States with my requisitions for men hitherto, and the little prospect 
of greater exertion in future, — to give up all ideas of attacking New 
York, and instead thereof to remove the French troops and a detachment 
from the American army to the Head of Elk, to be transported to Vir- 
ginia for the purpose of cooperating with the force from the West Indies 
against the troops in that State." 

In the letter, which accompanied the despatches above mentioned, 
Count de Barras said, tliat Count de Grasse did not require him to form a 
junction witli the West India squadron, but left him at liberty to under- 
take any other enterprise, which he might think proper. In conformity 
with this permission, and with the spirit of the original but contingent in- 
structions from the ministers, he proposed an expedition to Newfoundland, 
and said he should wish to take with him the land forces, that had been 
left at Newport under M. de Choisy. This step was strongly disapproved

many of salt meat, and ci2;ht or ten lioj^jslieacls of rum 
would be sutliciont at Elk. For what will be con- 
sumed in Virginia, I imagine the order must be gen- 
eral, as wc can neither ascertain the number of men, 
who will he drawn together, or the time they will be 
employed. 

I have written to the Count de Grasse, and have re- 
quested him to send up his light vessels of every kind 
to Elk ; but I wouKl nevertheless wish to have all that 
may be at Baltimore and the upper parts of the bay 
secured. I shall therefore be obliged to you to take 
measures at a proper time for that purpose. When 

by both General Washington and Count de Roclianibcati ; and, as soon as 
he received tlieir remonstrance against it, Count de Barras resolved to 
proceed to the Chesapeake. 

It is probable, likewise, that some degree of personal feeling had its in- 
fluence on llie wishes of Count de Barras. In the council of war, which 
was held some time before respecting the removal of the fleet to Boston, 
after a debate indicating a little warmth among the ofEcers, Count de 
Rocliambeau represents M. de Barras as using the following language. 
"No person is more interested than I am in the arrival of M. de Grasse 
in tliese seas. He was my junior; he has just been appointed lieutenant- 
general. At the moment his approach is made known, I shall set sail to 
put myself under his orders. I will finish this campaign ; I will never 
make another." — Manoirea de Rochambeau, Tom. I. p. 276. Hence it 
appears, that the two naval commanders stood in a delicate relation to 
each other ; and it may be presumed, that this was the reason why Count 
de Grasse left Count de Barras at liberty to join him or not, as he should 
be inclined ; and also why the latter preferred a separate enterprise. 

The same anecdote is mentioned by M. Souli'-s ( Histoire de.i Troubles 
de l\hnerii]ue .■Inglaise, Tom. IH. p. .372), whoso work on the American 
revolution is the best written and most authentic in the French language. 
The author had access to public documents in the department of war ; 
but all the particulars relating to the operations of Rochambeau's army 
are taken almost wor<l for word from a narrative, which had been drawn up 
by Count de Rochambeau, and which was afterwards published as a part 
of his Mimoirts. A large portion of M. SouUs' book was read in manu- 
script by Count de Rocliambeau, and also by the minister of war ; and, 
although tliis process might contribute to its accuracy, yet it would hardly 
leave unshackled tlic autlior's independence and judgment.

that time will be, and when you shall give orders for 
the deposit at Elk, I will hereafter inform you. I shall 
du'ect the quartermaster in due season to take up all 
the small craft in the Delaware for the purpose of 
transporting the troops from Trenton to Christiana. 
Should he have occasion for advice or assistance from 
you upon this occasion, I must request you to give 
him both. I am confident it will be necessary to give 
the American troops, destined for southern services, 
one month's pay in specie. This will amount to about 
dollars. If it will be possible for you to pro- 
cure this sum, you will infinitely oblige me and will 
much benefit the service. I shall also stand in need 
of a sum of specie for secret services, I suppose about 
five hundred guineas. I am, dear Sir, &c.* 



TO JIAJOR-GEJfERAL HEATH. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

You are to take the command of all the troops re- 
maining in this department, consisting of the two regi- 
ments of New Hampshire, ten of Massachusetts, and 
five of Connecticut infantry, the corps of invalids, Shel- 
don's legion, the third regiment of artillery, together 
with all such State troops and militia, as are retained 
in service, and who would have been under my own 
command. 

The security of West Point and the posts in the 
Highlands is to be considered the first object of your 
attention. In order to effect this, you will make such

tlispositions as in your juclnmont the circumstances shall 
Iroin time to time require ; taking care to have as large 
a supply of salted provisions as possible constantly on 
hiuul ; to have the fortifications, works, and magazines 
re|)aired and j)erfected as far as may l)e ; to have the 
garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present 
strength ; and to have the minuter arrangements and 
plans for the defence and support of this important post 
perfectly understood and vigorously acted upon, in case 
of any attempt against it. Am})le magazines of wood 
and forage are to be laid in against the approaching 
winter. The former should be cut on the margin of 
the river, and transported by water to the garrison. 
The latter ought to be collected from the country be- 
low the lines, in the greatest quantities possible, and 
deposited in such places as you shall judge proper. 

The force now put under your orders, it is presumed, 
will be sullicient for all the purposes above mentioned ; 
as well as to yield a very considerable protection and 
cover to the country, without hazarding the safety of 
the posts in the Highlands. This is to be esteemed, 
as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of 
the country, an extremely interesting object ; but, when 
compared with the former, of a secondary nature. The 
protection of the northern and western frontiers of the 
State of New York, as well as those parts of that and 
other States most contiguous and exposed to the rav- 
ages and depredations of the enemy, will claim your 
attention. But, as the contingencies, which are to be 
expected in the course of the campaign, may be so 
various, unforeseen, and almost infinite, that no particu- 
lar line of conduct can be prescribed for them, upon 
all such occasions you will be governed by your own 
prudence and discretion, in which the fullest confidence 
is placed.

138 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

Although your general rule of conduct will be to act 
on the defensive only, yet it is not meant to prohibit 
you from striking a blow at the enemy's posts, or de- 
tachments, should a fair opportunity present itself. 

The most eligible position for your army, in my opin- 
ion, will be on the north side of Croton River ; as 
well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of West 
Point, annoying the enemy, and covering the country, 
as for the security and repose of your troops, Water- 
bury's brigade, which may be posted towards the 
Sound, Sheldon's corps, the State troops of New York, 
and other light parties, may occasionally be made use 
of to hold the enemy in check, and carry on a petite 
guerre with them ; but I would recommend keeping 
your force as much collected and as compact as the 
nature of the service will admit, doing duty by corps 
instead of detachments whenever it is practicable, and 
above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assidu- 
ously, while the troops are in a camp of repose, to 
make them perfect in their exercise and manoeuvres, 
and to establish the most regular system of discipline 
and duty. The good of the service and the emulation 
of corps will, I am persuaded, prompt the officers and 
men to devote their whole time and attention to the 
pleasing and honorable task of becoming masters of 
their profession. The uncertainty, which the present 
movements of the army will probably occasion with the 
enemy, ought to be increased by every means in your 
power, and the deception kept up as long as possible. 

It will not be expedient to prevent such militia as 
were ordered from coming in, until the arrival of the 
Count de Grasse, or something definite or certain is 
known from the southward ; and even then (but of 
this you will be advised) circumstances may render it 
advisable to keep the enemy at New York in check,

to prevent their detaching to reinforce their southern 
aj-niy, or to harass the inhabitants on tiie seacoast. 

The redoubt on the east side of Dobbs's Ferry is to 
be dismantled and demolished, and the platforms to be 
taken up and transported up the river, if it can con- 
veniently be done. The blockhouse on the other side 
is to be maintained, or evacuated and destroyed, as you 
shall think proper. The water-guards and other pre- 
cautions to prevent a surprise, you will be pleased to 
take into consideration, and regulate in such a manner 
as you shall judge most expedient. You will be pleas- 
ed, also, to keep me regularly advised of every impor- 
tant event, which shall take place in your department.

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

King's Ferry, 21 August, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have this moment the honor of your letter by Mon- 
sieur Blanchard. I am very sorry for the difiiculties 
and impediments, which fall in the way of your march, 
and hope they will decrease as you proceed. I have 
the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that my troops 
arrived at the Ferry yesterday, and began to pass the 
river at ten o'clock in the morning, and by sunrise of 
this day they were all completely on this side of the 
river. I hope your army will be enabled to cross with 
the same facility when they arrive. 

I have no news worthy of communicating from any 
quarter. I shall be happy in your company to-morrow 
at dinner at my quarters, and will meet you at the 
ferry to-morrow by eight o'clock, when we will either

take you to my quarters about three miles from the 
Ferry, where you shall be introduced to a warm break- 
fast. I have the honor to be, &c.*

My dear Marquis, 

Agreeably to my intentions communicated to you on 
the 15th instant, the troops destined for the southern 
quarter are now in motion. The American detachment 
is already on the west side of the Hudson. The French 
army I expect will reach the Ferry this day. Our 
march will be continued with all the despatch that 
our circumstances will admit. As it will be of great 



* The American army passed from their encampment along the road 
near the river to King's Ferry, and crossed to Stony Point on the 21st. 
The French army marched by the way of White Plains, North Castle, 
Pine's Bridge, and Crompond, and crossed the river with all their bag- 
gage and stores between the 22d and 25th. The two armies pursued 
their march to Trenton by different routes ; one column passing through 
Chatham, Springfield, and Brunswick, for the purpose of keeping up as 
long as possible an appearance of threatening Staten Island, or of march- 
ing" round to Sandy Hook to facilitate the entrance of the French fleet 
into the harbour. A French bakery was also established at Chatham, as 
a blind to the enemy, which should strengthen the opinion that opera- 
tions were intended in that quarter. General Washington remained with 
the army till the 30th, when he and Count de Rochambeau set off for 
Philadelphia, and arrived there the next day. He immediately applied 
himself to provide vessels, and other means of transporting the army, 
baggage, and stores from Trenton to the Head of Elk. So few vessels 
could be found, that one regiment only went by water, with the stores, 
down the Delaware and up Christiana Creek. All the remaining troops 
marched by land, and passed through Philadelphia. General Lincoln had 
the immediate command of the army in its progress southward. 

An extract from Mr. Morris's Diary, containing an animated account 
of General Washington's reception in Philadelphia on this occasion, may-

importance towiu'ds tlic success of our present enter- 
prise, that tlie enemy on the arrival of the fleet should 
not have it in tiieir power to effect their retreat, I can- 
not omit to repeat to you my most earnest wish, tliat 
the land and naval forces, which you will have with 
you, may so combine their operations, that the British 
army may not be able to escape. The particular mode 
of doing this I shall not at this distance attempt to 
dictate. Your own knowledge of the country, from 
your long continuance in it, and the various and ex- 
tended movements, which you have made, have given 
you great opportunities for observation ; of w hich I 
am persuaded your military genius and judgment will 
leail you to make the best improvement. You will, 
my dear Marquis, keep me constantly advised of ev- 
ery important event respecting the enemy or yourself.

the troops who will be there by that day.* 

• When Cornwallis had retired before Lafayette, and was near VVil- 
liamsbiirfr, as the former had a superior force, Lafayette did not choose 
to bring him to a general action ; but he wished at the same time to im- 
press upon him an idea of tlie largeness of his numbers, in order that 
Cornwallis might not be induced to turn upon him, and thus compel him 
again to retreat He had taken into his ser%'ice a very shrewd negro 
man, whom he had instructed to go into the enemy's camp and pretend 
to give himself up to them. This task the man performed with so much 
cunning, that he was actually employed by Lord Cornwallis as a spy, at 
the time he was acting in the same capacity for the other side. But he 
was true to his first employer. Lafayette wrote a fictitious order to Gen- 
eral Morgan, requiring him to take his station at a certain po.st in con- 
junction with tlic army. The paper was then torn and given to the negro, 



142 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t.49. 



King's Ferry, 21 August, 1781. 

Gentlemen, 

I have devoted the first moment of my time, wliich 
I could command (while the troops are halted for the 
French army at this place), to give my sentiments un- 
reservedly on the several matters contained in your fa- 
vor of the 13th instant. This I will attempt to do 
with all that frankness and sincerity, which, from your 
candor in your communications, you have a right to ex- 
pect, and for doing which with the greater freedom the 
importance of the subject will be my apology. Per- 
suaded that we are influenced by the same motives, 
and anxious in pursuit of the same object, I am only 
unhappy, that I should be forced to dissent in a single 
instance from the opinion of those, for whose judgment 
and ability I have the highest deference, respecting the 
surest and best mode for attaining that object. 

But, being at the same time fully sensible of the ne- 

with directions how to proceed. He returned to Cornwallis, who asked 
him what news he brought from the American camp. He said there was 
no news, that he saw no changes, but every thing appeared as it was the 
day before. Holding the tattered paper in his hand, he was asked what 
it was, and replied that he had picked it up in the American camp, but, as 
he could not read, he did not know that it was of any importance. The 
General took it, and was surprised to find such an order. He had not 
lieard of Morgan's having joined the army, or of his being expected. It 
made him cautious, however, for a day or two before he was undeceived, 
and the object of Lafayette was gained. 

* Mr. Morris, as superintendent of finance, and Mr. Peters, as a mem- 
ber of the Board of War, had been appointed commissioners by Con- 
gress to proceed to head-quarters, and consult the Commander-in-chief 
respecting the arrangement and numbers of the army for the ensuing 
year. — Journals, July 31 s(. They had recently been in the camp for 
that purpose, and had addressed a letter to General Washington con- 
taining several queries on that subject. See the letter in tlie Diplo- 
matic Correspondence, Vol. XI. p. 426. The basis of their scheme was 
a reduction of the army.

cessity of prosecuting the wiu- witli as much vigor as 
our circumstances will ailmit, and of using tlie strictest 
economy in the prosecution ol" it; upon these very prin- 
ciples, I beg leave to give it as my opinion, that a re- 
duction of the number of ollicers and men as fixed by 
the last arrangement, or any material alteration of the 
establishment of the army for the next campaign, uoukl 
not in the present situation of alTairs be expedient, lor 
the following reasons. 

In the iirst place, because the enemy must resolve to 
prosecute the war, or be disposed to make a peace ; in 
either of which cases, a respectable army in the field 
on our part will, I conceive, more than compensate the 
expenses of it, and will eventually he tlie best and 
most economical system of policy we can possibly act 
upon. For, should the enemy still be determined to 
carry on the war with obstinacy, not only policy, but 
even necessity, would urge us to keep up a superior 
army, as the surest and only means of forcing them to 
a peace, and freeing us from the calamities and ex- 
penses of the war ; as it is evident from many circum- 
stances, that they have relied more for success on our 
want of exertions, than upon their own military prow- 
ess or resources, and that this has been one principal 
inducement of their persevering hitherto. But, on the 
other hand, should they be inclined to a pacification, 
a powerful and well appointed army would both ena- 
ble u> to dictate our own terms at the negotiation, and 
hasten the completion of it. 

In addition to this, whoever considers how much 
more expensive and less serviceable militia are than 
Continental troops, how heavy and repeated a burden 
on the public their bounties are, when they are hired ; 
when drafted, how dis;\greeable and fretiuenlly distress- 
ing for them to be torn fi-om their families to a life with 



144 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt. iO. 

which they are totally unacquainted ; how precarious and 
uncertain the aid is, which may be expected from them 
hi such cases ; what glorious opportunities have been 
lost by us, and what almost ruinous advantages have 
been taken by the enemy in times of our weakness, 
for want of a permanent force in the field, — will, I am 
persuaded, be convinced, that we ought to have con- 
stantly such an army as is sufficient to operate against 
the enemy, and supersede the necessity of calling forth 
the militia except on the most extraordinary occasions. 
I will also beg leave to remind you. Gentlemen, of the 
great reduction of the number of regiments on the 
Continental establishment, namely, from one hundred 
and sixteen to fifty since the year 1777, and to observe, 
in consequence, that, in my opinion, we do not find the 
enemy so much exhausted, or their strength so debili- 
tated, as to warrant any farther diminution of our estab- 
lished force. By one of the late intercepted letters 
from Lord George Germain, it appears the enemy con- 
sidered the number of men, in their provincial corps 
only, greater than the whole number of men in the ser- 
vice of the continent. Since which time the reinforce- 
ments that have arrived from Europe amount, by the 
best accounts I have been able to obtain, to at least 
four thousand men. 

That the States are able, by proper exertions, to fur- 
nish the number of men required by the last arrange- 
ment of the army, may I think rationally be supposed ; 
as the population in many of them has rather increased 
than diminished since the commencement of the war; 
and as the greater part of them do actually, when 
called upon in an emergency, give a sufficient number 
of men for services of short duration to complete their 
Continental regiments. That the country abounds with 
supplies of all kinds is acknowledged from all quarters. 



Pa ml I.) rUH AMERICAN REVOLUTION. •'!■'> 

Whctlier the men can be ohtainoil, or the resources 
drawn forth, is more ihim I will picsume with certainty 
to determine ; but one thing is certain, that it is idle 
to contend against great odds, when we have it in our 
power to do it upon equal or even advantageous terms. 

There arc also several arguments, wiiich I omit to 
enforce, tliat might be ailduced particularly to prove 
the impropriety of reducing the number of oilicers, or 
making any considerable alteration in the system ; 
such as our having found by experience, that the 
proportion of oilicers is not too great for the number 
of men ; that liic same or a gi'eater proportion has 
been esteemed necessary in other more ancient ser- 
vices ; and that the full complement is more indispensa- 
bly requisite in ours, because there is a larger number 
of levies and recruits to train and discipline annuiJly, 
than is to be found in the regiments of other nations ; 
and because a greater number of otlicers is taken from 
the line to perform the duties of the stall", than in 
most other services. It is likewise an established fact, 
that every alteration in the military system, or change 
in the arrangement, unless founded in the most obvi- 
ous principles of utility, is attended with uneasiness 
among the oilicers, confusion with regard to the dispo- 
sition of the men, and frequently with irregularities 
and disagreeable consequences before it is carried 
completely into execution. Perfect order throughout 
the whole army has but just been restored since the 
last arrangement took place. Another innovation in 
the present situation might be more mischievous in its 
effects. 

Thus I have, Gentlemen, from a desire of faithfully 
performing my duty, from the experience (of whatever 
degree it is) which I have acquired in the service of 
my countrv, and from the knowledge I have of the

present state of the ai-my, given my sentiments on the 
first of your queries, which likewise involves the an- 
swer to the second. With regard to the third, I am 
of opinion, that the recruits ought if possible to be 
engaged for the war, or three years ; but, if this cannot 
be done, that the community, district, or class, furnish- 
ing a man for a shorter term of service, ought to be 
compellable to have him replaced by the period when 
his time of service expires ; and that funds ought to 
be established, if practicable, for recruiting the men 
engaged for short services, while they continue with 
the army, as it is found by experience that they may 
be enlisted with more facility and less expense, than 
under any other circumstances. With respect to the 
fourth, fifth, and sixth queries, I am in doubt whether 
any alteration can be made on those subjects, which 
shall tend essentially, all things considered, to the 
public good. I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING HIS BRITANNIC 
majesty's ships of war at new YORK. 

Head-Quarters, 21 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
The almost daily complaints of the severities ex- 
ercised towards the American marine prisoners in New 
York, have induced the Honorable the Congress of the 
United States to direct me to remonstrate to the 
commanding officer of his Britannic Majesty's ships of 
war in that harbour upon the subject, and to report 
to them his answer. The principal complaint now is, 
the inadequacy of the room in the prison -ships to the 
number of prisoners confined on board of them, which 
causes the death of many, and is the occasion of 



Part II.] VUi: A M i: R 1 CA .N 11 K V O L U Tl 0.\. 117 

most intolerable inconveniences and distresses to those 
wliu siirvi\e. Tliis line of conduct is the more aggra- 
vating, as the want of a greater number of prison- 
ships, or of sullicient room on shore, cannot be pleaded 
in excuse. 

As a bare denial of what has been asserted by 
so many individuals, who have unfortunately expe- 
rienced the miseries I have mentioned, will not be 
satisfactory, I have to propose, that our commissary- 
general of prisoners, or any other oflicer, who shall 
be agreed upon, shall have liberty to visit the ships, 
inspect the situation of the prisoners, and make a re- 
port, from an exact survey of the situation in which 
they may be found, whether, in his opinion, there 
has been any just cause of complaint. I shall be 
glad to be favored with an answer as soon as con- 
venient. I h;ne the honor to be, &,c.* 



TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Head-Quarters, King's Ferry, 24 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I take the earhest opportunity to inform your Ex- 
cellency, that, by a letter which the Count tie Ro- 
chambeau has received from Newport, the Count de 
Barras has taken a resolution to join your fleet in the 
Chesapeake ; for which purpose he intended, if the 
winds should prove favorable, to depart from New- 
port on the 21st instant. This information is com- 
municated to your Excellency, that you mav take 
such measures as you shall think proper to facilitate 
the intended junction. 

• See the answer in the .Appendix, No. V.

From tlie progress already made in our march 
towards the Chesapeake, it is estimated that the troops 
may arrive at the Head of Elk by the 8th of Sep- 
tember. That no delay may retard our embarkation, 
I take the liberty again to urge the necessity of your 
Excellency's sending up all your frigates and trans- 
ports to the Head of Elk, in such time, that they 
may be sure of being there by the 8th of next month. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 
/ 

Ciiatham, 27 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
Accounts brought by several vessels to Philadelphia 
and to the eastward leave little doubt, that the Count 
de Grasse must have already arrived in the Chesa- 
peake, or that he must be very soon there. The 
Count de Rochambeau and myself have therefore 
determined that no time ought to be lost in mak- 
ing preparations for our transportation from Trenton 
to Christiana, and from the Head of Elk down the 
Chesapeake. I have wTitten by this opportunity to 
Colonel Miles, and have directed him immediately to 
engage all the proper kind of craft for the navigation 
of the Delaware, which can be found in Philadelphia 
or in the creeks above and below it ; and, as your advice 
may be useful to him, more especially so far as re- 
spects procuring the vessels at a distance from Phila- 
delphia, I have desired him to wait upon you for that 
purpose. I shall also be obliged to you for using your 
influence with the gentlemen of Baltimore, to permit 
any vessels that may be in that port to come up to 
Elk and assist us in transportation. I have little doubt,

Ironi tlie cheerfulness with which they fiirnislietl the 
jManiuis last winter, that they will comply with yoiu* 
requisition on the present occasion. But, lest there 
shoulil b(! a necessity for the interference of the ex- 
ecutive of the State, I have written to Governor Lee 
upon that and other matters. I enclose the letter 
under a Hying seal for your information, and you will be 
good enough to forward it i)y a ciiain of expresses 
which is established. Any vessels, which may be pro- 
cured in the Chesapeake, should rendezvous as soon 
as possible in Elk River. 

You will be pleased to make the deposit of flour, rum, 
and salt meat at the Head of Elk, which I requested 
in a former letter. I am very fearful that about fifteen 
hundred barrels of salt provisions, and thirty hogs- 
heads of rum, which I directed to be sent from Con- 
necticiit and Rhode Island under convoy of the Count 
de Barras, would not have been ready when the fleet 
sailed from iS'ewport. Should that have been the 
case, the disappointment will be great. I would wish 
you to see whether a like quantity of those articles 
can be procured in Philadelphia or in Maryland, if we 
should find that they have not gone round from the 
eastward. 

I must entreat you, if possible, to procure one 
month's pay in specie for the detachment, which I 
have under my command. Part of those troops have 
not been paid any thing for a long time past, and have 
upon several occasions shown marks of great discon- 
tent. The service they are going upon is disagreeable 
to the northern regiments ; but I malce no doubt that 
a douceur of a little hard money would put them in 
proper temper. If the whole sum cannot be obtained, 
a part of it will be better than none, as it may be 
distributed in proportion to the respective wants and

claims of the men. The American detachment will 
assemble in this neighbourhood to-day ; the French 
army to-morrow. I have the honor to be, &c.* 



TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Pliikflelphia, 2 September, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 
Nothing could have afforded me more satisfaction 
than the information, communicated in your two let- 
ters of the 21st and 24th ultimo, of the measures 
you had taken, and the arrangements you were mak- 
ing, in consequence of the intelligence I had given 
you. Calculating upon the regular force under your 
immediate orders, the militia who have already been 
called for, and may be expected in the field, the 
French army, and the American corps now marching 
with Major-General Lincoln from the northward, in 
addition to the land forces expected on board of the 
fleet, I flatter myself we shall not experience any 
considerable difliculties from the want of men to carry 
our most favorite projects into execution. The means 
for prosecuting a siege with rapidity, energy, and suc- 
cess, and for supplying the troops while they are 
engaged in that service, as they are most precarious, 
have been and still continue to be the great objects of 
my concern and attention. 

* The pressure for money to pay the troops was in part relieved by 
a loan of twenty thousand hard dollars from Count de Rochambeau, 
which Mr. Morris engaged to replace by the 1st of October. — Diplo- 
matic Correspondence, Vol. XI. p. 463. Colonel Laurens arrived in Bos- 
ton from his mission to France on the 25th of August, bringing with 
him in cash two millions and a half of livres, being part of the donation 
of six millions, which had recently been given to the United States by 
the King of France. This was a seasonable supply, and enabled the 
superintendent of finance to fulfil his engagement. See Appendix, 
No. VI. 



I'AKi II.] Tim AMKRICAN REVOLUTION. l^l 

Heavy cannon, ordnance stores, anil aniniunilion, to 
a pretty large amount, are now t'orwariling. General 
Knox, in whose iinmediate province these arrange- 
ments are, and who knows the whole of our resources, is 
making every exertion to Furnish a competent supply, 
aiul will he on the spot to remedy every deficiency, 
as far as the circumstances will possibly admit. Ilav- 
inii also from the first moment been extremely anxious 
respecting the supplies of the army, (in which I com- 
prehend not only provisions of the bread and meat 
kind, but also forage and the means of transportation,) 
I hail written pressingly to the governors of Maryland 
and Virginia on that subject previous to the receipt 
of your favor of the 21st of August. I have since 
reiterated my entreaties, and enforced, in the strongest 
terms I was capable of using, the requisitions for spe- 
cific supplies made by Congress, and now again called 
for by the superintendent of finance from tlie states of 
Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland ; and, as to the sup- 
plies of Pennsylvania, we are to look for them from 
the financier himself. 1 hope and trust the efforts of 
these States and of Virginia will be uncommonly great, 
and proportionate to the magnitude of the object be- 
fore us. 

In order to introduce some kind of system and 
method in our supplies, to know with certainty what 
may be depended upon, and to put the business in 
the best possible train of execution, I shall send for- 
w^ard the heads of departments, as soon as their pres- 
ence can be dispensed with. I have spoken to the 
surgeon-general respecting hospital stores and medi- 
cines. All that can be done will be done in that 
department. As to clothing I am sorry to inform you, 
that litde is to be expected, except in the article of 
shoes, of which a full supply will be sent on. 



152 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

In my progi-ess to the southward, I shall take care, 
as far as practicable, to make all the arrangements 
necessary for the operation in view, and to impress the 
executives with an idea of the absolute necessity of 
furnishing their quotas of supplies regularly ; as we 
have no other resources to rely upon for the support 
of the army, and especially, as I am very apprehensive, 
that a quantity of fifteen hundred barrels of salted 
provisions, which I had ordered to be shipped under 
convoy of the Count de Barras, did not arrive m time 
for that purpose. 

But, my dear Marquis, I am distressed beyond 
measure to know what has become of the Count de 
Grasse, and for fear that the English fleet, by oc- 
cupying the Chesapeake, towards which my last ac- 
counts say they were steering, may frustrate all our 
flattering prospects in that quarter. I am also not a 
little solicitous for the Count de Barras, who was to 
have sailed from Rhode Island on the 23d ultimo, and 
from whom I have heard nothing since that time. Of 
many contingencies we will hope for the most pro- 
pitious events. Should the retreat of Lord Cornwallis 
by water be cut olT, by the arrival of either of the 
French fleets, I am persuaded you will do all in your 
power to prevent "his escape by land. May that great 
felicity be reserved for you.* 

* This felicity it was his good fortune to realize. The British com- 
mander sought for an opportunity to escape into North Carolina, but 
the address and vigilance of Lafayette disconcerted all his schemes. 
After Cornwallis had arrived at York, and commenced his fortifications, 
Lafayette asked Colonel Barber if he knew of a trusty, capable soldier, 
whom he could send as a spy into Cornwallis's camp. He answered 
that there was one in the New Jersey line by tlie name of Morgan, 
who was in all respects suited to such an enterprise. The general 
sent for him, and told him tliat he had a very difficult task to propose 
to him, which was, that he should pretend to desert, go over to the 
British camp, and enlist as a soldier. Morgan answered, that he was

You see how critically important the present mo- 
ment is. For my own part, I am cleterniineil still to 
persist, with unremitting ardor, in my present plan, 
unless some inevitable ami insuperable obstacles urc 
thrown in the way. Adirii. 1 am, &,e. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Chester, 3 o'clock, P. M., 5 September, 1781. 

Sir, 
With pleasure I do myself the honor to transmit 
to your Excellency the enclosed copy ol" a letter Irom 



ready to do any tiling in tlio service of his country, and to oblige hia 
general, but that his feelings revolted at such a proposal. He must 
assume the character of a spy, and, if detected, he would not only 
lose his life, but bring a lasting disgrace upon his name. He desired 
the reputation of a good soldier, and a zealous, true lover of his coun- 
try, but he could not endure the thoughts of being a spy. After some 
conversation, however, he told the general that he would go, on one 
condition, which was, that, in case any disaster should happen to him, 
the general should make the true state of the case known, and have 
the particulars published in tlie New Jersey gazettes, that no re- 
proach might come upon his family and friends for his supposed mis- 
conduct To this tlie general assented. 

Morgan joined the British camp and enlisted. Lafayette left every 
thing to his discretion, but told him that he wished intelligence of im- 
portant movements, and moreover desired the impression particularly to 
be given, that ho had boats enough to transport all his army across 
James River. Morgan had been a little time in camp, when Lord Corn- 
wallis sent for him and asked him many questions. Tarleton was with 
him at the time, and inquired of Morgan among other things how many 
boats General Lafayette had on the river. He said he did not know 
tlie e.\act number, but he had been told tliere were enough to carry over 
all the army at a moment's warning. " There ! " exclaimed Cornwallis 
to Tarleton, " I told you this would not do ; " from which it appeared, 
that tliey had this project in view. 

The French fleet in the mean time arrived. General Lafayette had 
been out to reconnoitre, and when he returned he found si.\ men in the 
British uniform and one green-coated Hessian at his quarters ; and among 
them was .Morgan. " Well, Morgan," asked the general, with surprise,

General Gist. It announces the safe arrival in the 
Chesapeake of Admu-al de Grasse with twenty-eight 
ships of the line. On this happy event I beg your 
Excellency to accept my warmest congratulations. I 
shall proceed, with all possible despatch, forwarding 
as I go the troops and stores, with all the expedition 
in my power. On my arrival at the Head of Elk, if 
I do not find water-craft sufficient to embark the 
whole of the stores and troops, I shall forward on the 
former by water, with as many troops as can go by that 
conveyance, and march the others by land. 

I have the honor to be, &c.* 



" whom have you got here ? " " Five British soldiers, who have deserted 
with me, and a Hessian whom we captured at the out-post," was his re- 
ply. He went on to say, that, as the French fleet had arrived, and he 
presumed his services could no longer bo of any use to liis general in 
the British camp, he had returned, and these deserters and this prisoner 
were the fruits of his expedition. 

The general sent for Morgan tlie next day, and told him that liis con- 
duct had been in the highest degree meritorious, and that he proposed to 
make liim a sergeant. Morgan listened to the proposal, and said he was 
highly gratified to have pleased his commander, but declined tlie pro- 
motion. He added, that he believed himself a good soldier, but that 
he was by no means certain he should make a good sergeant; that 
he joined tlie army from a principle of duty and patriotism, because he 
believed his country needed his services, and the same motives induced 
him to prefer a station where he was satisfied he should be tlie most 
useful. The general then oifered him money, but this he refused also, 
saying his circumstances were such at home, that he did not need money. 
"What then can I do for you?" inquired the general. "I have one 
favor to ask," replied Morgan ; " during my absence some person has 
taken my gun ; I set a great value upon it, and, if it can be restored, it 
will give me particular pleasure." The gun was described, and the 
general issued an order requiring it to be returned. This was all the 
reward, that Morgan could ever be prevailed on to accept. 

The above anecdote was related to me by General Lafayette himself, 
nearly fifty years after tlie event, with much warmth of feeling and ad- 
miration of the soldier's magnanimity. 

* An animated account of the effect, which this intelligence produced 
on the French officers, is given by the Abb6 Robin. The French army 
had entered Philadelphia in the morning of that day, amidst the accla-

Sir, 

I have been honored by your Excellency's favor 
of the 2d instant, and do mysi-if the jilcasure to fe- 
licitate you on the happy arrival of so formidable a 
fleet of his Most Christian Majesty in the Bay of 
Chesapeake under your Excellency's command. This 
happy event I hope will be improved to the most 
salutary purposes for the united interests of both 
nations. 

Expecting to have the honor of a personal interview 
with your Excellency almost as soon as this will reach 
your h;\iu1, I shall not, in writing, give you the trouble 
of a particular detail of my designs. I will only in- 
form you that the van of the two armies, the French 
and Americans, consisting of about two thousand men, 
(there not being transports for the whole) will embark 
in about two days, and will fall down the Chesapeake 



mations of t)io people. On every side wore demonstrations of joy. 
After the spectacle was over, the officers dined with the Chevalier de la

to tlic Chevalier containing the news. — JVbuiifdK I'oyafre, p. 00. 

The Abbe Robin landed at Boston in Juno with the reinforcement 
detached from the squadron of M. dc Grassc. He joined Rochambcau's 
army, and marclied with it to Virginia. The next year he published in 
Paris the result of his observations in .\merica, embracing military opera-

manners, and habits of the people. His book is entitled JsTouvcau I'oyafrc

sketches are lively and spirited. A good temper is visible in all his 
remarks. His prevailing foible may be a.wribed to his former secluded 
mode of life. The novelty of the scene seemed to fill him with a wonder 
similar to that, which wo may suppose to have been e.xpericnced by 
the companions of Columbus on their first visit to the New World. The 
Abbe's astonishment at common things sometimes reaches so high, as 
to become a hazardous experiment on the graWty of his readers.

of the Count de St. Simon, and the ]\Iarquis de La- 
fayette, and to cooperate in blocking up CornwaUis m 
York River, and preventing him from making his re- 
treat by land, or collecting any supplies from the 
country. This junction of the van of our troops is 
proposed to be made in James River, unless your Ex- 
cellency and the commanders of the land troops should 
judge some other point of debarkation to be more 
favorable to our intentions; in which case you will be 
pleased to meet the transports while on their way, with 
orders to proceed to any other point which may be 
fixed on. 

The remainder of the troops from hence will be 
forwarded with all the expedition our circumstances will 
admit. In the mean time, as it will be of the great- 
est importance to prevent the escape of his Lordship 
from his present position, I am persuaded that every 
measure, wiiich prudence can dictate, will be adopted 
for that purpose, until the arrival of our complete force, 
when I hope his Lordship will be compelled to yield his 
ground to the superior power of our combined forces.

My dear Marquis, 
I have received with infinite satisfaction the informa-

an additional pleasure in findmg, that your ideas on 
every occasion have been so consonant to my own, and 
that by your military dispositions and prudent meas- 
ures you have anticipated all my wishes. Every thing

be avoided. 

We shall have transports enougii, I bclicvr, to em-

commence the operation as soon as it is possible in 
the nature of things to be done. I forl)car to enter 
into more pai-ticulars, as I shall set out for the theatre

of making every arrangement, in conjunction with the

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to inform Congress, that I arrived 
at this place last evening ; that, soon after my arrival, 
I received the pleasing intelligence, that the Count de 
Grasse, who had put to sea on the 5th in pursuit of 
the British fleet, had returned to his former station at 
Cape Henry, having driven the British from the coast, 
taken two of their frigates, and effected a junction 
with the squadron of the Count de Barras.* 

In consequence of my having been informed of the 
sailing of the fleet from the Capes, and being appre- 
hensive that we were not assured of the security of 
our navigation in the bay, I had ordered the troops, 
who were embarked at the Head of Elk, to stop until 
we had further intelligence. Orders are this morning 
gone on to press them forward with every despatch 
possible. I am distressed to find, that the supplies of 
the army collecting here are on too precarious a foot- 
ing. Already a want of provisions has been experi- 
enced. Every measure is taking, that is in my power, 
to be better assured of our supplies in future. How 
far I shall succeed in my endeavours, time must dis- 
cover. I have the honor to be, &c. 



* On his passage from the West Indies to the Chesapeake, Count 
de Grasse captured a British armed vessel, bound from Charleston to 
New York, in which was Lord Rawdon, who was taken prisoner and 
brought into the Chesapeake.

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 
Dkah SlH, 

Upon information of the sailing of the ileet from the 
Chesapeake Bay, I gave orders for the troops, who 
were enibarkeil, to be stopped. Since my ai-rival at 
this place, I am informed that Count de Grasse has 
been joined by Count de Barras, and, having cap- 
tured two English frigates, has returned to his former 
station at the Capes. On this pleasing information 
I have sent forward Count Fersen to hurry on the 
troops with all possible despatch. Every day we now 
lose is comparatively an age. As soon as it is in our 
power with safety, we ought to take our position near 
the enemy. Hurry on then, my dear Sir, with your 
troops on the wings of speed. The want of our men 
and stores is now all that retards our immediate 
operations. Lord Cornwallis is improving every mo- 
ment to the best advantage ; and every day that is 
given him to make his preparations may cost us many 
lives to encounter thoni. 

I am very sensible of your vigilance and activity. 
My impatience, however, to commence our operations 
impels me to write as I have done. You will come 
with your troops to the College Landing in James 
River, where, unless you receive other orders, you 
will debark. I am, &c.

place. I am at a loss to express the pleasure, which 
I have in congratulating your Excellency on your re- 
turn to your former station in the bay, and the happy 
circumstance of forming a junction with the squadron 
of the Count da Barras. I take particular satisfaction 
in felicitating your Excellency on the glory of having 
driven the British fleet from the coast, and taking 
two of their frigates. These happy events, and the 
decided superiority of your fleet, give us the happiest 
presages of the most complete success in our com- 
bined operations in this bay. 

It is with much regret, that I find the want of 
transports in the bay has retarded the progress of 
the troops expected from the northward. If it is 
possible for your Excellency to give us any assistance 
in this distress, it will be attended with inexpressible 
advantage to the prosecution of our measures, and will 
be acknowledged with the highest gratitude. Such of 
our troops, as could not be embarked at the Head of 
Elk, are marching to Baltimore, where they are to be 
put on board such transports as may be collected at 
that place. 

It is very much the wish of the Count de Rocham- 
beau, as Avell as of myself, to have the honor of an 
interview with your Excellency ; but our particular 
circumstances render us dependent on your goodness 
for the means of conveyance. If your Excellency 
could despatch some fast-sailing cutter to receive us 
on board, and inform us as to the time and place, 
we shall be very happy to attend on you, at the earli- 
est moment you shall fix. Count Fersen, an aid to 
Count de Rochambeau, is sent on to hurry down the 
troops that are embarking. If your Excellency can 
furnish him the means of proceeding up the bay, it will 
be very agreeable. I am, &c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAI. ST. CI, A IK. 

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 

Dkar Sir, 
I have to request you, in the most earnest manner, 
to send forward all the recruits that arc furnished by 
the State of Pennsylvania for their line. Let it not 
be said, that those troops are kept from service for 
want of a few articles, which they could wish to be 
furnished with, when other troops doing duty in the 
field are combating almost every distress imaginable 
in the want of almost every necessary. If any thing 
in the power of the State can be instantly done to- 
wards their equipment, I wish the authorities to be 
called upon, and hope they will furnish what they can 
without delay. It is the highest absurdity in the world 
to keep those troops in a state of idleness at great 
expense, and at the same time for want of them to 
put the public to the same or much greater charge, 
by calling in the aid of militia, which we are now 
obliged to do. I beg you, therefore, to hurry on those 
troops, with all the expedition in your power, by wa- 
ter down the Chesapeake, embarking at Baltimore, 

•On the 10th of September, Count de Barraa arrived in the Chesapeake, 
with the .itjuadron from Rhode Island, Uic French siege artillery, and 
the land forces under M. de Choisy. Ten transports from lliis squad- 
ron, two frigates lately captured from the enemy, and other prize- 
vessels, were immediately despatched up the bay to receive on board 
the French troops, who could not find means of transportation from the 
Head of Klk and Baltimore, and liad pursued their route by land. They 
embarked at Annapolis, and proceeded by water to James River.

where craft can doubtless be found by taking the 
proper precaution, and tlieir transportation will be per- 
fectly secure, so long as the lleet maintains its pres- 
ent station. The place of debarkation will be in James 
River, probably at the College Landing, unless further 
orders shall be given to carry them to some other place 
nearer the pomt of our operations. I am, &,c.* 



TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Williamsburg, 22 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

The enclosed letter for your Excellency, and the 
copies of others to Count de Rochambeau and myself, 
have this moment come to my hands. I deem the 
intelligence they contain of so much importance, that 
I have thought it proper to transmit them immediately 
to you by the Baron Closen, one of the aids-de-camp 
to Count de Rochambeau.t I am, dear Sir, &c. 

* From the Diary, September 17th. — "In company with Count de Ro- 
chambeau, the Chevalier de Chastellux, General Knox, and General Du- 
portail, I set out for an interview with tlie admiral, and arrived on board 
the Ville de Paris (off Cape Henry) the next day about noon ; and, 
having settled most points with him to my satisfaction, except not ob- 
taining an assurance of sending ships above York, I embarked on board 
the Queen Charlotte, the vessel I went down in; but, by reason of 
Imrd blowing and contrary winds, I did not reach Williamsburg again

Count de Grasse also gave notice, that his fleet could not continue 
on this station beyond the 1st of November.

had just anived at New York with a reinforcement of six ships of the 
line.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF COXORESS. 

Williamsburg, 23 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

On my arrival at this place I tbund it would be at- 
tended with good consequences for me to see Admi- 
ral de Grasse in person. This visit I have performed, 
and met the Count on board the Ville de Paris at 
Cape Henry, from whence I have just returned. I am 
happy to inform Congress, that I found the French 
admiral disposed in the best manner to give us all the 
assistance in his power, and perfectly to cooperate 
with me in our present attempt. 

The vessels from the Head of Elk are now debark- 
ing their stores and troops, except some few w^hich 
are not yet arrived. This is accounted for from their 
being dull sailers. They are expected soon. I still 
find myself embarrassed for want of provisions, and 
sufficient means of transportation ; but by superior ex- 
ertions I hope to surmount these difficulties, and to find 
myself soon before the enemy's works at York and 
Gloucester. I have the honor to be, &lc. 



TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Williamsburg, 25 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I cannot conceal from your Excellency the painful 
anxiety under wtiich I have labored since the receipt 
of the letter, with which you honored me on the 2.3d 
instant.* The naval movements, which your Excel- 
lency states there as possible, considering the intel- 
ligence communicated to you by Baron de Closen, 

• See this letter in the Appendix, No. VII. 



164 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [yEt. 49. 

make it incumbent upon me to represent the conse- 
quences that would ai-ise from them, and to urge a per- 
severance in the plan ah-eady agreed upon. Give me 
leave, in the first place, to repeat to your Excellency, 
that the enterprise against York, under the protection 
of your ships, is as certain as any military operation 
can be rendered by a decisive superiority of strength 
and means ; that it is in fact reducible to calculation ; 
that the surrender of the British garrison will be im- 
portant in itself and its consequences ; and that it must 
necessarily go a great way towards terminating the 
war, and securing the invaluable objects of it to the 
allies. 

Your Excellency's departure from the Chesapeake, 
by affording an opening for the succour of York, which 
the enemy would instantly avail themselves of, would 
frustrate these brilliant prospects ; and the consequence 
would be, not only the disgrace and loss of i-enouncing 
an enterprise, upon which the fairest expectations of 
the allies have been founded, after the most expen- 
sive preparations and uncommon exertions and fatigues, 
but perhaps the disbanding of the whole army for want 
of provisions. 

The present theatre of the war is totally deficient in 
the means of land transportation, being intersected by 
large rivers, and the whole dependence for interior 
communication being upon small vessels. The country 
has besides been so much exhausted by the ravages 
of the enemy, and the subsistence of our own army, 
that our supplies can only be drawn from a distance, 
and under cover of a fleet commanding the Chesa- 
peake. I most earnestly entreat your Excellency far- 
ther to consider, that, if the present opportunity should 
be missed, and you should withdraw your maritime 
force from the position agreed upon, no future day can 



Tart 11.) THE AMKRICAN RKVOI.UTION. 1 n5 

restore to us a similar occasion lor striking a decisive 
blow ; that the British will be indcratigable in strength- 
ening their most important maritime points ; and that 
the time oi' an honorable peace will be more remote 
than ever. 

The confidence, with \vhich I feel myself inspired 
by ilic energy of character and naval talents, which so 
eminently distinguish your Excellency, leaves me no 
doubt, tliat, upon a consideration of the consequences, 
which must follow your departure from the Chesa- 
peake, you will determine upon the measure, which 
the dearest interests of the common cause would dic- 
tate. I had invariably flattered myself, from the ac- 
counts given me by skilful mariners, that your position, 
moored in the Chesapeake, might be made so re- 
spectable as to bid defiance to any attempt on the part 
of the British fleet, at the same time that it would sup- 
port the operations of a siege, secure the transportation 
of our supplies by water, and economize the most 
precious time by facilitating the debarkation of our 
heavy artillery and stores conveniently to the trenches 
in York River. It is to be observed, that the strength 
of the enemy's reinforcement under Admiral Digby, as 
we have the intelligence from the British, may not only 
be exaggerated, but altogether a finesse ; and, suppos- 
ing the account consistent with truth, their total force, 
it was hoped, would not put them in a condition to 
attack with any prospect of success. 

If the stationary position, which had been agreed 
upon, should be found utterly impracticable, there is an 
alternative, which however inferior, considered relatively 
to the support and facility of our land operations, would 
save our affairs from ruin. This is, to cruise with your 
fleet within view of the Capes, so as effectually to pre- 
vent the entrance of any British vessels. 



166 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

Upon the whole, I should esteem myself deficient in 
my duty to the common cause of France and America, 
if I did not persevere in entreating your Excellency 
to resume the plans, that have been so happily ar- 
ranged ; and, if invincible maritime reasons shall prevent, 
I depend as a last resource upon your pursuing the al- 
ternative above mentioned, and rendering the Chesa- 
peake inaccessible to any enemy's vessel. 

However the British admiral may manoeuvre, and 
endeavour to divert your Excellency from the object 
in view, I can hardly admit a belief, that it can be his 
serious intention to engage in a general action with a 
fleet, whose force will be superior, supposing the most 
flattering accounts of the British to be true ; past ex- 
perience having taught them to engage with caution, 
even upon equal terms, and forced from them acknow- 
ledgments, wdiich prove the respect with which they 
have been inspired. Let me add. Sir, that even a mo- 
mentar}' absence of the French fleet may expose us to 
the loss of the British garrison at York ; as in the 
present state of affairs. Lord Cornwallis might effect 
the evacuation with the loss of his artillery and bag- 
gage, and such a sacrifice of men as his object would 
evidently justify. 

The Marquis de Lafayette, who does me the honor 
to bear this to your Excellency, will explain many par- 
ticularities of our situation, which could not well be 
comprised in a letter. His candor and abihties are well 
known to you, and entitle him to the fullest confidence 
in treating of the most important interests. I have 
earnestly requested him not to proceed any farther

TO COr.VT DK GUASSE. 

Head-Quarters, 27 September, 1781. 

Siu, 
I am much indebted to your Excellency for the in- 
stant communication, with which you have honored me, 
of the disposition that you have determined for your 
fleet. The resolutions that you have taken in our cir- 
cumstances prove, that a great mind knows how to 
make personal sacrifices to secure an important gen- 
eral good. Fully sensible of those, which you have 
made on the present occasion, I flatter myself, that 
the result of the operations, conducted under your 
auspices, will compensate them by its utility to the 
common cause. Your Excellency may depend on ev- 
ery assistance, that the allied armies can give, rela- 
tively to the battery which you propose at Point Com- 
fort, and that our utmost exertions will be used in 
hastening the investment of the enemy. I am, &c. 

P. S. I am this moment informed by deserters, 
that the enemy are preparing more fire-ships against 



the siege. He laid the matter before a council of war. " The result Ims 
been," said he in his reply, " that tlie plan I had sng-gcsted was the most 
brilliant and glorious, but it would not fulfil the views we had proposed. 
It is consequently decided, that a large part of the fleet shall anchor in 
York River, tiiat four or five vessels shall be stationed so as to pass up 
and down in James River, and that you shall aid us with the means to 
erect a battery on Point Comfort, where wc can place cannon and mor- 
tars. We shall immediately proceed to execute this arrangement, and 
I hasten to give you notice, that we may act in concert for the advance- 
ment of our operations."

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp, near York, I October, 1781. 

Sir, 
Last evening I was honored with your Excellency's 
favor of the 21st with its enclosure. The intelligence 
contained in it, respecting the British fleet, is very 
agreeable, and has been transmitted to Admiral de 
Grasse. In my last I informed you, that our prepa- 
rations for a near investment of the enemy at York 
were fast ripening to a point. I have now to acquaint 
your Excellency, that I marched from Williamsburg 
with the whole army on the 28th, and approached near 
to the enemy, about two miles from York, where a show 
was made of some opposition on our left ; but. Count 
de Rochambeau, who commanded that part of the ar- 
my, moving some field-artillery towards them, under 
direction of the Baron Viomenil, and giving a few shot, 

* Near the British works at Gloucester were stationed the legion of 
the Duke de Lauzun, and the Virginia militia under General Weedon. 
Those officers represented, that, considering the nature of tlie ground, 
their strength, and tlie facility with which the enemy might reinforce 
that post, an augmentation of tlieir numbers was indispensable, both to 
enable them to occupy a good defensive position, and to confine the 
enemy within their lines. General Washington applied to Count de 
Grasse for a detachment of si.x or eight hundred marines to be sent 
from his ships on this service. M. de Choisy was the bearer of the let- 
ter making the request. Tlie troops were obtained, though Count de 
Grasse spared them with reluctance, and desired that no future requi- 
sition of the kind might be made upon him, as his situation was criti- 
cal, and he was unwilling to have his men so divided as to subject 
him to embarrassment in case of a contingency. The American and 
French troops at Gloucester were put under the command of M. de 
Choisy, who was a brigadier-general in the French service.

they retired. (Jii tlie '2'Jl\\, the Anieriean iroops niovecl 
forward, and took their ground in front of the enemy's 
works on their left ; there being no opposition, save a 
few scattered shot from a small work by Moor's Mill, 
and a battery on the left of Pigeon Quarter. There 
was a small fii'e all day from our riflemen and the 
enemy's Yagers. On the 30th in the morning we dis- 
covered that the enemy had evacuated all their ex- 
terior works, and withdrawn themselves to those near 
the town. By this means we are in possession of very 
advantageous grounds, Avhich command their line of 
works in a very near advance. All the expedition, 
that our circumstances will admit, is using to bring up 
our heavy artillery and stores to open our batteries. 
This work I hope will be executed in a few days, 
when our fire will immediately commence. 

The investment of the enemy is fully completed and 
drawn very near to their lines, saving the water com- 
munication above the town on York River. To com- 
plete that part, a request is gone to Count de Grasse, 
desiring him to push a ship or two above the town; 
which, if efl'ectcd, will answer many very valuable pur- 
poses. The position of Count de Grasse is judi- 
ciously taken, the main fleet being disposed in Lynn- 
haven Bay, and detachments made to secure the riv- 
ers ; and the determination of the Count seems to be 
fully to comply with our wishes in every necessary co- 
operation. I shall continue to keep Congress advised 
of such occurrences as are worthy the communication. 

I have the honor to be, <Scc.

170 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 49. 

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Before York, 1 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I should have had the honor of acknowledging soon- 
er the note, which your Excellency transmitted by the 
Marquis de Lafayette, but an expectation of being able 
to accompan}' my answer with interesting intelligence 
induced me to defer it to the present moment. With 
regard to the station, which your Excellency has de- 
termined for the main fleet, the reasons, which you are 
pleased to communicate, prove that it unites all ad- 
vantages, and inspire the greatest confidence in the 
accomplishment of its object. 

I have only one proposition to submit on the subject 
of naval dispositions, and the objects of it are too es- 
sential not to be exposed in theu- fullest light. I mean 
the stationing two or three ships above the enemy's 
posts on York River. For the want of this only means 
of completing the investment of their works, the Brit- 
ish remain masters of the navigation for twenty-five 
miles above them, and have, by their armed vessels, 
intercepted supplies of the greatest value on their way 
to our camp. The loss is redoubled, by diminishing 
our means and augmenting those of the enemy at a 
most critical time. We are even necessitated, for the 
protection of Williamsburg and the magazines in our 
rear, to leave a post of seven or eight hundred men in 
that quarter ; a diminution of our force that in present 
circumstances we can but ill support. But, unless this 
detachment is made, the enemy might in the greatest 
security land above Queen's Creek to cover their left 
flank, and by a very short march eflect the most de- 
structive purposes; while the ch-cuitous march which 
we, from the nature of the country, should be obliged 



PartIi.i tin: amkiucan rkvoi.ution. 171 

to nuike, would rciuk-r it impossible to arrive in time 
to prevent or punish them. We are besides reduced to 
the impossibility of concerting measures with the corps 
of troops at CJk)Ucester, being obliged, in order to com- 
municate with them, to make a circuit of near ninety 
miles, whereas in the other case it would be both easy 
and expeditious. IJut what is a still more decisive con- 
sideration is, that Lord Cornwallis has, by the York 
River, an outlet for his retreat, and tiiat he may, by 
embracing a leading wind and tide and stealing a march, 
proceed unmolested to West Point, where, upon de- 
barking his troops, he will have tlie Panumky on one 
flank and the Mattapony on the other ; and that finally 
he may, by mounting the greater part ol' liis men, and 
by successive forced marches, push his way, with a 
compact, disciplined army, through a country whose 
population is too scattered to be collected for sudden 
opposition, and make it impossible for us to overtake 
him. Many people arc of opinion, tiiat Lord Corn- 
wallis will embrace this as the only means of safety ; 
and it is certain, that, unless the investment is com- 
pleted as above mentioned, he will have it in his pow- 
er either now or in a last extremity. 

The present position of the fleet and army perfectly 
secures us against every enterprise on the part of the 
enemy in James River. 

Upon the whole, I can assure your Excellency, that 
this seems to be the only point in which we are de- 
fective. The enemy have already abandoned all their 
exterior works, and withdrawn altogether to the body 
of the place, and given us great advantages for open- 
ing the trenches. The engineers have had a near and 
satisfactory view of the works, without interruption, and 
we have most to apprehend Lord Cornwallis's escape. 

For these reasons I earnestly entreat, that you will 



172 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

be pleased to authorize and enjoin the commanding 
officer of the ships in York River, to concert measures 
with me for the purpose above mentioned. In this case 
an additional ship may be necessary to remain at the 
mouth of the river. The Experiment and two frigates, 
if your Excellency thinks proper, would be best cal- 
culated for the station above. 

If, upon mature examination of the passage, it should 
appear too great a risk for the ships, I would at least 
solicit your Excellency, that the vessels may advance 
higher up the river, and take a more menacing position 
with respect to the enemy on our right. But I must 
confess, that I am so well satisfied by experience, of 
the little eflect of land batteries on vessels passing 
them with a leading breeze, that, unless the two chan- 
nels near York should be found impracticable by ob- 
structions, I should have the greatest confidence in the 
success of this important service. 

Your Excellency's approbation of this measure would 
supersede the necessity of a defence against fire-ships. 
But the nature of the river besides renders it physi- 
cally impossible to form any obstructions of the kind 
proposed. I entreat your Excellency to accept the 
sentiments of respectful attachment, with which I have 
the honor to be, &c.* 

* The attempt to pass up York River was declined by Count de 
Grasse, not because he thought the works at York and Gloucester would 
present serious obstacles, but because he believed his large vessels would 
not be secure in that station. The enemy had a great number of boats 
and small craft, and witli these they could easily bring fire-ships in the 
night, from which his vessels would be exposed to imminent danger, 
confined in tlie narrow channel of a river ; especially as he had not in 
his whole fleet a suflicient number of row-boats and light craft for de- 
fence in such a situation, even if they could all be transported up the 
river in safety. This objection he deemed insuperable, and tlie project 
was laid aside. It was revived again, however, a few days afterwards. 
The passage and the river above York were reconnoitred by a French 
officer, and, upon his representation, Count de Grasse agreed to send

Sir, 

Since mine to your Excellency of the 1st instant, 
we have been employed in repairing the enemy's works

our troops in making their approaches. We have been

and in transporting our heavy cannon, mortars, and 
stores from Trebell's Landing, on James River. In 
the last we made slow progress, until the airival of 
the wagons and teams from the northward ; but, it 
being the opinion of the engineers, that we now have 
a suflicient stock to commence operations, we shall 
this night open trenches. I take a very singular pleas-

which that minister approved, saying, that he would use his influence

as resultiui^ from the perfect good understanding be-

never be interrupted, and I am sure it never can be 
while we are all influenced by the same pure motive, 
that of love to our country and interest in the cause 
in wjiich we are embarked. I have happily had but 
few diflerences with those, with whom I have the honor 
of being connected in the service. With whom, and 
of what nature these have been, you know. I bore 
much for the sake of peace and the public good. My 
conscience tells me, that I acted right in these trans- 
actions ; and, should they ever come to the knowledge 
of the world, I trust I shall stand acquitted by it. 

Baron Steuben, from the warmth of his temper, had 
got disagreeably involved with the State, and an in- 
quiry into pai't of Ills conduct must one day take 
place, both for his own honor and their satisfaction. I 
have for the present given him a command in this ar-

such a manner against the common enemy, that the 
interests of his Most Catholic Majesty and those of

You must be sensible, that, in the present political 
situation of affairs, I cannot, with any degi'ee of pro-

joint plan of operations to General Galvez, though I 
flatter myself that difficulty will be ere long removed. 

Neither can I at this time determine whether we 
shall be able to act offensively against the enemy in 
South Carolina and Georgia. That will in a great 
measure depend upon the naval assistance we shall 
be able to derive from our ally. Of this you may as-

formed, which is to be undertaken by the allied arms, 
I will use my influence with the French commanders 
to give him due notice, should I not be able to open

necessity he was under of granting the terms of capitu-

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, before York, 12 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

My last despatch to your Excellency was of the Gth. 
I then informed you, that we should open trenches that 
night. We did so, and cstahlisheil our lirst parallel 
within six hundred yards of the enemy's works, with 
the loss of only one ollicer of the French artillery 
wounded, and sixteen privates killed and wounded, the 
greater part of w lunn wcii' of the French line. 

The 7th and 8th we were employed in completing 
the first parallel, and in erecting batteries somewhat 
advanced of it. On the 9th, at five o'clock in the af- 
ternoon, the American battery on the right opened, 
having six eighteen and twenty-four pounders, two 
mortars, and two howitzers ; and at three o'clock the 
French battery on the left opened, having four twelve- 
pounders, and six mortars and howitzers. We were 
informed, that our shells did considerable execution in 
the town, and we could perceive that our shot, which 
were directed against the enemy's embrasures, mjured 
them much. The 10th, two French batteries, one of 
ten eighteen and twenty-four pounders, and six mor- 
tars and howitzers, the other of four eighteen-pounders, 
opened, as did two more American batteries, one of 
four eighteen-pounders, the other of two mortars. The 
fire now became so excessively heavy, that the enemy 
withdrew their cannon from their embrasures, placed 
them behind the merlins, and scarcely fired a shot 
during the whole day. In the evening the Charon 
frigate of forty -four guns was set on fire by a hot shot 
from the French battery on the left, and entirely con- 
sumed. Her guns and stores had been taken out. By 
the report of a deserter, our shells, w hich were thrown

with the utmost degree of precision, did much mis- 
chief in the course of the day. 

Yesterday morning two oi" the enemy's transports 
were fired by hot shot and burnt. This has occasioned 
them to warp their shipping as far over to the Glouces- 
ter shore as possible. We last night advanced our 
second parallel within three hundred yards of the en- 
emy's works, with little or no annoyance from them. 
Only one man was killed, and three or four wounded. 
I shall think it strange indeed, if Lord Cornwallis makes 
no vigorous exertions in the course of this night, or 
very soon after. 

I cannot but acknowledge the infinite obligations I 
am under to Count de Rochambeau, the Marquis de 
St. Simon, commanding the troops from the West Indies, 
the other general officers, and indeed the officers of 
every denomination in the French ai'my, for the assist- 
ance which they afford me. The experience of many 
of those gendemen, in the business before us, is of the 
utmost advantage in the present operation. And I am 
sensible it must give your Excellency and Congress 
the highest pleasure to know, that the greatest har- 
mony prevails between the two armies. They seem 
actuated by one spirit, that of supporting the honor of 
the allied arms, and pushing their approaches with the 
utmost vigor. I have the honor to be, &.c.

we wore finploycLl in completing it. Tlic engineers 
having deemed the two redoubts on the left of the en- 
emy's line sudiciently injured by our shot and shells 
to make them practicable, it was determined to carry 
them by assault on the evening ol the 14th. The fol- 
lowing tlisposition was accordingly made. The vsork 
on the enemy's extreme left was to be attacked by the 
American light intantry under the command of the 
Marquis de Lafayette ; tlie other by a detachment of 
the French grenadiers and chasseurs, commanded by 
Major-General the Biu-on Viomenil. I have the pleas- 
ure to inform your Excellency, that we succeeded in 
both. iVothing could exceed the lirmness and bravery 
of the troops. They advanced under the fire of the 
enemy without returning a shot, and effected the busi- 
ness by the bayonet only. The reports of his Excel- 
lency the Count de Rochambeau, the Marquis de La- 
fayette, and Lieutenant-Colonel Iliunilton,* co[)ies of

Lafayette said in his report ; — " Colonel Gimat'3 battalion led the van, 
and was followed by that of Colonel Hamilton, who commanded the 
whole advanced corps. At the same time a party of eighty men, under 
Colonel Laurens, turned tlic redoubt. I beg leave to refer your Excel- 
lency to the report I have received from Colonel Hamilton, whose well- 
known talents and frallantry were on this occasion most conspicuous and 
serviceable. Our obligations to him, to Colonel Gimat, and to Colonel 
Laurens, each and all the olScers and men, are above expression. Not 
one gun was fired ; and the ardor of tlie troops did not give time for the 
sappers to derange the abatis ; and, owing to the conduct of the com- 
manders and bravery of the men, the redoubt was stormed with an un- 
common rapidity. Colonel Barber's battalion, which was the first in the 
supporting column, being detached to the aid of the advance, arrived at 
the moment they were getting over the works, and executed their or- 
ders witli the utmost alacrity. The Colonel was slightly wounded." —

which I enclose, enter more particularly into a detail 
of the mode in which the attacks on the parts of the 
French and American columns were conducted. We 
made prisoners in both redoubts, one major, two cap- 
tains, three subalterns, and sixty-seven privates. 

The works, which we have carried, are of vast im- 
portance to us. From them we shall enfilade the en- 
emy's whole line, and I am in hopes we shall be able 
to command the communication from York to Glouces- 
ter. I think the batteries of the second parallel will be 
in sufficient forwardness to begin to play in the course 
of this day. The enemy last night made a sortie for 
the first time. They entered one of the French and 
one of the American batteries on the second parallel, 
which were unfinished. They had only time to thrust 
the points of their bayonets into the touch-holes of four 
pieces of the French and two of the American artil- 
lery, and break them ofl'; but the spikes were easily 
extracted. They were repulsed the moment the sup- 
porting troops came up, leaving behind them seven or 
eight dead, and six prisoners. The French had four 
officers and twelve privates killed and wounded, and 
we had one sergeant mortally wounded. I enclose to 
your Excellency a return of the killed and wounded 

said Colonel Hamilton in his report, ' of imitating examples of barbarity, 
and forgetting recent provocations, the soldiery spared every man that 
ceased to resist.' Mr. Gordon, in his History of the American War, states 
the orders given by Lafayette, with the approbation of Wasliington, to 
have directed that every man in the redoubt, after its surrender, should 
be put to the sword. These sanguinary orders, so repugnant to the 
character of the Commander-in-chief and of Lafayette, were never giv- 
en. There is no trace of them among the papers of General Wash- 
ington ; and Colonel Hamilton, who took a part in the enterprise, which 
assures his perfect knowledge of every material occurrence, has pub- 
licly contradicted the statement." — Marshall's Life of Washington, 
Vol. IV. p. 486.

Sir, 
I had yesterday evening the honor of receiving your 
Excellency's favor of tiie same date. Sixteen flat- 
boats will be ready to meet the ships whenever the 
wind shall admit their ascending the river. I cannot 
conceive the reason why no more pilots have gone 
down to you. The governor sent immediately to those, 
who were recommended by Captain Lilly. 

I do myself the honor to transmit the copy of a let- 
ter, which I have just received from Lord Cornwallis. 
I have informed him in answer thereto, that I wish 
him, previous to the meeting of the commissioners, to 
send his proposals in writing to the American lines, 
for which purpose a cessation of hostilities for two 
hours will be allowed. 

I shouKl be anxious to have the honor of your Ex- 
cellency's participation in the treaty, which will accord- 
ing to present appearance shortly take place. I need 
not add how happy it will make me to welcome your 
Excellency m the name of America on this shore, and 
embrace vou upon an occasion so advantageous to the 
interests of the common cause, and on which it is so 
much indebted to you.

Sir, 
I have the honor, with many congratulations, to in-

for the delivery of two of the enemy's redoubts on the 
Gloucester side ; one to a detachment of French, the

the cavalry with their swords drawn, and the colors 
of the whole cased,) to a place which you will be so 
good as to appoint, in front of the posts, where they 
will ground their arms, and afterwards return to their

Corinvallis, is most happily eilectcd. Tlic uiiix-niittcd 
artlor, whicii actuatod every oflicer and soldier in the 
combined army on this occasion, has principally led to 
this important event, at an earlier period than my most 
sanECiiini' Imjics had induced me to expect. 

The singular spirit ol' emulation, which animated the 
whole army from the first commencement of our ope- 
rations, has filled my mind with the highest pleasure 
and satisfaction, and had given me the happiest presages 
of success. 

On the 17th instant, a letter was received from Lord 
Cornwallis, proposing a meeting of commissioners to 
consult on terms for the surrender of the posts of 
York and Gloucester. This letter (the first that had 
passed between us) opened a correspondence, a copy 
of which I do myself the honor to enclose ; that cor- 
respondence was followed by the definitive capitula- 
tion, which was agreed to and signed on the 19tli, a 
copy of which I herewith transmit, and which, I hope, 
will meet with the approbation of Congress. 

I should be wanting in feelings of gratitude, did I 
not mention, on this occasion, with the warmest sense 
of acknowledgment, the very cheerful and able as- 
sistance, which I have received in the course of our 
operation from his Excellency the Count de Rocham- 
beau. Nothing could equal this zeal of our allies, but 
the emulating spirit of the American officers, whose ar- 
dor would not suffer their exertions to be exceeded. 

The very uncommon degree of duty and fatigue, 
which the nature of the service required from the of- 
ficers of engineers and artillery of both armies, obliges 
me particularly to mention the obligations I am under 
to the commanding and other officers of those corps. 

I wish it were in my power to express to Congress, 
how much I feel myself indebted to the Count dc 



184 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JE-i: 49. 

Grasse and the officers of the fleet under his com- 
mand, for the distinguished aid and support which have 
been aflbrded by them, between whom and the army 
the most happy concurrence of sentiments and views 
has subsisted, and from whom every possible coopera- 
tion has been experienced, which the most harmonious 
intercouj'se could afford. 

Returns of the prisoners, military stores, ordnance, 
shipping, and other matters, I shall do myself the honor 
to transmit to Congress, as soon as they can be col- 
lected by the heads of the departments to which they 
belong. 

Colonel Laurens and the Viscount de Noailles, on 
the part of the combined army, were the gentlemen 
who acted as commissioners for forming and settling 
the terms of capitulation and surrender, herewith trans- 
mitted, to whom I am particularly obliged for then* 
readiness and attention exhibited on the occasion. 

Colonel Tilghman, one of my aids-de-camp, will 
have the honor to deliver these despatches to your 
Excellency ; he will be able to inform you of every 
minute circumstance, which is not particularly mention- 
ed in my letter. His merits, which are too well known 
to need any observations at this time, have gained my 
particular attention, and I could wish that they may 
be honored by the notice of your Excellency and 
Congress. 

Your Excellency and Congress will be pleased to 
accept my congratulations on this happy event, and be- 
lieve me to be, with the highest esteem, &c.* 

* This letter was referred to a committee of Congress, who reported 
a series of resolves, which were adopted. The thanks of Congress were 
voted to General Washington, Count de Rochambeau, and Count de 
Grasse respectively, and also to aU the officers and soldiers. Two stands 
of colors, taken at Yorktown, were presented to General Washington ; 
two pieces of field-ordnance to Count de Rochambeau ; and a similar

TO COUNT DE rjRASSE. 

Head-Quarters, 20 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

The surrender of York, from which so great glory 
and advantage are derived to the allies, and the honor 
of which belongs to your Excellency, has greatly an- 
ticipated our most sanguine expectations. Certain of 
this event, under your auspices, though unaltle to de- 
termine the time, I solicited your attention, in the hrst 
conference with which you honored me, to ulterior 
objects of decisive importance to the conmion cause. 
Although your answer on that occasion was unfavorable 
to my wishes, the unexpected promptness, with which 
our operations here have been conducted to their fmal 
success, having gained us time, the defect of which 
was one of your principal objections, a conviction of 
the most extensive and happy consequences engages 
me to renew my representation. 

Charleston, the principal maritime port of the British 
in the southern parts of the continent, the grand de- 
posit and point of support for the present theatre of 
the war, is open to a combined attack, and might be 
carried with as much certainty as the place which has 
just surrendered. This capture would destroy the last 
hope, which induces the enemy to continue the war; 
for, having experienced the impracticability of recover- 
ing the populous northern States, they have determined 
to confine themselves to the defensive in that quarter, 

tribute to Count de Grasse. A horse, properly caparisoned, and an 
elegant sword, were given to Colonel Tilghman, who had been the bearer 
of the despatches containing the news of the capitulation. It was also 
resolved, that Congress would cause to be erected at Vorktown a marble 
column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United 
States and France, and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the events 
of the siege and capitulation. — Journals, October '^Jlh.

and prosecute a most vigorous offensive at the south- 
ward, with a view of reconquering States, whose sparse 
population and natural disadvantages render them in- 
finitely less susceptible of defence, although their 
productions make them the most valuable in a com- 
mercial view. Their general naval superiority, previous 
to your arrival, gave them decisive advantages in the 
rapid transport of their troops and supplies, while the 
immense land marches of our succours, too tardy and 
expensive in every point of view, subjected us to be 
beaten in detail. 

It will depend upon your Excellency, therefore, to 
terminate the war, and enable the allies to dictate the 
law in a treaty. A campaign so glorious and so fertile 
in consequences could be reserved only for the Count 
de Grasse. It rarely happens, that such a combination 
of means, as are in our hands at present, can be 
seasonably obtained by the most strenuous human ex- 
ertions ; a decisively superior fleet, the fortune and 
talents of whose commander overawe all the naval 
force, that the most strenuous efforts of the enemy have 
been able to collect ; an army flushed with success, 
demanding only to be conducted to new attacks ; and 
the very season, which is proper for operating against 
the points in question. 

If, upon entering into the detail of this expedition, 
your Excellency should determine it impracticable, 
there is an object, which, though subordinate to that 
above mentioned, is of capital importance to our south- 
ern operations, and may be eflected at infinitely less 
expense; I mean the enemy's post at Wilmington in 
North Carolina. Circumstances require that I should 
at this period reinforce the southern army under Gen- 
eral Greene. This reinforcement, transported by sea 
ander your convoy, would enable us to carry the post

in question with very little dilliculty, and would wrest 
Ironi the British a point of support in North Carolina, 
which is attended with the most dangerous consequen- 
ces to us, and liberate another State. Tiiis object 
would require nothing more than the convoy of your 
fleet to the point of operation, and the protection of 
the debarkation. 

I entreat your Excellency's attention to the points, 
which I have the honor of laying before you, and that 
you will be pleased at the same time to inform me 
what are your dispositions for a maritime force to be 
left on the American station. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.* 



• The day after the above letter was written, General Wasliington 
himself went on board the admiral's ship, botli to pay liis respects and 
offer his thanks for the services that had been rendered by the fleet, and 
to endeavour to impress upon Count de Grasse tlie importance of the 
plan he had siifrn;cstcd. lie returned the same eveninj^s but, liaving 
promised to Lafayette the command of the detachment destined against 
Wilmington, in case Count de Grasse could be persuaded to undertake 
the convoy and debarkation of the troops, he letl that officer on board 
the Ville de Paris for the purpose of further consultation with the ad- 
miral. Two days afterwards Lafayette also came back, and made the 
following report. 

" The Count de Grasse would be happy to be able to make the ex- 
pedition to Cliarleston, all the advantages of which he feels; but tlie 
orders of his court, ulterior projects, and his engagemenU with the 
Spaniards, render it impossible to remain here the necessary time for this 
operation. His wish to serve the United States is such, that he desires 
to enter into engagements for a cooperation during the next campaign, 
as far as the plans of the court will permit. The expedition to Wil- 
mington requiring less time, the Count de Grasse would undertake to 
conduct to that place a detachment of two thousand .\mericans. As to 
the manner of operating, it must be determined according to the particu- 
lar information, that we shall collect. It will be necessary immediately 
to have pilots, persons well acquainted witli the country, with whom the 
Count de Grasse would desire to converse as soon as possible, in order 
to give his answer definitely. The American troops must be furnished 
with their own provisions, the naval anny having none to spare. The 
Count de Grasse gives us leave to make use of the vessels in York 
River. The Loyalist, the Queen Charlotte, and the Cormorant have been

Sir, 
As the transmission of the enclosed paper, through 
the usual channel of the department of foreign af- 
fairs, would on the present occasion probably be at- 
tended with great delay, and recent intelligence of 
military transactions must be important to our minis- 
ters in Europe, at the present period of affairs, I 
have thought it would be agreeable both to Congress 
and to your Excellency, that the matter should be 
communicated immediately by a French fi-igate de- 
spatched by Count de Grasse. Annexed to the ca- 
pitulation is a summary return of the prisoners and 
cannon taken in the two places of York and Glouces- 
ter. I have added, upon the principles above men- 
tioned, an extract from General Greene's report of his 
last action in South Carolina.

sold to the State of Virginia, but the Count de Grasse does not think 
he will be able to embark the American troops on board his ships of 
the line. How then shall we provide sailors to man the other vessels ? 
The count has fifteen American sailors. There are some small armed 
vessels. 

" If, after having seen the persons acquainted with the coast, the Count 
de Grasse thinks he shall be able to take the troops on board his line- 
of-baltle ships, and debark them without danger, then it will be useless 
to take the transports. If frigates can run into a convenient place, tiien 
the troops will be embarked on board of frigates. The day of departure 
is to be the first of November, or if possible sooner." 

* A copy of this letter was sent to Mr. Jay in Spain, and to Mr. 
Adams in Holland. Dr. Franklin replied as follows. " I received duly 
the honor of your letter, accompanying the capitulation of General 
Cornwallis. All the world agree, that no expedition was ever better 
planned or better executed. It has made a great addition to the military 
reputation you had already acquired, and brightens the glory that sur- 
rounds your name, and that must accompany it to our latest posterity.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Uoad-Ciuarlere, 20 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do mv.>^eir the honor to enclose to your Excellency 
copies of returns of prisoners, arms, artillery, ordnance, 
and other stores surrendered by the enemy in their 
posts of York and Gloucester on the 19th instant, 
which were not completed at the time of my last 
despatches, and are but this moment handed to me. 
A draft of these posts, with the plan of attack and 
defence, is also transmitted, ami twenty-four standards 
taken at the same time are ready to be laid before 
Con2;ress. 

Our operations against the enemy in this State being 
concluded, it becomes my duty to inform Congress 
of the disposition I have made for the future destina- 
tion of the troops under my command. The Penn- 
sylvania, Maryland, and Virginia Continental troops 
are ordered as a reinforcement to the ai'my under 

No news could possibly make me more happy. The infant Herculea

The "two serpents" were the armies of Burgoyne and Cornwallis. 
A medal containing this device was afterwards struck by the direction 
of Dr. Franklin. — Diplomatic Correspondence, Vol. III. p. 308. 

In the General Orders, issued the day after the capitulation, high 
praise was awarded both to the French and American officers and troops 
for their conduct during the siege. These orders, as contained in the 
Remembrancer (Vol. XIII. p. 62), differ widely from the original. They 
■were probably retranslated from the French. The following is the 
closing part of the original orders, as taken from tlie Orderly Book, 

" Divine service is to be performed to-morrow in tlie several brigades 
and divisions. The Commander-in-chief earnestly recommends, that 
the troops not on duty should universally attend, with that seriousness 
of deportment and gratitude of heart, which the recognition of such 
reiterated and astonishing interpositions of Providence demands of us."

General Greene. I shall myself, with the troops of 
the States to the northward of Pennsylvania, return 
to my former position on the North River and the 
communications with it. The first mentioned division, 
composing a body of two thousand men, under the 
du-ection of the Marquis de Lafayette, will, on their 
way to South Carolina, make an expedition against 
the enemy's posts at Wilmington in North Carolina. 
To effect which purpose, they will be transported to 
a proper point of debarkation, under convoy of the 
Count de Grasse, who encourages me, if circumstan- 
ces and the situation of the water will admit, to give 
them his cooperation, so long as shall be necessary to 
accomplish, by a coup de main, their object at Wilming- 
ton. Immediately upon the reduction of that post, the 
troops will proceed to join General Greene. 

That I may not, from the above arrangement, incur 
the censure of Congress, or the States, who may have 
flattered themselves with an expectation of my push- 
ing my operations further southward than this State ; 
in justice to my own endeavours, and for the satisfac- 
tion of Congress, I find myself obliged to transmit to 
your Excellency a summary of reasons, which have 
induced my determination. In doing which, I take 
the liberty to submit to Congress copies of two propo- 
sitions, which I have had the honor to make to Count 
de Grasse, with his answers to each. The first, which 
was made immediately on my arrival at Williamsburg, 
and is dated the 18th of September, will show, that 
other objects than the reduction of the British force 
under the command of Lord Cornwallis were early in 
my contemplation, and will also declare what were 
at that time the sentiments of the French admiral. 
The second proposition, made after the surrender of 
the British army, will evince with how much reluc-

tance 1 was brought to relinquish a further prosecution 
of favorite views. In addition to these two communi- 
cations, Congress will scarcely need to be informed, 
that, having no means of water conveyance, the trans- 
portation, by land, of the ai-my, with all their baggage, 
artillery, ordnance stores, and every appai-atus neces- 
sary for the siege of Charleston, would be impractica- 
ble, and attended with such immense troui)le, e.\pense, 
and delay, as would (exclusive of the necessity of 
naval cooperation) be suflicient to deter me from the 
undertaking ; especially as the enemy, after regaining 
the naval superiority on this coast, could reinforce or 
withdraw the garrison at pleasure. 

The prosecution, therefore, of the southern war, upon 
that broad scale which I had wished, being as I judge 
to be relinquished, nothing remained in my opinion 
more eligible, than to reinforce General Greene's army 
to such a state of respectability, as that he might be 
able to command the country of South Carolina, and 
at the same time, if possible, by that reinforcement to 
effect an accomplishment of the smaller object men- 
tioned ; and to march myself, with the remainder of 
' the army, to the Nortli River, where they would be 
ready at the ensuing campaign to commence such 
operations against ISew York, as may be hereafter 
concerted, or to effect any other purposes that may 
be judged practicable or eligible. Add to these rea- 
sons, that Count de Rochaml)eau, from the exhausted 
state of his stores and other considerations, seemed 
inclined to take his resolution to remain in this State 
with his troops for the winter, at any rate six weeks 
to refresh them. Upon a full consideration of the 
reasons offered, I flatter myself, that my conduct will 
stand approved in the judgment of Congi'ess, whose 
approbation I shall ever be solicitous to obtain. 



192 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 49. 

I enclose, also, for the observation of Congress, a 
copy of my letter to the ministers of the United States 
at the courts of Europe, conveying to them the intelli- 
gence of our success in this State against the British 
troops. The reasons for this conduct, as stated in that 
letter, I must rely upon, as my justification with Con- 
gress for the hberty taken by me in that communica- 
tion. 

Unacquainted with the state of politics between 
Congress and the courts of Europe respecting future 
negotiations, whatever our prospects from that quarter 
may be, I cannot justify myself to my own mind 
without urging Congress in the warmest terms to make 
every arrangement for an early and efficacious cam- 
paign the ensuing year, that may be found necessary. 
Arguments, I flatter myself, need not be adduced to 
unpress on Congress the high importance of this idea. 
Whatever may be the events of the coming winter 
or ensuing summer, an effectual and early preparation 
for mihtary operations will put us upon the most respec- 
table footing, either for war or negotiation ; while a re- 
laxation will place us in a disreputable situation in point 
of peaceful prospects, and will certainly expose us to 
the most disgraceful disasters, in case of a continuance 
of the hostile disposition of our enemies. 

Nothing is yet heard of Admiral Digby, with his 
fleet, near these coasts. Whatever his intentions may 
be, Count de Grasse, I believe, is ready to meet him. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

P. S. October 29th. In the moment of closing my 
despatch, I am favored with the definitive determina- 
tion of the Count de Grasse respecting the troops, 
whom I hoped to have transported to Wilmington by 
water. His ideas are communicated in his letter to

the Martinis dc Lali\yctte, a copy of which I transmit 
hcrewilli.* In consequence of this rcsohition, and hav- 
ing no transports, I am obliged to send on the troops 
destined for tlie southern district liy land. They will 
commence their march in a few days, under the com- 
mand of Major-Gcneral St. Clair. The command of 
the expedition against Wilmington had been promised 
to the Marquis, upon the contingency of the troops 
being transported by water. On the failure ol' this 
event, the Marquis does not proceed with the reinforce- 
ment. My present despatch being important, I have 
committed it to the care of Colonel Humphreys, one 
of my aids-dc-camp, whom for his attention, fidelity, 
and good services, I beg leave to recommend to the 
notice of Congress and your Excellency. 

• Count de Grasse to Lafayette. — "Tlie more I reflect on the plan 
which you mentioned to me, the more I see the impossibility of under- 
taking to transport troops, baggage, artillery, and ammunition. My ul- 
terior operations require my return to an appointed place at a fixed day. 
That day approaches, and it would be impossible for me to break my 
engagement voluntarily. The passage from hence to Cape Fear may 
possibly be accomplished in two days, but it may also require more than 
fifteen. The debarkation of troops and stores may be attended with 
delays, and expose me to censure. Besides, it might happen, tliat, from 
an obstinate succession of southerly winds, I should be obliged to take 
the resolution of repairing to my rendezvous. Then I should be under 
the necessity of carrj-ing with me, during the whole campaign, a detach- 
ment of troops useful to the Continent, of which I should be very sorry 
to depnve it Thus, all that I can do, is to promise to escort as well 
OS I can tlie vessels, that may have troops on board ; but it will be 
impossible for me to remain on tlie coast beyond the 8th of next month ; 
and even this delay must be repaired on my part by the greatest activity. 
If you ore deficient in the means of embarking or debarking, let us 
think no more of the measure. But do not attribute my refusal to any 
tiling, but the impossibility of executing a matter that was agreeable 
to you." — MS. Letter, October 26<A. 

A long letter was likewise written by Count de Grasse to General 
Washington on tlie subject, stating the same objections, and expressing 
his regret, that the orders he was bound to follow, and the engagements 
he had made to be in the West Indies, prevented liim from cooperating 
in this enterprise, which held out the fairest prospects of success.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Camp, near York, 26 October, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
In answer to yours of the 24th, I beg leave to in- 
form you, that as no immediate operation requires 
your presence in this country, I shall most cheerfully 
second your application to Congress for a six months' 
furlough for yourself and Colonel Gouvion, for the 
purpose of ai-ranging yom- private aflairs in France. 
The other request * appears to me to involve diffi- 
culties, that will deprive me of the pleasure, which, 
from a sense of your merit, I should feel on every 
possible occasion in promoting your views. In the 
present instance, the infringement of the rights of 
seniority in so many individuals, and the pretensions 
of some, who have particular claims upon their coun- 
try, convince me that your desires could not be ac- 
complished but at the expense of the tranquillity of 
the army. I cannot forbear adding at the same time, 
that it will always afford me the greatest pleasure to 
give the most particular testimony of the zeal, talents, 
and distinguished services of yourself and Colonel 
Gouvion ; and I entreat you to be persuaded of my 
earnest wish, that you may receive, at a more con- 
venient opportunity, those rewards from Congi'ess, 
which you deserve. I am, &,c.t 

* That Washington should encourage his application to Congress for 
promotion to the rank of major-general. 

t In reply General Duportail said, that he was fully aware of the diffi- 
culties here stated, that it was not his desire or intention to interfere with 
the claims of other officers, but that he considered his case a peculiar one. 
He had come to America at the request of Congress, and served during 
the whole war, and thus thrown himself out of the line of promotion in 
the French army. He requested, that General Washington would not at 
any rate oppose his application to Congress. It will be seen hereafter, 
that this request was more tlian complied with, on the part of the 
Commander-in-chief

TO THE PRKSinENT AXD PROFESSORS OF THE 
L'MVERSITY OF WILLIAM AXD MARY. 

27 October, 1781. 
GENTLEMEy, 

I accept very kindly the address of the President 
and Professors of the University of William and ^Fary. 
The reduction of the British force in this State, for 
which I feel myself highly indebted to the noble ex- 
ertions of our brave and generous allies, is a circum- 
stance which gives me great pleasure, not only as it 
aflfords a return of peaceful security to many of my 
fellow citizens, but as it will, I hope, in its event be 
productive of more extensive good consequences. The 
seat of literature at Williamsburg has ever in my view- 
been an object of veneration. As an institution im- 
portant for its communication of useful learning, and 



196 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

conducive to the diffusion of the true principles of 
rational liberty, you may be assured, that it shall 
receive every encouragement and benefaction in my 
power towards its recstabhshment. 

The sick and wounded of the army, whom my 
necessities have compelled me to trouble you with, shall 
be removed as soon as circumstances will pei-mit, an 
event which will be as pleasing to me, as agreeable to 
you. I am, &c. 



TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Head-Quarters, 28 October, 1781. 

Sir, 
Your Excellency did me the honor to mention, in 
one of your letters, and subsequently in the note trans- 
mitted by the Marquis de Lafayette, that, from a de- 
su-e to serve the United States, your Excellency would 
enter into engagements for such cooperations the next 
campaign as should not be incompatible with the orders 
of your court. This offer is too essential to the in- 
terests of the common cause, not to be embraced by 
me with the greatest eagerness, while it claims my 
warmest acknowledgments for the continuance of your 
friendly disposition towards America. As it is im- 
possible, at this distance of time, to determine whether 
it will be most advantageous for the allies to open the 
campaign with the siege of New York, and thence 
proceed to that of Charleston, or make Charleston 
the leading operation, I take the liberty of proposing 
to your Excellency the following general dispositions, 
as equally applicable to either ; namely, that your 
Excellency would assemble a decisive naval superi- 
ority in the Bay of Chesapeake, towards the end of 



PiRTll.] Tin; A.MKRICAN RKVULUTION. 197 

Miiy, from which central position \vc niiylit easily 
transport ourselves for a reunion of our means against 
whichever of the niiu-itime points above mentioned cir- 
cumstances should render it most advisable to attack 
first. With your Excellency, I need not insist either 
upon the indispeusahle necessity of a maritime force 
capable of giving you an absolute ascendency in these 
seas, nor enlarge upon the advantages, which must be 
derived from anticipating the British in opening the 
campaign, next to the immediate prosecution of our 
present successes with the union of superior means 
now in our power, and which would infallibly termi- 
nate the war at one stroke. 

Tlie plan, which I have the honor to submit to your 
Excellency, is that which appears to me most likely to 
accomplish the great objects of the alliance. You will 
have observed, that, whatever eflbrts are made by the 
land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in 
the present contest. The court of France are con- 
vinced of it, and have declared their resolution to give 
this indispensable succour. The triumphant manner 
in which your Excellency has maintained the mastery 
of the American seas, and the glory of the French 
flag, lead both nations to look to you as the arbiter 
of the war. Public and private motives make me most 
ardendy wisli, that the next campaign may be Circulated 
to crown all your former victories. I entreat your 
Excellency to be persuaded of my regard for your glo- 
ry, and of the sincere friendship with which I shall in- 
variably continue, my dear General, &-c.*

General Washington's proposal to tlie French court, and doubted not 
that every thing in their powf-r would be done to promote his views, 
and establish American liberty. St. Simon embarked his troops, and

TO MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

The detachment, of which you wUl have the com- 
mand, for the southward is to consist of the Pennsyl- 
vania, Maryland, and Virginia Continental troops. You 
will march them by the most convenient route, and in 
the most expeditious manner, without fatiguing the 
troops, towards Wilmington in North Carolina, or other 
posts in that State ; of which you will endeavour to 
dispossess the enemy, if their situation, from the in- 
telligence you shall receive as you advance, shall in 
your judgment render it practicable and advisable. If 
it does not, you will continue your march to the south- 
eiTi army, and put yourself under the command of 
Major-General Greene. 

As Wilmington and other places in North Carolina 
may cease to be objects, from a change of circum- 
stances in the States to the southward of this, it will 
be necessary for you to open an immediate communi- 
cation by letter with General Greene, and govern your- 
self by his advice and orders ; and it may be well to 
communicate, in confidence, to the Executive of the 
State of North Carolina the enterprise against Wilming- 
ton, that you may procure such information and aid 
as it may be in their power to give. For ordnance 
and stores, and for the means of transportation and 
other matters in the quartermaster's department, you 
will consult General Knox and Colonel Pickering, and 
win make your arrangements with the commissary, or 

West Indies. General Washington presented to Count de Grasse two 
horses, which were sent off to the fleet. 

The French army remained in Virginia till the following summer. 
The head-quarters of Count de Rochambeau were at Williamsburg.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

All the troops, who are about to return to the north- 
ward, will be under your command ; and I entreat you 
to use every means in your power to hasten them 
forward by land or water, or partly by both, as cir- 
cumstances may requu'e. The ordnance, and stores 
of every kind, must be despatched, or in such train 
for it as to need no further cover or aid from the troops, 
ere they can move from their present encampment. 
The ordnance vessels, and vessels carrying stores of 
every other kind, should receive of sick, invalids, and 
weak men, as mimy as they can transport with safety 
and convenience ; after whicli, if there is not water 
transportation for the remainder, they must be marched 
by land, on the route by which the cavalry and teams 
came from the Head of Elk to this place. 

For the reputation of the troops, and preservation of 
property, you will use your utmost exertions to pre- 
vent any species of abuse on the march. Destruction 
of fences is too often among the wanton ijijuries, which 



200 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

are committed. A few axes, and strict attention of the 
officers, will infallibly prevent this, and I trust it will 
be done. You will be able, after informing yourself 
of the extent of the water transportation, to determine 
on the number of men, who must march by land, 
and make your arrangements with the quartermaster- 
general accordingly. If there are any men upon de- 
tachment, they are to be called in and marched with 
their regiments. A sufficient number of officers must 
be left to take forward the sick and invalids, as fast 
as they recover. Some good field-officer should remain 
to superintend this business. Given at Head-Quarters,

Dear Sir, 
I have to acknowledge your Excellency's two fa-

you express your sentiments on a subject of so much 
importance to yourself in particular, and to the gen- 
eral interest of the United States.f I have only to la- 

* Tlie troops were transported by water to the Head of Elk, and they 
marched thence by land. The New Jersey troops were stationed for the 
winter near Morristown, and the two New York regiments, under Gen- 
eral James Clinton, at Pompton. All the others proceeded to the North 
River, where the light companies joined their -respective regiments. 
Hazen's regiment was ordered to Lancaster in Pennsylvania. 

The British prisoners were marched to Winchester in Virginia, and 
to Port Frederic and Fredericktown in Maryland. The barracks at 
Fort Frederic were found to be in such a state of decay, that the division 
of the prisoners intended for that place was stationed at Fredericktown. 
As these prisoners were guarded only by militia, many differences oc- 
curred, and occasionally serious quarrels, between them and the in- 
habitants ; and they were subsequently removed to Lancaster, in Penn- 
sylvania, and guarded by Continental troops.

iHL'ut, tliiit ii is not in my power to give you that sat- 
isfactory reply, which your forul liopes would lead you 
to expect. I can assure you, that every argument has 
been used with the Count de CJrasse to induce him to 
continue his stay on these coasts, and to aid with his 
lleet the combineti army in an operation against Ciiarles- 
ton ; hut without success. The advanced season, the 
orders of his court, and liis own engagements to be 
punctual to a certain time fixed upon for his ultenor 
operations, forbid a compliance on his part, and I am 
obliged to submit. 

An attempt to besiege Charleston, without the aid 
of a superior naval force, being utterly impracticable, a 
very respectable reinforcement of Continental troops is 
ordered for the support of General Greene; with which 
I flatter myself he will be able to command the coun- 
try of South Carolina, and confine the enemy to the 
town of Charleston ; and I fancy to myself a future 
day, not far distant, w hen tliey will be obliged to aban- 
don that place. As you will, before this can reach you, 
be fully informed of our success against Earl Cornwal- 
lis, 1 omit to add any thing on that subject, but beg 
your Excellency to accept my sincere congratulations 
on that favorable event. I am, dear Sir, &,c.* 

• The Virginia militia at the siege of Yorktown were commanded by 
General Nelson, at that time governor of the State. Tlie following an- 
ecdotes were related to me by General Ijafayotto. 

When the cannon were prepared for bombarding the town, Governor 
Nelson was requested to direct the pointing of them to those parts where 
they would do the greatest execution. He showed to the officers a 
large house, which was a conspicuous object, and which he said was 
probably Uie head-quarters. He advised them to aim at that house. It 
proved to be his own. This evidence of patriotism was regarded witli 
high admiration by the French officers. 

Before Uie siege of Yorktown commenced, the public treasury of Vir- 
ginia was without money, and there was danger that the militia would 
disband for the want of pay. Governor Nelson applied to a wealthy per- 
son to borrow money on the credit of the State. But the public affairs

202 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, near York, 31 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor of transmitting to your Ex- 
cellency a letter from General Duportail, in which he 
explains the motives of an intended application to Con- 
gress for permission to go to France, and for the pro- 
motion of himself and other officers of his corps. 1 
should conceal sentiments, with which I am very strong- 
ly impressed, and do injustice to very conspicuous 
merit, if I did not upon the present occasion offer my 
testimony to the distinguished abilities and services, 
both of General Duportail and Colonel Gouvion. Their 
claim to the particular attention of Congress at this 
juncture is founded upon the practice of Europe ; 
sieges being considered as the particular province of 
the corps of engineers, and as entitling them, when 
attended with a success important in itself and its 
consequences, to the great military rewards. These 
officers, besides, are supported by a series of conduct 
in the line of their department, which makes them not 
depend merely upon the present circumstances. 

For these reasons, I am induced to recommend Gen- 
eral Duportail's memorial to Congress for the promo- 
tions which he specifies, and the leave of absence ; the 
latter being by no means incompatible with the good 
of the service at the present period, as I am reduced, 
notwithstanding all my efforts, to the necessity of re- 
tiring into winter-quarters. The same principles as 
those above mentioned forbid me to be silent on the 
subject of General Knox, who is closely united with 

were then in so precarious a condition, and the prospects so uncertain, 
that the money-holder refused to lend on such security. Governor Nel- 
son then offered his own property as a pledge, which was accepted, and 
the loan was obtained.

TO Tin: MAU<iUIS de lafayette. 

Mount Vernon, Virginia, 15 November, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 
Not till the 5th instant was I able to leave York. 
Engaged in providing for the detachment that was to 
go southerly, embarking the troops that were to pro- 

• Certiftcale. — " General Duportail, commandant of the corps of engi- 
neers, having signified his desire of obtaining leave to go to France for 
the arrangement of his domestic affairs, it is with the greatest satisfac- 
tion I embrace this opportunity of testifying tlie sense, which I entertain 
of his distinguished talents and services. His judgment in council and 
well-conducted valor in the field claim the highest applause, and have se- 
cured to him the esteem and confidence of the army. His plan and con- 
duct of tlie attacks in the late important and successful siege of York, 
where he commanded tlie corps of engineers, afford brilliant proofs of 
his military genius, and set the seal to his reputation ; wliile they en- 
title him to my warmest thanks. Given at Head-Quarters, 3l8t Octo- 
ber, 1781." 

General Duportail was promoted, on the 16th of November, according 
to the above recommendation, but General Knox was passed over. There 
was a serious difficulty in the case, owing to tlie local partiality of some of 
the members of Congress, and to the opinion of others that general prin- 
ciples should be adhered to. The commission of Knox as brigadier 
bore a subsequent date to those of James Clinton, Moultrie, and M<"In- 
tosh. The members from New York, South Carolina, and Georgia would 
not agree to the promotion of Knox, unless those officers were promoted 
at the same time ; and a vote for the whole could not be carried. Sev- 
eral trials were made, and General Washington was consulted on the

ceed northerly, making a distribution of the ordnance 
and stores for various purposes, and disposing of the 
officers and other prisoners to their respective places 
of destination, I could not leave that part of the coun- 
try sooner. 

On that day I arrived at Eltham, the seat of Colonel 
Bassett, time enough to see poor Mr. Custis bi'eathe 
his last. This unexpected and affecting event threw 
Mrs. Washington and Mrs. Custis, who were both pres- 
ent, into such deep distress, that the circumstance of 
it, and a duty I owed the deceased in assisting at his 
funeral, prevented my reaching this place till the 13th; 
and business here and on the road will put it out of 
my power to arrive at Philadelphia before the last days 
of the present month. 

As this may extend to a later period than your busi- 
ness in that city may require, I owe it to your friend- 
ship and to my affectionate regard for you, my dear 
Marquis, not to let you leave this country, without car- 
rying with you fresh marks of my attachment to you, 

Bubject after his arrival in Philadelphia. To Mr. Bee, a delegate from 
South Carolina, he wrote as follows, on the 8th of March. 

"I am clearly of opinion, for reasons which I had the honor of detail- 
ing to you yesterday, that the promotion of General Knox singly will in- 
volve fewer disagreeable consequences, than any other method, which I 
have yet heard proposed ; for I am persuaded that no oiBcer, senior to 
himself, as well acquainted as I am with his e.xtraordinary exertions to 
prepare without proper means the siege-artillery for the last campaign, 
the despatch with which he transported it, and his uncommon assiduity 
and good management of it at YorlUown, would think his promotion an 
improper reward, or any reflection upon his own merit. If e.xtraordinary 
exertions do not meet with particular attention, there is no stimulus to 
action, and an ofScer has little more to do than to steer clear of courts- 
martial." 

The representations of the Commander-in-chief at last prevailed, and, 
on the 2'2d of March, Knox was promoted to the rank of major-general, 
and his commission was ordered to be dated on the 15th of the pre- 
ceding November, thereby giving bun precedence of General Duportail, 
and advancing him over the abovementioned brigadiers.

and new expressions of the high sense I entertain of 
your military conduct and other important services in 
the course of the last campaign, although the latter are 
too well known to need the testimony of my approba- 
tion, and the former I persuade myself you believe is 
too well riveted to undergo diminution or change. 

As you expressed a desire to know ray sentiments 
respecting the operations of the next campaign, before 
your departure foi' France, I will without a tedious dis- 
play of reasoning declare in one word, that the advan- 
tages of it to America, and the honor and glory of it to 
the allied arms in these States, must depend absolutely 
upon the naval force, which is employed in these seas, 
luul the time of its appearance next yeai-. No land 
force can act decisively, unless it is accompanied by a 
maritime superiority ; nor can more than negative ad- 
vantages be expected without it. For proof of this, 
we have only to recur to the instances of the ease and 
facility with which the British shifted their ground, as 
advantages were to be obtained at either extremity of 
the continent, and to their late heavy loss the moment 
they failed in their naval superiority. To point out the 
further advantages, which might have been obtained in 
the course of this year, if Count de Grasse could have 
waited, and would have covered a further operation to 
the southward, is unnecessary ; because a doubt did 
not exist, nor does it at this moment, in any man's 
mind, of the total extirpation of the British force in 
the Carolinas and Georgia, if he could have extended 
his cociperation two months longer. 

It follows then as certain as night succeeds the day, 
that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing 
definitive, and with it every thing honorable and glo- 
rious. A constant naval superiority would terminate 
the war speedily ; without it, I do not know that it w ill 

VOL. VIII. R 



206 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

ever be terminated honorably. If this force should ap- 
pear early, we shall have the whole campaign before 
us. The months from June to September inclusive are 
well adapted for operating in any of the States to the 
northwai'd of this ; and the remaining months are 
equally well suited to those south ; in which time, with 
such means, I think much, I will add every thing, 
might be expected. 

How far the policy of Congress may carry them 
towards filling their Continental battalions does not lie 
with me to determine. This measure, before and since 
the capitulation, has been strongly recommended by 
me. Should it be adopted by that body, and executed 
with energy in the several States, I think our force, 
comprehending the auxiliary troops now here, will be 
fully competent to all the purposes of the American 
war, provided the British force on this continent re- 
mains nearly as it now is. But this is a contingency, 
which depends very much upon political manoeuvres in 
Europe ; and, as it is uncertain how far we may be in 
a state of preparation at the opening of the next cam- 
paign, the propriety of augmenting the present army 
under the command of Count de Rochambeau is a 
question worthy of consideration ; but, as it lies with 
Congress to determine, I shall be silent on the subject. 
If I should be deprived of the pleasure of a per- 
sonal interview with you before your departure, per- 
mit me to adopt this method of making you a tender 
of my ardent vows for a propitious voyage, a gracious 
reception from your prince, an honorable reward for 
your services, a happy meeting with your lady and 
fiiends, and a safe return in the spring to, my dear 
Marquis, your affectionate friend, &c.*

Sir, 
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor of the 31st ultimo, covering the resolutions of 
Congress of the 29lh, anil a proclamation for a day of 
public prayer and thanksgiving, and have to thank you, 
Sir, most sincerely for the very polite and affectionate 

cort to the troops, Lafayette resolved to return to France. The season 
being too far advanced to admit of any further active service till the next 
year, he was desirous of taking this opportunity to visit his family. With 
the approbation of General Washington he proceeded to Philadelphia, 
and Conirress granted him permission of absence for such a period as he 
should think proper. Resolves were at tlie same time passed highly com- 
plimentary to his character, his zeal, and military conduct, particularly 
during the last campaign. Among other resolves were the following. 

" That the secretary of foreign affairs acquaint the ministers pleni- 
potentiary of the United States, that it is the desire of Congress tJiat 
they confer with the Marquis de Lafayette, and avail themselves of his 
information relative to the situation of public affairs in the United States. 

" That the secretary of foreign affairs further acquaint the minister 
plenipotentiary at the court of Versailles, that he will conform to tlie 
intention of Congress by consulting with and employing the assistance 
of the Marquis de Lafayette in accelerating the supplies, which may be 
afforded by his Most Christian Majesty for the use of the United States." 
— Journals, .Yovember 23(/. 

The superintendent of finance wa.s likewise ordered to furnish him 
■with a proper conveyance to France. 

In a letter from Congress to the King of France, of which Lafayette 
was the bearer, he was also commended to the notice of his sovereign 
in very warm terms. Secret Journal, Vol. IIL pp. 48, 52. — Diplomatic 
Correspondence, Vol. X. p. 5.

these testimonies of their esteem and confidence, may be seen in the

manner in which these enclosures have been conveyed. 
The success of the combined arms against our enemies 
at York and Gloucester, as it affects the welfare and 
independence of the United States, I viewed as a most 
fortunate event. In performing my part towards its ac- 
complishment, I consider myself to have done only my 
duty, and in the execution of that I ever feel myself 
happy ; and at the same time, as it augurs well to our 
cause, I take a particular pleasure in acknowledging, 
that the interposing hand of Heaven, m the various in- 
stances of our extensive preparations for this operation, 
has been most conspicuous and remarkable. 

After the receipt of your favor, I received official 
information through the secretary of Congress, of the 
new choice of their president. While I congratulate 

necessary preparations, he went to Boston, where a frigate to take him 
on board awaited liis arrival.

It was not only in America, but in his own country, and by the King's 
ministers, that Lafayette was praised for the manner in which he had 
conducted the Virginia campaign. 

" We have learned with great pleasure," said Count de Vergennes in 
writing to him, " that, notwithstanding you have not had the direction 
in chief of this grand operation [the siege of Yorktown], yet your pru- 
dent conduct and preliminary manceuvres prepared the way for success. 
I followed you step by step through your whole campaign in Virginia, 
and should often have trembled for you, if I had not been confident in 
your wisdom. It requires no common ability and skill to enable a man 
to sustain himself as you have done, and during so long a time, before 
such a general as Lord Cornwallis, who is lauded for his talents in war ; 
and this, too, with a great disproportion in your forces. It was you, who 
conducted him to his fatal destination, wliere, instead of making you 
prisoner, as he had predicted, he was reduced to the necessity of sur- 
rendering himself in that cliaracter." — -W,S. Letter, Versailles, Decem-

Gentlemen, 

I accept with peculiar satisfaction the very kind and 
affectionate address of the citizens of Alexandria. The 
long experience, which in former times I have had of 
their sincerity and cordiality, stamps it with particular 
value ; and permit me to say, that, to make a peaceful 
return to this agreeable society of my fellow citizens, 
is among the most ardent of my wishes, and would 
prove my greatest comfort for all the toils and vicissi- 
tudes, which I have experienced during my absence. 

The great Director of events has carried us through 
a variety of scenes, during this long and bloody con- 
test, in which we have been for seven campaigns most 
nobly struggling. The present prospect is pleasing. 
The late success at Yorktown is very promising, but 
on our own improvement of it depend its future good 
consequences. A vigorous prosecution of this success

Your condolence for the loss of that amiable youth,

Gentlemen, 

I very sensibly feel the honor, which has this day 
been conferred upon me by the vote of thanks of so 
respectable a body, as that of the General Assembly of 
the State of Maryland. The regard, which they have 
been pleased to express for me personally, the delicate 
manner in which they have recalled to view those dis- 
tant events, which in some degree led to our present 
happy situation, and the general approbation, which 
they have generously bestowed upon the whole of my 
conduct, must ever secure to them my warmest es- 
teem, and must at the same time operate as fresh in- 
centives to merit their future good opinion. 

* Mr. Custis was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. 



PartII.] TIIL; AMERICAN RKVOLUTION. '211 

It is with the highest degree of pleasure I observe, 
that a proper allowance lias been made lor the capital 
share, which the land and sea forces of our great and 
good ally had in the reduction of the common enemy 
at York in Virginia. I should deem myself unpardon- 
able, were I not upon every occasion, more especially 
upon such a one as the present, to declare, that to the 
sound counsels and vigorous exertions of their Excel- 
lencies Count de Rochambcau and Count de Grasse 
much, very much, was owing. 

While I agi-ee in sentiment with the honorable bodies 
over which you preside, that we may entertain a ra- 
tional ground of belief, that, under the favor of Divine 
Providence, the freedom, independence, and happiness 
of America will shortly be established upon the surest 
foundation, I think it a duty incumbent upon me to 
observe, that those most desirable objects are not to 
be fully attained but by a continuance of those exer- 
tions, which have already so greatly humbled the power 
of our inveterate enemies. Relaxation upon our part 
will give them time to recollect and recover them- 
selves ; whereas a vigorous prosecution of the war must 
inevitably crush their remaining force in these States, 
or put them to the necessity of entirely withdrawing 
themselves. 

I cannot conclude without expressing my warmest 
wishes for the prosperity of a State, which has ever 
stood among the foremost in her support of the com- 
mon cause. I confess myself under particular obliga- 
tions for the ready attention, which I have ever expe- 
rienced to those requisitions, which, in the course of 
my duty, I have occasionally been under the necessity 
of making. I have the honor to be, &,c.*

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Philadelphia, 28 November, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the 
6th instant, and to thank your Excellency with great 
sincerity for the very cordial and affectionate congratu- 
lations, which you are pleased to express on our late 
success in Vii'ginia. 

I most earnestly hope, that this event may be pro- 
ductive of the happy consequences you mention ; and 
I think that its good effects cannot fail to be very ex- 
tensive, unless, from a mistaken idea of the magnitude 
of this success, unhappily a spirit of remissness should 
seize the minds of the States, and they should set 

hall by two members. He was addressed by the president as follows. 

" Sir ; Congress, at all times happy in seeing your Excellency, feel 
particular pleasure in your presence at this time, after the glorious suc- 
cess of the allied arms in Virginia. It is their fixed purpose to draw 
every advantage from it, by exhorting the States in tlie strongest terms 
to the most vigorous and timely exertions. A committee has accordingly 
been appointed to state the requisitions necessary to be made for the 
establishment of the army, and they are instructed to confer with you 
upon that subject. It is, therefore, the expectation of Congress, that your 
Excellency would remain for some time in Philadelphia, that they may 
avail themselves of your aid in this important business, and that you may 
enjoy a respite from the fatigues of war, as far as is consistent with the 
service." 

To this address General Washington replied ; 

" Mr. President ; I feel very sensibly the favorable declaration of Con- 
gress expressed by your Excellency. This fresh proof of their approba- 
tion cannot fail of making a deep impression upon me ; and my study 
shall be to deserve a continuance of it. It is with peculiar pleasure I 
hear, that it is the fixed purpose of Congress to exhort the States to the 
most vigorous and timely exertions. A compliance on their part will, I 
persuade myself, be productive of the most happy consequences. I shall 
yield a ready obedience to tlie expectation of Congress, and give every 
assistance in my power to their committee. I am obliged by the good- 
ness of Congress in making my personal ease and convenience a part 
of their concern. Should the service require my attendance with the 
army upon the North River, or elsewhere, I shall repair to whatever 
place my duty calls, with the same pleasure that I remain in this city."

themselves down in quiet with a delusive hope of the 
contest being brought to a close. 1 iiope tliis may not 
be the case. To prevent so great an evil shall be my 
study and endeavour ; and 1 cannot but ihitter myself, 
that the States, rather than relax in their exertions, will 
be stimulated to the most vigorous preparations for 
another active, glorious, and decisive campaign, which, 
if properly prosecutid will, I trust, under the smiles of 
Heaven, lead us to the end of this long and tedious 
war, and set us down in the full security of the great 
object of our toils, the establislnnent of peace, liberty, 
and independence. 

Whatever may be the policy of European courts 
during this winter, their negotiation will prove too pre- 
carious a dependence for us to trust to. Our wisdom 
should dictate a serious preparation for war, ami in that 
state we shall find ourselves in a situation secure 
against every event. 

Your Excellency's wish for some ships of our allies 
to be stationed at New London, I should have been 
happy to promote, if circumstances would have per- 
mitted ; but Admiral de Grasse has taken almost all 
his ships of war w ith him ; and, except a frigate or 
two left in York River for the security and aid of the 
French troops, who will have their w inter-quarters in 
the vicinity of Yorktown, not a ship of force is left 
upon the American station. The suiiply of fresh beef 
to the Island of Martinico is certainly a desirable ob- 
ject to our allies, and is worthy of attention, but no 
security can be given to its transportation from the 
quarter you mention. I am, &lc.

great sincerity, for the very polite manner in which 
you ai-e pleased to tender me the advantages of your

fer me to begin the freedom of our correspondence by 
observing to your Excellency, that upon our future 
vigorous improvement of the present favorable mo- 
ment depend the happy consequences, which we now

* It was determined in February, of the present year, that a depart- 
ment of war should be instituted, with a secretary at its head. The dif- 
ficulty of a choice seems to have caused a delay in the appointment of 
that officer. Even as late as the 2d of October an election could not be 
made. In a letter of that date from General Varnura, then a member of 
Congress, he writes ; " We have attempted to elect a secretary at war.

my expressions in his favor were not warm aiul lull, 
they fell as far short of my intention as of his merit,

to recommend the latter without the former, wiiom I 
thought equally at least entitled upon every principle 
to promotion. If any thing further can be done by 
me, it must, I conceive, be obtained by some other 
means than a direct application to Congress. In the 
mean time I hope General Knox will take no hasty 
resolution, or at least suspend the execution of it, if 
he should. I am most sincerely yours, &,c. 



TO SIR HEXRY CLIXTOX. 

Ptiiladelptiia, 6 December, 1781. 

Sir, 

I am induced to mention a subject, which has already 
occasioned many discussions. The situation of those 
men ought to be attended to, who, by the chance of 
war, are subjected to the authority of your sovereign 
or mine. It is much to be wished, that all difficulties 
in exchange may be obviated, the expenses of main- 
taining prisoners liquidated, and solid arrangements 
made to provide for them in future. 

From a sincere desire to accomplish these objects, 
I will, upon receiving your Excellency's approbation of 
the plan, appoint Brigadier- General Knox and Gouver- 

are for one or other of tliose gentlemen. We effected nothing. It is 
said, that General Greene cannot be taken from the army, considering 
the situation at the south." General Lincoln was chosen on the 30th of 
October, though he did not enter upon the duties till a month afterwards.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 15 December, 1781. 

My dear Sir, 

I thank you for your kind congratulations on an 
event, which is certainly most important, considered in 
a public view, and which adds to my personal satisfac- 
tion, by finding that it in some degree relieves you 
from that load of difhculty and distress, with which 
you had so long been contending. The evacuation of 
the State of North Carolina is another very fortunate 
circumstance.* 

I presented your recommendation of Colonel Wil- 
liams to Congress, backed by my own, urging the ex- 
pediency of "filling up the vacant brigadierships ; and, 
if thought proper at this time, there is no doubt of 
Colonel Williams being promoted.f 

I hope General St. Clair has before this time joined 
you. The enemy have sent no reinforcement from 
New York to Charleston, nor do I learn that any pre- 
parations are making for such a measure. If it should 
be the opinion, that the British force in South Carolina 
is adequate to the maintenance of Charleston, I should 
not be surprised, if Sir Henry Clinton were to content 
himself with acting upon the defensive in that quarter, 

* The British had recently retired from Wilmington.

at least until the pleasure of the ministry can be 
known ; because an adilitional force, sullicient to re- 
gain and make establishments in the country, is more 
than can ucll be spared from New York. I am in- 
formed, that the English prints of a late date speak 
of a reinforcement pre[)aring from that city for Carolina 
and Florida ; and I think it not improbable, for I fancy 
Lord Cornwallis's private despatches, after the battle of 
Guilford, painted his affairs in no very favorable light. 

I am apprehensive that the States, elated by the late 
success, and taking it for granted that Great Britain 
will no longer support so losing a contest, will relax 
in their preparations for the next campaign. I am de- 
tained here by Congress to assist in the arrangements 
for the next year; and I siiall not fail, in conjunction 
with the financier, the minister of foreign allairs, and 
the secretary at war, who are all most heartily well 
disposed, to impress upon Congress, and get them to 
impress upon the respective States, the necessity of the 
most vigorous exertions. 

I really know not what to say on the subject of re- 
taliation. Congress have it under consideration, and 
we must await their determination. Of this I am con- 
vinced, that of all laws it is the most dilTicult to execute, 
where you have not the transgressor himself in your 
possession. Humanity will ever interfere and plead 
strongly against the sacrifice of an iimocent person for 
the guilt of another ; and, as to destruction of property 
within the enemy's lines, it is in fact destroying our 
own. It will be to the eternal disgrace of the nation, 
which drives us to the disagreeable necessity of thinking 
of means to curb their barbarity.* I am with the 
warmest sentiments of esteem, &.c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

PhUadelphia, 27 December, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with the resolves of the 20th 
instant, directing me to make inquiry into the power 
and conduct of the Board of Directors of the Associated 
Loyalists in New York.* I shall pursue such steps as 
will be most likely to promote the ends which Congress 
have in view. 

I have taken the liberty of enclosing the copies of 
two letters from the commissary-general of prisoners, 
setting forth the debt, which is due from us on account 
of naval prisoners, the number remaining in captivity, 
their miserable situation, and the Uttle probability there 
is of procuring their release for the want of proper 
subjects in our hands. 

Before we proceed to an inquiry into the measures, 
which ought to be adopted to enable us to pay our debt, 
and to effect the exchange of those, who still remain 
in captivity, a matter which it may take some time to 
determine, humanity and policy point out the necessity 

Colonel Hayne. As retaliation necessarily involves the whole Continent, 
I wish your Excellency's order and the order of Congress thereon. The 
latter have signified tlieir approbation of the measures I took. But, as 
retaliation did not take place immediately, nor did I think myself at liberty 
to act on a matter of such magnitude but from the most pressing necessity, 
and as the enemy did not repeat the offence, I have been at a loss how to 
act with respect to the original one, not having any officer of equal rank 
with Colonel Hayne in my possession. I am ready to execute whatever 
may be tliought advisable. It would be happy for America, if something 
could be done to put a stop to the practice of burning, both in the 
northern States and here also ; and, to prevent it here, I wrote to the 
enemy a letter on the subject, a copy of which I enclose ; and if tliey 
do not desist, I will put tlie war on the footing I mention." — MS. Ldter, 
JVovcmber 21st.

gees, or Loyalists. William Franklin, formerly governor of New Jersey,

of administorinnj to the pressing wants of a number of 
the most valuable subjeets of the repuljlic. Had they 
been taken in the Continental service, I should have 
thought myself authorized, in conjunction with the min- 
ister of war, to apply a remedy ; but as the greater 
part of them were not thus taken, as appears by Mr. 
Skinner's representation, I must await the decision of 
Congress upon the subject. Had a system, some time 
ago planned by Congress and recommended to the 
several States, been adopted and carried fully into exe- 
cution, I mean that of obliging all captains of private 
vessels to deliver over their prisoners to the Continental 
commissioners upon certain conditions, I am persuaded 
that the numbers taken and brought into the many ports 
of the United States would have amounted to a sufli- 
ciency to have exchanged those taken from us ; but, 
instead of that, it is to be feared, that few in proportion 
are secured, and that the few, who are sent in, are so 
pai'tially applied, that it creates great disgust in those 
remaining. The consequence of which is, that, con- 
ceiving themselves neglected and seeing no prospect of 
relief, many of them enter into the enemy's service, 
to the very great loss of our trading interest. Congress 
will, therefore, I hope, see the necessity of renewing 
their former or making some similar recommendation to 
the States. 

In addition to the motives above mentioned, for wish- 
ing that the whole business of prisoners of war might 
be brought under one general regulation, there is another 
of no small consideration, which is, that it would proba- 
bly put a stop to those mutual complaints of ill treat- 
ment, which are frequently urged on each part. For 
it is a fact, that, for above two years, we have had 
no reason to complain of the treatment of the Conti- 
nental land prisoners in New York, neither have we 
been charged with any improper conduct towards those 



220 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

in our hands. I consider the sufferings of the seamen 
for some time past, as arising in a great measure from 
the want of that general regulation, which has been 
spoken of, and without which there will constantly be 
a great number remaining in the hands of the enemy. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Part II.] Til i: A M K R I C A N R K V O L U T 1 O N . 221 

I have not liLTctolbre, and wliy I cannot now, address 
you in your public character, or answer you in mine ; 
but the confidence, which you have been pleased to 
repose in me, gives nie an opportunity of ollering you 
my sentiments, as an individual wishing must ardently 
to see the peace and union of his country preserved, 
and the just rights of the people of every part of it 
fully and firmly estabhshed. 

It is not my business, neither do I think it necessary 
now, to discuss the origin of the right of a number 
of inhabitants to that tract of country, formerly dis- 
tinguished by the name of the New Hampshire Grants, 
and now known by that of Vermont. I will take it for 
grantetl, that their right was good, because Congress 
by their resolve of the 7th of August imply it, and by 
that of the 21st are willing fully to confirm it, provided 
the new State is confined to certain described bounds. 
It appears therefore to me, that the dispute of boundary 
is the only one which exists, and that, this being re- 
moved, all further dilliculties would be removed also, 
and the matter terminated to the satisfaction of all par- 
ties. Now, I would ask you candidly whether the 
claim of the people of Vermont was not for a long time 
confined solely, or very nearly, to that tract of country 
which is described in the resolve of Congress of the 
21st of August last, and whether, agreeably to the tenor 
of your own letter to me, the late extension of your 
claim upon New Hampshire and New York was not 
more of a political manoeuvre, than one in which you 
conceived yourselves justifiable. If my first question 
be answered in the afhrmative, it certainly bars your 
new claim ; and, if my second be well founded, your end 
is answered and you have nothing to do but withdraw 

of that territory, in February, 1778, and he acted as such during the 
revolution.

222 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

your jurisdiction to your old limits, and obtain an ac- 
knowledgment of independence and sovereignty, under 
the resolve of the 21st of August, for so much terri- 
tory as does not interfere with the ancient established 
bounds of New York, New Hampshire, and Massa- 
chusetts. I persuade myself you will see and acqui- 
esce in the reason, the justice, and indeed the necessity 
of such a decision. 

You must consider. Sir, that the point now in dispute 
is of the utmost political importance to the future union 
and peace of this great country. The State of Ver- 
mont, if acknowledged, will be the first new one ad- 
mitted into the confederacy, and, if suffered to encroach 
upon the ancient established boundaries of the adjacent 
ones, will serve as a precedent for others, which it may 
hereafter be expedient to set off, to make the same 
unjustifiable demands. Thus, in my private opinion, 
while it behoves the delegates of the States now con- 
federated to do ample justice to a body of people 
sutliciently respectable by their numbers, and entitled 
by other claims to be admitted into that confederation, 
it becomes them also to attend to the interests of their 
constituents, and see, that, under the appearance of 
justice to one, they do not materially injure the rights 
of others. I am apt to think this is the prevailing opinion 
of Congress, and that your late extension of claim has, 
upon the principles I have above mentioned, rather 
diminished than increased the number of your friends, 
and that, if such extension should be persisted in, it will 
be made a common cause, and not considered as only 
affecting the rights of the States immediately inter- 
ested in the loss of territory, a loss of too serious a 
nature not to claim the attention of any people. 

There is no calamity within the compass of my fore- 
sight, which is more to be dreaded, than a necessity of 



PartII.] THK AMERICAN IM: VOLU T I O N. 223 

coercion on the part of Congress ; and consequently 
every endeavour should be used to prevent the execu- 
tion of so disagreeable a measure. It must involve the 
ruin of that State against which the resentment of the 
others is pointed. 

I will only atkl a few words upon the subject of tlie 
negotiations, which liave been cari-ied on between you 
and the enemy in Canada and in New York. I will 
take it for granted, as you assert it, that they were so 
far innocent, that there never was any serious intention 
of joining (ireat Britain in their attempts to subjugate 
your country ; but it has had this certain bad tendency ; 
it has served to give some ground to that delusive opin- 
ion of the enemy, upon which they in a great measure 
lound their hopes of success, that they have numerous 
friends among us, who only want a proper opportunity 
to show themselves openly, and that internal disputes 
and feuds will soon break us in pieces ; at the same time 
the seeds of distrust and jealousy are scattered among 
ourselves by a conduct of this kind. If you are sincere 
in your professions, these will be additional motives for 
accepting the terms, which have been offered, and 
which appear to me equitable, and thereby convincing 
the common enemy, that all their expectations of dis- 
union are vain, and that they have been worsted in 
the use of their own weapon, — deception. 

As you unbosomed yourself to mo, I thought I had 
the greater right of .speaking my sentiments openly and 
candidly to you. I have done so ; and if they should 
produce the etFects, which I most sincerely wish, that 
of an honorable and amicable adjustment of a matter, 
which, if carried to hostile lengths, may destroy the 
future happiness of my country, I shall have attained 
my end, while the enemy will be defeated in theirs.

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE, AT PARIS. 

Philadelpliia, 4 January, 1789. 

My dear Marquis, 

I cannot suifer Colonel Gimat to leave this city tor 
France without a remembrance from me to you. I 
have remained at this place ever since you left it, and 
am happy in having discovered the best disposition im- 
aginable in Congress to prepare vigorously for another 
campaign. They have resolved to keep up the same 
number of corps that constituted the army of last year, 
and have urged the States warmly to complete them. 
Requisitions of money are also made ; but how far the 
ability and inclinations of the individual States to tax 
heavily Avill coincide with the views of Congress, is 
more than I am able, at this early period, to inform 
you. A further pecuniary aid from your generous na- 
tion, and a decisive naval force upon this coast, in the 
latter end of May or beginning of June, unlimited in 
its stay and operations, would, unless the resources of 
Great Britain are inexhaustible, or she can form power- 
ful alliances, bid fair to finish the war in the course of 
the next campaign. 

Aid in money would enable our financier to support 
the expenses of the war with ease and credit, without 
anticipating or deranging those funds, which Congress 
are endeavouring to establish, and which will be pro- 
ductive, though they may be slow in the establishment. 
A naval superiority would compel the enemy to draw 
their whole force to a point, which would not only dis- 
grace their arms by the relinquishment of posts and the 
States which they aflect to have conquered, but might 
eventually be fatal to their army ; or, by attempting 
to hold these posts, they might be cut off" in detail ; so 
that, in either case, the most important good consequen- 
ces would result from the measure.

General Lincoln has accepted his appointiiiuui ol 
secretary of war. Proper plans ol' economy are ailopt- 
ini; in every depai-tnient, aiid I do not despair ol' seeing 
ere long our all'airs under nuich better management 
than they have been ; which will open a new fieid pro- 
ductive, it is to be hoped, of a fruitful harvest. As you 
will have received, in a more direct channel than I'rom 
hence, the news of the surprise and recapture of St. 
Eustatia l)y the arms of France, I shall only congratu- 
late you on that event, and add, that it marks in a 
striking point of view the genius of the Marquis de 
Boullie for enteiprise, and for intrepidity and resources 
in didicult circumstances. His conduct upon this occa 
sion does him inhnite honor. 

I shall be impatient to hear of your safe arrival in 
France, and to receive such communications as you 
know will be interesting to the cause we espouse, and 
in which we are actors. Though unknown to Madame 
de Lafayette, I beg you to present me to her as one of 
her greatest admirers. Be so good also as to make a 
tender of my best wishes to the Duke de Lauzun, and 
other gentlemen of the army of Count de Rochambeau, 
who may be in the circle of your friends, and with 
whom I have the honor of an acquaintance. With 
sentiments of purest affection and most perfect regard, 
I am, my dear Marquis, your assured friend, &,c. 

P. S. — Januanj Hlh. Since writing the foregoing, I 
have had the letter and resolves, herewith sent, put into 
my hands by the delegates from Virginia in Congress. 
I have a peculiar pleasure in becoming the channel, 
through which the just and grateful plaudits of my 
native State are communicated to the man I love. By 
advices just received from South Carolina, the enemy 
have evacuated all their posts in that State, and have

concentred their whole force in Charleston. Wilming- 
ton is also evacuated, and North Carolina is freed from 
its enemies. The disaffected part of the State are suing 
for mercy, and executing, it is said, some of their own 
leaders for having misguided them.

Circular to the States. 

Philadelphia, 22 January, 1782.

Although it may be somewhat out of my province to 
address your Excellency on a subject not immediately 
of a military nature, yet I consider it so nearly con- 
nected with, and so essential to, the operations under 

* The following letter from M. de S6gur, minister of war, was written 
to Lafayette in behalf of the King, after receiving the news of the ca- 
pitulation at Yorktown. 

" Sir, 
" The King being informed of the military talents, which you have re- 
peatedly displayed in commanding the different corps of the army en- 
trusted to you in America, and of the wisdom and prudence, by whicli you 
have been guided in the various parts you have acted in relation to the 
interests of the United States, and of the confidence placed in you by 
General Washington ; his Majesty has charged me to inform you, that 
the praises so justly merited have attracted liis attention, and that your 
conduct and success have caused him to form an opinion of you the most 
favorable that you can desire, and which may authorize you to depend 
on his goodness. To give you a most flattering and decided proof of it, 
his Majesty assures to you the rank of field-marshal [martchal de camp], 
when you sliall have quitted tlie service of tlie United States, and re- 
turned to that of his Majesty. By this decision you will, therefore, be 
considered a field-marshal, dating from the capitulation at Yorktown by 
General Cornwallis, on the 19th of October of the present year, in con- 
sideration of your having then fidfiUed the duties of that rank in the army 
of the United States of America." — MS. Letter from Segur to Lafayette,

my ilirection, that I Hatter mysell' my interference will 
not be deemed impertinent. 

Upon applying to the superintendent of finance to 
know how f;ir I might depend upon him for the pay, 
feeding, and clothing of the army for the current year, 
and for the sums necessary to put it and keep it in mo- 
tion, he very candidly laid open to me tiie state of our 
moneyed aflairs, and convinced me, that although the as- 
sistance we had derived from abroad was considerable, 
yet it would be by no means adequate to our expen- 
ses. He informed me further, that, to make up the de- 
ficiency, the States had been called upon by Congress 
for eight millions of dollars for the service of the year 
1782, and showed me the copy of a circular letter from 
himself to the several legislatures, in which he had 
so fully and clearly pointed out the necessity of a com- 
pliance with the requisition, that it is needless for me 
to say more on that head, than that I entirely concur 
with him in opinion, so fai- as he has gone into the mat- 
ter.* But there are other reasons, which could not be 
so well known to him as they are to me, as having 
come under my immediate observation, and which, 
therefore, I shall take the liberty to mention. 

Your Excellency cannot but remember the ferment, 
into which the whole army was thrown twelve months 
ago for the want of pay and a regular supply of cloth- 
ing and provisions ; and with how^ much difficulty they 
were brought into temper, by a partial supply of the 
two first, and a promise of more regular supplies of 
all in future. Those promises the soldiery now begin 
to claim ; and, although we shall be able to satisfy them 
tolerably in respect to clothing, and perfectly in regard 
to provisions, if the financier is enabled to comply with 

• See this letter in tlic Diplomatic Correspondence, Vol. XI. p. 494. 



228 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

his contracts, yet there is no prospect of obtaining pay, 
until a part of the money required of the States can 
be brought into the public treasury. You cannot con- 
ceive the uneasiness, which arises from the total want of 
so essential an article as money, and the real diiiiculties 
in which the officers in particular are involved on that 
account. The favorable aspect of our afiairs, and the 
hopes that matters are in a train to aflbrd them relief, 
contribute to keep them quiet ; but I cannot answer for 
the effects of a disappointment. 

Enabling the financier to comply with his contracts is 
a matter of the utmost consequence ; the veiy exist- 
ence of the army depends upon it. Should he fail in 
his payments, the contract ceases, and there is no alter- 
native left, but to disband or live upon the seizure of 
the neighbouring property. The saving to the public, 
by feeding an army by contract, is too well known to 
need any illustration, and that alone ought to be a suffi- 
cient inducement to the States to find the means of ad- 
hering to it. 

It will perhaps be urged, that the sum called for is 
immense, and beyond the ability of the country to pay. 
There is one plain answer to that objection, should it 
be made. It is, that, if the war is carried on, a certain 
expense must be incurred, and that such expense must 
be drawn from the people, either by a partial, cruel, and 
I may say illegal seizure of the property, which lies 
most convenient to the army, or by a regular and equita- 
ble tax in money or specific articles. Money, if it can 
be procured, is to be preferred, because it is neither 
liable to waste, nor is it expensive in the mode of col- 
lection or transportation. Whereas I think I may ven- 
ture to say, that a great proportion of the specific 
articles has been wasted after the people have furnished 
them, and that the transportation alone of what have 



PiRTlI.] TUli AMERICAN 1110 VOLUTION. 



229 



reached (he army has in numberless instances cost 
more than the vakie of the articles tlienisclves. 

To bring this war to a speedy and happy conclusion 
must be the fervent wish of every lover of his country ; 
and sure I am, that no means are so likely to elicct 
these as vigorous preparations for another cami)aigii. 
^Vhether, then, we consult our true interest, substantial 
economy, or sound policy, we shall find, that relaxation 
and languor are of all things to be avoided. Conduct 
of that kind on our part will produce fresh hopes and 
new exertions on that of the enemy ; whereby the war, 
which has already held out beyond the general ex- 
pectation, may be protracted to such a length, that the 
people, groaning under the burthen of it, and despairing 
of success, may think any change a change for the 
better. 

I will close with a request, that your Excellency will 
be good enough to take the first opportunity of laying 
these sentiments before the legislature of your State. 
From the attention, which they have ever been pleased 
to pay to any former requisitions or representations of 
mine, I am encouraged to hope, that the present, which 
is equally important with any I have ever made, will 
meet with a favorable reception. 

I have the honor to be, &.c.*

TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 

Philadelphia, 25 January, 1782. 

Sir, 
By a letter, which General Lincoln addressed to me 
before he went to the eastward, I find that you approve 
of my plan of sending officers to tlie four New England 
States particularly, with the returns of their deficien- 
cies of troops, and with instructions to attend upon the 
legislatures, and endeavour to impress them with the 

profit by it. The more they multiply their exertions, the more certain 
will be their success in procuring tlie tranquillity of their country. But, 
if tiiey return to their accustomed inactivity, they will give England time 
to repair her losses, as she seems determined to do, and to prolong the 
war, which it is for the interest of tiie United States to terminate as soon 
as possible. It is greatly to be desired, that, during the approaching year, 
America may be entirely freed from the enemy. An attempt must be 
made to take New York and Charleston. The Americans ought to be 
inspired with the greatest ardor in anticipating these two events. The 
King will certainly concur, as far as circumstances will permit ; and, to 
facilitate as much as possible the preparations of Congress, his Majesty 
is resolved in the course of the year to make them another loan of six 
millions of livres, by instalments of five hundred thousand a month. Let 
Mr. Morris, the minister of finance, be informed of this, and make his 
arrangements accordingly ; but, let him be told in the most peremptory 
manner, that nothing more can be given, and that no drafts on the Ameri- 
can agents in Europe must be made, except what are provided for out 
of this fund. 

" It is impossible to conceive upon what grounds the Americans hope, 
that England is prepared to negotiate with them an advantageous peace. 
To convince them of the contrary, I send you a copy of all the papers, 
which have passed relative to the mediation. You will see by the last 
answer of the court of London to the mediating powers, that England 
still regards the Americans as rebel subjects, and will not begin a nego- 
tiation with France and Spain, till they will consent that she shall treat 
the colonies as she thinks proper ; that is, till we will consent to abandon 
them. The King has not replied to the letter sent to him by the mediat- 
ing powers in consequence of this answer from the court of London. 
You may, in the mean time, assure Congress, that the King will persist 
invariably in the principles of tlie alliance, and will never lend himself to 
a negotiation, which shall have for its object a direct or indirect violation 
of them." — MS. Letter, Versailles, December 2ith, 1781.

expediency, aiul indeed necessity, of filling llieir battal- 
ions previously to the opening of the caiiipiiign. 

He informed me, also, that you would be glad to give 
the same officers some instructions relative to the busi- 
ness of your dL'i):irtnH'nt. If so, I could wish you 
woulil have your letters ready to go by the next post, 
by which time I expect to have the returns prepared. 
I have not yet fixed upon the gentlemen, but you can 
leave blanks for the inserUon of the names of those, 
who may be chosen. 

As w-e may reasonably expect to hear soon again 
from Sir Henry Clinton, on the subject of the meeting 
of commissioners, I think it would be well to be pre- 
paring the substance of the powers to be delegated 
to the gentlemen, to whom the transaction of the pro- 
posed business will be committed. What I would wish 
you to prepare particularly, is so much as will relate to 
the liquidation of the accounts of prisoners, and to 
making provision for their maintenance in future.

TO PHILIP SCHUYLEK. 

Philadelphia, 29 January, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 
I have no doubt, from the various and essential ser- 
vices you have rendered to your country, that you must 
be extremely obnoxious to the enemy. To protect 
your person against any insidious attempts from them, 
a guard was therefore ordered from the New York line ; 
but, as it is important that the troops should be col- 
lected, and the corps be kept together as much as 
possible this winter, I should wish all the men, who 
are able, might join their regiments at Pompton. And, 



232 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Ex. 49. 

in the mean time, I liave enclosed an order to the 
commanding oflicer of the New Hampshire line to fur- 
nish a guard to replace the former, while those regi- 
ments continue at the northward. I hope in the spring 
there may be such a provision made of State troops, 
or levies, that this guard may also be relieved or taken 
off without hazard or inconvenience. 

Every information tending to prove, that the affairs 
respecting the Grants may be speedily and happily ac- 
commodated, gives me singular satisfaction. 1 will flat- 
ter myself, that both the articles of intelligence you 
have received are well grounded,* and that it will be 
the unremitting effort of every one, who is well affected 
to the general cause, to prevent the horrors of civil 
discord in any part of the United States. It has been 
intimated, that some of the enemy's shipping and armed 
vessels have been detained by the ice in Lake Cham- 
plain in such a manner, that they might be destroyed 
and the cannon brought off. If the fact is so, I will 
thank you for as early and explicit information as pos- 
sible, that measures may be taken accordingly. The 
destruction of those vessels, would, I think, greatly 
impede any future incursions from that quarter. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

from your State, in order that measures may be taken 
for completing the re,i;;iinents to tiie full estahlisliment, 
agreeably to the resolution of Congress on the 10th of 
December. I rannt)t omit so favorable an occasion 
of expressing to your Excellency my sentiments on 
that subject, and of entreating, in the most earnest 
manner, that there may be a speedy, pointed, and 
effectual compliance with those requisitions. 

It will, I flatter myself, be unnecessary to recapitulate 
all the arguments I made use of in the circular letter 
I had the honor to address to the governors of the 
several States, at the close of the campaign of 1780; 
in which, it must be remembered, I took the liberty to 
urge, from the knowledge I had of our alfairs and a 
series of experience, the policy, the expediency, the 
necessity of recruiting the army, as the only probable 
means of biinging the war to a speedy and happy 
conclusion. If those arguments had any influence at 
that time, if the consequent exertions were crowned 
with any success, if the present crisis exhibits new 
and more forcible inducements for still greater eflbrts, 
let me point your Excellency and the legislature to 
those considerations ; and especially let me recommend, 
in the warmest terms, that all the fruits of the suc- 
cesses, which have been obtained the last campaign, 
may not be thrown away by an inglorious winter of 
languor and inactivity. 

However, at this advanced stage of the war, it might 
seem to be an insult to the understanding to suppose 
a long train of reasoning necessary to prove, that a re- 
spectable force in the field is essential to the estab- 
lishment of our liberties and independence ; yet, as I 
am apprehensive the prosperous issue of the combined 
operation in Virginia may have (as is too common in 
such cases) the pernicious tendency of lulling the coun- 

VOL. VIII. 30 T* 



234 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt.49. 

try into a lethargy of inactivity and security ; and as I 
feel my own reputation, as well as the interest, the 
honor, the glory, and happiness of my country, inti- 
mately connected with the event, I will ask the indul- 
gence to speak more freely on those accounts, and to 
make some of the observations, which the present mo- 
ment seems to suggest. 

The broken and perplexed state of the enemy's af- 
fairs, and the successes of the last campaign on our 
part, ought to be a powerful incitement to vigorous 
preparations for the next. Unless we strenuously ex- 
ert ourselves to profit by these successes, we shall not 
only lose all the solid advantages that might be derived 
from them, but we shall become contemptible in our 
own eyes, in the eyes of our enemy, in the opinion of 
posterity, and even in the estimation of the whole 
world, which will consider us as a nation unworthy of 
prosperity, because we know not how to make a right 
use of it. 

Although we cannot, by the best concerted plans, 
absolutely command success, although the race is not 
always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, yet, 
without presumptuously waiting for miracles to be 
wrought in our favor, it is our indispensable duty, with 
the deepest gratitude to Heaven for the past, and hum- 
ble confidence in its smiles on our future operations, 
to make use of all the means in our power for our de- 
fence and security. This period is particularly impor- 
tant, because no circumstances since the commence- 
ment of the war have been so favorable to the recruit- 
ing service as the present, and because it is to be 
presumed, from the increase of population and the 
brilliant prospects before us, that it is actually in our 
power to complete the army before the opening of the 
campaign. However flattering these prospects may be, 



I'artII.I Tin: AMKRlCAiN UEVOLUTIOiN. 235 

iiukIi slill rc'inains to be clone, which cannot probably 
l)e etlcctCLl unless the army is recruited to its cstab- 
lislmient; and consequently the continuance or termi- 
nation ol' the war seems principally to rest on the Aigor 
and decision of the States in this interesting point. 
And, finally, it is our first object of policy, under every 
supposuble or possible case, to have a pouerl'ul army 
early in tiir field; for we must suppose the enemy are 
either disposed to j)rosecute the war, or to enter into a 
negotiation for peace. There is no other alternative. 
On the former supposition, a respectable army becomes 
necessary to counteract the enemy, and to prevent 
the accumulating expenses of a lingering war ; on the 
latter, nothing hut a decidedly superior force can enable 
us boldly to claim our rights and dictate the law at the 
pacification. So that, whatever the disposition of the 
enemy may be, it is evidently our only interest and 
economy to act liberally, and exert ourselves gready 
during the present winter to cut ofi" at once all the 
expenses of the war by putting a period to it. 

And soon might that day arrive, and we might hope 
to enjoy all the blessings of peace, if we could see 
again the same animation in the cause of our country 
inspiring every breast, the same passion for freedom 
and military glory impeUing our youths to the field, and 
the same disinterested patriotism pervading every rank 
of men, that was conspicuous at the commencement 
of this glorious revolution ; and I am persuaded, that 
only some great occasion was wanting, such as the 
present moment exhibits, to rekindle the latent sparks 
of that patriotic fire into a generous fianie, to rouse 
again the unconquerable spirit of liberty, which has 
sometimes seemed to slumber for awhile, into the full 
vigor of action. 

I cannot now conclude this letter without expressing 



236 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

my full expectation, that the several States, animated 
with the noblest principles and convinced of the policy 
of complying faithfully with the requisitions, ^\■ill be only 
emulous which shall be foremost in furnishing its quota 
of men; that the calculations of the numbers wanted 
to fill the deficiencies may be so ample as, allowing for 
all the casualties and deductions, will be sufficient cer- 
tainly to complete the battalions ; that the measures for 
this purpose may be so explicit, pointed, and energetic, 
as will inevitably furnish the recruits in season; and 
that such checks may be established to prevent impo- 
sition, as to the quality of the men, that no recruits 
may be accepted but those, who ai-e in fact able-bodied 
and effective. Should any of a different description be 
sent to the army, they must be rejected, the expense 
thrown away, and the service injured, though others 
are requii'ed to fill their places ; for it is only deceiving 
ourselves with having a nominal instead of a real force, 
and consuming the public provisions and clothing to 
no eflect, to attempt to impose decrepit and improper 
men or boys upon us as soldiers. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Philadelphia, 9 February, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your Excellency's favor of 
the 12th and 22d ultimo, the latter enclosing copies 
of General Greene's letter to you and your answer. 
After mforming you that I concur with you in opinion, 
that it would not be politic at this moment to move a 
detachment from your main body to the southward, 
permit me to assure you, that I very sensibly feel your 



I'AUT 11.1 TllK AMKRICAN REVOLUTION. 237 

goodness in cleterminins to advance the legion as soon 
as possible lo the huiitiers of North Carolina. I have 
only to request, that the commanding ollicer may have 
orders to proceed further or not as circumstances may 
reijuire. The move of the legion will be perplexing to 
the enemy ; and, as it has been heretofore tiie advance 
corps of your army, you may, I think, give out, and it 
will ciu-ry w ith it strong marks of probability, that your 
whole army is to follow, as soon as the weather will 
admit of the march. Supposing the enemy sliould re- 
ceive the reinforcement from Ireland, I do not imagine 
that they will, after the many severe blows they have 
felt from plunging themselves into the country, march 
to any great distance from Charleston ; especially if they 
consider, that, while France has a naval superiority ia 
the West Indian or American seas, a body of troops 
might be easily thrown in between them and the town, 
whereby their ruin would be inevitable. 

It would certainly be our true interest, if it could be 
done, to give General Greene sucli a force, that he 
should be able, under all circumstances, to keep the 
enemy confined to their posts upon the coasts of South 
Carolina and Georgia ; but, should your excellent and 
valuable body of men be made use of for that pur- 
pose, it might possibly interfere with the plan of the 
campaign, which we may shortly expect from your 
court. Those States, whose troops compose the south- 
em army, will be pressed to send forward reinforce- 
ments to General Greene as early and as expeditiously 
as possible. 

I am apprehensive that your Excellency will think 
me unmindful of a most agreeable piece of duty, which 
I have been directed to perform by Congress. It is 
the presentation of two of the field-pieces taken at 
York, with an inscription engraved on them expressive

of the occasion. I find a difficulty in getting the en- 
graving properly executed. When finished, I shall with 
peculiar pleasure put the cannon into your possession. 

In an address, which I have lately received from the 
Senate of the State of Virginia, on account of the sur- 
render of York and Gloucester, I am desired to make 
their most grateful acknowledgments to your Excel- 
lency and to the officers and men under your com- 
mand, for your eminent services upon that occasion, 
and to assure you, that they see with pleasure the 
harmony, which subsists between the inhabitants of the 
State and their generous allies. I take the first oppor- 
tunity of making this agreeable communication. 

In my letter of the 14th of January, I requested 
that Lord Rawdon might be exchanged for Brigadier- 
General Moultrie of South Carolina, in preference to 
any of the colonels mentioned by Sir Henry Clinton ; 
it being more conformable to our practice than to make 
exchanges by composition. I now take the hberty of 
confirming that request.* I am, &lc.

Colonel Ternaiit, wlio is the bearer of this, will be 
able more fully to enforce the reasons of my senti- 
ments and wishes. You will perceive that oflicer is 
appointed inspector to the southern army. It is an of- 
fice of importance, and requires a gentleman of ability 
and activity to perform the duties of it with propriety. 
I pray you will be persuaded, that I can never be

discovered for the service, and (hat, 1 am, with great

TO Till". PRESIDENT OF CO.VGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 18 February, 1782. 

Sir, 
I do myself the honor to enclose copies of the re- 
ports of the commissary-general of prisoners, who has 
just returned from New York, with copies of the pa- 
pers to which he refers. Your Excellency will per-

ceive thereby, that tlie restriction upon the exchange 
of Lieutenant-General Earl Cornwallis operates against 
the hberation of Brigadier-General Scott, seven colo- 
nels and two lieutenant-colonels, who, upon the prin- 
ciples of the tarifl' established between us and the en- 
emy, are equivalent to his Lordship in value. 

I also enclose the copy of a letter from Sir Henry 
Clinton, by which it would appear that the exchange 
of Mr. Laurens might be effected for Earl Cornwallis, 
should Congress think proper to accede to the propo- 
sal. I beg leave to remark upon that letter, that there 
has been some misconception either on the part of 
Colonel Laurens or Lord Cornwallis, as to what pass- 
ed on the subject in Virginia. Colonel Laurens asked 
me there, whether, supposing an exchange could be 
effected between his father and his Lordship, 1 should 
have any objection to it. I answered, none personally, 
and that, as Congress had made no difficulty in offer- 
ing General Burgoyne for Mr. Laurens, I thought they 
might now probably offer Lord Cornwallis, but that the 
matter did not depend upon me. This I find has 
been construed into absolute consent on my part. 

With i-espect to the policy of prohibiting the ex- 
change of Lord Cornwallis I will not pretend to deter- 
mine. I cannot, however, help observing, that it ope- 
rates disagreeably in giving uneasiness to those officers 
of ours, who can only be exchanged by composition, 
and who are by the enemy set against him, and that it 
may be considered as a departure from the spirit of 
the terms of the capitulation of York. 

Mr. Sproat's proposition of the exchange of British 
soldiers for American seamen, if acceded to, will im- 
mediately give the enemy a very considerable rein- 
forcement, and will be a constant draft hereafter upon 
the prisoners of war in our hands. It ought also to

be considered, that few or none of the naval prisoners 
in New York and elsewhere belong to the Continental 
service. 1 however feel for the situation of these nn- 
fortunate people, and wish to see them relieved by any 
mode, which will not materially allect the public good. 
In some former letters upon this subject 1 have men- 
tioned a plan, by which I am certain they might be 
liberated nearly as fast as captured. It is by obliging 
the captains of all armed vessels, both public ami pri- 
vate, to throw their prisoners into common stock un- 
der the direction of the commissary-general of prison- 
ers. By these means they would be taken caie ol 
and regularly applied to the exchange of those in the 
hands of the enemy. Now the greater part are dis- 
sipated, and the few that remain arc applied partially. 
I shall be obliged to your Excellency for obtaining and 
transmitting to me the sentiments of Congress upon 
these subjects as early as convenient,

TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS.* 

Philadelphia, 18 February, 1782. 

My dear Laurens, 

I have had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 
10th of December, and also the report of the judicious 
and successful movement of General Greene, by w hich 
he compelled the enemy to abandon their out-posts. 
This brilliant manccuvre is another proof of the singu- 
lar abilities which that oflicer possesses. 

Since my last despatches from South Carolina I have 
been informed, by way of Virginia, of the intelligence 



» Colonel Laurens joined the Boutliern army shortly after the capitu- 
lation at Yorktown. 

VOL, Vlll. 31 u 



242 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 49. 

General Greene had received, that a reinforcement was 
expected from Ireland, of the application he had made 
in consequence to the Count de Rochambeau, and of 
the resolution the Count had taken of detaching the 
legion of Lauzun to his aid. I hope this force, to- 
gether with the corps of Armand, will give such a 
decided superiority of cavalry, as will prevent the en- 
emy from reoccupying and ravaging the country again, 
should the whole reinforcement from Ireland arrive. 
And I must confess, that I cannot entirely rely upon 
it, as I have not heard the intelligence from any other 
quarter, although a frigate has just arrived at New 
York with the King of England's speech, and de- 
spatches from administration. Nothing however has 
transpired except the speech, from the complexion of 
which no decisive opinion can be formed. 

But I think a little time will disclose what the en- 
emy's intentions are, should they still persist in the 
prosecution of the war, and whether they mean to oc- 
cupy the two great posts of New York and Charles- 
ton, or concentre the whole of their force together. 
In the former case, reinforcements may undoubtedly 
be expected ; and I know of nothing, which can be 
opposed to them with such a prospect of success, as 
the corps you have proposed should be levied in 
Carolina. To make the campaign decisive is our 
great object. I wish that the States might be im- 
pressed with the necessity of taking their measures 
accordingly, and that the war might not be procrasti- 
nated by want of exertion on our part.* Believe me,

TO Tin: IMIKSIDENT OF CONGRKSS. 

Philadelphia, 20 J^bruary, 1782. 

Sir, 
Since ray letter to your Excellency of the 18tli in- 
stant, I have been honored with the pubhc and secret 
resolves of Congress of the same date ; the former 
empowering me to appoint commissioners for the pur- 
poses therein mentioned, the latter prohibiting the ex- 
change of Lieutenant-General Lord Cornwallis by com- 
position, which is the only mode by which he ever 
can be exchanged, except for civil characters, we hav- 
ing no military grade answerable to his.* 

tliemsclves as lost and unsupported. The reinforcement from New York 
was not more than six or seven hundred men. The King's speech at the 
openintr of the British Parliament is firm, and manifests a determination 
to continue the war, although there is no appearance of his having' made 
any alliances. This I hope will prove to the States the necessity of com- 
plying with the requisitions upon them for men and supplies. Every ar- 
gument that I could invent to induce them to it, has been made use of by 
me in two sets of circular letters. No part of the intelligence brought 
by the frigate haa yet gone abroad. It is no doubt of consequence. If 
any alteration is to be made in the disposition of the force remaining in 
America, it must soon become visible. Until we hear from the court of 
France, we can only be making general preparations. Men arc the most 
material of all ; and 1 cannot say that the means of obtaining them, so 
far as I have yet heard, are efficacious." — Februari/ ^^'lll. 

* By the resolves here referred to. Congress invested General Wash- 
ington with powers to negotiate an exchange of prisoners on tlie broad- 
est scale, and to take measures for settling all accounts respecting pris- 
oners ; but tliese resolves were accompanied with a " secret inslnidion" 
that nothing contained tlierein " should be construed to authorize the ex- 



244 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 49. 

I find myself so exceedingly embarrassed by the 
operation of the secret resolve, that I hope Congress 
will excuse me for pointing out the difficulties in which 
it involves me personally, and the manner in which it 
affects, as I conceive, the public good. By the public 
resolve all former restrictions are taken off, and I am 
at liberty to go into a general exchange without lim- 
itation. When it therefore shall be found, that Lord 
Cornwallis is still detained, those officers of ours (par- 
ticularly our full colonels, most of whom can only be 
exchanged on composition), who will be sufferers on 
that account, will naturally apply to me for the rea- 
sons. I must either submit to their opinions of a con- 
duct so apparendy strange, or, to justify myself, must 
be under the necessity of betraying a secret vote of 
Congress. 

In order more clearly to point out the manner, in 
which the secret resolve, if adhered to, will operate 
against the public interest, I must beg leave to re- 
quest the attention of Congress to a short recital of 
the reasons, which induced me, at this particular time, 
to propose a meeting of commissioners to the British 
Commander-in-chief. 

On my return from Virginia, the superintendent of 
finance informed me, that the subsistence of the pris- 
oners of war had now become so serious a matter, that 
there was an absolute necessity of endeavouring to ob- 



change of Lieutenant-General Cornwallis by composition." It appears 
to have been the object of this reservation to secure the release of Mr. 
Laurens, who was yet retained a prisoner in England, and had been for 
more than a year shut up in the Tower of London. The southern mem- 
bers were particularly strenuous on this point, as well as indignant at 
the mode adopted by Lord Cornwallis in prosecuting the war at the 
south. For a remarkable expression of the feelings of the delegates 
from South Carolina and Georgia on this subject, see Journals, Febru- 
ary 2.3rf.

tain paymont of the money already due to us upon 
tliat account, and at all events to fix uj)()n some cer- 
tain an(l regular mode of payment for llieir mainte- 
nance in future. In order to efTect these objects, he 
advised my makin;^ propositions to Sir Henry Clinton 
lo a|ipoinl commissioners, not only to licjuidate the ac- 
counts of prisoners, but to endeavour, by the estab- 
lishment of a permanent cartel (a matter, which we 
have never yet been able to obtain), to adjust a num- 
ber of points relating to the exchanges and accommo- 
dation of prisoners, for want of which, individuals, as 
well the subjects of the United States as those of 
Great Britain, are daily sufiering. 

Sir Henry Clinton, after several letters had passed 
between us on the subject, acceded to the proposition 
in the most extensive sense. Commissioners were 
named, and I only waited for the authority of Con- 
gress to enable me to invest the commissioners on 
our part with proper powers. This by the public re- 
solve of tlie 18th is amply granted, but by the subse 
quent secret resolve it is in a manner done away. 
The powers of our commissioners can only have refer- 
ence to the public resolve, and whatever stipulations 
are entered into will be upon a confidence, that no 
further obstructions will be thrown in the way. The 
exchange of Lord Cornwallis (as heretofore) would be 
one of the first things demanded ; and, should that be 
rejected, as it must be, the enemy would not only 
have it in their power to tax us with a breach of 
faith, but thev might recede in turn from any part of 
their agreements ; and it is to be feared, that they 
would pitch upon that respecting the payment for the 
maintenance of their prisoners, as it will be a weighty 
matter to them, and one which they can evade with 
less inconvenience than almost any other, as we have 



246 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [vEt. 49. 



a very great number of theirs to support, and they 
few of ours. 

In addition to what I have said, I have only further 
to remark, that the gentlemen, who have been named 
by me to execute the commission, have objections to 
going upon it, unless they can meet those from the 
British on fair and open terms. This can only be done 
either by withdrawing the secret vote entirely, or by 
adhering publicly to the resolution of detaining Lord 
Cornwallis, and trying what can be effected under such 
circumstances. The last would remove my present 
scruples, if it should not be deemed a violation of the 
capitulation ; but I fear, as I before mentioned, that the 
general interest would suffer by the measure. We 
never can expect that such a cartel, as will be really 
beneficial to us, will be acceded to while an officer of 
Lord Cornwallis's high rank and family influence is 
excepted, nor indeed while a power is reserved or 
implied of being able to deprive of the right of ex- 
change any other officer, who may hereafter as a pris- 
oner of war become entided to the advantages of a 
stipulation of such a nature as a cartel.* 

I ever with diffidence enter into discussions of the 
above kind, and I am now more than commonly appre- 
hensive, that my conduct may appear reprehensible, as 
Congress have been pleased, upon several late appli- 
cations, to adhere to their former opinions respecting 
Lord Cornwallis. Had I not seen new difficulties 
arising from restricting his exchange, I should have 



* On a consideration of tliis letter, it was resolved by Congress, " That

Cornwallis by composition ; provided that the Honorable Henry Laurena 
be liberated, and proper assurances be obtained, that all accounts for 
the support of the convention prisoners, and all other prisoners of war, 
shall be speedily settled and discharged." — Journals, February 23J.

TO SIR HENRY CLINTON. 

Philadelphia, 26 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have appointed the meeting of our respective com- 
missioners to be at Elizabethtown on the 15th of next 
month. If I hear nothing further from your Excellen- 
cy, I shall take it for granted, that you accede to the 
time and place. And I would propose, as is usual in 
such cases, tliat a cessation of hostilities should take 
place, during the meeting, from Amboy to Newark, 
both included. 

As my commissioners will go fully authorized to 
treat of the exchanges of Lord Cornwallis and the 
Honorable Mr. Laurens, I have no occasion to be par- 
ticular in my answer to your Excellency's letter on 
that subject. I shall only observe, that I apprehend 
Lord Cornwallis misunderstood Colonel Laurens, in 
the conversation they had upon that matter in Vir- 
ginia. I could never have given an assurance, that 
his Lordship should be exchanged for Mr. Laurens, 
the father of the colonel, as I had no authority to 
make any such stipulation. 

I have the honor to be, &,c. 



248 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL WILLIAM IRVINE. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

You will proceed with all convenient despatch to 
Fort Pitt, the object of your command, and you will 
take such measures for the security of that post and 
for the defence of the western frontier, as your Conti- 
nental force combined with the militia of the neighbour- 
ing country will admit. Under present appearances 
and circumstances, I can promise no further addition 
to your regular force, than a proportion of reci-uits for 
the Virginia and Pennsylvania regiments, which are al- 
ready upon the western station ; consequently offensive 
operations, except upon a small scale, cannot just now 
be brought into contemplation. You may, however, 
still continue to keep yourself informed of the situa- 
tion of Detroit, and the strength of the enemy at that 
place. 

With respect to the subject of the letters, which you 
have lately received from Colonel Gibson, I can only 
repeat what I have said to you personally. You must 
endeavour to convince both officers and men, that 
measures are actually taking to put them upon such a 
footing with regard to their provisions, clothing, and 
pay, that it is to be hoped they will ere long have no 
reason to complain. They will have already found the 
difference between their past and present mode of ob- 
taining provisions and clothes ; and they cannot there- 
fore doubt, that the only remaining difficulty, which is 
on account of pay, will be removed as soon as the 
financier can reap the advantages of the taxes for the 
current year, which are but just laid, and cannot there- 
fore come yet into use. The officers and men must, 
upon a moment's reflection, be convinced of the wis-

dom dl" applying? the public money in hand to pro- 
ciirinj;- vicliial.s and clotiu'S. Tiu-y cannot be dispensed 
with even for a day; ami whru \»>\\\ are assured that 
certificates of pay, due to the 1st of the present yeai-, 
will be i^ivon with interest, and that pay thenceforward 
will be more regular anil as frequent as the public 
treasury will admit, they ought to be satisfied. 

Should the troops composing the western garrison 
be discontented with their situation, and think that they 
are partially dealt by, you may make them an oiler of 
being relieved and of taking their chance of the emolu- 
ments, which they may suppose accrue to those serving 
with either the noilhern or southern armies. There 
may be policy in this oiler, because, if I am not mis- 
taken, most of the men, who have connexions in the 
upper country, would rather remain there at some dis- 
advantage than be brought away from their families. 

You will make such arrangements, as shall comport 
with the above instructions and the strictest principles 
of economy, with General Knox and the quartermaster- 
general respecting military and other stores necessary 
for the posts under your orders ; and you will, I am 
persuaded, use every means in your power to prevent 
any waste or embezzlement of them. Given at Head- 
Quarters, at Pliiladelphia, the 8th of March, 1782. 



TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND 
GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Instructions. 

Gentlemen, 

The powers of equal date herewith authorize you 
to proceed to Elizabelhtown, in the State of New Jer-

250 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 50. 

sey, in order to meet commissioners on the part of the 
enemy, on Friday the 15th* instant, for the purposes 
in the powers fully recited. 

You will consider the settlement of accounts for the 
subsistence of prisoners of all descriptions from the 
commencement of the war to ; obtain- 

ing payment, or security for the payment, of the large 
balance, which it is presumed was due to the Unit- 
ed States at that period, and establishing some cer- 
tain arrangements for the regular payment of the sub- 
sistence of prisoners from that time forward, as the 
principal objects of your commission. 

From the want of an appointment of a commissary 
of prisoners until some time after the commencement 
of the war, from the variety of hands to which the 
charge of prisoners was committed, and from the little 
attention, which was for a long time paid to the sums 
expended for their support, I fear it will be difficult for 
you to collect the materials necessary to form our ac- 
count with sufficient accuracy to satisfy yourselves, or 
to gain credit with the commissioners on the part of the 
enemy. And it is also probable, that the accounts, 
which will be produced by them, will be alike subject 
to many objections for want of proper vouchers and 
other causes. 

You are therefore at liberty, if you find no proba- 
bility of being able to make a regular settlement, to 
compound the matter, by fixing upon such a sum as 
shall appear to you reasonable, which sum shall, upon 
payment, be looked upon as a full and final discharge 
of all demands on the part of the United States from 
the commencement of the war to the time which you 

* The commissioners did not meet and exchange powers till the 31st

shall specify. Y'ou air, then, in order to prevent ;)11 
luture disputes, to determine, ot" what a ration for the 
support of a prisoner of war sluill niutuaily consist ; 
the value of that ration, not only in whole, hut in its 
component parts ; what vouchers shall he esteemed mu- 
tually valid ; and to obtain and give proper assurances 
lor llie reguhir monthly and (juarterly payments of the 
balances, as they may respectively become due. 

Before you proceed to the negotiation of exchanges, 
you will pay due regard to the resolve of Congress 
of the 23d of February last, with a copy of which 
you are furnished, which authorizes the exchange of 
Lieutenant-General Earl Cornwallis only upon certain 
conditions therein specified. By the word liberulcd, 
in the resolve referred to, it is not to be understood, 
that Mr. Laurens is to be given up without any equiv- 
alent. At what the enemy will rate him is uncertain. 
Congress once oflered a lieutenant-general lor him; and, 
if the same should be demanded now, and insisted up- 
on, you are at liberty to comply. If circumstances 
should render the exchange of Lord Cornwallis im- 
practicable, the respective commissaries of prisoners 
may proceed to the exchange of other officers ; and, 
if the enemy should persist in their resolution of de- 
taining a certain number of our oflicers of rank, as a 
counter security to our detention of Lord Cornwallis, 
it may be submitted to, upon the following principle, 
that it will be better for four or five gentlemen (the 
number who will be involved) to remain in captivitVj 
than the whole, amounting to considerably above one 
hundred. 

In compliance with a resolve of Congress of the 20th 
of December last, a copy of which and some papers 
relating to it you have herewith, you will enter into a 
discussion with the British commissioners upon the 



252 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Ex. 50. 



powers and conduct of the Board of Dii-ectors of the 
Associated Loyalists in New York, and you will en- 
deavour to devise some means for the prevention of 
that kind of depredation, which is complained of. On 
this subject you will do nothing conclusive, but report 
to me the substance of the measure, which may have 
seemed to the British commissioners and yourselves 
most likely to answer the end. 

I recommend to your particular attention the case 
of one Summers, a native of Pennsylvania, taken in 
1778, and yet detained upon Long Island, notwith- 
standing every reasonable offer has been made to pro- 
cure his exchange. The commissary of prisoners can 
inform you fully of his situation and circumstances. 

Should you enter into either a general or special 
cartel, you will endeavour to stipulate, that, in future, 
citizens not in arms shall not be considered as sub- 
jects of capture, but in particular cases, such as for 
guides, for intelligence, and such hke purposes ; and 
that they shall be well treated, and discharged after 
the ends for which they were captured are answered. 

Should the admiral accede to my proposition of 
sending commissioners to meet you, on the subject of 
tlie treatment and exchange of marine prisoners, you 
will endeavour in the first place to obtain a change in 
the mode of keeping our seamen confined. The daily 
complaint of the miseries incident to confinement on 
board prison-ships will authorize you to remonstrate 
warmly on that head, and to insist upon an alteration 
of conduct. In respect to the support and mode of 
payment for the subsistence of seamen, you will be 
guided by the instruction relating to the rations of 
soldiers. 

You are acquainted with the difficulties under which 
we labor, as to the means of procuring the exchange 



1>A K T II.] T I IK A M K II 1 C A N K K V O L U T 1 IS . 253 

of tlie Aiiiericau seamen, \vli() fall into the hands of the 
enemy. It but rarely happens, tliat those captured l)y 
private vessels of war arc given up to the Continental 
commissaries. Some are taken into our service, many 
escape through negligence, and therefore it is that the 
balance of marine prisoners has been generally greatly 
against us. The mode proposed by Admiral Digby 
of giving up land prisoners for seamen is altogether 
inadmissible. It would prove a constant source of re- 
inforcement to the enemy. Under present circum- 
stances I do not see, that you can come to any final 
determination upon the mode of exchanging or liber- 
ating seamen. Should commissaries meet you on that 
subject, you w^ll in conjunction with them form a plan, 
which may be deemed mutually equitable and conven- 
ient, and report upon it. 

You have herewith the copies of the letters, whicli 
have passed between the British general and admiral 
and myself upon the subject of your commission. The 
superintendent of finance will furnish you with mate- 
riEds for stating our claims for subsistence of prisoners, 
so far as he has been able to obtain them ; and the 
commissary of prisoners will furnish you with any of- 
ficial papers, which may be in his possession, and 
which may be found necessary to the accomplishment 
of a general or special cartel. Given under my hand 
and seal, at Philadelphia, the Uth day of March, 1782. 

P. S. Since the above, I have been furnished by 
Congress with a number of representations respecting 
the treatment of our marine prisoners. I have thought 
it proper to put them into your hands, that you may 
make the necessary use of them.

TO JAMES MCHENRY. 

Philadelphia, 12 March, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

The fair hand, to whom your letter of the 20th of 
January was committed, presented it safely, and, as you 
rightly observed, the value of it was enhanced thereby. 
Good laws, ample means, and sufficient powers, may 
render the appointment of your intendant * a public 
benefit ; and, from the spirit of your people, I hope 
these are provided. Without them, the appointment 
must be nugatory. Never, since the commencement 
of the present revolution, has there been in my judg- 
ment a period, when vigorous measures were more con- 
sonant with sound policy than the present. The speech 
of the British King, and the addresses of the Lords 
and Commons, are proofs to my mind of two things ; 
namely, their wishes to prosecute the American war, 
and their fears of the consequences. My opinion of 
the matter is, therefore, that the minister will obtain 
supplies for the current year, prepare vigorously for an- 
other campaign, and then prosecute the war, or treat 
of peace, as circumstances and fortuitous events may 
justify ; and that nothing will contribute more to the 
first, than a relaxation or apparent supineness on the 
p.irt of these States. The debates upon the addresses 
evidently prove, what I have here advanced, to be true ; 
for these addresses, as explained, are meant to answer 
any purpose the ministers may have in view. What 
madness then can be greater, or what policy and econo- 
my worse, than to let the enemy again rise upon our folly 
and want of exertion 1 Shall we not be justly charge-

able for all the blood anil treasure, which shall be 
wasted in a lingering war, procrastinated by ialse ex- 
pectations of peace, or timid measures for the prose- 
cution of it ? Surely we shall ; ami much is it to be 
himented, that our endeavours do not at all times ac- 
cord with our wishes. Each State is anxious to see 
the end of our wariare accomplished, but shrinks when 
it is called upon for the means ; and either withholds 
them altogether, or grants them in such a way as to 
defeat the end. Such, it is to be feared, will be the 
case in many instances respecting the requisitions of 
men and money. 

I ha\e the pleasure, however, to inform you, that the

supply-bill without a dissenting voice, and that a lauda- 
ble spirit seems to pervade all the members of that 
body ; but I fear, notwithstanding, that they will be de- 
ficient in their quota of men. It is idle at this late pe- 
riod of the war, when enthusiasm is cooled, if not done 
awav, when the minds of that class of men, who are 
proper subjects for soldiers, are poisoned by the high 
bounties which have been given, and the knowledge 
of the distresses of the army so generally difiused 
through every State, to suppose that our battalions can 
be completed by voluntary enlistment. The attempt is 
vain, and we are only deceiving ourselves and injuring 
the cause by making the experiment. There is no 
other efTectual method to get men suddenly, but that 
of classing the people, and compelling each class to 
furnish a recruit. Here every man is interested ; every 
man becomes a recruiting ollicer. If our necessity for 
men did not press, I should prefer the mode of vol- 
untary enlistment ; as it does, I am sure it will not

suppose that such a recommendation would have any

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

PhUadelphia, 18 March, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 
It gives me the more pain to hear of your distresses 
for want of clothing and other necessai'ies, as you are 
at so great a distance, that you cannot be suddenly re- 
lieved, even if we had the means. I am not, however, 
without hopes, that, should the war be continued to the 
southward (of which I have my doubts, for reasons 
which I shall presently give), matters will be put into a 
much better train than they have hitherto been. The 
arrangements made already, by the superintendent of 
finance, have been attended with infinite public advanta- 

with an opportunity of justifying tlie marks of esteem and confidence 
with which you may honor me. 

" You honored my cousin-german, Pulaski, with your confidence. If 
you will continue it to me, my zeal and attachment shall requite your 
goodness. I have just quitted the service of the Emperor, whom I serv-

de balailU ; and I entered into the service of Franco only to put my- 
self in a condition to come to America, Such has been my conduct.

ges, and he is extending those arrangements as fast as 
circumstances will possibly admit. I am sorry to see a 
jealousy, arising from a supposition that there has been 
a partiality of conduct. I am certain there has been no 
such intention, and that, instead of a charge of having 
done too little, it will soon be a matter of wonder how 
Mr. Morris has done so much with so small means. As 
I know he corresponds with you on the affairs of his 
department, I shall content myself with saying, that, be- 
fore Colonel Carrington leaves town, measures will be 
taken to enable him to make provision in future for the 
ready transportation of stores, and for the accommoda- 
tion of troops moving to the southward. It is agreed 
that the laboratory shall be removed from Richmond to 
New London. 

In my former letters upon this subject, I acquainted 
you with the reasons, which operated against Count de 
Rochambeau's detaching more than the legion of Lau- 
zun towards South Carolina, upon yom* requisition for a 
reinforcement. Although my instructions to you did 
not mention a power to call upon the Count for assist- 
ance, yet I look upon it as implied in my desire to you 
to correspond with him. The circumstances of the 
moment must determine whether any or what can be 
spared by him. 

By late advices from Europe, and from the declara- 
tions of the British ministers themselves, it appears, that 
they have done with all thoughts of an excursive war, 
and that they mean to send but small, if any further rein- 
forcements to America. It may be also tolerably plainly 
seen, that they do not mean to hold all their present 
posts, and that New York will be occupied in prefer- 
ence to any other. Hence, and from other indications, 
I am induced to beheve that an evacuation of the south- 
ern States will take place. Should this happen, we

No other reinforcement went from New York to 
South Carolina, than that of the four hundred who had 
arrived. Letters, which you had not received when 
you last wrote, will have informed you, that our first 
intelligence respecting the number of men embarked

Sir, 
Under present appearances, I think General de Choisy 
should not move beyond Charlotte Court-House. There 
are several reasons to induce a belief, that the enemy 
mean to evacuate South Carolina and Georgia. If such 
an event is to take place we must soon know it.* I re- 
quested the minister of finance to inform you, thai 
whenever it became necessary I would meet you at 
this place. Mount Vernon, exclusive of the happiness 
of entertaining you at my own house, would be very

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR 
MORRIS, AT ELIZABETHTOWN. 

Morristown, 28 March, 1782. 

Gentlemen, 

I have had intimations, that, under the idea of the 
cessation of hostilities within certain limits, a number 
of people intend to come over from New York to our 
hues. To prevent all intercourse of this kind is the 
principal design of this letter. Sir William Howe, on a 
former occasion, proposed that a neutrality should take 
place to a certain distance from the spot where our 
commissioners were to assemble, in order that they 
might not meet with any interruption in the transac- 
tion of their business, from the hostilities and alarms, 
which might otherwise have happened in the neighbour- 
hood. It was upon this principle, and for this reason, 
that the present proposal was made on my part; nor 
was it indeed, nor could it be construed, to extend any 
farther. 

It is therefore my particular desire, that no persons 
coming from the enemy be permitted to land, except 
the commissioners and those immediately connected 
with them. And, as I think it expedient, not only to 
prevent new channels of communication with the enemy 
from being opened, but as far as practicable to shut the 
former, I could wish you would take the trouble to in-

form yourselves of the practice of scnclin<f and receiv- 
ing llags on tiie lines, and point out such allenitions 
and regulations as you shall deem proper to prevent the 
evils, which have been complained of, as resulting liom 
too frequent an intercourse witii the enemy. 

I have been informed by tlie commissary of pris<^n- 
ers, that the enemy are preparing to send out a con- 
siderable quantity of goods, under the sanction of pass- 
ports granted by me for bringing out clothing and 
necessaries for the use of their prisoners. Tiiis is so 
contrary to my intention, and may be productive of such 
ill consequences, that I have sent Colonel Smith to 
explain the matter to you, and to request that you will 
examine the list, and signify what articles should be 
considered as necessaries, and what quantity ought to 
be permitted to be sent out. Mr. Skinner is directed 
to give you the necessary information. He will also 
expliiin to you the mode, which has prevailed, of mak- 
ing partial exchanges. This subject I need not recom- 
mend particularly, as it is comprehended within the lim- 
its of your commission. I have the honor to be, &,c.*

tempt, in any manner, and at such a time, as your own 
judgment shall direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is 
unnecessary to caution you against ofl'ering insult or in- 
dignity to the persons of the Prince and Admiral, should 
you be so fortunate as to capture them ; but it may not 
be amiss to press the propriety of a proper line of con- 
duct upon the party you command. 

In case of success, you will, as soon as you get them 
to a place of safety, treat them with all possible respect; 
but you are to delay no time in conveying them to

of these orders. Take care not to touch upon the 
ground, which is agreed to be neutral, namely, from 
Newark to Rahway and four miles back. Given at

OF THE ARMY.

The Commander-in-chief submits the papers accom- 
panying this, containing the case of Captain Joshua 
Huddy, lately hanged within the county of Monmouth 
in New Jersey State by a party of the enemy, to the 
consideration of the general officers of brigades and 
regiments, and thereupon requests from them, separately 
and in writing, a direct and laconic reply to the fol- 
lowing queries. 

1. Upon the state of facts in the above case, is re- 
taliadon justifiable and expedient? 

2. If justifiable, ought it to take place unmediately, or

should a previous representation be made to Sir Ikiiry 
Clinton, and satisfaction demanded from liim ? 

3. In case of representation and demand, who should 
be the person or persons to be required! 

4. In case of refusal, and retaliation becoming neces- 
sary, of what descripdon shall the otiicer be, on whom 
it is to take place ; and how shall he be designated lor 
the purpose?* 

• While commanding a small body of troops at a post on Tom's 
River in Monmouth county, New Jersey, Captain Iliuldy had been at- 
tacked by a party of refun^ees from New York, and taken prisoner after 
a gallant defence. He was conveyed to New York and put in close 
confinement. On the 12th of April he was sent out of the city, in the 
charge of a number of refugees, commanded by Captain Lippencot, and 
hanged on the heights near Middletown. The people in the neighbour- 
hood were extremely exasperated at this act of wanton barbarity ; and, at 
their solicitation. General Fonnan, who resided at Monmouth, obtained 
affidavits and a proper statement of facts, with which he first went to 
Elizabethtown, where the American commissioners, General Knox and 
Gouverncur Morris, were then attempting to negotiate an exchange of 
prisoners, and laid the matter before them. By their advice he pro- 
ceeded to General Washington's head-quarters, and his statement and the 
papers of wliich he was the bearer were submitted to the consideration 
of the general and field officers. 

Twenty-five officers sent answers to the above queries in writing. 
They were unanimous in the opinion, that retaliation was justifiable and 
expedient ; that tlie leader of the party, who murdered Captain Iluddy, 
■was the person, who ought to suffer ; and that, in case he could not bo 
obtained, an officer equal in rank to Captain Iluddy should be selected 
by lot from the British prisoners. Twenty-two of the American officers 
agreed in the decision, tliat a representation should first be made to Sir 
Henry Clinton and satisfaction demanded ; tlie other Uirce tliought, that 
tlie laws of war and the enormity of tlic offence justified an immediate 
execution, without previous notice to the British commander. 

The officers assembled at the quarters of General Hoatli, who stated 
to them the questions. He says they were ordered not to converse 
together on the subject, till each one had written his opinion, sealed it 
up, and sent it to the Commander-in-cliien — IIkath's .l/fnioiV.s-, p. .33.5. 
If tliis order was literally obeyed, the unanitnity not only in their senti- 
ments, but in the manner of expressing them, was remarkable.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR 
MORRIS, AT ELIZABETHTOWN. 

Newburg, 20 AprU, 1782. 

Gentlemen, 
I have been favored with your letter of the 16th of 
April by General Forman. Convinced from the state of 
facts, which has been exliibited to me, that justice, ex- 
pediency, and necessity requii-e, that satisfaction should 
be obtained for the murder of Captain Huddy, I have 
in the first instance made a representation to Sir Henry 
Clinton and demanded, that the officer, who command- 
ed the party, or, if he was not a captain, such a num- 
ber of agents in the execution, as are equal by tariflf 
to that rank, should be delivered up to condign pun- 
ishment. In case of refusal, I have formed the resolu- 
tion, that retaliation shall take place upon a British 
officer of equal rank. It therefore remains with the 
enemy alone to prevent this distressing alternative ; 
for, having formed my opinion upon the most mature 
reflection and deliberation, I can never recede from it. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

evidence, will bring before your Excellency the most 
wanton, unprecedented, and inhuman murder, that ever 
disgraced the arms of a civilized people.

necessary, trouhle your E.xcclluncy witli any animad- 
versions ujion this transaction. Candor obliges me to 
be explicit. To save the innocent, I demand the guilty. 
Captain Lippencot, therefore, or the ollicer who com- 
maiuled at the execution of Captain Huddy, must be 
given up ; or, if that otricer was of inferior rank to 
him, so many of the perpetrators as will, according to 
the tarirt' of exchange, be an equivalent. To do this, 
will mark the justice of your Excellency's character. 
In failure of it, I shall hold myself justifiable, in the 
eyes of God and man, for the measure to which 1 shall 
resort. 

I beg your Excellency to be persuaded, that it can- 
not be more disagreeable to you to be addressed in 
this language, than it is to me to offer it ; hut the sub- 
ject requires frankness and decision. I have to request 
your speedy determination, as my resolution is sus- 
pended but for your answer. I am, Sir, &lc.*

to the exchange of Lord Cornwallis upon any terms ; 
and that it was not till after I had combated their ob- 
jections in different ways, and at several meetings of 
their commhtees, that I got the matter placed upon such 
a footing, as to leave me at liberty to negotiate the ex- 
change of that officer at any rate. The principal diffi- 
culties are now so far removed, as to admit commis- 
sioners on each side to meet, and they are now sitting 
at Elizabeth town for the purpose of exchanges (in 
which Mr. Laurens's is particularly given in charge), 
and for settling of accounts ; and I hope, unless some 
untoward impediment should intervene in the prosecu- 
tion of this business, that you will soon meet the ac- 
complishment of your wishes. 

It has been my uniform opinion since the capitulation 
of Yorktown, that, unless the enemy can send such 
reinforcements to this continent, as will in their judg- 
ment place their two principal posts of New York and 
Charleston in a state of perfect security, or unless they 
are sure of having a naval superiority on this coast 
during the operations of the campaign, they will con- 
centre their force at one of those points ; and further 
it has as invariably been my opinion, that New York 
will be the last hold they will quit in the United States. 
If I am mistaken in the first, I shall beUeve, that a ne- 
gotiation of peace or a truce is near at hand, and, that 
they hazard much for the uti possidetis, which, from 
present appearances, and my conception of the views 
of the British government, I have not the smallest idea 
of; I mean peace this year. 

With the greatest truth and sincerity, 
I am, dear Sir, 
your most affectionate servant.

Newburg, 23 April, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

Your apprehensions, in consequence of the move- 
ment of tlie legion of Lau/un, need not be much alarm- 
ed ; the present situation of the enemy in New York, I 
am persuaded, will not aflbrd any reinforcements to 
your (juarter. 

The i-ecruits raising in the States, from which your 
army is drawn, are completing as far as cii-cumstances 
will admit, and, if needed, will be ready to go to you 
as early as the operations of the campaign are decided ; 
which, at present, from a vai'iety of circumstances, 
among which a want of intelligence from Europe is not 
the least, are held in uncertainty. The State of INIary- 
land had some time ago about three hundred men en- 
listed, and waiting only for their clothes, which have 
been sent on from Philadelphia. A number also is 
collected in Pennsylvania. But, until our information 
respecting the enemy's intentions, and their future mode 
of war, is more clearly ascertained, as well as our 
knowledge of the support and assistance, which we 
expect from our ally, it may not be well to hasten on 
the recruits to your army. You are not insensible of 
the disadvantages we have ever experienced in at- 
tempts to reinforce at your distance by land ; it having 
hitherto proved a weakening of the main army, without 
any essential augmentation to yours. 

In present circumstances, without the aid of naval 
forces and water conveyance, your own experience and 
the general knowledge you have of the country will 
readily decide upon the impracticability of transporting 
by land such heavy stores and artillery, as would be 
necessary for great operations. So that you have only

to content yourself with such a force as will be compe- 
tent to the purpose of confining the enemy to their 
lines, and prevent them from carrying their ravages into 
the country. I wait with impatience for intelligence, 
which will decide the intentions of the enemy, and fix 
the operations of the campaign on our part. This, I 
hope, is not far distant. I am, &c.

myself the pleasure to congratulate you on your safe 
return to Philadelphia in good health. The plan, which 
the Count means to offer to the consideration of Con- 
gress, appears to be pi-qjected on a liberal scale, and, 
with some explanation and perhaps alteration, may be 
well worthy of their attention. This gentleman is fully 
possessed of my sentiments on the subject of his pro- 
posals, and is at liberty to make such use of them as 
he thinks proper. He will have the honor of communi- 
cating them to your Excellency, and of informing you, 
that, as they involve political as well as military con- 
siderations, I have confined my opinion to the latter 
parts of the plan. I shall take an early occasion to

and with much personal attachment,

TO COUNT DE BIENIEWSKY. 

Nowburg, 27 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

At your request, and in consequence of a letter from 
the Chevalier de la Luzerne, 1 have given to the plan, 
which you propose to present to Congress, all the con- 
sideration I am capable of, and beg leave to observe 
thereupon, that the utility of your plan for introducing 
a legionary corps of Germans into the service of the 
United States of America depends, in my opinion, upon 
the political state of allairs in Europe, the probability 
of the war's continuing, and the mode of conducting it ; 
as also upon the time, which will be required to bring 
this corps into action. 

Of the first, I have not the means of judging, but 
I think the second is not so problematical, as to induce 
Congress to reject a contract, which, with some altera- 
tions, imd a surety of receiving the men in twelve 
months from this date, may be attended with consider- 
able advantages. 

Political considerations must, no doubt, have their in- 
fluence in determining upon a plan of this nature and 
magnitude ; and there may be an impropriety in my 
hazarding an opinion too pointedly on the policy of it ; 
but, at your request, and at the desire of the minister 
of France, 1 shall oiler my sentiments on the several 
articles in the order, in which they stand in the plan be- 
fore me. With much esteem and regard, I am. Sir, &c.* 

• The scheme proposed by Count tic Bieniewsky was, that he would 
raise in Germany and transport to America a body of troops, consisting 
of three legionary corps of cavalry, infantry, grenadiers, chasseurs, and 
artillery, the whole amounting to three thousand four hundred and eighty- 
three effective men ; that they should be subject to the orders of the 
United States, and take the oaths of fidelity and allegiance ; that he 
would agree to raise, clothe, arm, and bring them to Uie United States

TO GOVERNOR GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 27 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

Though it is by no means my opinion, that the 
enemy will divide their force and again take posses- 
sion of Rhode Island, there are some circumstances, 
which seem to carry such an appearance. I therefore 
think it would be highly imprudent, on our part, to leave 
any fortifications standing on the Island of Rhode Island, 
vvliich may be of use to them in such an event. The 
works round Newport can, under no circumstances, be 
of any advantage to us, and I must therefore request 
your Excellency to cause them to be levelled imme- 
diately. 

I am not well enough acquainted with the situation 
and nature of the work on Butts's Hill, to determine 
positively whether it ought to be destroyed or not. It 
appears to me, that, in case the enemy should reoccupy 
the island, it would be important for us to have posses- 
sion of that ground; but whether, in such an event, 
possession could be kept, your Excellency must deter- 
mine. I have no troops to spare to garrison it. If the 
work is tenable, might not a small guard be kept in it, 
and such arrangements be made, that, at the first signal 
of the appearance of a fleet, a number of militia might 
be thrown in sufficient to keep possession of it ? Should 
you think this impracticable, I would wish the works to 
be destroyed. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Dear Sir, 

Finding the commissioners appointed to licjiiidate the 
accounts of moneys due for the maintenance of pris-

support, have sepi^ated without accomplishing any tiling, 
1 think it highly expedient, that measures should be 
adopted, at this moment, for taking the German prison- 
ers of war into our service. As this measure has been 
considerably agitated, I shall not amplify upon the jus- 
tice and propriety of it, which to me seem very obvious. 
I am equally well persuaded of the policy there will be 
in augmenting every company with at least ten of these 
men, or more if they can be obtained ; for I am 
convinced, that, by such an uacorporation, they will 
make exceedingly cheap and valuable recruits, and, be- 
ing able-bodied and disciplined men, they will give a 
strength and solidity to our regiments, which they will 
not otherwise acquire this campaign. All my accounts 
respecting the recruiting service are unfavorable ; in- 
deed, not a single recruit has arrived, to my knowledge, 
from any State except Rhode Island, in consequence 
of the requisitions of Congress in December last. 

Should the plan be adopted by Congress, the sooner 
it is carried into execution the better. In that case, I 
think the men ought to be recruited for the continent, 
and not carried to the credit of the quotas of the State 

for Uie American cause," say the committee, " which the author of it 
professes, and which tlie generous terms of the plan evince, have not 
failed to inspire a just esteem for his character and a disposition to favor 
his wishes. Considerations, however, which in no respect derogate from 
this esteem or this disposition, render it expedient for Congress to de- 
cline the offer, which has been made to them." — Jounials, May Wlli.

with whose lines they are to serve. For, without mak- 
ing any alteration in the establishment, they may be 
annexed to the regiments in such a manner, that they 
can be formed into distinct corps whenever their fidelity 
and attachment shall be sufficiently evinced, if circum- 
stances should then require it. All the matters of 
bounty and encouragement being arranged with the 
financier, and the particulars of the scheme adjusted, 
as soon as provision shall be made for their subsistence 
on the journey, I would detach a captain and subaltern 
from every regiment, to receive and conduct them to 
the army, so that they may certainly join the respective 
regiments, at farthest, by the 1st of June. In the in- 
terim, I would beg leave to propose, lest the enemy 
should attempt to counteract the design, that the busi- 
ness should be kept secret, undl it is ripe for execution ; 
and then be negotiated by some gendemen of address 
appointed for the purpose. I request an answer as 
speedily as possible. I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

Newburg, 28 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

I receive with much gratitude the remembrance and 
comphments of the principal officers of the French 
army in Virginia, and thank your Excellency for the 
trouble of being the bearer of them to me, and of the 
letter from Count de Rochambeau. 

With equal sensibility and pleasm-e I received the 
communications from your court, and now acknowledge 
my obligations to your Excellency for them. Though 
not decisive, they are nevertheless important. The late 
instance of their generous aid, hinted at by your Ex-

celleiK-y and particiiliu-ized by Mr. IMorris, is one among 
a variety of important considerations, wliich ought to 
bind America to France in bonds of indelible Iriend- 
sliip and gratitude, never, I iio[)o, to be sundered.* In- 
duced by that entire conlidencc, which I repose in 
your Excellency, and a lull conviction that a nation, 
which combines her force with ours for purposes of 
all others most interesting to humanity, ought not to be 
deficient in any information I can give to ailapt ob- 
jects to means, that an accordance of them may be in- 
separable, I shall without hesitation exhibit to you our 
present force, and my ideas of the increase of it by 
recruits, according to the best view of it which lies be- 
fore me. 

It can scarcely be necessary to inform your Excel- 
lency, that our military establishment for the present 
year consists of four regiments of artillery, four legion- 
ary and two partisan corps, and fifty regiments of in- 
fantry, besides the corps of invalids ; or that Congress 
have called in pointed terms upon each State to com- 
plete its regiments to the establishment, the aggregate 
of which, if complied with, would amount to thirty-four 
thousand three hundred and eight men, exclusive of 
commissioned officers, sergeants, and music, Hazen's 
regiment, and the corps of invalids. Of this force, one 
legiomrv corps, two regiments of artillery, and twenty- 
two of infantry, besides Ilazen's regiment and the in- 
valids, compose the northern army. But as Hazen's 

* Alluding to a loan of six millions of livrcs, which, after hearing of 
the capitulation at Yorktown, the King of France had resolved to make 
to the United States within the coming year ; although, previously to 
that event, M. de la Luzerne had been instructed to inform Congress in 
positive terms, that no more money could bo expected from France. It 
was thought expedient not to make this intelligence public for a time, 
lest it should diminish the efforts of the people in providing for the con- 
tinuance of the war. See above, p. 230.

regiment is fostered by no State, discouraged from re- 
cruiting by all, and without funds, it must soon dwin- 
dle to nothing, being now very weak. 

The present totality of the rank and file, exclusive 
of sergeants, of the regiments composing the north- 
ern army, amounts to nine thousand one hundred and 
forty-six. From this number the sick, men in different 
branches of the staff department, and such as are em- 
ployed on other extra duties, whom the pecuUarity of 
our circumstances compels me to furnish from the ar- 
my, being deducted, will reduce the efficient operating 
force of these corps to seven thousand five hundred 
and fifty-three rank and file ; and I should be uncandid 
if I were not to acknowledge, that I do not expect it 
will be increased by recruits in the course of the cam- 
paign to more than ten thousand fit for duty in the 
field. This, Sir, in my opinion, will be the full amount 
of the established regiments of the States east of 
Pennsylvania. To ascertain the number of militia, 
which may be assembled for occasional offensive ope- 
rations, is more than I can do. The general opinion 
is, that there will be no want of militia for any enter- 
prise we can have in view. Be this as it may, this 
one thing is certain, that militia are not only slow in 
their movements, but, undertaking to judge also of the 
propriety of them, will wait till the necessity for acting 
strikes them; which, in most cases, is as injurious to 
the service as inability or want of inclination ; disap- 
pointment being the consequence of delay. This ob- 
servation I could not refrain from making, because, in 
all combined operations, especially those which may 
depend upon the season or a limited period for their 
execution, it is of the utmost importance to know the 
fact. 

The enclosed return, which is a copy of the last state 



o 



Part 11.) TlIK A M K R 1 CA iN R INVOLUTION. 275 

of the force under the orders of Mujor-Gcaeral Greene 
that has come to my hands, will give your Excellency 
every information in my power respecting the state 
and condition of that ai-my ; which was to be aug- 
mented by the partisan corps of Colonel Armand, con- 
sisting of about two hundred horse and foot. Inde- 
pendently of those, theie are two small legiments at 
Fort Pitt, one from the State of Pennsylvania, the other 
from Virginia, which are included in the general estab- 
hshmcnt of the army ; but no partirular return is here 
given of them. 

What measures are adopted by the States of Geor- 
gia and North and South Carolina to recruit their bat- 
talions, I know not. Virginia marched about four hun- 
dred men near the end of February for the southern 
army, and, by an act of the legislature passed at their 
last session, resolved to raise more ; but in what for- 
wardness they are, or what is to be expected from the 
act, I am equally uninformed. Maryland and Pennsyl- 
vania depend upon voluntary enlistments, and are pro- 
ceeding very slowly in the business of recruiting, es- 
pecially the latter. It is impossible for me, therefore, 
to say to what number that army will be increased. 

This, Sir, is an accurate state of the force we have 
at present, and my expectation of what it may be, in- 
dependent of militia. 

The enemy's force, from the best information I have 
been able to obtain of it, may stand thus. At New 
York, regulars, including their established corps of pro- 
vincials, rank and file, nine thousand ; militia of the city, 
refugees, and independent companies, four thousand ; 
(sailors and marines, according to the number of ships, 
which may be in the harbour, and, this being uncertain, 
no number is given ;) at Charleston about three thou- 
sand three hundred ; at Savannah about seven hundred. 



276 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 50. 



In Canada, including British, German, and established 
provincials, five thousand ; at Penobscot about five hun- 
dred ; at Halifax and its dependencies, uncertain, say 
three thousand five hundred ; in all, twenty- six thou- 
sand. 

The above estimate, so far as it respects New York, 
Charleston, and Savannah, is I beUeve to be depended 
upon. The force in Canada by some accounts is more, 
by others less, than five thousand. The regular British 
and German troops in that country cannot exceed four 
thousand ; but, in addition to these, are the corps of 
Sir John Johnson and others, which I am told have 
been considerably increased by the disaffected of this 
and other States, who have fled to Canada. But it is 
to be observed, that this force, be it what it may, is 
employed in the occupation of posts between Quebec 
and Michilimackinac, and on Lake Champlain, through 
an extent of not less than seven or eight hundred 
miles, and that all these posts are dependent upon the 
first for provision and supplies of every kind. I am 
less certain of the enemy's force in Nova Scotia than 
elsewhere. The number here given is not from re- 
cent intelligence, and may be erroneous, as their gar- 
risons are w^eakened or strengthened according to cir- 
cumstances. Cumberland, Windsor, Annapolis, and St. 
John's River are posts dependent upon Halifax, and 
included in the three thousand five hundred men here 
mentioned. 

If this state of matters be satisfactory to you, or 
useful in the formation of any plans against the com- 
mon enemy, I shall be very ha]5py in having given it. 

Permit me now. Sir, to express the high sense I 
have of the honor you have done me in communicat- 
ing the favorable opinion entertained of my conduct 
by the coui-t and nation of France, and to acknow-

ledge my obligation to those oflicers, who have in- 
spired these sentiments. To stand well in the eyes 
ol" a nation, which I view as one of the lirst in the 
world, and in the opinion of a monarch, whom I con- 
sider as the supporter of the rights of humanity, and 
to whom I am personally indebted for the command 
he has been pleased to honor me with, is highly llat- 
tering to my vanity, at the same time it has a first 
claim to all my gratitude.* It is unnecessary, I hope, 
to add fresh assurances of the respect and esteem, 
with which I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL KNOX AND OOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Newburg, 30 April, 1782. 

Gentlemen, 

It is with great pleasure, that I make use of the 

earliest occasion to acknowledge the receipt of your 

several despatches by Colonel Smith, which contain 

an ample account of your proceedings in consequence 

* From M. de la Luzerne^s Letter. — " I cannot deny myself tlie pleas- 
ure of informing you of the sentiments, witJi which the reports of the 
French officers, on their return to Versailles, inspired the court and na- 
tion towards your Excellency. Their testimony can add nothing to the 
universal opinion respecting the great services, which you have render- 
ed to your country ; but, to the esteem and admiration of the French, 
will henceforth be added a sentiment of affection and attachment, whicli 
is a just return for the attentions our officers have received from you, 
and for the progress they have made in their profession by ser^'ing un- 
der your orders." — AprU 18<A. 

Dr. Franklin wrote to Mr. Livingston, secretary of foreign affairs ; — 
" The French officers, who have returned to France this winter, speak 
of our people in the handsomest and kindest manner ; and there is a 
strong desire in many of the young noblemen to go over to fight for 
us ; there is no restraining some of them ; and several changes in the 
officers of their army have taken place in consequence." — Passy,

of the commission you were charged with by me. I 
have also received from Sir Henry Clmton an abstract 
of the same negotiations, as stated by his commission- 
ers. From the whole aspect of the matter, 1 have lit- 
de doubt, that the reasons you mention, as the ope- 
rating principles with the enemy, have been the real 
cause of defeating the success of a negotiation so de- 
sirable in itself, and which promised to be so benefi- 
cial in its consequences, I have transmitted to Con- 
gress a copy of your report, and have submitted solely 
to their decision the subject of future exchanges ; not 
less lamenting the unreasonableness of our enemies, 
than regretting the miseries of war, which may be aug- 
mented and protracted by such unreasonable conduct.* 
I should do injustice to my own feelings on this oc- 
casion, if I did not express something beyond my bare 
approbation of the attention, address, and abihty ex- 
hibited by you, Gendemen, in the course of this te- 
dious and fruitless negotiation. The want of having 
succeeded in the great objects of your mission does 

* The British commissioners were General Dalrymple and Mr. Andrew 
Elliot. Three principal points were brought into discussion ; a cartel for 
a general exchange of prisoners ; a liquidation of all accounts on both 
sides for the maintenance of prisoners ; and provision for their future 
support. In Sir Henry Clinton's letter to Washington, stating the re- 
sults of the negotiation as reported by his commissioners, he complains 
that the Americans made unreasonable demands ; first, in requiring him 
to agree to an exchange of prisoners in all parts of the world, whereas 
it was known, that his powers extended to such only as had been cap- 
tured in America ; secondly, in an exorbitant requisition of two hun- 
dred thousand pounds sterling, as the balance due to the United States 
for the maintenance of British prisoners, from the beginning of hostili- 
ties to that time, whereas, in Sir Henry's opinion, the balance was 
greatly in his favor; and, thirdly, in demanding, that, for the future, 
provisions should not be purcliasod in the United States for the sup- 
port of British prisoners, but should be sent to them from the British 
posts. On these essential points, as well as on many others of less mo- 
ment, the difference of opinion was so great that no arrangement could 
be effected. See Sparks's Life of Gouverneur Morris, Vol. I. p. SJ42.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF COXGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 30 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
copies of the minutes of proceedings and the report 
of my commissioners appointed to meet commissioners 
on the pai-t of the British general, Sir Henry Clinton, 
for the purposes mentioned in their instructions, a copy 
of which is herewith communicated. A private letter 
from my commissioners, and a letter from Sir Henry 
Clinton, both written in consequence of this negotia- 
tion, are also enclosed for the consideration of Congress. 

After this exposition of the subject it is unneces- 
sary, and it might be improper, for me to malce any 
observations on these papers. I submit them to the 
wisdom of Congress, and have only to beg for my 
own direction, that I may be early informed of their 
determination, how far any future exchanges of pris- 
oners of war shall be continued, under the practice 
which has been formerly adopted for that purpose. I 
beg leave to point the attention of Congress particu- 
larly to that part of the commissioners' letter to me, 
which mentions the extension of a p;u-don to the refu- 
gees in the service of the enemy. Their ideas on this

subject are so perfectly consonant to my own, ibmied 
on the principles of policy and expediency, that 1 can- 
not omit to notice it, and to submit to the consider- 
ation of Congress, whether the adopting of this meas- 
ure under proper restrictions may not be attended wilh 
happy consequences to our cause, and be equally pro- 
ductive of ruin and confusion to the British interest in 
America. Lamenting that the benevolence of my in- 
tentions has been so totally defeated, by the unhappy 
and fruitless issue of this negodation, I have only to 
add, that, with the most perfect regard, I am, &c. 



TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL HAZEN. 

Head-Quarters, 3 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

The enemy, persisting in that barbarous line of con- 
duct, which they have pursued during the course of 
this war, have lately most inhumanly executed Captain 
Joshua Huddy, of the Jersey State troops, taken pris- 
oner by them at a post on Tom's River ; and in con- 
sequence I have written to the British Commander- 
in-chief, that, unless the perpetrators of that horrid 
deed were dehvered up, I should be under the dis- 
agreeable necessity of retaliating, as the only means left 
to put a stop to such inhuman proceedings. 

You will, therefore, immediately on receipt of this, 
designate by lot for the above purpose a British cap- 
tain, who is an unconditional prisoner, if such a one is 
in your possession ; if not, a lieutenant under the same 
circumstances from among the prisoners at any of the 
posts, either in Pennsylvania or Maryland. So soon 
as you have fixed on the person, you will send him 
under a safeguard to Philadelphia, where the minister

duct him to the place of liis destination. 

For your intbrniation respeciing the ollicers, who are 
prisoners in our possession, I have ordered tiie com- 
missary of prisoners tt) fiirnisii you with a list of them. 
It will be forwarded with this. I need not mention to 
you, that every possible tenderness, that is consistent 
with the security of him, should be shown to the per- 
son whose unfortunate lut ii may be to sulFer.

TO LIEUTE>A>'T-GEXKUAL JAMES UOBEKTSON.* 

Head-Quarters, 4 May, 1762. 

Sir, 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 
Ist instant. Your Excellency is acquainted with the 
determination expressed in my letter of the 21st of 
April to Sir Henry Clinton. I have now to inform you, 
that, so far from receding from that resolution, orders 
are given to designate a British officer for retaliation. 
The time and p'.;ce are fixed ; but I still hope the re- 
sult of your couii-martial will prevent this dreadful al- 
ternative. 

Sincerely lamenting the cruel necessity, which alone 
can induce so distressing a measure in the present in- 
stance, I do assure your Excellency, that I am as 
earnestly desirous as you can be, that the war may be

licited his recall, and at length tlie King granted him permission to return

about a week, when Sir Guy Carleton arrived in New York, and took 
command of the British armies in America, as the permanent successor 
of Sir Henry Clinton.

carried on agreeably to the rules, which humanity form- 
ed, and the example of the politest nations recom- 
mends, and shall be extremely happy in agreeing with 
you to prevent or punish every breach of the rules of 
war within the spheres of our respective commands. 

I am unacquainted with the circumstances of the de- 
tention of Badgely and Hatfield. The matter shall be 
exammed into and justice done ; but I must inform you, 
that in my opinion deserters, or characters, who for the 
crimes they have committed are amenable to the civil 
pov.'er, cannot on either side be protected under the 
sanction of a flag. I do not pretend to say, that the 
abovementioned persons are in that predicament. 

Recrimination would be useless. I forbear, therefore, 
to mendon numerous instances, which have stained the 
reputation of your arms, marked the progress of this 
war with unusual severity, and disgraced the honor of 
human nature itself. While I wave this ungrateful dis- 
cussion, I repeat the assertion, that it is my most ar- 
dent desire, not only to soften the inevitable calamides 
of war, but even to introduce on every occasion as 
great a share of tenderness and humanity, as can pos- 
sibly be exercised in a state of hostility.

Dear Sir, 
By the letter to Brigadier-General Hazen, which I 
have enclosed to you under a flying seal for your in- 
spection, you will observe the distressing alternative to 
which we are at last reduced. I must request you will 
give that letter a safe and speedy conveyance.

As soon as the British officer, whose unfortunate lot 
it is to be desij^natcd as the object of retaliation, shall 
arrive in Fliihulel[)hia, it will be necessary to have a 
suflicient escort, under the command of a very dis- 
creet and vigilant ollicer, in readiness to receive and 
conduct him to the cantonment of the New Jersey 
troops. I pray you will be pleased to give the orders 
proper for the occasion, and direct the officer com- 
manding the party to apply to the commandant of the 
Jersey line, who will have final instructions respecting 
the matter. 

Keenly wounded as my feelings will be, at the de- 
plorable destiny of the unhappy victim, no gleam of 
hope can arise to him but fiom the conduct of the 
enemy themselves. This he may be permitted to 
communicate to the British Commander-in-chief, in 
whose power alone it rests to avert the impending 
vengeance from the innocent by executing it on the 
guilty. At the same time it may be announced, that 
I will receive no application nor answer any letter on 
the subject, which does not inform me that ample sat- 
isfaction is made for the death of Captain Huddy on 
the perpetrators of that horrid deed.

TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Circular to the States. 

Head-Quarters, 4 May, 1782. 

Sir, 
I find myself arrived at that period, at which I hoped 
to have seen the battalions of the several States com- 



284 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 50. 

pleted to their establishment, in conformity to the re- 
quisitions of Congress of the 19th of December last. 

The enclosed retui-ns of recruits, which I have caus- 
ed to be made up to the 1st instant, will show how 
totally short of my expectations the exertions of the 
States have fallen. From your State you will find that 
only recruits have joined the army in conse- 

quence of the above requisition. 

All my accounts from Europe concur in declaring, 
that the British King and ministers are still determined 
to prosecute the war. It becomes, therefore, our de- 
cided duty to be prepared to meet these hostile in- 
tentions, in whatever way they are to be can-ied into 
execution ; to do which, our utmost exertions are now 
called for. You ■will suffer me therefore to entreat, 
that, if your State has any expectation from the mili- 
tary operations of this season, not another moment may 
be lost in providing for and carrying into most effec- 
tual execution the full completion of its battalions. It 
is scarcely necessary to inform you, that on this ex- 
pectation all our calculations must be formed, and on 
this event must rest the hopes of the ensuing cam- 
paign. 

My intelligence of the actual aid we may expect 
from our allies is not yet so explicit as to lead me to 
decide absolutely on the mode of operations for this 
campaign ; but w^ere our expectations of support from 
that quarter ever so promising, yet, from the negligence 
and languor of the States, from whence our own ex- 
ertions are to spring, I am not at this day enabled to 
give any assurance of our being prepared to cooperate 
with our allies in any great objects equal to their ex- 
pectations or our own ability. I am sorry to acquaint 
your Excellency, that I have the best authority to assure 
you, that the court of France is much dissatisfied with 



Part ll.J T 11 K A .M i; 11 1 C A iN R i: V O L U T 1 O N. 285 

this want of vigor and exertion in tlic Slates, and with 
that dispusition, which apiicar-s willing at least, il' nut 
desirous, to cast all tlie burthen of the American war 
upon them. Waving the injustice and impolicy of such 
a temper, wliich to me appear very conspicuous, how 
humiliating is the idea, that our dependence lor support 
should rest on others, beyond the point which abso- 
lute necessity dictates; hew discouraging to our allies, 
and how dishonorable to ourselves must be our want 
of vigor and utmost exertion, at a time when, if we 
are not wanting to ourselves, our prospects are the fair- 
est that our wishes could extend to. 

I find from the proceedings of the several States, 
that their calculation of dehciencies, formed on appli- 
cation to the several towns, which furnish the men, are 
greatly different from the returns sent from the army. 
I forbear mentioning many reasons, which might be as- 
signed to produce this diHerence, and which in my 
opinion originate principally within the States, and will 
content myself with this one observation, that, should 
the States deceive themselves in this respect, and fail 
to furnish the expected force in the field, they will not 
only cast an essential injury upon the army, but the 
unhappy consequences of a tailure in their expecta- 
tions from a military operation will return upon them- 
selves, whilst recrimination can have no effect towards 
alleviating our protracted misfortunes and distress. 

Although money matters are not within the line of 
my duty, yet, as they are so intimately connected with 
all military operations ; and being lately informed by the 
financier in answer to some small requisitions upon 
him, that he has not yet received one penny in money 
from any one State, upon the requisition of Congress 
for the eight millions of dollars, but that, on the con- 
trary, some of the States are devising ways to draw 



286 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 



from him the small sums he has been able otherwise 
to establish, and that he is at this time barely able to 
feed the army, and that from hand to mouth ; I cannot 
forbear to express my apprehensions from that quar- 
ter, and to urge, with the warmth of zeal and earnest- 
ness, the most pointed and effectual attention of your 
State to the actual raising and collecting of its propor- 
tion of the requisition. Upon the present plan of non- 
compHance with requisitions for men and supplies, let 
me seriously ask your Excellency, How is it possible for 
us to continue the war ? How is it possible to support 
an army in money or recruits ? To what a wretched 
state must we soon be reduced? How dangerous is it 
to suffer our affairs to run at hazard, and to depend 
upon contingencies ? To what do the present measures 
tend, but to the utter ruin of that cause, which we 
have hitherto so long and nobly supported, and to 
crush all the fair hopes, which the present moment 
places before us, were we only to exert the power and 
abilities with which Providence has bountifully blessed 
this country ? But if the States will not impose, or do 
not collect and apply, taxes for support of the war, the 
sooner we make terms the better ; the longer we con- 
tinue a feeble and ineffectual war, the greater will be 
our distress at the houi- of submission. For my own 
part, I am fully convinced, that, without the means of 
execution, no officer, whoever he may be, who is 
placed at the head of the military department, can be 
answerable for the success of any plans he may pro-

Upon this subject I will only add, that, from past 
experience and from present prospects, I am persuaded, 
that, if the States would furnish the supplies agreeably 
to the late requisition, and would suffer the pay, cloth- 
ing, and subsistence of the army to go through one

common channel, two tliirtls of their former expenses 
would be saved ; and many partialities, discontents, and 
jealousies, which now subsist, would be removed and 
cease, and an establishment of order, regularity, and 
harmony in our general alVairs would be experienced, 
which ciuinot arise from the present disjointed and dif- 
ferent systems of fmance adopted by separate States. 

While acting in my milittuy capacity, I am sensible 
of the impropriety of stepping into the line of civil 
polity. INIy anxiety for the general good, and an earn- 
est desire to bring this long protracted war to a hap- 
py issue, when I hope to retire to that peaceful state 
of domestic pleasures,, from which the call of my coun- 
try has brought me to take an active part, and to 
which I most ardently wish a speedy return, I trust 
will furnish my excuse with your Excellency and the 
legislature, while I request your pardon for this tres- 
pass. I have the honor to be, &,c. 

P. S. JMuij 8th. — Since writing the above, I have 
been furnished with sundry New York papers, and an 
English paper, containing the last intelligence from 
England, with the debates of Parliament upon several 
motions made respecting the American war. Lest 
your Excellency may not have been favored with so 
full a sight of these papers as I have been, I take the 
liberty to mention, that I have perused these debates 
with great attention and care, with a view if possible 
to penetrate their real design ; and, upon the most ma- 
ture deliberation I can bestow, I am obliged to de- 
clare it as my candid opinion, that the measures of 
the enemy in all their views, so far as they respect 
America, are merely delusory, (they having no serious 
intention to admit our independence upon its true prin- 
ciples), and are calculated to produce a change of min-

isters to quiet the minds of their own people, and re- 
concile them to a continuance ot" the war; while they 
are meant to amuse this country with a false idea of 
peace, to draw us off from our connexion with France, 
and to lull us into a state of security and inactivity, 
which having taken place, the ministry will be left to 
prosecute the war in other parts of the world with 
greater vigor and efTect. Your Excellency will permit 
me on this occasion to observe, that, even if the na- 
tion and Parliament are really in earnest to obtain 
peace with America, it will undoubtedly be wisdom 
in us to meet them with great caution and circum- 
spection, and by all means to keep our arms firm in 
our hands, and, instead of relaxing one iota in our ex- 
ertions, rather to spring forward with redoubled vigor, 
that we may take the advantage of every favorable 
opportunity, until our wishes are fully obtained. No 
nation ever yet suffered in treaty by preparing, even in 
the moment of negotiation, most vigorously for the field. 
The industry, which the enemy are using to propa- 
gate their pacific reports, appears to me a circumstance 
very suspicious ; and the eagerness, with which the peo- 
ple as I am informed are catching at them, is in my 
opinion equally dangerous.

America. This information I have from his own letter. 

Port Mahon, aiul the whole isliind of Minorca, arc 
certainly surremlcred to his Catholic Majesty's arms. 
This event is deckued in New York ; but I am pos- 
sessed of but few pai'ticulars concerning the capitula- 
tion. My most cordial congratulations attend your Ex- 
cellency, and the ollicers of your army, upon the favors, 
which you inform me have, with so much justice, been 
conferred by his Most Christian Majesty.* Be as- 
sured, Sir, I shall ever feel a most hvely interest and 
pleasure in every event, which bestows honor or emolu- 
ment on such deserving characters. The favorable 
mention, which the King is pleased to make of me, 
demands my warmest and most particular acknowledg- 
ments. This honor done me will form an additional 
tie to the gratitude, which already binds me to the 
person and interests of his Majesty. 

Convinced that the works at Newport would be of 
no use to us, and that they might be of infinite im- 
portance to the enemy, should they have an intention 
to establish a post there, from a bare apprehension of 
such an event I iiavc requested the governor of Rhode 
Island to have them levelled ; pointing him at the same 
time to the necessity of preserving Butts's Hill, if possi- 
ble. The plans for the campaign depending entirely 
upon the succours, which will be sent by his Most 
Christian Majesty, I can do nothing more than form 
opinions upon certain hypotheses. If we should have a

of Elk, the route you propose for their march by land 
is, I am persuaded, the best that can be. It is to be 
feared, that the manoeuvre your Excellency suggests 
will hardly have its intended effect, as it will be per- 
formed in so short a space, as to give no time for its 
operation, before the deception you propose would be 
disclosed. 

If your march should take place before our intended 
interview, the time of its commencement must be de- 
termined absolutely by your Excellency, in consequence 
of the advice you ma}^ receive from your court, and of 
knowing the time at which the succours may be ex- 
pected on this coast. To delay it beyond this point 
would waste the campaign ; and to commence at an 
earlier period Avould disclose our plans and prepare 
the enemy for an approach. Every attention, consist- 
ent with my means, has been bestowed on the boats, 
and I hope to be tolerably provided with them. 

I shall, by this opportunity, communicate your request 
for militia to Governor Harrison.* I persuade myself, 
that, knowing how expensive the militia are, and with 
what difficulty they are drawn out, you will be as 
moderate as possible in your requisition, and, that you 
will leave nothing, when it can well be avoided, to 
their protection. I am, &c.

diT of Captain Joshua HinKly, ol the Jersey State 
troops, by a party of refugees from New York, I ini- 
mediately informed the British commander-in-chief, 
that, unless he delivered up the perpetrators of that 
horrid deed, 1 should he reduced to die disagreeable 
necessity of retaliating. 

In answer to my letter the British general informs 
me, that a court-martial is ordered for the trial of the 
persons complained of; but at the same time says, that 
those people ofl'er, in justification of the fact, a number 
of instances of cruelty committed by us, and particularly 
in Monmouth county. Though this is by no means 
admitted, but on the contrary orders are given to desig- 
nate and send to camp a British olliccr, who, if my de- 
mand is not complied witii, will be executed ; yet I 
cannot forbear observing to your Excellency, that, whilst 
I demand satisfaction from the enemy for the violences 
they commit, it becomes us to be particularly careful, 
that they have not a like claim on us ; and I must beg 
you to make it known to all persons acting in a military- 
capacity in your State, that I shall hold myself obliged 
to deliver up to the enemy, or otherwise to punish, 
such of them as shall commit any act, which is in the 
least contrary to the laws of war. I doubt not of your 
doing the same with those, who come under the civil 
power. 

The enemy also complain of the detention of Hat- 
field and Badgely, who, they say, were out by direc- 
tion of our commissaiy of prisoners under sanction of 
a flag. I must beg your Excellency to inform me, as 
soon as possible, of the circumstances attending their 
capture, and the causes of their detention. If those 
causes are not strictly just, I could wish they were 
sent in. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Head-Quarters, 8 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor 
of the 24th of April, enclosing a copy of your letter to 
Congress on the subject of American prisoners confin- 
ed in England, with your sentiments on the necessity 
of retaliation. 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that a meet- 
ing of commissioners, which had among other matters 
been concerted for the purposes of a general exchange, 
comprehending a release of our countrymen prisoners 
in Europe, as well as others, has unhappily been dis- 
solved, without effecting any one of those benevolent 
purposes, which were the object, on our part, of their 
mission. This circumstance, I feai', will be a means 
of placing any future exchanges at a great distance. 
No measure, however, in my power shall be omitted to 
effect so desirable an event. 

I have the honor to concur in sentiment with your 
Excellency on the subject of retaliation, and to inform 
you, that the circumstances attending the death of Cap- 
tain Huddy are likely to bring that matter to a point. 
A demand has been made by me for the principal 
perpetrators of that horrid deed. The reply to this 
demand, received from General Robertson, is not satis- 
factory. I have therefore informed him, that orders are 
given to designate by lot a British officer of the rank 
of Captain Huddy for retaliation ; that the time and 
place for his execution are fixed ; and that nothing can 
stay my resolution from being carried into complete 
effect, but a strict compliance with my first requisition. 
General Robertson's answer will bring this ungrateful 
business to an issue. 1 have the honor to be, &c.

TO TIIK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 10 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
the enclosed papers. They contain a continuance of 
the correspondence, whicii has been produced between 
me, General Robertson, and Sir Henry Clinton, in the 
case of Captain IKuIdy. That from Sir Henry did 
not come to hand till some days after the receipt 
of General Robertson's letter, and after my reply to 
tlic laUrr. 1 am in daily expectation of an answer from 
General Robertson, which I hope will bring this un- 
grateful business to a conclusion. 

I take this opportunity to convey to Congress sundry 
English and New York newspapers, which have within 
a few days past been put into my hands. Their con- 
tents are new and interesting, and I talie the earliest 
occasion to present them to Congress. 

Although I view the debates, so far as they import 
proposals of pacification to America, to be idle and delu- 
sory, yet 1 cannot Imt express my fears for the effect 
they may have upon tlie exertions of the States, which 
are already too feeble and void of energy. The people, 
so far as I am informed, are catching at the idea of 
peace with great eagerness ; and the industry which 
the enemy are using for its propagation is to me a very 
suspicious circumstance. For my own part, I view 
our situation such, that, instead of relaxing, we ought to 
improve the present moment as the most favorable to 
our wishes. The British nation appear to me to be 
staggered and almost ready to sink beneath the accu- 
mulating weight of debt and misfortune. If we follow 
the blow with vigor and energy, I think the game is 
our own. 



294 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

Just as I was closing these despatches, I received a 
letter from Sir Guy Carleton, covering sundry printed 
papers, a copy of which, with the papers, I have now 
the honor to enclose to your Excellency, with the copy 
of my answer to him ; and I flatter myself, that my 
conduct therein will be agreeable to the wishes of Con- 
gress.* I have the honor to be, &c. 

* See Sir Guy Carleton's letter, dated May 7th, in the Appendtx, 
No. IX. — The papers enclosed in the letter were printed copies of the 
proceedings of the House of Commons, on the 4th of March, 1782, 
respecting an address to the King in favor of peace ; and also a copy 
of the bill reported in consequence thereof, enabling his Majesty to con- 
clude a peace or truce with the revolted colonies in North America. 

The French cabinet were somewhat concerned as to the effect, which 
these movements of the British Parliament might have in America. As 
soon as they were known at Versailles, Count de Vergennes wrote to 
M. de la Luzerne expressing his apprehensions. 

"The object of the British King," said he, "in acceding to these resolu- 
tions, is obvious. He would persuade the Americans, that he is sincerely 
disposed to a reconciliation, and would spare nothing to impress this per- 
suasion by influencing their feelings towards England, and causing them 
to be unfaithful to France. On examining the comparative situation of 
England and America, one could hardly hesitate to decide what impres- 
sion these resolutions should make ; yet the strong propensity of the 
Americans to inactivity ; their need of peace and the desire they manifest 
for it ; the embarrassment as to their means of continuing the war ; the 
great number of English partisans among them ; all these causes united 
are enough to excite the fear, that the wishes of the people may prevail 
over the patriotism and zeal of Congress, and that this body will be forced 
to lend an ear to the pretended pacific overtures of the court of London. 
Such a step would of course be infinitely disagreeable to France, be- 
cause it would effectually cliange tlie object and mode of prosecuting 
the war ; it would augment the hostile resources of England, and would 
cause France to lose a great part of the fruit of her offensive efforts in 
carrying on the war for the independence of America. It is therefore 
of the highest importance, that the United States sliould continue of the 
same principles as heretofore, remain immovably attached to the alliance, 
and follow the example of France in refusing to listen to a separate 
peace with England. Every principle of honor and interest requires this 
conduct in the Americans. 

" It should not be concealed from you, that the English ministry have 
recently sent a secret emissary to us, with propositions for a separate 
peace. The conditions, which he offered, were such as would have satis- 
fied the King, if he had been without allies. He stipulated, among other

TO SIR GUY CAKLKTO.V. 

llead-Quartcrs, 10 May, 1782. 

Sir, 
I luid the honor last evening to receive your Excel- 
lency's letter of the 7tli, with the several papers en- 
closed. Ever since the commencement of tliis unnatu- 

thinnfs, the uli possidetis, the suppression of tlio English commission at 
Dunkirk, and advantnjjos in India. But these offers did not move the 
King. His Majesty acknowledges no other rule, than that which is traced 
in his engagements ; and lie answered, that, however ardent might be his 
wishes for the ret-stablishnicnt of peace, he could not commence a ne- 
gotiation to that end without the participation of his allies. The English 
commissioner replied, that he perfectly imderstood this answer to refer 
to America, as well as Spain, but objected, tliat recognising the inde- 
pendence of the colonies did not enter into the system of England. I 
replied, that this was tlie basis of the system of the King. Upon this 
he asked, if there was no mode of treating with France without in- 
volving the affairs of .America. I sent to him for answer tlie first pacific 
overtures, which we had communicated to the mediators. I added, that, 
whether England should treat of the affairs of America with us, or hold a 
direct negotiation with the United States, she could not avoid treating 
with the deputies of Congress ; and thus she would be compelled to 
recognise tlie authority of that body. I cannot say whether any thing 
will result from this advance on the part of the English ministry, or 
whetlier it was meant as an apple of discord between us and our allies ; 
but, whatever may have been the intention, tlie issue ought at least to be 
a new and strong proof to the .Americans of the fidelity of the King to 
his engagements, and to convince them of the extreme injustice of de- 
viating from his example." — j\lS. Letter from Vergennes to Luzerne, 
Versailles, March 2Sd, 1762. 

A few days aftenvards, in writing again upon the same subject, Count 
de Vergennes said ; 

" Altliough we desire that Congress may neither open a direct negotia- 
tion, nor make a separate peace, yet we have no wish to prevent that body 
from following the system, which we ourselves have traced in our answer 
to tlie mediating courts. We are and always shall be disposed to con- 
sent, that the .American plenipotentiaries in Europe shall treat, in con- 
formity to their instructions, directly and without our intervention, with 
those from the court of London, while we shall be engaged in a negotia- 
tion on our part ; provided that the two negotiations shall proceed with 
an I'qual progress, that the two treaties shall be signed at tlie same time, 
and that neither of them shall take effect without the otlier." — MS. Let-

ral war, my conduct has borne invariable testimony 
against those inhuman excesses, which, in too many 
instances, have marked its various progress. With re- 
spect to a late transaction, to which I presume your 
Excellency alludes, I have already expressed my reso- 
lution, a resolution formed on the most mature delibera- 
tion, and from which I shall not recede. I have to 
inform your Excellency, that your request of a pass- 
port for Mr. Morgann, to go to Philadelphia, shall be 
conveyed to Congress by the earUest opportunity ; and 
I will embrace the first moment, that I shall have it in 
my power, to communicate to you their determination 
thereon. 

Many inconveniences and disorders having arisen 
from an improper admission of flags at various posts of 
the two armies, which have given rise to complaints on 
both sides ; to prevent abuses in future, and for the 
convenience of communication, I have concluded to re- 
ceive all flags, from within your lines, at the post of 
Dobbs's Ferry, and nowhere else, so long as the head- 
quai'ters of the two armies remain as at present. 

I have the honor to be, &c.* 

* This is the letter, wliich a British historian, of much repute in his 
own country, has called "stern and even savage." — Adolphus's His- 
tory of England, Vol. III. p. 446. We have already had occasion to re- 
mark, in reference to tliis writer, that prejudice, embittered feelings, and 
national antipathy are infirmities peculiarly unfortunate in a historian, 
whose high aim should be truth, candor, and justice. 

It was decided by Congress, that the Commander-in-chief should be 
directed to refuse a passport for Mr. Morgann to bring despatches to 
Philadelphia. — Journals, May lith. The advances of Sir Guy Carleton 
bore so strong a similarity to those of the commissioners in 1778, which 
proved delusive and fruitless, that Congress deemed it advisable not to 
open any door for an intercourse through this channel, and more especial- 
ly as the business of negotiating a peace was entrusted to the American 
commissioners in Europe. 

Had the tenor of Sir Guy Carleton's instructions been known in 
America, it is probable that a more conciliating temper would have been

sliown by Conffress. Tlie Into clmngo of ministry hud produced a change 
in tlie determination!) of the British cabinet, and in tJie measures for pros- 
ecuting the war, wholly unexpected and as yet not even conjectured in 
tlie United States. This will appear by the following extracts from the 
directions of llic new secretary at war to Sir Guy Carleton when he 
left England. 

" The first object of your attention must be the witlidrawing of the 
garrison, artillery, provisions, stores of all kinds, and every species of 
public property from New York and its dependencies to Halifax. The 
same steps arc to be taken with reference to tlic garrisons of Charleston 
and Savannah. The garrison of St. Augustine you will determine upon 
according to circumstances on your arrival. The execution of the whole, 
botli in point of mode and lime, is left to your discretion. In case you 
should meet with obstructions by any attack supported by a formidable 
force, or from disappointments, so that it will not be in your power to 
effect the evacuation without great hazard of considerable loss, an early 
capitulation, which may secure tlie main object, is thought preferable to 
an obstinate defence of tlie place without hope of answering any national 
purpose by it 

" In the execution of his Majesty's command you must always bear 
in recollection, that the removal and reservation of his Majesty's troops 
for his service is the immediate object, to which all other considerations 
must give way. But you must likewise lose no time to avail yourself of 
the change of measures, which has lately taken place, for the purpose of 
reconciling the minds and affections of his Majesty's American subjects, 
by such open and generous conduct, as may serve to captivate their 
hearts, and remove every suspicion of insincerity. With this view, it 
may be well worthy of your most serious consideration, whether, though 
you should not meet with the obstructions we have now too much reason 
to apprehend, it would not be best to take the part of communicating, 
immediately upon your arrival, the enclosed resolutions of the House of 
Commons, bearing as they do incontestable marks of the universal sense 
of the kingdom, and his Majesty's resolution, in consequence, of witlidraw- 
ing the troops. Vou may state every circumstance, if occasion offers, 
which has passed or is passing here, which can tend to revive old affec-

tions or extinguish late jealousies. You may observe, that the most 
liberal sentiments have taken root in the nation." — MS. Insirnclions to 
Sir Gin/ Carlefon, April Aih. 

It is obvious from these instructions, that Sir Guy Carleton had a very 
delicate and difficult task to perform, especially as in the present state of 
feeling in America it would have been impossible for him to make him- 
Belf believed for a moment, if he had communicated the sentiments of 
the British ministry. Even the cautious course, which he found it neces- 
sary to adopt, excited suspicions of liis sincerity, and an apprehension, 
that some design was at bottom, which required to be guarded against, 
as is manifest from Washington's letters and all the proceedings of Con- 
gress. No one had dreamed, that it was seriously the purpose of the 
British ministry at this time to evacuate all the maritime posts in the 
United States. The object of the ministry was a vigorous prosecution 
of the war in the West Indies against France and Spain, having already 
determined to concede the independence of the thirteen colonies. 

The real intentions of the British cabinet, however, were early pene- 
trated by Count de Vergennes. Within three weeks after the departure 
of Sir Guy Carleton from England, that minister wrote as follows to M. de 
la Luzerne. 

" Every appearance indicates, tliat the British intend withdrawing their 
forces from the United States ; or, at least, that the war will not be prose- 
cuted there any more. They are probably preparing to continue tlie war 
in the Islands against the House of Bourbon. Attempts are made for a 
separate peace. Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams will undoubtedly render an 
account of the proposals, which have been offered to them. Their lan- 
guage has been firm, and in the true principles of the alliance. In this 
respect we cannot applaud them too highly, and you may testify to Con- 
gress our entire satisfaction. If the English continue hostilities on the 
continent, it will be interesting to see in what manner the Americans will 
endeavour to render themselves useful to an ally, who has served them 
so largely. I do not expect from them much effective aid ; but I hope 
they will be sufficiently enlightened not to ascribe to the good-will of the 
new ministry that, which cannot and ought not to be considered in any 
other light, than as the effect of their weakness." — MS. Letter from 
Vergennes to I/iizerne, Versailks, May 2rf.

A variety of circumstances at this time conspire to 
prevent an ultimate decision upon the operations of 
the campaign. Before this can reach you, a total 
change of men and measures, whicli has taken place 
in Great Britain, will be announced to you. What 
will be the consequences of this revolution, cannot 
with certainty be declared. Alreaily Sir Guy Carleton 
has arrived at New York, charged, as he says, with 
a commission of peace, in conjunction with Admiral 
Digby. His terms of conciliation, which have been 
sent to me, bear the aspect of those bi'ought by for- 
mer commissioners, in the year 1780, merely ostensible 
and delusory. 

As soon as our phin of operations is fixed, which I 
hope will soon be done, you will be informed of every 
measure necessary to be communicated to you. In the 
mean time I forbear entering into any particular detail. 
General St. Clair is not arrived at my camp. I shall 
defer making any reply to your proposed regulations 
of the array till I have seen him. I am very glad to 
hear of the safe arrival of Mrs. Greene at your quarters, 
and most sincerely give you joy of the event. Mrs. 
Washington joins me in cordial compliments to JMrs. 
Greene, and hearty good wishes for her and your 
health and happiness. 

Within a few d.-iys the happy event of a birth of a

has been observed in Philadelphia, and is directed to be

TO COLONEL LEWIS NICOLA. 

Newburg, 22 May, 1782. 

Sir, 
~With a mixture of great surprise and astonishment, 
I have read with attention the sentiments you have 
submitted to my perusal. Be assured, Sir, no oc- 
currence in the course of the war has given me 
more painful sensations, than your information of there 
being such ideas existing in the army, as you have 
expressed, and I must view with abhorrence and rep- 
rehend with severity. For the present the communi- 
cation of them will rest in my own bosom, unless some 
further agitation of the matter shall make a disclosure 
necessary. 

I am much at a loss to conceive what part of my 
conduct could have given encouragement to an address, 
which to me seems big with the greatest mischiefs, 
that can befall my country. If I am not deceived in 
the knowledge of myself, you could not have found 
a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. 
At the same time, in justice to my own feelings, I must 
add, that no man possesses a more sincere wish to 
see ample justice done to the army than I do ; and, as 
far as my powers and influence, in a constitutional way, 
extend, they shall be employed to the utmost of my 
abilities to effect it, should there be any occasion. Let 
me conjure you, then, if you have any regard for your 
country, concern for yourself or posterity, or respect for

TO inilG.^^DIER-GENERAL HAZEN.

Sir, 
I have receivetl your la\or of the 27th of May, and 
am much concerned to find, that Captain Asgill has 

* The above remarkable letter is a transcript from the first draft in 
Washington's liandwriting. The foUowinij certificate is appended to it, 
and is also in the same handwriting, except the signatures, which are 
autographs of the signers. 

" The foregoing is an exact copy of a letter, which we sealed and sent 
ofif to Colonel Nicola, at tlie request of the writer of it 

"D. Hi'MriiRETs, A. D. C. 
" Jonathan Trimbui.i., Ju.'*., Secretary." 

The discontents among the officers and soldiers in the army, respecting 
the arrearages of their pay and their future prospects, had already in- 
creased to an alarming degree. Colonel Nicola, being a man of respect- 
able character, somewhat advanced in life, and also on terms of intimacy 
with the Commander-in-chief, seems to have been much consulted by the 
other officers, and made a medium for communicating verbally their 
complaints, grievances, and apprehensions. To these Washington had 
listened with his usual complaisance, with an unfeigned expression of 
feelin" for the distresses of the troops, and an unqualified declaration, 
that no effijrls on his part should be wanting to procure for them the 
justice and remuneration, which tlieir long services and sacrifices had 
merited. 

In this stage of affairs, cither of his own motion, or from the instiga- 
tion of others, Colonel Nicola addressed to the Commander-in-chief a 
paper of an extraordinary tenor, wliich drew from him the above reply. 
After some general remarks on the deplorable condition of the army, and 
the little hope they could have of being properly rewarded by Congress, 
the Colonel proceeds to a political disquisition on the different forms of 
government, and comes to the conclusion, that republics are of all others 
the least susceptible of stability, and the least capable of securing the 
rin'hts, freedom, and property of individuals. His inference is, that 
America can never prosper, or become a nation, under such a form. The 
English government he considers tlie most successful experiment, that 
has yet been tried. Then reverting somewhat in detail to the financial

been sent on, notwithstanding the information, which 
you had received, of there being two unconditional 
prisoners of war in our possession. I much fear, that 
the enemy, knowing our delicacy respecting the pro- 
priety of retaliating upon a capitulation officer in any 
case, and being acquainted that unconditional prisoners 
are within our power, will put an unfavorable construc- 
tion upon this instance of our conduct. At least, under 
present circumstances. Captain Asgill's application to 
Sir Guy Carleton will, I fear, be productive of remon- 
strance and recrimination only, which may possibly tend 
to place the subject upon a disadvantageous footing 






operations of the war, and to tlie multiplied and increasing burdens, which 
everywhere bore heavily upon the people, he added ; 

"This must have shown to all, and to military men in particular, the 
weakness of republics, and the exertions the army have been able to 
make by being under a proper head. Therefore I little doubt, that, when 
the benefits of a mixed government are pointed out, and duly con- 
sidered, such will be readily adopted. In this case it will, I believe, be 
uncontroverted, that the same abilities, which have led us through difficul- 
ties, apparently insurmountable by human power, to victory and glory, 
those qualities, that have merited and obtained the universal esteem and 
veneration of an army, would be most likely to conduct and direct us in 
the smoother paths of peace. 

" Some people have so connected the ideas of tyranny and monarchy, 
as to find it very difficult to separate them. It may therefore be requisite 
to give the head of such a constitution, as I propose, some title apparently 
more moderate ; but, if all other tilings were once adjusted, I believe 
strong arguments might be produced for admitting the title of King, 
whicli I conceive would be attended with some material advantages." 

That this hint was well understood by Washington, is evident from the 
tone of his rebuke, which is stern, direct, and severe, and such as to pre- 
clude most effectually any further advances. Nor is it to be presumed, 
that Colonel Nicola was alone in the scheme thus put forward under the 
sanction of his name. There was unquestionably at this time, and for 
some time afterwards, a party in the army, neither small in number, nor in- 
significant in character, prepared to second and sustain a measure of this 
kind, which they conceived necessary to strengthen the civil power, draw 
out the resources of the country, and establisli a durable government. 

* Prom General Hcizen's Letter. — "On the evening of the 25th instant

To remeiiy, therefore, as soon as possible this mis- 
take, you will be pleased imniodiately to order, that 
Lieutenant Turner, the olliccr you mention to be con- 
fiiiod in York gaol, or any other prisoner, who falls 
witliin iiiv description, may be conveyed to Philadel- 
phia, under the same regulations anil directions as were 
heretofore given, that he may take the place of Captain 
Asgill. In the mean time, lest any misinformation 
respecting Mr. Turner may have reached you, uhi( li 

it was ten o'clock this morning before I could assemble those gentlemen 
togrther. .M the drawing of lots, which was done in the presence of 
Major Gordon and all the British captains within Uie limits prescribed, 
the unfortunate lot has fallen on Captain Charles Asgill, of the guards, 
a young gentleman nineteen years of age ; a most amiable character ; 
Uie only son of Sir Charles Asgill : heir to an extensive fortune and an 
honorable title ; and of course he has great interest in the British court 
and army. The British officers ore highly enraged at Uie conduct of 
Sir Ilonry Clinton; they have solicited my leave to send an officer to 
New York on this occasion, or that I would intercede with the minis- 
ter of war to grant it. Being fully convinced, that no inconvenience 
could possibly arise to our cause from this indulgence, but, on the con- 
trary, that good policy and Immanity dictate the measure, 1 was pleased 
at the application, and with cheerfulness have recommended to Uie minis- 
ter of war to grant the honorable Captain Ludlow, son to the Enrl of 
Ludlow, leave to carry the representations of those unfortunate officers, 
who openly declare Uiey have been deserted by Uieir general, and given up 
to suffer for the sins of the guilty. I must here beg leave to remark, that, 
since my command at this place, as far as I have been able to discover, 
those unfortunate officers have conducted with great propriety, and, as I 
sensibly feel for their disagreeable situation, I hold it as a part of my 
duty to endeavour to alleviate their distresses by such indulgences, as 
may not be prejudicial to our ser\'ice." — Lancaster, Mny'i'th. 

Major Gordon, the principal officer among the British prisoners at Lan- 
caster, wrote to Sir Guy Carlcton as follows, after informing him of Cap- 
tain Asgill's having been selected for retaliation. 

" I have done all in my power to prevent it, which I hope will meet with 
your approbation. Lots were drawn by the captains of Lord Cornwallis's 
army present here, and when the unfortunate chance fell to Captain 
Asgill, he received it with tliat firm coolness, that would have reflected 
honor upon any officer in his Majesty's service. The delicate manner, 
in which General IFa7.cn communicated his orders to Uie British officers, 
shows him to be a man of real feeling, and the mild treatment the prison- 
ers have met with since we came to this place deser\'es the warmest ac- 
knowledgments of every British officer." — MS. Ltllir, May 2'lh.

will be detained until I can learn the certainty of Lieu-

purpose ; and, as their detention will leave the young

pleased to use every exertion in your powder to make 
the greatest despatch in the execution of this order.

TO COLONEL ELIAS DAYTON. 

Head-Quarters, 4 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I am just informed by the secretary at war, that 
Captain Asgill, of the British guards, an unfortunate 
officer, who is desdned to be the unhappy victim to 
atone for the death of Captain Huddy, had arrived in 
Philadelphia, and would set ofl' very soon for the Jer- 
sey line, the place assigned for his execution. He will 
probably arrive as soon as this will reach you, and will 
be attended by Captain Ludlow, his friend, whom he 
wishes to be permitted to go into New York, with an 
address to Sir Guy Carleton in his behalf. 

You will therefore give permission to Captain Lud- 
low to go by the way of Dobbs's Feriy into New York, 
with such representation as Captain Asgill shall please 
to make to Sir Guy Carleton. At the same time, I 
would wish you to intimate to the gentlemen, that, al- 
though I am deeply affi?cted with the unhappy fate, to 
which Captain Asgill is subjected, yet, that it will be 
to no purpose for them to make any representation to 
Sir Guy Carleton, which may serve to draw on a dis- 
cussion of the present pomt of retaUation ; that, in the

stage to wliic'li the matter has been sullered ti) run, 
all argumentation on the subject is entirely precludeil 
on my part ; that my resohitions have been grounded 
on so mature delilieration, that they must remain un- 
alterably li\ed. Vuu will also inform the gentlemen, 
that, while my duty calls me to make this decisive de- 
termination, humanity prompts a tear for the unfortu- 
nate otlering, and inilines me to say, that I most de- 
voutly wish his life may be saved. This happy event 
may be attained ; but it must be effected by the Brit- 
ish Commandfr-in-chicf. lie knows the alternative, 
which will accomplish it ; imd he knows, that this al- 
ternative only can avert the dire extremity from the 
innocent, and that in this way alone the manes of the 
murdered Captain Iluddy will be l)est appeased. 

In the mean time, while this is doing, I must beg 
that you will be pleased to treat Captain Asgill with 
every tender attention and politeness (consistent with 
his present situation), which his rank, fortune, and con- 
nexions, together with his unfortunate state, demand. 

I am, dear Sir, &,c. 



TO COLONEL ELIAS DAYTON. 

Head-Quarters, 11 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

You will inform me, a,s early as possible, of the pres- 
ent situation of Captain Asgill, the prisoner destined 
for retaliation, and what prospect he has of relief from 
his application to Sir Guy Carleton, which I have been 
informed he has made through his friend Captain Lud- 
low. I have heard nothing yet from New York in 
consequence of this application. His fate will be sus- 
pended till I can be informed of the decision of Sir

Guy Carleton ; but I am impatient, lest this should be 
unreasonably delayed. The enemy ought to have 
learned before this, that my resolutions are not to be 
trilled with. I am, &lc. 

P. S. I am informed that Captain Asgill is at Chat- 
ham Avithout guard, and under no constraint. This, if 
true, is certainly wrong. I wish to have the young 
gentleman treated with all the tenderness possible, 
consistent with his present situation ; but, until his fate 
is determined, he must be considered as a close pris- 
oner, and be kept in the greatest security. I request, 
therefore, that he be sent immediately to the Jersey 
line, where he is to be kept a close prisoner, in per- 
fect security, till further orders. 



TO ARCHIBALD CARY. 

Newburg, 15 June, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

I have been honored with your favor of the 25th 
ultimo enclosing sundry resolutions of your Assembly, 
respecting the insidious manoeuvres of the enemy, who, 
it is evident, cannot mean well, because they take indi- 
rect steps to obtain that, to which a plain road is open- 
ed, and which every good man is desirous of obtaining 
upon honorable terms. I thank you, my good Sir, for 
the resolves, which you did me the honor to enclose. 
They breathe a proper spirit, and with others of a like 
kind in the different assemblies will, it is to be hoped, 
convince the enemy, that it is both their interest and 
policy to be honest. 

It gives me much pleasure to learn from so good 
authority as your pen, that the Assembly of Virginia 



Part 11. 1 T li K A M K R I C A N R K VO L U T I O N . 307 

is better composed tliiiii it lias been for several years. 
Much, I think, may bo expected iVom it ; the path we 
are to tread is certainly a plain one ; the oI)jcct is full 
in our view, but it will not come to us ; we must work 
our way to it by proper advances, and the means of 
doing this are men and money. In vain is it to ex- 
pect, that our aim is to be accomplished by fond wishes 
for peace ; and equally unijcnorous as fruitless will it be 
for one State to depciul u\nm aiuiilicr to bring this to 
pass. If I may be allowed to speak figuratively, our 
asseml)li('s, in politics, are to be compared to the wheels 
of a clock in mechanics. The whole, for the general 
purposes of war, should be set in motion by the great 
wheel, Congress ; and, if all will do their parts, the ma- 
chine will work easily ; but a failure in one disorders 
the whole. Without the large one, which sets the 
whole in motion, nothing can be done. It is the united 
wisdom and exertions of the whole in Congress, that 
we are to depend upon. Without this we are no bet- 
ter than a rope of sand, and as easily broken asunder. 
I write thus openly and freely to you, my dear Sir, 
because I pant for retirement, and am persuaded that 
an end of our warfare is not to be obtained but by 
vigorous exertions. The subjugation of America, so far 
at least as to hold it in a dependent state, is of too 
much importance for Great Britain to yield the palm to 
us whilst her resources exist, or our inactivity, want of 
system, and dependence upon other powers prevail. I 
can truly say, that the first wish of my soul is to re- 
turn speedily into the bosom of that country, which 
gave me birth, and, in the sweet enjoyment of domestic 
happiness and the company of a few friends, to end 
my days in quiet, when I shall be called from this 
stage. With great truth and sincerity, I am, «Scc.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 17 June, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

When pressed by necessity to adopt a measure, a 
choice is scarcely left to us. In answer, therefore, to 
your letter of the 12th instant, I am obliged to observe, 
that the tardiness of the States will compel us to do 
that, which in my opinion policy forbids. 

At this critical moment, inclination w-ould not lead 
me to consent to disbanding any corps of the army. 
But if the States cannot, or, what is the same, will not 
recruit the regiments, which are assigned as their quo- 
tas, nor furnish the supplies necessaiy for their support, 
we must next consider what kind of troops under the 
present view of the matter can be dispensed with ; in 
doing which, I cannot hesitate to declare, that cavalry, 
in present circumstances and the probable operations 
of the campaign, will be least useful, and for that reason 
ought to be the first to be reduced. But how to ef- 
fect this purpose appears difficult, the corps being very 
much dispersed, and the sentiments of the officers 
quite unknown to me. I confess I am at a loss how- 
to point out any particular mode. To make it a matter 
of arrangement with the officers to determine among 
themselves who should go out, and who should remain 
in service, would be a work of time. To select the 
best from among the whole, is not only an invidious 
business, but requu-es a perfect knowledge of each in- 
dividual character, a knowledge, which, with a few ex- 
ceptions, I confess myself not possessed of. And to 
retain the corps or officers by seniority may, and I am 
sure in some instances would, give the most indifferent 
officers in the whole line of the cavalry. Not being 
able to hit on any method, which is satisfactory to my- 
self, I submit this point to your decision. 



Part II.] TlIK AMKRICAN REVOLUTION. 309 

If the regiments of artillery, allotted to the States of 
Pennsylvania ami Virginia, cannot be completed, an 
event of which I see hut little prospect, however in- 
consistent it may be with policy, and whatever conse- 
quence it may involve, I readily subscribe to the opin- 
ion of blending the two into one. Nothing surely can 
be more inconsistent with every principle of economy, 
than to keep up whole corps of officers for the sake 
of a handful of men. There cannot, I think, be a doubt 
of the propriety of reducing Hazen's regiment. The 
Canadian part of it may be formed into one or more 
companies according to their number, and be employed 
as watermen, or in other services suited to their cir- 
cumstances ; the remainder may be turned over to the 
States to which they respectively belong. 

What prospects the States south of the Delaware 
have of getting their regiments filled, under the several 
modes adopted by them, I know not ; therefore I can 
give no opinion respecting them, but am certain that no 
regiment of infantry belonging to any State north of 
the Delaware ought to be reduced. Most of the staff 
departments of the army have undergone a recent 
change. Those, I presume, cannot want a revision. 
The cjuartermaster's department has been regulated 
without any participation of mine, and I know too lit- 
tle of its present constitution to form any judgment 
upon it. The same is the state of my knowledge re- 
specting the clothier's department. I can only observe 
to you that, upon an application to me from the as- 
sistant clothier here for provisions, it appeared to me, 
thai he had more persons employed under him than 
were necessary, and on that principle I refused to give 
him an order for his full request. 

Thus, Sir, I have given you my sentiments on your 
queries. If they shall prove of any use in effecting 



310 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEt. 50. 

the salutary purposes you wish, I shall think myself 
happy in contributing in this way to the general weal. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO JOHN DICKINSON, PRESIDENT OF DELAWARE. 

Head-Q,uarters, 19 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I feel myself much obliged by the friendly commu- 
nication of your sentiments to me on the subject of 
retaliation, conveyed under your favor of the 30th of 
May, a subject truly disagreeable and distressing to me. 
The horrid circumstances of barbarity, which intro- 
duced the instance now attracting our particular atten- 
tion, came to me under the representation of so re- 
spectable a body of citizens, that they could not but 
gain my notice and interposition ; especially from a con- 
sideration, that, if it was not taken up in this line, the 
people, strongly provoked by their feelings, would pro- 
bably have assumed the matter upon their own de- 
cision, and brought it to an issue under their own 
power, which mode of proceeding, if permitted, would 
have involved circumstances still more lamentable and 
calamitous. 

In taking my resolutions, I also found myself sup- 
ported by many repeated declarations of Congress on 
this subject. And, after my resolutions were taken, I 
had the satisfaction to receive the fullest and most de- 
cided approbation of that honorable body in this par- 
ticular instance. But, under all these circumstances, 
although I never had a doubt on the general propriety 
of the measure, yet it was not my intention, could it 
be avoided, to take, as a subject of retaliation, an officer 
under sanction of capitulation or convention ; and my 



I'.uii 11.] Tin; A .M i; lU C A N KEVOLUTION. 311 

first orders were issued agreeably to that idea ; but un- 
Ibrtunatclv it was rt'ported to nic, that no ollicer of an 
unc()ntliiii)nal ilcsciiptiun was in our possession, wliich 
laid niu under a necessity of giving further orders, ex- 
ceeding my original intentions, in con^icquence of which 
the unhappy lot has fallen upon Captain Asgill, a pris- 
oner under the capitulation of Vorktown. 

I feel myself exceedingly distressed on this occa- 
sion ; but, ni}' resolutions having been taken upon the 
most mature deIil)eralion, supported by the approbation 
of Congress, and grounded on tiie general concurrence 
of all the principal olliccrs of the army, who were par- 
ticularly consulted, they cannot be receded from. Jus- 
tice to the army and the public, my own honor, and, I 
think I may venture to say, universal benevolence, re- 
quire them to be carried into full execution. It rests, 
therefore, with the British commander-in-chief to pre- 
vent this unhappy measure from taking effect. An 
application is gone to Sir Guy Carleton from Captain 
Asgill, begging his interposition to avert his fate. The 
matter is now in agitation ; and I am told that a strict 
inquiry is making into the conduct of Lippencot, who 
is charged as being the principal perpetrator of the 
cruel murder of Captain liuddy. Should this inquiry 
lead to a giving of satisfaction, by a compliance with 
my original demand to Sir Henry Clinton, my feeUngs 
will be greatly relieved, and I need not assure you, 
that I shall receive the highest pleasure from such an 
event. I am, &,c.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

nead-Q,uarters, 22 June, 1782. 

Sir, 
Your favor of the 20th of June I have had the hon- 
or to receive. Could I view your Excellency's pro- 
posal for a meeting, as intended to involve objects of 
a military nature, I should have no objection to com- 
plying with your request ; but, if its purpose embraces 
(as would seem from your letter) only points of civil 
discussion, I conceive it wholly unnecessary for me to 
accede to it* 



* By the civil tribunals of New Jersey, two men, inhabitants of that 
State, who had joined the enemy after taking the oatli of allegiance, 
and then were captured, had been condemned as guilty of treason. Sir 
Guy Carleton thought the proceeding very extraordinary, and a " meas- 
ure of the most fatal extremity." On this subject he requested a pass- 
port for General Robertson to go out and hold an interview with Gen- 
eral Washington, or with some person whom he miglit appoint for the 
purpose. See his letter of June 20th, in the Appe.ndix, No. IX. 

The British general continued to use his endeavours to produce a con- 
ciliatory feeling in the people of the United States, and to open the 
way for a separate peace. On tliis subject M. de la Luzerne wrote as 
follows. 

" Sir Guy Carleton attempted to commence a correspondence with 
Congress, but that assembly wholly declined his advances. He then 
wrote to some of the governors of the States, but their answers were 
equally pointed and repulsive. He next addressed himself to the people, 
not directly, but through the channel of the newspapers in New York ; 
exhorting them to change their leaders and recall their present members 
of Congress, and speaking of the new disposition for reconciliation and 
peace on tlie part of the mother country ; but all without effect. Another 
attempt is to humiliate Congress by representing them to be under the 
influence of France, and particularly of the French minister in the United 
States. But he has used another instrument more powerful than these. 
He treats all the Americans, who fall into his hands, witli extreme kind- 
ness ; e.xhorts them not to bear arms against Great Britain ; admits freely 
into New York the wives of the captains of vessels, which have been 
taken and brought into that harbour, and at their solicitation releases 
their husbands. And he has even written to General Washington, that 
he will send back the captured Carolinians in the King's ships and at the 
King's expense ; and that he would do all in his power to cause them to

As I hiiil ihc Imnni- in my last* of transmitting the 
circunist;incos relating to llatfR-kl and Hadgcly, and of 
informing you, that, finding them entirely in the hands 
of the civil power, it was not within my line to say 
any thing further on the subject; so, from the tenor 
of your letter, it becomes necessary for me now to be 
very explicit in mentioning to your Excellency, that, 
in matters of civil resort, I am not authorized, in any 
case, to make the least interference. The civil laws, 
within the several States, having been passed without 
any agency of mine, I am equally excluded from any 
part in their execution; neither is it to be supposed, 
that they are under any control or influence from me. 
The civil power, therefore, of the States only being 
competent to the discussion of civil points, I shall 
leave them wholly to their consideration, being deter- 
mined to confine myself to the proper line of my du- 
ty, which is purely mihtary. 

Previously, tlierefore, to closing with your proposal, 
I have to recjuest, that your Excellency will be pleased 
to declare, whether it was your intention that the gen- 
tlemen, whom you wished to meet together, should be 
convened in a military ca[iacity only, and be confined 
solely to the discussion of military points. If so, I shall 
immediately on receipt of your answer nominate one 
or more gentlemen, who shall be authorized to attend 
such persons as may be appointed on your part, at 
Dobbs's Ferry, and shall feel myself very happy, if, by 
a discussion of any military points, which may then be 
proposed, any measures can be adopted for humanizing, 

forget their past injuries." — MS. Letter from Luzerne to Vergenncs,

TO COUNT DE KOCHAMBEAU. 

Newburg, 24 June, 1782. 

My dear Count, 
I have looked with anxious impatience ibr those de- 
spatches from your court, the arrival of which to you was 
to be the basis of our interview at Philadelphia. I have 
been in such daily expectation of this event, that I have 
not ventured more than fifteen miles from this place, 
lest your summons should arrive here in my absence. 

The season for operating in this quarter is flying 
away rapidly ; and I am more and more embarrassed 
in determining on the measures, which are proper to be 
pursued. If the aids, which are designed for us by 
your generous nation, are sufiiciently powerful, and ar- 
rive in season to warrant the enterprise against New 
York, not a moment should be lost in commencing 
your march this way. On the other hand, if the naval 
superiority, destined by his Most Christian Majesty for 
this coast, should be late in coming, or if, when it does 
arrive, our force should be judged inadequate to the 
siege of New York, and our arms are to be turned 
against Charleston, as the next object of importance, 
every step, which the French army under your Excel- 
lency's command might make this way, would not only 
serve to fatigue them, but the baggage, teams, and ar- 
tillery horses, which are provided for the service of the 
campaign, would, by such a movement, be rendered 
unfit to perform a march to South Carolina, and every 
other expense incident to this manoeuvre would be 
needlessly increased.

by tiic late events in tiie West Indies, I lind myseH' at

that we mi^^ht, by a live intercourse of sentiments upon

you approve of such a meeting before you receive your

TO BARON STEUBEN. 

Head-Quarters, 9 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

In answer to your letter of yesterday's date, con- 
taining the following queries, 

"Is the department of inspector-general necessary 
in the army, or is it not ? Has this department been 
conducted during the course of five years agreeably 
to your wishes ; and have the consequences resulting 
from my exertions as chief of the department answered 
your expectation ? " 

I give it as my clear opinion, that it has been of the 



316 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Er.50. 

Utmost Utility, and continues to be of the greatest im- 
portance, I'or reasons too plain and obvious to need 
enumeration ; but more especially tor having establish- 
ed one uniform system ot" mancEuvres and regulations 
in an army, composed of the troops of thirteen States 
(each having its local prejudices), and subject to con- 
stant interruptions and deviations from the frequent 
changes and dissolutions it has undergone. 

It is equally just to declare, that the department, 
under your auspices, has been conducted with an in- 
telligence, activity, and zeal, not less beneficial to the 
public than honorary to yourself, and that I have had 
abundant reason to be satisfied with your abilities and 
attention to the duties of your office, during the four 
years you have been in the service. I am, &c. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 9 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

Having found a moment's leisure to examine, myself, 
into the situation of aflairs on the frontiers of this State, 
I have lately made a journey up the Hudson and Mo- 
hawk Rivers as far as Saratoga and Schenectady. Just 
before my arrival there, a party of three or four hun- 
dred of the enemy, consisting of British, refugees, and 
savages, had made an incursion down the Mohawk, 
attacked, and captured (after a gallant defence) a small 
guard of Continental troops, who were stationed at the 
only remaining mill in the upper setdements, which 
they also destroyed. 

By a deserter from this party we are informed, that 
the enemy are taking post at Oswego, and are either 
rebuilding the old, or erecting new fortifications there. 



Part 11.] THK A M K K I f A N K H V OH! TI O N . •"H? 

Whatever tlie design of the enemy may be by thus 
CK-cuijyiriii; a new post, and extending themselves on the 
frontier, I consider it my tUuy to inform Congress there- 
of, and have for that purpose taken the liberty to for- 
ward this liy tiie earliest safe conveyance since my 
return from the northward. 

I lia\ e the honor to enclose to your Excellency cop- 
ies and extracts of sundry letters, which have lately 
passed between the British commander-in-chief and 
myself. The subjects contained in them being princi- 
pally of a civil nature, I must beg leave to submit them 
to the consideration and direction of Congress. I think 
it only necessaiy to remark, that, notwithstanding the 
plausibility of the terms on which Sir Guy Carleton 
proposes the exchange of American seamen for British 
soldiers, in his letter of the 7th instant, it must still be 
obvious, that it would amount to nearly the same thing 
to have the prisoners so exchanged employed against 
our allies in the West Indies, as it would to have them 
acting against ourselves on the continent. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.*

My dear Sir,

under your command, have been duly received ; but, 
having been in momentary expectation, that intelligence

would arrive from Europe, or some other event turn 
up, which might disclose the intentions of the enemy, 
and give a clue for the final determination of the ope- 
rations of the campaign, I have delayed for a few days 
giving you my answer. Notwithstanding I am at this 
hour as much in the dark as ever, I can defer no longer 
the pleasure I always experience from indulging my- 
self in a free communication and interchange of senti- 
ments with you. To participate and divide our feelings, 
hopes, fears, and expectations with a friend, is almost 
the only source of pleasure and consolation left us, in 
the present languid and unpromising state of our atiairs. 

It gives me infinite satisfaction to find, that, by your 
prudence and decision, you have put a period to the 
progress of a dangerous mutiny, and, by your example 
of patience and firmness, reclaimed the army amidst all 
their aggravated sufferings to that good disposition, 
which it has been your great merit to preserve in your 
command through the worst of times. Their distress- 
es are truly deplorable; and, while the almost insur- 
mountable difliculty of transporting clothing and the 
smaller supplies (which, General St. Clair reports, are 
still detained on the road for want of the means of con- 
veyance) gives me the most sensible pain and anxiety, 
it but too clearly proves the impracticability of removing 
by land, under our present prospects of finance, the 
siege artillery and immense quantity of stores neces- 
sary for a serious operation against Charleston. 

The disastrous event of the naval action in the West 
Indies may, indeed, and probably will now give a total 
alteration to the complexion of the campaign. This 
will, in all human probability, operate more than any 
other circumstance against the evacuation of the soudi- 
ern States ; for what would have before been a very 
hazardous fine of conduct, and would have exposed 



I'AiiT 11] Tin; AMKRirA.N RKVOLUTION. ^19 

the enemy to a fatal blow in case of a naval coiiperation 
on this coast, may now be considered as a rational and 
prudent measure on their part. But the mode of de- 
fensive war (which the enemy alfect to have adopted, 
in which 1 would however place but very little confi- 
dence), and especially the detachment from Charleston, 
which must have weakened them considerably, will, I 
hope, enable you at all events to hold your own ground 
until the southern and middle States shall have made 
some eflbrts for your reinforcement, and initil the pe- 
cuniary affairs of the continent in general shall be put 
in a better situation. Some little, I flatter myself, will be 
done, although I must confess my expectations tor the 
campaign are not very sanguine. I feel with you, my 
dear friend, all the regret and mortification, that can 
possibly be conceived, li-om a consideration that we 
shall be able to avail ourselves so imperfectly of the 
weakness and embarrassments of our enemv ; while, on 
the other hand, I think there is reason to apprehend 
from some late indications the enemy have given, by 
taking post at Oswego and extending themselves on 
the frontier, that they mean, availing themselves of our 
languor and looking forwartl to the hour of pacification, 
to occupy as much territory as they are able to do, 
before a negotiation shall be entered upon. I wish we 
may be in a capacity to counteract their designs. 

I have given my opinion to Congress through the 
secretary at war, that it will be advisable to make a 
permanent incorporation of all the troops southward 
of the Delaware in the manner you propose ; but, as 
the observations did not apply to the other troops, 
these regiments ought to remain on their present es- 
tablishment. 

As to the movement and tlisposition of the French 
ai-my, I will tell you exactly my idea and plan respect- 



320 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [ JEt. 50. 



ing it, and how the matter now rests. While we con- 
tinued in the state of uncertainty, which has so long 
perplexed and prevented us from forming any projects 
whatever, I wished to have the corps of the Count de 
Rochambeau remain in a situation equally capable of 
looking either way, as circumstances might eventually 
require, being well persuaded in my own mind, that 
with their assistance (without the aid of a naval force) 
we should not at this time be able to do any thing 
effectual against New York, defended by its present 
garrison ; and, presuming still greater difficulties would 
oppose themselves to an attempt against Charleston, I 
proposed to postpone my final resolution until we should 
hear from the other side of the Atlantic. For, allowing 
your army, in conjunction with the French troops, to 
be completely competent to the object, the transporta- 
tion by land of heavy artillery stores and apparatus ap- 
peared to me an inevitable obstacle, which I have fuUy 
explained in my letter of the 23d of April last. Be- 
sides, the diminution of an army in so long a march, 
and the innumerable advantages the enemy must de- 
rive from the command of the water, were considera- 
tions with me. And, as I flattered myself we might be 
able to keep the enemy in check with our present 
force, both in the northern and southern departments, 
I therefore thought it expedient, that the select corps 
of our allies in Virginia should continue unimpaired as 
a corps de reserve in that State, until new informa- 
tion or circumstances should produce new orders from 
me ; unless the Count de Rochambeau should first be 
apprized of some contingence or event, which should 
render a movement in his opinion proper; in which 
case the matter was left to his determination. I 
have this moment learned from his Excellency, the 
Minister of France, that the Count has already com- 



Part II.] Till': AMKRICAN RKVOLUTION. 321 

menced his march northward. What circumstances 
have led to this, I am uiia!)le to say ; but expect to 
see the Count liimsch' in a lew ilays (by appointment) 
at Philadelphia, where it is jM-oposcd to enter into a 
discussion ol" the possible objects and views of the 
cainpais^n, so far as our i^eneral and imperfect know- 
ledge of allairs will admit, ami from whence I shall have 
the pleasure to inform you of any thing of moment, 
that niav in itu- mean time take place, or ultimately be 
in contem[)lation. 

Under an idea, that the French troops would cer- 
tainly be withdrawn from Virginia at some moment of 
the campaign, and perhaps unexpectedly, I have long 
since written to Governor Harrison on that subject, 
imd requested that a body of men might be in readi- 
ness for the defence of the State on that occasion. In- 
deed I have written almost incessantly to all the States, 
urging, in the most forcible terms I could make use 
of, the absolute necessity of complying with the requi- 
sitions of Congress in furnishing their contingents of 
men and money, and am vinhappy to say the success 
of these applications has not been equal to my ex- 
pectation. 

I am happy to assure you there was no foundation 
for the report of my having had a narrow escape in 
passing the Clove. In return, we have had a similar 
account respecting yourself, which I hope was equally 
groundless. Believe me, my dear Sir, I shall always 
consider myself deeply interested in whatever con- 
cerns you, and shall ever rejoice at your health, safety, 
and felicity. 

Mrs. Washington, who is just setting out for Vir- 
ginia, joins me in most affectionate regards to Mrs. 
Greene and yourself. I am, dear Sir, with the most 
perfect esteem, &,c.

P. S. Although the campaign does not promise 
much activity, yet I shall wish you to keep me as 
regularly and accurately informed of the state of your 
department as possible, noting the strength, movements, 
and position of your own army, and that of the ene- 
my. It may also be essential for me to be made ac- 
quainted with the resources of the country and every 
thing of a military or political nature, which may be 
interesdng to our future plans and operations.* 



TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Head-Quarters, 10 July, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 
The last post brought me your letter of the 19th of 
May. I must confess, that I am not at all astonished 

* According to the proposal of Count de Rochambeau, a conference 
was held at Philadelphia respecting tlie future operations of the cam- 
paign. The two commanders met there on the 15th of July. As no in- 
structions had been received from the French court, it was not in the 
power of Count de Rochambeau to give any decided information as to 
the time a French fleet might be expected on the coast from the West 
Indies, or its strength when arrived. He had reason to suppose, however, 
that it would come to the northward ; and, as the sickly season was ap- 
proaching in Virginia, he had put his troops under marching orders about 
the 1st of July, and expected they would reach Baltimore before the end 
of the month. It was agreed, therefore, that the French army should re- 
main a few days at Baltimore, till further instructions or intelligence 
should be received, and that, unless special reasons might appear to the 
contrary, the army should continue its march northwardly, and join the 
American forces on the Hudson. This plan was thought advisable, 
moreover, to prevent Sir Guy Carleton from sending detachments from 
New York to Jamaica, where they might be turned against the French 
in the West Indies. 

An elaborate memoir, pointing out various plans of a campaign, was 
presented by General Washington to Count de Rochambeau, who for- 
warded it to the French court. Immediately after the interview Gen- 
eral Washington returned to Newburg, where he arrived on the 27th of 
July. 



PahtII] tiik amkric an r evolution. 323 

at the failure of your plun. That spirit of fieedoin, 
which at tlie commencement of this contest would 
have gladly sacriliced every thing to the attainment 
of its object, has long since subsided, and every self- 
ish passion has taken its place. It is nut the public, 
but private interest, which inlluences tiie generality of 
mankind, nor can the Americans any longer boast an 
exception. Under these circumstances, it would rather 
have been surprising if you had succeeded, nor will 
you I fear have better success in Georgia.* 

At the present moment, there is very little prospect 
of the campaign being much more active in this quar- 
ter tlian in yours. However, little can be positively 
determined, till we have some advices from Europe, 
which I am anxiously waiting for. When they arrive, 
I shall be better able to tell you what we may ex- 
pect. Sir Guy Carleton is using every art to soothe 
and lull our people into a state of security. Admiral 
Digby is capturing all our vessels, and suflbcating as 
fast as possible in prison-ships all our seamen, who 
will not enlist into the service of his Britannic Majes- 
ty ; and Hiddimand, with his savage allies, is scalping 
and burning on the frontiers. Such is the line of con- 
duct pursued by the dilferent commanders, and such 
their politics. You have my best wishes, being al- 
ways sincerely yours. 

• The plan here mentioned, which Colonel Laurens was extremely 
anxious to carry into effect, was to raise a regiment of black levies in 
South Carolina. lie brought the subject before the legislature of the 
State, and pursued it with all his zeal and influence, but the measure 
was not approved. " It was some consolation, however," said he, " to 
perceive tliat truth and philosophy had gained some ground, the suf- 
frages in favor of the measure being twice as numerous as on a for- 
mer occasion. Some hopes have been lately given me from Georgia ; 
but I fear, when the question is put, we shall be outvoted there with as 
much disparity as we have been in tliis country." — Bacon^s Bridge, 
South Carolina, May 19th.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 30 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

In reply to your letter of the 2.5th, I have to in- 
form your Excellency, that Major-General Heath, sec- 
ond in command, with two aids-de-camp, will have the 
honor of meeting an officer of equal rank, of your ap- 
pointment, at the house of Mr. Phillips, on the .5th 
day of August next. At that time, General Heath 
will receive from your officer the proceedings of the 
court-martial on Captain Lippencot for the murder of 
Captain Huddy, together with such other documents 
as you shall think proper to communicate. The as- 
surance, which your Excellency has given me of the 
fullest satisfaction in this matter, is as pleasing as it 
is interesting.* 

Your Excellency's propositions, contained in your 
letter of the 7th, have been communicated to Con- 
gress, and are now under the consideration of that 
honorable body. As soon as I am favored with their 
determination, you may be assured I will do myself 
the honor to communicate it to you. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

* The proposal to send a person to meet General Heath was declined 
by Sir Guy Carleton, on the ground that it was not expedient for an offi- 
cer of his rank to come out merely to take papers, which he said he would 
forward by the usual conveyance of a flag. It was the request of Sir 
Guy, that a passport might be forwarded for Chief Justice Smith to go 
out with the papers, and make additional explanations. " I had further 
an intention," said he, " of desiring the like passports for Mr. Attorney- 
General Kempe, who I wished should accompany him, not only to this 
end, but for that of entering also into such explanations, as might tend to 
remove all reciprocal complaints in the province of New Jersey." This 
matter having no relation to the military department. General Wasliing- 
ton refused to be in any manner concerned in it.

Sir, 
In pursuance of an act of Congress, directing me 
"to romanil imiiu-iiiatL'ly Lieuteniint-General Earl Corn- 
wallis to the United States, unless tiie Honorable llenry 
Laurens be forthwith released from his captivity, and 
furnished with passports to any part of Europe or 
America, at his option, or be admitted to a general 
parole," 1 have to request your Excellency, that or- 
ders for this purpose may be communicated to Lieu- 
tenant-General Earl Cornwallis by the first convey- 
ance, informing him, that, as this order is strictly con- 
formable to the tenor of his parole, I have the fullest 
expectation of his immediate return to the United 
States, unless the conditions mentioned in the act of 
Congress are speedily complied with. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.* 

* In reply to the above, after mentioninsr tliat he ha<l just received ad- 
vices from England, which would shortly be the subject of an important 
joint despatch from Admiral Digby and himself, Sir Guy Carleton said ; 
" I may venture so far to anticipate, as to acquaint yon, that Mr. Laurens 
has been for some time in perfect freedom, and has declared, that he con- 
siders Lord Cornwallis as exchanged ; but I shall wish, in consequence 
of the communications to be made, to receive also your sentiments or 
those of Congress on so delicate a point." — August \st. 

Sir Guy Carleton had recently written to the ministry, that ho had hitli- 
crto declined evacuating New York, for the want of victuallers and trans- 
ports, and also on account of the difficulty of maintaining a defensive 
pcsition while weakening his forces. Mr. Townshend, the secretary at 
war, wrote to him, tliat transports would be immediately supplied from 
Quebec, that Admiral Pigot was ordered to take from New York to the 
West Indies a part of the troops, and that the remainder were to be em- 
barked for IIalifa.\. 

" His Majesty," said Mr. Townshend, " having more maturely consid- 
ered the importance of the service in the West Indies, is determined that

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 6 August, 1782. 

My DEAR Sir, 

In my last letter, I mentioned my expectation of 
soon meeting the Count de Rochambeau in Philadel- 
phia, and my intention of writing to you from that 
place, in case any thing of moment should turn up in 
the mean while ; but as our hopes, that public de- 
spatches would have arrived from France before our 
meeting, have been disappointed, I can only inform you, 
that matters now rest in the same situation as described 
in my former letters, except with regard to the nego- 
tiations, which are said to be carrying on by the bel- 
ligerent powers in Europe. 

Indeed, I hardly know what to think or believe of 
the disposition of the court of Britain. Certain it is, 
the new administration have made overtures of peace 
to the several nations at war, apparently with a design 
to detach some one or other of them from the 2;en- 
eral combination ; but, not having succeeded in their 
efforts for a separate negodation, how far the necessity 
of affairs may carry them in their wishes for a general 
pacification upon admissible terms, I cannot undertake 
to determine. From the former infatuation, duplicity, 
and perverse system of British policy, I confess I am 
induced to doubt every thing, to suspect every thing ; 
otherwise I should suppose, from the subsequent ex- 
tract of a letter from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral 
Digby to me, dated the 2d instant, that the prospects 
of, and negotiation for, a general peace would be very 
favorable. 

take upon you the command of his forces in the West Indies." — MS. 
Letter, .'higust iith. 

The speedy return of peace prevented the execution of this order, as 
well as that for the removal of the troops.

" We arc acqiKiinled, Sir, by autliority, that negotia- 
tions for a general peace have already comniencetl at 
Paris, and tiiat Mr. (Jrenville is invested witli full pow- 
ers to treat witii all parties at war, and is now at Paris 
in the execution of his commission. And we are like- 
wise. Sir, further made accjuainted, that his Majesty, 
in order to remove all obstacles to that peace, which 
he so ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his 
ministers to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independency 
of the thirteen provinces should be proposed by him, 
in the first instimce, instead of making it a condition 
of a general treaty ; however, not without the highest 
confidence, that the loyalists shall be restored to their 
possessions, or a full compensation made them for what- 
ever confiscations may liave taken place." 

These communications, they say, had just arrived by 
a packet. They farther add, that iVIr. Laurens was 
enlarged from all engagements, and that transports were 
prepared for conveying all American prisoners to this 
country to be exchanged here. Whatever the real in- 
tention of the enemy may be, I think the strictest at- 
tention and exertion, which have ever been practised 
on our part, instead of being diminished, ought to be 
increased thereby. Jealousy and precaution, at least, 
can do no harm. Too much confidence and supine- 
ncss may be pernicious in the extreme. 

There having been a vague report, that a small em- 
barkation of cavalry and inlantry was to take place at 
New York, to relieve part of the garrison of Charles- 
ton, I have made use of this occasion to desire the 
secretary at war to put Armand's legion immediately 
in motion to join you, and have requested he will use 
his endeavours to have the means afforded to facili- 
tate and expedite the movement. 

A mail has lately been intercepted by the enemy 



328 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

between Philadelphia and Trenton, in which, I am in- 
formed, there were letters from you to me. These 
were probably of the same date as your despatches to 
Congress, wherein the correspondence between Gen- 
eral Leslie and yourself was enclosed. I mention this 
circumstance, that you may forward duplicates in case 
you should judge it necessary. 

You will, I imagine, have heard, before this reaches 
you, of the arrival of M. Vaudreuil with a fleet of thir- 
teen ships of the line on this coast. I can give you no 
particulars, as I have no official account of his arrival. 
The army of the Count de Rochambeau, having, as I 
advised you in my last, marched towards the north- 
ward, it was concluded at our meeting in Philadelphia, 
upon a consideration of all circumstances, that this 
corps should proceed to join the army on the Hud- 
son. They were at Baltimore by the last intelligence 
from that quarter. 

Since the receipt of the letter from the commission- 
ers. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby, I have seen 
a New York paper of the 3d instant, in which is a 
speech of General Conway, and some other articles, 
which appear to be designed to propose independence 
to America on certain conditions not admissible, name- 
ly, that the legislature of America should be totally 
independent of the Parliament of Great Britain, but 
that the King of England should have the same kind 
of supremacy here as in Ireland. I have not informa- 
tion sufficient to determine, whether this is the kind 
of independence alluded to in the letter of the com- 
missioners, or not. I hope my suspicions, however, 
may be ill-founded. Wishing you all the success and 
happiness you can desire, I am, my dear Sir, with the 
highest sentiments of regard and esteem, &.c. 



PaktII.1 the AMERICAN revolution. 329 



TO GOVKUNOR HANCOCK. 

Ilead-Quartcrs, 10 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency will ho informed by Brigadier- 
General Choisy, who does me the honor to be the 
bearer of this, that the INIarquis de Vaudreuil, with a 
fleet of his Most Christian Majesty's ships of war, may 
be soon expected in the harbour of Boston. 

By a correspondence, which has passed between the 
Marquis and the Count de Rochambeau, a copy of 
which I have been favored with by the latter, I am 
informed that the French admiral has it in contempla- 
tion to strike a coup de main upon the post of Penob- 
scot, while his ships are to continue in your neighbour- 
hood, requesting the opinion and advice of the Count 
upon the practicability of the enterprise. It appears 
also from the same communication, that the French 
general has given him a partial, yet pretty plain disap- 
probation of the attempt, and has referred him to my 
opinion on the subject, which the Count de Rocham- 
beau in his letter to me particularly requests tne to 
communicate to the Marquis on his arrival. 

However desirable the object may be, to dispossess 
the enemy from that troublesome post, yet under pres- 
ent circumstances and prospects I have not judged the 
attempt to be advisable, and have therefore given the 
French admiral my opinion decidedly against it. My 
particular sentiments on the subject will be conveyed 
to you in the copy of my letter to the Marquis, which 
I do myself the honor to enclose to your Excellency 
for yoiu- own observation, and that of the executive 
of your State. 

If, notwithstanding my sentiments and present ap- 
pearances, other more favorable circumstances should

turn up, or prospects should so alter as to make the 
attempt appear practicable in the judgment of the 
French admiral and General de Choisy, as also in the 
opinion of your executive, I have no doubt that your 
State will afford every assistance, in the most expedi- 
tious manner, in men, cannon, mortars, and military 
stores, that may be found necessary to carry the ope- 
ration into effect. The distance of the army from 
Boston, with other circumstances, will render it im- 
possible to give any timely aid from this quarter. 

I am, dear Sir, &c.* 



TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Newburg, 11 August, 1782. 

Sir, 
Having been informed that Major-General Gates is 
in Philadelphia, and being now about to make my ul- 
timate arrangements for the campaign, I take the lib- 
erty to request, that you will be pleased to inform me by 
the earliest conveyance whether he wishes to be em- 
ployed in this army or not. As it is now in my power 
to give General Gates a command suitable to his rank, 
and as I have not heard from him since I wrote to 
him on the 18th of March last, I trouble you with this 
request, that I may be stOl made acquainted with his 
determination before the disposition of commands is 
finally concluded. I have the honor to be, &c.t 

* The project was abandoned, although the executive of Massachu- 
setts made some efforts to have it put in execution. The Marquis de 
Vaudreuil anchored his fleet in Nantasket Road on the 10th of August.

Sir, 
Were we certain, that a pacification had advanced so 
far as your ExcelliMu y thinks it has, or could we he 
assured tiiat the British ministry were really sincere in 
their offers, whicii have been communicated through 
their Commander-in-chiel", Sir Guy Carleton, I should 
think you might, without any inconvenience or danger, 
await the orders ol" your court where you now are,* 
and dismiss all your wagons. But when we consider, 
that negotiations are sometimes set on foot merely to 
gain time, that there are yet no offers on the part of 
the enemy for a general cessation of hostihties, and that, 
although their commanders in this country are in a 
manner tied down by the resolves of their House of 
Commons to a defensive war only, yet they may be at 
liberty to transport part of their force to the West In- 
dies, I think it highly necessary, for the good of the 

eral Lincoln has acquainted me, that it is your Excellency's desire to 
know, if I wish to take command in the army this campaign. I beg your 
Excellency to believe, that I am always ready to obey your commands, 
and shall be most happy when I can execute them to your satisfaction. 
I have but to entreat, that no attention to me or my rank may interfere 
or break in upon any part of your arrangements. My zeal for the public 
interest makes me exceedingly anxious to be present at the great con- 
cluding stroke of this war." — .VS. Ltltcr, Philadelphia, Augusl Mth. 

Since the unfortunate battle of Camden, General Gates had been in 
retirement at his seat in Virginia. The court of inquiry, ordered by 
Congress to examine into that matter, had never been convened. The 
subject was at length brought forward anew, and it was resolved, " That 
the resolution of the 5th of October, 1780, directing a court of inquiry on 
the conduct of Major-Gcneral Gates be repealed ; and that he take com- 
mand in the army as llie Commander-in-chief shall direct." — Journals, 
August 14/A. This resolution passed with only three dissenting voices. 
He rejoined the army on the 5tli of October, and took command of the

common cause, and especially to prevent the measure, 
which I have last mentioned, to unite our force upon 
the North River ; and in this opinion I am confirmed by 
the sentiments contained in a letter trom the minister 
of France to the Marquis de Vaudreuil, which he has 
been good enough to leave open for my inspection. 

" From the different accounts I can collect," says he, 
"it seems to be the design of England to make a gen- 
eral peace ; but the demands on one side and the other 
will render a conclusion extremely difficult ; and in such 
a case that power will spare nothing to effectuate a 
peace with the United States, and turn all their efforts 
against us. As to a separate peace with the United 
States it will not take place. I am certain they will 
not make peace but in concert with us." The minis- 
ter also says to me; "You will judge better than I 
can, whether it is proper to march the French army 
or not. It is certain, that it will be necessary, if the 
English show any disposition to detach a considerable 
force to the West Indies." What are the intentions of 
the enemy in this respect, it is impossible for me pre- 
cisely to determine. Accounts from New York, but 
not on very good authority, still continue to mention an 
embarkation for the West Indies. The garrison of Sa- 
vannah has arrived at New York, and there are some 
grounds for believing that Charleston will be evacuated. 
Should that event take place, and the garrison also 
come to New York, they might without danger detach 
considerably, should our force continue divided. 

Upon the whole. Sir, I hardly imagine you will think 
it prudent to dismiss your carriages under present ap- 
pearances and circumstances ; and, if you do not, the 
cattle will be as easily and cheaply subsisted upon a 
march as in a settled camp. Should an accommoda- 
tion take place, and should the orders of your court

call you iVoiu the cotitincat, your cmbarUation might be 
as easily iiuule upon (he Delaware or the Hudson, as 
upon the Chesapeake. I am of opinion, therefore, that 
no <roocl consequences can result from your remaining 
at Baltimore, but that many advantages may attend 
your marching forward, and forming a junction with this 
army. Actuated by no motives, but those which tend 
to the general good, I have taken the liberty of giving 
my sentiments with that freedom, wiili which 1 am 
convinced you would ever wish me to deliver them. 
I beg leave to return my thanks for the attention you 
have paid to the exchange, not only of Colonel Lau- 
moy, but of several others of our officers.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 18 August, 1782. 

^Iv DEAR Sir, 
I have had the pleasure of receiving your private 
letter of the 12th instant. I cannot but think the con- 
duct respecting the release of Lord Cornwallis very 
extraordinary. Is it reasonable that Mr. Laurens should 
be at full liberty, and acting as a commissioner in Eu- 
rope, while Lord Cornwallis, for whose liberation he 
pledged his own honor, and consequently as a public 
man that of the States, is held bound by his parole ? 
Either disavow the propriety of Mr. Laurens's conduct, 
and let him be remanded by the British ministry, or 
set Lord Cornwallis at equal liberty. I am placed in a 
very delicate situation. Sir Guy Carleton has given me 
official information of the ti-ansaction, and has called for 
a confirmation of Rlr. Laurens's act. I have referred 
the matter to the proper place, and I can obtain no

answer. In my letters to General Carleton I am obliged 
to be for the present silent, but I certainly must expect 
to hear from him again. Do, my good Sir, endeavour 
to obtain a decision upon this matter.* 

Your public letter of the 12th covers a resolve of the 
same date, authorizing me to propose a meeting of com- 
missioners for establishing a cartel. Here again I am 
somewhat embarrassed, never having yet received eith- 
er the approbation or disapprobation of Congress upon 
the proceedings of the former commissioners, General 
Knox and Mr. Gouverneur Morris, although they were 
transmitted so long ago as the 30th of April last. It 
appears by the report of those gentlemen, that the ne- 
gotiation was broken off principally on account of the 
disposition, which plainly appeared on the part of the 
British commissioners to procure the exchange of their 
soldiers in our hands without settlement of accounts, or 



* The letter from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby to General 
Washington was referred by Congress to a committee, who, on the part 
relating to Mr. Laurens, " proposed and reported, that the General should 
be directed to empower his commissioners [for negotiating a cartel] to re- 
lease Earl Cornwallis from his parole in return for the indulgence granted 
to Mr. Laurens ; but Mr. Rutledge, one of the committee, inveighed 
against this with so much warmth and indignation, that it was rejected 
with a loud and general JVo from all parts of the House. Nothing was 
said on the proposition of exchanging soldiers for seamen. Congress 
deemed it inexpedient to touch upon that matter at present, or to do any 
thing that might serve as a pretext for refusing to settle a cartel ; and ap- 
preliended, if a general cartel was established, provision might be made 
therein for a release of our seamen, as well as for preventing the capture 
of unarmed chhens." — Charles Thomson's MS. Sketch of the Debate in 
Confess, Jlvgust 12th. For a view of the policy and objects of the dif- 
ferent States at this time, growing chiefly out of local considerations, see 
a paper by Mr. Madison in the Appendix, No. X. 

At the solicitation of Mr. Laurens after he was set at liberty, and after 
the return of Lord Cornwallis to England, Dr. Franklin sent to the latter 
a paper discharging him from his parole, but reserving to Congress the 
approbation or disallowance of the act. In consequence of this form of 
release, Lord Cornwallis considered himself at liberty, and took his seat 
in the House of Peers. — Diplomatic Corr&sponrfence, Vol. III. pp. 362, 373.

making any payment, or giving any security for tlie 
payment, of the large sum wliicli, we conceive, is due. 
Now Congress, in the resolve to which 1 have just re- 
ferrcil, make no reference to any former transaction, but 
authorize me to settle a cartel, "taking care that the 
iiciuidation of accounts and settlement of the balance 
due for the maintenance of prisoners be provided for 
therein." From this it may possibly be inferred, that 
tin y do approve the former proceedings, and mean to 
make the settlement of accounts a preliminary ; but this 
is an inference only, and may be a Adse one ; and 
tlierelbre I wisii you to endeavour to find out the true 
meaning of the House, and to procure a determination 
upon the former proceedings. 

The same commissioners will probably be appointed 
upon our part, and, could they be assured their former 
principles were thought good, they would proceed with 
more confidence upon a future occasion. I confess to 
you, that I have found so many diniculties thrown in 
the way of all former transactions of this nature, that I 
could ever wish Congress to be as full and explicit as 
possible, as to the points which they would have either 
conceded or demanded. I would prefer that mode on 
many accounts to unlimited powers, as you may easily 
conceive. But what I princip;xlly now want to be as- 
sured of is, whether they do or do not approve the 
conduct of the former commissioners, and the principles 
which they seemed desirous of establishing. With 
much truth and affection, I am, &.C.* 

• The subject of this letter was laid before Confrress by the secretary 
at war, and was referred to a committee, who made a long report on the 
general principles to be followed in arranging a cartel. After consider- 
able debate, the report was adopted, and the proceedings of the commis- 
sioners were approved. — Joumais, September 9lh. 



336 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 50. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 19 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

Congress have been already furnished with copies of 
all letters, which had passed between the commanders- 
in-chief of the British forces in New York and myself, 
respecting the murder of Captain Huddy previous to 
the last of July. I have now the honor to enclose Sir 
Guy Carleton's letter of the 1st instant, in reply to 
mine of the 30th ultimo, and that of the 13th, which 
accompanied the proceedings of the general court- 
martial for the trial of Captain Lippencot. The pro- 
ceedings, together with such other documents as re- 
late to that unfortunate transaction, I also transmit by 
this opportunity. 

As Sir Guy Carleton, notwithstanding the acquittal 
of Lippencot, reprobates the measure in unequivocal 
terms, and has given assurance of prosecuting a further 
inquiry, it has changed the ground I was proceeding 
upon, and placed the matter upon an extremely deli- 
cate footing. 

It would be assuming in me to ascribe causes 
for actions different from those, which are ostensibly 
and plausibly assigned ; but, admitting that General 
Carleton has no other object than to procrastinate, he 
has, by disavowing the act, by declaring that it is held 
in abhorrence, by not even sanctioning the motives, 
which appear to have influenced Lippencot to become 
the executioner of Huddy, and by giving the strongest 
assurances that further inquisition shall be made, so 
far manifested the appearance of an earnest desire to 
bring the guilty to punishment, that I fear an act of re- 
taliation upon an innocent person before the result of 
his inquisition is known, w^ould be considered by the 



PabtII.] tiik amkrican rkvolution. :J^7 

impartial and unprejucliced world in an unfavorable and 
perhaps an unjuslifiahle point of view ; and more es- 
pecially as the great end proposed by retaliation, which 
is to prevent a repetition, of outrages, has been in a 
manner answered. For, you will please to observe, by 
the extract from General Clinton's letter of the 2Gth of 
April to Governor Franklin,* that he had exjiressly for- 
bidden the Board of Directors to remove or exchange 
in future any prisoners of w ar in the custody of their 
commissary without having fn-st obtained his approba- 
tion and orders. 

The same reasons, which induced me to lay the 
first steps I took in this affair before Congress, urge me 
to submit it to them at its present stage. It is a great 
national concern, upon which an individual ought not to 
decide. I shall be glad to be favored with the deter- 
mination of Congress as early as possible, as I shall 
.suspend giving any answer to Sir Guy Carleton, until 
I am informed how far they are satisfied with iiis con- 
duct hitherto. 

I cannot close this letter without making a remark 
upon that part of Sir Guy Carleton's, in which he 
charges me with want of humanity in selecting a vic- 
tim from among the British ollicers so early as I did. 
He ought to consider, that, by the usages of war and 
upon the principles of retaliation, I should have been 
justified in executing an ofliccr of equal rank with 
Captain Huddy immediately upon receiving proofs of 
his murder, and then informing Sir Henry Clinton that 
I had done so. Besides, it was impossible for me to 
foresee, that it would be so very long before the mat- 
ter would be brought to some kind of issue.f 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Q,uarters, 28 August, 1782. 

Sir, 
I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency, 
that, in obedience to the resolve of Congress of the 
12th instant, I proposed to Sir Guy Carleton and Ad- 
miral Dighy a meeting of commissioners, for the pur- 
pose of settling a general cartel, which has been ac- 
ceded to upon their part. Previously to the meeting 
of the respective commissioners, and before I can in- 
struct those, who shall be appointed in behalf of the 
United States, it is absolutely necessary that I should 
be made acquainted with the determination of Con- 
gress upon the following points ; whether I am to con- 
firm the exchange of Lord Cornwallis for Mr. Lau- 
rens ; and whether it is their intention, that the pro- 
posal contained in the letter of Sir Guy Carleton and 
Admiral Digby, of the 2d of August, "to exchange 
soldiers for sailors," on the conditions mentioned by 
those gendemen, should be acceded to. The latter, 
should we be fortunate enough to obtain a liquidation 
of accounts (and we must go prepared on the sup- 

the communications of Sir Henry Clinton and Sir Guy Carleton to the 
ministry on this afTair of Captain Huddy ; and justice requires me to say, 
that those commanders expressed the strongest indignation and abhor- 
rence at his execution, and used every possible effort to ascertain the of- 
fenders and bring them to punishment. Lippencot was arrested, and 
arraigned before a court-martial. He denied the jurisdiction of the court, 
and claimed a trial by the civil laws. The matter was then referred to 
the British chief justice in New York, who decided against this claim, 
and Lippencot was remanded to a court-martial and tried. The testi- 
mony did not confirm his guilt. It appeared, that he considered himself 
as acting under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Associated 
Loyalists, which screened him from responsibility in the act. Both Sir 
Henry Clinton and Sir Guy Carleton were extremely dissatisfied with the 
explanations attempted to be given by the Board ; and the odium, if not 
the guilt, of the transaction must for ever remain a reproach to that body.

great point in controversy ; and, as it is one of vast 
political importance, I wish to be explicitly instructed 
upon it by Congress. As I cannot proceed I'urther in

enough to furnish mc with them as soon as Congress

care of attending to that post. Stony Point, and Dobbs's

point out to you the great outlines of your duty. I 
recommend the following matters to your attention. 

To visit the redoubts frequently ; to see that they ai'e 
kept in proper order ; that the garrisons allotted to 
them are alert, and that they make it an invariable 
rule to sleep within the works. They should each be 
furnished constantly with ten days' wood and water;

and, if the contractors keep up such a magazine of 
salt provision upon the Point, as they ought to do by 
contract, the detached works should be provided with 
ten days' provision also. The rolls to be frequently 
called. No officer to be absent without your leave, 
and no non-commissioned officer or soldier without 
the leave of a field-officer. 

The quarter-master having reported a scarcity of

may be delivered up. No buildings, either public or 
private, are to be erected without your knowledge ; and, 
when applications are made to you for that purpose, 
you will, if they are admitted, direct the commanding 
engineer to point out the situations, that they may not 
interfere with the defences of the place. The public 
buildings now carrying on, and the alterations and re- 
pairs of the works, will engage youi' particular atten- 
tion. You know the necessity of bringing them to a

was in consequence of an agreement with Count de Rochambeau to form

to be nearer to the enemy in case any hostile attempts should be made

of Sir Guy Carleton, such attempts were not anticipated.

place soon after the 7th of Auajiist. I h;i\ e, upon this 
informatiDn, written to Major-General Sinaliwood and 
Colonel Butler to send forward to this army the re- 
cruits of Maryland and Pennsylva»i;i, who are at An- 
napolis and Carlisle. I enclose the letters under fl} ing 
seals to you, that you may take the sense of Congress 
upon the matter, before the orders are carried into 
execution. 

Congress having determined what troops should com- 
pose the southern ai-my, I do not think myself abso- 
lutely at liberty to withdraw those, which are already 
there, or to stop the reinforcements intended for them, 
without first consulting Congress, which I mean to do 
through you. So long ago as the 18th of March last, 
I calculated from appearances upon the evacuation of 
the southern States; and I then wrote to General 
Greene to hold himself in readiness to march to the 
northward the moment such an event should seem cer- 
tain. In my idea, the infantry apportioned to the two 
Carolinas and Georgia will be sullicient to be left in 
the southern quai-ter. The South Cai-olina regiment 
of artillery having been reformed, it may be thought 
necessary to leave the small remains of Harrison's and 
late Procter's there. It will be necessary, also, to con- 
sider what corps of horse shall remain. If Armand's 
legion have not yet removed from Charlottesville, they 
certainly ought not to proceed. After having consulted 
Congress, and made the proper arrangements, you will 
please to inform Major- General Greene of the result, 
that he may govern himself accordingly. The difficulty 
and enormous expense of supporting troops at the 
southward are sufficient inducements to draw as many 
from thence as we possibly can.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 8 September, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have the honor to reply to your Excellency's letter 
of the 23d of August, and to inform you, that Major- 
Generals Heath and Knox are nominated by me to 
meet Lieutenant-General Campbell and Mr. Elliot, as 
commissioners for the purpose of settling a general 
cartel for an exchange of prisoners. I propose, Sir, 
that the meeting be held at Tappan, as an intermedi- 
ate and convenient place, and that it commence on the 
18th day of this month, at which time my commission- 
ers will attend, and will be accompanied by the com- 
missary of prisoners.* Your Excellency's favor of the 
29 th, enclosing a copy of Governor Livingston's letter 
to you of the 10th, came in due time to my hands. 
I am at a loss to discover for what purpose it was 
communicated to me ; especially as I have more than 
once observed to you, that in matters of civil resort 
I have ever avoided any interference, and have trans- 
mitted to you the approbation of the sovereign power 
of these United States for my so doing. And of this

nature appears to be the case of Ezekicl Tilton, who is 
the subject of your correspondence with the Governor. 

I cannot help remariiing, that your Excellency has 
several times lately taken occasion to mention, that "all 
hostilities stand suspended on your part." I must con- 
fess, that, to me, this expression wants explanation. I 
can iiave no conception of a suspension of hostilities, 
but that which arises from a mutual agreement of the 
powers at w ar, and which extends to naval as well as 
land operations. That your Excellency has thought 
proper, on }our part, to make a partial suspension, may 
be admitted ; but, whether this has been owing to po- 
litical or other motives, it is not for me to decide. It 
is, however, a well known fact, that at the same time 
the British cruisers on our coasts have been more than 
usu;ilJy alert ; and, while Americans are admitted to un- 
derstand their real interests, it will be difficult for them, 
when a suspension of hostilities is spoken of, to separate 
the idea of its extending to the sea as well as land. 

I cannot ascribe the inroads of the savages upon our 
northwestern frontier to the causes, from which your 
Excellency supposes them to originate ; neither can I 
allow, that they are committed without directions from 
the commander-in-chief in Canada. For by pris- 
oners and deserters it is apparent, that those ravaging 
parties are composed of white troops, uikK r the com- 
mand of officers regularly commissioned, as well as 
savages; and it would be a solecism to suppose, that 
such parties could be out, without the knowledge of 
their commander-in-chief. I have the honor to be, &c.* 

• Sir Guy Carleton had wriUen ; — " If these Indians come not solely 
to revenije the cruelties practised on their brethren, their motives are to 
me wholly unknown. To my knowledge, they cannot have directions 
from tlie commander-in-chief on that side ; and these proceedings not only 
have my disapprobation, but I shall very willingly assist in restoring trao- 
quillity on that frontier also."— j3ugi«< 29M.

TO JAMES MCHENRT, 

Verplanck's Point, 13 September, 1762. 

My dear Sir, 

Our prospects of peace ai-e vanishmg. The death 
of the Marquis of Rockingham has given a shock to the 
new administration, and disordered its whole system. 
Fox, Burke, Lord John Cavendish, Lord Keppel,' and I 
believe others, have left it. Earl Shelburne takes the 
lead, as first lord of the treasuiy, to which oflice he 
was appointed by the King, the moment the vacancy 
happened by the death of Lord Rockingham. This 
nobleman declares, that the sun of Great Britain will 
set the moment American independence is acknowl- 
edged, and that no man has ever heard him give an 
assent to the measure. The Duke of Richmond, on 
the other hand, asserts, that the ministry, of which Lord 
Shelburne is one, came into office upon the express 
condition, and pledged to each other, that America 
should be declared independent ; that he will watch 
him, and, the moment he finds him departing therefrom, 
he will quit the administration, and give it every opposi- 
tion in his po\Aer. 

That the King will push the war, as long as the na- 
tion will find men or money, admits not of a doubt in 
my mind. The whole tenor of his conduct, as well as 
his last proroguing speech, on the 11th of July, plainly 
indicates it, and shows in a clear point of view the im- 
policy of relaxation on our part. If we are wise, let us 
prepare for the worst. There is nothing, which will 
so soon produce a speedy and honorable peace, as a 
state of preparation for war; and we must either do 
this, or lay our account to patch up an inglorious peace, 
after all the toil, blood, and treasure we have spent. 
This has been my uniform opinion ; a doctrine I have

copies of your last publication t lor the amusement of

• The first division of the French army, under Count de Rochambeau, 
arrived at King's Ferry from the south, on tlie 15(h of September. The 
remainder followed, and the whole crossed the river, and formed a junc- 
tion with the American army. Count de Rochambeau describes the event 
as follows. 

" General Washington, wishing to testify his respect for France, and 
his recognition of the benefiu she had rendered, caused us to pass 
between two lines of troops, clad, equipped, and armed with clothing and 
arms from France, and from the En^'lish magazines taken at Yorktown, 
which the French army had relinquished to the .\mcricans. He ordered 
the drums to beat a French march during the whole review, and the two 
armies rejoined with the most lively demonstrations of reciprocal satis- 
faction." — Memoires de Rochambeau, Tom. I. p. 309.

vices. This was done with the knowledge and approbation of General 
Washington, who was then in Philadclpliia. The Crisis waa accord- 
ingly revived, and continued to the end of the war. See on this subject

346 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

Your observations on the period of seven years, as it 
applies to British minds, are ingenious, and I wish it 
may not fail of its effects in the present instance.* 
The measures and the policy of the enemy are at pres- 
ent in great perplexity and embarrassment. But I 
have my fears, whether their necessities, the only ope- 
rating motives with them, have yet arrived to that point, 
which must drive them unavoidably into what they will 
esteem disagreeable and dishonorable terms of peace ; 
such, for instance, as an absolute, unequivocal admis- 
sion of American independence, on the terms upon 
which we can accept it. For this reason, added to 
the obstinacy of the King, and the probable consonant 
principles of some of the chief ministers, I have not 
so full confidence in the success of the present nego- 
tiation for peace as some gentlemen entertain. Should 

* From Painc''s Letter. — "I fully believe we have seen our worst 
days over. The spirit of the war on the part of the enemy is certainly 
on the decline, full as much as we think for. I draw this opinion, not 
only from the difficulties we know they are in, and the present promiscu- 
ous appearance of things, but from the peculiar effect, which certain 
periods of time have more or less upon all men. The British have ac- 
customed themselves to think of the terra of seven years in a manner 
different from other periods of time. They acquire this partly by habit, 
by religion, by reason, and by superstition. They serve seven years ap- 
prenticeship ; they elect their parliament for seven years ; they punish 
by seven years' transportation, or the duplicate, or triplicate of that term ; 
their leases run in the same manner ; and they read that Jacob served 
seven years for one wife and seven years for another; and the same 
term, likewise, extinguislies all obligations (in certain cases) of debt, or 
matrimony ; and thus this particular period, by a variety of concurren- 
ces, has obtained an influence in their minds superior to that of any other 
number. 

" They have now had seven years' war, and are not an inch farther on 
the continent than when they began. The superstitious and the popular 
part will conclude that it is not to be ; and the reasonable part will think 
tliey have tried an unsuccessful scheme long enough, and that it is in vain 
to try it any longer ; and the obstinate part of them will be beaten out, 
unless, consistent with their former sagacity, they get over the matter 
at once, by passing a new declaratory act to hind Time in all cases 
whatsoever, or declare him a rebel." — September 7th.

make myself happy uinler the mistake, consoling my- 
self with the idea of having erred on the safest side, 
and enjoying with as much satisfaction as any of my

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Verplanck'a Point, 23 September, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

I hope before this reaches you, that you will be in 
possession of Charleston, and will have found a glorious 
end to your dilliculties and distresses in the southern 
quarter. 

An application from the government of South Caroli- 
na produced the resolve, of which the enclosed is a 
copy, and which, I doubt not, was immediately trans- 
mitted to you. From your being upon the spot, and 
from your thorough knowledge of southern affairs, I 
shall leave the execution of the resolve in a great 
measure to your own judgment. As you observe in 
your letter of the 12th of August, when my directions 
of the 18th of March last were given, they were upon 
a presumption, that the enemy might evacuate Charles- 
ton in such season, that the troops destined to return 
to the northward miglit be here time enough to render 
service before the close of the campaign ; l)ur, that not 
being the case, their immediate removal does not be- 
come so essential ; and therefore I leave it with you, 
either to retain the corps, which you may ultimately 
determine to send northward, until the weather be- 
comes favorable for marching in the spring, or to send 
them forward immediately as far as Virginia at least, 



348 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

if you find their subsistence more difficult and expen- 
sive, than it would be in the middle States. I will 
just give you a hint, that I fear subsistence will be 
upon a very precarious footing here during the winter ; 
and you know the inconvenience of having troops arrive 
at the cantonment late in the season. 

The arrangement made by you for the distribution 
of the southern army agrees perfectly, in the main, with 
my own judgment. I think, for the following reason, 
that the first and third regiments of cavalry had best 
be left in Carolina. They both belong to Virginia, and 
will more than probably be incorpoi-ated the next year. 
Their separation, therefore, would render the incorpora- 
tion difficult ; and, as cavalry are of no great use in this 
quarter in offensive operations, and more easily sub- 
sisted southward than here, I am not anxious to have 
Lee's legion. But with this you will do as you think 
best. Armand's legion will not advance. I shall re- 
commend their wintering in Virginia, as forage will be 
extremely scarce in all this country, owing to the se- 
verest drought ever known. 

By the resolve before alluded to, I am directed to 
make the necessary inquiry into the circumstances of 
the southern States, and to employ such force therein 
as I may think proper, and to direct you, whilst in the 
southern department, to employ the troops under your 
command offensively or defensively in such manner as 
may be most conducive to the interest of the United 
States. 

The execution of the foregoing, I must, for the reasons 
mentioned in the beginning of my letter, leave also to 
you. Should the enemy evacuate the southern States, 
I know of no offensive operations but against St. Au- 
gustine, or the savages. The former I believe is out 
of our power, even were we authorized to undertake 



1'artII.i tmk amkrican Ki;voi,rTio.N. .■M9 

siicli ;m expedition ; and ilic latter must depend upon 
contingencies. I do not apprcliend nnidi ilangcr l'a)ni 
the savages, when tlic British ai-e expelled I'roiu the 
seacoast. 

You will perceive it is the intention of Congress, 
that you should remain personally at the southward 
until further orders. You will, I doubt not, use every 
iirgument to induce those States to exert themselves 
in raising a permiment force tin- their own defence. 
They cannot expect, that, if the enemy evacuate the 
southern States, and keep a footing at New York, and 
at other places to the northward and eastward, the foi-ce 
of almost half the Union should be kept in the southern 
States for defence only. 

The situation of politics, I mean European, is upon 
so precarious a footing, that I really know not what 
account to give of them. Negotiations were still going 
on at Pans in the middle of July ; but the prospects of 
a peace were checked by the death of the Marquis of 
Rockingham. Dr. Franklin's laconic description of the 
temper of the British nation seems most apt. "They 
are," says he, " unable to carry on the war, and too 
proud to make peace." I am, &c.

Sir, 
Sundry accounts from New York having reached 
me, informing me, that the British were more than 
meditating an enterprise against the squadron of the 
Marquis de Vaudreuil, which they have learnt is at

harbours, and that preparations were making for that

purpose, I have made the Marquis acquainted with 
this intelligence, and the probability of such an event. 
At the same time that I gave this information to the 
French admiral, I wrote a letter to Governor Han- 
cock, requesting, that arrangements may be made with 
the militia of his State, in such a manner as to give 
immediate and effectual support, in aid and protection 
of his Most Christian Majesty's ships, in case an at- 
tempt should be made upon them. The like informa- 
tion I shall give to the governor of the State of New 
Hampshire, and request similar assistance from him, in 
case of the enemy approaching near Portsmouth. With 
the highest regard and esteem, &c. 



TO JAMES DUANE, I^ CONGRESS. 

Verplanck's Point, .30 September, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 
I shall be obliged to you, or some friend in Congress, 
to inform me what has been or is likely to be done with 
respect to my reference of the case of Captain Huddy. 
I cannot forbear complaining of the cruel situation, 
which I now am and oftentimes have been placed 
in, by the silence of Congress in matters of high 
importance, which the good of the service, and my 
official duty have obliged me to call upon them, as the 
sovereign power of these United States, to decide. It 
is only in perplexing and intricate cases, that I have 
requested their orders, being always willing to bear my 
proportion of public embarrassments, and take a full 
share of responsibility. Conscious that I have treated 
that honorable body, and all their measures, with as 
much deference and respect as any officer in the Unit- 
ed States, I expected this aid.

Wliv, tlien, if policy forbids a decision upon the dilH- 
cult points I have referred, I am not to be informed 
of it, is beyond my conception, unless I were to as- 
cribe it to causes, which I Hatter myself do not exist. 
When I refer a matter to Congress, every proceeding 
on my part is suspended, until their pleasure is trans- 
mitted ; and for this it is well known I liave waited 
with unexampled patience. But when no notice is 
taken of my application ; when measures, which I 
might otherwise adopt, are suspended ; when my own 
feelings are wounded, and others perhaps are suH'ering 
by the delay, how is it possible for me to forbear ex- 
pressing my disquietude 1 

The particuUu" cause of it at this time arises from two 
things. First, while I am totally silent to the public, 
vvaitinEC the decision of Con!=rress on the case of Huddv, 
I see publications on this head (importing reflections) 
in one of the Pennsylvania papers, which no man could 
have made, that had not access to my oHicial letter of 
the 19th of August to Congress; and, secondly, be- 
cause I feel exceedingly for Captain Asgill, who was 
designated by lot in retaliation for the death of Captain 
Iluddy. While retaliation was apparently necessary, 
however disagreeable in itself, I had no repugnance to 
the measure. But, when the end proposed by it is 
answered, by a disavowal of the act, by a dissolution 
of the boanl of refugees, and by a promise (whether 
with or without meaning to comply with it, I shall not 
determine), that further inquisition should be made into 
the matter, I thought it incumbent upon me, before I 
proceeded any farther in the matter, to have the sense 
of Congress, who had most explicitly approved, and 
impliedly indeed ordered retaliation to take place. To 
this hour I am held in darkness. 

The letter of Asgill, a copy of which I enclose, and

the situation of his father, which I am made acquainted 
with by the British prints, work too powerfully upon 
my humanity not to wish, that Congress would chalk a 
Hue for me to walk by in this business. To effect this, 
is the cause of the trouble you now receive from, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.* 



TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 2 October, 1782. 

Sir, 
Your Excellency will have been informed, by your 
commissioners, of the causes which obstructed their 
proceeding upon business at the late meeting at Tap- 
pan. The commissioners on the part of the United 
States laid before those appointed by your Excellency 
and Admiral Digby a remonstrance, on the subject of 
the immense expense arising from the support of so 
great a number of British prisoners as we now have 
in our possession, without any present compensation 
or proper security for the payment hereafter. This 
remonstrance your commissioners did not think them- 
selves at Uberty to accept. I am, therefore, under the 
necessity of furnishing your Excellency with a copy of 

* Captain Asgill had been for some time released from close con- 
finement, and allowed to go at large on parole at Chatham and in the 
neighbourhood of that place. He wrote to General Washington, re- 
questing permission to return to Europe, on account of the illness of his 
father, and the distressed state of his mother and sister in consequence 
of that event, and of their anxiety for the fate impending over the son 
and brother. 

In writing to the secretary at war, a week after the above letter. Gen- 
eral Washington said ; " The delay of Congress places me not only in a 
very delicate, but a very awkward situation. Were I to give my private 
opinion respecting Asgill, I would pronounce in favor of his being re- 
leased from his duress, and that he should be permitted to go to hia 
friends in Europe." — October 7th.

from tiie liononibie tlic Congress of tiie United States, 
" that, if this, Hke former representations, should pro- 
duce no cllect, it will be high time to take measures, 
however disagreeable, for diminishing a burthen which 
is become intolerable." I have the honor to be, &lc.* 



TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 2 October, 1783. 

My dear Sir, 

Painful as the task is to describe the dark side of 
our affairs, it sometimes becomes a matter of indispen- 
sable necessity. Without disguise or palliation, I will 
inform you candidly of the discontents, which at this 
moment prevail universally throughout the army. 

The evils, of which they complain, and which they 
suppo.se almost remediless, are the total want of money 
or the means of existing from one day to another, the 
heavy debts they have already incurred, the loss of 
credit, the distress of their families at home, and the 
prospect of poverty and misery before them. It is vain. 
Sir, to suppose, that military men will acquiesce con- 
tentedly with bare rations, when those in the civil walk 
of life, unacquainted with half the hardships they en- 
dure, are regularly paid the emoluments of office. 
While the human mind is inlluenced by the same pas- 
sions and inclinations, this cannot be. A military man 
has the same turn for sociability as a person in civil 
life. He conceives himself equally called upon to live 
up to his rank, and his pride is hurt when circum- 
stances restrain him. Only conceive, then, the mortifi- 

• See Sir Guy Carleton's answer in the Appendix, No. IX. 
VOL. VIII. 45 DD' 



354 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

cation they must suffer (even the general officers), 
Avhen they cannot invite a French officer, a visiting 
friend, or a travelling acquaintance, to a better repast, 
than bad whiskey (and not always that) and a bit of 
beef without vegetables will afford them. 

The officers also complain of other hardships, which 
they think might and ought to be remedied without 
delay ; such as the stopping of promotions, where there 
have been vacancies open for a long time ; the with- 
holding of commissions from those, who are justly en- 
titled to them, and have wairants or certificates of their 
appointments from the executives of their States ; and 
particularly the leaving of the compensation for their 
services in a loose, equivocal state, without ascertaining 
their claims upon the public, or making provision for 
the future payment of them. 

While I premise, that no one I have seen or heard 
of appears opposed to the principle of reducing the 
army as circumstances may require, yet I cannot help 
fearing the result of the measure in contemplation, un- 
der present circumstances, when I see such a number 
of men, goaded by a thousand stings of reflection on 
the past and of anticipation on the future, about to be 
turned into the world, soured by penury and what they 
call the ingratitude of the pubhc, involved in debts 
without one fartliing of money to carry them home, af- 
ter having spent the flower of their days, and many 
of them their patrimonies, in establishing the freedom 
and independence of their country, and suffered every 
thing that human nature is capable of enduring on this 
side of death. I repeat it, that when I consider these 
irritating circumstances, without one thing to soothe 
their feelings or dispel the gloomy prospects, I cannot 
avoid apprehending tiiat a train of evils will follow, of a 
very serious and distressing nature. On the other 



i'irtIIi tin; amkrican ri: volution. 355 

hand, could the ollicers be placed in as good a situa- 
tion, as when they came into service, the contention, I 
am persuaded, would be, not who siiould continue in 
the field, but who should retire to private hfe. 

I wish not to heighten the shades of the picture so 
far as the reality would justify nie in doing it. I could 
give anecdotes of patriotism and distress, which have 
scarcely ever been paralleled, never surpassed in the 
history of mankind. But, you may rely upon it, the pa- 
tience and long-sullering of this army are almost ex- 
hausted, and that there never was so great a spirit of 
discontent as at this instant. While in the field, I think 
it may be kept from breaking out into acts of outrage ; 
but when we retire into winter-quarters, unless the 
storm is previously dissipated, I cannot be at ease re- 
specting the consequences. It is high time for a peace. 

To you, my dear Sir, I need not be more particular 
in describing my anxiet}- and the grounds of it. You 
are too well acquainted, from your own service, with 
the real sufferings of the army, to require a longer de- 
tail. I will, therefore, only add, that, exclusive of the 
common hardships of a military life, our troops have 
been and still are obliged to perform more services 
foreign to their proper duty, without gratuity or re- 
ward, than the soldiers of any other army; for exam- 
ple, the immense labors expended in doing the duty 
of the artificers in erecting fortifications and military 
works, the fatigue of building for themselves barracks 
or huts annually, and of cutting and transporting 
wood for the use of all our posts and garrisons with- 
out any expense whatever to the public. 

Of this letter, which, from the tenor of it, must be 
considered in some degree of a private nature, you may 
make such use as you shall think proper, since the 
principal objects of it are, by displaying the merits, 
the hardships, the disposition, and critical state of the

and esteem, I am, my dear Sir, &.c.* 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 18 October, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 
The death of Colonel Laurens I consider as a very 
heavy misfortune, not only as it affects the public at 
large, but particularly so to his family, and all his pri- 

* To some of the topics of this letter General Lincoln replied, in his 
private capacity, as follows. 

" You mention as a ground of complaint, that the compensation to the 
army for their services is left in a loose, equivocal state, and of this I am 
fully convinced ; and from the knowledge I have of the temper of Con- 
gress, I have little expectation that the matter of half-pay, to which I 
suppose you allude, will be in a better situation than it now is, until it 
shall be recommended by Congress to the several States to provide for 
their own officers ; which I am apprehensive will not be done unless Con- 
gress know in some way or other, that it is the wisii of the officers that 
they should do it. 

" You know. Sir, that no moneys can be appropriated but by the voice 
of nine States. There was not that number in flxvor of half-pay, wlien 
the vote to grant it passed in Congress, which was a vote before the con- 
federation was signed and practised upon, but is not now. I see httle 
probability, that a sum equal to the half-pay will be appropriated to that 
purpose, and apportioned on the several States. Massachusetts is one 
of those States, which have always been opposed to the measure. In- 
deed, there is but one State east of tliis, which agreed to it. In the first 
place, there is too great a part of the Union opposed to the half-pay to 
think of carrying it through. The States in the opposition cannot be 
coerced. They say that they are willing to make a handsome compensa- 
tion by compromise, and tliat they will give a sum whicri shall be just and 
honorable. From this it will be difficult, if not impossible, to persuade 
them to depart. I am myself fully of opinion, that it will be much the 
best for the army to be referred to their several States, and that their ex- 
pectations wUl end in chagrin and disappointments if they look for iialf- 
pay from Congress. Let us for a moment reflect how Congress will avail 
themselves of money to discharge this debt. They cannot appropriate 
any part of tlie sum to this use, which shall be annually apportioned on

vate iVicnds and connexions, to whom his amiable and 
useful cluinictor has rciKlercd him peculiarly dear.* 

The campaign in this quarter is coming lo a close, 
without any events ol" great importance. The inten- 
tions of the enemy at New York still remain undecided. 
Their fleet continues in the harbour, making every 
preparation for sailing, which I fancy is delayed in 
expectation of the arrival of the packet, which is hour- 
ly looked for. It is not yet known, but strongly con- 
jectured, that a detachment of troops will go from 
New York to the West Indies with the fleet. Sir 
Guy Carleton has called in most of his out-posts, con- 
tracted his lines near the city, and is making his gar- 

the several Stales, for the reasons I mentioned before ; there are not nine 
States in favor of it. Should it be said, that it may be paid out of the 
revenue of some general tax, it will not remove the objection. The 
money arising from tliesc general taxes must also be appropriated, if 
such taxes were passed. No one of those proposed has yet passed, and 
I see little probability that any of them will soon, if ever." — October 14lh. 

' The enemy in Charleston sent a detachment from that city to the 
Combahee River, at a place about fifty miles soutli of General Greene's 
camp, for the purpose of collecting rice. The party consisted of about 
five hundred infantry, with armed vessels and empty sloops and schooners. 

Intelligence of this expedition being received in camp. General Gist 
trith the light troops, in wliich Colonel Laurens had a command, was 
ordered to march and oppose the enemy. He arrived on the evening 
of the 2oth of August near Combahee Ferry, where the British detach- 
ment had landed. General Gist caused a work to be llirown up at Che- 
haw Neck, about twelve miles below the Ferry, to annoy the shipping 
when it returned. Colonel Laurens solicited the direction and command 
of that post, and in tlie evening of the Qdth, about fifty infantry, and 
8ome matrosses with a howitz, were ordered to join him. 

The enemy, disappointed in their principal object, reembarked at two 
o'clock in the morning of the 27th, and dropped silently down the river 
with the tide, undiscovered by the patrols till four o'clock, when the 
tniopc at the Ferry were put in motion to prevent their landing, and to 
support Colonel Laurens ; but before thoy arrived at ttie post, the ene- 
my had landed, and brought on an action, in which that accomplished 
and gallant officer was killed. The only other person killed was a cor- 
poral. Two captains, one lieutenant, two sergeants, one corporal, and 
thirteen privates were wounded. — MS. Letter, from General Gist to

the 2d of April, the other delivered by the Prince de

spect and regard for the French nation at large, to 
whom this country is under so great obligations, as well 
as the very favorable impressions I have conceived for 
their particular characters, will secure my warmest at-

noblemen.

you have taken the trouble to convey to me, but feel

risen too high. The ih-ath of the Marquis of Rock-

ferent impressions from those we at lirst received. 
We now begin again to rellect upon the persevering 
obstinacy of the King, the wickedness of his ministry, 
and the haughty pride of the nation, wliieh recall to 
our minds very disagreeable recollections, and a proba-

operations of the campaign are drawing to a close with-

expected, but not yet known to me, should take place, 
and form a paragraph in the page of this year's history.

the enemy's intentions there. It is generally thought,

tured their efforts for the winter will be prosecuted 
with vigor. I have the honor to be, &.c.

with tlie internal police and regulations of the French 
army, under the immediate orders of his Excellency 
the Count de Rochambeau ; with which army it ap- 
pears the persons mentioned in the papers contained in 
your letter are connected. I have, however, in order 
to produce an amicable settlement of the matter, com- 
municated the contents to Colonel Wadsworth, and re- 
quested him to use his utmost endeavours to prevent 
any altercations and quarrels between the citizens of 
this State and the people employed by him. As he has 
engaged, that they will not impede the due execution 
of the civil authority, and as he writes to you by this 
conveyance, I cannot but hope matters will be explain- 
ed to your satisfaction.* 

For my own part I shall still continue to exert all 
my influence and authority to prevent the interruption 
of that harmony, which is so essential, and which has 
so generally prevailed between the army and the in- 
habitants of the country ; and I need scarcely add, that 
in doing this I shall give every species of countenance 
and support to the execution of the laws of the land.

assurances fiom Sir Guy Carleton, that the incursions of 
the savages are stopped by authority, I have it in con- 
templation to withdraw the Continental troops from the 
northward. There are many reasons, which will make 
that measure eligible, unless the troops, who have been 
raised on purpose for the defence of the frontiers of 
this State, should be thought incompetent to the duty, 
even taking into consideration the inactivity of the sea-

by the justice to the governor of the State.

Head-Quarters, 25 October, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency the 
copy of two letters from Count de Vergennes, which 
were sent out in the packet from England, and have 
just come to my hands by a flag of truce from New 
York. They contain a very pathetic and affectionate 
interposition in favor of the life of Captain Asgill. I 
lose no time to forward them by a special messenger 
to Congress without any observations, being persuaded 
that Congress will not hesitate to give a very early 
decision respecting his further treatment.* The en- 
closed newspapers contain iill the information I have 
been able to obtain since the arrival of the packet. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

TO CAPTAIN CHARLES ASGILL. 

Head-Quarters, 13 November, 1782. 

Sir, 

It affords me singular pleasure, to have it in my 
power to transmit to you the enclosed copy of an act 
of Congress, of the 7th instant, by which you are re- 
leased from the disagreeable circumstances in which 
you have so long been. Supposing that you would 
Avish to go into New York as soon as possible, I also 
enclose a passport for that purpose. 

Your letter of the 18th of October came regularly 
to my hands. I beg you to believe, that my not an- 
swering it sooner, did not proceed from inattention to 
you, or a want of feeling for your situation. I daily 
expected a determination of your case, and I thought it 
better to await that, than to feed you with hopes, that 
might, in the end, prove fruitless. You will attribute 
my detention of the enclosed letters, which have been 
in my hands about a fortnight, to the same cause. 

I cannot take leave of you. Sir, without assuring 
you, that, in whatever light my agency in this unpleas- 
ing affair may be viewed, I was never influenced, 
through the whole of it, by sanguinary motives, but by 
what I conceived to be a sense of my duty, which 
loudly called upon me to take measures, however dis- 
agreeable, to prevent a repetition of those enormities, 
which have been the subject of discussion. And that 
this important end is likely to be answered, without 
the effusion of the blood of an innocent person, is not 

inffton for tlie release of her son. It is contained in the Diplomatic 
Correspotiilenee, "Vol. XI. p. 107. These letters were taken into consid- 
eration by Congress, and it was resolved, "that the Commander-in-chief

SiK, 

Your Excellency will have been informed, before

I am, notwithstanding, directed to recall your atten- 
tion to that part of your letter of the 3d of August 
last, in which you say, " I have given orders to the 
judge-advocate to make further inquisition, and to col- 
lect evidence for the prosecution of such other persons 
as may appear to have been criminal in this transac- 
tion." In full confidence, that measures have been 
taken to carry your Excellency's intentions into exe- 
cution, I have to request the favor of you to inform 
inc what probability there is, that the persons, who 
have been really guilty of the action, which has been 
the subject of former discussion, will be brought to a 
proper account. I have the honor to be, &,c.

on Captain Lippencot for the murder of Captain Hud- 
dy, and the other documents relating to that inhuman 
transaction. What would otherwise have been the de- 
termination of that honorable body, I will not undertake 
to say ; but I think I may venture to assure your Ex- 
cellency, that your generous interposition had no small 
degree of weight in procuring that decision in favor of 
Captain Asgill, which he had no right to expect from 
the very unsatisfactory measures, which had been taken 
by the British commander-in-chief to atone for a crime 
of the blackest dye, not to be justified by the prac- 
tices of war, and unknown at this day amongst civil- 
ized nations. I however flatter myself, that our ene- 
mies have been brought to view this transaction in its 
true light, and that we shall not experience a repeti- 
tion of the like enormity. 

Captain Asgill has been released, and is at perfect 
liberty to return to the arms of an aflectionate parent, 
whose pathetic address to your Excellency could not 
fail of interesting every feeling heart in her behalf. I 
have no right to assume any particular merit from the 
lenient manner in which this disagreeable aflair has ter- 
minated. But I beg you to believe. Sir, tliat I most 
sincerely rejoice, not only because your humane inten- 
tions are gratified, but because the event accords with 
the wishes of his Most Christian Majesty, and his royal 
and amiable consort, who, by their benevolence and 
munificence, have endeared themselves to every true 
American. I have the honor to be, &c.*

The Count do Rocliambcaii, who arrived licre this 
morning, thtl me the honor to deliver to nie your letter 
of the 2Uth of November. As your destination was 
not public, when I last had the pleasure of seeing you, 
I could not embrace the opportunity to express to you 
the very great regret I felt at the prospect of our sepa- 
ration. I must therefore beg you to accept this testi- 
mony of that regret, as well as the gratitude I feel, in 
common wiili every virtuous citizen, for the essential 
services you have assisted in rendering to this country. 
At the same time I must entreat you to believe, that 
the many great and amiable qualities, which you pos- 
sess, have inspired me w iih the highest sentiments of 
esteem for your character, and that, wherever you may 
be, nothing will add to my happiness more, than to hear 
from you, and to communicate to you any thing that 
may occur in this part of the world worthy of your 
notice. 

I have only now to assure you of my sincere Avishes 
for your safe and speedy arrival at the place of your 
destination, and for your success and personal glory 
in whatever you may undertake.*

near Peekskill on tlie 22d of October, and went by the route of Hart- 
ford and Providence. Count de Rnchambenu accompanied them to the 
latter place, where he took his leave of them, and returned to General 
Washington's head-quarters on his way to Philadelphia. The command 
of the army then devolved on Baron de Viomenil, who arrived with the

from taking a public leave of your Excellency, operated 
equally against my signifying to the army now under 
your command not only the reluctance with which I 
parted with them, but the grateful sense, which I enter- 
tain, of the very essential services they have rendered 
to America. Your destination being no longer a secret, 
permit me to request the favor of your Excellency to 
make the necessary apologies for me ; to express to 
both the otHcers and men how warmly I feel myself 
interested in whatever concerns their honor and glory ; 
and to assure them it is my ardent wish, that victory 
may attend them wherever the orders of their sov-

critical circumstance, the approbation, regret, and wishes you have hon- 
ored them with at their departure ; these are considerations, by which 
you may be assured there is not an individual officer in this army, who

I to sutler you to leave this country without the warm-

and character. 

Our good friend, the IMarquis de Lafayette, prepai-ed 
me, long before I had the honor to sec you, for tiiose 
impressions of esteem, which opportunities and your 
own benevolent niiuil have since improved into a deep 
and lasting friendsliip ; a friendship, which neither time 
nor distance can eradicate. I can truly say, that never 
in my life have I parted with a man, to whom my soul 
clave more sincerely than it did to you. My warmest 
wishes will attend you in your voyage across the Atlan- 
tic, to the rewai-ds of a generous prince, the arms of

of my highest gratifications to keep up a regular inter- 
course with you by letter. 

I regret exceedingly, that circumstances should with- 
draw you from this country before the final accomplish- 
ment of that independence and peace, which the arms 
of our good ally have assisted in placing before us in 
so agreeable a point of view. Nothing would give me 
more pleasure, than to accompany you in a tour through 
the continent of North America at the close of the 
war, in search of the natural curiosities with which it 
abounds, and to view the foundation of the rising em- 
pire. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Newburg, 14 December, 1782. 

I cannot, my dear General, permit you to depart 
from this country, without repeating to you the high 
sense I entertain of the services you have rendered to 
America, by the constant attention, which you have paid 
to the interest of it, by the exact order and discipline 
of the corps under your command, and by your readi- 
ness, at all times, to give facility to every measure, 
which the force of the combined armies was compe- 
tent to. 

To this testimony of your public character, I should 
be wanting to the feelings of my heart, were I not to 
add expressions of the happiness I have enjoyed in 
your private friendship, the remembrance of which will 
be one of the most pleasant ch-cumstances of my hfe. 
My best wishes will accompany you to France, where 
I sincerely hope, and have no doubt, you will meet with 
the smiles and rewards of a generous prince, and ti.e 
warmest embraces of affectionate friends. Adieu. I 
have the honor to be, with great personal attachment, 
respect, and regard, your obedient and most humble 
servant.*

"It is with infinite satisfaction, that I embrace the earliest opportu- 
nity of sending to Philadelphia the cannon, which Congress were pleased 
to present to your Excellency, in testimony of their sense of the illus- 
trious part you bore in the capture of the British army under Lord Corn- 
Tvallis at York in Virginia. The carriages will follow hy another con- 
veyance. But, as they were not quite ready, I could not resist the 
pleasure, on that account, of forwarding these pieces to you previous 
to your departure, in hopes the inscription and devices, as well as the 
execution, may be agreeable to your wishes." — Z>ecemier 29th.

TO JOSKl'll JONKS, I.V CONGRESS. 

Nfivburg, M December, 1782. 

Dk.vr Sir, 

In the course of a few days, Congress will, I expect, 
receive an aiklress from the army on the subject of 
their grievances. This adilress, though couched in very 
respectful terms, is one of those things, which, though 
unpleasing, is just now unavoidable. For I was very 
apprehensive once, that matters would take a more 
untiuorable turn, from the vai'iety of discontents which 
prevail. 

The temper of the army is much soured, and has 
become more irritable than at any period since the 
commencement of the war. This consideration alone 
prevented me (for every thing else seemed to be in a 
state of inactivity and almost tranquillity) from request- 
ing leave to spend this winter in Virginia, that I might 
give some attention to my long-neglected private con- 
cerns. The dissatisfactions of the army had arisen to 
a great and alarming height, and combinations among 
the ofiicers to resign at given periods in a body were 
beginning to take place, when, by some address and 
management, their resolutions have been converted into 
the form in which they will now appear before Con- 
gress. What that honorable body can or will do in the 

France. "Though I was gone from Philadelphia," said he, "before the 
cannon arrived lliere, give me leave to observe, that your usual atten- 
tion and politeness have been shown to the last moment, of which this is 
a fresh proof. I write to the Chevalier de la Luzerne to keep them till 
peace, when they may be carried over without danger of being taken. 
We are just getting under sail. In this moment I renew to your Ex- 
cellency my sincere acknowledgments for your friendship, and am with 
the most inviolable personal attachment and respect your most obedient 
servant." — January lilh, 1783.

matter, does not belong to me to determine ; but policy, 
in my opinion, should dictate soothing measures ; as it 
is an uncontrovertible fact, that no part of the com- 
munity has undergone equal hardships, and borne them 
with the same patience and fortitude, as the army 
has done. 

Hitherto the officers have stood between the lower 
order of the soldiery and the public ; and in more in- 
stances than one, at the hazard of their lives, have 
quelled very dangerous mutinies. But if their discon- 
tents should be suffered to rise equally high, I know 
not what the consequences may be. The spirit of en- 
thusiasm, which overcame every thing at first, is now 
done away. It is idle, therefore, to expect more from 
military men, than from those discharging the civil de- 
partments of government. If both were to fare alike, 
with respect to the emoluments of office, I would an- 
swer for it, that the military character should not be the 
first to complain. But it is an invidious distinction, and 
one that will not stand the test of reason or policy, that 
one set should receive all, and the other no part (or 
that which is next to it), of their pay. In a word, the 
experiment is dangerous ; and, if it succeeded, would 
only prove, that the one class are actuated by more 
zeal than the other, not that they have less occasion 
for their money. I am, with sincere esteem, &,c. 



TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, SECRETARY 
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

Newburg, 8 January, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
The Marquis, in his letter to me, is not very explicit 
in his sentiments respecting the negotiations of peace, 



I'uiTlI] THE AMERICAN RKVOI^UTION. 371 

but refers me to his ofllcial letter to you for his thoughts 
at large.* In general lie holds up an idea, which per- 
fectly accords with my opinion, that nothing will be 
concluded until the meeting of the British Parliament; 
ami, if matters are not brought to a favorable issue in 
a month afterwai'ds, that the war will rage in all its 
fury. 

Ever since the secession of Mr. Fox and others from 
the administration, I have been decidedly of opinion, 
that peace would not take place before that epoch ; 
that it would depend upon the strength of the con- 
tending parties and their inlliu'nce on the nation, wheth- 
er it would then happen or not ; and that the interme- 
diate space would be employed in intriguing, in an 
investigation of powers, in hearing propositions, and in 
probing the intentions of one another to the bottom. 
These I suppose would have been pretty well under- 
stood on all sides by the 26th of November,t as the 
ground on which Lord Shclhurne is placed also would. 
It follows then, in my judgment, that the ministry 
would communicate to, and take the sense of Parlia- 
ment on the terms upon which peace could be ob- 
tained ; and leave it with the nation to accept them, or 
furnish the means of prosecuting the war vigorously. 
The power given to IMr, Oswald, to treat with any 
commissioner or commissioners properly authorized 
from the United States of America, is more than I 
expected would happen before the meeting of Parlia- 
ment. But, as the gentlemen on the part of America 
could not treat with him unless such powers were 
given, it became an act of necessity to cede them to 
effect their other purposes. Thus I account for the 
indirect acknowledgment of our independence by the

King, who, I dare say, felt some severe pangs at the 
lime he put his hand to the letters patent. It is not, 
however, less efficacious or pleasing on that account ; 
and breaking the ice is a great point gained. There 
can be but very little doubt, I believe, of the conclusion 
of the commercial treaty with Holland ; but I have ap- 
prehensions, that that power will be the most difficult 
to satisfy at the general treaty of peace. 

It is with great pain I hear of the repeal of the im- 
post law in Virginia. What could induce it ? What 
office is Mr. Jeflerson appointed to, that he has, you 
say, lately accepted? If it is that of commissioner of 
peace, I hope he will arrive too late to have any hand 
in it.* My best respects to him when he arrives ; and

* On the 15th of June, 1781, Mr. Jefferson had been appointed a com- 
missioner with Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Laurens, to negotiate a treaty 
of peace, which was then expected to take place through the mediation 
of Russia and Austria. He declined at that time, but on the 13th of No- 
vember, 1782, the appointment was renewed, and he accepted it. He 
was now in Philadelphia, making preparations for his departure ; but, 
winter coming on, and the vessel in which he was to sail from Baltimore 
being frozen up in the harbour, the news of peace arrived in the mean 
time, and he did not undertake the voyage.- — Jeffersoii's Writings, Vol. I.

father, who seems to entertain a very favorable opinion 
of your prialencc, and I hope you merit it, in one or 
two of his letters to mc speaks of the eliHieulty he ie 
under to make you remittances. Whether this arises 
from the scantiness of his funds, or tiie extensivcness 
of your demands, is matter of conjecture with me. I 
hope it is not the latter; because common prudence, and 
every other consideration, which ought to iiave weight 
in a reflecting mind, are opposed to your retjuiring more 
than his convenience and a regard to his other children 
will enable him to pay ; and because he holds up no 
idea in the letter, which would support me in the con- 
clusion. Yet when I take a view of the inexperience 
of youth, the temptations and vices of cities, and the 
distresses to which our A'irginia gentlemen are driven 
by an accumulation of taxes and the want of a market, 
I am almost inclined to ascribe it in part to both. 
Therefore, as a friend, I give you the following advice. 
Let the object, which carried you to Philadelphia, be 
always before your eyes. Remember, that it is not 
the mere study of the law, but to become eminent in 
the profession of it, that is to yield honor and profit. 
The first was your choice ; let the second be your 
ambition. Dissipation is incompatible with both ; the 
company, in which you will improve most, will be least 
expensive to you ; and yet I am not such a stoic as to 
suppose that you will, or to think it right that you 
should, always be in company with senators and phi- 
losophers ; but of the juvenile kind let me advise you 
to be choice. It is easy to make acquaintances, but 
verj- dilFicult to shake them off, however irksome and 
unprofitable they are found, after we have once com- 
mitted ourselves to them. The indiscretions, which 
very often they involuntarily lead one into, prove equal- 
ly distressing and disgraceful.

Be courteous to all, but intimate with few ; and let 
those few be well tried before you give them your con- 
fidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and 
must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity 
before it is entitled to the appellation. 

Let your heart feel for the afflictions and distresses 
of every one, and let your hand give in proportion to 
your purse ; remembering always the estimation of the 
widow's mite, but, that it is not every one who asketh, 
that deserveth charity ; all, however, are worthy of the 
inquiry, or the deserving may suffer. 

Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine men, 
any more than fine feathers make fine birds. A plain, 
genteel dress is more admired, and obtains more credit, 
than lace and embroidery, in the eyes of the judicious 
and sensible. 

The last thing, which I shall mention, is first in im- 
portance ; and that is, to avoid gaming. This is a vice, 
which is productive of every possible evil ; equally in- 
jurious to the morals and health of its votaries. It is 
the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity, and the 
father of mischief. It has been the ruin of many wor- 
thy tamilies, the loss of many a man's honor, and the 
cause of suicide. To all those who enter the lists, it is 
equally fascinating. The successful gamester pushes his 
good fortune, till it is overtaken by a reverse. The los- 
ing gamester, in hopes of retrieving past misfortunes, goes 
on from bad to worse, till grown desperate he pushes 
at every thing and loses his all. In a word, kw gain by 
this abominable practice, while thousands ai-e injured. 

Perhaps you will say, « My conduct has anticipated 
the advice," and " Not one of the cases applies to 
me." I shall be heartily glad of it. It will add not a 
little to my happiness, to find those to whom I am so 
nearly connected pursuing the right walk of life. It

will be the sure road to my favor, and to those honors 
and places of profit, which their country can bestow ; 
as merit rarely goes unrewarded. I am, dear Bushrod,

TO LADY STIRLING. 

Newburg, 20 January, 1783. 
i\Iv L\1)Y, 

Having been informed by a letter from Captain Sill, 
of the unspeakable loss which your Ladyship has ex- 
perienced, I feel the sincerest disposition to alleviate 
by sympathy those soitows, which I am sensible can- 
not be removed or effaced. For this pui-pose, I w ould 
also have suggested every rational topic of consolation, 
were I not fully persuaded, that the principles of phi- 
losophy and religion, of which you are possessed, had 
anticipated every thing that I could say on the subject.* 

It only remains, then, as a small but just tribute to 
the memory of Lord Stirling, to express how deeply I 
share in the common affliction, on being deprived of the 
public and professional assistance, as well as the pri- 
vate friendship, of an officer of so high rank, with whom 
I had lived in the strictest habits of amity ; and how- 
much those military merits of his Lordship, which ren- 
dered him respected in his lifetime, are now regretted 
by the whole army. It will doubtless be a soothing 
consideration in the poignancy of your grief, to find, 
that the general oflicers are going into mourning for him. 

Mrs. Washington joins me in requesting, that your 
Ladyship and Lady Kitty will be assured, that we feel

TO ELIAS BOUDINOT, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.* 

Head-Quarters, 30 January, 1783. 

Sir, 

I should not have undertaken at this time to address 
myself through your Excellency to Congress, on the 
present state of our military and political affairs, which 
are so blended as scarcely to admit of separation in the 
discussion, did I not apprehend that my silence might 
perhaps be construed into remissness in my official 
duties or inattention to the public interests, and that 
some inconvenience might be experienced by the ne- 
glect or delay. Influenced by these motives, and an 
ardent desire to carry the wishes of Congress into 
effect, I shall hope to be excused, after suggesting a 
few things, for entreating to be made acquainted, so far 
as may be deemed expedient, with their sentiments and 
expectations relative to our future operations. 

It scarcely needs be remarked here, as it is a fact 
of great notoriety, that the tranquillity, leisure, and in- 
activity of winter-quarters have ever been considered 
by all well informed warlike nations, when in a state 
of hostility, as the only proper season for taking into 
contemplation the probable operations of the ensuing 
campaign, and for making the best arrangements in their 

* Mr. Boudinot was elected president of Congress on the 4th of No- 
vember. After the departments of finance, war, and foreign affairs went 
into operation, the correspondence of the Commander-in-chief with Con- 
gress passed chiefly througli the hands of the secretaries, and his letters 
were directed to them.

power tor carrying such projects as were finally deter- 
mined upon into execution. It was not sini[»ly in con- 
formity with tliis practice, but upon a perfect conviction 
of the propriety and expediency of it, that at the close 
of my former campaigns I have thought myself not 
only warranted, but impelled by the strongest ilictales 
of reason and duty, to exert all my inlluence and abili- 
ties in endeavouring to augment our force, and to make 
the greatest possible provision in every depai-tment for 
enabling us to act with vigor at the opening of the next 
campaign ; and, in thus attempting to perform my duty, 
I derived no small share of satisfaction from a con- 
sciousness, that I should meet with the approbation 
and assistance of my country ; being at the same time 
so fully acquainted with the designs of the enemy on 
the one hand, ami with the inclinations of Congress on 
the other, that I could not hesitate a moment in my 
own mind to decide what general system of measures 
was proper to be adopted. But, as the complexion 
of our political and military atfairs is now entirely 
changed by the negotiations for peace, which are carry- 
ing on in Europe ; as Congress have determined by 
the reduction which has lately taken place, that the 
number of men engaged on the present establishment 
is adequate to the services before us ; and as that hon- 
orable body have much better opportunities, than any 
individual can have, for collecting and comparing the 
intelligence necessary to judge, with a degree of cer- 
tainty, whether peace will be concluded in the course 
of the winter, so as to supersede the necessity of any 
further military preparations ; I could not think myself 
at liberty, without having recourse to their sentiments, 
to take the same measures and give the same orders, 
that I had on all former occasions deemed myself com- 
petent to do. On the contrary, I feared to delay any

longer to express my apprehensions, that very fair op- 
portunities might be lost, anil that very great, if not 
irreparable injuries might be experienced, (if the war 
should be continued, especially if it should begin to rage 
again,) in case we should not also on our part be in a 
state of preparation for such an event. 

In addition to every other consideration of a foreign, 
a military, or political nature, the embarrassed state of 
our finances, the necessity of using the strictest econo- 
my and preventing every unnecessary expenditure of 
public money in conducting our military affairs, have 
in an especial manner prompted me to make this repre- 
sentation, that the sovereign power may determine, 
what is the proper line of conduct to be pursued under 
our present circumstances ; whether any and what 
preparations ought to be made during the winter ; and 
what our situation wUl be at the period proper for open- 
ing the campaign (supposing the war should continue 
and require any defensive operations on our part), un- 
less many of the essential articles which are wanting, 
particularly in the quartermaster's department, should 
in the mean time be effectually and fully supplied. 
Amongst the most indispensable and yet most ex- 
pensive of which, I must beg leave to mention the 
means of transportation, namely, horses for artillery, 
and teams and wheel-carriages for ordnance, stores, and 
baggage ; without which, it is well known, an army 
becomes perfectly harmless and perfectly helpless ; for, 
so far from being able to annoy and operate against its 
enemy, it is neither able to take the field, nor to ad- 
vance or retire a single step, let the occasions or pros- 
pects be of a nature ever so pressing and important. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing observations, I hope it 
will be clearly understood, that it is very far from being 
my wish or desire, that our military preparations should 



I'aki 11 1 TIIR AMERICAN K K VO I,U I' 1 ON . ^^79 

be increased in the smallest degree beyond what the 
exigence of the eircunistanccs may appear to deinanil. 
But, while 1 candidly confess, that 1 believe there is no 
in:ui, who more earnestly wishes a speedy period may 
be put to the contest than myself, I must take the liber- 
ty to suggest, whether, in case a peace should not 
take place in consequence of the present negotiations, it 
would not be far more eligible in point of national policy 
and economy to attempt, by one great and decisive ef- 
fort, to expel the enemy from the remaining part of their 
possessions in the United States, than to sulTer them 
with their enl'eebled force to liold a post and protract the 
war, until the accumulating expenses of our languid and 
defensive measures shall amount to such an aggregate 
sum, as would have furnished the means of attempting 
tlie siege of New York with a prospect of success? 

In order that your Excellency and Congress may 
have a comprehensive and complete view of our ef- 
ficient force, our military apparatus, and the principal 
articles, which would be required for a vigorous cam- 
paign, I have thought it expedient to forward the en- 
closed returns and estimates (the estimate of the en- 
gineer being omitted, because the articles in his depart- 
ment will be principally provided by the labors of the 
armv) ; and I flatter myself it will be found, that the 
troops under my orders are at this moment as much 
collected and as well appointed, as could possibly be 
expected under our circumstances ; and that all the 
means, which have been afforded, so far as depended 
on military arrangements, have been economized in the 
most prudent manner.* I wait with great solicitude to

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Newburg, 6 February, 1783. 

My DEAR Sir, 
It is with a pleasure, which friendship only is sus- 
ceptible of, that I congratulate you on the glorious end 
you have put to hostilities in the southern States. The 
honor and advantage of it, I hope and trust you will 
long live to enjoy. When this hemisphere will be 
equally fi'ee, is yet in the womb of time to discover. 
A httle while, it is presumed, will disclose the determi- 
nations of the British senate with respect to peace or 
war, as it seems to be agreed on all hands, that the 
present premier, especially if he should lind the oppo- 
sition powerful, intends to submit the decision of these 
matters to Parliament. The speech, the addresses, and 
debates, for which we are looking in every direction, 

happy to receive his sentiments either on the political or military affairs 
of these States, the utility of which they liave upon so many occasions 
experienced, have paid all the attention to his letter of the 30th of Jan- 
uary, which the importance of it demands. 

" That, should the war continue anotlier campaign, every motive of 
policy and economy would operate in favor of the enterprise suggested ; 
but that, such are the present situation and prospects of these States, 
that it would be inexpedient at this time to determine upon the plan, or 
to enter upon the expensive preparations, wbich it would require.

other intelligence, afford appearances of an approaching peace.

the gloomy prospect of tiie otiier may be discovered. 
If historiographers should he hardy enough to fill the 
page of history with the advantages, that have been 
gained with unequal numbers, on the part of America 
in the course of this contest, and attempt to relate the 
distressing circumstances under which they have been 
obtained, it is more than probable, that posterity will 
bestow on their labors the epithet and marks of fiction ; 
for it will not be believed, that such a force as Great 
Britain has employed for eight years in this country 
could be ballled in their plan of subjugating it, by num- 
bers infinitely less, composed of men oftentimes half 
starved, always in rags, without pay, and experiencing 
at times every species of distress, which human nature 
is capable of undergoing.

TO JOSEPH JOJVES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 11 February, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I am about to write you a letter on a subject equally 
important and delicate, which may be extensive in its 
consequences and serious in its nature. I shall confine 
myself to the recital of what I believe to be facts, and 
leave it with you to make deductions. 

The printed remonstrance of Mr. Chittenden and his 
Council, addressed to the president of Congress and 
founded upon the resolves of the 5th of December 
last, contains a favorable recital in their own behalf, of 
what I suppose to be facts ; but, if my memory serves 
me, it is an uncandid performance, inasmuch as it keeps 
out of view an important transaction of theirs, which 
was consequent on those resolves.* Be this as it may, 
matters seem to be approaching too fast to a disagreea- 
ble issue, for the quiet of my mind. The resolves on 
one hand, and the remonstrance on the other, unless 
it should be annulled by the legislature at their next 
meeting, which I do not expect, seem to leave litde 
room for an amicable decision. 

Affairs being thus situated, permit me to ask how far, 
and by what means, coercion is to be extended ? The 
army, I presume, will be the answer to the latter. Cir- 
cumstances (for there can be no determination after 
blood is once drawn) alone can prescribe bounds to the

ject explained, in Slade's Vermont State Papers, pp. 176- 186. 



PautII.! Tin: amkrican r kvolution. 383 

fornuT. It lias been said, Imt of this you can juilge 
bolter than I, that tlie delegates from llie New England 
States in Congress, or a niajority of thc^ni, are willing 
to admit these people into liie Federal Union, as an in- 
dependent and sovereign State. Be this as it may, two 
things 1 am sure of, namely, that they have a powerful 
interest in those States, and pursued very politic meas- 
ures to strengthen and increase it, long before I liatl any 
knowledge of the matter, and before the tendency of it 
was seen into or suspected, by granting upon very ad- 
vantageous terms large tracts of land, in which, I am sor- 
ry to find, the army in some degree have participattul. 

Let me next ask, by whom is that district of country 
principally settled? And of whom is your present army 
(I do not confine the question to this part of it, but 
will extend it to the whole) composed? The answers 
are evident, — New England men. It has been the 
opinion of some, that the appearance of force would 
awe these people into submission. If the General As- 
sembly ratify and confirm what Mr. Chittenden and his 
Council have done, I shall be of a very different senti- 
ment ; and, moreover, that it is not a trilling force that 
will subdue them, even supposing they derive no aid 
from the enemy in Canada ; and that it would be a 
very arduous task indeed, if they should, to say nothing 
of a diversion, which may and doubdess Wduld he made 
in their favor from New York, if the war with Great 
Britain should continue. 

The country is very mountainous, full of defiles, and 
extremely strong. The inhabitants, for the most part, 
are a hardy race, composed of that kind of people, 
who are best calculated for soldiers ; in truth, who are 
soldiers ; for many, many hundreds of them are de- 
serters from this army, who, having acquired property 
there, would be desperate in the defence of it, well 



384 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 



knowing that they were fighting with halters about their 
necks. 

It may be asked, if I am acquainted with the senti- 
ments of the army on the subject of this dispute. I 
readily answer, No, not intimately. It is a matter of 
too delicate a nature to agitate for the purpose of infor- 
mation. But I have heard many officers of rank and 
discernment, and have learned by indirect inquiries 
that others, express the utmost horror at the idea of 
shedding blood in this dispute ; comparing it in its con- 
sequences, though not in its principles, to the quarrel 
with Great Britain, who thought she was only to hold 
up the rod and all would be hushed. I cannot at this 
time undertake to say, that there would be any difficulty 
with the army, if it were to be ordered upon this ser- 
vice, but I should be exceedingly unhappy to see the 
experiment. For, besides the reasons before suggested, 
I believe there would be a great and general unwilling- 
ness to embrue their hands in the blood of their breth- 
ren. I have to add, that almost at the same instant a 
number of the printed copies of the remonstrance were 
disseminated through the army. What effect it will 
have, I know not. The design is obvious. 

I promised in the beginning of this letter, that I 
should content myself with a simple relation of facts. 
I shall only lament, therefore, that Congress did not 
in the commencement of this dispute act decidedly. 
This matter, as you well know, was much agitated last 
winter, and a committee of Congress, with whom I had 
the honor to be in conference, and of which I believe 
you were one, approved of my writing an answer to the 
effect it was given.* With great regard, I am, &c.

Head-Quarters, Nowburg, 25 February, 17*3. 

Sir, 

I am sorry to acquaint your Excellency, for the in- 
lorniation of Congress, that a project, which I had form- 
ed for attacking the enemy's post at Oswego, as soon 
as the sleighing should be good and the ice of the 
Oneida Lake should have acquired suflicient thickness 
to admit the passage of the detachment, has miscarried. 
The report of Colonel Willett, to wliom I had entrusted 
the command of the pai-ty, consisting of a pai-t of the 
Rhode Island regiment, and the State troops of New 
York, in all about five hundred men, will assign reasons 
for the disappointment. 

Although the expedition has not been attended with 
success, the officers and soldiers employed on it are 
entitled to great credit for the spirit, activity, and pa- 
tience exhibited by them in the course of the attempt; 
and, I am certain, nothing that depended upon Colonel 
Willett to give efficacy to it was wanting.* 

Major Tallmadge, whom I had placed contiguous to 

Commander-in-chief, from the firm, steady, persevering, and able manner 
he had conducted die war ; his known integrity, wisdom, and virtue, gave 
him more influence over tlie legislature of Vermont, than any other man 
in existence." p. 223. 

• The expedition failed tlirough the treachery or ignorance of an In-

within five miles of Fort Oswego, when his principal guide lost his way, 
and the darkness and e.xtreme fatigue of walking on snow-shoes pre- 
vented their discovering tlio fort, till the morning dawned, and it was 
necessary to retire. In reply to Colonel Willett's letter reporting the 
result. General Washington said ; " I cannot omit expressing to you the 
high sense I entertain of your persevering exertions and active zeal in 
this expedition, and begging you to accept my warmest thanks ; and that

the same time I am under the necessity of declaring, 
in my own vindication, that, unless the civil powers of 
the different States will adopt the most energetic meas- 
ures, and make the greatest exertions to carry them 
into effect, it will be impossible to put a stop to an 
evil, which has increased to an alarming height, and

TO LIKirrK.VAXT-COLONKl. WILLIA.M S. SMITH. 

Ncwburg, 3 March, 1783. 

Dkau Silt, 

It is imirli to be regretted, that, while I am using 
every means in my power to comply with the orders 
of Congress, founded in my judgment on our true in- 
terest and policy, there should be such a counterac- 
tion as we daily experience from individuals. But lam- 
entable indeed is our situation, when States, or the 
administration of them, are leaping over those bounds, 
which should ever be deemed the sacred barrier be- 
tween us and the enemy, without which all opposi- 
tion to their measures must soon cease, or dwindle 
into something ridiculous. 

That the intercourse with New York by way of the 
Sound is in a manner without restriction, I have little 
doubt ; and that the very boats, which are armed and 
commissioned for the purpose of cutting off the com- 
munication, are employed in facilitating the trade, I 
have a recent instance in one caught by INIajor Tall- 
madge in the act and with the goods on board. We 
have only to persevere, and with the means that we 
possess give all the checks to it in our power. Eve- 
ry officer, who exerts himself in this business, will 
meet all the support I can give, and will undoubtedly 
merit the apj)rohati()n of Congress. 

With respect to the other matters contained in your

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON, IN CONGRESS.* 

Newburg, 4 March, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
I have received your favor of February, and thank 
you for the information and observations which it has 
conveyed to me. I shall always think myself obliged 
by a free communication of sentiments, and have often 
thought, but suppose I thought wrong, as it did not ac- 
cord with the practice of Congress, that the public in- 
terest might be benefited if the Commander-in-chief of 
the army were let more into the political and pecuniary 
state of our affairs than he is. Enterprises, and the 
adoption of military and other arrangements, that might 
be exceedingly proper in some circumstances, would be 
altogether improper in others. It follows, then, by a fair 
deduction, that, where there is a want of information, 
there must be a chance-medley ; and a man may be 
upon the brink of a precipice before he is aware of his 

cut, where the facilities for water communication were afforded through 
the Sound. 

* Colonel Hamilton left the army after the capitulation at Yorktown, 
and took his seat in Congress as a delegate from the State of New 
York on the 25tli of November, 1782. He had previously acted as re- 
ceiver of tlie Continental taxes in the State of New York, under the 
appointment of the superintendent of finance. See Diplomatic Corre- 
spondence. Vol. XII. p. 203. 



I'artII.] THK AMKRICAN REVOLUTION. 389 

(laiif^tT, when a little tbrcknowletif^c might enable him 
to avoid it. But this hy the \>y. 

The hint contained in your letter, and the knowledge 
I have derived from the public gazettes, respecting the 
non-payment of taxes, contains ;J1 the information which 
I have received ol' the danger, tliat stares us in tiie 
face on account of our funds ; and, so far was I from 
conceiving, that our finances were in so deplorable a 
state at this time, that I had imbibed ideas from some 
source of information or other, that, with the prospect 
of a loan from Holland, we should be able to rub along 
yet a little further. 

To you, who have seen the danger, to which the 
army has been exposed, of a political dissolution for 
want of subsistence, and the unhappy spirit of licen- 
tiousness, which it imbibed by becoming in one or two 
instances its own provider, no observations arc neces- 
sary to evince the fatal tendency of such a measure ; 
but I shall give it as my opinion, that it would at this 
day be productive of civil commotions and end in blood. 
Unhappy situation this ! God forbid we should be in- 
volved in it. 

The predicament, in which I stand as a citizen and 
soldier, is as critical and delicate as can well be con- 
ceived. It has been the subject of many contemplative 
hours. The sufferings of a complaining army on one 
hand, and the inability of Congress and tardiness of 
the States on the other, arc the forebodings of evil, 
and may be productive of events, which are more to 
be deprecated than prevented. But I am not without 
hope, if there is such a disposition shown, as prudence 
and policy will dictate, to do justice, that your appre- 
hensions in case of peace are greater than there is 
cause for. In this, however, I may be mistaken, if 
those ideas, which you have been informed arc propa- 



390 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 61. 



gating in the army, should be extensive ; the source of 
which may be easily traced, as the old leaven it is said, 
for I have no proof of it, is again beginning to work 
under a mask of the most perfect dissimulation and ap- 
parent cordiality. 

Be these things as they may, I shall pursue the same 
steady line of conduct, which has governed me hith- 
erto ; fully convinced, that the sensible and discerning 
pai-t of the army cannot be unacquainted, although I 
never took pains to inform them, with the services I 
have rendered it on more occasions than one. This, 
and pursuing the suggestions in your letter, which I am 
happy to find coincide with my practice for several 
months past (which has turned the business of the ar- 
my into the channel where it now is), leave me un- 
der no great apprehension of its exceeding the bounds 
of reason and moderation, notwithstanding the prevail- 
ing sentiment is, that the prospect of compensation for 
past services will terminate with the war. 

The just claims of the army ought, and it is to be 
hoped will have their weight with every sensible legisla- 
ture in the United States, if Congress point to their de- 
mands, and show, if the case is so, the reasonableness of 
them, and the impracticability of complying with them 
without their aid. In any other point of view, it would 
in my opinion be impolitic to introduce the army on 
the tapis, lest it should excite jealousy and bring on its 
concomitants. The States cannot surely be so devoid 
of common sense, common honesty, and common poli- 
cy, as to refuse their aid on a full, clear, and candid 
representation of facts from Congress ; more especially 
if these should be enforced by members of their own 
body, who might demonstrate what the inevitable con- 
sequences of failure will lead to. 

In my opinion it is a matter worthy of considera-

tion, how lar an adjournment of Congress for a few 
months is ailvisahle. The tielegates in lliat case, if 
they are in union themselves respecting the great de- 
fects of our constitution, may represent them fully and 
boldly to their constituents. To me, who know nothing 
of the business which is l)efore Congress, nor of the 
arcamx, it appears that such a measure would tend to 
promote tlie public weal ; for it is clearly my o{)inion, 
unless Congress have powers competent to all general 
purposes, that the distresses we have encfunitered, the 
expense we have incurred, and the blood we have spilt, 
will avail us nothing. 

The contents of your letter are known only to my- 
self. Your pruilence will be at no loss to know what 
use to make of these sentiments. 

I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 7 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

While applications arc making in favor of others, I 
cannot refrain from mentioning to Congress the case 
of Colonel Armand with respect to promotion. Justice 
to that gentleman obliges me to express the esteem I 
have of him, as an intelligent, active, and very deserv- 
ing officer ; one who has been zealous in the service 
of the United States, and who, I am persuaded, has 
expended considerable sums for the establishment of 
his corps, which he probably will be a considerable 
time out of, if he expects to be refunded. 

I take particular pleasure in pointing the attention 
of Congress to Colonel Armand, as his character and 
merits have gained my respect, and his promotion, I

among the oldest colonels in the service of the United 
States. I am, &c.* 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 12 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

It is with inexpressible concern I make the follow- 
ing report to your Excellency. Two days ago, anony- 
mous notifications were circulated in the army, request- 
ing a general meeting of the olRcers the next day. 
A copy of one of these papers is enclosed. About 
the same time, another anonymous writing, purporting 
to be an address to the officers of the army, was 
handed about in a clandestine manner. It is also en- 
closed. To prevent any precipitate and dangerous 
resolutions from being taken at this perilous moment, 
while the passions were all inflamed, as soon as these 
things had come to my knowledge the next morning, 
I issued the enclosed order. In this situation the af- 
fair now rests. 

As all opinion must be suspended until after the 
meeting on Saturday next, I have nothing further to 
add, except a wish that the measure I have taken to ' 
dissipate a storm, which had gathered so suddenly and 
unexpectedly, may be acceptable to Congress ; and to 
assure them that, in every vicissitude of circumstances, 
still actuated with the greatest zeal in their service, I 
shall continue my utmost exertions to promote the 

* This application in behalf of an officer, who had shown an earnest 
and constant zeal for the American cause throughout tlie war, had its 
just effect, and Colonel Armand was promoted, " for his merit and ser- 
vices," to the rank of brigadier-general.

tion, that Congress have the best intention ol' doing 
ample justice to the army as soon as circumstances 
will possibly ailinil. I Ikuc llie honor to be, &,c.

TO JOSKl'H JO.VES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 12 March, 1783 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter ol' the 26th ultimo, and 
thank you for your information and the freedom of your 
communications. My ollicial letter to Congress of this 
date will inform you of what has happened in this quar- 
ter ; in addition to which, it may be necessary that it 
should be known to you, and to such others as you 
may think proper, that the army, though very irritable 
on account of their long protracted sufferings, have 
been apparently extremely quiet while their business 
was depending before Congress, until four days past. 
In the mean time, it should seem, reports have been 
propagated in Philadelphia, that dangerous combina- 
tions were forming in the army ; and this at a time, 
when there was not a syllable of the kind in agita- 
tion in camp. 

It also appears, that, upon the ai'rival of a certain 
gentleman from Philadelphia in camp, whose name at 
present I do not incline to mention, such sentiments as 
these were immediately and industriously circulated ; 
that it was universally expected the army would not

disband until they had obtained justice ; that the public 
creditors looked up to them for redress of their griev- 
ances, would afford them every aid, and even join them 
in the field if necessary ; that some members of Con- 
gress wished the measure might take eifect, in order 
to compel the public, particularly the delinquent States, 
to do justice ; with many other suggestions of a simi- 
lar nature. From whence, and a variety of other con- 
siderations, it is generally believed, that the scheme was 
not only planned but also digested and matured in 
Philadelphia, and that some people have been playing 
a double game, spreading at the camp and in Philadel- 
phia reports, and raising jealousies, equally void of 
foundation, until called into being by their vile arti- 
fices ; for, as soon as the minds of the army were 
thought to be prepared for the transaction, anonymous 
invitations were circulated, requesting a general meeting 
of the oflicers the next day. At the same instant ma- 
ny copies of the address to the officers of the army 
were scattered in every State line of it.* 

So soon as I obtained a knowledge of these things, 
I issued the order of the 11th, transmitted to Congress, 
in order to rescue the foot, that stood wavering on the 
precipice of despair, from taking those steps, which 
would have led to the abyss of misery, while the pas- 
sions were inflamed and the mind tremblingly alive 
with the recollection of past sufferings, and with pres- 
ent feelings. I did this upon the principle, that it is 
easier to divert from a wrong to a right path, than to 
recall the hasty and fatal steps, that have been already 
taken. 



* In a letter to General Washington recently received from Mr. Jones, 
the latter had written ; " Reports are freely circulated here, that there 
are dangerous combinations in the army ; and witliin a few days past it 
has been said, that they are about to declare they will not disband until 
their demands are complied with." — Philadelphia, February 27th.

It is comiuDiily supposed, that, if the olliccrs had 
met agreeably to the anonymous summons, resolutions 
might have been formed, tiie consecjuences of whicli 
may be more easily conceived than expressed. Now 
they will have leisure to view the matter more calmly 
and seriously. It is to be hoped, that they will be in- 
duced to ailopt more rational measures, and wait a 
whiK- loiiL^ir for the settlement of their accounts, the 
postponing of which gives more uneasiness in the army 
than any other thing. There is not a man in it, who 
will not acknowletlge that Congress have not the means 
of payment; but why not, say they one and all, Tujui- 
date the accounts and certify our dues? Are we to 
be disbanded and sent home without this ? Are we 
afterwards lo make individual applications for such set- 
tlements at Philadelphia, or any auditing ofllce in our 
respective States ; to be shifted perhaps from one 
board to another, dancing attendance at all, and finally 
postponed till we lose the substance in pursuit of the 
shadow ? While they are agitated by these consider- 
ations, there are not wanting insidious characters, who 
tell them it is neither the wish nor the intention of the 
public to settle their accounts ; but to delay this busi- 
ness under one pretext or another, until peace, which 
we are on the eve of, and a separation of the army 
takes place ; when, it is well known, a general settle- 
ment never can be effected, and that individual loss 
in this instance becomes public gain. 

However derogatory these ideas are to the dignity, 
honor, and justice of the government, yet when a matter 
so interesting to the army, and at the same time so easy 
to be effected by the public, as that of liquidating the 
accounts, is delayed without any apparent or obvious 
necessity, they will have their place in a mind that is 
soured and irritated. Let me entreat you, therefore. 



396 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

my good Sir, to push this matter to an issue ; and, if 
there are delegates among you, who are really opposed 
to doing justice to the army, scruple not to tell them, 
if matters should come to extremity, that they must 
be answerable for all the ineffable horrors, which may 
be occasioned thereby. I am most sincerely and af- 
fectionately yours. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 16 March, 1783. 

Sir, 
I have the honor to inform your Excellency, for the 
satisfaction of Congress, that the meeting of the offi- 
cers, which was mentioned in my last, was held yes- 
terday ; and that it has terminated in a manner, which 
I had reason to expect, from a knowledge of that good 
sense and steady patriotism of the gentlemen of the 
army, which on frequent occasions I have discovered. 
The report of the meeting, with the other papers, 
which will be necessary to accompany it, I shall do 
myself the honor to transmit to Congress, as soon as 
they can possibly be prepared. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

The result of the proceedings of the grand conven-

I flatter myself, be considered as the last glorious

proof of patriotism, wliicli could have been given by 
men, who aspired to the distinction of a patriot army, 
anil will not only confnm their clain\ to tiie justice, 
but will increase their title to the gratitude, of their 
country.* 

Having seen the proceedings on the part of the ar- 
my terminate witli perfect unanimity, and in a manner 
entirely consonant to my wishes ; being impressed with 
the liveliest sentiments of affection for those, who have 
so long, so patiently, and so cheerfully suffered and 
fought under my immediate direction ; having from mo- 
tives of justice, duty, and gratitude, spontaneously of- 
fered myself as an advocate for their rights ; and hav- 
ing been requested to write to your Excellency, earn- 
estly entreating the most speedy decision of Congress 
upon the subjects of the late address from the army 
to that honorable body ; it now only remains for me 
to perform the task I have assumed, and to intercede 
in their behalf, as I now do, that the sovereign power 
will be pleased to verify the predictions I have pro- 
nounced, and the confidence the army have reposed 
in the justice of their country. 

And here I humbly conceive it is altogether un- 
necessary, while I am pleading the cause of an army, 
which has done and suffered more than any other ar- 
my ever did in the defence of the rights and hberties 
of human nature, to expatiate on their claims to the 
most ample compensation for their meritorious services ; 
because they are perfectly known to the whole world, 
and because, although the topics are inexhaustible, 
enough has already been said on the subject. 

To prove these assertions, to evince that my senti- 
ments have ever been uniform, and to show what my

ideas of the rewards in question have always been, I 
appeal to the archives of Congress, and call on those 
sacred deposits to witness for me ; and, in order that 
my observations and arguments in favor of a future 
adequate provision for the officers of the army may be 
brought to remembrance again, and considered in a sin- 
gle point of view, without giving Congress the trouble 
of having recourse to their files, I will beg leave to 
transmit herewith an extract from a representation 
made by me to a committee of Congress, so long ago 
as the 29th of January, 1778, and also the transcript 
of a letter to the President of Congress, dated near 
Passaic Falls, October Uth, 1780.* That, in the criti- 
cal and perilous moment when the last mentioned com- 
munication was made, there was the utmost danger 
that a dissolution of the army would take place, un- 
less measures similar to these recommended had been 
adopted, will not admit a doubt. That the adoption 
of the resolution, granting half-pay for life, has been 
attended with all the happy consequences I had fore- 
told, so far as respected the good of the service, let 
the astonishing contrast between the state of the army 
at this instant, and at the former period, determine ; and 
that the establishment of funds and securides, for the 
payment of all the just demands of the army, will be 
the most certain means of preserving the national faith, 
and the future tranquillity of this extensive continent, is 
my decided opinion. 

By the preceding remarks it will readily be imagined, 
that, instead of retracting and reprehending, from far- 
ther experience and reflection, the mode of compensa- 
tion so strenuously urged in the enclosures, I am more

and more conlirincd in the sentiment ; :uul, il' in the 
wrong, siiUcr me to please mysell" witli the grateful de- 
lusion. For if, besides the simple payment of their 
wages, a farther compensation is not due to the suffer- 
ings and sacrifices of the oflicers, then have I been 
mistaken indeed. If the whole army have not merited 
Avhatever a grateful people can bestow, then have I 
been beguiled by prejudice, and built opinion on the 
basis of error. If this country should not in the event 
perform every thing, which has been requested in the 
late memorial to Congress, then will my belief become 
vain, and the hope, that has been excited, void of 
foundation. And if, as has been suggested, for the 
purpose of inflaming their passions, " the othcers of the 
iU'my tu'e to be the only sullerers by this revolution ; if, 
retirmg from the field, they are to grow old in pover- 
ty, wretchedness, and contempt ; if they are to wade 
through the vile mire of dependency, and owe the 
miserable remnant of that life to charity, vshich has 
hitherto been spent in honor;" then shall I have learn- 
ed what ingratitude is, then shall I have realized a 
tale, which will embitter every moment of my future 
life. But I am under no such apprehensions. A coun- 
try, rescued by their arms from impending ruin, will 
never leave unpaid the debt of gratitude. 

Should any intemperate or improper warmth have 
mingled itself in the foregoing observations, I must en- 
treat your Excellency and Congress, that it may be 
attributed to the effusion of an honest zeal in the best 
of causes, and that my peculiar situation may be my 
apology ; and I hope I need not, on this momentous 
occasion, make any new protestations of personal dis- 
interestedness, having ever renounced for myself the 
idea of pecuniary reward. The consciousness of hav- 
ing attempted faithfully to discharge my duty, and the 



400 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 51. 

approbation of my country, will be a sufficient recom- 
pense for my services. I have the honor to be, with 
perfect respect, &c. 



TO JOSEPH JOJVES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 18 Marcli, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

The storm, which seemed to be gathering with un- 
favorable prognostics when I wrote to you last, is dis- 
persed, and we are again in a state of tranquillity. But 
do not suffer this appearance of tranquillity to relax 
your endeavours to bring the requests of the army to 
an issue. Believe me, the officers are too much press- 
ed by their present wants, and rendered too sore by 
the recollection of their past sufferings, to be touched 
much longer upon the string of forbearance, in a matter 
wherein they can see no cause for delay ; nor would 
I have further reliance placed upon any influence of 
mine to dispel other clouds, if any should arise from 
the causes of the last. 

By my official letter to Congress, and the papers 
enclosed in it, you will have a full view of my assur- 
ances to, and the expectations of, the army ; and I per- 
suade myself, that the well-wishers to both and to their 
country will exert themselves to the utmost to eradi- 
cate the seeds of distrust, and give every satisfaction 
that justice requires, and the means which Congress 
possess will enable them to do. 

In a former letter I observed to you, that a liquida- 
tion of accounts, in order that the balances might be 
ascertained, is the great object of the army ; and cer- 
tainly nothing can be more reasonable. To have the 
balances discharged at this or in any short time, how- 



Pakt U.J Tin; A Mi; lUC A.N UEVOLUTlUiN. -101 

ever desirable, they know is impracticable, and do not 
expect it ; ;illliougli in the meaii time they must laiior 
under the pressure of these sufferings, which is felt 
more sensibly by a comparison of circumstances. 

The situation of these gentlemen merits the atten- 
tion of every thinking and grateful mind. As ollicers, 
they have been ohlii^ed to dress and appeal- in char- 
acter, to effect wliicii they have been oblii^ed to an- 
ticipate their pay, or ilraw from their estates. By the 
former, debts have been contracted ; i)y the latter, their 
patrimony is injured. To disband men, therefore, un- 
der these circumstances, before their accounts are li- 
quidated imd the balances ascertained, woukl be to set 
open the doors of the jails, and then to shut them up- 
on seven years' faithful and painful services. Under 
any circumstances, which the nature of the case will 
admit, they must be considerable sullerers ; because 
necessity will compel them to part with their certifi- 
cates for whatever they will fetch, to avoid the evils 
I have mentioned above ; and how much this will 
place them in the hands of unfeeling, avaricious specu- 
lators, a recurrence to past experience will suiliciently 
prove. 

It may be said by those, who have no disposition to 
compensate the services of the army, that the oliicers 
have too much penetration to place dependence, in 
any alternative, upon the strength of their own arm. 
I will readily concede to those gentlemen, that no good 
could result from such an attempt ; but I hope they 
will be equally candid in acknowledging, that much 
mischief may (low from it ; and that nothing is to be 
expected from men, who conceive they are ungrate- 
fully and unjustly dealt by ; especially too, if they can 
suppose that characters are not wanting to foment ev- 

VOL. VIII. .51 HH'

ery passion, which leads to discord, and that there are 
— but time shall reveal the rest. 

Let it suffice, that the very attempt would imply a 
want of justice, and fix an indelible stain upon our 
national chai-acter ; since the whole world, as well from 
the enemy's publications (without any intendon to serve 
us), as our own, must be strongly impressed with the 
sufferings of this army from hunger, cold, and naked- 
ness, in almost every stage of the war. Very sincerely 
and affectionately, I am, &c.

Sir, 
I have the honor to acknowledge your Excellency's 
favor of the 12th instant, and to thank you most sin- 
cerely for the intelligence you were pleased to com- 
municate.* The articles of treaty between America 
and Great Britain are as full and as satisfactory as we 
had reason to expect ; but, from the connexion in 
which they stand with a general pacification, they are 
very inconclusive and contingent. From this circum- 
stance, compared with such other intelligence as I have 
been able to collect, I must confess, I have my fears 
that we shall be obliged to worry through another 
campaign before we arrive at that happy period, which 
is to crown all our toils.

TO GOVERNOR HARRISON. 

Newburg, 19 March, 1783. 
Dkak Sir, 

About the first of this month I wrote you a long 
letter. I touched upon the state of the army and the 
situation of public creditors, and wished to know from 
you as a friend, what causes had induced the Assembly 
of Virginia to withdraw their assent to the impost law, 
and how the Continental creditors without adequate 
funds were to come at or obtain security for their 
money. I little expected at the time of writing that 
letter, that we were on the eve of an important cri- 
sis to this army, when the touchstone of discord was 
to be applied, and the virtue of its members to un- 
dergo the severest trial. 

You have not been altogether unacquainted, I dare 
say, with the fears, the hopes, the apprehensions, and 
the expectations of the army, relative to the provision, 
which is to be made for them hereafter. Although a 
firm reliance on the integrity of Congress, and a be- 
lief that the public would finally do justice lo all its 
servants and give an indisputable security for the pay- 
ment of the half-pay of the ofiicers, had kept them 
amidst a variety of sufferings tolerably quiet and con- 
tented for two or three years past ; yet the total want 
of pay, the little prospect of receiving any from the 
unpromising state of the public finances, and the abso- 



404 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 5i. 

lute aversion of the States to establish any Continental 
funds for the payment of the debt due to the army, 
did at the close of the last campaign excite greater 
discontents, and threaten more serious and alarming 
consequences, than it is easy for me to describe or you 
to conceive. Happily for us, the officers of highest 
rank and greatest consideration interposed ; and it was 
determined to address Congress in an humble, pathetic, 
and explicit manner. 

While the sovereign power appeared perfectly well 
disposed to do justice, it was discovered that the States 
would enable them to do nothing ; and in this state 
of affairs, and after some time spent on the business 
in Philadelphia, a report was made by the delegates of 
the army, giving a detail of the proceedings. Before 
this could be fully communicated to the troops, while 
the minds of all were in a peculiar state of inquietude 
and irritation, an anonymous writer, though he did 
not step forth and give his name boldly to the world, 
sent into circulation an address to the officers of the 
army, which, in point of composition, in elegance and 
force of expression, has rarely been equalled in the 
English language, and in which the dreadful alternative 
was proposed, of rehnquishing the service in a body, if 
the war continued, or retaining their arms in case of 
peace, until Congress should comply with all their de- 
mands. At the same time, and at the moment when 
their minds were inflamed by the most pathetic repre- 
sentations, a general meeting of the officers was sum- 
moned by another anonymous production. 

It is impossible to say what would have been the 
consequences, had the author succeeded in his first 
plans. But, measures having been taken to postpone 
the meeting, so as to give time for cool reflection and 
counteraction, the good sense of the officers has ter- 



1'akt 11.] Tin; AMERICAN K EVOLUTION. -105 

minateil this alVair in a manner, which rellcct.s the great- 
est glory on themselves, and demands the highest ex- 
pressions of gratitude from tiieir country. 

The proceedings have been reported to Congress, 
and will probably be published lor the satisfaction of 
the people of these United States. In the mean time 
I thought it necessary to give you these particulars, 
principally with a design to communicate to you with- 
out reserve my opinion on this interesting subject 
For, notwithstanding the storm has now passed over, 
notwithstanding the officers have in despite of their 
accumulated suflferings given the most unequivocal and 
exalted proofs of patriotism, yet I believe, unless justice 
shall be done, and funds effectually provided for the 
payment of the debt, the most deplorable and ruinous 
consequences may be apprehended. Justice, honor, 
gratitude, policy, every thing is opposed to the conduct 
of driving men to despair of obtaining their just rights, 
after serving seven years a painful life in the field. I 
say in the field, because they have not during that pe- 
riod had any thing to shelter them from the inclemency 
of the seasons but tents, and such houses as they 
could build for themselves. 

Convinced of this, and actuated as I am, not by pri- 
vate and interested motives, but by a sense of duty, a 
love of justice, and all the feelings of gratitude towards 
a body of men, who have merited infinitely well of 
their country, I can never conceal or suppress my sen- 
timents. I cannot cease to exert all the abilities I am 
possessed of, to show the evil tendency of procrasti- 
nated justice (for I will not suppose it is intended ul- 
timately to withhold it), nor fail to urge the establish- 
ment of such adequate and permanent funds, as will 
enable Congress to secure the payment of the public 
debt, on such principles as will preserve the national

the public. With great esteem and regard, I am, &,c. 

P. S. The author of the anonymous address is yet 
behind the curtain ; and, as conjecture may be ground- 
ed on error, I will not announce mine at present. 



TO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

Head-Quarters, 10 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

I am exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for 
your communication of the 15th. The articles of trea- 
ty between America and Great Britain, as they stand 
in connexion with a general pacification, are so very 
inconclusive, that I am fully in sentiment with your 
Excellency, that we should hold ourselves in a hostile 
position, prepared for either alternative, peace or war. 
I shall confer with the Duke de Lauzun on the sub- 
jects you are pleased to mention ; and, as I have ever 
viewed the practice of the States in supplying the en- 
emy in New York with the means of subsistence as 
a very pernicious one in its tendency, both to our- 
selves and our allies, you may depend upon me to 
exert every measure in my power to prevent it. 

I am at all times happy in receiving intelligence 
from your Excellency ; and, should it be in your pow- 
er to announce a general peace, you cannot make a 
more pleasing communication to me. Persuaded of 
the pure and benevolent intentions, which animate the 
breast of his Most Christian Majesty, I am assured, if 
that happy event should not result from the present 
negotiation, that the failure will not rest on his part. 

I have the honor to be, &.c.

In a lutter, wliicli I have lately received from the

sentiments respecting his absence may be communi-

not because I conceive the testimony of my approba-

this letter. Congress have had too many unequivoc;iI 
proofs of the zeal of this young nobleman, his attach- 
ment to the American cause, and his important ser- 
vices in it, to entertain a doubt of the proj)nety of his 
present absence. Sure I am, that his return will be 
as soon as he can make it subservient to the inter-

lency has been so good as to announce to me, has 
filled my mind with inexpressible satisfaction ; and 
permit me to add, that the joy I feel on this great 
event is doubly enhanced by the very obliging man- 
ner in which you have been pleased to express your 
congratulations to me and to the army on this happy 
occasion.*

408 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

The part your Excellency has acted in the cause 
of America, and the great and benevolent share you 
have taken in the establishment of her independence, 
are deeply impressed in my mind, and will not be ef- 
faced from my remembrance, or that of the citizens 
of America. You will accept, Sir, my warmest ac- 
knowledgments and congratulations, with assurances 
that I shall always participate, with the highest pleas- 
ure, in every event, which contributes to your happi- 
ness and satisfaction. 

The articles of the general treaty do not appear so 
favorable to France, in point of territorial acquisitions, 
as they do to the other powers. But the magnani- 
mous and disinterested scale of action, which that great 
nation has exhibited to the world during this war, and 
at the conclusion of peace, will insure to the King 
and nation that reputation, which will be of more con- 
sequence to them than ever}' other consideration. 

Mrs. Washington begs your Excellency to accept 
her sincerest thanks for the joy you have communi- 
cated to her, and to receive a return of her congrat- 
ulations on this most happy of all events.

Your Excellency will permit me, with the most 
lively sensations of gratitude and pleasure, to return 
you my warmest thanks for the communication, which 
you have been pleased to make to me and to the ar-

which cannot fail to ditluse a general joy throughout

with which I beg your Excellency to accept a return of 
my sincerest congratulations on this happiest of events. 
The commutation of the half-pay, and the measures 
adopted for the liquidation of their accounts, will give 
great satisfaction to the army ; and will prove an ad-

Dear Sir, 

I have duly received your favors of the 1 7th and 
2-1th ultimo. I rejoice most exceedingly that there is 
an end to our warfare, and that such a field is opening 
to our view, as will, with wisdom to direct the culti- 
vation of it, make us a great, a respectable, and happy 
people ; but it must be improved by other means than 
State politics, and unreasonable jealousies and preju- 
dices, or it requires not the second sight to see, that

we shall be instruments in the hands of our enemies, 
and those European powers, who may be jealous of our 
greatness in union, to dissolve the confederation. But, 
to obtain this, although the way seems extremely plain, 
is not so easy. 

My wish to see the union of these States establish- 
ed upon liberal and permanent principles, and inclina- 
tion to contribute my mite in pointing out the defects 
of the present constitution, are equally great. All my 
private letters have teemed with these sentiments, and, 
whenever this topic has been the subject of conversa- 
tion, I have endeavoured to diffuse and enforce them ; 
but how far any further essay by me might be pro- 
ductive of the wished-for end, or appear to arrogate 
more than belongs to me, depends so much upon 
popular opinion, and the temper and dispositions of 
the people, that it is not easy to decide. I shall be 
obliged to you, however, for the thoughts, which you 
have promised me on this subject, and as soon as you 
can make it convenient. 

No man in the United States is or can be more 
deeply impressed with the necessity of a reform in our 
present confederation than myself.* No man perhaps 
has felt the bad effects of it more sensibly ; for to the 
defects thereof, and want of power in Congress, may 
justly be ascribed the prolongation of the war, and con- 
sequently the expenses occasioned by it. More than 
half the perplexities I have experienced in the course 
of my command, and almost the whole of the difficul-

address and management necessary to give weight to

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Head-Quarters, 5 April, 1783. 

My DEAR Marquis, 
It is easier for you to conceive, than for me to ex- 
press, the sensibility of my heart at the communications 
in your letter of the 5th of February from Cadiz. It 
is to these communications we are indebted for the only 
account yet received of a general pacification. INIy 
mind, upon the receipt of this intelligence, was instantly 
assailed by a thousand ideas, all of them contending for 
preeminence ; but, believe me, my dear friend, none 
could supplant, or ever will eradicate that gratitude, 
which has arisen from a lively sense of the conduct of 
your nation, and from my obligations to many of its

bearer of the ratification of the treaty between Great Britain and the 
United States.

illustrious characters (of whom, I do not mean to flat- 
ter, when I place you at the head), and from my ad- 
miration of the virtues of your august sovereign, who, 
at the same time that he stands confessed the father 
of his own people, and defender of American rights, has 
given the most exalted example of moderation in treat- 
ing with his enemies. 

We are now an independent people, and have yet 
to learn political tactics. We are placed among the 
nations of the earth, and have a character to estabhsh ; 
but how we shall acquit ourselves, time must discover. 
The probability is (at least I fear it), that local or State 
politics will interfere too much with the more liberal and 
extensive plan of government, which wisdom and fore- 
sight, freed from the mist of prejudice, would dictate ; 
and that we shall be guilty of many blunders in tread- 
ing this boundless theatre, before we shall have arrived 
at any perfection in this art ; in a word, that the expe- 
rience, which is purchased at the price of difficulties 
and distress, will alone convince us, that the honor, 
power, and true interest of this country must be meas- 
ured by a Continental scale, and that every departure 
therefrom weakens the Union, and may ultimately break 
the band which holds us together. To avert these 
evils, to form a new constitution, that will give consis- 
tency, stability, and dignity to the Union, and sufficient 
powers to the great council of the nation for general 
purposes, is a duty incumbent upon every man, who 
wishes well to his country, and will meet with my aid as 
far as it can be rendered in the private walks of life. 

The armament, which was preparing at Cadiz, and 
in which you were to have acted a distinguished part, 
would have carried such conviction with it, that it is not 
to be wondered at, that Great Britain should have been 
impressed with the force of such reasoning. To this

cause, I am persuadctl, the peace is to be ascribed. 
Your soini; to Madrid from thence, instead of coming 
immediately to this country, is another instance, my 
dear Marquis, of your zeal for the American cause, and 
lays a fresh claim to the gratitude of her sons, who will 
at all times receive you with open arms.* As no oHi- 
cial tlespatches are yet received, either at Philadelphia 
or New York, concerning the completion of the treaty, 
nor any measures taken for the reduction of the army, 
niv detention with it is quite uncertain. Where I may 
be, then, at the time of your intended visit, is too un- 
certain even for conjecture ; but nothing can be more 
true, than that the pleasure, with which I shall receive 
you, will be equal to your wishes. I shall be better 
able to determine then, than now, on the practical)ility 
of accompanying you to France, a country to which I 
shall ever feel a warm affection ; and, if I do not pay it 
that tribute of respect, which is to be derived from a 
visit, it may be ascribed with justice to any other cause, 
than a want of inclination, or the pleasure of going 
there under the auspices of your friendship. 



• Altliough the Spanish government, by the signature of the treaty 
of general peace at Paris, had assented to the independence of the 
United States, yet the King was not inclined to receive a person from 
America in a public diplomatic character at his court. After the declara- 
tion of peace, Mr. CarmichacI, who had been secretary of legation under 
Mr. Jay, was appointed Charg6 d'Affaires from the United States to Spain. 
He was already in Madrid, liaving remained there after Mr. Jay's de- 
parture. The Spanish court declined receiving him in his public capacity. 
He wrote to the Marquis de Lafayette, who was then at Cadiz, and re- 
quested his aid. The Marquis repaired to Madrid, had an intor\'iew with 
the King, and with the principal minister. Count de Florida Blanca, and, 
by prompt and forcible representations, succeeded in procuring an imme- 
diate recognition of Mr. Carmichael's powers as Chargi d'.-VfTaires from 
the United States. The conduct of the Marquis de Lafayette on this 
occasion was highly approved by Congress, and was a proof equally of 
his discretion, good sense, and energy, and of his warm attachment to the 
interests of his adopted country. See Diplomatic Corrmpondenee, Vol. X.

I have already observed, that the determination of 
Congress, if they have come to any, respecting tlie 
army, is yet unknown to me. But, as you wish to be 
informed of every thing that concerns it, I do, for your 
satisfaction, transmit authentic documents of some very 
interesting occurrences, which have happened within 
the last six months. But I ought first to premise, that, 
from accumulated sufferings and little or no prospect 
of relief, the discontents of the officers last fall put on 
the threatening appearance of a total resignation, till the 
business was diverted into the channel, which produced 
the address and petition to Congress, which stand first 
on the file herewith enclosed. I shall make no com- 
ment on these proceedings. To one so well acquainted 
with the sufferings of the American army as you are, 
it is unnecessary. It will be sufficient to observe, that 
the more its virtue and forbearance are tried, the more 
resplendent it appears. My hope is, that the military 
exit of this valuable class of the community will exhibit 
such a proof of amor patrice, as will do them honor 
in the page of history. 

These papers, with my last letter, which was in- 
tended to go by Colonel Gouvion, containing extensive 
details of military plans, will convey to you every in- 
formation. If you should get sleepy and tired of read- 
ing them, recollect, for my exculpation, that it is in com- 
pliance with your request I have run into such prolixity. 
I made a proper use of the confidential part of your 
letter of the 5th of February. 

The scheme, my dear Marquis, which you propose 
as a precedent to encourage the emancipation of the 
black people in this country from that state of bondage 
in which they are held, is a striking evidence of the 
benevolence of your heart. I shall be happy to join 
you in so laudable a work ; but will defer going into

Lord Stirling is no more. He ilifd at Albany in

wish you, her, and your little offspring, all the happi- 
ness this life can afford. I will extend my compli- 
ments to the gentlemen in your circle, with whom I

joyful annunciation of your having received official ac- 
counts of the conclusion of a general peace, and a ces- 
sation of hostihties.* Without official authority from 
Congress, but perfectly relying on your communication, 
I can at this time only issue my orders to the American 
out-posts, to suspend all acts of hostilities until further 
orders. This shall be instantly done ; and I shall be 
happy in the momentary expectation of having it in 
my power to publish to the American army a general 
cessation of all hostilities between Great Britain and 
America. 

To your observations respecting particular articles 
of the peace I am obliged to reply, that it rests with 
Congress to direct measures for the observance of all 
the articles contained in the provisional treaty. You 
may be assured, that, as soon as I i-eceive my instruc-

I shall rejoice in giving every facility in my power to 
carry into complete execution that article of the treaty, 
which respects the restitution of all prisoners of war, 
being perfectly disposed to contribute to diffusing, as 
much as possible, the happy effects of this great event. 

I thank your Excellency for the assurances you are 
pleased to express, of your readiness to cultivate that 
spirit of perfect good will and conciliation, which you 
wish would take place between the King of Great 
Britain and the United States, and the citizens and 
subjects of both countries ; and I beg, Sir, that you 
will please to accept a tender from me of reciprocal 
good will and attention, accompanied with sincere con-

TO HARON STEUBEN. 

Ilead-Quartcrs, 14 April, 1783. 

My dear Baro.v, 

A committee of Congress is appointed to consider 
what arrangements it will be proper to adopt in the 
dilferent depai-tments with reference to a peace. Col- 
onel Hamilton, who is chairman of this committee, has 
written to me on this subject, wishing to know my 
sentiments at large on such institutions of every kind 
for the interior defence of these States, as may be 
best adapted to their circumstances, and conciliate se- 
curity with economy and with the principles of our 
government 

I wish, therefore, to be favored with your thoughts 
on this su!)ject, as soon as possible, that I may compare 
them with my own, and be able to comply with the 
request of the committee, in as full a manner and with 
as little delay as can be. I am, &,c.* 

* The same request was communicated to all the principal officers of 
the army then in camp, and also to Governor Clinton. Several of them 
presented memoirs of considerable length, entering into comprehensive 
and detailed views of what was called a peace establishment. From these 
papers a letter was framed extending to twenty-five folio pages, which 
was forwarded by the Commander-in-chief to the committee of Congress. 

The report handed in by Colonel Pickering, then quartermaster- 
general to Uie army, is interesting from the manner in which many 
topics are discussed, and particularly from the suggestions it contains 
respecting Uic establishment of a military seminary at West Pomt,

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 16 April, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

My last letter to you was written in a hurry, when I 
was fatigued by the more public yet confidential letter, 
which, with several others, accompanied it. Possibly I 
did not on that occasion express myself, in what I in- 
tended as a hint, with so much perspicuity as I ought. 
Possibly, too, what I then dropped might have con- 
veyed more than I intended, for I do not now recollect 
the force of my expressions. 

My meaning, however, was only to inform you, that 
there were different sentiments in the army, as well as 
in Congress, respecting Continental and State funds, 
some wishing to be thrown upon their respective States, 
rather than the continent at large, for payment ; and 
that, if an idea should generally prevail, that Congress, 
or part of its members or ministers, bent upon the lat- 

this time, it must be grounded on the permanent military establishment 
for our frontier posts and arsenals, and the wants of the States, sepa- 
rately, of officers to command the defences on their seacoasts. 

" On this principle it might be e.\pedient to establish a military school, 
or academy, at West Point. And that a competent number of young 
gentlemen might be induced to become students, it might be made a 
rule, that vacancies in the standing regiment should be supplied from 
thence ; those few instances e.xcepted where it would be just to promote 
a very meritorious sergeant. For this end the number, which shall be 
judged requisite to supply vacancies in the standing regiment, might be 
fixed, and that of the students, who are admitted with an expectation 
of filling them, limited accordingly. They might be allowed subsistence 
at tlie public expense. If any other youth desired to pursue the same 
studies at the military academy, they might be admitted ; only subsisting 
themselves. Those students should be instructed in what is usually 
called military discipline, tactics, and the theory and practice of fortifi- 
cation and gunnery. The commandant and one or two other officers of 
the standing regiment, and the engineers, making West Point their 
general residence, would be the masters of the academy ; and the 
inspector-general superintend the whole." — JVtwburg, April '22d, 



1'autIi.] Til i: a m i; luc a n UKVoi.rTio.N. ll!> 

Icr, slioulil ilclay doing tlicin justice, or liazard il in 
pursuit of their Ihvorito object, it might create such 
divisions in ilu- army, as would weaken rather than 
strengthen the iiands of those, who were disposed to 
support Continental measures, and might tend to de- 
feat the end tiiey themselves had in view, by endeav- 
ouring to interest the army. 

For these reasons I said, or meant to say, the army 
was a dangerous engine to work with, as it might be 
made to cut both ways ; antl, considering the sud'erings 
of it, would more than probably throw its weight into 
that scale, which seemed most likely to preponderate 
towards its immediate relief, without looking, under the 
pressure of necessity, to future consequences with the 
eyes of politicians, in tliis light, also, I meant to apply 
my observation to Mr. Morris, to whom, or rather to 
Mr, Gouvcrneur Morris, is ascribed in a great degree 
the groundwork of the superstructure, which was in- 
tended to be raised in the army by the anonymous 
addresser.* 

That no man can be more opposed to State funds or 
local prejudices than myself, the whole tenor of my 
conduct has been one continual evidence of. No man, 
perhaps, has had better opportunities to see and feel 
the pernicious tendency of the latter than I have ; and 
I endeavour (I hope not altogether incnectuall\) to 
inculcate this upon the officers of the army, upon all 
proper occasions ; but their feelings are to be attended 
to and soothed, and they must be assured, that, if 
Continental funds cannot be established, they will be 
recommended to their respective States for payment. 
Justice must be done them. 

I should do injustice to report what I believe to be

the opinion of the army, were I not to inform you, that 
they consider you as a friend, zealous to serve them, 
and one who has espoused their interests in Congress 
upon every proper occasion. It is to be wished, as I 
observed in my letter to Colonel Bland, that Congress 
would send a committee to the army with plenipoten- 
tiary powers. The matters requested of me in youi- 
letter, as chairman of a committee, and many other 
things, might then be brought to a close with more 
despatch and in a happier manner, than it is likely they 
will be by an intercourse of letters at the distance of 
a hundred and fifty miles, which takes our expresses a 
week at least to go and return. At this moment, being 
without any instructions from Congress, I am under 
great embarrassment with respect to the soldiers for 
the war, and shall be obliged more than probably, from 
the necessity of the case, to exercise my own judg- 
ment, without waiting for orders as to the discharge of 
them. If I should adopt measures, which events will 
approve, all will be well ; if otherwise, " Why, and by 
what authority, did you do so ? " 

How far a strong recommendation from Congress to 
observe all the articles of peace as well as the* 

may imply a suspicion of good faith in the peo- 
ple of this country, I pretend not to judge ; but I am 
much mistaken if something of the kind will not be 
found wanting, as I already perceive a disposition to 
carp at and to elude such parts of the treaty, as 
affect different interests, although you do not find a 
man, who, when pushed, will not agree, that, upon the 
whole, it is a more advantageous peace than we could 
possibly have expected. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

TO THK I'RESIDKNT OF CONGRESS. 

Ilcad-Quartors, 18 April, 178a 

Siu, 

I fiiul ii a duly incumbent on mc to communicate to 
your Excellrncy the pre.-^ciit di.sj)o.silion and tamper of 
part of the army. The accounts of peace, wliich liave 
been received at diirerent times, have raised an ex- 
pectation in the mind,-; of the men engaged lor the war, 
that a speetly chscliarge must be the consequence. 
This idea has been so deeply impressed, that it has 
become dillicult to hold them under that sense of 
discipline, which is necessary to bind together the 
subjects ol' an army. The dilatory manner, in which 
the intelligence of peace has arrived to us, has served 
to heighten this idea, and has led those men to some 
suspicion, that official despatches have not been for- 
warded, or ollicial declarations of peace have been 
postponed through design, that they might be held 
beyond the term of their engagements ; by which 
means they have in some instances scarcely been re- 
strained from acts of excess. To such a description 
of men as the army is formed of, this idea is perhaps 
not an unnatural one. 

In this situation the proclamation of Congress for a 
cessation of hostilities found us on its aiTival yesterday. 
This act, being unaccompanied with any instructions for 
my conduct respecting the discharge of this part of the 
army if it should be found necessary, or any intima- 
tions of Congress upon that head, has thrown me into 
a most disagreeable situation. Knowing the temper 
of the men for the war, to suppress the publication 
would increase their suspicions ; and knowing their 
expectations, to publish it to men, who have not learnt 
to distinguish between a proclumatiou for a cessation of 

VOL. VIU. J J 



422 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 51 

hostilities and a definitive declaration of peace, when 
they have authentic information that peace has already 
taken place, would serve to strengthen their ideas of 
immediate discharge, and stamp any claim to their fur- 
ther services with an appearance of injustice. In this 
dilemma, and being totally ignorant of the designs of 
the enemy in New York, who, from all I can collect, are 
making no show of an early evacuation of that city, 
I found it difficult to decide on the line of my duty. 
I therefore called a full council of the general officers 
of the army on the occasion. It was their unani- 
mous judgment, that it would be equally impracticable 
and impolitic to attempt to suppress the proclamation, 
and that it should be issued in this day's orders. At 
the same time, the general officers are deeply impressed 
with an idea of the litde remaining hold, which, after 
this publication, we may expect to have upon the men 
for the loar, and of the absolute necessity there is, that 
Congress should come to some speedy determination 
upon this interesting point, as to what is to be the pe- 
riod of these men's service, and that they should give 
the earliest communication to me of their decision for 
my instruction towards effecting this important object. 
It has been seriously motioned to me, that I should 
hint to Congress the propriety and expediency of their 
appointing a committee of their own body, with plenazy 
powers, who may immediately repair to camp, and Avho 
may decide on the necessary arrangements for this im- 
portant period. For my own part, I am fully in senti- 
ment with this opinion, as such a measure would not 
only tend to quiet our present uneasiness, and help us 
over the difficulty of the moment, but would expedite 
the execution of many other arrangements, which will 
be found necessary, preparatory to our disbanding the 
present army. It might also serve to facilitate any ne-

gotiations, which it may be found expedient to enter 
into with Sir Guy Curlcton, for his speedy evacuation 
of New Yoriv, an object which at present seems at loo 
great a distance for our circumstances. Many other 
matters will undoubtedly present themselves which we 
cannot foresee, and which will occasion fi-ecjuent refer- 
ences to Congress; and, as much time is lost in com- 
munications between the army and that sovereign body, 
a committee on the spot, who might give immediate 
decision, would be of great importance, and perhaps 
suppress many disagreeable consequences which might 
arise merely from delay. One circumstance has already 
occurred, as Congress will perceive by the enclosed 
petition from the troops of the Now .Jersey line ; anoth- 
er I have this day heard of in the Connecticut Hne, ex- 
tending to a claim of half-pay or commutation for the 
non-commissioned officers of that line. How far their 
ideas, if not suppressed by some lucky expedient, may 
proceed, it is beyond my power to divine. 

Notwithstanding the length of this letter, I must beg 
the liberty to suggest to Congress an idea, which has 
been hinted to me, and which has afTectcd my mind 
very forciljly. That is, that, at the discharge of the men 
for the war. Congress should suder those men, non- 
commissioned officers and soldiers, to take with them 
as their own property, and as a gratuity, the arms and 
accoutrements they now hold. This act would raise 
pleasing sensations in the minds of those worthy and 
faithful men, who, from their early engaging in the 
war at moderate bounties, and from their patient con- 
tinuance under innumerable distresses, have not only 
deserved nobly of their country, but have obtained an 
honorable distinction over those, who, with shorter 
times, have gained large pecuniary rewards. This, at 
a comparatively small expense, would be deemed an

honorable testimonial from Congress of the regard they 
bear to those distinguished worthies, and the sense they 
have had of their suliering virtues and services, which 
have been so happily instrumental towards the establish- 
ment and the security of the rights, liberties, and inde- 
pendence of this rising empire. These constant com- 
panions of their toils, preserved with sacred attention, 
would be handed down from the present possessors to 
their children, as honorary badges of bravery and mili- 
tary merit ; and would probably be brought forth, on 
some future occasion, with pride and exultation, to be 
hnproved with the same military ardor and emulation 
m the hands of posterity, as they have been used by 
then- forefathers in the present establishment and foun- 
dation of oiu" national independence and glory. 

Congress will suffer me to repeat my most earnest 
wish, that they will be pleased, either by themselves at 
large, or by their committee, to pay the earliest atten- 
tion to the matters now referred to their consideration ; 
for I can only add, that, unless the most speedy ar- 
rangements for the war men are adopted, I contemplate 
with anxiety the disagreeable consequences, which, I 
fear, will be the result of much longer delay. 

I have the honor to be, &c.* 

* This letter was referred to a committee, in conformity with whose 
report, it was resolved, that, in the opinion of Congress, the time of ser- 
vice of the men engaged for the war did not expire till the ratification 
of the definitive articles of peace ; that those continning in the service 
till that time should be allowed their arms and accoutrements ; but that, 
nevertlieless, discretion should be left with the Commander-in-cliief to 
grant furloughs, or discliarges, to those men, as he should judge most 
expedient. — Journals, .Ipril 23tl.

TO SIK GUY CAKLETOX. 

llead-Quartors, 21 AprU, 178a 

Sir, 

I have the satisfaction of enclosing to your Excel- 
lency a proclaiiialiuii, which I have received from the 
sovereign power of the United States, ordering a gen- 
eral cessation of hostilities, as well by sea as land, with 
directions that the same should he published to all their 
subjects under my commtmd. In compliance with these 
instructions, the same was made public in the American 
cam[) on the 19th, \\ith my orders that it should be 
made known at all the out-posts of the American army 
as soon as possible.* 

In consequence of this declaration, and in conformity 
to the articles of the treaty, Congress have been pleased 
to pass their resolutions of the 15th instant, directing 
arrangements to be formed for the liberation of all 
prisoners, and other purposes, which your Excellency 
will collect from the enclosed copy, which I transmit 
for your observation. 

In a conference, which 1 had yesterday with the 
minister at war, agreeably to the terms of the abovc- 

Uie proper measures for conducting those troops to tlioir respective 
homes, in such a manner as may be most convenient to themselves and 
to the States through which they may pass ; and that the men thus fur- 
loughcd be allowed to take their arms with them." — May 'Xth. 

* The proclamation for a cessation of hostilities was agreed upon 
and adopted in Congress on tlio lllh of April. It is observable, tliat 
it v/as published in camp precisely eight years from the date of tlio 
first act of hostility at Lexington. General Heath describes tJie ceremo- 
ny as follows. 

" Jlpril Wth. At noon the proclamation of Congress for a cessation of 
hostilities was proclaimed at the door of the New Building, followed 
by three huzzas ; after which a prayer was made by the Reverend

by vocal and instrumental music." — Memoirs, p. ."(71. The general or-

mentioned resolutions, it has been agreed between us, 
that the land prisoners should be liberated as soon as 
possible, and that orders should be immediately given 
for commencing their march towards New York. But 
as their situation, by being removed to the interior of 
the countiy, is far distant from New York, which will 
make their march disagreeable and long, we have 
agreed to submit it to your option, whether to have 
them marched the whole distance through the country, 
or to have them delivered at the nearest water, where 
it may be convenient for your ships to receive them. 
Should you choose the latter, the following arrangement 
has been determined. The prisoners, who are lodged 
at Fredericktown and Winchester, in the States of 
Virginia and Maryland, in number about fifteen hun- 
dred, including women and children, will begin their 
march on the route towards Baltimore, where they 
may arrive on the 10th of May; at which time, should 
your ships be ready to receive them there, they may 
be embarked, and proceed to New York. If ships are 
not directed to receive them at the time mentioned at 
Baltimore, they will proceed by land to the Delaware. 
The remainder of the prisoners, being in Pennsyl- 
vania, amounting to about four thousand five hundred, 
may all (except those at Reading, between three and 
four hundred,) be embarked at Philadelphia, and also 
those from Fredericktown and Winchester, should they 
not be received at Baltimore, provided your ships 
are there by the 5th of May at farthest. Should ships 
not be ordered by your Excellency to take them by 
water, they will be marched in convenient detachments, 
of about five hundred each, through the country to 
Elizabethtown, with all convenient expedition. In any 
case, those from Reading, being in the upper part of 
Pennsylvania, will march directly to Elizabethtown.

It is also suliniittcd lo your option to .send or nut, 
as you sliall think proper, an additional number of ofli- 
cers to attend tlic march of the prisoners through the 
coimtry, and to prevent any iiregularities that (H.sor- 
deriy persons may he disposctl to commit. 

In either alternative respecting the receipt ol" tlie 
prisoners, you will be pleased to give the earliest infor- 
malion, to the minister at war in Philadelphia, of your 
determinations, that he may be able to make the neces- 
sary and timely dispositions to pay all proper attention 
to your choice. To expedite this purpose, and for llie 
convenience of transportation, I enclose a passport for 
such odicers as you shall think proper to charge with 
your despatches on this occasion. 

Respecting the other subjects contained in the i n- 
closed resolution of Congress, as they may be discussed 
with more precision and despatch by a personal inter- 
view between your E.xcellency and myself, at some 
convenient time and intermediate place, such as may 
be agreed upon between your Excellency and Colonel 
Humphreys, my aid-de-camp, who will have the hon- 
or to deliver this letter, I would only suggest, that, in 
point of time, the earliest day you can name will be 
most agreeable to me. Should an interview be con- 
sented to on your part, the governor of this State, 
being particularly interested in any arrangements, which 
respect the restitution of the post of New York, will 
attend me on this occasion. I am, &,c.*

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 3 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I take the liberty to mention to your Excellency, 
that, in attending to the resolutions of Congress of the 
1.5th of April, respecting the posts in the United States 
occupied by the British troops, I find it necessary to 
apply for some more particular explanation of the in- 
tentions of Congress than is there expressed.* 

Taking it for granted, that the northern and western 
posts are included within the ideas of Congress, as 
well as New York, arrangements for receiving posses- 
sion of those posts are to be made with General Hal- 
dimand, who commands in the district of Canada. As 
our communication will be distant and take much time, 
previous to commencing this coirespondence it will be 
necessary that I should be as fully instructed as cir- 
cumstances will admit, as to the intentions of Congress 
respecting these frontier posts ; particularly what foot- 
ing they will determine to place them upon in their 
peace estabhshment, and what number of men shall be 
sent to maintain them. Congress will also be impress- 
ed with the necessity of adopting the earliest measures 

decline the personal interview proposed by your Excellency, and purpose 
being in a frigate as near Tappan as may be, where I understand you 
mean to lodge. If I bear nothing from you to occasion an alteration, 1 
intend being up, on the 5th of May, accompanied by a smaller vessel or 
two, for the accommodation of Lieutenant-Governor Elliot, Chief Justice 
William Smith, and part of my family." — JVew York, ,/lpril U4th. 

* By a resolve of the 15th of April, the Commander-in-chief was in- 
Ftructed to make arrangements with the British commander for receiving 
possession of the posts held by the British troops in the United States, 
and for obtaining the delivery of all negroes and other property, which 
by the treaty were to be given up. It was also resolved, that the secre- 
tary at war, in conjunction with the Commander-in-chief, should concert 
measures for liberating all the land prisoners. They had recently met 
at Ringwood for this purpose.

possible for procuiinj^ the nu-ii, u lio will be necessary 
lor garrisoning the forts. Wliether this shall be ef- 
fected by detaching the three years' men of the pres- 
ent army, or raising them in some other manner, will 
be also to be detennined. 

The posts should certainly be occupied by United 
States troops the moment they are evacuated by the 
British. Should this be neglected, I have my fears, 
that they may be burned or destroyed by the Indians, 
or some other evil-mindeil persons, whose disallt'ction 
to the government of the United States may lead them 
to such enormities. 

Arrangements for transporting the necessary artillery, 
stores, amnumitioii, and provisions, will take time, and 
will need immediate attention. The season for doing 
this is now at hand ; and if suffered to pass off, it will 
be exceedingly dilUcult if not impracticable to effect 
their transportation, particularly through the small wa- 
ter communications, which at the present season will 
be found very convenient, but which the summer heats 
will render so low, as to become almost impassable. 

Persuaded that Congress will view these subjects 
in the same important light that I do, I promise my- 
self that I shall I)c favored with their instructions at 
the earliest moment possible. I am, &,c. 



TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Orangetown, 6 May, 1783. 



Sir, 

In my letter of the 21st of April, I enclosed to your 
Excellency a copy of a resolution of Congress of the 
15th, instnicUng me in three points, which appeared 
necessary for carrying into effect the terms of the 



430 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mt. 51. 



treaty between Great Britain and the United States 
of America ; and I informed you, that such part as 
rested upon my decision, and which regarded the re- 
lease of prisoners, had been determined, and was then 
ordered to be carried into execution. Upon the other 
two points, as they respected the receiving possession 
of the posts in occupation of the British troops, and 
the carrying away any negroes or other property of the 
American inhabitants, and both being within your con- 
trol, I had the honor to propose a personal interview 
with your Excellency, that the subject might be freely 
discussed, and that measures might be agreed upon, 
for carrying into execution those points of the seventh 
article of the treaty, agreeably to their true intent and 
spirit. 

Having been favored this day with a personal con- 
ference, I have now, to prevent misapprehension or 
misconstruction, and that I may be enabled to fulfil my 
instructions with fidelity and with candor, the honor to 
propose, agreeably to our conversation, that your Ex- 
cellency will be pleased to give me in writing informa- 
tion as to what measures are adopting, on your part, 
for carrying into execution that point of the treaty, 
which regards the evacuation of the posts now in pos- 
session of the Bridsh troops and under 3'our Excel- 
lency's command ; and also at what time it is proba- 
ble those posts, or any of them, may be relinquished, 
and the fleets and armies of his Britannic Majesty 
withdrawn. 

Respecting the other point of discussion, in addition 
to what I mentioned in my communicadon of the 21st 
ultimo, I took occasion in our conference to inform 
your Excellency, that, in consequence of your letter 
of the 14th of April to Robert R. Livingston, Esquire, 
Congress had been pleased to make a further reference

to me of tliat li'tttT, and had directed me to take sucii 
measures as shoultl be found necessary lor carrying 
into ell'ect the several matters mentioned by you there- 
in.* Ill tlie course of our conversation on this point, 
I was surprised to hear you mention, that an embarlia- 
tion had already taken place, in which a large number 
of negroes had been canietl away. Whether this con- 
duct is consonant to, or how far it may be deemed an 
mfraction of the treaty, is not for me to decide. I 
cannot, however, conceal from you, that my private 
opinion is, that the measure is totally dilFerent from the 
letter and spirit of the treaty. But, waving the discus- 
sion of the point, and leaving its decision to our re- 
spective sovereigns, I find it my duty to signify my 
readiness, in conjunction with your Excellency, to en- 
ter into any agreement, or to take any measures, which 
may be deemed expedient, to prevent the future car- 
rying away of any negroes, or other property of the 

* In the letter here mentioned, Sir Guy Carleton had requested, tliat 
Congress would empower some person or persons to go into New York, 
and assist such persons as he should appoint to inspect and superintend 
the embarkation of persons and property, in fullilment of Uie seventh 
article of the provisional treaty, and " that they would be pleased to re- 
present to him every infraction of tlie letter or spirit of the treaty, that 
redress might be immediately ordered." — Diplomatic Corrtspondence, 
Vol. XI. p. 3.3.5. The commissioners appointed by General Washington 
for this purpose were Egbert Benson, William S. Smith, and Daniel Par- 
ker. Their instructions were dated the 8th of May. 

Soon after the commissioners arrived in New York, General Washing- 
ton sent to Colonel Smith a list of the titles of books, which he had se- 
lected from a catalogue published by a bookseller in a gazette, and which 
he requested Colonel Smith to purchase for him. The reader may be 
curious to know the kind of works to which his thniigliLs were at this 
time directed. Thoy were tlie following. Life of Charles the Twelfth ; 
Life of Louis the Fifleentli ; Life and Reign of Peter the Great ; Rob- 
ertson's History of America ; Voltaire's Letters ; Vcrtot's Revolution of 
Rome, and Revolution of Portugal; Life of (Jiistavus .'Vdolphus ; Sully's

TO THE DUKE DE LAUZUN. 

Head-Quarters, 10 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I had not the honor of receiving your favor of the 
1st instant until the 7th. Being at that time at Orange- 
town on a conference with Sir Guy Carleton, it had a 
circuitous route to make before it reached me. This 
circumstance you will be so good as to admit as an 
apology for my not giving an earlier reply. 

I have now the honor to mention to you, as I did 
some time ago to the minister of France, that, viewing 
the peace so near a final conclusion, I could not hold 
myself justified in a desire to detain the troops under 
your command from the expectations of their sove- 
reign, or to prevent their own wishes of a return to 
their native country and friends. 

Nor can I omit, on this occasion, to express to you, 
Sir, and to all the brave officers and soldiers of your 
corps, the high esteem I have for them, and the re- 
gard I shall ever entertain for their services in the 
cause of the United States, to whose independence 
and establishment as a nation they have contributed a 
noble share. 

Your particular services. Sir, with the politeness, 
zeal, and attention, which I have ever experienced 
from you, have made a deep and lasting impression on 
my mind, and will serve to endear you to my remem- 
brance. It would have been a great satisfaction to me

to have hail further o[)portuiiity lo give you, in per-

But my regret at parting with you will be somewhat 
softened by the flattering hope you are pleased lo 
give me, that I may have the satisfaction of emi)racing 
you again in America ; where you may be assured I 
shall ever most sincerely rejoice in an opportunity of

the happiness to be connected in service through the

the preservation and establishment of the rights, Uber- 
ties, and independence of our country. 

Your congratulations on the happy prospects of our 
peace and independent security, with their attendant 
blessings to the United States, I receive with great sat- 
isfaction ; and beg that you w'ill accept a return of my 
gratulations to you on this auspicious event ; an event, 
in which, great as it is in itself, and glorious as it will 
probably be in its consequences, you have a right to 
participate largely, from the disUnguished part you have 
contributed towards its attainment. 

But while I contemplate the greatness of the object 
for w^hich we have contended, and felicitate you on the 
happy issue of our toils and labors, which have termi- 
nated with such general satisfaction, I lament that you 
should feel the ungrateful returns of a country, in whose 
service you have exhausted your bodily health, and ex- 
pended the vigor of a youthful constitution. I wish, 
however, that your expectations of returning sentiments 
of liberality may be verified. I have a hope, that they 
may ; but, should they not, your case will not be a sin- 
gular one. Ingratitude has been experienced in all 
ages, and republics in particular have ever been famed 
for the exercise of that unnatural and sordid vice. 

The secretary at war, who is now here, informs me 
that you have been considered as entitled to full pay 
since your absence from the field ; and that you will be 
still considered in that Hght till the close of the war, 
at which period you will be equally entitled to the same 
emoluments of half-pay or commutation as other offi- 
cers of your rank. The same opinion is also given by 
the paymaster-general, who is now with the army, em- 
powered by Mr. Morris for the settlement of all their 
accounts, and who will attend to yours whenever you 
shall think proper to send on for the purpose ; which 
it wdll probably be best for you to do in a short time.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Head-Quarters, G June, 1783. 

Sir, 
Before I make a reply to the subject of the address 
of the generals and officers, commanding the regiments 
and corps of this army, presented by yourself yester- 
day, I entreat that those gentlemen will accept my 
warmest acknowledgment for the confidence they have 
been pleased to repose in me. They may be assured 
it shall never be abused ; and I beg they will be per- 
suaded, that, as no man can possibly be better ac- 
quainted than I am wiih the past merits and services 
of the army, so no one can possibly be more strongly 
impressed with their present ineligible situation, feel a 
keener sensibility at their distresses, or more ardently 
desire to alleviate or remove them. But it would be

unnecessary, perhaps, to enter into a detail of what I 
have done, and what I am still attempting to do, in or- 
der to assist in the accomplishment of this interesting 
purpose. Let it be suflicient to observe, that I do not 
yet despair of success ; for I am perfectly convinced 
that the States cannot, without involving themselves in 
national bankruptcy and ruin, refuse to comply with the 
requisitions of Congress; who, it must be acknowl- 
edged, have done every thing in their power to obtain 
ample and complete justice for the army ; and whose 
great object in the present measure undoubtedly was, 
by a reduction of expense, to enable the financier to 
make the three months' payment to the army, which 
on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely and in- 
dispensably necessary. To explain this matter, I beg 
leave to insert an extract of a letter from the super- 
mtendent of finance, dated the 29th ultimo. 

" It is now a month since the committee conferred 
with me on that subject, and I then told them no pay- 
ment could be made to the army, but by means of a 
paper anticipation ; and, unless our expenditures were 
immediately and considerably reduced, even that could 
not be done. Our expenditures have nevertheless been 
continued, and our revenues lessen, the States growing 
daily more and more remiss in their collections. The 
consequence is, that I cannot make payment in the 
manner first intended. The notes issued for this pm'- 
pose would have been payable at two, four, and six 
months from the date, but at present they will be at 
six months, and even that will soon become impractica- 
ble, unless our expenses be immediately curtailed. 

" I shall cause such notes to be issued for three 
months' pay to the army ; and I must entreat. Sir, that 
every influence be used with the States to absorb them, 
together with my other engagements, by taxation."

riuuc days ago, a inossfiigcr was despatched by me 
ti) urge the necessity ot" lorwai-iling these notes with 
the greatest possible expedition. Under this stale of 
circumstances, I need scarcely acUi, that tl\e ex[)ense 
of every day, in feeding tlie whole army, will increase 
very consitkrably the inability of the public to discharge 
the debts already incurred, at least for a considerable 
time to come. Although (Ik,' olliccrs of the army very 
well know my ollicial situation, that I am only a servant 
of the public, and that it is not for me to dispense 
with onlcrs, which it is my duty to carry into execu- 
tion ; yet, as furloughs in all services are considered as 
a matter of indulgence, and not of compulsion ; as 
Congress, I am persuaded, entertain the best disposi- 
tion towards the army ; and as I apprehend in a very 
short time the two principal articles of complaint will be 
removed ; 1 shall not hesitate to comply with the wishes 
of the army, under these reservations only, that oflicers 
suflicient to conduct the men, who choose to receive 
furloughs, will attend them, either on furlough or by 
detachment. The propriety and necessity of this meas- 
ure must be obvious to all ; it need not, therefore, be 
enforced ; and, with regard to the non-commissioned 
officers and privates, such, as from a peculiarity of cir- 
cumstances wish not to receive furloughs at this time, 
will give in their names by twelve o'clock to-morrow 
to the commanding officers of their regiments, that, on 
a report to the adjutant-general, an equal number of 
men, engaged for three years, may be furloughed, which 
will make the saving of expenses exactly the same to 
the pubhc. 

I cannot but hope the notes will soon arrive, and 
that the settlement of accounts may be completed, by 
the assistance of the paymasters, in a very few days. 
In the mean time, I shall have the honor of laying the

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 7 June, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency the 
copy of an address to me, from the generals and of- 
ficers commanding regiments and corps, together with 
my answer to it. These enclosures will explain the 
distresses, which resulted from the measures now car- 
rying into execution, in consequence of the resolution 
of the 26th of May ; but the sensibility occasioned by 
a parting scene under such peculiar cii-cumstances will 
not admit of description. 

The two subjects of complaint with the army ap- 
pear to be, the delay of the three months' payment, 
which had been expected, and the want of a setde- 
ment of accounts. I have thought myself authorized 
to assure them, that Congress had attended and would 
attend particularly to their grievances, and have made 
some little variations respecting furloughs from what 
was at first proposed. The secretary at war will be 
able to explain the reason and propriety of this alteration. 

While I consider it a tribute of justice on this oc- 
casion, to mention the temperate and orderly behaviour 
of the whole army, and particularly the accommodating 
spirit of the officers in arranging themselves to the 
command of the battaUons, which will be composed 
of the three years' men, permit me to recall to mind

ALL THE STATES O.V IMSUANDI.NU THE AK.MY. 

Head-Quarters, Ncwburg, 8 June, 17e3. 

Sir, 
The great object, for which I had the honor to hold 
an appointment in the service of my country, being 
accomplishcii, I am now preparing to resign it into the 
hiuuls of Congress, and to return to that domestic re- 
tirement, which, it is well known, I left with the great- 
est reluctance; a retirement for which I have never 
ceased to sigh, through a long and painful absence, and 
in which (remote from the noise and trouble of the 
world) I meditate to pass the remainder of life, in a 
state of undisturbed repose. But before I carry this 
resolution into eHVct, I think it a duty incumbent on 
me to make this my last ollicial communication ; to 
congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven 
has been pleased to produce in our favor ; to oder my 
sentiments respecting some important sul)jects, which 
appear to me to be intimately connected with the tran- 
quillity of the United States ; to take my leave of your 
Excellency as a public character ; anil to give my final 
blessing to that country, in whose service I have spent 
the prime of my life, for whose sake I have consumed

SO many anxious days and watchful nights, and whose 
happiness, being extremely dear to me, will always 
constitute no inconsiderable part of my own. 

Impressed with the liveliest sensibility on this pleas- 
ing occasion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the 
more copiously on the subjects of our mutual fehcita- 
tion. When we consider the magnitude of the prize 
we contended for, the doubtful nature of the contest, 
and tlie favorable manner in which it has terminated, 
we shall find the greatest possible reason for gratitude 
and rejoicing. This is a theme that will afford infinite 
delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether 
the event in contemplation be considered as the source 
of present enjoyment or the parent of future happi- 
ness ; and we shall have equal occasion to felicitate 
ourselves on the lot which Providence has assigned us, 
whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral 
point of light. 

The citizens of America, placed in the most enviable 
condition, as the sole lords and proprietors of a vast 
tract of continent, comprehending all the various soils 
and climates of the world, and abounding with all the 
necessaries and conveniences of life, are now, by the 
late satisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be pos- 
sessed of absolute freedom and independency. They 
are, from this period, to be considered as the actors 
on a most conspicuous theatre, which seems to be pe- 
culiarly designated by Providence for the display of hu- 
man greatness and felicity. Here they are not only 
surrounded with every thing, which can contribute to 
the completion of private and domestic enjoyment ; but 
Heaven has crowned all its other blessings, by giving 
a fairer opportunity for political happiness, than any 
other nation has ever been favored with. Nothing can 
illustrate these observations more forcibly, than a rec-

ollcction oF the happy conjuncture of times and circum- 
stances, under which our republic assumed its rank 
among the nations. The foundation of our empire was 
not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and supersti- 
tion ; but at im epocha wlicn Uie rigiits of mankind were 
better understood and more cleaily defmed, than at 
any former period. The researches of the human mind 
after social happiness have been carried to a great 
extent ; the treasures of knowledge, acquired by the 
labors of philosophers, sages, and legislators, through 
a long succession of years, are laid open for our use, 
and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in 
the establishment of our forms of government. The 
free cultivation of letters, the unbounded extension of 
commerce, the progressive refinement of manners, the 
growing liberality of sentiment, and, above all, the pure 
and benign light of Revelation, have had a meliorating 
inlluence on mankind and increased the blessings of 
society. At this auspicious period, the United States 
came into existence as a nation ; and, if their citizens 
should not be completely free and happy, the fault will 
be entirely their own. 

Such is our situation, and such are our prospects ; 
but, notwithstanding the cup of blessing is thus reached 
out to us ; notwithstanding happiness is ours, if we 
have a disposition to seize the occasion and make it our 
own ; yet it appears to me there is an option still left 
to the United States of America, that it is in their 
choice, and depends upon their conduct, whether they 
will be respectable and prosperous, or contemptible and 
miserable, as a nation. This is the time of their political 
probation ; this is the moment when the eyes of the 
whole world are turned upon them ; this is the moment 
to establish or ruin their national character for ever; 
this is the favorable moment to give such a tone to our 

VOL. vtit. .56 



442 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

federal government, as will enable it to answer the ends 
of its institution, or this may be the ill-fated moment for 
relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the ce- 
ment of the confederation, and exposing us to become 
the sport of European politics, which may play one 
State against another, to prevent their growing im- 
portance, and to serve their own interested purposes. 
For, according to the system of policy the States shall 
adopt at this moment, they will stand or fall ; and by 
their confirmation or lapse it is yet to be decided, 
whether the revolution must ultimately be considered 
as a blessing or a curse ; a blessing or a curse, not to 
the present age alone, for with om* fate will the destiny 
of unborn millions be involved. 

With this conviction of the importance of the present 
crisis, silence in me would be a crime. I will therefore 
speak to your Excellency the language of freedom and 
of sincerity without disguise. I am aware, however, 
that those who differ from me in political sentiment, may 
perhaps remark, that I am stepping out of the proper line 
of my duty, and may possibly ascribe to arrogance or 
ostentation, what I know is alone the result of the purest 
intention. But the rectitude of my own heart, which 
disdains such unworthy motives ; the part I have hither- 
to acted in life ; the determination I have formed, of not 
taking any share in public business hereafter ; the ar- 
dent desire I feel, and shall continue to manifest, of 
quietly enjoying, in private life, after all the toils of 
Avar, the benefits of a wise and Hberal government, 
will, I flatter myself, sooner or later convince my 
countrymen, that I could have no sinister views in 
delivering, with so little reserve, the opinions contain- 
ed in this address. 

There are four things, which, I humbly conceive, are 
essential to the well-being, I may even ventui-e to say, to 



I'AHill.) Illi: AMKRICAN RKVOLUTION. 443 

the existence of the United States, as an independent 
power. 

First. An indissoluble union of the States under one 
federal head. 

Second. A sacred regard to public justice. 

Thinl. The adoption of a proper peace establish- 
ment ; and, 

Fourth. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly 
disposition among the people of the United States, 
which will induce them to forget their local prejudices 
and policies ; to make those mutual concessions, which 
aj-e requisite to the general prosperity ; and, in some 
instances, to sacrifice their individual advantages to 
the interest of the community. 

These are the pillars on which the glorious fabric 
of our independency and national character must be 
supported. Liberty is the basis ; and whoever would 
dare to sap the foundadon, or overturn the structure, 
under whatever specious pretext he may attempt it, 
will merit the bitterest execration, and the severest 
punishment, which can be inllicted by his injured 
country. 

On the three first articles I will make a few ob- 
servations, leaving the last to the good sense and seri- 
ous consideration of those immediately concerned. 

Under the first head, although it may not be neces- 
sary or proper for me, in this place, to enter into a par- 
ticular disquisition on the principles of the Union, and 
to take up the great question which has been frequently 
agitated, whether it be expedient and requisite for the 
States to delegate a larger proportion of power to Con- 
gress, or not ; yet it will be a part of my duty, and 
that of every true patriot, to assert without reserve, 
and to insist upon, the following positions. That, un- 
less the States will suffer Congress to exercise those 



444 WASIHNCiTON'S WRITINGS. [.«t. 51. 

prerogatives they are undoubtedly invested with by the 
constitution, every thing must very rapidly tend to an- 
archy and confusion. That it is indispensable to the 
happiness of the individual States, that there should be 
lodged somewhere a supreme power to regulate and 
govern the general concerns of the confederated repub- 
lic, without which the Union cannot be of long duration. 
That there must be a faithful and pointed compliance, 
on the part of every State, with the late proposals and 
demands of Congress, or the most fatal consequences 
will ensue. That whatever measures have a tendency 
to dissolve the Union, or contribute to violate or lessen 
the sovereign authority, ought to be considered as hos- 
tile to the liberty and independency of America, and the 
authors of them treated accordingly. And lastly, that 
unless we can be enabled, by the concurrence of the 
States, to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and 
enjoy the essential benefits of civil society, under a form 
of government so free and uncorrupted, so happily 
guai'ded against the danger of oppression, as has been 
devised and adopted by the ardcles of confederation, it 
will be a subject of regret, that so much blood and 
treasure have been lavished for no purpose, that so 
many sufferings have been encountered without a com- 
pensation, and that so many sacrifices have been made 
in vain. 

Many other consideradons might here be adduced 
to prove, that, without an entire conformity to the spirit 
of the Union, we cannot exist as an independent power. 
It will be sufficient for my purpose to mention but one 
or two, which seem to me of the greatest importance. 
It is only in our united character, as an empire, that oui- 
independence is acknowledged, that our power can be 
regarded, or our credit supported, among foreign na- 
tions. The treaties of the European powers with the 



I'artHI Til K AMERICAN REVOM'I' I on. 445 

United States ol" Amcricii will liuvc no validity on a 
dissolution of the Union. We sliall he left nearly in a 
state ot' nature ; or we may find, hy our own unhappy 
experience, tliat there is a natural and necessary pro- 
gression from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme 
of tyranny, antl that arhitrary power is most easily 
established on the ruins of liberty, abused to licentious- 
ness. 

As to the second article, which respects the perform- 
ance of public justice. Congress liave, in their late 
address to the United States, almost exhausted the 
subject ; they have explained their ideas so fully, and 
have enforced the obligations the States ai'e under, to 
render complete justice to all the public creditors, with 
so much dignity and energy, that, in my opinion, no real 
friend of the honor and independency of America can 
hesitate a single moment, respecting the propriety of 
complybg with the just and honorable measures pro- 
posed. If their arguments do not produce conviction, 
I know of nothing that will have greater influence ; 
especially when we recollect, that the system referred 
to, being the result of the collected wisdom of the con- 
tinent, must be esteemed, if not perfect, certainly the 
least objectionable of any that could be devised ; and 
that, if it shall not be carried into immediate execution, 
a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable consequen- 
ces, will take place, before any difierent plan can possi- 
bly be proposed and adopted. So pressing are the 
present circumstances, and such is the alternative now 
oflTered to the States. 

The ability of the country to discharge the debts, 
which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be 
doubted ; an inclination, I flatter myself, w ill not be 
wanting. The path of our duty is plain before us ; hon- 
esty will be found, on every experiment, to be the best 

VOL. VIII. LL

and only true policy. Let us then, as a nation, be just ; 
let us fulfil the public contracts, which Congress had 
undoubtedly a right to make for the purpose of carrying 
on the war, with the same good faith we suppose our- 
selves bound to perform our private engagements. In 
the mean time, let an attention to the cheerful perform- 
ance of their proper business, as individuals and as 
members of society, be earnestly inculcated on the 
citizens of America ; then will they strengthen the 
hands of government, and be happy under its pro- 
tection ; every one will reap the fruit of his labors, 
every one will enjoy his own acquisitions, without 
molestation and without danger. 

In this state of absolute freedom and perfect se- 
curity, who will grudge to yield a very little of his 
property to support the common interest of society, 
and insure the protection of government? Who does 
not remember the frequent declarations, at the com- 
mencement of the war, that Ave should be completely 
satisfied, if, at the expense of one half, we could de- 
fend the remainder of our possessions ? Where is 
the man to be found, who wishes to remain indebted 
for the defence of his own person and property to 
the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, 
without making one generous effort to repay the debt 
of honor and of gratitude 1 In what part of the con- 
tinent shall we find any man, or body of men, who 
would not blush to stand up and propose measures, 
purposely calculated to rob the soldier of his stipend, 
and the public creditor of his due ? And were it 
possible, that such a flagrant instance of injustice 
could ever happen, would it not excite the general 
indignation, and tend to bring down upon the authors 
of such measures the aggravated vengeance of Heaven ? 
If, after all, a spirit of disunion, or a temper of obstinacy

and pen-crscness should manitl'st itself in any of the 
States ; if such an un;i;racious disposition should attempt 
to frustrate all the happy eflects that might be expected 
to How from the Union ; if there should be a refusal to 
comply with the requisitions for funds to discharge the 
•annual interest of the \ni\)\\c debts; and if that refusal 
should revive again all those jealousies, and produce 
all tliose evils, which ai-e now happily removed, Con- 
gress, who have, in all their transactions, shown a great 
degree of magnanimity and justice, will stand justified 
in the sight of God and man ; and that State alone, 
which puts itself in opposition to the aggregate wisdom 
of the continent, and follows such mistaken and per- 
nicious counsels, will be responsible for all the con- 
sequences. 

For my own part, conscious of having acted, while 
a servant of the public, in the manner I conceived best 
suited to promote the real interests of my country ; 
having, in consequence of my lixed belief, in some 
measure pledged myself to the army, that their coun- 
try would finally do them complete and ample justice ; 
and not wishing to conceal any instance of my oflicial 
conduct from the eyes of the vvoild, I have thought 
proper to transmit to your Excellency the enclosed col- 
lection of papers, relative to the half-pay and commu- 
tation granted by Congress to the olFicers of the ai-my. 
From these communications, my decided sentiments 
will be clearly comprehended, together with the con- 
clusive reasons which induced me, at an early period, 
to recommend the adoption of the measure, in the 
most earnest and serious manner. As the proceed- 
ings of Congress, the army, and myself, are open to all, 
and contain, in mv opinion, sufTicient information to re- 
move the prejudices and errors, which may have been 
entertained by any, I think it unnecessary to say any 



448 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 51. 



thing more than just to observe, that the resolutions 
of Congress, now alluded to, are undoubtedly as ab- 
solutely binding upon the United States, as the most 
solemn acts of confederation or legislation. 

As to the idea, -which, I am informed, has in some 
instances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation 
are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pen- 
sion, it ought to be exploded for ever. That provision 
should be viewed, as it really was, a reasonable com- 
pensation offered by Congress, at a time A\hen they 
had nothing else to give to the officers of the army for 
services then to be performed. It was the only means 
to prevent a total dereliction of the service. It was a 
part of their hire. I may be allowed to say, it was the 
price of their blood, and of your independency ; it is 
therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of 
honor ; it can never be considered as a pension or gra- 
tuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly discharged. 

With regard to a distinction between officers and 
soldiers, it is sufficient that the uniform experience of 
every nation of the world, combined with our own, 
proves the utihty and propriety of the discrimination. 
Rewards, in proportion to the aids which the public 
derives from them, are unquestionably due to all its 
servants. In some lines, the soldiers have perhaps 
generally had as ample compensation for their services, 
by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as 
their officers will receive in the proposed commutation ; 
in others, if, besides the donation of lands, the payment 
of arrearages of clothing and wages (in which articles 
all the component parts of the army must be put upon 
the same footing), we take into the estimate the bounties 
many of the soldiers have received, and the gratuity 
of one year's full pay, which is promised to aU, possibly 
their situation (every circumstance being duly consid- 



1'aki 11] TlIK AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1 !'.> 

ered) will not be deemed less eligible than that of the 
oflict-rs. ShoiiKl a iiiither reward, however, be judged 
equitable, I will venture to assert, no one will enjoy 
greater satisfaction than myself, on seeing an exemp- 
tion from taxes for a limited time, (which has been 
petitioned for in some instances,) or any other ade- 
quate immunity or compensation granted to the brave 
defentlers of their country's cause ; but neither the 
adoption nor rejection of this proposition will in any 
manner allect, much less militate against, the act of 
Congress, by which they have offered five years' full 
pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been 
before promised to the otlicers of the army. 

Before I conclude the subject of public justice, I 
cannot omit to mention the obligations this country 
is under to that meritorious class of veteran non- 
commissioned officers and privates, who have been 
discharged for inability, in consequence of the resolu- 
tion of Congress of the 23d of April, 178-2, on an 
annual pension for life. Their peculiar sufferings, their 
singular merits, and claims to that provision, need only 
be known, to interest all the feelings of humanity in 
their behalf. Nothing but a punctual payment of their 
annual allowance can rescue them from the most com- 
plicated misery ; and nothing could be a more melan- 
choly and distressing sight, than to behold those, who 
have shed their blood or lost their limbs in the service 
of their country, without a shelter, without a friend, 
and without the means of obtaining any of the neces- 
saries or comforts of life, compelled to beg their daily 
bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend 
those of thistlescription, belonging to your State, to the 
warmest patronage of your Excellency and your legis- 
lature. 

It is necessary to say but a few words on the third 

vol.. VIII. 57 LL • 



450 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 51. 

topic which was proposed, and which regards particu- 
larly the defence of the republic ; as there can be little 
doubt that Congress will recommend a proper peace 
establishment for the United States, in which a due 
attention will be paid to the importance of placing the 
militia of the Union upon a regular and respectable 
footing. If this should be the case, I would beg leave 
to urge the great advantage of it in the strongest terms. 
The militia of this country must be considered as the 
palladium of our security, and the first efiectual resort 
in case of hostility. It is essential, therefore, that the 
same system should pervade the whole ; that the for- 
mation and discipline of the militia of the continent 
should be absolutely uniform, and that the same spe- 
cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, 
should be introduced in every part of the United 
States. No one, who has not learned it from ex- 
perience, can conceive the difficulty, expense, and 
confusion, which result from a contrary system, or 
the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed. 
If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude 
than usual has been taken in the course of this ad- 
dress, the importance of the crisis, and the magnitude 
of the objects in discussion, must be my apology. It 
is, however, neither my wish nor expectation, that the 
preceding observations should claim any regard, ex- 
cept so far as they shall appear to be dictated by a 
good intention, consonant to the immutable rules of 
justice, calculated to produce a liberal system of poli- 
cy, and founded on whatever experience may have 
been acquired by a long and close attention to public 
business. Here I might speak with the more confi- 
dence, from my actual observations ; and, if it would 
not swell this letter (already too prolix) beyond the 
bounds I had prescribed to myself, I could demonstrate, 



1'artII.I Tlir. AMKKICA.N H K V OI.UTIO N . '1-')1 

to every iiiiml open to conviction, lh;il in Irss time, and 
willi much less expense, than lias been incurred, the 
war might have been brought to tlie same happy con- 
chision, if the resources of the continent could have 
been properly drawn lorlh ; that the distresses and 
disappointments, which have very often occurred, have, 
in too many instances, resulted more Irom a want of 
enernv in the Continental government, than a deficiency 
ot" means in the particular States ; that the inellicacy 
of measures arising from the want of an adequate au- 
thority in the supreme power, from a partial compliance 
with the requisitions of Congress in some of the States, 
and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it 
tended to damp the zeal of those, who were more 
willing to exert themselves, served also to accumulate 
the expenses of the war, and to frustrate the best con- 
certed plans ; and that the discouragement occasioned 
by the complicated didiculties and embarrassments, in 
which our adairs were by this means involved, would 
have long ago produced the dissolution of any army, 
less patient, less virtuous, and less persevering, than 
that which I have had the honor to command. But, 
while I mention these things, which arc notorious facts, 
as the defects of our federal constitution, particularly 
in the prosecution of a war, I beg it may be under- 
stood, that, as I have ever taken a pleasure in gratefully 
acknowledging the assistance and support I have de- 
rived from every class of citizens, so shall I always be 
happy to do justice to the unparalleled exertions of the 
individual States on many interesting occasions. 

I have thus freely disclosed what I wished to make 
known, before I surrendered up my public trust to 
those who committed it to me. The task is now ac- 
complished. I now bid adieu to your Excellency as 
the chief magistrate of your State, at the same time 



452 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 51. 

I bid a last farewell to the cares of office, and all the 
employments of public life. 

It remains, then, to be my final and only request, that 
your Excellency will communicate these sentiments to 
your legislature at their next meeting, and that they 
may be considered as the legacy of one, who has 
ardently wished, on all occasions, to be useful to his 
country, and who, even in the shade of retirement, will 
not fail to implore the Divine benediction upon it. 

I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would 
have you, and the State over which you preside, in his 
holy protection ; that he would incline the hearts of 
the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and 
obedience to government ; to entertain a brotherly af- 
fection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens 
of the United States at large, and particularly for their 
brethren who have served in the field ; and finally, that 
he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all 
to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves 
with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, 
which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of 
our blessed reUgion, and without an humble imitation 
of whose example in these things, we can never hope 
to be a happy nation. 

I have the honor to be, with much esteem and re- 
spect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and most 
humble servant.* 



* The legislatures, that were sitting when this letter was received, 
passed resolves highly honorary to the Commander-in-chief ; and the 
governors of the States wrote letters to him expressing thanks and 
gratitude for his long, devoted, and successful services in the cause of 
his country.

Sill, 

I \va.s yesterday favored with your letter of the 12th 
of February, and this day 1 transmitted the papers, 
which accompanied it, to the President of Congress, 
with a letter of which the enclosed is a copy. 

Your early attachment to the cause of this country, 
and your exertions in relieving the distresses of such 
of our fellow citizens, as were so unfortunate as to be 
prisoners in Ireland, claim the regard of every Ameri- 
can, and will always entitle you to my particular es- 
teem. I shall always be happy in rendering you every 
service in my power, being with great truth, Sir, your 
very obedient servant.* 

• Mr. Harvey was a merchant of Cork in Ireland, who had done 
many acts of humanity and kindness for tlie American pri.soncrs during 
the war. He sent certain papers to General Washington on this 
subject, who forwarded them to Congress, and wrote to the President 
as follows. 

" The early part this gentleman appears to have taken in the cause 
of this country, and his exertions in relieving those of our fellow citi- 
zens, whom the fortune of war threw into tlic hands of the enemy, enti- 
tle him to the esteem of every American, and will doubtless have due 
weight in recommending him to tlie notice of Congress." 

On receiving this letter and the papers. Congress passed a vote of 
thanks, which was communicated to Mr. Harvey with the following letter 
firom General Washington.

as I am, with sentiments of gratitude to you for this expression of your 
benevolence, I feel a very particular gratification in conveying to you

TO MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Head-Quarters, 24 June, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
Previous to your departure from the army, I wished 
to take an opportunity of expressing my sentiments 
of your services, my obhgations for your assistance, 
and my wishes for your future felicity. Our object 
is at last obtained ; the arrangements are almost com- 
pleted, and the day of separation is now at hand. 
Permit me, therefore, to thank you for the trouble 
you have lately taken in the arrangement of the corps 
under your orders, as well as for all your former 
cheerful and able exertions in the public service. Suf- 
fer me to offer this last testimony of my regard for 
your merits ; and give me leave, my dear Sir, to as- 
sure you of the real affection and esteem with which 
I am, and shall at all times and under all circumstan- 
ces continue to be, your sincere friend and very hum- 
ble servant. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 24 June, 1783. 

Sir, 
It was not until three o'clock this afternoon, that I 
had the first information of the infamous and outrageous 
mutiny of a part of the Pennsylvania troops. It was 
then I received your Excellency's letter of the 2 1st by 
your express, and, agreeably to your request contained 
in it, I instantly ordered three complete regiments of 
infantry and a detachment of artillery to be put in mo- 
tion as soon as possible. This corps, which, you will 
observe by the return, is a large proportion of our whole 



P*rtI1.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 455 

force, will consist of upwards of fifteen hundred effec- 
tives. As all the troops, who composed this gallant 
little army, as well those who are rurl()Ui;hed, as those 
who remain in service, are men of trictl falclit}', I could 
not have occasion to make any choice of corps ; and I 
have only to regret, that there exists a necessity, that 
they should be employed on so disagreeable a service. 
1 dare say, however, they will on this ami all other 
occasions perform their duty, as brave and faithful sol- 
diers. 

While I sufl'rr the most poignant distress, in observ- 
ing that a handful of men, contemptible in numbers, 
and equally so in point of service (if the veteran troops 
from the southward have not been seduced by their 
example), and who are not worthy to be called soldiers, 
should disgrace themselves and their country as the 
Pennsylvania mutineers have done, by insulting the 
sovereign authority of the United States and that of 
their own, I feel an inexpressible satisfaction, that even 
this behaviour cannot stain the name of the American 
soldiery. It cannot be imputable to, or reflect dishonor 
on, the army at large ; but on the contrary, it will, by 
the striking contrast it exhibits, hold up to public view 
the other troops in the most advantageous point of 
light. Upon taking all the circumstances into consid- 
eration, I cannot sufficiently express my surprise and 
indignation at the airogance, the folly, and the wicked- 
ness of the mutineers ; nor can I sufficiently admire the 
fidelity, the bravery, and the patriotism, which must for 
ever signalize the unsullied character of the other 
corps of our army. For, when we consider, that these 
Pennsylvania levies, who have now mutinied, are re- 
cruits and soldiers of a day, who have not borne the 
heat and burden of the war, and who can have in 
reality very few hardships to complain of; and when we 



456 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Et. 5L 

at tlie same time recollect, that those soldiers, \vho have 
lately been furloughed from this army, are the veterans 
who have patiently endured hunger, nakedness, and 
cold, who have sufifered and bled without a murmur, 
and who, with perfect good order, have retired to their 
homes without a settlement of their accounts, or a 
farthing of money in their pockets ; we shall be as 
much astonished at the virtues of the latter, as we are 
struck with horror and detestation at the proceedings 
of the former; and every candid mind, without indulg- 
ing ill-grounded prejudices, will undoubtedly make the 
proper discrimination. 

I intended only to wait until the troops were col- 
lected, and had occupied their new camp, in order to 
make a full report to Congress of the measures, which 
have been taken in consequence of the resolution of 
the 26th of May. IVotwithstanding the option, which 
was given in my answer to the address of the generals 
and officers commanding regiments and corps, which 
has been already sent to your Excellency, no soldiers, 
except a very few, whose homes are within the ene- 
my's Unes, and a very small number of officers, have 
thought proper to avail themselves of it, by remaining 
with the army. A list of those who remain is here- 
with transmitted. The men engaged to serve three 
years were then formed into regiments and corps in 
the following manner ; namely, the troops of Massachu- 
setts compose four regiments ; Connecticut, one regi- 
ment ; New Hampshire, five companies ; Rhode Island, 
two companies ; Massachusetts artillery, three compa- 
nies ; and New York artillery, two companies. The 
total strength will be seen by the weekly state, which 
is also ibrwarded. 

The army being thus reduced to merely a compe- 
tent gaiTison for West Point, that being the only object 



1'artII.j tiik am Kill can 11 1: V o lu ti t) n . 457 

of importance in this quarter, aiul it being necessary to 
employ a considerable part of the men in building an 
arsenal and magazines at that post, agreeably to the 
directions given by the secretary at war, the troops 
accorilingly broke up the cantonment yesterday, and 
removed to that garrison, where Major-General Knox 
still retains the command. The detachment, which 
marches for Philadelphia, will be under the orders ol" 
Major-General Howe, iMajur-General Heath having, at 
his own particular request, retired from the field. The 
brigadiers now remaining with the army are Paterson, 
Huntington, and Greaton, besides the adjutant-general. 
Thus have I given the present state of our military 
affairs, and I hope the arrangements will be satisfac- 
tory to Congress. I have the honor to be, &lc. 

P. S. Should any thing turn up, which may pre- 
vent the necessity of the troops proceeding to Phila- 
delphi;i, I am to request your Excellency will send 
the earliest intimation to the commanding ofliccr, that 
the detachment may return immediately. The route 
will be by Ringwood, Pompton, Morristown, Princeton, 
and Trenton, on which your express may meet the 
corps.* 

* In consequence of the mutinous temper and menacing conduct of 
armed soldiers in Philadelphia, Congress resolved, " that the secretary 
at war be directed to communicate to the Commander-in-chief the state 
and disposition of the said troops, in order that he may take measures 
to despatch to this city such force as he may judge expedient for sup- 
pressing any disturbances that may ensue." — Joiimala, Jtmeilst. Con- 
gress adjourned the same day, and reassembled at Princeton, in New 
Ji'rsey, on the 30th. The causes of this change of residence, and the 
particulars concerning the mutiny, are explained in a report of a com- 
mittee entered in the Journals, July UL

TO MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Instructions. 
Sir, 

You are to take the command of the detachment, 
ordered to march to Philadelphia, in consequence of 
the letter of the President of Congress of the 21st 
instant. You will move with as much expedition as 
you can, consistently with the health and comfort of 
the troops. This corps will be absolutely light and 
unencumbered with baggage, having only two pieces 
of field-artillery. You will make arrangements with 
the quartermaster-general for the transportation, and 
with the contractors for a supply of provisions and 
rum. Your route will be by way of Ringwood, Pomp- 
ton, Mori'istown, and Princeton to Trenton, where it 
would be most convenient, if you could make arrange- 
ments for embarking the troops, to proceed from thence 
by water to Philadelphia; but this must depend upon 
circumstances, and will require circumspection to pre- 
vent the mutineers from taking advantage and annoy- 
ing your landing. 

The object of your command is to suppress a mu- 
tiny, which has taken place amongst a part of the 
Pennsylvania troops ; in the accomplishment of which 
you will be governed by your own discretion, until 
you can receive the orders of Congress, Should the 
tumult have subsided, you will meet directions from 
the President, countermanding your march. You will 
then return by easy movements. 

In all cases you will be pleased to pay particular 
attention to the order and discipline of the troops, and 
you will regulate youi- marches early in the morning 
(ir at evening, in such manner that the men may rest 
in the heat of the day ; and be as conveniently ac-

TO THK I'RKSIUKNT OF CO.VGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 30 June, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excel- 
lency's favor of the '26ih, ami to thank you for the 
information contained in it. 

If Congress should have already taken up, or should 
they be about to determine on the subject of receiv- 
ing possession of the posts on the western frontier, 
which was mentioned in my letters of the 3d of May 
and 7th of June, I would take the liberty to recom- 
mend Major-General the Baron Steuben, who will have 
the honor of delivering this letter, as a gentleman very 
much acquainted with military dispositions, as well as 
with the language commonly spoken in Canada ; and 
on those accounts particularly calculated to make the 
arrangements, which may be necessary on this occa- 
sion. The Baron will not hesitate to undertake the 
negotiation with General Ilaldimand, if it should be 
agreeable to the sentiments of Congress ; and I need 
only add, that, from the zeal and intelligence he has 
always manifested in the public service, a judgment 
may be formed of the attention and fidelity, which 
may be expected of him in the performance of this 
or any other duty, which shall be committed to his 
charge. I have the honor to be, Si.c. 

• When General Howe arrived at Princeton, he was ordered by Con- 
gress with his detachment to Philadelphia, where some of the leaders 
of the mutiny hart been arrested, and were to be tried by a court- 
martial.

Head-Quarters, State of New York, 10 July, 1783. 

Sir, 

You profess not to be a panegyrist, while you are 
bestowing the most exalted praise ; but, compliments 
apart, I received your very polite letter of the 25th 
of March with much pleasure. It recalled to my re- 
membrance some of the pleasing occurrences of my 
past life, and reminded me of the acquaintances I had 
formed in it ; for whom, though separated by time, 
distance, and political sentiments, I retain the same 
friendship. 

I was opposed to the policy of Great Britain, and 
became an enemy to her measures ; but I always dis- 
tinguished between a cause and individuals ; and, while 
the latter supported their opinions upon liberal and 
generous grounds, personally I never could be an en- 
emy to them. 

I have only to request, therefore, that you will suf- 
fer me to retain that place in your friendship, which 
you assure me I now hold ; and that you will accept 
my sincere thanks for the favorable sentiments you 
have been pleased to express of me, and will do me 
the justice to believe, that, with great esteem and re- 
gard, I have the honor to be, &c.

Ilcad-Quartore, on Hudson's River, 12 July, 1783. 

Sin, 

The Congress of the United States having instructed 
me to make the proper arrangements with the Com- 
nuuuler-in-chiet" of (he British forces in America, for 
receiving possession of the posts in the United States 
occupied l)y the troops of his Britannic Majesty, and 
from which his Majesty's troops are to be withdrawn, 
agreeably to the seventh article of the provisional treaty, 
I have to inform your Excellency, that I have desired 
Major-GenenU the Baron Steuben, who will have the 
honor to deliver this letter, to proceed for that purpose 
into Canada ; and I have fully empowered and author- 
ized him to form every arrangement with your Excel- 
lency, which may be found necessary, for receiving 
possession of the posts and fortresses on the north- 
western and western frontier of the territory of the 
United States, now under your direction ; and I beg 
you to be persuaded, that whatever agreements this 
officer shall form with your Excellency, respecting 
this business, will be punctually observed on the part 
of the United States. 

Baron Steuben is instructed to visit the posts within 
the boundary of the United States upon the River St. 
Lawrence and the Lakes above, and to report to me 
his opinion of the measures necessary for the garri- 
soning and support of them. In this tour, and in the 
execution of this business, I flatter myself he will re- 
ceive the necessary passports from your Excellency, 
and derive such aids as will enable him to fulfil the 
objects of his commission. 

As a foreigner, and an officer of rank and reputa-

tion, I beg leave to recommend the Baron to your 
Excellency's particular notice and attention. As a gen-

civilities. I have the honor to be, &,c. 



TO BARON STEUBEN. 

Instructions. 

In consequence of powers in me invested for that 
purpose, I do hereby authorize and desire you to pro- 
ceed, with such despatch as you shall find convenient, 
into Canada, and there concert with General Haldi- 
mand, or other British commander-in-chief in that pro- 
vince, all such measures as you shall find necessary for 
receiving possession of the posts now under his com- 
mand within the territory ceded to the United States, 
and at present occupied by the troops of his Britannic 
Majesty, and from which his said Majesty's troops are 
to be withdrawn, agreeably to the seventh article of 
the provisional treaty between his said Majesty and the 
United States of America. 

In accomplishing this negotiation, you will obtain, if 
possible, from General Haldimand his assurances and 
orders for the immediate possession, by the United 
States, of the posts in question, or at least a cession 
of them at an early day. But if this cannot be done, 
you will endeavour to procure from him positive and 
definitive assurances, that he will, as soon as possible, 
give information of the time that shall be fixed on for 
the evacuation of those posts, and that the troops of 
his Britannic Majesty shall not be drawn therefrom, 
until sufficient previous notice shall be given of that 
event, that the troops of the United States may be 



Part 11.] THE A M 1) li I C A N R K V O L U T I () N. 4C3 

ready to occupy the fortresses as soon as they shall 
be abancloned by those ol" his Britannic Majesty. 

You will propose to General Haldirnand, an exchange 
of such arlillcry and stores now in the posts as you 
shall think proper, and which you shall judge will be 
ol" benefit to the United States, agreeing with the Brit- 
ish commander-in-chief, that an equal number of can- 
non, and an ecjual cjuantity and kind of stores, to what 
he may consent to exchange, shall be replaced to his 
Britannic Majesty by the United States, at such time 
and place as shall be fixed on by you for the purpose. 

Having formed your arrangements with General Hal- 
dirnand, you will be pleased to proceed, in such man- 
ner as you shall think best, to visit the several posts 
and fortresses on the h'ontier territory of the United 
States as far as Detroit. View their diflerent situa- 
tion, strength, and circumstances ; and, forming your 
judgment of their relative jjosition, and probable advan- 
tages to the United States, you will report the same to 
me, with your opinion of such of them as you shall 
think it most expedient for the United States to retain 
and occupy. In passing Lake Champlain you will criti- 
cally observe the width of the waters at the northern 
extremity, and the nature of the ground adjoining ; 
with a view to determine whether there is any spot 
south of the 45th degree of north latitude, and near 
our extreme boundary, on which it will be convenient, 
should Congress judge it expedient, to erect fortifica- 
tions, which would command the entrance from Canada 
into that lake. 

At Detroit you will find a very considerable settle- 
ment, consisting mostly of French people from Cana- 
da. To these you will please to intimate in the fullest 
manner the good disposition of Congress and the 
inhabitants of the United States for their welfare and 



464 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

protection; expressing at the same time to them our 
expectations of finding the like disposition in them lo- 
wards us, and the post which we may establish there, 
and any future settlement which may be formed in 
their neiglibourhood by the subjects of the United 
States. As the advanced season, or other unforeseen 
accidents, may render it difficult to get a detachment 
of American troops to that place before it may be con- 
venient for the British garrison to be withdrawn from 
that post, you will do well to engage, in this case, some 
one or more of the respectable and well disposed in- 
habitants of the district to provide a company of mili- 
tia (if there be any) or others, at the expense of the 
United States, to take charge of the works and build- 
ings of the fortress, assuring them such reasonable pay 
as shall be deemed adequate to their service, or as 
you may condition for. You will also make particular 
inquiry, whether the farmers or merchants at Detroit 
are able or willing to supply an American garrison at 
that post with provisions and other necessaries, and 
upon what terms. 

You will please to keep me informed as fully as you 
can, and as often as opportunity will permit, of the 
progress you shall make in executing the business com- 
mitted to your conduct. 

Confiding perfectly in your general knowledge, your 
sense, judgment, and discretion, in the fulfilment of this 
commission, I forbear any further detail of instructions ; 
but wish you success in your negotiations, with pleas- 
ure and security in the prosecution of your tour. Giv- 
en at Head -Quarters, Newburg, this 12th day of July,

Canada. He reached Chamblee on tlie 2d of August, and thence sent 
forward his aid-de-camp, Major North, to Quebec, with a message to

TO PHILIP SCIIUYI.EIl. 

Hcad-Ciuartcrs, Ncwburg, 15 July, 1783. 

Df.ak Sir, 

I liuvc always eiiterlaiiiecl a great desire to see the 
northern part of this State, before I returned to the 
southward. The present iriisome interval, while we 
are waitini^ for the definitive treaty, adbrds an oppor- 
tunity of gratifying this inclination. I have therefore 
concerted with Governor Clinton to make a tour to 
reconnoitre those places, where the most remarkable 
posts were established, and the ground which became 
famous by being the theatre of action in 1777. On 
our return from tlience, we propose to pass across 
the Mohawk River, in order to have a view of that 
tract of countrv, which is so much celebrated for the 
lertility of its soil and the beauty of its situation. We 
shall set out by water on Friday the 18th, if nothing 
should intervene to prevent our journey. 

Mr. Dimler, assistant quartermaster-general, who will 
have the honor of delivering this letter, precedes us 
to make arrangements, and particularly to have some 
light boats provided and transported to Lake George, 
that we may not be delayed on our arrival there. 

1 pray you, my dear Sir, to be so good as to ad- 

Genernl Mnldimand announcing the object of his mission. General Hal- 
dimnnd was just on the eve of his departure for tlie upper country, and 
he met B.iron Steuben at Sorel, on the t^th of .Autjust. In regard to the 
first point of the instructions, General HaldimanJ said that he had not 
received orders for making any arrangements to evacuate the posts, nor 
for any other object th in a cessation of hostilities, with which he had 
strictly complied. A request for passports to visit the posts, on the part 
of Baron Steuben, was likewise refused by General Ilaldimand, upon the 
same ground of want of orders. In short, lie did not feel himself au- 
thorized to enter into any negotiations whatever, respi'cting the obj»ctd 
for which Baron Steuben had come to Caiiada, and the latter retuintid 
from Sorel to the American army.

vise Mr. Dimler in what manner to proceed in this 
business, to excuse the trouble I am about to give 
you, and to be persuaded that your kind informadon 
and direction to the bearer will greatly increase the 
obligations, with which I have the honor to be, &c. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, IG July, 1783. 

Sir, 
The enclosed memorial was handed to me from some 
officers of Hazen's regiment, refugees from Canada. 
Anxious for their relief from the most distressing sit- 
uation, and finding myself without the means or the 
power of doing it, I beg leave to refer their circum-, 
stances to the particular attention and regard of Con- 
gress. These, with many others, they will say, are the 
men who have left their country, their friends, their 
substance, their all, in support of the liberties of Amer- 
ica ; and have followed our fortunes through the various 
scenes of a distressing contest, until they find it to 
have terminated in the happiest manner for all but 
themselves. Some provision is certainly due to those 
people, who now are exiled from their native country 
and habitations, without any mention made of them in 
the treaty, any stipulation for their return, or any means 
for their subsistence, in a country which their arms have 
contributed to secure and establish. When Congress 
recollect the encouragements, the promises, and assur- 
ances, which were published by them and by their orders 
in Canada in the years 1775 and 1776, I am persuaded 
they will take into their most serious consideration the 
case of those unhappy persons, who placed confidence 
in those proclamations, and make ample amends by 



Part 11.] T II K A M I, K i C A .N K K V U L U T 1 U .\ . I'J? 

some effectual provision for their sufferings, patience, 
and perseverance. 

I WDulil not presume to dictate ; but, if Congress 
cannot [irocure liiiuls lor their compensation and sub- 
sistence from the ample confiscations, wiiich are making 
within the different States, I should think a grant could 
be made to thiin from iIr- unlocated lands in the in- 
terior part of our territory, and some means advanced 
to place them on such a tract. This perhaps might 
prove satisfactory, and would enable them to form a 
settlement, which may be beneficial to themselves, 
and useful to the United States. I will say no more, 
but repeat my recommendation of their case to the 
grateful remembrance of Congress, and beg, that a 
speedy attention may be given to the application, which 
I have advised them to make without delay. 

Finding myself in most disagreeable circumstances 
here, and likely to be, so long as Congress are pleased 
to continue me in this awkward .situation, anxiously 
expecting the definitive treaty ; without command, and 
with little else to do, than to be teasetl with trouble- 
some applications and fruitless demands, which I have 
neither the means nor the power of satisfying ; in this 
distressing tedium I have resolved to wear away a lit- 
tle time, in performing a tour to the northward, as far 
as Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and perhaps as far 
up the Mohawk River as Fort Schuyler. I shall leave 
this place on Friday next, and shall probably be gone 
about two weeks, unless my tour should be interrupted 
by some special recall. One gentleman of my family 
will be left here to receive any letters or commands, 
and to forward to me any thing that shall be neces- 
sary. With great respect and esteem, I have the hon- 
or to be, &,c.

TO JAMES MCHEXRY, IN CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 6 August, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

After a tour of at least seven hundred and fifty 
miles, performed in nineteen days, I returned to this 
place yesterday afternoon, where I found your favor of 
the 31st ultimo, intimating a resolution of Congress for 
calling me to Princeton, partly, as it would seem, on 
my own account, and partly for the purpose of giving 
aid to Congress ; but the President not having sent on 
the resolution, I am left ignorant of the particular ob- 
jects Congress have in view, any further than can be 
collected from the expressions of his and your letters. 
So far then, as they may relate to a peace establish- 
ment, my sentiments in the fullest manner have been 
communicated to a committee, of which Colonel Ham- 
ilton was chairman. If the principal object in view, 
by my attendance, respects Congress, I cannot hesitate 
a moment to make the earliest compliance in my 
power. But, if the resolution is calculated for my own 
convenience, I cannot say, that it will render my sit- 
uation more eligible than the present, especially taking 
into consideration the inconvenience of a removal for 
so small a distance, and a new establishment of a 
household, which must be formed in consequence of 
breaking up the menial part of my family here. 

My principal intention, in my letter of the 16th ul- 
timo, was to express the disagreeableness of my pres- 
ent situation, waiting as I am, with little business and 
less command, for the definitive treaty, when I have 
so anxious a desire of retiring from public business, 
and reestabUshing myself in domestic life, where my 
private concerns call loudly for my presence. 

I wish you, therefore, my dear Sir, to transmit to

tion, uitli an explanation of the particular reasons and 
principal motives, which have inlluenced Congress to

my return last evening, which I effected by water from 
Albany. 

My tour having been extended as far northward as 
Crown Point, and westward to Fort Schuyler and its

the northward. — Joiirnal.i, July 2Slh. No reason had been assigned for 
this request, nor any explanation given as to the purposes for which his 
presence was desired. On this point Mr. Mcllenry replied as follows. 

" The first motive for bringing you here was to get you out of a dis- 
agreeable situation to one less disagreeable. The second was to get your 
assistance and advice in the arrangements for peace. It may be necessa- 
ry, besides, to consult you respecting promotions, and on a variety of mili- 
tary subjects. I believe, on the whole, that your being near Congress 
will be a public good. I send you tlie address to be made to you from 
the chair, which will serve to explain the intentions of Congress." —

have an opportunity to transmit to me the resolution 
mentioned, that I may be acquainted" with the objects 
Congress have in view, by my attendance at Prince- 
ton, and that I may prepare myself to fulfil their ex- 
pectations to the utmost of my power. 

Another Letter of the same date. — I was the more 
particularly induced by two considerations to make the 
tour, which, in my letter of the 16th ultimo, I informed 
Congress I had in contemplation, and from which I 
returned last evening. The one was an inclination 
to see the northern and western posts of this State, 
with those places which have been the theatre of im- 
portant military transactions; the other, a desire to fa- 
cilitate, as far as is in my power, the operations, which 
will be necessary for occupying the posts which are 
ceded by the treaty of peace, as soon as they shall 
be evacuated by the British troops. 

Aware of the difficulties we shall have to encounter 
in accomplishing the last mentioned object, on account 
of the advanced season, and the want of money to give 
vigor to our movements, I inserted a clause in the in- 
structions to Baron Steuben, a copy of which I have 
the honor to enclose, authorizing him, in case those 
difficulties should be insurmountable, or in case the 
airival of the definidve treaty should be delayed be- 
yond expectation, to agree with some of the respecta- 
ble and well affected inhaliitants of Detroit to preserve 
the fortifications and public buildings at that place, 
until such time as a garrison could be sent with pro- 
visions and stores sufficient to take and hold possession 
of them. The propriety of this measure has appeared 



Pakt U.J Tilt; AMERICAN RK VOLUTION. -171 

in a more forcible point of lij^ht, since I have been uj) 
the Mohawk River, ami taken a view of the situation 
of things in that (juarUT ; for, upon a careful inquiry, 
I find it is tiie opinion of those, who arc best acquainted 
with the distances and communications, that nothing 
short of the greatest exertions, and a sum adequate 
to the transportation, can even at this season furnish 
us with boats, and enable us to forward provisions and 
stores sullicient for a garrison to be supported at De- 
troit during the ensuing winter ; and, that without an 
immediate supply of money, it would be in vain to 
make the attempt. 

Inlluenced by this information, believing there was 
not a moment to be lost, and apprehending that Baron 
Steuben might be retarded in his progress by some 
unforeseen event, I engaged at Fort Rensselaer a gen- 
tleman, whose name is Cassaty, formerly a resident at 
Detroit, and who is well recommended, to proceed 
without loss of time, find out the disposition of the in- 
habitants, and make every previous inquiry, which might 
be necessary for the information of the Baron on his 
arrival, that he should be able to make such final ar- 
rangements, as the circumstances might appear to jus- 
tify. This seemed to be the best alternative on failure 
of furnishing a garrison of our own troops ; which, for 
many reasons, would be infinitely the most eligible 
mode, if the season and your means would possibly 
admit. 

I have at the same time endeavoured to take the 
best preparatory steps in my power for supplying all 
the garrisons on the western waters by the provision 
contract. I can only form my magazine at Fort Her- 
kimer, on the German Flats, which is thirty-two miles 
by land and almost fifty by water from the carrying- 
place between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek.

The route by the former is impracticable in its present 
state for carriages ; and by the other extremely difh- 
cult for batteaux, as the river is very much obstructed 
with fallen and floating trees, from the long disuse of 
the navigation. That nothing, however, which depends 
upon me, might be left undone, I have directed ten 
months' provision for five hundred men to be laid up 
at Fort Herkimer, and have ordered Colonel Willett, 
an active and good officer commanding the troops of 
this State, to repair the roads, remove the obstructions 
in the river, and, as far as can be effected by the la- 
bors of the soldiers, build houses for the reception of 
the provisions and stores at the carrying-place, in order 
that the whole may be in perfect readiness to move 
forward, so soon as the arrangement shall be made with 
General Haldimand. I shall give instructions to Major- 
General Knox, to have such ordnance and stores for- 
warded to Albany, as in the present view of matters 
may be judged necessary for the western posts ; and I 
will also write to the quartermaster-general, by this 
conveyance, on the subject of batteaux and the other 
articles, which may be required from his department. 
However, as I before observed, without money to pro- 
vide some boats, and to pay the expense of transporta- 
tion, it will be next to impossible to get these things 
even to Niagara. I have the honor to be, &c.*

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CO.NGRESS. 

HeuJ-Quartcrs, 14 August, 1783. 

Sir, 

By the last post I was honored with your Excel- 
lency's favor of the 1st instant, enclosing the resolve 
of Congress directing my attendance at Princeton. 

Notwithstanding my horses had arrived hut a day 
or two before, I should have set out immediately, had 
it not been for the indisposition of Mrs. Washington, 
who had been seized with a fever during my absence, 
has had a return of it since, and is now very weak and 
low. This circumstance, together with a desire of 
packing my papers and making arrangements for a 
final remove, (being uncertain of the objects Congress 
have in view, or how long I may be detained at Prince- 
ton,) will, I hope, avail as an excuse for my delay. 

I propose to set out on Monday next, provided 



following principal events of the war, in which General Washington 
commanded in person ; namely, the evacuation of Boston ; the capture 
of the Hessians at Trenton ; the battle of Princeton ; the action of 
Monmouth ; and the surrender of York. On the upper part of the 
front of the pedestal to be engraved as follows, ' The United States, 
tn Congress assembled, ordered this statue to be erected in the year 
of our Lord 1783, in honor of Geor/;e Jfashinglon, the illustrious 
Commnndrr-in-chief of the armies of the United Stales of America dur- 
ins; the tear, which vindicated and secured their liberty, sovereignly, and 
indepenilence.' 

" Resolved, that a statue conformable to the above plan be executed 
by the best artist in Europe, under the superintendence of the minister 
of the United States at the court of Versailles, and that money to de- 
fray the expense of tlie same be furnished from the treasury of the 
United States. 

" Resolved, that the secretary of Congress transmit to the minister 
of the United States at the court of Versailles the best resemblance 
of General Washington, lliat can be procured, for the purpose of having 
the above statue erected, together with the fittest description of the 
events, which are to be the subject of the basso-rilievo." — Journals,

ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT AJVD MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS.t 

Princeton, 26 August, 1783. 

Mr. President, 
I am too sensible of the honorable reception I have 
now experienced, not to be penetrated with the deepest 
feelings of gratitude. 

* From the Orderly Book. — "The Commander-in-chief, having been 
requested by Congress to give his attendance at Princeton, proposes to 
set out for that place to-morrow ; but he expects to have the pleasure 
of seeing tlie army again before he retires to private life. During his 
absence, Major-General Knox will retain the command of the troops, and 
all reports are to be made to him accordingly." — August 17th. 

This is the last record entered in the Orderly Book. General Wash- 
ington arrived at Princeton, and had a formal public audience of Con- 
gress on the 2Gth of August. 

t When General Washington entered the hall of Congress, he was 
attended and introduced by two members, and the following Address (to 
which the above was a reply) was made to him by the President. 

" Sir, 

" Congress feel a particular pleasure in seeing your Excellency, 
and in congratulating you on the success of a war, in which you have 
acted so conspicuous a part. 

" It has been the particular happiness of the United States, that, 
during a war so long, so dangerous, and so important. Providence has 
been graciously pleased to preserve the life of a general, who has 
merited and possessed the uninterrupted confidence and affection of his 
fellow citizens. In other nations, many have performed eminent services, 
for which they have deserved the thanks of the public. But to you, Sir, 
peculiar praise is due. Your services have been essential in acquiring 
and establishing the freedom and independence of your country. They 
deserve the grateful acknowledgments of a free and independent nation 
Those acknowledgments Congress have the satisfaction of expressing 
to your Excellency. 

" Hostilities have now ceased ; but your country still needs your

Notwithstamliiii^ Conn;rcss seem to estimate tlic val- 
ue of my lil'e beyoiul any services I have been al)lo to 
render the United States, yet I must be permitted to 
considtT tlu' wisdom and unanimity of our national 
councils, the firmness of our titizens, and the patience 
and bravery of our troops, whicii have produced so 
happy a termination of the war, as the most conspicu- 
ous effect of the Divine interposition, and the surest 
presage of our future happiness. 

Highly gratified by the favorable sentiments, which 
Congress are pleased to express of my past conduct, 
and amply rewarded by the confidence and affec- 
tion of my fellow citizens, I cannot hesitate to con- 
tribute my best endeavours towards the establishment 
of the national security, in whatever manner the sov- 
ereign power may think proper to direct, until the 
ratification of the definitive treaty of peace, or the final 
evacuation of our country by the British forces ; after 
either of which events, I shall ask permission to retire 
to the peaceful shades of private life. 

Perhaps, Sir, no occasion may offer more suitable 
than the present, to express my humble thanks to God, 
and my grateful acknowledgments to my country, for 
the great and uniform support I have received in every 
vicissitude of fortune, and for the many distinguished 
honors, which Congress have been pleased to confer 
upon me in the course of the war.

important objects."

TO LIEUTENANT -COLONEL WILLIAM S. SMITH. 

Rocky Hill, 31 August, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I received your favor of the 26th, and am much 
obliged by your attention in procuring the articles I 
had requested. I am also glad to find there is at 
length a prospect, that the British will in reality soon 
take their departure from the United States. 

Whatever my private sentiments as an individual 
may be respecting the violent policy, which seems in 
some instances to be adopted, it is not for us, as mili- 
tary characters, to dictate a different line of conduct. 
But I should suppose the encouragement you have 
given to those British and foreign soldiei's, who have 
been discharged, that they would be permitted to re- 
main in the country, was very unexceptionable and 
proper. The same indulgence, however, cannot be 
extended to such natives of the country as have served 
in their new corps, without the particular interference 
of the States to which they belong. And I think it 
necessary you should be advised, that granting pass- 
ports to citizens, of any description, for the purpose 
of giving protection in coming from New York into the 
country, may not only be considered as an assumption 
beyond the limits of any commission, which has been 
derived from Congress, but will probably be produc- 
tive of altercations with the civil powers, and at the 
same time involve us in very disagreeable consequen- 
ces in many other respects. I am, dear Sir, with very 
great esteem yours, &c.* 

* It was the opinion of Colonel Smith, that there were not less than 
fifteen thousand persons in New York, who wished to remain, and were 
not conscious of any other crime, than that of residing witliin the 
British lines, but who would be driven from tlie country if rigid laws

TO JAMES DUANE, IN' CONGRESS. 

Rocky Hill, 7 September, 1783. 
Sin, 
1 Ikivc carefully perused tlie papers, which you put 
into my hand-s, rehilive to Iiuiiaii adairs. My senti- 
ments, witli respect to the proper line of conduct to 
be observed towards these people, coincide precisely 
with those delivered by General Schuyler, so far as 
he has gone, in his letter of the •29th of July to Con- 
gress (which, with the other papers, is herewith re- 
turned), and for the reasons he has there assigned ; 
a repetition of them therefore by me would be un- 
necessary. But, independent of the ar,u;uments made 
use of by him, the following considerations have no 
small weight in my mind. 

To suffer a wide-extended country to be overrun 
with land jobbers, speculators, and monopolizers, or 
even with scattered settlers, is in my opinion incon- 
sistent with that wisdom and policy, which our true in- 
terest dictates, or which an enlightened people ought to 
adopt ; and, besides, it is pregnant of disputes both with 
the savages and among ourselves, the evils of which 
are easier to be conceived than described. And for 
what, but to aggrandize a few avaricious men, to the 
prejudice of many and the embarrassment of govern- 
ment ? For the people engaged in these pursuits, with- 
out contributing in the smallest degree to the support 
of government, or considering themselves as amenable 



■were put in execution ngainst them ; " in consequence of which," said 
he, " upon tlie evacuation we shall find a city destitute of inhabitants, 
and settlements made on our frontiers by a people, who (their minds 
being soured by the severity of tlieir treatment,) will prove troublesome 
neighbours, and perhaps lay the foundation of future contests, which I 
■uppose it would be for the interest of our country to avoid." 



478 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jEt. 51. 

to its laws, will involve it, by their unrestrained con- 
duct, in inextricable perplexities, and more than proba- 
bly in a great deal of bloodshed. 

My ideas, therefore, of the hne of conduct proper 
to be observed, not only towards the Indians but for 
the government of the citizens of America, in their 
settlement of the western country, which is intimately 
connected therewith, are simply these. 

First, and as a preliminary, that all prisoners, of 
whatever age or sex, among the Indians, shall be de- 
livered up. 

That the Indians should be informed, that, after a 
contest of eight years for the sovereignty of this coun- 
try, Great Britain has ceded all the lands to the United 
States within the limits described by the article of the 
provisional treaty. 

That as they (the Indians), maugre all the advice 
and admonition that could be given them at the com- 
mencement and during the prosecution of the war, 
could not be restrained from acts of hostility, but were 
determined to join their arms to those of Great Britain 
and to share their fortunes, so consequently, with a less 
generous people than Americans, they would be made 
to share the same fate, and be compelled to retire along 
with them beyond the Lakes. But, as we prefer peace 
to a state of warfare; as we consider them as a deluded 
people; as we persuade ourselves that they are con- 
vinced, from experience, of their error in taking up the 
hatchet against us, and that their true interest and safety 
must now depend upon our fi'iendship ; as the country 
is large enough to contain us all; and as we are disposed 
to be kind to them and to partake of their trade, we 
will, from these considerations and from motives of com- 
passion, draw a veil over what is past, and establish a 
boundary line between them and us, beyond which we 



Part II.] TIIK AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 479 

will endeavour to restrain our people from hunting or 
settling, and within which they shall not come but for 
the purposes ol" trading, treating, or other hu.siness 
unexcepiioiiuble in its nature. 

In establishing this line, in the first instance, care 
should be taken neither to yield nor to grasp at too 
much ; but to endeavour to impress the Indians with 
an idea of the generosity of our disposition to accom- 
modate them, and of the necessity we are under, of 
proviiling for our waixiors, our young people who are 
growing up, and strangers who are coming from other 
countries to live among us ; and if they should make a 
point of it, or appear dissatisfied with the line we may 
find it necessary to establish, compensation should be 
made to them for their claims within it. 

It is needless for me to express more explicitly, be- 
cause the tendency of my observations evinces it is my 
opinion, that, if the legislature of the State of New York 
shoulil insist upon expelling the Six Nations from all 
the country they inhabited previous to the war, within 
their territory, as General Schuyler seems to be appre- 
hensive, it will end in another Indian war. I have every 
reason to believe from my inquiries, and the information 
I have receiveil, that they will not sufl'er their country 
(if it were our policy to take it before we could settle 
it) to be wrested from them without another struggle. 
That they would compromise for a part of it, I have 
very little doubt ; and that it would be the cheapest way 
of coming at it, I have no doubt at all. The same ob- 
servations, I am persuaded, will hold gooil \\ ith respect 
to Virginia, or any other State, which has powerful tribes 
of Indians on its frontiers; and the reason of my men- 
tioning New York is because General Schuyler has 
expressed his opinion of the temper of its legislature, 
and because I have been more in the way of learning 



480 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [/Et. 51. 

the sentiments of the Six Nations on the subject, than 
of any other tribes of Indians. 

The hmits being suthciently extensive, in the new 
country, to comply with all the engagements of govern- 
ment, and to admit such emigrations as may be sup- 
posed to happen within a given time, not only from the 
several States of the Union but from foreign countries, 
and, moreover, of such magnitude as to form a distinct 
and proper government; a proclamation, in my opin- 
ion, should issue, making it felony (if there is power for 
the purpose, if not, imposing some very heavy restraint) 
for any person to survey or settle beyond the line ; and 
the officers commanding the frontier garrisons should 
have pointed and peremptory orders to see that the 
proclamation is carried into eirect. 

Measures of this sort would not only obtain peace 
from the Indians, but would, in my opinion, be the 
surest means of preserving it ; and would dispose of 
the land to the best advantage, people the counti-y pro- 
gressively, and check land jobbing and monopolizing, 
which are now going forward with great avidity, while 
the door would be open and the terms known for every 
one to obtain what is proper and reasonable for himself, 
upon legal and constitutional ground. 

Every advantage, that could be expected or even 
wished for, would result from such a mode of proced- 
ure. Our settlements would be compact, government 
well established, and our barrier formidable, not only for 
ourselves but against our neighbours ; and the Indians, 
as has been observed in General Schuyler's letter, will 
ever retreat as our settlements advance upon them, and 
they will be as ready to sell, as we are to buy. That 
it is the cheapest, as well as the least distressing way 
of dealing with them, none, who is acquainted with the 
nature of Indian warfare, and has ever been at the 



PartII.J THK AMERICAN RK VOLUTION. 



481 



trouble of cstimntins the oxponsc of ono, and compar- 
inj5 it wiili llic cost of piircliasing their laiuls, will hesi- 
tate to acknowledge. 

Unless some such measures, as I have here taken 
the lihcrty of su^gostinii, are speedily adopted, one of 
two capitiil evils, in my opinion, will inevitably result, 
and is near at hand ; either the settling, or rather over- 
spreading, of the western country will take place by a 
parcel of banditti, who will bid defiance to all authority, 
while they are skimming and disposing of the cream of 
the country at the expense of many suflering officers 
and soldiers, who have fought and bled to obtain it, and 
■.\re now waiting the decision of Congress to point them 
to the promised reward of their past dangers and toils ; 
or a renewal of hostilities with the Indians, brought 
about more than probably by this very means. 

How fiu- agents for Indian aflairs are indispensably 
necessary, I shall not take upon me to decide ; but, if 
any should be appointed, their powers should be cir- 
cumscribed, accurately defined, and themselves rigidly 
punished for every infraction of them. A recurrence 
to the conduct of these people, under the British ad- 
ministration of Indian atTairs, will manifest the propriety 
of this caution, as it will there be found that self-interest 
was the principle by which their agents were actuated ; 
and to promote this by accumulating lands and passing 
large quantities of goods through their hands, the In- 
dians were made to speak any language they pleased 
bv their representation, and were pacific or hostile as 
their purposes were most likely to be promoted by the 
one or the other. No purchase under any pretence 
whatever should be made by any other authority than 
that of the sovereign power, or the legislature of the 
State in which such lands mav happen to be ; nor 
should the agents be permitted directly or indirectly

482 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 



to trade, but have a fixed and ample salary allowed 
them, as a full compensation for their trouble. 

Whether in practice the measure may answer as 
well as it appears in theory to me, I will not undertake 
to say ; but I think, if the Indian trade was conducted 
on government account, and with no greater advance 
than what would be necessary to defi-ay the expense 
and risk, and bring in a small profit, that it would sup- 
ply the Indians on much easier terms than they usually 
are, engross their trade, and fix them strongly in our 
interest, and would be a much better mode of treating 
them, than that of giving presents, where a few only 
are benefited by them. I confess there is a difficulty 
in getting a man, or set of men, in whose abiUties 
and integrity there can be a perfect reliance, without 
which the scheme is liable to such abuse as to defeat 
the salutary ends, which are proposed from it. At any 
rate, no person should be suffered to trade with the 
Indians without first obtaining a license, and giving se- 
curity to conform to such rules and regulations as shall 
be prescribed, as was the case before the war. 

In giving my sentiments in the month of May last 
(at the request of a committee of Congress) on a peace 
establishment, I took the liberty of suggesting the pro- 
priety, which in my opinion there appeared, of paying 
particular attention to the French and other settlers at 
Detroit and other parts within the limits of the west- 
ern country. The perusal of a late pamphlet, entitled 
" Observations on the Commerce of the American 
States with Europe and the West Indies," impresses 
the necessity of it more forcibly than ever on my mind. 
The author of that piece strongly recommends a liberal 
change in the government of Canada ; and, though he is 
too sanguine in his expectations of the benefits arising 
from it, there can be no doubt of the good policy of 



I'artII.] THi; AMKRICAN RKVOLUTION. 483 

the measure. It belioves us, therefore, to counteract 
them by anticipation. These people have a disposititJii 
towards us susceptible of favorable impressions ; but, 
as no arts will be left unattempted by the British to 
withilraw them from our interest, the present moment 
should be employed by us to fix them in it, or we may 
lose them for ever, and with them the advantages 
consequent on the choice they may make. From the 
best information and maps of that country it would 
appear, that tiie tciritory from the mouth of the Great 
Miami River, which empties into the Ohio, to its con- 
fluence with the INIad River, thence by a line to the 
Miami fort and village on the other Miami River, which 
empties into Lake Eric, and thence by a line to include 
the settlement of Detroit, would, with Lake Erie to the 
northward, Pennsylvania to the eastward, and the Ohio 
to the southward, form a government sufficiently ex- 
tensive to fulfil all the public engagements, and to re- 
ceive moreover a large population by emigrants ; and 
to confine the setdement of the new State within these 
bounds would, in my opinion, be infinitely better, even 
supposing no disputes were to happen with the Indians, 
and that it was not necessary to guard against these 
other evils that have been enumerated, than to suffer 
the same number of people to roam over a country of 
at least five hundred thousand square miles, contributing 
nothing to the support, but much perhaps to the em- 
barrassment, of the federal government. 

Were it not for the purpose of comprehending the 
settlement of Detroit within the jurisdiction of the new 
government, a more compact and better shaped district 
for a State would be, for the line to proceed from the 
Miami fort and village along the river of that name to 
Lake Erie ; leaving in that case the settlement of De- 
troit, and all the territory north of the rivers Miami 



484 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

and St. Joseph's between the Lakes Erie, St. Clair, 
Huron, and Michigan to form hereafter another State 
equally large, compact, and water-bounded. 

At first view it may seem a little extraneous, when 
I am called on to give an opinion upon the terms of a 
peace proper to be made with the Indians, that I should 
go into the formation of new States. But the settle- 
ment of the western country, and making a peace with 
the Indians, are so analogous, that there can be no 
considerations of the one, without involving those of 
the other ; for, I repeat it again, and I am clear in my 
opinion, that policy and economy point very strongly to 
the expediency of being upon good terms with the In- 
dians, and the propriety of pm-chasing their lands in 
preference to attempting to drive them by force of arms 
out of then- country ; which, as we have already expe- 
rienced, is like driving the wild beasts of the forest, 
which will return as soon as the pursuit is at an end, 
and faO perhaps upon those that are left there ; when 
the gradual extension of our settlements will as certain- 
ly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire ; both being 
animals of prey, though they differ in shape. In a 
word, there is nothing to be obtained by an Indian war, 
but the soil they live on, and this can be had by pur- 
chase at less expense, and without that bloodshed and 
those distresses, which helpless women and children 
are made partakers of in all kinds of disputes with 
them. 

If there is any thing in these thoughts, which I have 
fully and freely communicated, worthy of attention, I 
shall be happy, and am, Sir, your most obedient and 
most humble servant.

TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Rocky Hill, U September, 1783. 
My DEAK Sin, 

It was with great concern I heard of your indisposi- 
iit)i>. Later accounts say you were on the recovery, 
and nothing would give me more pleasure, than the 
confirmation of it, from under your own hand. 

I am not able to give you any information on the 
point you requested at our parting. Congress have 
come to no determination yet, respecting a peace 
establishment, nor am I able to say when they will. 
I have lately had a conference with a committee on 
this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, 
but it appears to me, that there is not a suflicient 
representation to discuss great national points ; nor do 
I believe there will be, while that honorable body con- 
tinue their sessions at this place. The want of accom- 
modation, added to a disinclination in the southern 
delegates to be further remove*.! than they formerly 
were from the centre of the emp'u-e, and an aversion 
in the others to ^Ive up what they conceive to be a 
point gained by the late retreat to this place, keep 
matters in an awkward situation, to the very great in- 
terruption of national concerns. Seven States, it seems, 
by the articles of confederation, must agree, before any 
place can be fixed upon for the seat of the federal 
government ; and seven States, it is said, never will 
agree ; consequently, as Congress came here, here 
they are to remain to the dissatisfaction of the majori- 
ty and a great let to business, having none of the public 
offices about them, nor any places to accommodate 
them, if they were brought up ; and the members, from 
this or some other cause, are eternally absent. With 
the sincerest esteem and regard, I am, dear Sir, &c.

486 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mt.51. 

TO LUND WASHINGTON. 

Rocky Hill, 20 September, 1783. 

Dear Lund, 

Mrs. Ciistis has never suggested in any of her letters 
to Mrs. Washington (unless ardent wishes for her re- 
turn, that she might then disclose it to her, can be so 
construed) the most distant attachment to D. S. ; but, 
if this should be the case, and she wants advice upon 
it, a father and mother, who are at hand and competent 
to give it, are at the same time the most proper to be 
consulted on so interesting an event. For my own 
part, I never did, nor do I beheve I ever shall, give 
advice to a woman, who is setting out on a matrimonial 
voyage ; first, because I never could advise one to 
marry without her own consent ; and, secondly, be- 
cause I know it is to no purpose to advise her to re- 
frain, when she has obtained it. A woman very rarely 
asks an opinion or requires advice on such an occasion, 
till her resolution is formed ; and then it is with the 
hope and expectation of obtaining a sanction, not that 
she means to be governed by your disapprobation, 
that she appUes. In a word, the plain English of the 
application may be summed up in these words ; " I wish 
you to think as I do ; but, if unhappily you differ from 
me in opinion, my heart, I must confess, is fixed, and I 
have gone too far 71010 to retract." 

If Mrs. Custis should ever suggest any thing of this 
kind to me, I will give her my opinion of the measure, 
not of the man, with candor, and to the following effect. 
" I never expected you would spend the residue of 
your days in widowhood ; but in a matter so important, 
and so interesting to yourself, children, and connexions, 
I wish you would make a prudent choice. To do which, 
many considerations are necessary ; such as the family 



nRTll.J TUK AMKIUCA.N U EVOLUTION. 487 

ami connexions of tht; man, his fortune (which is not 
tiie most usst'iitiai in my eye), the line of conduct he 
has observed, antl the disposition ami ti-ame of his 
mind. You sliould consider what prospect there is 
of his provini? kind and aflectionatc to you ; just, gen- 
erous, ami attentive to your children ; and iiow I'ar his 
connexions will be agreeable to you ; for when they 
are once formed, agreeable or not, the die being cast, 
your fate is fix(Ml." Thus far, and no ftvrther, I shall go 
iu my opinions. I am, dear Lund, &,c. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Rocky Hill, 9. October, 1783. 
SrR, 

I do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
a copy of a letter I have received from Colonel Kosci- 
uszko, on the subject of his promotion. The general 
promotion now before Congress, should it take place, 
would have included him ; but this does not seem to 
be his wish. As a foreigner, I suppose a particulai* 
promotion would be more consonant to his views and 
interest ; and from my knowledge of his merit and ser- 
vices, and the concurrent testimony of all who know 
him, I cannot but recommend him as deserving the 
favor of Congress. I have the honor to be, &c.* 

• This letter was referred to a committee, in consequence of whoso 
report it was resolved, "that the secretary at war transmit to Colonel 
Kosciuszko the brevet commission of brigadier-general, and signify to 
that officer, that Congress entertain a high sense of his long, faithful, 
and meritorious services." — Joumab, October l'3th.

TO THE CHEVALIER DE CHASTELLUX. 

Princeton, 12 October, 1783. 

My dear Chevalier, 

1 have not had the honor of a line from you since 
the 4th of March last ; but I will ascribe my disappoint- 
ment to any cause, rather than to a decay of your 
friendship. 

Having the appearance, and indeed the enjoyment 
of peace, without a final declaration of it, I, who am 
only waiting for the ceremonials, or till the British forces 
shall have taken leave of New York, am placed in an 
awkward and disagreeable situation, it being my anxious 
desire to quit the walks of public life, and to seek those 
enjoyments and that relaxadon, which a mind, that has 
been constantly upon the stretch for more than eight 
years, stands so much in need of. 

I have fixed this epoch at the arrival of the definitive 
treaty, or the evacuation of my country by our newly 
acquired friends. In the mean while, at the request of 
Congress I spend my time with them at this place, 
where they came in consequence of the riots at Phila- 
delphia, of which you have doubtless (for it is not a 
very recent transaction) been fully apprized. They 
have lately determined to make a choice of some con- 
venient spot near the Falls of the Delaware for the 
permanent residence of the sovereign power of these 
United States ; but where they will hold their sessions 
till they can be properly established at that place, is 
yet undecided. 

I have lately made a tour through the Lakes George 
and Champlain, as far as Crown Point. Thence re- 
turning to Schenectady, I proceeded up the Mohawk 
River to Fort Schuyler (formerly Fort Stanwix), and 
crossed over to Wood Creek, which empties into the 



Piinll.l TIIK AMKIIUAN R K V OL L TION . 189 

Oiiciila Luke, and allbrils the water commiinicatiim 
with Ontario. I then traversed tl)e counlry to the 
heail 1)1" llie eastern l)raneh of the Siistjuehanna, and 
viewed the Lake Otsego, and the portage between 
that Lake and the Mohawk River at Canajoharie. 
Prompted by these actual observations, I could not 
help taking a more extensive view of the vast inland 
navigation of these United States, from maps and the 
information of others ; and could not but be struck 
with the immense extent and importance of it, and with 
the goodness of that Providence, which has dealt its 
favors to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God 
we may have wisdom enough to improve them. I sh;i]l 
not rest contented, till 1 have explored the western 
country, and traversed those lines, or great part of 
them, which have given hounds to a new empire. 
But when it may, if it ever shall, happen, I dare not 
say, as my first attention must be given to the deran- 
ged situation of my private concerns, which are not a 
httle injured by almost nine years' absence and total 
disregard of them. With every wish for your health 
and happiness, and with the most sincere and aflection- 
ate regard, I am, my dear Chevalier, &,c. 



TO MAJOR-GENERAL DCPORTAIL. 

Rocky Hill, I'.' October, 17ey. 

Dear Sir, 

General Laumoy and Colonel Gouvion did me jus- 
tice in mentioning the regret I feel at your intention of 
leaving this country. The personal attachment, which 
naturally grows out of such a length of service togeth- 
er, had I no other motive, would occasion a regret at 
parting ; but it is considerably heightened by your

quitting the service, and thereby depriving me of the 
hope of seeing you return to Ijenefit the country by 
your abilities and experience in your profession, if such 
an establishment, as this great empire ought to adopt 
for the peace of it, should be finally agreed to, but 
which at this moment is undecided. 

It would afford me much pleasure to tell you this 
personally before your departure ; but if I should not 
have this satisfaction, I beg you to be assured that you 
carry ^vith you every good wish I can form for you, and 
that I shall ever retain a grateful sense of the aids I 
have derived from your knowledge and advice, and 
more especially for the repeated testimonials I have re- 
ceived of your friendship and attachment to me. 

I am, deal- Sir, &.c. 



TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Rocky Hill, 23 October, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 
I was extremely glad to hear by a letter from Colonel 
Varick, that though not yet restored to your usual 
state of health, you were recovering it daily. From 
many circumstances I think it now pretty evident, that 
the British will leave New York in all next month. 
Sir Guy Carleton has informed me verbally, through 
Mr. Parker, that he expects to evacuate the city by the 
20th, and that, when the transports, which were gone to 
Nova Scotia, returned, he should be able to fix the day 
of his departure. In consequence of this intelligence, 
and fearful lest I should not have timely notice, I have 
this day written to General Knox, desiring him to con- 
fer with your Excellency, and raal^e every necessary 
arrangement for taking possession of the city the mo-

do inyseh' tlie hoiiur to enclose. With great esteem 
and respect, I have the honor to be, &,c. 

P. S. I was just on the point ot" closing this, when 
I received your Excellency's letter of the 11th instant, 
and I am sorry to learn from it that you are still in such 
a low state of health. The propriety of putting the 
troops, who may move towards the city, under your 
Excellency's direction, strikes me very forcibly, and I 
have mentioned it in a postscript to the letter to Gen- 
eral Knox. It will accordingly form part of the ar- 
rangement, which you may both agree on. I shiill with 
pleasure comply with your wishes, in sending you by 
express the first notice I get of the day intended for 
the evacuation. 



FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE ARMIES OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

Rocky Hill, near Princeton, 2 November, 1783. 

The United States in Congress assembled, after giv- 
ing the most honorable testimony to the merits of the 
federal armies, and presenting them with the thanks of 
their country for their long, eminent, and faithful ser- 
vices, having thought proper, by their proclamation 
bearing date the 18th day of October last, to discharge 
such part of the troops as were engaged for the war, 
and to permit the oflicers on furloughs to retire from 
service, from and after to-morrow ; which proclamation 
having been communicated in the public papers for the 
information and government of all concerned, it only 
remains for the Commandcr-in-chiof to address himself 
once more, tmd that for the last time, to the armies of 



492 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mt. 51. 

the United States (however widely dispersed the in- 
dividuals wiio composed them may be), and to bid them 
an affectionate, a long fai'ewell. 

But before the Commander-in-chief takes his final 
leave of those he holds most dear, he wishes to in- 
dulge himself a few moments in calliiig to mind a slight 
review of the past. He will then take the liberty of 
exploring with his military friends their future pros- 
pects, of advising the general line of conduct, which, 
in his opinion, ought to be pursued ; and he will con- 
clude the address by expressing the obligations he feels 
himself under for the spirited and able assistance he has 
experienced from them, in the performance of an ar- 
duous office. 

A contemplation of the complete attainment (at a 
period earlier than could have been expected) of the 
object, for which we contended against so formidable a 
power, cannot but inspire us with astonishment and 
gratitude. The disadvantageous circumstances on our 
part, under which the war was undertaken, can never 
be forgotten. The singular interpositions of Provi- 
dence in our feeble condition were such, as could 
scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving ; 
while the unparalleled perseverance of the armies of 
the United States, through almost every possible suffer- 
ing and discouragement for the space of eight long 
years, was little short of a standing miracle. 

It is not the meaning nor within the compass of this 
address, to detail the hardships peculiarly incident to 
our service, or to describe the distresses, which in 
several instances have resulted from the extremes of 
hunger and nakedness, combined with the rigors of an 
inclement season ; nor is it necessary to dwell on the 
dai'k side of our past affairs. Every American officer 
and soldier must now console himself for any unpleasant 



PartII.] the AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 493 

circumstances, which may have occurred, by a recollec- 
tion of the uncommon scenes in which he has been 
called to act no inglorious part, and the astonisliins; 
events of which he has been a witness ; events, which 
have seldom, if ever before, taken place on the stage 
of human action ; nor can they probably ever happen 
again. For who has before seen a disciplined army 
formed at once from such raw maten;xls ? Who, that 
was not a witness, could imagine, that the most violent 
local prejudices would cease so soon ; and that men, 
who came from the diffi-rent parts of the continent, 
strongly disposed by the habits of education to despise 
and quarrel with each other, would instantly become but 
one patriotic band of brothers 1 Or who, that was not 
on the spot, can trace the steps by which such a won- 
derful revolution has been eirected, and such a glorious 
period put to all our warlike toils ? 

It is universally acknowledged, that the enlarged 
prospects of happiness, opened by the confirmation of 
our independence and sovereignty, almost exceed the 
power of description. And shall not the brave men, 
who have contributed so essentially to these inestimable 
acquisitions, retiring victorious from the field of war to 
the field of agriculture, participate in all the blessings, 
which have been obtained ? In such a republic, who 
will exclude them from the rights of citizens, and the 
fruits of their labor? In such a country, so happily 
circumstanced, the pursuits of commerce and the culti- 
vation of the soil will unfold to industry the certain 
road to competence. To those hardy soldiers, who 
are actuated by the spirit of adventure, the fisheries 
will afford ample and profitable employment ; and the 
extensive and fertile regions of the West will yield a 
most happy asylum to those, who, fond of domestic 
enjoyment, are seeking for personal independence. Nor 

VOL. VIII. I' p 



494 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Et. 51. 

is it possible to conceive, that any one of the United 
States will prefer a national bankruptcy, and a disso- 
lution of the Union, to a compliance with the requisi- 
tions of Congress, and the payment of its just debts ; 
so that the officers and soldiers may expect considerable 
assistance, in recommencing their civil occupations, from 
the sums due to them from the public, which must and 
will most inevitably be paid. 

In order to effect this desirable purpose, and to re- 
move the prejudices, which may have taken possession 
of the minds of any of the good people of the States, 
it is earnestly recommended to all the troops, that, with 
strong attachments to the Union, they should carry with 
them into civil society the most conciliating dispositions, 
and that they should prove themselves not less virtuous 
and useful as citizens, than they have been persevering 
and victorious as soldiers. What though there should 
be some envious individuals, who are unwilling to pay 
the debt the public has contracted, or to yield the trib- 
ute due to merit ; yet let such unworthy treatment 
produce no invectives, nor any instance of intemperate 
conduct. Let it be remembered, that the unbiassed 
voice of the free citizens of the United States has 
promised the just reward and given the merited ap- 
plause. Let it be known and remembered, that the rep- 
utation of the federal armies is established beyond the 
reach of malevolence ; and let a consciousness of their 
achievements and fame still incite the men, who com- 
posed them, to honorable actions ; under the persua- 
sion that the private virtues of economy, prudence, and 
industry, will not be less amiable in civil life, than the 
more splendid qualities of valor, perseverance, and 
enterprise were in the field. Every one may rest as- 
sured, that much, very much, of the future happiness 
of the officers and men, will depend upon the wise and 



Pakt 11.) Tin: AM KIM I' AN 11 K V () LUTION. 495 

manly conduct, wliicli slnill be adopted by them when 
they are mingled uitli tin; great body of the commu- 
nity. And, alUiough the General lias so frecjuently 
given it as his opinion in the most public and explicit 
miuuiLT, that, unless the principles of the Federal Gov- 
ernment were properly supported, and the powers of 
the Union increased, the honor, dignity, and justice of 
the nation would be lost for ever ; yet he cannot help 
repeating, on this occasion, so interesting a sentiment, 
and leaving it as his last injunction to every olRcer and 
every soldier, who may view the subject in the same 
serious point of light, to add his best endeavours to 
those of his worthy fellow citizens towards eflecting 
these great and valuable purposes, on which our very 
existence as a nation so materially depends. 

The Commander-in-chief conceives little is now 
wanting, to enable the soldiers to change the military 
character into that of the citizen, but that steady and 
decent tenor of behaviour, which has generally distin- 
guished, not only the army under his immediate com- 
mand, but the ditl'crent detachments anil separate ar- 
mies, through the course of the war. From their good 
sense and prudence he anticipates the happiest conse- 
quences ; and, while he congratulates them on the glo- 
rious occasion, which renders their services in the field 
no longer necessary, he wishes to express the strong 
obligations he feels himself under for the assistance he 
has received from every class and in every instance, 
lie presents his thanks in the most serious and affec- 
tionate manner to the general officers, as well for their 
counsel on many interesting occasions, as for their ar- 
dor in promoting the success of the plans he had adopt- 
ed ; to the commandants of regiments and corps, and 
to the other officers, for their great zeal and attention 
in carrying his orders promptly into execution ; to the 



496 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [vEt. 51. 

staff, for their alacrity and exactness in performing the 
duties of their several departments ; and to the non- 
commissioned officers and private soldiers, for their ex- 
traordinary patience and suffering, as well as their in- 
vincible fortitude in action. To the various branches of 
the army, the General takes this last and solemn op- 
portunity of professing his inviolable attachment and 
friendship. He wishes more than bare professions were 
in his power ; that he were really able to be useful to 
them all in future life. He flatters himself, however, 
they will do him the justice to believe, that whatever 
could with propriety be attempted by him has been 
done. 

And being now to conclude these his last public 
orders, to take his ultimate leave in a short time of the 
military character, and to bid a final adieu to the ar- 
mies he has so long had the honor to command, he can 
only again offer in their behalf his recommendations to 
their grateful country, and his prayers to the God of 
armies. May ample justice be done them here, and 
may the choicest of Heaven's favors, both here and 
hereafter, attend those, who, under the Divine auspices, 
have secured innumerable blessings for others. With 
these wishes and this benediction, the Commander-in- 
chief is about to retire from service. The curtain of 
separation will soon be drawn, and the military scene 
to him will be closed for ever.

Excellency to Congress some lime past, that you had 
received orders for the evacuation of New York, antl 
of the verbal message you were pleased to send by 
Mr. Parker to me, respecting tlie period of embarkation, 
I am now induced to request, that you will be so oblig- 
ing as to inform me of the particulai- time, or even the 
certain day, if possible, when this event will happen. 

This information would be extremely interesting for 
my private as well as public arrangements. Indeed, I 
should not have troubled your Excellency with the re- 
quest, but for my peculiar circumstances and tln^ ad- 
vanced season, which render it essential for me to be 
ascertained of the period of your embarkation, as early 
as may be convenient ; and which, I entreat, may be 
considered as my apology for the present application.

* In consequence of the interview above suggested, between General 
Washington and Governor Clinton, the latter issued a proclamation, 
dated the I5th of November, giving notice of the day appointed by 
Sir Guy Carleton for evacuating the city, and summoning the several 
members of the council of New York to convene at East Chester, on 
the 2Ist, with a view of immediately establishing civil government in 
the districts of the State hitherto occupied by the British troops ; and 
at the same time enjoining and requiring the inhabitants of such parts 
to yield due obedience to the laws of the State, and to be vigilant in 
preserving the public peace and good order.

this conveyance, that the council instituted for the tem-

reservations, in full confidence that the embarkation 
will be expedited as much as the circumstances will 
admit. 

With regard to the information, that a deliberate 
combination has been formed to plunder the city of 
New York, 1 have to observe, that the intelligence 
appears to me not to be well-founded ; at least, no 
intimations of the kind had ever before come to my 
knowledge ; and I can assure your Excellency, that 
such aiTangements have been made, as will, in my 
opinion, not only utterly discountenance, but effectually 
prevent, any outrage or disorder, unless the evacuation 
should be delayed until a much larger number of peo- 
ple shall be collected from the country, than have been 
assembled as yet for the purpose of going into town 
on its being relinquished by your troops ; in which case 
the ditliculty of establishing civil government and main- 
taining good order may be greatly increased. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Walker will have the honor to 
deliver this letter to your Excellency, and to assure

TO THE I'RESIUE.NT OF CONGRESS. 

Annapolia, 20 December, 1783. 

Sir, 
I take the earliest opportunity to inform Congress 
of my an-ival in this city, with the intention of asking 
leave to resign the commission I have the honor of 
holding in their service. It is essential for me to know 
their pleasure, and in what manner it will he most 
proper to offer my resignation, whether in writing, or 
at an audience. I shall therefore request to be hon- 
ored with the necessary information, that, being ap- 
prized of the sentiments of Congress, I may regulate 
my conduct accordingly. I have the honor to be, &c. 

• Shortly after the evacuation of New York, General Washington left 
that city and repaired to Annapolia, at which place the members of Con- 
gress were then assembling. An affecting account of the manner in 
which he took leave of the officer.'', who had so long been his associates 
in arms, is contained in Marshall's Life of ff'ashington, Vol. IV. p. 619.

502 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 51. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Annapolis, 21 December, 1783. 

Sir, 

In my last despatch to your Excellency, I had the 
honor to inform Congress, that the American troops 
had taken possession of the city of New York, and had 
delivered it to the government of the State ; and that 
the British troops had retired to Staten and Long Isl- 
ands. I had also the honor to enclose to you Sir Guy 
Carleton's last letter, informing me of his intention to 
take his final departure from the continent, with the 
troops under his command, on the 4th of this month. 

As there was no longer a necessity for retaining so 
many troops in service for the posts at present in our 
possession, and as the terms of service of the men 
were expiring so fast, that fifteen hundred or two 
thousand would have been discharged by June next, 
I thought it most consistent with the state of our pub- 
lic atTairs to lessen the expense as soon as possible ; 
and I therefore gave directions to Major-General Knox 
before I left New York, to reduce the whole of the 
troops to one battalion of infantry of five hundred rank 
and file, and about one hundred artillery, and these 
to be of the men, who had the longest time to serve. 

To carry this arrangement into cflect, and to collect 
and put into a state of preservation the ordnance and 
other valuable military stores belonging to the United 
States, it was necessary that there should be some 
officer of rank and abilities ; and, as the latter business 
was in the particular line of General Knox, and none 
understood or could attend to it so well, I directed 

Pennsylvania, and Maryland ; the American Philosophical Society and 
the University of Pennsylvania ; the citizens of towns in their corporate 
capacity ; religious societies ; and various incorporated associations.

that orticer to continue in command, until the further 
pleasure of Congress should be made known to him.* 

Among the officers of the army, who have been 
obliged to retire at the conclusion ot" the war, are ma- 
ny, who, from various motives, are desirous of being 
aiTanged on any peace establishment that may take 
place. I take tlie liberty to lay before Congress the 
several applications, that have been made to me on the 
subject ; and in atldition to the testimony, which ac- 
companies them, 1 can only add mine, that most of the 
gentlemen whose names are on the list are personally 
known to me, as some of the best officers who were 
in the army. I am, &,c. 



TO BARON STEUBEN. 

Annapolis, 23 December, 1783. 

]\[y dear Baron, 

Although 1 have taken frequent opportunities, both 
in public and private, of acknowledging your great zeal, 
attention, and abilities, in performing the duUes of your 
office ; yet I wish to make use of this last moment 
of my public life to signify, in the strongest terms, my 
entire approbation of your conduct, and to express my 
sense of the obligations the public is under to you, 
for your faithful and meritorious services. 

I beg you will be convinced, my dear Sir, that I 
should rejoice if it could ever be in my power to serve 
you more essentially, than by expressions of regard 
and affection ; but, in the mean time, I am persuaded 
you will not be displeased with this farewell token of 
my sincere friendship and esteem for you. 

* The troops under General Knox returned to West Point, where he 
continued his head-quarters.

This is the last letter I shall write, while I continue 
in the service of my country. The hour of my resig- 
nation is fixed at twelve to-day ; after which, I shall 
become a private citizen on the banks of the Poto-

tify the great esteem and consideration with which I 
am, my dear Baron, &.c. 



GENERAL AVASHINGTOn's ADDRESS TO CONGRESS ON 
RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION.* 

Annapolis, 23 December, 1783. 

Mr. President, 

The great events, on which my resignation depend- 
ed, having at length taken place, I have now the honor 
of offering my sincere congratulations to Congress, and 
of presenting myself before them, to surrender into 
their hands the trust committed to me, and to claim 
the indulgence of retiring from the service of my 
country. 

Happy in the confirmation of our independence and 
sovereignty, and pleased with the opportunity afforded 
the United States of becoming a respectable nation, I 
resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with 
diffidence ; a ditfidence in my abilities to accomplish 
so arduous a task, which, however, was superseded 
by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause, the sup- 
port of the supreme power of the Union, and the pat- 
ronage of Heaven. 

The successful termination of the war has verified 
the most sanguine expectations ; and my gratitude for 
the interposition of Providence, and the assistance I 

• The reply of the President of Congress to this address may be 
seen in the Appendix, No. XIV. 



I'AKi 11.] THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 505 

have received from my countrymen, increases with eve- 
ry review of the momentous contest. 

While I repeat my obligations to the army in gen- 
eral, I should do injustice to my own feelings not to 
acknowledge, in this place, the peculiar services and 
distinguished merits of the gentlemen, who have been 
attached to my person during the wai-. It was impos- 
sible that the choice of confidential olliccrs to com- 
pose my family should have been more fortunate. Per- 
mit me. Sir, to recommend m particular those, who 
have continued in service to the present moment, as 
worthy of the favorable notice and patronage of Con- 
gress. 

I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last 
solemn act of my official hfe, by commending the in- 
terests of our dearest country to the protection of Al- 
mighty God, and those who have the superintendence 
of them to his holy keeping. 

Having now finished the work assigned me, I re- 
tire from the great dicatre of acdon ; and, bidding an 
affectionate farewell to this august body, under whose 
orders I have so long acted, I here offer my commis- 
sion, and take my leave of all the employments of 
public life.

.M.^RCH OF THE DETACHMENT UNDER THE MARQUIS 
DE LAIAVETTE TO VIRGINIA. 

The orii^inal object of the detachment to Virginia, under the 
Marquis de Lafayette, was, in conjunction wiili Baron Steuben, com- 
manding in that State, to cooperate with M. de Tilly's French 
squadron for the purpose of capturing Arnold and the British forces 
in the Chesapeake. Activity and despatch were essenti:d to the 
success of the enterprise. In this respect Lafayette was so fortu- 
nate in his march from the North River, although at an unfavorable 
season for military movements, that he arrived with his troops at the 
Head of Elk on the ^d of March, being three or four days earlier 
than had been anticipated. He there received information from the 
Commander-in-chief, that the squadron under M. de Tilly had re- 
turned to Newport, but tliat another naval detachment would be 
sent from that place by M. Destouches to cooperate with the land 
forces in the Chesapeake. 

As nothing could be done till this squadron should arrive in the 
Bay, Lafayette resolved to transport his troops to Annapolis, leave 
them there, and proceed in person to the head-quarters of Baron 
Steul)en, where he would be able to ascertain in the shortest time 
the arrival of the French vessels, and be prepared for ordering 
his troops immediately down the Bay. 

LAFAYETTE TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

" Williamsburg, 23 March, 1781. 
" My dear General, 

" By former letters your Excellency has been ac<iuainted with my 

motions, from my arrival at the Head of Elk to the time of my 

landing at this place. The march of the detachment to Elk had 



510 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

been very rapid, and performed in the best order. Owing to the 
activity of Lieutenant-Colonel Stevens, a train of artillery had been 
provided at Philadelphia ; and, notwithstanding some disappoint- 
ments, particularly that relating to the want of vessels, no delay 
should have been imputed to us in this cooperation. 

" Having received your letter, by which the sailing of the French 
fleet became a matter of certainty, I determined to transport the 
detachment to Annapolis, and did it for many essential reasons. 
The navigation of the Bay is such, that the going in and out of 
Elk River requires a different wind from that which is fair for go- 
ing up and down the Bay. Our stopping at Annapolis, and making 
some preparations on the route to Carolina, might be of use to de- 
ceive-the enemy ; but, above all, I thought with your Excellency, 
that it was important both to the success of the operation and the 
honor of our arms, that the detachment might be down to coop- 
erate ; and, from the time when the French were to sail, and the 
winds that blew for some days, I had no doubt that our allies would 
be in the Chesapeake before we could arrive at Annapolis. 

" Owing to the good dispositions of Commodore Nicholson, whom 
I requested to take charge of our small fleet, the detachment was 
safely lodged in the harbour of Annapolis ; and, in the conviction 
that my presence here was necessary, not so much for preparations 
(which Baron Steuben provided), as for settling our plans with the 
French, and obtaining an immediate convoy for the detachment, 
I thought it better to run some personal risk, than to neglect any 
thing that could forward the success of the operation, and the glory 
of the troops under my command. 

" On my arrival at this place, I was surprised to hear, that no 
French fleet had appeared, but attributed it to delays and chances 
so frequent in naval battles. My first object was to request, that 
nothing should be taken for this expedition, which could have been 
intended for, or useful to, the southern army, whose welfare ap- 
peared to me more interesting than our success. My second ob- 
ject was, to examine what had been prepared, to gather and for- 
ward every requisite for a vigorous cooperation ; and, besides a 
number of militia that would have amounted to five thousand, I 
can assure you, that nothing would have been wanting to ensure 
a complete success. 

" As the position of the enemy had not yet been reconnoitred, 
I went to General Muhlenberg's camp near Suffolk ; and, after he 
had taken a position nearer to Portsmouth, we marched down with 
some troops to view the enemy's works. This brought on a trifling

sklniii.sli, (luriiiir vvhicli wc were enabled to sec- MOiiiclliing ; but the 
insutlieiency of niniiuinition, which had been ex[)cctcd for many 
days, prevented my eni;aging lo<j far tri push the enemy's out-[X)Sls, 
and our reconnoitring was [Kistjioned to the ~lst. But, on the 
UOth, Major McPhcrson, an ollicer for whom I have tlie highest 
conlidence and esteem, sent me word from Hampton, where he was 
stationed, tliat a Heel had come to anchor within the Capes. So 
far was it proi)abU', thai this Hect was that of M. Ucstouches, that 
Arnold himsell" appeared to be in great contusion, and his vessels, 
notwithstanding many signals, durst not for a long time venture 
down. An ollicer ol" the French navy bore down lo iheni from 
York, and nothing could equal my surprise on hearing from Major 
McPhcrson, that the fleet announced by a former letter certainly 
belonged to the enemy. 

"Upon this intelligence, (lie militia were removed to their former 
position, and I reipiested Baron Steuben (from whom out of deli- 
cacy 1 would not take the command, until the cooperation was be- 
gun, or the Continental troops arrived,) to take such measures as 
would put out of the enemy's reach the several articles that had 
been prepared. On my return to this place, I could not hear more 
particular accounts of the fleet. Some people think they have 
come from Europe, but I believe them to be the fleet from Gardi- 
ner's Bay. They are said to be twelve sail in all, frigates in- 
cluded. I have sent spies on bo.ird, and shall forward their re- 
port to head-quarters. 

" Having certain accounts that the French sailed on the 8th, 
with a favorable wind, I must think that they are coming to this 
place, or were beaten in an engagement, or are gone somewhere 
else. In either of these three cases, I think it my duty to stay 
here until I hear something more, which must be in a little time. 
But, as you will certainly recall a detachment composed of the 
flower of each regiment, whose lo.ss would be immense for the ar- 
my under your immediate command, and as my instructions are to 
march them back as soon as we lose the naval superiority in this 
quarter, I have sent them orders to move at the first notice from 
me (which I will send to-mr.rrow or the day after), or upon the ar- 
rival of a letter from your Excellency, which my aid-de-camp is 
empowered to open. Had I not been on the spot, I am sure that 
I should have waited a long time before I should have known what 
to think of lliis fleet, and my presence at ihis place was the speedi- 
est means of forwarding the detachment, either to Hampton, or 
back lo your Excellency's immediate army." 



512 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

Soon after writing this letter, Lafayette returned to Annapolis, 
and proceeded thence with his troops to the Head of Elk. 

LAFAYETTE TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

"Head of Elk, 8 April, 1781. — Your E.^cellency's letters of 
the 5th and 6th instant have just come to hand ; and, before I an- 
swer their contents, I beg leave to give you a summary account 
of the measures I have lately taken. As to the part of my con- 
duct you have been acquainted with, I am happy, my dear Gen- 
eral, to find that it has met with your approbation. 

" When the return of the British fleet put it out of doubt, that 
nothing could be, undertaken for the present against Portsmouth, 
I sent pressing orders to Annapolis, in order to have every thing in 
readiness, and even to move the troops by land to the Head of 
Elk. I hastened back to Maryland ; but I confess I could not re- 
sist the ardent desire I have long had of seeing your relations, and 
above all your mother, at Fredericksburg. For that purpose I went 
some miles out of the way ; and, in order to conciliate my private 
happiness to duties of a public nature, I recovered, by riding in the 
night, those few hours, which I had consecrated to my satisfaction. 
I had also the pleasure of seeing Mount Vernon, and was very un- 
happy that my duty and my anxiety for the execution of your or- 
ders prevented my paying a visit to Mr. Custis. 

" On my arrival at Annapolis, I found that our preparations were 
far from promising a speedy departure. The difficulty of getting 
wagons and horses is immense. There are not boats sufficient to 
cross over the ferries. The State were very desirous of keeping us 
as long as possible, as they were scared by the apparition of the 
Hope, of twenty guns, and the Monk, of eighteen guns, which 
blockaded the harbour, and which, as appeared from intercepted 
letters, were determined to oppose our movements. In these cir- 
cumstances, I thought it better to continue my preparations for a 
journey by land, which, I am told, would have lasted ten days on 
account of ferries ; and, in the mean while, I had two eighteen- 
pounders put on board a small sloop, which appeared ridiculous to 
some, but proved to be of great service. 

" On the morning of the Gth, Commodore Nicholson went out 
with the sloop, and another vessel full of men. Whether the sound 
of eighteen-pounders, or the fear of being boarded, operated upon 
the enemy, I am not able to say ; but, after some manoeuvres, they 
retreated so far as to render it prudent for us to sail for this place. 



Appendix.] LAFAYETTE IN VIRGINIA. 513 

Ei'cry vessel with troops and horses came here in the night with 
the Commodore, to whom I am vastly obliged ; and, having brought 
up the rear with the sloop and another vessel, I arrived this morn- 
ing at KIk. It is reported, that the ships have returned to their 
station, if it is so, they must have been reinforced, and their com- 
mander had already applied for an augmentation of force." 

Lafayette had scarcely landed at the Head of Elk, when he re- 
ceived directions from Washington to march with his detachment 
to the south, and put himself under the orders of General Greene. 
As the men were mostly from the north, and had expected but a 
short absence from the main army, and were also clad in winter 
clothing, which was now becoming oppressive to them on account 
of the increa.sing warmth of the season, they were extremely re- 
luctant to return to the south; and it required no common share of 
good management to reconcile them to such a movement. This 
was effected, however, with so much promptitude and prudence, 
that, four days at\er the arrival of the troops at the Head of Elk, 
they commenced their march by land, and on the 13th of April 
crossed the Susquehanna on their route to Baltimore. Many incon- 
veniences were experienced, and some delay was occasioned, by the 
want of supplies and other aids for such a march. The privations 
and disappointment of the troops caused disquietude and desertions. 
These formidable obstacles were at length happily overcome by the 
address and fertile resources of the commander, as will appear 
from the following details. 

L.IF.WETTE TO GE.VER.\L WASHIXGTO.V. 

"Baltimore, 13 April, 1781. — Every one of my letters has 
been written in so lamentable a tone, that I am happy to give you 
a pleasanter prospect. The anxiety I feel to relieve your mind 
from a small part of those many solicitudes and cares, which our 
circumstances conspire to gather upon you, is the reason of my 
sending this letter by the chain,* and with a particular recom- 
mendation. 

" When I left Susquehanna Ferry, it was the general opinion, 
that we could not have six hundred men by the time we should ar- 
rire at our destination. This, and the shocking situation of the 
men, afforded the more gloomy prospects, as the Board of War 
have confessed their total inability to afford us relief. Under these 
circumstances, I have employed every personal exertion, and have

514 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

the pleasure to inform yoii, that I hope an end has been put to 
desertion. 

" On my arrival on this side of the Susquehanna, I issued an 
order to the troops, wlierein I endeavoured to tlirow a kind of 
infamy upon desertion, and particularly to influence their affec- 
tions. Since that, desertion has been lessened. Two deserters 
have been taken up, one of whom is hanged to-day, and the other 
(being an excellent soldier) will be forgiven, but dismissed from the 
corps, as well as another soldier, who behaved amiss. To these 
measures I have added one, which my feelings for the sufferings 
of the soldiers, and the peculiarity of their circumstances, have 
prompted me to adopt. 

" The merchants of Baltimore have lent me a sum of about two 
thousand pounds, which will procure some shirts, linen over-alls, 
shoes, and a few hats. The ladies will make up the shirts, and the 
over-alls will be made by the detachment, so that our soldiers have 
a chance of being a little more comfortable. The money is lent 
upon my credit, and I become security for the payment in two 
years' time, when, by the French laws, I may better dispose of my 
estate. But before that time I am to use my influence with the 
French court, in order to have as soon as possible this sum of 
money added to any loan Congress will have been able to obtain 
from them. 

" In case you are told, my dear General, that my whole bag- 
gage has been taken in the Bay, I am sorry I cannot discounte- 
nance the report ; but, when the mention of papers and maps shall 
be made, do not apprehend any thing bad to my papers, nor to the 
maps you have put in my possession. Nothing has been lost but 
writing-paper and printed maps. The fact is this. When at York, 
I had some Continental soldiers and my baggage to send up in a 
safe barge and an unsafe boat. I of course gave the barge to the 
soldiers, who lately went to Annapolis. The baggage was put into 
the boat, and has not been since heard of; but, being aware of the 
danger, I took with me by land every article, that, on the public 
account, was in the least valuable. 

" By a letter from Baron Steuben, dated Chesterfield Court- 
House, the lOth of April, I find that General Phillips has at Ports- 
mouth fifteen hundred or two thousand men added to the force 
under Arnold. Proper allowance being made for exaggerations, I 
apprehend that his whole army amounts to two thousand five hun- 
dred men, which obliges me to hasten my march to Fredericksburg 
and Richmond, where I expect to receive orders from General 



Ai-1'KNuix.] LAFAYETTE IN VIRGINIA. T) 1 5 

Greene. The importance of celerity, the desire of lengthening the 
way lioiiip, mid iiiiineiisie dciiiys that would stup tiie for an agi', have 
determined nie to leave our tents and artillery un<ler a guard, with 
or<lers to follow as fast as possible ; while the rest of the detach- 
ment, by forced marches, and with impressed wagons and horses, 
will ha.sten to Fredericksburg or Richmond, and thus derange the 
calculations of the enemy. We shall set olV to-morrow, and this 
rapid mode of travelling, added to my other precautions, wUl, I 
hope, keep up our spirits and satisfaction. With the highest re- 
spect, and tender afiection, I have the honor to be, tSdc. 

" P. S. The word lessened docs not convey a sufficient idea of 
what experience has proved to be true, to the honor of our excel- 
lent soldiers. It had been announced in general orders, that the 
detachment was intended to fight an enemy far superior in num- 
bers, under difficulties of every sort ; that the general was for his 
part determined to encounter them, but that such of the soldiers, as 
had an inclination to abandon him, might dispense with the dan- 
gers and crime of desertion, as every one of them, who should ap- 
ply to head-quarters for a pass to join their corps in the north, 
should be sure to obtain it immediately." 

" Alriandria, 23 April, 1781. — With the help of some wagons 
and horses, we got in two days from the camp near Baltimore to 
this place. We halted yesterday, and, having made a small bar- 
gain for a few shoes, are marching to Fredericksburg. No official 
account from Phillips, but I am told they are removing stores from 
Richmond and Petersburg. I am surprised nobody writes to me ; 
and hope soon to receive intelligence. Our men are in high 
spirits ; their honor having been interested in this affair, they have 
made it a point to come with us, and discontent as well as de- 
sertion is entirely out of fashion. 

" The Chevalier de la Luzerne writes to me, that Count de Ro- 
chambeau is going to join you, so that both armies will cooperate. 
I had rather remain in Virginia than go to Carolina. This I 
mention because orders are to come from General Greene ; but if 
the detachment is to go more southerly, I will get there as fast 
as I can." 

By a rapid march from Alexandria, Lafayette arrived with his 
detachment at Richmond on the 29th of April, where he was 
joined by the Continental troops under Baron Steuben and Gen- 
eral Muhlenberg, and the Virginia militia commanded by General 
Nelson. 

" He conducted the campaign," says Mr. Everett, " with a vigor,

discretion, and success, which saved the State of Virginia, and 
proved himself to be endowed with the highest qualities of gen- 
eralship. While Lord Cornwallis, to whom he was opposed, a per- 
son not less eminent for talent and experience, than for rank and 
political influence, was boasting, in derision of his youthful ad- 
versary, that ' the boy should not escape him,' the boy was pre- 
paring a pit, into which his Lordship plunged with all his forces. 
" My limits do not allow me to sketch to you the history of this 
great campaign, nor even of its final glorious consummation, the 
closing scene of the war. But I may, with propriety, pause to say, 
that it evinced on the part of our venerable Washington, now at 
length favored with an opportunity of acting with ample means on 
a broad scale, a power of combination and a reach of mind, with 
a promptitude and vigor of execution, which, exhibited at the head 
of mighty armies, gave to Napoleon his reputation, as the greatest 
captain of the age. I cannot but think, that, in the manoeuvres by 
which Lord Cornwallis was detained in Virginia, by which Sir 
Henry Clinton was persuaded in New York, that a siege of that 
city was the great object of Washington, by which the French 
forces were brought up from Rhode Island, the armies of Wash- 
ington and Rochambeau moved by a forced march across the 
country to Yorktown, at the moment that the French squadron 
from Newport under the Count de Barras, and the great fleet un- 
der the Count de Grasse, effected their junction in the Chesapeake, 
there is displayed as much generalship, as in any series of move- 
ments in the wars of the last thirty years. The operations of La- 
fayette in Virginia in the preceding summer were the basis of 
them all ; as his untiring efforts in France, the preceding season, 
had mainly occasioned the despatch of the army of Count de Ro- 
chambeau, without which the great exploit at Yorktown could not 
have been achieved." — Everett's Eulogy on Lafayette, p. 31.

SUBST.\NCE OF A CONFERENCE BETWEEN GENERAL WASH- 
INGTON AND COUNT UE ROCHAMUEAU AT WEATHERS- 
FIELD, MAY 22, 1781. 

The object of the interview at Wenthersfield, between the Amer- 
ican and French conimandcrs, was to concert a plan of operations 
for the campaign. Facts and propositions were stated by Count 
de Rochambeau, in the form of queries, whicli were answered by 
General Wa.shinirion, with such remarks as the topics suggested. 

Kocn.\MnK.4i-.— Concerning a project of employing the squad- 
ron at Newport to transport the French army to the Chesapeake 
Bay, ho consulted Count do Barras, who deemed it impractica- 
ble, chielly on account of the inferiority of his naval force to that 
of the enemy. The objections were mentioned in detail." 

W.\SHiN(iTO.\. — "However desirable such an event might have 
been, the reasons assigned by Count de Barras are sufficient to 
prove its impracticability." 

RocH.\.Mi!F..\i-. — Should the French army march to the North 
River, will the squadron be safe at Newport under a guard of 
militia ! By his secret instructions he is not permitted to sepa- 
rate his army, except for detachments of a short duration. Count 
de Barras thinks the squadron would not be secure, if the enemy 
should take possession of Rhode Island ; and, moreover, he has 
been instructed, that, in case the army should march into the 
country, his fleet should proceed to Boston. 

\V.\sui.NT,TON. — "It is General Washington's opinion, that the 
plan of the campaign will render it necessary for the French ar- 
my to march from Newport towards the North River as soon as 
possible, and that consequently it will be advisable for the Count 
de Barras (agreeably to his instructions in that case provided) to 
seek the first favorable moment of removing the squadron under 
his command to Boston." 

Rocii.vMnF.AU. — In that case what does General Washington 
propose about Rhode Island ? Does he intend it should be kept 
by a general officer and a body of American militia ? It is to be 
observed, that, if in the hurricane months the French fleet should 
come to the coast, the harbour of Rhode Island might be of use

to the operations of the squadrons, either for a union to act against 
New York, or as a place of retreat in case of misfortune. 

Washington. — "As the harbour of Rhode Island may be use- 
ful to the fleets of his Most Christian Majesty, it is General Wash- 
ington's opinion, that a force should be left for the security of 
Newport ; but, as the enemy will not be in a condition, from the 
present circumstances of their affairs, to detach any considerable 
body of men to repossess the Island, it is agreed between Count 
de Rochambeau and General Washington, that five hundred mili- 
tia under a good officer will be sufficient as a guard for the 
works ; but, in case of an enterprise against them, a greater force 
should be called in for their defence." 

Rochambeau. — If General Washington resolves that Rhode 
Island shall be left, and the works destroyed, does he consider 
the siege artillery, powder, magazines, and heavy stores, which 
cannot follow the French army in a land march, as safe at Provi- 
dence under two hundred French troops and the militia? For 
such an object the English may attempt an enterprise to seize 
these stores. Would they not be more secure, if taken with the 
fleet to Boston ? 

Washington. — "In the former communications between Count 
de Rochambeau and General Washington, it was understood, that 
the French fleet was to remain in the harbour of Newport after 
the removal of the army ; and therefore Providence was fixed up- 
on as a safe and proper deposit for the heavy artillery and spare 
stores. It now being determined, that the fleet shall embrace the 
first opportunity of going round to the harbour of Boston, it is to 
be wished, that the heavy artillery and spare stores should be sent 
round also. But, General Washington being informed by Count 
de Rochambeau, that they have been already deposited at Provi 
dence, and that it will be impossible, under the present circum- 
stances of the fleet and want of transportation, to remove them 
to Boston, he is of opinion, that they may safely remain there un- 
der the guard of two hundred French troops, who will be aided 
by the militia of the country in case of need. The possession of 
Newport will add to their security."

visable to form a junction of the French and American armies 
upon the North River, as soon as possible, and move down to 
the vicinity of New York, to be ready to lake advantage of any 
opporliniity, which the weakness of the enemy may alFord. Should 
the West India fleet arrive upon the coast, the force thus com- 
bined may cither proceed in the operation against New York, or 
may be directed against the enemy in some other i]uarter, as cir- 
cumstances shall dictate. The great waste of men, which we 
have found front ex|)crience in the long marches to the southern 
States, the advanced season in which such a march must be 
commenced, and the dilhcuities and expense of land transporta- 
tion thither, with other considerations too well known to Count 
de llochambeau to need detailing, point out the preference, which 
an operation against New York seems to have in the present cir- 
cumstances over an attempt to send a force to the soutliward."

EXTRACTS FROM INTERCEPTED LETTERS WRITTEN BY 
LORD GEORGE GERMAIN TO SIR HENRY CLINTON.' 

Whitehall, 7 February, 1781. 

— It gives his Majesty particular satisfaction to find, that you had 
determined to replace Major-General Leslie's detachment in Eliza- 
beth River by one under Brigadier-General Arnold, with positive 
orders to establish a permanent post there. I learn with great 
pleasure from private letters of the ~'2i\ of December, that you 
were preparing a very considerable body of troops for immediate 
embarkation, which I flatter myself, from an expression in one of 
your letters to Vice-Admiral Arbuthnot, will be employed in con- 
junction with the Loyal As.sociators of Maryland and Pcnnsvlvania, 
in reducing those provinces to the King's obedience, while Lord 
Cornwallis and Brigadier-General Arnold subdue Virginia ; for such 
is bcvDiid all doubt the low condition of the Congress's authority 
and fmances, and so weak is the state of ^Vashington's army, that 

" The lelter«, from which these extracts are taken, were captured at sea on 
board a packet ship from Falmouth, and were traHBinilled to Congress.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Afpe.ndix. 



little oppositioa is to be expected in that quarter, and none that 
can resist such a force as, without the least hazard to New York 
or Charleston, may be assembled there. You were perfectly rio-ht 
in your interpretation of the Vice-Admiral's orders for detaching five 
ships to the West Indies, and I was happy to find he acquiesced 
in your judgment upon that occasion. 

The return of the people of Vermont to their allegiance is an 
event of the utmost importance to the King's affairs, and at this 
time, if the French and Washington really meditate an irruption 
into Canada, may be considered as opposing an insurmountable bar 
to the attempt. General Haldimand, who had the same instruc- 
tions with you to draw over those people, and give them support, 
will, 1 doubt not, push up a body of troops to act in conjunction 
with them to secure all the avenues from their country into Canada, 
and, when the season admits, take possession of the upper parts 
of Hudson and Connecticut Rivers, and cut oil" the communication 
between Albany and tiie Mohawk country. How far they may be 
able to extend themselves to the- southward and eastward, must de- 
pend upon their number and the disposition of the inliabitants ; 
but, if Albany should take part with them, the inducement to at- 
tempt to open a communication with them by Hudson's River will 
appear irresistible to people here. 

I am sorry I cannot inform you, that the transports with the re- 
cruits are sailed from Cork, where the three regiments are in readi- 
ness to join them, but a long continuance of easterly winds first 
prevented the ships from getting round to Portsmouth, and now the 
westerly winds detain them there ; but they are all at Spithead with 
their convoy, ready to put to sea the moment the wind will permit 
them to sail. The ordnance store-ship, which has five thousand 
stands of arms on board for Carolina, being still in the river, I 
have ordered three thousand stands to be sent by land-carriage to 
Portsmouth, and there distributed on board the transports, as 1 
understand they are much wanted among the loyalists. They are 
addressed to the commander of the forces in South Carolina. 



Wlnteliall, 7 March, I7S1. 
Sir, 

Since my letter to you of the Tth of February, I have received 
your despatches, and laid them before the King. 

The revolt of the Pennsylvania line and Jersey brigade, though 
not attended with all the good consequences that might have been 
expected, are certainly events of very great importance, and must

have vcrv extensive effects, Ixith in reducing Washington's present 
force, and preventing its l)cing recruited by new levies ; and, as I 
douitt not you will avail yourself of his weakness, and your own 
great su|K'riority, to send a considerate force to the head of the 
Chesapeake as soon as the season will permit operations to be car- 
ried on in that quarter, I flatter myself the southern provinces will 
be recovered to his Majesty's ol>edience before the long promised 
succours, none of which are yet sailed, can arrive from France ; 
and that Mr. Washington, unable to draw subsistence for his troops 
from the west side of Hudson's River, will be compelled to cross 
it and take refuge in the eastern provinces. 

I am very anxious to hear of Lord Cornwailis's progress since 
General Leslie joined him. I have no doubt his movements will 
bo rapid and decisive, for his Lordship appears to be fully impressed 
with llie absolute necessity of vigorous exertions in the service of 
this country in its present circumstances. The success of Gen- 
eral Arnold's enterprise up James River, which the rebel news- 
papers confirm, must greatly facilitate his Lordship's operations, by 
cutting off Greene's supplies and obliging the militia to return to 
take care of their own property. Indeed, so very contemptible is 
the rebel force now in all parts, and so vast is our superiority every- 
where, that no resistance on their part is to be apprehended, that 
can materially obstruct the progress of the King's arms in the speedy 
suppression of the rebellion ; and it is a pleasing, though at the 
same time a mortifying reflection, when the duration of the rebel- 
lion is considered, which arises from a view of the returns of the 
provincial forces you have transmitted, that the American levies in 
the Kinc's service arc more in number, than the whole of the en- 
listed troops in the service of the Congress. 

I am very glad to find you have commissioned a Board of Di- 
rectors of the Refugees, and I hope the admiral will have been able 
to spare them shipping to carry on their operations on the seacoast 
of the New England provinces. Many of those within the lines, 
who are unfit for military service, are desirous of being settled in 
the country about Penobscot, and require only to be supplied with 
provisions for the first year, some tools for husbandry, and iron- 
work for their buildings ; and, as it is proposed to settle that coun- 
try, and this appears a cheap method of disposing of these loyalists, 
it is wished you would encourage them to go there under the pro- 
tection of the A.ssociated Refugees, and assure them that a civil 
government will follow I hem in due time ; for I hope, in the course 
of the summer, the admiral and you will be able to spare a force

sufficient to effect an establishment at Casco Bay, and reduce that 
country to the King's obedience. 

I am very glad to find, by the list of the officers released, that 
the exchanges have been carried so far ; but, as it appears from 
Mr. Washington's last letter to you, that they will not be carried 
on further, the measure of enlisting their prisoners for service in 
the West Indies should be adopted immediately ; and, indeed, such 
has been the mortality from sickness among the troops there, that 
I do not see any other means of recruiting them. 

I am sorry to acquaint you, that the general prevalence of 
westerly winds for these last two months has prevented the War- 
wick and Solebay, with their convoy, from getting further than 
Plymouth, where they are still detained. —

LETTER FROM COUNT DE URASSE TO 
C O U iN T D E R C H A M B E A U . 



At the Cape (St. Domingo), 8 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have seen with regret the distress, which prevails on the con- 
tinent, and the necessity of the prompt succours you solicit. 1 
have conferred with M. de Lillancourt, who took command of the 
government here on the day of my arrival, and engaged him to 
furnish from the garrison of St. Domingo a detachment from the 
regiments of Gatinois, Agenois, and Tourraine, amounting in all to 
three thousand men, one hundred artillery, one hundred dragoons, 
ten pieces of field ordnance, and several of siege artillery and mor- 
tars. The whole will be embarked in vessels of war, from twenty- 
five to twenty-nine in number, which will depart from this colony 
on the 13th of August, and proceed directly to the Chesapeake 
Bay, which place seems to be indicated by yourself, General Wash- 
ington, M. de la Luzerne, and Count de Barras, as the best point 
of operation for accomplishing the object proposed. 

I have likewise done all in my power to procure for you the 
sum of twelve hundred thousand livre.s, which you say is abso- 
lutely necessary. This colony is not in a condition to afford you 
such a supply ; but I shall obtain it from Havana, whither a frig- 



AirtM.i\.l t'AI'TAlN AFFLECK. ^i'-i'-i 

ate will be sent fur llio |nir(M)s<', aiid yoii in.iy depend on receiv- 
ing that amount. 

As neither mysell", nor the troops commanded by the Marquis 
dc St. Simon, can remain on the continent after the l.jtli of Oc- 
tober, I shall be greatly obliged to you if you will employ mo 
promptly and etFecttially within that time, whether against the 
maritime or land forces of our enemy. It will not be possible for 
me to leave the troo|>s with you beyond that period ; fir.-it, because 
part of them are under the orders of the Spanish generals, and 
have been obtained only on the promise, that they shall be re- 
turned by the time they will be wanted ; and, secondly, because 
the other part are destined to the garrison of St. Domingo, and 
cannot be spared from that duty by M. de Lillancourt. The en- 
tire expedition, in regard to these trcxjps, has been concerted only 
in consequence of your request, without even the previous knowl- 
edge of the ministers of France and Spain. I have thought myself 
authorized to assume this responsibility for the common cause ; but 
I should not dare so far to change the plans they have adopted, 
as to remove so considerable a body of troops. 

You clearly perceive the necessity of making the best use of 
the time, that will remain for action. I hope the frigate, which 
takes this letter, will have such despatch, that every thing may be 
got in readiness by the time of my arrival, and that we may pro- 
ceed immediately to fulfil the designs in view, the success of 
which I ardently desire. I have the honor to be, &c.

LETTER FROM CAPTAIN AFFLECK TO GENERAL WASH- 
LNGTON RESPECTLNG MARINE PRISONERS. 

New York, 30 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I intend not either to deny or to assert, for it will neither fa- 
cilitate business nor alleviate distress. The subject of your letter 
seems to turn upon two points, namely, the inconveniences and 
distresses, which the American prisoners suffer from the inade- 
quacy of room in the prison-ships, which occasions the death of 
many of them, as you are told ; and that a commi.ssary-general 



524 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



of prisoners from you shall have liberty to visit the ships, inspect 
the situation of the prisoners, and make a report from an actual 
survey. 

I take leave to assure you, that I feel for the distresses of man- 
kind as much as any man ; and, since my coming to the naval 
command in this department, one of my principal endeavours has 
been to regulate the prison and hospital ships. The government 
having made no other provision for naval prisoners than shipping, 
it is impossible that the greater inconvenience, which people con- 
fined on board ships experience beyond those confined on shore, 
can be avoided, and a sudden accumulation of people often ag- 
gravates the evil. But I assure you, tliat every attention is shown 
that is possible, and that the prison-ships are under the very same 
regulations here, that have been constantly observed towards the 
prisoners of all nations in Europe. Tables of diet are publicly af- 
fixed, officers visit every week, redress and report grievances, and 
the numbers are thinned as they can provide shipping, and no at- 
tention has been wanting. 

The latter point cannot be admitted in its full extent ; but, if 
you think fit to send an officer of character to the lines for that 
purpose, he will be conducted to me, and he shall be accompa- 
nied by an officer, and become a witness of the manner in which 
we treat the prisoners. And I shall expect to have my officer 
visit the prisoners detained in your jails and dungeons in like 
manner, as well as in the mines, where I am informed many an 
unhappy victim languishes out his days. I must remark, had 
Congress ever been inclined, they might have contributed to re- 
lieve the distresses of those we are under the necessity of hold- 
ing as prisoners, by sending in all in their possession towards the 
payment of the large debt they owe us on that head, which might 
have been an inducement towards liberating many now in cap- 
tivity. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, with due respect, &,c.

L i; r T E R S K II O M COUNT D E V E II G E N N E S TO 
THE .MA II QUI 3 DE LAFAYETTE. 

Venuiillcs, 10 March, 1761. 
Sir, 

I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to write 
to me on the Kith of last December, and have deferred answer- 
ing it, because the subject required delil)eralii)iis, which we have 
been obliged from various circumstances to delay. 

The Kinc; ha.s just determined on the succours of different kinds, 
with which the Americans are to be rurnishcd for the ensuing 
campaign. I ."hall not give you a detailed account of them, as I 
am transmitting one to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, who, I have 
no doubt, will comnuniicatc it to you.* I have reason to believe, 
that Uener.il Washington will be satisfied with our efforts for the 
support of the American cause, and that, on his part, he will do ev- 
ery thing in his power to render them available. I beg that you 
will a.Hsure him of the entire confidence, which we place in his 
zeal, patriotism, and talents, and that we shall sincerely rejoice 
when he shall have acquired the glory of having delivered his 
country and secured her liberties. 

I hope that the disturbance in the American army has been en- 
tirely quelled, as a renewal of the scenes .icted in the Pennsylvania 



* .Among oilier aids for the year 17dl, the Flench King resolved to grant to 
the United States a subsidy of six millions of livre^. The ministry, designing 
tliis money for a special succour to the army, proposed, that, alter a certain 
portion had been paid for military articles purchased in Europe, the remainder 
should be at the disposal of General Washington, and disbursed in such a 
manner as he should think best for the general good. This idea was ex- 
presiscd lo Dr. Franklin, and he communicated it to Congress. The jealousy 
and fears of that body were immediately alarmed. They were not satisfied that 
the head of the army should possess such an agent, in addition to his military 
power. M. de la Luzerne was at first a little concerned .it this uneasines.s, as 
it was mingled with latent suspicions of the design of the French court, in 
nuking this disposition of the money ; but luckily he discovered in Tounl de 
VergenncsB letter to him, that General Washington, " or some other person," 
was indicated. He immediately removed the anxieties of Congress by com- 
municating this fact, and informing them that the money was within Iheir 
control. Not long afterwards he saw General Washington, who thanked him 
cordially for his interference, and for thus relieving him from a very respon- 
sible task, which he had no desire to perform, and which would excite the 
jealousy of his enemies.

line would be very dangerous, and would probably frustrate the 
most vigorous and best concerted plans. Clotliing tor your troops 
will arrive, and 1 trust you will also receive a further supply. This 
article appears to me tlie most important, as well as the most ur- 
gent. I have the honor to be, &.c. 

Vergennes. 

Versailles, liJ April, 1781. 
Sir, 

Your description of the situation of the Americans is very dis- 
tressing, and, from the previous accounts of the Chevalier de la 
Luzerne, we have felt the immediate necessity of affording them 
further assistance. You may confide to General Washington, that 
the King has determined to pledge himself for a loan of ten mil- 
lions, which is about to be negotiated in Holland in favor of the 
United States. Thus, Sir, by the close of this year, his Majesty 
will have given, or lent to the Americans, the sum of twenty mil- 
lions. I venture to believe, that the General will feel the extent 
and importance of such a service, especially when he takes into 
consideration, as he should do, the maintenance of a squadron and 
a body of troops, which the King has placed at his disposal, and the 
heavy expenses of a war, which we sustain only for the sake of the 
Americans, 

Congress had fixed their wants and their demands at twenty-five 
millions. I am willing to admit the correctness of this estimate ; 
but the King must consider, on his side, the compass of his means. 
You may easily conceive, that they are absorbed by the great ex- 
penses demanded by our efforts for the American cause. I beg you 
to impress on General Washington the force of this idea. He is 
too enlightened not to perceive it strongly, or to admit any other 
sentiments than those of gratitude. I have done all in my power to 
awaken these in his aid-de-camp, but without success. Mr. Lau- 
rens is not without zeal, but I confess that he has hardly manifested 
it in the manner required by his commission. We have taken no 
exception at it, because we have attributed the conduct of Mr. Lau- 
rens merely to his inexperience in affairs. I think it necessary to 
speak of this officer, because it is possible, that, displeased at not 
having obtained all that he demanded, or rather exacted, namely, 
arms, clothing, ammunition, and twenty-five millions besides, he 
may be somewhat partial in the account he gives to his General ; 
and I think it my duty to afford you the means of counteracting 
any prejudices, which he might receive from it. For the rest, 
Mr. Laurens has been well received by all the ministers of the 



AiMT.MMx.) VKRGKNNKS AND I, A F A V KTT K. 527 

King, ami I lM>lievc that he will in this respect express himself 
perfectly satisfied.* 

The ample supplies, with which the King fiiriiislios tiic Ameri- 
cans, authorize him to expect, that they will exert the greatest en- 
ergy ill the operations of the approaching campaign. I beg that 
you will mention to General Washington, that his Majesty has in 
this respect the greatest confidence in his experience, activity, and 
patriotism. I have nothing to add to the communications in my 
last li'ttiT concerning our operations. Our arrangements will re- 
main as I have transmitted them to the Chevalier de la Luzerne. 

Finally, Sir, if the war, as appears probable, is prolonged beyond 
the present campaign, I hope that we shall not be called on with 
similar demands. I forewarn you, that it would be iitiitf impossible 
to satisfy them. France is by no means an inexhaustible mine. 

I have the honor to be, &.c. 

Vergen.nes. 

Versailles, 11 May, 17S1. 
SiK, 

I had forgotten to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 
4th of last October. My letter of the 19th of April replies to nearly 
all the points on which it touches. Mr. Laurens is on the eve of 
his departure, lie has converted a part of the money, given by his 
Majesty, into arms, clothing, and ammunition. We are waiting the 
result of a loan of ten millions, negotiating in Holland. It cannot 
be obtained in the name of the Americans, and the King, to attain 
his desire of obliging them, has resolved to come forward as prin- 
cipal negotiator. I beg that you will acquaint General Washington 
with this circumstance. 

Notwithstanding the great efforts we are making for the United 
States, Mr. Laurens is not satisfied. This oliicer has treated me 
with great neglect since I announced to him the determination of 

■ The zeal of Colonel Laurens, and llie ardor of his character, induced him 
to press his demands with more pertinacity, and witfi less reaard to forms, 
than is usual in diplomatic intercourse. M de la Luzerne conversed with him 
on the subject after his return to .America. *' He appeared," said thiit minis- 
ter, '* to he itensible of his mistake, and said he was a soldier, lillle aerjuainted 
with the usages of courts, but warmly attached to bis country ; and that this 
sentiment may have led him beyond the bounds, which he ought to have pre* 
scribed to himself. He h.'is suffered none of the complaints to escape him 
here, in which he indulged at Paris." — MS. Letter from Luzerne to I'trgennts,

his Majesty. I know that his complaints have been highly indis- 
creet, and I apprehend that he will do every thing in his power to 
prejudice his General. I beg you to inform the latter of this, and 
to induce him to advise his aid-de-camp, and above all, to impress 
hira with the necessity of rendering to Congress the most exact ac- 
count of the mission in France, which has been confided to him. 
I trust that we shall not again receive similar messages. France is 
not inexhaustible, and it would be impossible to attend to them. 
We are doing much for the Americans, but they must also exert 
themselves. We are waiting with great impatience for news from 
your quarter. We have learnt as yet only by the English gazettes, 
that a naval combat has taken place off the Capes of Virginia ; but 
they do not mention whether our troops have disembarked, nor what 
has become of M. Destouches. It is affirmed, that you are block- 
aded at Annapolis by several frigates. I am very anxious to hear 
that this intelligence is without foundation, and that you have 
reached your destination in safety. Finally, 1 have nothing new to 
add to the information of my preceding letters, respecting the ope- 
rations of the ensuing campaign. God grant that the Americans 
may at length put forth all the energy of which they are capable. 
It will be the surest means of obtaining a speedy peace. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

LETTER FROM COUNT DE GRASSE TO GENERAL WASHING- 
TON, CONCERNING OPERATIONS IN THE CHESAPEAKE. 

Cape Henry, 2,3 September, 1781. 
Sir, 

The intelligence, which your Excellency has sent to me by the 
aid-de-camp of Count de Rochambcau, is most distressing. I know 
but little of the evil and the progress, which this operation may 
effect, but I perceive that our position is changed by the arrival 
of Admiral Digby. 

The enemy is now nearly equal to us in strength, and it would be 
imprudent in me to place myself in a situation, that would prevent 
my attacking them, should they attempt to afford succour. I have 
the honor, therefore, to propose to your Excellency that I should 
leave two vessels at the mouth of York River, and draw around me 



api'i:.m.ix.] count dk urasse. 529 

all the rest, excepting the corvettes and frigates, wiiich have been 
blockading Joincs River since my arrival, and wliicli are the Char- 
lotte, the Corinornnl, the Sandwich, and one other frigate. The 
rest I shall bring together, in order to sail and keep the sea, that in 
case the enemy attempt to force the passage, 1 may attack them in 
a less disadvantageous position. But it is possible, that the issue 
of the combat may force us to leeward, and dcjjrive us of the power 
of returning. Under these circumstances, what could you do, what 
would be your resources f I cannot sacrifice the army under my 
command, and my present position is neither favorable for attack- 
ing, nor secure in case of a gale. 

The anchorage at York, on which we were agreed, does not ap- 
pear more suitable, considering the maritime forces of the enemy ; 
because it would place me in a very unfavorable position, and would 
have no elFect in preventing the reinforcement from entering. I 
see no resource but the oiling, and possibly that may not leave me 
free to return within the Capes. I shall wait impatiently for your 
answer, and that of M. de Rochambeau, to whom this letter is 
addressed in common with you. I beg you to communicate it to 
him, and to .send your advice and opinions on the subject. 

If my troops, or those of M. de St. Simon, remain with you, the 
two vessels and the corvettes at James River will be sufficient for 
you. I will sail with my forces towards New York, and I may 
possibly do more for the common cause than by remaining here an 
idle spectator. If the enemy do not come out, it is evidently be- 
cause they dare not. We shall then consider what course to take. 
In the mean time you will push Cornwallis vigorously, and we will 
act in concert, each on his own side. I have the honor to be, 
with respectful consideration, &.c.

GeNER.\L WASHINGTON TO EARL COKNWALLIS. 

Camp, before York, 18 October, 17dl. 
.Mv Lord, 

To avoid unnecessary discussion and delays, 1 shall at once, 
in answer to your Lordship's letters of yesterday, declare the gen- 
eral basis upon which a definitive treaty and capitulation must take 
place. The garrisons of York and Gloucester, including the sea- 
men, as you propose, will be received prisoners of war. The con- 
dition annexed, of sending the British and German troops to the 
parts of Europe to which ihey respectively belong, is inadmissible. 
Instead of this, they will be marched to such parts of the country 
as can most conveniently provide for their subsistence ; and the 
benevolent treatment of prisoners, which is invariably observed by 
the Americans, will be extended to tlieni. The same honors will 
be granted to the surrendering army as were granteil to the gar- 
rison of Charleston. The shipping and boats in the two harbours, 
with all their guns, stores, tackling, furniture, and apparel, shall be 
delivered in their present state to an olFicer of the navy, appoint- 
ed to take possession of them. 

The artillery, arms, accoutrements, military chest, and public 
stores of every denomination, sh.ill be delivered unimpaired to the 
beads of the departments, to which they respectively belong. 

The officers will be indulged in retaining their side-arms ; and 
the officers and soldiers may preserve their baggage and effiicts ; 
with this reserve, that property taken in the country will be re- 
claimed. 

With regard to individuals in civil capacities, whose interest 
your Lordship wishes may be attended to, until they are more par- 
ticularlv described, nothing definitive can be settled. 

I have to add, that I expect the sick and wounded will be sup- 
plied with their own hospital stores, and be attended by British 
surgeons, particularly charged with the care of them. 



532 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

Your Lordship will be pleased to signify your determination, 
either to accept or reject the proposals now offered, in the course 
of two hours from the delivery of this letter, that commissioners 
may be appointed to digest the articles of capitulation, or a re- 
newal of hostilities may take place. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

George Washington. 

earl cornwallis to general washington. 

York, 18 October, 1781. 
Sir, 

I agree to open a treaty of capitulation upon the basis of the 
garrisons of York and Gloucester, including seamen, being pris- 
oners of war, without annexing the condition of their being sent to 
Europe ; but I expect to receive a compensation in the articles of 
capitulation for the surrender of Gloucester in its present state of 
defence. 

I shall in particular desire, that the Bonctta sloop-of-war may be 
left entirely at my disposal, from the hour that the capitulation is 
signed, to receive an aid-de-camp to carry my despatches to Sir 
Henry Clinton. Such soldiers as I may think proper to send as 
passengers in her, to be manned with fifty men of her own crew, 
and to be permitted to sail without examination, when my de- 
spatches are ready ; engaging on my part, that the ship shall be 
brought back and delivered to you, if she escapes the dangers of 
the sea, that the crew and soldiers shall be accounted for in future 
exchanges, that she shall carry off no officer without your consent, 
nor public property of any kind ; and I shall likewise desire, that 
the traders and inhabitants may preserve their property, and that no 
person may be punished or molested for having joined the British 
troops. 

If you choose to proceed to negotiation on these grounds, I shall 
appoint two field-officers of my army to meet two oilicers from you, 
at any time and place that you think proper, to digest the arti- 
cles of capitulation. I have the honor to be, &c. 

CORNWALLIS.* 



♦ Commissioners met accordingly, and arranged the articles of capitulation. 
Colonel Laurens and the Viscount de NoaiUes were the commissioners on the 
part of General Washington ; and Colonel Dundas and Major Ross, on that 
of Earl Cornwallis.

LETTERS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS FROM SIR GUY CARLETON 
TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 



Head-Quurters, New York, 7 May, 1762. 
Sir, 

Having been appointed by his Majesty to the command of the 
forces on the Atlantic Ocean, and joined with Admiral Digby in 
the commission of peace, I find it proper in this manner to apprize 
your Excellency of my arrival at New York. 

The occasion. Sir, seems to render this communication proper, 
but the circumstances of the present time render it also indispensa- 
ble ; as I find it just to transmit herewith to your Excellency cer- 
tain papers, from the perusal of which your Excellency will per- 
ceive what dispositions prevail in the government and people of 
England towards those of America, and what further effects are 
likely to follow. If the like pacific dispositions should prevail in 
this country, both my inclination and duty will lead me to meet it 
with tiie most zealous concurrence. In all events, Sir, it is with 
me to declare, that, if war must prevail I shall endeavour to render 
its miseries as light to the people of this continent, as the circum- 
stances of such a condition will possibly permit. 

I am much concerned to find, that private and unauthorized 
persons have on both sides given way to those passions, which 
ought to have received the strongest and most effectual control, and 



ApfEM.ix.] «1K eilJV CAKLETON. 5-^7 

whicli liave begot acts of retaliation, which, without proper preven- 
tions, may have an extent equally calamitous and dishonorable to 
both partiis, lliouijh, as it should seem, more extensively pernicious 
to the natives and settlers of this country. 

How much soever, Sir, we may dilVtr in oilier respects, upon tliis 
one i>oint we must perfectly concur, being alike interested to i)re- 
scrve the name of Knglishmen from reproach, and individuals from 
experiencing such unnecessary evils, as can have no eflect upon a 
general decision. Every proper measure, which may tend to pre- 
vent these criminal excesses in individuals, I shall ever be ready to 
embrace ; and, as an advance on my part, I have, as the first act of 
my counnand, enlarged Mr. Livingston,' and have written to his 
father upon the subject of such excesses as have passed in New 
Jersey, desiring his concurrence in such measures as, even under 
the conditions of war, the common interests of humanity require. 

I am further to acquaint you. Sir, that it wa.s my intention to 
have sent this day a similar letter of compliment to Congress, but 
am informed it is previously necessary to obtain a passport from 
your Excellency, which I therefore hope to receive, if you have no 
objection, tor the passage of iMr. Morgaim to Philadelplna for the 
above purpose. I have the honor to be, &-c. 

Guv Caiileton. 

Head-Quarlers, New York, 20 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of tlie lOth of 
Junet with two enclosures, containing the report of Chief Justice 
Brearley concerning the capture and detention of Hatfield and 
Badgely in New Jersey, and extracts of letters from your Excel- 
lency to Licutenant-Gcneral Robert.son, and from Governor Liv- 
ingston to you. 

Before I received your letter, I had written to Governor Liv- 
ingston concerning the detention of these men, as also of two 
others, who I am informed are lately condemned in New Jersey, 
upon some new provincial law of high treason, to suffer death, and 
even the day of their execution appointed. To this letter I have 

* Colonel Henry BrockhoUt Livingston, son of Governor Livingston of 
New Jersey. On his passage from Cadiz to America, he was captured by a 
British frigate, and brought into New York. 

I This letter was merely intended to communicate the enclosures, without 
expressing any opinion in regard to them. On thai head General Washing- 
ton referred to his letter to General Robertson, dated May 4th.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



as yet received no answer; but I trust it will be admitted, that 
executions upon this ground, whether with or without the tbruiali- 
ties of law, are measures of the most fatal extremity. In a civil 
war between people of one empire, there can, during the contest, 
be no treason at all ; or each party, assuming the other to be trai- 
tors, shall be able, by the same or different laws, some made even 
during the very contest, to elTect more carnage than by the sword, 
producing the most horrid refinements in ill, under the disguise 
of law ; and one law no doubt is or can be made as sharp as an- 
other, and chief justices may be found on both sides equally san- 
guinary. " Those men," says the chief justice of Jersey in the re- 
port enclosed by your Excellency, " who were charged with high 
treason, I committed to prison ; of this description were the said 
Hatfield and Badgely, who had joined the enemy long since the 
passing of the treason act, and whose persons by the law of nations 
are not protected by flags of truce." What shall be said. Sir, 
when a man of learning, as by profession this gentleman ought to 
be, can go this length ? Shall those who oppose the separation of 
the whole empire become traitors to a part, and be condemned by 
new laws, even during the contest, for their attachment to the old ? 
And shall the plea of sincerity and conscience, which is the vin- 
dication of some, be yet of no avail ? I have at present a purpose 
of establishing a court of criminal law in this town, for reasons 
which certain difficult questions have lately pressed upon me, and 
not, your Excellency may be assured, as an instrument of civil 
war. Yet it is manifest, that, if I were capable of making re- 
taliations in legal form, either retaliations must beget each other 
without end, to the disgrace of humanity, or the local laws of par- 
tial treason, lately passed in the Provinces, must be done away. 

But I think it impossible we should be of different minds on 
this subject. There must be some mistake in the way, which I do 
not understand. To prevent delay, and the imperfections of this 
sort of explanation. General Robertson, to whom I have commu- 
nicated your letters, has voluntarily offered personally to wait on 
your Excellency, and endeavour to place these questions, for the 
future, on ground of some mutual good understanding. I am there- 
fore to desire your Excellency's passports, for this purpose, for 
Lieutenant-General Robertson, an aid-de-camp, and George D. Lud- 
low, Esquire, either to wait on your Excellency, or to meet other 
persons empowered, at any place you may be pleased to appoint. 

I am, Sir, &c. 

Guv Carleton 



Aj-1-i.Nuix.j SIR GUY CARLKTOiN. 639 

New York, 7 July, 1782. 
Sir, 

However convinced of your Excellency's disposition, yet it gave 
nie imich satisfaction to be contirmcd therein by your letter of the 
thJd of June, wherein you say, that it would make you happy if 
any measures can be adopted for luunani/inir as much as possible 
the calamities attendant on a state of war. But yon are also 
pleased to say, resort must be had to the civil power, the laws 
roniplainod of having been passed without your agency, and not 
being under your control. I foci the fidl force of this argument, 
and shall be content to take any means, which can procure the 
desired end. I must ob.serve, however, that, as these laws are con- 
sidered by me, and in fact are, mere instruments of war, so I think, 
Sir, that on occasion of any conference with the civil power on 
this subject, it will be nece.«sary (as the army is so deeply engaged 
in the question), that you should at least have some confidential 
officer to assist in the attainment of a purpose, which I am per- 
suaded we both with C(iual earnestness desire, nor can I appre- 
hend any difficulty in the attainment. 

There are questions, which require only that they should be pro- 
posed to men of sound judgment and di.'^passionate tninds, that they 
may be assented to. The difficulties with mc. Sir, arc as to the 
mode ; and I sec no reason why I should not frankly call upon you 
for assistance. Am I, Sir, to apply to Congress, that persons ap- 
pointed by me may be admitted to conferences nt Philadolpliia ? 
Or can any deputation be sent by Congress to your camp for this 
purpose, to be there met by persons empowered by me ? Or will 
you. Sir, undertake to manage our common interest ? All I wish 
for is, that an end, in which our common honor and humanity are 
engaged, may be substantially obtained. 

I shall take this opportunity to inform your Excellency, that 1 
have learned within these few days, that clergymen, physicians, 
surgeons, and apothecaries, have been considered as prisoners of 
war, and paroled accordingly. This I am sure requires only the 
bare mention of it to be reformed. These paroles, if your Excel- 
lency concurs, may in public orders be discharged, and in future 
forbid as erroneous and contrary to the customs of war. 

I am further to inform you, Sir, that the court-martial upon 
Lippcncot for the murder of Huddy has given in its judgment, and 
the minutes of the trial, which ere long I shall order to be copied 
and sent to your Excellency accompanied by some other documents. 

I have ju.st learned from a letter written by your commissary- 



540 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

general of prisoners, that your objection to an exchange of land 
for naval prisoners is, that it would give us a great and permanent 
strength for which you could receive no adequate compensation. 
To remove this objection, I propose, that (all exchanges of men 
of the same description being exhausted) sailor and soldier shall be 
immediately exchanged, and the soldier so received by us shall not 
serve in nor against the thirteen Provinces for one year, a period 
which I trust will extend beyond our present contentions. This I 
think throws the advantage entirely into your hands ; but I do not 
think this inequality of importance enough to weigh against the 
imprisonment of so many men on both sides ; for imprisonment 
itself, attended with its necessary conditions, is, in this season es- 
pecially, a calamity which ought not to be imposed or protracted 
for political niceties. I am, &c. 

Guy C.\rleton. 

New York, 2 August, 1782. 
Sir, 

The pacific disposition of the Parliament and people of England 
towards the thirteen Provinces has already been communicated to 
you, and the resolutions of the House of Commons of the 27th of 
February last have been placed in your Excellency's hands, and 
intimations given at the same time, that further pacific measures 
were likely to follow. Since which, until the present time, we have 
had no direct communications from England ; but a mail is now 
arrived, which brings us very important information. 

We are acquainted, Sir, by authority, that negotiations for a gen- 
eral peace have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Gren- 
ville is invested with full powers to treat with all parties at war, 
and is now at Paris in the execution of his commission. And we 
are likewise, Sir, further made acquainted, that his Majesty, in order 
to remove all obstacles to that peace, which he so ardently wishes 
to restore, has commanded his ministers to direct Mr. Grenville, 
that the independency of the thirteen Provinces should be pro- 
posed by him in the first instance, instead of making it a condition 
of a general treaty ; however, not without the highest confidence, 
that the Loyalists shall be restored to their possessions, or a full 
compensation made to them for whatever confiscations may have 
taken place. 

With respect to Mr. Laurens, we are to acquaint you, that he has 
been enlarged and discharged from all engagements without any 
conditions whatever; after which he declared of his own accord, 
that he considered Lord Cornwallis as freed from his parole. Upon

this |X)int we arc lo desire your Excellency's sentiments, or those 
of Congress. 

We are further acquainted, that trans[X)rts liave been prepared 
in Kiitrland for conveyiui; all the American ])risoners to this coun- 
try, to be exchanged here ; and wo are directed to urge by every 
consideration of humanity the most speedy exchaiii;c, a measure in 
which not only the comforts but the rights of individuals are con- 
cerned. To obtain this end, a proposition has already been made, 
that (all exchanges of men of the same description being exhaust- 
ed) sailor and soldier should be immediately exchanged, man for 
man against each other, with this condition annexed, that your 
sailors should be at liberty to serve the moment they were ex- 
changed, and that the soldiers so received by us should not serve 
in nor against the thirteen Provinces for one year. And from this 
proposition, however unequal the conditions, we do not now wish 
to recede. We have the honor to be, &c. 

GtY CtRI.K.TO.V. 

Robert Diodv. 

new York, 25 October, 17d2. 
Sir, 

I am much at a loss how to answer the declarations of Congress 
communicated to me by your Excellency's letter of tiie •2d instant, 
nor do I fully comprehend their import. I understand, that the 
practice has been for nations at war to provide at the conclusion 
of a peace for the liquidation of all demands, made reciprocally for 
the maintenance of prisoners ; at which time the whole has either 
been compendiously settled, or further time given to collect an ac- 
count of expenses of maintenance from all parts where they have 
been incurred ; but we. Sir, on our part can have no objection 
to appoint commissaries at this period for the purpose of liquida- 
tion, if Congre.Hs earnestly desire that such liquidation shall be so 
prematurely made, but it has not been usual I think since the bar- 
barous ages to use any menaces, however obscure, towards prison- 
ers, and still less to practise towards them any barbarity. 

There is an ea.sy and honorable way for Congress to diminish 
the burthen, which our prisoners occasion. Let those, who, agree- 
ably to the terms of their surrender, should have been restored to 
their country five years ago, be now delivered up; let a number 
of our prisoners, equal to those we have liberated, be returned un- 
der the condition, that where soldiers are given for seamen, those 
soldiers are not to serve in or against the thirteen Provinces for 
twelve months, as has been formerly proposed ; let the remainder 

VOL. viir. TT

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



be given up for an equitable ransom, as is practised by all civilized 
people. 

While on our side so strong a desire of peace is manifested, 
your prisoners liberally and in confidence returned to their Prov- 
inces, I cannot but lament to find such indications as make me 
apprehend Congress is determined, not only to reject all peace, but 
to bring the war to the last extremities of rage, and, as far as in 
them lies, to transmit it down to posterity with all its horrors. 
Their refusing to release our prisoners for those we have sent in is 
in the nature of an injunction upon us not in future to release 
any more ; so that, in passing sentence on British prisoners, Con- 
gress should recollect, that it is passing the like sentence on those 
of America, who are or may fall into our hands, unless indeed it 
shall in the event be found, that the American prisoners may ex- 
perience the greatest share of tenderness and regard from those 
they call their enemies. I am, Sir, &,c. 

Guv Carleton. 

New York, G April, J783. 
Sir, 

A packet from England arrived in this port last night, by which 
I have despatches from Mr. Townshend, one of his Majesty's prin- 
cipal Secretaries of State, communicating official intelligence, that 
preliminary articles of peace with France and Spain were signed 
at Paris on the 20th of January last, and that the ratifications have 
been since exchanged at the same place. 

The King, Sir, has been pleased in consequence of these events, 
to order proclamations to be published, declaring a cessation of 
arms, as well by sea as land ; and his Majesty's pleasure signified, 
that I .should cause the same to be published in all places under 
my command, in order that his Majesty's subjects may pay imme- 
diate and due obedience thereto ; and such proclamation I shall 
accordingly cause to be made on Tuesday next, the 8th instant. 
In consequence thereof, and in conformity to the articles of peace, 
all our prisoners of war are to be set at liberty and restored with 
all convenient despatch, entertaining no doubt that similar meas- 
ures will be taken on the part of the United States of America. 
In like manner no doubt can be entertained, that Congress, in con- 
formity to the fifth article of the provisional treaty, will lose no 
time in earnestly recommending to the legislatures of the respective 
States to provide for the restitution of confiscated estates, and to 
reconsider and revise all laws of confiscation, that they may be ren-

timt spirit of conciliation, which, on tlie nUirn of the blessings 
of poacL', should universally prevail. 

And I am furtiier to inform your Excellency, that, an instru- 
ment of accession to the suspension of hostilities by the States- 
General of the United Provinces having been received in Eni];land, 
a cessation of arms with those States has been thereupon included 
in the proclamation. 

L'pon this great occasion. Sir, I am to olfer my strongest as- 
surances, that, during the short period of my command here, I 
shall be ready and earnest to cultivate that spirit of perfect good 
will, which, between the United States of America and the King 
of Great Britain, and the subjects and citizens of both countries, 
will, I trust, always remain. I am with mucii consideration, &c. 

Guy Carleton. 

New York, 12 May, 1763. 
Sill, 

I can have no objection to the giving of your Excellency, in 
writing, full information of the measures taken for the evacuation 
of this place, nor should I have had any to the noting of the 
whole of our conversation and preserving it in minutes. Mistakes 
or misconstruction might thereby be prevented. 

Very soon after the orders for a cessation of ho.stilitics were re- 
ceived here, letters were written both to Europe and the West In- 
dies, to require that all the shij)ping, which could be procured, 
micht be sent to assist in the evacuation of this place. About the 
same time all the prisoners of war in our hands were released. 

An embarkation was in much forwardness previous to the official 
information of peace. Soon after, I wrote to the minister of for- 
eign affairs to request, that Congress would be pleased to empower 
any person or persons in behalf of the United States to be pres- 
ent at New York, and to assist such persons as should be ap- 
pointed by me to inspect and superintend all embarkations, which 
the evacuation of this place might require; and that they would 
represent to me every infraction of the letter or spirit of the treaty, 
that redress might be immediately ordered. In the mean time, to 
prevent abuse or delay, and until I could learn the determination 
of Congress, I requested of Daniel Parker, Esquire, one of the 
contractors for supplying your army with provisions, and of Ma- 
jor Hopkins, late deputy commissary of prisoners, that they would 
undertake the business with other persons whom I appointed, which 
thcv did accordingly, and executed with much diligence. 



544 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Afpe.ndix. 

This fleet sailed about the 27th of April, for different parts of 
Nova Scotia, and, including the troops, carried about seven thousand 
persons with all their effects ; also some artillery and public stores ; 
so that you will perceive the evacuation began sooner, and was in 
greater forwardness, than could have been expected. Your Excel- 
lency will also perceive, from what I have said, that at present it 
is impossible to tell when the evacuation of this city can be com- 
pleted. In truth, I cannot guess the quantity of shipping that will 
be sent to me, nor the number of persons that will be forced to 
abandon this place. The evacuation of Penobscot will require 
considerably less tonnage, and I should think may soon be ef- 
fected. If it is most eligible to you that I should give a prefer- 
ence to this object, I shall immediately give orders for its being 
carried into most speedy execution. 

I enclose a copy of an order, which I have given out to pre- 
vent the carrying away any negroes or other property of the Amer- 
can inhabitants. I understand from the gentlemen therein named, 
that they visited the fleet bound to Nova Scotia, and ordered on 
shore whatever came clearly under the above description. There 
apjioarcd to be but little difference of opinion, except in the case 
of negroes who had been declared free previous to my arrival. 
As I have no right to deprive them of that liberty I found them 
possessed of, an accurate register was taken of every circumstance 
respecting them, so as to serve as a record of the name of the 
original proprietor of the negro, and as a rule by which to judge 
of his value. By this open method of conducting the business, I 
hoped to prevent all fraud, and whatever might admit of different 
constructions is left open for future explanation or compensation. 
Had these negroes been denied permission to embark, they would, 
in spite of every means to prevent it, have found various methods 
of quitting this place, so that the former owner would no longer 
have been able to trace them, and of course would have lost, in 
every way, all chance of compensation. 

The business carried on in this public manner, and the orders 
nominating persons to superintend embarkations published in the 
gazette, I had no reason to think either the embarkation, or any 
circumstances attending it, could have been matter of surprise to 
your Excellency on the Cth of May. I then however learned with 
concern, that the embarkation, which had already taken place, and 
in which a large number of negroes had been conveyed away, ap- 
peared to your E.xcellency as a measure totally different from the 
letter and spirit of the treaty. 



Appendix.] SIR GUY CARLET(3N. •'i45 

The negroes in question, I have already said, I tbuiid free wlirn 
I arrived at New York. 1 had therefore no riglit, as I ihoujrlit, 
to prevent their going away to any part of the world tliey thought 
proper. 

1 must confess, that the mere supposition that the King's minister 
could deliberately stipulate in a treaty an engagement to be guilty 
of a notorious breach of the public faith, towards people of any 
comple.\ion, seems to denote a less Iriendly disposition than I could 
wish, and I think less friendly than we might expect. After all, I 
only give my own opinion. Every negro's name is registered, and 
the master he formerly belonged to, with such other circumstances 
as si-rvod to denote hi.s value, that it may be adjusted by compen- 
sation, if that was really the intention and meaning of the treaty. 
Restoration, where inseparable from a breach of public faith, is, as 
all the world I think must allow, utterly impracticable. I know 
of no better method of preventing abuse, and the carrying away 
of negroes or other American property, than that I proposed to the 
minister of foreign affairs in my letter of the 1-lth of April, the 
naming of commissioners to assist those appointed by mc to inspect 
all embarkations ; and I am pleased to fiii<l your Excellency has 
approved of this method, and appointed Egbert Benson, Esquire, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, and Daniel Parker, Esquire, one of the 
contractors for supplying your army with provisions, commissioners 
on your part for this purpose. I am. Sir, &,c.

Sir, 
The preparations for withdrawing his Majesty's troops from this 
place are so far advanced, that, unless some untoward accident 
should intervene, I hope it may be accomplished some days before 
the end of the present month. At all events, I propose to relin- 
quish the posts at Kingsbridge, and as far as McGowan's Pass in- 
clusive on this Island, on the 21sl instant ; to resign the possession 
of Herrick's and Hampstead with all to the eastward on Long Isl- 
and, on the same day ; and, if possible, to give up this city with 
Brooklyn, on the day following ; and Paulus Hook, Dennis's, and 
Statcn Island, as soon after as may be ])racticable. Your Excel- 
lency, however, will see the necessity of my making a reserve re- 
specting the city of New York, that, if any of our ships shotJd 
happen to want repairs after the town is evacuated, we shall still 
have a free and uninterrupted use of the Ship-vard, under the di-

Sir, 

His Majesty's troops will retire from Kingsbridge and McGowan's 
Pass on this Island, on the 2Ist instant, as notified to your Excel- 
lency in my letter of the I'^th ; and I shall resign the possession of 
Herrick's and Hanipstead, with all to the eastward on Long Island, 
the same day. Paulus Hook will be relinquished on the day follow- 
ing ; but, though every exertion has been made with a view to 
evacuate this city at the same time, which it was my hope and in- 
tention to do, I now find it impracticable. Yet, notwithstanding 
the winds have lately been very unfavorable, if I have proper as- 
surances that we shall retain a free and uninterrupted use of the 
Ship-yard and Hallet's Wharf in New York, and the Brewery and 
Bake-house on Long Island, (which the admiral represents as in- 
dispensably necessary for the shipping and sick seamen,) until we 
can be ready to take our final departure, I shall retire from this 
city and from Brooklyn on Tuesday next at noon, or as soon after 
as wind and weather may permit ; only retaining (in addition to the 
reservations above specified) Staten Island, with Dennis's, New 
Utrecht, and the circumjacent district on Long Island, for such 
time as may be found absolutely requisite for the troops, that may 
then remain unprovided with transports. 

I have received repeated information, the substance of which I 
enclose, that a deliberate combination has been formed to plunder 
this town whenever the King's troops shall be withdrawn; and, as 
I doubt not but your Excellency is, with me, desirous to prevent 
every species of enormity on this interesting occasion, I give you 
this intimation, which I have reason to think is well founded, and 
shall endeavour to persuade the informant to wait on you in per-

of the resentment of those concerning whom he has given infor- 
mation. I am. Sir, <Slc.

A SKETCH OF Tin: STATE OF OPINIONS IN THE OLD 
CONGRESS, DRAWN UP BY MR. MADISON." 

The two great objects, which predominate in the jwlitics of Con- 
gress at this juncture are Vermont and the Western Territory. 

I. The independence of Vermont and its admission into the 
confederacy are patronized by the eastern States (New Hampshire 
excepted), first, from an ancient prejudice .against New York ; 
secondly, the interest which citizens of those States have in lands 
granted by Vermont ; thirdly, but principally, from the accession of 
weight they will derive from it in Congress. New Hampshire, 
having gained its main object by the exclusion of its territory east 

' This pnper, dated May 1st, 1782, was presented to me by Mr. Madison, 
and was written by him while in Congress at the time of its date. It cxiiib- 
its an interesting view of two important topics, which then engaged the de- 
liberations of that body, and the policy of the different States, as growing out 
of local and other causes.

WASPIINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



of Connecticut River from the claims of Vermont, is already in- 
different to its independence, and wUl probably soon combine with 
other eastern States in its favor. 

The same patronage is yielded to the pretensions of Vermont 
by Pennsylvania and Maryland, with the sole view of reinforcing 
the opposition to claims of western territory, particularly those of 
Virginia, and by New Jersey and Delaware with the additional 
view of strengthening the interests of the little States. Both of 
these considerations operate also on Rhode Island, in addition to 
those above mentioned. 

The independence of Vermont and its admission into the Union 
are opposed by New York for reasons obvious and well known. 

The like opposition is made by Virginia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, and Georgia. The grounds of this opposition are, first, 
an habitual jealousy of a predominance of eastern interests ; sec- 
ondly, the opposition expected from Vermont to western claims ; 
thirdly, the inexpediency of admitting so unimportant a State to 
an equal vote in deciding on peace, and all the other grand in- 
terests of the Union now depending ; fourthly, the influence of 
the example on a premature dismemberment of the other States. 
These considerations influence the four States last mentioned in 
different degrees. The second and third, to say nothing of the 
fourth, ought to be decisive with Virginia. 

II. The territorial claims, particularly those of Virginia, are 
opposed by Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
and Maryland. Rhode Island is influenced in her opposition, first, 
by a lucrative desire of sharing in the vacant territory as a fund 
of revenue ; secondly, by the envy and jealousy naturally excited 
by superior resources and importance. New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware, and Maryland are influenced partly by the same con- 
siderations, but principally by the intrigues of their citizens, who 
are interested in the claims of land companies. The decisive in- 
fluence of this last consideration is manifest from the peculiar and 
persevering opposition made against Virginia, within whose limits 
those claims lie. 

The western claims, or rather a final settlement of them, are 
also thwarted by Massachusetts and Connecticut. This object with 
them is chiefly subservient to that of Vermont, as the latter is 
with Pennsylvania and Maryland to the former. The general poli- 
cy and interests of these two States are opposed to the admission 
of Vermont into the Union ; and, if the case of the western terri- 
tory were once removed, they would instantly divide from the 



Appesdh.I count DK Vr.RCKNNES. ^ii^-) 

eastprn States in the case of Vcrmoiit. Of tliis Miissacliusrtts and 
Connecticut are not insensible, and iherclbre lind their advantage 
in keeping tiic territorial controversy pending. Connecticut may 
liivewise conceive some analogy between lnr claim to the western 
country and that of Virginia; and that the acceptance of the ces- 
sion of the latter would intluence her sentiments in the contro- 
versy between the former and Pennsylvania. 

The western claims are opposed by Virginia, North C.irolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, and New York, all of these States being 
interested therein. South Carolina is the least so. The claim of 
New York is very extensive, but her title very flimsy. She urges 
it more with the hope of obtaining some advantage or credit by 
its cession, than of ever maintaining it. If her cession should be 
accepted, and the allair of Vermont terminated, as these are the 
only ties which unite her with the southern States, she will im- 
mediately connect her jwlicy with that of the eastern States, as 
far at least as the remains of former prejudices will permit.

LETTER FROM COUNT DE VERGENNES TO GENERAL WASH- 
LNGTON, RESPECTING CAPTAIN ASGILL. 

Versailles, 20 July, 1782. 

Snt, 

It is not in quality of a King, the friend and ally of the United 
States, (though with the knowledge and consent of his Majesty) 
that I now have the honor to write to your Excellency. It is as 
a man nf sonsibilitv and a tender father, who feels all the force of 
paternal love, that I take the liberty to address to your Excellency 
my earnest solicitations in favor of a mother and family in tears. 
Her situation seems the more worthy of notice on our part, as it is 
to the humanity of a nation at war with her own, that she has re- 
course, for what she ought to receive from the impartial justice 
of her own generals. 

I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency a copy of a letter, 
which Lady Asgill has just written me. I am not known to her, 
nor was I acquainted that her son was the unhappy victim, destined 
by lot to expiate the odious crime that a formal denial of justice 
obliges you to avenge. Your Excellency will not read this letter 



550 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



without being extremely affected ; it had that effect upon the King 
and Queen, to whom I communicated it. The goodness of their 
Majesties' hearts induces them to desire, that the inquietudes of 
an unfortunate mother may be cahned, and her tenderness reas- 
sured. I felt. Sir, that there are cases where humanity itself ex- 
acts the most extreme rigor ; perhaps the one now in question may 
be of the number; but, allowing reprisals to be just, it is not less 
horrid to those who are the victuns ; and the character of your 
Excellency is too well known, for me not to be persuaded that you 
desire nothing more than to be able to avoid the disagreeable ne- 
cessity. 

There is one consideration, Sir, which, though it is not decisive, 
may have an influence on your resolution. Captain Asgill is 
doubtless your prisoner, but he is among those whom the arms of 
the King contributed to put into your hands at Yorktown. Al- 
though this circumstance does not operate as a safeguard, it how- 
ever justifies the interest I permit myself to take in this affair. 
If it is in your power. Sir, to consider and have regard to it, you 
will do what is agreeable to their Majesties ; the danger of young 
Asgill, the tears, the despair of his mother, affect thom sensibly ; 
and they will see with pleasure the hope of consolation shine out 
for those unfortunate people. 

In seeking to deliver Mr. Asgill from the fate which threatens 
him, I am far from engaging you to secure another victim ; the par- 
don, to be perfectly satisfactory, must be entire. I do not imagine 
it can be productive of any bad consequences. If the English 
general has not been able to punish the horrible crime you com- 
plain of, in so exemplary a manner as he should, there is reason 
to think he will take the most efficacious measures to prevent the 
like in future. 

I sincerely wish. Sir, that my intercession may meet success ; 
the sentiment which dictates it, and which you have not ceased to 
manifest on every occasion, assures me, that you will not be in- 
different to the prayers and to the tears of a family, which has 
recourse to your clemency through me. It is rendering homage 
to your virtue to implore it. 

I have the honor to be, with the most perfect consideration. 
Sir, yours, &,c.

NKWBURG ADDRESSES. 

Artor the army had marched from their encampment at Ver- 
plaiick's Point, and gone into wintcr-<iuarlers at Newburg, they 
had leisure to reflect upon tiieir situation and prospects. The an- 
ticipation of a speedy peace, and tiie long arrearages of their pay, 
while their claims were unadjusted, their accounts unsettled, and 
no erticient security was provided for a future liquidation of them, 
were causes of nuich excitement and unensiness. In the month of 
December they came to a serious determination to address Congress 
on the subject of their grievances. A memorial was accordingly 
drawn up, which was agreed to by the principal officers, and was 
understood to express the sense of the army. A committee was 
appointed to carry this memorial to Pliihidelphia, and lay it before 
Congress, with such verbal representations to the several members 
as would fully explain its import, and the condition, feelings, and 
expectations of the army. This committee consisted of General 
WcDougall, Colonel Ogden, and Colonel Brooks. They proceeded 
to Philadelphia, and a few days after their arrival Congress passed 
the following resolutions, on the 25th of January, 17S3. 

" The grand counnitlee, consisting of a member from each St.ate, 
report, that they have considered the contents of a memorial pre- 
sented by the army, and find that they comprehend five dillerenl 
articles ; 

" 1. Present pay. 

" 2. A settlement of accounts of the arrearages of pay, and se- 
curity for what is due. 

"3. A commutation of the half-pay allowed by diflerent resolu- 
tions of Congress for an equivalent in gross. 

"4. A settlement of the accounts of deficiencies of rations and 
compensation. 

" 5. A settlement of the accounts of deficiencies of clothing and 
compensation. 

" Whereupon, Resolved, as to the first, that the superintendent 
of finance be directed, conformably to the measures already taken 
for that purpose, as soon as the state of the public finances will 
permit, to make such payment and in such manner as he shall think 
proper, till the further order of Congress. 

" Resolved, With respect to the second article, so far as relates 



552 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appeotix. 

to the settlement of accounts, that the several States be called upon 
to complete without delay the settlements with their respective lines 
of the army, up to the 1st day of August, 1783, and that the su- 
perintendent of finance be directed to take such measures as shall 
appear to him most proper for effecting the settlement from that 
period. 

" As to what relates to the providing security for what shall be 
found due on such settlement ; 

" Resolved, That the troops of the United States, in common 
with all creditors of the same, have an undoubted right to expect 
such security ; and that Congress will make every effort in tlieir 
power to obtain, from the respective States, substantial funds, ade- 
quate to the object of funding the whole debt of the United States, 
and will enter upon an immediate and full consideration of the na- 
ture of such funds, and the most likely mode of obtaining them. 

" Ordered, That the remainder of the report be referred to a 
committee of five." 

General Knox had been appointed on the part of the army to 
correspond with the committee respecting the objects of their com- 
mission, and he received from them the following report. 

" Philadelphia, 8 February, 1783 

" Dear Sir, 

" The army has, no doubt, been anxious to hear from us, and 
we should have had as much pleasure in communicating to them 
any success of our application for them, as they in receiving it; 
but nothing of any moment has yet been decided for them. We 
spent the first week after our arrival in conversing witli the mem- 
bers of Congress on the subject of the address, to prepare them 
for the reception of it before it was read, lest the want of informa- 
tion should retard a favorable resolution on it. On its being read, 
a committee was appointed to confer with us, consisting of a mem- 
ber from each State but Georgia, which was unrepresented, and 
had no member attending. The financier attended at this meeting. 
To this committee we communicated the condition of the army, 
and we dilated very diffusely on all the subjects stated in the address ; 
indeed, truth and decency were the only bounds observed in our 
conference with them. The reason of our applying to Congress to 
determine on a compensation for half-pay was also minutely detailed. 

" The result as to present pay will be communicated to you by 
Colonel Brooks. On this subject we can only commit to paper, 
that a month's pay in notes to the officers, and one to the non- 
commissioned and privates, as weekly payments of half a dollar

|K.T wi'ik 10 lilt' latter t* nil that can be now obtained. This grand 
coniMiitti'f appointed a sulvcoinrniltee to coiivor.-te with us, as occa- 
sion should require, if any new matter occurred to us; nud to in- 
spect critically into the principles of annuities, in order U) deter- 
mine on an etpiivalent for the hall-pay. 

" In about ten days they re|)ortcd to the grand connnittcc, that 
twelve years was a mean life of the ages of the olliccrs of the ar- 
my, and that six whole years' pay was equal, to the country and 
the army, to llie half-pay for life. The committee then re|M)rted to 
Congress, which produced the resolutions which have been trans- 
mitted to the Commander-in-chief That part of the report, which 
respected the value of the half-pay, was recommitted to a smaller 
committee, the number of years being considered tfx) many. 

" This committee took up some time to examine calculations on 
annuities, and two days ago they reported five years' whole pay as 
equal to the half-pay for life ; but nine States would not approve the 
re|X)rt, Georgia, .Maryland, and Delaware unrepresented. We ad- 
vised our friends not to press lor a determination, if they could not 
carry the question ; as the sense of Maryland and Delaware were 
known to be favorable to us, and their delegates were daily ex- 
pected in town. On discussion in Congress, some of the members 
opposed to the commutation, and equidly so to half-pay, expressed 
a desire to put off the question, to give them time for more con- 
sideration ; it was accordingly granted. Thus stands the matter 
of commutation. 

" iMussachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and 
South Carolina were for the equivalent ; New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, and Jersey were against it. There is some 
prospect of getting one more of these States to vote for the coni- 
inutation. If this is accomplished, with Maryland and Delaware, 
the question will be carried ; whenever it is, as the report now 
stands, it will be at the election of a line, as such, to accept of the 
commutation or retain their claim to the half-pay. Congress beinf 
determined, that no alteration shall take place in the emolument 
held out to the army but by their consent. 

" This rendered it unnecessary for us to consult the army on the 
equivalent for the half-pay. The zeal of a great number of mem- 
bers of Congress to get Continental funds, while a few wished to 
have us referred to the States, induced us to conceal what funds 
we wished, or expected, lest our declaration for one or the other 
might retard a settlement of our accounts, or a determination on 
the equivalent for half-pay. Indeed, some of our best friends in 

VOL. VIII. 70 VU 



554 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix.' 

Congress declared, however desirous tliey were to have our accounts 
settled, and the commutation fixed, as well as to get funds, yet 
they would oppose referring us to the States for a settlement and 
security, till all prospect of obtaining Continental funds was at an 
end. 

" Whether this is near or not, as commutation for the half-pay 
was one of the principal objects of the address, the obtaining of 
that is necessary, previous to our particularizing what fund will be 
most agreeable to us ; this must be determined by circumstances. 
If Congress get funds we shall be secured. If not, the equivalent 
settled, a principle will be established, which will be more ac- 
ceptable to the eastern States than half-pay, if application must be 
made to them. As it is not likely that Congress will be able to 
determine soon on the commutation (for the reasons above-men- 
tioned), it is judged necessary that Colonel Brooks return to the 
army, to give them a more particular detail of our prospects than 
can be done in the compass of a letter. It is however thought 
proper, that General Mi-'Dougall should remain in Philadelphia, to 
endeavour at a proper time to bring on the determination of Con- 
gress on the important question, as well as to quicken the accom- 
plishment of the other points contained in the address. In the 
mean time Colonel Ogden visits his family, as well as to do some 
business which will greatly promote the object of our being sent 
here. Colonel Ogden will, however, return, if it should be judged 
necessary. We conceive it expedient to make the army this gen- 
eral report, and beg leave to refer you to Colonel Brooks for a 
more particular one. 

" We are. Sir, with great truth, your affectionate humble servants. 

" Alex. McDougall. 

"M. Ogden." 

The representations thus communicated, in the resolves of Con- 
gress and the report of the committee, were by no means satisfac- 
tory to all the officers of the army, if indeed to any. Further 
measures to make known their sentiments and enforce their claims 
were by some of them thought necessary. In the opinion of these 
persons a fit occasion was now presented " for assembling the offi- 
cers, not in mass, but by representation ; and for passing a series 
of resolutions, which, in the hands of their committee, and of their 
auxiliaries in Congress, would furnish a new and powerful lever for 
operating on the two dissenting States. But to this end, there was 
yet wanting the interposition of a hand, which should touch with 
some ability the several chords of sympathy and feeling that be-

" Age has its claims, and rank is not without its pretensions to

the plain language of sincerity and experience will neither be un-

" Like many of you he loved private life, and left it with re-

lately, believed in the justice of his country. lie hoped, that, as 
the clouds of adversity scattered, and as the sunshine of peace and 
better fortune broke in upon us, the coldness and severity of gov- 
ernment would relax ; and that more than justice, that gratitude, 
would blaze forth upon those hands, which had upheld her in the 
darkest stages of her passage from impending servitude to acknowl- 
edged independence. 

" But faith has its limits as well as temper ; and there are points, 
beyond which neither can be stretched without sinking into coward- 
ice or plunging into credulity. This, my friends, I conceive to be 
your situation ; hurried to the very verge of both, another step 
would ruin you for ever. To be tame and unprovoked, when inju- 
ries press hard upon you, is more than weakness ; but to look up 
for kinder usage, without one manly eflbrt of your own, would fix 
your character, and show the world how richly you deserve those 
chains you broke. To guard against this evil, let us take a review 
of the ground upon which we now stand, and from thence carry 
our thoughts forward for a moment into the unexplored field of 
expedient. 

" After a pursuit of seven long years, the object for which we 
set out is at length brought within our reach. Yes, my friends, that 
suffering courage of yours was active once ; it has conducted the 
United States of America through a doubtful and bloody war ; it 
has placed her in the chair of independency, and peace returns 
again to bless — whom? A country willing to redress your wrongs, 
cherish your worth, and reward your services 1 A country courting 
your return to private life, with tears of gratitude and smiles of ad- 
miration, longing to divide with you that independency which 
your gallantry has given, and those riches which your wounds have 
preserved ? Is this the case 1 Or is it rather a country, that 
tramples upon your rights, disdains your cries, and insults your 
distresses 1 Have you not more than once suggested your wishes, 
and made known your wants to Congress, wants and wishes, which 
gratitude and policy should have anticipated, rather than evaded ? 
And have you not lately, in the meek language of entreating me- 
morials, begged from their justice what you could no longer ex- 
pect from their favor ? How have you been answered ? Let the 
letter, which you are called to consider to-morrow, make reply ! 

" If this then be your treatment, while the swords you wear are 
necessary for the defence of America, what have 3'ou to expect from 
peace, when your voice shall sink, and your strength dissipate by 
division ; when those very swords, the instruments and companions

of your glory, slmll be tnkcn from your sidos, and no remaining 
mark of military distinction left but your wants, infirmities, anil 
Hciirs .' Can you then consent to lie tlie only sullerirs by tliis revo- 
lution, and, retiring from the field, grow old in jxjverly, wretclied- 
iicsa, and contempt? Can you consent to wade through the rile 
mire of deiiondency, and owe the miserable remnant of that life to 
charily, which has hitherto been spent in honor ( If you can, go, 
and carry with you the jest of Tories, and the scorn of Whigs ; 
the ridicule, and what is worse, the pity of the world I Go, starve 
and be forgotten ! But if your spirits should revolt at this ; if you 
have sense enough to discover and spirit sullicient to oppose tyr- 
anny, under whatever garb it may assume, whether it be the plain 
coat of republicanism, or the splendid robe of royalty ; if you have 
yet learned to discriminate between a people and a cause, between 
men and principles; awake, attend to your situation, and redress 
yourselves! If the present moment be lost, every future eflbrt is 
in vain ; and your threats then will be as empty as your entrea- 
ties now. 

" I would advise you, therefore, to come to some final opinion ui>- 
on what you can bear, and what you will suffer. If your determi- 
nation be in any proportion to your wrongs, carry your appeal from 
the justice to the fears of government. Change the milk-and-water 
style of your last memorial. Assume a bolder tone, decent, but 
lively, spirited, and determined; and suspect the man, who would 
advise to more moderation and longer forlwarance. Let two or 
three men, who can feel as well as write, be ainxjintcd to draw up 
your last remotislrance, for I would no longer give it the suing, soft, 
unsuccessful epithet of mnnorial. Let it represent in language, 
that will neither dishonor you by its rudeness, nor betray you by 
its fears, what has been promised by Congress, and what has been 
performed ; how long and how patiently you have suffered ; how 
little you have asked, and how much of that little has been denied. 
Tell them, that, thonijh you were the first, and would wish to bo 
last, to encounter danger, though despair itself can never drive you 
into dishonor, it may drive you from the field ; that the wound, often 
irritated and never healed, may at length become incurable ; and that 
the slightest mark of indignity from Congress now must operate 
like the grave, and part you for ever ; thai, in any political event, the 
army has its alternative. If peace, that nothing shall .'^parate you 
from your arms but death ; if war, that courting the auspices, and 
inviting the direction of your illustrious loader, you will retire to 
some unsettled country, smile in your turn, ' and mock when

their fear cometh on.' But let it represent, also, that should they 
comply with the request of your late memorial, it would make you 
more happy and them more respectable ; that, while war should 
continue, you would follow their standard into the field ; and when 
it came to an end, you would withdraw into the shade of private 
life, and give the world another subject of wonder and applause ; 
an army victorious over its enemies, victorious over itself" 

In consequence of the circulation of these papers, the subse- 
quent orders were issued on the Ilth of March. 

GENERAL ORDERS. 

" The Commander-in-chief, having heard that a general meeting 
of the officers of the army was proposed to be held this day at the 
New Building, in an anonymous paper, which was circulated yes- 
terday by some unknown person, conceives, (although he is fully 
persuaded that the good sense of the officers would induce them 
to pay very little attention to such an irregular invitation,) his 
duty, as well as the reputation and true interest of the army, re- 
quires his disapprobation of such disorderly proceedings ; at the 
same time he requests, that the general and field officers, with one 
officer from each company, and a proper representation of the staff 
of the army, will assemble at twelve o'clock on Saturday next at 
the New Building, to hear the report of the committee of the 
army to Congress. 

" After mature deliberation they will devise what further meas- 
ures ought to be adopted, as most rational, and best calculated 
to attain the just and important object in view. 

" The senior officer in rank present will be pleased to preside, 
and report the result of their deliberations to the Commander-in- 
chief" 

second anonymous address to the officers of the army. 

" Gentlemen, 

" The author of a late address, anxious to deserve, though he 
should fail to engage your esteem, and determined at every risk 
to unfold your duty and discharge his own, would beg leave to so- 
licit the further indulgence of a few moments' attention. 

" Aware of the covness with which his last letter would be re- 
ceived, he feels himself neither disappointed nor displeased with the 
caution it has met. He well knew, that it spoke a language, 
which till now had been heard only in whispers ; and that it con- 
tained some sentiments, which confidence itself would have breath- 
ed with distrust. But their lives have been short, and their obser-

vatioii imiwrlect indci-il, who li;ive yd to learii, that alarms may 1)C 
false ; tliat the best ilcsisjiis are sometimes obliged to assume the 
worst as[)ect ; and that, however synonymous surprise and disaster 
may l)c in millt;irv jihrasc, in moral and political meaning they 
convey ideas as dilVercnt as they are distinct. Suspicion, detestable 
as it is in private life, is the loveliest trait of (ralitical characters. 
It prompts you to imiuiry, bars the door against design, and open.s 
every avenue to truth. It was the first to ()|>pose a tyrant here, 
and still stands sentinel over the liberties of America. With this 
belief, it would ill become me to stifle the voice of this honest 
guardian ; a guardian, who (authorized by circumstances digested 
into prool") has herself given birth to the address you have read, 
and now goes forth among you, with a request to all, that it may 
be treated fairly ; that it be considered, before it be abused, and 
condemned, before it be tortured ; convinced that, in a search after 
error, truth will appear; that apathy itself will grow warm in the 
pursuit, and, though it will be the last to adopt her advice, it will 
be the first to act upon it. 

" The General Orders of yesterday, which the weak may mistake 
for disapprobation, and the designing dare to represent as such, 
wears in my opinion a very diflbrent complexion, and carries with 
it a very opposite tendency. 

" Till now, the Commander-in-chief has regarded the steps you 
have taken for redress with good wishes alone ; his ostensible si- 
lence has authorized your meetings, and his private opinion has 
sanctified your claims. Had he disliked the object in view, would 
not the same sense of duty, which forbade you from meeting on 
the third day of the week, have forbidden you from meeting on the 
seventh ? Is not the same subject held up for your discussion, and 
has it not passed the seal of oflice, and taken all the solemnity 
of an order? This will give system to your proceedings, and sta- 
bility to your resolves. It will ripen speculation into fact; and, 
while it adds to the unanimity, it cannot possibly lessen the inde- 
pendency of your sentiments. It may be necessary to add upon 
this subject, that, from the injunction with which the General Or- 
ders close, every man is at liberty to conclude, that the report to 
be made to Head-Quarters is intended for Congress. Hence will 
arise another motive for that energy, which has been recommended. 
For can you give the lie to the pathetic descriptions of your repre- 
sentations, and the more alarming predictions of our friends? 

" To such, as make a want of signature an objection to opinion, 
I reply, that it matters very little who is the author of sentiments. 



660 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

which grow out of your feelings, and apply to your wants ; that in 
this instance diffidence suggested what experience enjoins ; and 
that, while I continue to move on the high road of argument and 
advice, which is open to all, I shall continue to be the sole con- 
fidant of my own secret. But should the time come, when it shall 
be necessary to depart from this general line, and hold up any in- 
dividual among you as an object of the resentment or contempt of 
the rest, I thus publicly pledge my honor as a soldier, and veracity 
as a man, that I will then assume a visible existence, and give my 
name to the army, with as little reserve as I now give my opin- 
ions." 

Conformably to the notification given in the general orders of 
the 11th, a meeting of the officers was held on the 15th, at the 
hour and place appointed. General Gates, as the senior ofiicer, 
presided. The meeting was opened by the Commander-in-chief, 
who read the following 

address to the officers assembled. 

' Gentlemen, 

" By an anonymous summons an attempt has been made to con- 
vene you together. How inconsistent with the rules of propriety, 
how unmilitary, and how subversive of all good order and disci- 
pline, let the good sense of the army decide. 

" In the moment of this summons, another anonymous production 
was sent into circulation ; addressed more to the feelings and pas- 
sions, than to the reason and judgment of the army. The author 
of the piece is entitled to much credit for the goodness of his pen, 
and I could wish he had as much credit for the rectitude of his 
heart ; for, as men see through different optics, and are induced 
by the reflecting faculties of the mind to use different means to 
obtain the same end, the author of the address should have had 
more charity, than to mark for suspicion the man, who should 
recommend moderation and longer forbearance, or in other words, 
who should not think as he thinks, and act as he advises. But he 
had another plan in view, in which candor and liberality of senti- 
ment, regard to justice, and love of country, have no part ; and he 
was right to insinuate the darkest suspicion, to effect the blackest 
designs. 

" That the address is drawn with great art, and is designed to 
answer the most insidious purposes, that it is calculated to impress 
the mind with an idea of premeditated injustice in the sovereign 
power of the United States, and rouse all those resentments, which 



Appknoix.) N I:\VHU IK; AI)I)RKSSt;S. 561 

must uiKtvouliiMy llow from sucli a bclit't"; that tlie sccrrl mover 
of this sclK-mc, wlinovor lu; may be, intcndi'd to take advantage of 
the passions, while tliey were warmetl by tlio recollection of past 
distresses, without jjiviiij; time for cixjj, deliberate tliiiikiiiir, mul 
that comiwsure of mind, wliicli is so necessary to give dignity and 
stability to measures, is rendered too obvious, by the mode of con- 
ducting the business, to need otiier jjroof than a reference to the 
proceeding. 

" Thus much, Gentlemen, I have thought it incundient on me 
to observe to you, to show upon what principles I opposed the ir- 
regular and hasty meeting, which was proposed to be held on 
Tuesday last, and not because I wanted a disposition to give you 
every op(«)rtunity, consistent with your own honor and the dignity 
of the army, to make known your grievances. If my conduct here- 
tofore has not evinced to you, that I have been a faithful friend to 
the army, my declaration of it at this time would be ecpially un- 
availing and inipriiper. But, as I was among the first, who embark- 
ed in the cause of our conunon country ; as I have never left your 
side one moment, but when called from you on public duty ; as I 
have been the constant companion and witness of your distresses, 
and not among the last to feel and acknowledge your merits; as I 
have ever considered my own military reputation as inseparably 
connected with that of the army ; as my heart has ever expanded 
with joy, when I have heard its praises, and my indignation has 
arisen, when the mouth of detraction has been opened against it; 
it can scarcely be supposed, at this late stage of the war, that I am 
indifferent to its interests. But how are they to be promoted f 
The way is plain, says the anonymous addresser ; if war continues, 
remove into the unsettled country ; there establish yourselves, and 
leave an ungrateful country to defend itself. But whom are they to 
defend? Our wives, our children, our farms and other property, 
which we leave behind us? Or, in the state of hostile separation, 
are we to take the two first (the latter cannot be removed) to perish 
in a wilderness with hunger, cold, and nakedness ? If peace takes 
place, never sheathe your swords, says he, until you have obtained 
full and ample justice. This dreadful alternative, of either desert- 
ing our country in the extrcmest hour of distress, or turning our 
arms against it, which is the apparent object, unless Congress can 
be compelled into instant compliance, has something so shocking 
in it, that humanity revolts at the idea. My God ! What can this 
writer have in view by recommending such measures ? Can he be 
a friend to the army ? Can he be a friend to this country ? Rather 

VOL. VIII. 71 



562 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendis. 

is he not an insidious foe 1 Some emissary, perhaps from New 
York, plotting the ruin of both by sowing the seeds of discord 
and separation between the civil and military powers of the con- 
tinent? And what a compliment does he pay to our understand- 
ings, when he recommends measures, in either alternative, imprac- 
ticable in their nature ? 

" But here. Gentlemen, I will drop the curtain, because it would 
be as imprudent in me to assign my reasons for this opinion, as 
it would be insulting to your conception to suppose you stood in 
need of them. A moment's reflection will convince every dispas- 
sionate mind of the physical impossibility of carrying either pro- 
posal into execution. 

" There might, Gentlemen, be an impropriety in my taking no- 
tice, in this address to you, of an anonymous production ; but the 
manner in which that performance has been introduced to the 
army, the effect it was intended to have, together with some other 
circumstances, will amply justify my observations on the tendency 
of that writing. With respect to the advice given by the author 
to suspect the man, who shall recommend moderate measures and 
longer forbearance, I spurn it, as every man who regards that lib- 
erty, and reveres that justice, for which we contend, undoubtedly 
must. For, if men are to be precluded from offering their senti- 
ments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarm- 
ing consequences, that can invite the consideration of mankind, 
reason is of no use to us ; the freedom of speech may be taken 
away, and, dumb and silent, we may be led away like sheep to 
the slaughter. 

" I cannot, in justice to my own belief, and what I have great 
reason to conceive is the intention of Congress, conclude this ad- 
dress, without giving it as my decided opinion, that that honorable 
body entertain exalted sentiments of the services of the army, and, 
from a full conviction of its merits and sufferings, will do it com- 
plete justice. That their endeavours to discover and establish 
funds for this purpose have been unwearied, and wdl not cease, 
till they have succeeded, I have no doubt ; but, like all other large 
bodies, where there is a variety of different interests to reconcile, 
their deliberations are slow. Why then should we distrust them ; 
and, in consequence of that distrust, adopt measures, which may 
cast a shade over that glory, which has been so justly acquired, 
and tarnish the reputation of an army, which is celebrated through 
all Europe for its fortitude and patriotism ? And for what is this 
done ? To bring the object we seek nearer 1 No ! Most certainly, 
in my opinion, it will cast it at a greater distance.

" For mvsoir (■"xl I tako no nurit in jjivinr; ihn axsnrancn, being 
induced to it iVom prinriplos of graliliulr, viTacity, and jiistico), a 
grateful sense of the confidence you have ever placed in me, a 
recollection of the cheerful assistance and prompt obedience I have 
experienced from jou, under every vicissitude of fortune, and the 
sincere afieclion I feel for an army I have so long had the honor 
to command, oblige me to declare in this public and solemn man- 
ner, that, in the attainment of complete justice for all your toils and 
dangers, and in the gratification of every wish, so far as may be 
done consistently with the great duly I owe to my country, and 
those powers we are bound to respect, you may freely command my 
services to the utmost extent of my abilities. 

" While I give you these assurances, and pledge myself in the 
most unequivocal manner to exert whatever ability I am possessed 
of in your favor, let me entreat you. Gentlemen, on your part, not 
to take any measures, wliicii, in the calm light of reason, will les- 
sen the dignity and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained. 
Let me request you to rely on the plighted faith of your country, 
and place a full confidence in the purity of the intentions of Con- 
gress, that, previous to your dissolution as an army, they will cause 
all your accounts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in their reso- 
lutions, which were published to you two days ago, and that they 
will adopt the most effectual measures in their power to render am- 
ple justice to you for your faithful and meritorious services. And 
let me conjure you in the name of our common country, as you 
value your own sacred honor, as you respect the rights of humanity, 
and as you regard the military and natiomd character of America, 
to express your utmost horror and detestation of the man, who 
wishes, under any specious pretences, to overturn the liberties of 
our country, and who wickedly attempts to open the flood-gates of 
civil discord, and deluge our rising empire in blood. 

" By thus determining and thus acting, you will pursue the plain 
and direct road to the attainment of your wishes ; you will defeat 
the insidious designs of our enemies, who are compelled to resort 
from open force to secret artifice ; you will give one more distin- 
guished proof of unexampled patriotism and patient virtue, rising 
superior to the pressure of the most complicated sufferings ; and 
you will, by the dignity of your conduct, afford occasion for pos- 
terity to say, when sj)eaking of the glorious example you have ex- 
hibited to mankind, ' Had this day been wanting, the world had 
never seen the last stage of perfection, to which human nature is 
capable of attaining.' " 



564 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

After reading the address the Commander-in-chief retired, and 
the following resolutions were adopted. 

" On motion made by General Knox, and seconded by General 
Putnam, 

" Resolved, That tlie unanimous thanks of the officers of the 
army be presented to his Excellency, the Commander-in-chief, for 
his excellent address, and the communications he has been pleased 
to make to them ; and to assure him, that the officers reciprocate 
his affijctionate expressions, with the greatest sincerity of wliich 
the human heart is capable. 

" The address from the army to Congress, the report of the 
committee from the army, and the resolutions of Congress of the 
25th of January being read, on a motion by General Putnam, sec- 
onded by General Hand, 

" Voted, That a committee be appointed immediately to draw 
up some resolutions expressive of the business before us, and re- 
port in half an hour ; that the committee consist of one general, 
one field-officer, and one captain. 

" That General Knox, Colonel Brooks, and Captain Howard, 
compose the said committee. 

" The report of the committee having been brought in and fully 
considered, 

" Resolved unanimously, That at the commencement of the pres- 
ent war, the officers of the American army engaged in the ser- 
vice of their country from the purest love and attachment to the 
rights and liberties of human nature ; which motives still exist in 
the liighest degree; and that no circumstance of distress or dan- 
ger shall induce a conduct, that may tend to sully the reputation 
and glory, which they have acquired at the price of their blood 
and eight years' faithful services. 

" Resolved unanimously, That the army continue to have an 
unshaken confidence in the justice of Congress and their country ; 
and are fully convinced, that the representatives of America will 
not disband or disperse the army until their accounts are liquidat- 
ed, the balances accurately ascertained, and adequate funds es- 
tablished for payment. And, in this arrangement, the officers ex- 
pect that the half-pay, or commutation of it, should be efficaciously 
comprehended. 

"Resolved unanimously. That his Excellency the Commander- 
in-chief be requested to write to his Excellency the President of 
Congress, earnestly entreating the more speedy decision of that 
honorable body upon the subjects of our late address, which was

forwarded by a committee of tlie army, some of whom arc wait- 
ing ii(H>ii CoiigrcM.s for ihe result. In tlie alternative of peace- or 
war, thii) event would be highly sati:jfactory, and would produce 
immediate tranquillity in the minds of the army, and |)revent any 
further machinations of designing men to sow discord between the 
civil and nniitary [xjwers of the United States. 

" Resolved unanimously, That the otiiccrs of the American ar- 
my view with abhorrence, and reject with disdain, the infamous 
proiX)sitions contained in a late anonymous address to the otficers 
of the army, and resent with indignation the secret attempts of 
some unknown persons to collect the officers together in a mun- 
ner totally subversive of all discipline and good order. 

" Resolved unanimously, That the thanks of the oflicers of the 
army be given to the committee, who presented to Congress the 
late iiddress of the army, for the wisdom and prudence with which 
they have conducted that business ; and that a copy of the pro- 
ceedings of this day be transtnitted by the President to Major- 
Gencr;d AIcDougall, and that he be requested to continue his so- 
licitations at Congress until the objects of his mission are accom- 
plished." 

These proceedings were signed by General Gates, as president 
of the meeting, and on the 18th the approbation of General Wash- 
ington was expressed in public orders as follows. 

" The Commander-in-chief is highly satisfied with the report of 
the proceedings of the otlicers assembled on the 15th instant, in 
obedience to the orders of the 11th. He begs his inability to com- 
municate an adequate idea of the pleasing feelings, which have 
been excited in his breast by the affectionate sentiments express- 
ed towards him on that occasion, may be considered as an apol- 
ogy for his silence." 

The result of the proceedings and the above papers were trans- 
mitted to Congress, and the doings of that body on the subject 
of the complaints of the army may be seen in the Journals, un- 
der the date of .March '2-2d, 1783. 

The anonymous notification and addres.ses were circulated among 
the officers in manuscript. The originals were carried by a ma- 
jor, who was a deputy inspector under Baron Steuben, to the ad- 
jutant-general's office, where were every morning assembled aid.s- 
de-camp, majors of brigades, and adjutants of regiments, all of 
whom, that chose to do so, took copies and circulated them.

Among the transcribers was the adjutant of the General's guard, 
who probably furnished the copies, that were transmitted to Con- 
gress. By this process some slight errors doubtless slipped into the 
transcripts; but it has never been said, that the sense of the original 
was altered. They are here reprinted from the copies contained 
in the Journals of Congress, which, as they were published under 
the sanction of that body, must be considered as having all the 
authenticity, that the nature of the case admits. They also agree 
very exactly with the copies preserved among the papers of the 
Commander-in-chief, there being no other variation than a change 
in two or three unimportant words, apparently through negligence 
in transcribing or printing. 

Whatever may have been thought by General Washington at 
the time, as to the character and objects of the Newburg Ad- 
dresses, it appears by the following letter, that he was afterwards 
led to form a different opinion of the motives of the author from 
that expressed in his Address to the Officers. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

" Philadelphia, 23 February, 1797. 
" Sir, 

" Believing that there may be times and occasions, on which 
my opinion of the anonymous letters and their author, as delivered 
to the army in the year 1783, may be turned to some personal 
and malignant purpose, I do hereby declare, that I did not, at the 
time of writing my address, regard you as the author of the said 
letters; and further, that I have since had sufficient reason for be- 
lieving, that the object of the author was just, honorable, and 
friendly to the country, though the means suggested by him were 
certainly liable to much misunderstanding and abuse. 

"I am, Sir, with great regard, your most obedient servant, 

" George Washington."

ANNOUNCING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. 



Head-Quarters, Id April, 1783. 

Till' Commander-in-chief orders the cessation of hostilities, l)e- 
tvveen the United States of .\mericn and the Kinij of (ireat Britain, 
to be publicly proclaimed to-morrow at twelve at the New Building; 
and that the proclamation, which will be communicated herewith, 
be read to-morrow evening at the head of every regiment and 
corps of the army ; after which the chaplains with the several 
brigades will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies, 
particularly for his overruling the wrath of man to his own glory, 
and causing the rage of war to cease among the nations. 

Although the proclamation before alluded to extends oidy to the 
prohibition of hostilities, and not to the annunciation of a general 
peace, yet it must afford the most rational and sincere satisfaction 
to every benevolent mind, as it |)uts a period to a long and doubt- 
ful contest, stops the cllusion of human blood, opens the prospect 
to a more splendid scene, and, like another morning star, promises 
the approach of a brighter day than has hitherto illuminated the 
western hemisphere. On such a happy day, which is the harbinger 
of peace, a day which completes the eighth year of the war, it 
would l)c ingratitude not to rejoice ; it would be insensibility not 
to participate in the general felicity. 

The Commander-in-chief, far from endeavouring to stifle the 
feelings of joy in his own bosom, offers his most cordial congratu- 
lations on the occasion to all the odicers of every denomination, 
to all the troops of the United States in general, and in particular 
to those gallant and persevering men, who had resolved to defend 
the rights of their invaded country so long as the war should con- 
tinue. For these are the men, who ought to be considered as the 
pride and boast of the American army ; and who, crowned with 
well-earned laurels, may soon withdraw from tiie field of glory to 
the more tranquil walks of civil life. 

While the General recollects the almost infinite variety of scenes 
through which we have passed, with a mixture of pleasure, aston- 
ishment, and gratitude ; while he contemplates the prospect before 
us with rapture, he cannot help wishing that all the brave men 
(of whatever condition they may be), who have shared in the toils

and dangers of effecting this glorious revolution, of rescuing mil- 
lions from the hand of oppression, and of laying the foundation of 
a great empire, might be impressed with a proper idea of the dig- 
nified part they have been called to act (under the smiles of Provi- 
dence) on the stage of human affairs. For happy, thrice happy, 
shall they be pronounced hereafter, who have contributed any 
thing, who have performed the meanest office, in erecting this stu- 
pendous fabric of freedom and e/iipire on the broad basis of inde- 
pendency ; who have assisted in protecting the rights of human 
nature, and establishing an asylum for the poor and oppressed of 
all nations and religions. 

The glorious task for which we first flew to arms being thus ac- 
complished ; the liberties of our country being fully acknowledged 
and firmly secured by the smiles of Heaven on the purity of our 
cause, and the honest exertions of a feeble people determined to 
be free, against a powerful nation disposed to oppress them ; and 
the character of those, who have persevered through every extremity 
of hardship, suffering, and danger, being immortalized by the illus- 
trious appellation of the patriot army, nothing now remains but for 
the actors of this mighty scene to preserve a perfect unvarying con- 
sistency of character through the very last act, to close the drama 
with applause, and to retire from the military theatre with the same 
approbation of angels and men, which has crowned all their former 
virtuous actions. For this purpose no disorder or licentiousness 
must be tolerated. Every considerate and well-disposed soldier 
must remember, it will be absolutely necessary to wait with pa- 
tience until peace shall be declared, or Congress shall be enabled 
to take proper measures for the security of the public stores. As 
soon as these arrangements shall be made, the General is confi- 
dent there will be no delay in discharging, with every mark of dis- 
tinction and honor, all the men enlisted for the war, who will then 
have faithfully performed their engagements with the public. The 
General has already interested himself in their behalf, and he 
thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his disposition to be 
useful to them on the present and every other proper occasion. In 
the mean time, he is determined that no military neglects or ex- 
cesses shall go unpunished while he retains the command of the 
army.

ORDKR OF TflE PUBLIC AUDIENCK OF GKNKIIAL VVASJIING- 
TON IN CO.NGRESS. AND THE i'llKSIDENTS ANSWER TO 
lUS AOUHESS ON RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION. 

A committee, consisting of Mr. Jeflerson, Mr. Gerry, and Mr. 
McHenry, was appointed by Congress to make suital)lo arrange- 
ments for the last public audience of General VVa.sliiiigton. In 
conformity with their report it was resolved, on the SSd of De- 
cember, that the ceremony should be conducted as follows. 

" 1. The President and members are to be seated and cov- 
ered, and the Secretary to be standin;; by the side of the President. 

" 2. The arrival of the General is to be announced by the mes- 
senger to the Secretary, who is thereupon to introduce the Gen- 
eral, attended by his aids, into the Ilall of Congress. 

" 3. The General, being conducted to a chair by the Secretary, 
is to be seated, with an aid on each side standing, and the Sec 
retary is to resume his place. 

" 4. After a proper time for the arrnngomcnt of spectators, si- 
lence is to be ordered by the Surretary if neces.sary, and the Presi- 
dent is to address the General in the following words. ' Sir ; The 
United States in Congress assembled are prepared to receive your 
communications.' Whereupon the General is to arise and address 
Congress ; after which he is to deliver his commission and a copy 
of his address to the President. 

" 5. The General having resumed his pl.icc, the President is 
to deliver the answer of Congress, which the General is to receive 
standing. 

" 6. The President having finished, the Secretary is to deliver 
the General a copy of the answer, and the General is then to take 
his leave. When the General rises to make his address, and also 
when he retires, he is to bow to Congress, which they are to re- 
turn by uncovering without bowing." 

According to this order General Washington was introduced to 
Congress, and pronounced his address. He then advanced and 
delivered to the President his commission and a copy of his ad- 
dress, and having resumed his place, the President returned (ho

570 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

"Sir, 

" The United States, in Congress assembled, receive with emo- 
tions too affecting fur utterance, the solemn resignation of the au- 
thorities under which you have led their troops with success through 
a perilous and a doubtful war. Called upon by your country to 
defend its invaded rights, you accepted the sacred charge, before 
it had formed alliances, and whilst it was without funds or a gov- 
ernment to support you. You have conducted the great military 
contest with wisdom and fortitude, invariably regarding the rights 
of the civil power through all disasters and changes. You have, 
by the love and confidence cf your fellow citizens, enabled them to 
display their martial genius, and transmit their fame to posterity. 
You have persevered, till these United States, aided by a magnani- 
mous King and nation, have been enabled under a just Providence 
to close the war in freedom, safety, and independence ; on which 
happy event we sincerely join you in congratulations. 

" Having defended the standard of liberty in this new world, hav- 
ing taught a lesson useful to those who inflict, and to those who 
feel oppression, you retire from the great theatre of action with the 
blessings of your fellow citizens ; but the glory of your virtues will 
not terminate with your military command, it will continue to ani- 
mate remotest ages. 

" We feel with you our obligations to the army in general, and 
will particularly charge ourselves with the interests of those con- 
fidential officers, who have attended your person to this affecting 
moment. 

" We join you in commending the interests of our dearest country 
to the protection of Almighty God, beseeching him to dispose the 
hearts and minds of its citizens to improve the opportunity af- 
forded them of becoming a happy and respectable nation. And for 
you we address to him our earnest prayers, that a life so beloved 
may be fostered with all his care, that your days may be liappy as 
they have been illustrious, and that he will finally give you that 
reward, which this world cannot give."

GENEIl.\L WASHINGTON'S KXPENSKS WIIIMO ACTING AS 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE AMEIIICAN ARMIES. 

Accoriliiii,' U) hi.s ileclaralioii when he iicccpted his coimnission, 
General Washington never received any pecuniary compensation 
for his services. He kept exact accounts of all his c.\i)en(liturcs ; 
and, after the cessation of hostilities, he drew up with liis own 
hand a detailed statement of these accounts, extending to more 
than sixty folio pages. This statement, with the original vouchers, 
was dc[X)sitcd in the Treasury Doparlincnt, where it is still pre- 
served. A fiic-simile of the whole paper has been pulilished ; and 
it affords a memorable proof of the strict regard, which he paid to 
the public interest in the minutest particulars. The following 
abstract and remarks arc taken frimi the original, dated July 1st, 
1783, as exhibited in his own liiiii<iwritiiig, and expressed m law- 
ful money, or the old currency of Massachusetts and Virginia.

ance due to him on the 31st of December, 1770, the amount

the preceding year. On this item, and the one respecting Mrs. 
Washington's travelling expenses, he made the following remarks 
at the foot of the account. 

" Although I kept memoranda of these expenditures, I did not 
introduce them into my public accounts as they occurred. The 
reason was, it appeared at first view in the commencement of them 
to have the complexion of a private charge. I had my doubts, 
therefore, of the propriety of making it. But, as the peculiar cir- 
cumstances attending my command, and the embarrassed situation 
of our public affairs, obliged me (to the no small detriment of my 
private interest) to postpone the visit I every year contemplated to 
make my family between the close of one campaign and the open- 
ing of another ; and as this expense was incidental thereto, and 
consequent of my self-denial, I have, as of right I think I ought, 
with due consideration, adjudged the charge as just with respect 
to the public, as it is convenient with respect to myself 

"And I make it with the less reluctance, as I find upon the 
final adjustment of these accounts (which have, as will appear, 
been long unsettled), that I am a considerable loser; my disburse- 
ments falling a good deal short of my receipts and the money I 
had upon hand of my own. For, besides the sum I carried with 
me to Cambridge in 177.5, and which exceeded the aforementioned 
balance of ^599 19 11, I received moneys afterwards on private 
account in 1777 and since, which, except small sums that I had 
occasion now and then to apply to private uses, were all expended 
in the public service ; and which, through hurry, I suppose, and 
the perplexity of business, (for I know not how else to account 
for the deficiency,) 1 have omitted to charge, whilst every debit 
against me is here credited."
