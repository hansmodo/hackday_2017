EXTRACTS FROM INTERCEPTED LETTERS WRITTEN BY LORD GEORGE GERMAIN TO SIR HENRY CLINTON.' 

Whitehall, 7 February, 1781. 

— It gives his Majesty particular satisfaction to find, that you had 
determined to replace Major-General Leslie's detachment in Eliza- 
beth River by one under Brigadier-General Arnold, with positive 
orders to establish a permanent post there. I learn with great 
pleasure from private letters of the ~'2i\ of December, that you 
were preparing a very considerable body of troops for immediate 
embarkation, which I flatter myself, from an expression in one of 
your letters to Vice-Admiral Arbuthnot, will be employed in con- 
junction with the Loyal As.sociators of Maryland and Pcnnsvlvania, 
in reducing those provinces to the King's obedience, while Lord 
Cornwallis and Brigadier-General Arnold subdue Virginia ; for such 
is bcvDiid all doubt the low condition of the Congress's authority 
and fmances, and so weak is the state of ^Vashington's army, that 

" The lelter«, from which these extracts are taken, were captured at sea on 
board a packet ship from Falmouth, and were traHBinilled to Congress.

little oppositioa is to be expected in that quarter, and none that 
can resist such a force as, without the least hazard to New York 
or Charleston, may be assembled there. You were perfectly rio-ht 
in your interpretation of the Vice-Admiral's orders for detaching five 
ships to the West Indies, and I was happy to find he acquiesced 
in your judgment upon that occasion. 

The return of the people of Vermont to their allegiance is an 
event of the utmost importance to the King's affairs, and at this 
time, if the French and Washington really meditate an irruption 
into Canada, may be considered as opposing an insurmountable bar 
to the attempt. General Haldimand, who had the same instruc- 
tions with you to draw over those people, and give them support, 
will, 1 doubt not, push up a body of troops to act in conjunction 
with them to secure all the avenues from their country into Canada, 
and, when the season admits, take possession of the upper parts 
of Hudson and Connecticut Rivers, and cut oil" the communication 
between Albany and tiie Mohawk country. How far they may be 
able to extend themselves to the- southward and eastward, must de- 
pend upon their number and the disposition of the inliabitants ; 
but, if Albany should take part with them, the inducement to at- 
tempt to open a communication with them by Hudson's River will 
appear irresistible to people here. 

I am sorry I cannot inform you, that the transports with the re- 
cruits are sailed from Cork, where the three regiments are in readi- 
ness to join them, but a long continuance of easterly winds first 
prevented the ships from getting round to Portsmouth, and now the 
westerly winds detain them there ; but they are all at Spithead with 
their convoy, ready to put to sea the moment the wind will permit 
them to sail. The ordnance store-ship, which has five thousand 
stands of arms on board for Carolina, being still in the river, I 
have ordered three thousand stands to be sent by land-carriage to 
Portsmouth, and there distributed on board the transports, as 1 
understand they are much wanted among the loyalists. They are 
addressed to the commander of the forces in South Carolina.

Wlnteliall, 7 March, I7S1. 
Sir, 

Since my letter to you of the Tth of February, I have received 
your despatches, and laid them before the King. 

The revolt of the Pennsylvania line and Jersey brigade, though 
not attended with all the good consequences that might have been 
expected, are certainly events of very great importance, and must

have vcrv extensive effects, Ixith in reducing Washington's present 
force, and preventing its l)cing recruited by new levies ; and, as I 
douitt not you will avail yourself of his weakness, and your own 
great su|K'riority, to send a considerate force to the head of the 
Chesapeake as soon as the season will permit operations to be car- 
ried on in that quarter, I flatter myself the southern provinces will 
be recovered to his Majesty's ol>edience before the long promised 
succours, none of which are yet sailed, can arrive from France ; 
and that Mr. Washington, unable to draw subsistence for his troops 
from the west side of Hudson's River, will be compelled to cross 
it and take refuge in the eastern provinces. 

I am very anxious to hear of Lord Cornwailis's progress since 
General Leslie joined him. I have no doubt his movements will 
bo rapid and decisive, for his Lordship appears to be fully impressed 
with llie absolute necessity of vigorous exertions in the service of 
this country in its present circumstances. The success of Gen- 
eral Arnold's enterprise up James River, which the rebel news- 
papers confirm, must greatly facilitate his Lordship's operations, by 
cutting off Greene's supplies and obliging the militia to return to 
take care of their own property. Indeed, so very contemptible is 
the rebel force now in all parts, and so vast is our superiority every- 
where, that no resistance on their part is to be apprehended, that 
can materially obstruct the progress of the King's arms in the speedy 
suppression of the rebellion ; and it is a pleasing, though at the 
same time a mortifying reflection, when the duration of the rebel- 
lion is considered, which arises from a view of the returns of the 
provincial forces you have transmitted, that the American levies in 
the Kinc's service arc more in number, than the whole of the en- 
listed troops in the service of the Congress. 

I am very glad to find you have commissioned a Board of Di- 
rectors of the Refugees, and I hope the admiral will have been able 
to spare them shipping to carry on their operations on the seacoast 
of the New England provinces. Many of those within the lines, 
who are unfit for military service, are desirous of being settled in 
the country about Penobscot, and require only to be supplied with 
provisions for the first year, some tools for husbandry, and iron- 
work for their buildings ; and, as it is proposed to settle that coun- 
try, and this appears a cheap method of disposing of these loyalists, 
it is wished you would encourage them to go there under the pro- 
tection of the A.ssociated Refugees, and assure them that a civil 
government will follow I hem in due time ; for I hope, in the course 
of the summer, the admiral and you will be able to spare a force

sufficient to effect an establishment at Casco Bay, and reduce that 
country to the King's obedience. 

I am very glad to find, by the list of the officers released, that 
the exchanges have been carried so far ; but, as it appears from 
Mr. Washington's last letter to you, that they will not be carried 
on further, the measure of enlisting their prisoners for service in 
the West Indies should be adopted immediately ; and, indeed, such 
has been the mortality from sickness among the troops there, that 
I do not see any other means of recruiting them. 

I am sorry to acquaint you, that the general prevalence of 
westerly winds for these last two months has prevented the War- 
wick and Solebay, with their convoy, from getting further than 
Plymouth, where they are still detained. —

LETTER FROM COUNT DE URASSE TO C O U iN T D E R C H A M B E A U . 

At the Cape (St. Domingo), 8 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have seen with regret the distress, which prevails on the con- 
tinent, and the necessity of the prompt succours you solicit. 1 
have conferred with M. de Lillancourt, who took command of the 
government here on the day of my arrival, and engaged him to 
furnish from the garrison of St. Domingo a detachment from the 
regiments of Gatinois, Agenois, and Tourraine, amounting in all to 
three thousand men, one hundred artillery, one hundred dragoons, 
ten pieces of field ordnance, and several of siege artillery and mor- 
tars. The whole will be embarked in vessels of war, from twenty- 
five to twenty-nine in number, which will depart from this colony 
on the 13th of August, and proceed directly to the Chesapeake 
Bay, which place seems to be indicated by yourself, General Wash- 
ington, M. de la Luzerne, and Count de Barras, as the best point 
of operation for accomplishing the object proposed. 

I have likewise done all in my power to procure for you the 
sum of twelve hundred thousand livre.s, which you say is abso- 
lutely necessary. This colony is not in a condition to afford you 
such a supply ; but I shall obtain it from Havana, whither a frigate will be sent fur llio |nir(M)s<', aiid yoii in.iy depend on receiving that amount. 

As neither mysell", nor the troops commanded by the Marquis 
dc St. Simon, can remain on the continent after the l.jtli of Oc- 
tober, I shall be greatly obliged to you if you will employ mo 
promptly and etFecttially within that time, whether against the 
maritime or land forces of our enemy. It will not be possible for 
me to leave the troo|>s with you beyond that period ; fir.-it, because 
part of them are under the orders of the Spanish generals, and 
have been obtained only on the promise, that they shall be re- 
turned by the time they will be wanted ; and, secondly, because 
the other part are destined to the garrison of St. Domingo, and 
cannot be spared from that duty by M. de Lillancourt. The en- 
tire expedition, in regard to these trcxjps, has been concerted only 
in consequence of your request, without even the previous knowl- 
edge of the ministers of France and Spain. I have thought myself 
authorized to assume this responsibility for the common cause ; but 
I should not dare so far to change the plans they have adopted, 
as to remove so considerable a body of troops. 

You clearly perceive the necessity of making the best use of 
the time, that will remain for action. I hope the frigate, which 
takes this letter, will have such despatch, that every thing may be 
got in readiness by the time of my arrival, and that we may pro- 
ceed immediately to fulfil the designs in view, the success of 
which I ardently desire. I have the honor to be, &c.

LETTER FROM CAPTAIN AFFLECK TO GENERAL WASHLNGTON RESPECTLNG MARINE PRISONERS. 

New York, 30 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I intend not either to deny or to assert, for it will neither fa- 
cilitate business nor alleviate distress. The subject of your letter 
seems to turn upon two points, namely, the inconveniences and 
distresses, which the American prisoners suffer from the inade- 
quacy of room in the prison-ships, which occasions the death of 
many of them, as you are told ; and that a commi.ssary-general 



524 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 



of prisoners from you shall have liberty to visit the ships, inspect 
the situation of the prisoners, and make a report from an actual 
survey. 

I take leave to assure you, that I feel for the distresses of man- 
kind as much as any man ; and, since my coming to the naval 
command in this department, one of my principal endeavours has 
been to regulate the prison and hospital ships. The government 
having made no other provision for naval prisoners than shipping, 
it is impossible that the greater inconvenience, which people con- 
fined on board ships experience beyond those confined on shore, 
can be avoided, and a sudden accumulation of people often ag- 
gravates the evil. But I assure you, tliat every attention is shown 
that is possible, and that the prison-ships are under the very same 
regulations here, that have been constantly observed towards the 
prisoners of all nations in Europe. Tables of diet are publicly af- 
fixed, officers visit every week, redress and report grievances, and 
the numbers are thinned as they can provide shipping, and no at- 
tention has been wanting. 

The latter point cannot be admitted in its full extent ; but, if 
you think fit to send an officer of character to the lines for that 
purpose, he will be conducted to me, and he shall be accompa- 
nied by an officer, and become a witness of the manner in which 
we treat the prisoners. And I shall expect to have my officer 
visit the prisoners detained in your jails and dungeons in like 
manner, as well as in the mines, where I am informed many an 
unhappy victim languishes out his days. I must remark, had 
Congress ever been inclined, they might have contributed to re- 
lieve the distresses of those we are under the necessity of hold- 
ing as prisoners, by sending in all in their possession towards the 
payment of the large debt they owe us on that head, which might 
have been an inducement towards liberating many now in cap- 
tivity. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, with due respect, &,c.

THE .MA II QUI 3 DE LAFAYETTE. 

Venuiillcs, 10 March, 1761. 
Sir, 

I have received the letter, which you did me the honor to write 
to me on the Kith of last December, and have deferred answer- 
ing it, because the subject required delil)eralii)iis, which we have 
been obliged from various circumstances to delay. 

The Kinc; ha.s just determined on the succours of different kinds, 
with which the Americans are to be rurnishcd for the ensuing 
campaign. I ."hall not give you a detailed account of them, as I 
am transmitting one to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, who, I have 
no doubt, will comnuniicatc it to you.* I have reason to believe, 
that Uener.il Washington will be satisfied with our efforts for the 
support of the American cause, and that, on his part, he will do ev- 
ery thing in his power to render them available. I beg that you 
will a.Hsure him of the entire confidence, which we place in his 
zeal, patriotism, and talents, and that we shall sincerely rejoice 
when he shall have acquired the glory of having delivered his 
country and secured her liberties. 

I hope that the disturbance in the American army has been en- 
tirely quelled, as a renewal of the scenes .icted in the Pennsylvania 



* .Among oilier aids for the year 17dl, the Flench King resolved to grant to 
the United States a subsidy of six millions of livre^. The ministry, designing 
tliis money for a special succour to the army, proposed, that, alter a certain 
portion had been paid for military articles purchased in Europe, the remainder 
should be at the disposal of General Washington, and disbursed in such a 
manner as he should think best for the general good. This idea was ex- 
presiscd lo Dr. Franklin, and he communicated it to Congress. The jealousy 
and fears of that body were immediately alarmed. They were not satisfied that 
the head of the army should possess such an agent, in addition to his military 
power. M. de la Luzerne was at first a little concerned .it this uneasines.s, as 
it was mingled with latent suspicions of the design of the French court, in 
nuking this disposition of the money ; but luckily he discovered in Tounl de 
VergenncsB letter to him, that General Washington, " or some other person," 
was indicated. He immediately removed the anxieties of Congress by com- 
municating this fact, and informing them that the money was within Iheir 
control. Not long afterwards he saw General Washington, who thanked him 
cordially for his interference, and for thus relieving him from a very respon- 
sible task, which he had no desire to perform, and which would excite the 
jealousy of his enemies. 



line would be very dangerous, and would probably frustrate the 
most vigorous and best concerted plans. Clotliing tor your troops 
will arrive, and 1 trust you will also receive a further supply. This 
article appears to me tlie most important, as well as the most ur- 
gent. I have the honor to be, &.c.

Versailles, liJ April, 1781. 
Sir, 

Your description of the situation of the Americans is very dis- 
tressing, and, from the previous accounts of the Chevalier de la 
Luzerne, we have felt the immediate necessity of affording them 
further assistance. You may confide to General Washington, that 
the King has determined to pledge himself for a loan of ten mil- 
lions, which is about to be negotiated in Holland in favor of the 
United States. Thus, Sir, by the close of this year, his Majesty 
will have given, or lent to the Americans, the sum of twenty mil- 
lions. I venture to believe, that the General will feel the extent 
and importance of such a service, especially when he takes into 
consideration, as he should do, the maintenance of a squadron and 
a body of troops, which the King has placed at his disposal, and the 
heavy expenses of a war, which we sustain only for the sake of the 
Americans, 

Congress had fixed their wants and their demands at twenty-five 
millions. I am willing to admit the correctness of this estimate ; 
but the King must consider, on his side, the compass of his means. 
You may easily conceive, that they are absorbed by the great ex- 
penses demanded by our efforts for the American cause. I beg you 
to impress on General Washington the force of this idea. He is 
too enlightened not to perceive it strongly, or to admit any other 
sentiments than those of gratitude. I have done all in my power to 
awaken these in his aid-de-camp, but without success. Mr. Lau- 
rens is not without zeal, but I confess that he has hardly manifested 
it in the manner required by his commission. We have taken no 
exception at it, because we have attributed the conduct of Mr. Lau- 
rens merely to his inexperience in affairs. I think it necessary to 
speak of this officer, because it is possible, that, displeased at not 
having obtained all that he demanded, or rather exacted, namely, 
arms, clothing, ammunition, and twenty-five millions besides, he 
may be somewhat partial in the account he gives to his General ; 
and I think it my duty to afford you the means of counteracting 
any prejudices, which he might receive from it. For the rest, 
Mr. Laurens has been well received by all the ministers of the 



AiMT.MMx.) VKRGKNNKS AND I, A F A V KTT K. 527 

King, ami I lM>lievc that he will in this respect express himself 
perfectly satisfied.* 

The ample supplies, with which the King fiiriiislios tiic Ameri- 
cans, authorize him to expect, that they will exert the greatest en- 
ergy ill the operations of the approaching campaign. I beg that 
you will mention to General Washington, that his Majesty has in 
this respect the greatest confidence in his experience, activity, and 
patriotism. I have nothing to add to the communications in my 
last li'ttiT concerning our operations. Our arrangements will re- 
main as I have transmitted them to the Chevalier de la Luzerne. 

Finally, Sir, if the war, as appears probable, is prolonged beyond 
the present campaign, I hope that we shall not be called on with 
similar demands. I forewarn you, that it would be iitiitf impossible 
to satisfy them. France is by no means an inexhaustible mine. 

I have the honor to be, &.c.

Versailles, 11 May, 17S1. 

SiK, 

I had forgotten to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 
4th of last October. My letter of the 19th of April replies to nearly 
all the points on which it touches. Mr. Laurens is on the eve of 
his departure, lie has converted a part of the money, given by his 
Majesty, into arms, clothing, and ammunition. We are waiting the 
result of a loan of ten millions, negotiating in Holland. It cannot 
be obtained in the name of the Americans, and the King, to attain 
his desire of obliging them, has resolved to come forward as prin- 
cipal negotiator. I beg that you will acquaint General Washington 
with this circumstance. 

Notwithstanding the great efforts we are making for the United 
States, Mr. Laurens is not satisfied. This oliicer has treated me 
with great neglect since I announced to him the determination of

his Majesty. I know that his complaints have been highly indis- 
creet, and I apprehend that he will do every thing in his power to 
prejudice his General. I beg you to inform the latter of this, and 
to induce him to advise his aid-de-camp, and above all, to impress 
hira with the necessity of rendering to Congress the most exact ac- 
count of the mission in France, which has been confided to him. 
I trust that we shall not again receive similar messages. France is 
not inexhaustible, and it would be impossible to attend to them. 
We are doing much for the Americans, but they must also exert 
themselves. We are waiting with great impatience for news from 
your quarter. We have learnt as yet only by the English gazettes, 
that a naval combat has taken place off the Capes of Virginia ; but 
they do not mention whether our troops have disembarked, nor what 
has become of M. Destouches. It is affirmed, that you are block- 
aded at Annapolis by several frigates. I am very anxious to hear 
that this intelligence is without foundation, and that you have 
reached your destination in safety. Finally, 1 have nothing new to 
add to the information of my preceding letters, respecting the ope- 
rations of the ensuing campaign. God grant that the Americans 
may at length put forth all the energy of which they are capable. 
It will be the surest means of obtaining a speedy peace.

LETTER FROM COUNT DE GRASSE TO GENERAL WASHINGTON, CONCERNING OPERATIONS IN THE CHESAPEAKE. 

Cape Henry, 2,3 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

The intelligence, which your Excellency has sent to me by the 
aid-de-camp of Count de Rochambcau, is most distressing. I know 
but little of the evil and the progress, which this operation may 
effect, but I perceive that our position is changed by the arrival 
of Admiral Digby. 

The enemy is now nearly equal to us in strength, and it would be 
imprudent in me to place myself in a situation, that would prevent 
my attacking them, should they attempt to afford succour. I have 
the honor, therefore, to propose to your Excellency that I should 
leave two vessels at the mouth of York River, and draw around me all the rest, excepting the corvettes and frigates, wiiich have been 
blockading Joincs River since my arrival, and wliicli are the Char- 
lotte, the Corinornnl, the Sandwich, and one other frigate. The 
rest I shall bring together, in order to sail and keep the sea, that in 
case the enemy attempt to force the passage, 1 may attack them in 
a less disadvantageous position. But it is possible, that the issue 
of the combat may force us to leeward, and dcjjrive us of the power 
of returning. Under these circumstances, what could you do, what 
would be your resources f I cannot sacrifice the army under my 
command, and my present position is neither favorable for attack- 
ing, nor secure in case of a gale. 

The anchorage at York, on which we were agreed, does not ap- 
pear more suitable, considering the maritime forces of the enemy ; 
because it would place me in a very unfavorable position, and would 
have no elFect in preventing the reinforcement from entering. I 
see no resource but the oiling, and possibly that may not leave me 
free to return within the Capes. I shall wait impatiently for your 
answer, and that of M. de Rochambeau, to whom this letter is 
addressed in common with you. I beg you to communicate it to 
him, and to .send your advice and opinions on the subject. 

If my troops, or those of M. de St. Simon, remain with you, the 
two vessels and the corvettes at James River will be sufficient for 
you. I will sail with my forces towards New York, and I may 
possibly do more for the common cause than by remaining here an 
idle spectator. If the enemy do not come out, it is evidently be- 
cause they dare not. We shall then consider what course to take. 
In the mean time you will push Cornwallis vigorously, and we will 
act in concert, each on his own side. I have the honor to be, 
with respectful consideration, &.c.

GeNER.\L WASHINGTON TO EARL COKNWALLIS. 

Camp, before York, 18 October, 17dl. 
.Mv Lord, 

To avoid unnecessary discussion and delays, 1 shall at once, 
in answer to your Lordship's letters of yesterday, declare the gen- 
eral basis upon which a definitive treaty and capitulation must take 
place. The garrisons of York and Gloucester, including the sea- 
men, as you propose, will be received prisoners of war. The con- 
dition annexed, of sending the British and German troops to the 
parts of Europe to which ihey respectively belong, is inadmissible. 
Instead of this, they will be marched to such parts of the country 
as can most conveniently provide for their subsistence ; and the 
benevolent treatment of prisoners, which is invariably observed by 
the Americans, will be extended to tlieni. The same honors will 
be granted to the surrendering army as were granteil to the gar- 
rison of Charleston. The shipping and boats in the two harbours, 
with all their guns, stores, tackling, furniture, and apparel, shall be 
delivered in their present state to an olFicer of the navy, appoint- 
ed to take possession of them. 

The artillery, arms, accoutrements, military chest, and public 
stores of every denomination, sh.ill be delivered unimpaired to the 
beads of the departments, to which they respectively belong. 

The officers will be indulged in retaining their side-arms ; and 
the officers and soldiers may preserve their baggage and effiicts ; 
with this reserve, that property taken in the country will be re- 
claimed. 

With regard to individuals in civil capacities, whose interest 
your Lordship wishes may be attended to, until they are more par- 
ticularlv described, nothing definitive can be settled. 

I have to add, that I expect the sick and wounded will be sup- 
plied with their own hospital stores, and be attended by British 
surgeons, particularly charged with the care of them.

capitulation for the surrender of Gloucester in its present state of 
defence. 

I shall in particular desire, that the Bonctta sloop-of-war may be 
left entirely at my disposal, from the hour that the capitulation is 
signed, to receive an aid-de-camp to carry my despatches to Sir 
Henry Clinton. Such soldiers as I may think proper to send as 
passengers in her, to be manned with fifty men of her own crew, 
and to be permitted to sail without examination, when my de- 
spatches are ready ; engaging on my part, that the ship shall be 
brought back and delivered to you, if she escapes the dangers of 
the sea, that the crew and soldiers shall be accounted for in future 
exchanges, that she shall carry off no officer without your consent, 
nor public property of any kind ; and I shall likewise desire, that 
the traders and inhabitants may preserve their property, and that no 
person may be punished or molested for having joined the British 
troops. 

If you choose to proceed to negotiation on these grounds, I shall 
appoint two field-officers of my army to meet two oilicers from you, 
at any time and place that you think proper, to digest the arti- 
cles of capitulation. I have the honor to be, &c.

LETTERS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS FROM SIR GUY CARLETON TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

Head-Quurters, New York, 7 May, 1762. 

Sir, 

Having been appointed by his Majesty to the command of the 
forces on the Atlantic Ocean, and joined with Admiral Digby in 
the commission of peace, I find it proper in this manner to apprize 
your Excellency of my arrival at New York. 

The occasion. Sir, seems to render this communication proper, 
but the circumstances of the present time render it also indispensa- 
ble ; as I find it just to transmit herewith to your Excellency cer- 
tain papers, from the perusal of which your Excellency will per- 
ceive what dispositions prevail in the government and people of 
England towards those of America, and what further effects are 
likely to follow. If the like pacific dispositions should prevail in 
this country, both my inclination and duty will lead me to meet it 
with tiie most zealous concurrence. In all events, Sir, it is with 
me to declare, that, if war must prevail I shall endeavour to render 
its miseries as light to the people of this continent, as the circum- 
stances of such a condition will possibly permit. 

I am much concerned to find, that private and unauthorized 
persons have on both sides given way to those passions, which 
ought to have received the strongest and most effectual control, and 
whicli liave begot acts of retaliation, which, without proper preven- 
tions, may have an extent equally calamitous and dishonorable to 
both partiis, lliouijh, as it should seem, more extensively pernicious 
to the natives and settlers of this country. 

How much soever, Sir, we may dilVtr in oilier respects, upon tliis 
one i>oint we must perfectly concur, being alike interested to i)re- 
scrve the name of Knglishmen from reproach, and individuals from 
experiencing such unnecessary evils, as can have no eflect upon a 
general decision. Every proper measure, which may tend to pre- 
vent these criminal excesses in individuals, I shall ever be ready to 
embrace ; and, as an advance on my part, I have, as the first act of 
my counnand, enlarged Mr. Livingston,' and have written to his 
father upon the subject of such excesses as have passed in New 
Jersey, desiring his concurrence in such measures as, even under 
the conditions of war, the common interests of humanity require. 

I am further to acquaint you. Sir, that it wa.s my intention to 
have sent this day a similar letter of compliment to Congress, but 
am informed it is previously necessary to obtain a passport from 
your Excellency, which I therefore hope to receive, if you have no 
objection, tor the passage of iMr. Morgaim to Philadelplna for the 
above purpose. I have the honor to be, &-c. 

Guv Caiileton. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Head-Quarlers, New York, 20 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of tlie lOth of 
Junet with two enclosures, containing the report of Chief Justice 
Brearley concerning the capture and detention of Hatfield and 
Badgely in New Jersey, and extracts of letters from your Excel- 
lency to Licutenant-Gcneral Robert.son, and from Governor Liv- 
ingston to you. 

Before I received your letter, I had written to Governor Liv- 
ingston concerning the detention of these men, as also of two 
others, who I am informed are lately condemned in New Jersey, 
upon some new provincial law of high treason, to suffer death, and 
even the day of their execution appointed. To this letter I have as yet received no answer; but I trust it will be admitted, that 
executions upon this ground, whether with or without the tbruiali- 
ties of law, are measures of the most fatal extremity. In a civil 
war between people of one empire, there can, during the contest, 
be no treason at all ; or each party, assuming the other to be trai- 
tors, shall be able, by the same or different laws, some made even 
during the very contest, to elTect more carnage than by the sword, 
producing the most horrid refinements in ill, under the disguise 
of law ; and one law no doubt is or can be made as sharp as an- 
other, and chief justices may be found on both sides equally san- 
guinary. " Those men," says the chief justice of Jersey in the re- 
port enclosed by your Excellency, " who were charged with high 
treason, I committed to prison ; of this description were the said 
Hatfield and Badgely, who had joined the enemy long since the 
passing of the treason act, and whose persons by the law of nations 
are not protected by flags of truce." What shall be said. Sir, 
when a man of learning, as by profession this gentleman ought to 
be, can go this length ? Shall those who oppose the separation of 
the whole empire become traitors to a part, and be condemned by 
new laws, even during the contest, for their attachment to the old ? 
And shall the plea of sincerity and conscience, which is the vin- 
dication of some, be yet of no avail ? I have at present a purpose 
of establishing a court of criminal law in this town, for reasons 
which certain difficult questions have lately pressed upon me, and 
not, your Excellency may be assured, as an instrument of civil 
war. Yet it is manifest, that, if I were capable of making re- 
taliations in legal form, either retaliations must beget each other 
without end, to the disgrace of humanity, or the local laws of par- 
tial treason, lately passed in the Provinces, must be done away. 

But I think it impossible we should be of different minds on 
this subject. There must be some mistake in the way, which I do 
not understand. To prevent delay, and the imperfections of this 
sort of explanation. General Robertson, to whom I have commu- 
nicated your letters, has voluntarily offered personally to wait on 
your Excellency, and endeavour to place these questions, for the 
future, on ground of some mutual good understanding. I am there- 
fore to desire your Excellency's passports, for this purpose, for 
Lieutenant-General Robertson, an aid-de-camp, and George D. Lud- 
low, Esquire, either to wait on your Excellency, or to meet other 
persons empowered, at any place you may be pleased to appoint. 

I am, Sir, &c.

Aj-1-i.Nuix.j SIR GUY CARLKTOiN. 639 

New York, 7 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

However convinced of your Excellency's disposition, yet it gave 
nie imich satisfaction to be contirmcd therein by your letter of the 
thJd of June, wherein you say, that it would make you happy if 
any measures can be adopted for luunani/inir as much as possible 
the calamities attendant on a state of war. But yon are also 
pleased to say, resort must be had to the civil power, the laws 
roniplainod of having been passed without your agency, and not 
being under your control. I foci the fidl force of this argument, 
and shall be content to take any means, which can procure the 
desired end. I must ob.serve, however, that, as these laws are con- 
sidered by me, and in fact are, mere instruments of war, so I think, 
Sir, that on occasion of any conference with the civil power on 
this subject, it will be nece.«sary (as the army is so deeply engaged 
in the question), that you should at least have some confidential 
officer to assist in the attainment of a purpose, which I am per- 
suaded we both with C(iual earnestness desire, nor can I appre- 
hend any difficulty in the attainment. 

There are questions, which require only that they should be pro- 
posed to men of sound judgment and di.'^passionate tninds, that they 
may be assented to. The difficulties with mc. Sir, arc as to the 
mode ; and I sec no reason why I should not frankly call upon you 
for assistance. Am I, Sir, to apply to Congress, that persons ap- 
pointed by me may be admitted to conferences nt Philadolpliia ? 
Or can any deputation be sent by Congress to your camp for this 
purpose, to be there met by persons empowered by me ? Or will 
you. Sir, undertake to manage our common interest ? All I wish 
for is, that an end, in which our common honor and humanity are 
engaged, may be substantially obtained. 

I shall take this opportunity to inform your Excellency, that 1 
have learned within these few days, that clergymen, physicians, 
surgeons, and apothecaries, have been considered as prisoners of 
war, and paroled accordingly. This I am sure requires only the 
bare mention of it to be reformed. These paroles, if your Excel- 
lency concurs, may in public orders be discharged, and in future 
forbid as erroneous and contrary to the customs of war. 

I am further to inform you, Sir, that the court-martial upon 
Lippcncot for the murder of Huddy has given in its judgment, and 
the minutes of the trial, which ere long I shall order to be copied 
and sent to your Excellency accompanied by some other documents. 

I have ju.st learned from a letter written by your commissary- 



540 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

general of prisoners, that your objection to an exchange of land 
for naval prisoners is, that it would give us a great and permanent 
strength for which you could receive no adequate compensation. 
To remove this objection, I propose, that (all exchanges of men 
of the same description being exhausted) sailor and soldier shall be 
immediately exchanged, and the soldier so received by us shall not 
serve in nor against the thirteen Provinces for one year, a period 
which I trust will extend beyond our present contentions. This I 
think throws the advantage entirely into your hands ; but I do not 
think this inequality of importance enough to weigh against the 
imprisonment of so many men on both sides ; for imprisonment 
itself, attended with its necessary conditions, is, in this season es- 
pecially, a calamity which ought not to be imposed or protracted 
for political niceties. I am, &c.

New York, 2 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

The pacific disposition of the Parliament and people of England 
towards the thirteen Provinces has already been communicated to 
you, and the resolutions of the House of Commons of the 27th of 
February last have been placed in your Excellency's hands, and 
intimations given at the same time, that further pacific measures 
were likely to follow. Since which, until the present time, we have 
had no direct communications from England ; but a mail is now 
arrived, which brings us very important information. 

We are acquainted, Sir, by authority, that negotiations for a gen- 
eral peace have already commenced at Paris, and that Mr. Gren- 
ville is invested with full powers to treat with all parties at war, 
and is now at Paris in the execution of his commission. And we 
are likewise, Sir, further made acquainted, that his Majesty, in order 
to remove all obstacles to that peace, which he so ardently wishes 
to restore, has commanded his ministers to direct Mr. Grenville, 
that the independency of the thirteen Provinces should be pro- 
posed by him in the first instance, instead of making it a condition 
of a general treaty ; however, not without the highest confidence, 
that the Loyalists shall be restored to their possessions, or a full 
compensation made to them for whatever confiscations may have 
taken place. 

With respect to Mr. Laurens, we are to acquaint you, that he has 
been enlarged and discharged from all engagements without any 
conditions whatever; after which he declared of his own accord, 
that he considered Lord Cornwallis as freed from his parole. Upon

of Congress. 

We are further acquainted, that trans[X)rts liave been prepared 
in Kiitrland for conveyiui; all the American ])risoners to this coun- 
try, to be exchanged here ; and wo are directed to urge by every 
consideration of humanity the most speedy exchaiii;c, a measure in 
which not only the comforts but the rights of individuals are con- 
cerned. To obtain this end, a proposition has already been made, 
that (all exchanges of men of the same description being exhaust- 
ed) sailor and soldier should be immediately exchanged, man for 
man against each other, with this condition annexed, that your 
sailors should be at liberty to serve the moment they were ex- 
changed, and that the soldiers so received by us should not serve 
in nor against the thirteen Provinces for one year. And from this 
proposition, however unequal the conditions, we do not now wish 
to recede. We have the honor to be, &c.

new York, 25 October, 17d2. 

Sir, 

I am much at a loss how to answer the declarations of Congress 
communicated to me by your Excellency's letter of tiie •2d instant, 
nor do I fully comprehend their import. I understand, that the 
practice has been for nations at war to provide at the conclusion 
of a peace for the liquidation of all demands, made reciprocally for 
the maintenance of prisoners ; at which time the whole has either 
been compendiously settled, or further time given to collect an ac- 
count of expenses of maintenance from all parts where they have 
been incurred ; but we. Sir, on our part can have no objection 
to appoint commissaries at this period for the purpose of liquida- 
tion, if Congre.Hs earnestly desire that such liquidation shall be so 
prematurely made, but it has not been usual I think since the bar- 
barous ages to use any menaces, however obscure, towards prison- 
ers, and still less to practise towards them any barbarity. 

There is an ea.sy and honorable way for Congress to diminish 
the burthen, which our prisoners occasion. Let those, who, agree- 
ably to the terms of their surrender, should have been restored to 
their country five years ago, be now delivered up; let a number 
of our prisoners, equal to those we have liberated, be returned un- 
der the condition, that where soldiers are given for seamen, those 
soldiers are not to serve in or against the thirteen Provinces for 
twelve months, as has been formerly proposed ; let the remainder be given up for an equitable ransom, as is practised by all civilized people. 

While on our side so strong a desire of peace is manifested, 
your prisoners liberally and in confidence returned to their Prov- 
inces, I cannot but lament to find such indications as make me 
apprehend Congress is determined, not only to reject all peace, but 
to bring the war to the last extremities of rage, and, as far as in 
them lies, to transmit it down to posterity with all its horrors. 
Their refusing to release our prisoners for those we have sent in is 
in the nature of an injunction upon us not in future to release 
any more ; so that, in passing sentence on British prisoners, Con- 
gress should recollect, that it is passing the like sentence on those 
of America, who are or may fall into our hands, unless indeed it 
shall in the event be found, that the American prisoners may ex- 
perience the greatest share of tenderness and regard from those 
they call their enemies. I am, Sir, &,c.

New York, G April, J783. 

Sir, 

A packet from England arrived in this port last night, by which 
I have despatches from Mr. Townshend, one of his Majesty's prin- 
cipal Secretaries of State, communicating official intelligence, that 
preliminary articles of peace with France and Spain were signed 
at Paris on the 20th of January last, and that the ratifications have 
been since exchanged at the same place. 

The King, Sir, has been pleased in consequence of these events, 
to order proclamations to be published, declaring a cessation of 
arms, as well by sea as land ; and his Majesty's pleasure signified, 
that I .should cause the same to be published in all places under 
my command, in order that his Majesty's subjects may pay imme- 
diate and due obedience thereto ; and such proclamation I shall 
accordingly cause to be made on Tuesday next, the 8th instant. 
In consequence thereof, and in conformity to the articles of peace, 
all our prisoners of war are to be set at liberty and restored with 
all convenient despatch, entertaining no doubt that similar meas- 
ures will be taken on the part of the United States of America. 
In like manner no doubt can be entertained, that Congress, in con- 
formity to the fifth article of the provisional treaty, will lose no 
time in earnestly recommending to the legislatures of the respective 
States to provide for the restitution of confiscated estates, and to 
reconsider and revise all laws of confiscation, that they may be ren-

shall be ready and earnest to cultivate that spirit of perfect good

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

New York, 12 May, 1763. 

Sir, 

I can have no objection to the giving of your Excellency, in 
writing, full information of the measures taken for the evacuation 
of this place, nor should I have had any to the noting of the 
whole of our conversation and preserving it in minutes. Mistakes 
or misconstruction might thereby be prevented. 

Very soon after the orders for a cessation of ho.stilitics were re- 
ceived here, letters were written both to Europe and the West In- 
dies, to require that all the shij)ping, which could be procured, 
micht be sent to assist in the evacuation of this place. About the 
same time all the prisoners of war in our hands were released. 

An embarkation was in much forwardness previous to the official 
information of peace. Soon after, I wrote to the minister of for- 
eign affairs to request, that Congress would be pleased to empower 
any person or persons in behalf of the United States to be pres- 
ent at New York, and to assist such persons as should be ap- 
pointed by me to inspect and superintend all embarkations, which 
the evacuation of this place might require; and that they would 
represent to me every infraction of the letter or spirit of the treaty, 
that redress might be immediately ordered. In the mean time, to 
prevent abuse or delay, and until I could learn the determination 
of Congress, I requested of Daniel Parker, Esquire, one of the 
contractors for supplying your army with provisions, and of Ma- 
jor Hopkins, late deputy commissary of prisoners, that they would 
undertake the business with other persons whom I appointed, which 
thcv did accordingly, and executed with much diligence. 



544 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Afpe.ndix. 

This fleet sailed about the 27th of April, for different parts of 
Nova Scotia, and, including the troops, carried about seven thousand 
persons with all their effects ; also some artillery and public stores ; 
so that you will perceive the evacuation began sooner, and was in 
greater forwardness, than could have been expected. Your Excel- 
lency will also perceive, from what I have said, that at present it 
is impossible to tell when the evacuation of this city can be com- 
pleted. In truth, I cannot guess the quantity of shipping that will 
be sent to me, nor the number of persons that will be forced to 
abandon this place. The evacuation of Penobscot will require 
considerably less tonnage, and I should think may soon be ef- 
fected. If it is most eligible to you that I should give a prefer- 
ence to this object, I shall immediately give orders for its being 
carried into most speedy execution. 

I enclose a copy of an order, which I have given out to pre- 
vent the carrying away any negroes or other property of the Amer- 
can inhabitants. I understand from the gentlemen therein named, 
that they visited the fleet bound to Nova Scotia, and ordered on 
shore whatever came clearly under the above description. There 
apjioarcd to be but little difference of opinion, except in the case 
of negroes who had been declared free previous to my arrival. 
As I have no right to deprive them of that liberty I found them 
possessed of, an accurate register was taken of every circumstance 
respecting them, so as to serve as a record of the name of the 
original proprietor of the negro, and as a rule by which to judge 
of his value. By this open method of conducting the business, I 
hoped to prevent all fraud, and whatever might admit of different 
constructions is left open for future explanation or compensation. 
Had these negroes been denied permission to embark, they would, 
in spite of every means to prevent it, have found various methods 
of quitting this place, so that the former owner would no longer 
have been able to trace them, and of course would have lost, in 
every way, all chance of compensation. 

The business carried on in this public manner, and the orders 
nominating persons to superintend embarkations published in the 
gazette, I had no reason to think either the embarkation, or any 
circumstances attending it, could have been matter of surprise to 
your Excellency on the Cth of May. I then however learned with 
concern, that the embarkation, which had already taken place, and 
in which a large number of negroes had been conveyed away, ap- 
peared to your E.xcellency as a measure totally different from the 
letter and spirit of the treaty. 



Appendix.] SIR GUY CARLET(3N. •'i45 

The negroes in question, I have already said, I tbuiid free wlirn 
I arrived at New York. 1 had therefore no riglit, as I ihoujrlit, 
to prevent their going away to any part of the world tliey thought 
proper. 

1 must confess, that the mere supposition that the King's minister 
could deliberately stipulate in a treaty an engagement to be guilty 
of a notorious breach of the public faith, towards people of any 
comple.\ion, seems to denote a less Iriendly disposition than I could 
wish, and I think less friendly than we might expect. After all, I 
only give my own opinion. Every negro's name is registered, and 
the master he formerly belonged to, with such other circumstances 
as si-rvod to denote hi.s value, that it may be adjusted by compen- 
sation, if that was really the intention and meaning of the treaty. 
Restoration, where inseparable from a breach of public faith, is, as 
all the world I think must allow, utterly impracticable. I know 
of no better method of preventing abuse, and the carrying away 
of negroes or other American property, than that I proposed to the 
minister of foreign affairs in my letter of the 1-lth of April, the 
naming of commissioners to assist those appointed by mc to inspect 
all embarkations ; and I am pleased to fiii<l your Excellency has 
approved of this method, and appointed Egbert Benson, Esquire, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, and Daniel Parker, Esquire, one of the 
contractors for supplying your army with provisions, commissioners 
on your part for this purpose. I am. Sir, &,c.

the winds have lately been very unfavorable, if I have proper as-

Ship-yard and Hallet's Wharf in New York, and the Brewery and 
Bake-house on Long Island, (which the admiral represents as in-

as wind and weather may permit ; only retaining (in addition to the 
reservations above specified) Staten Island, with Dennis's, New

LETTER FROM COUNT DE VERGENNES TO GENERAL WASHLNGTON, RESPECTING CAPTAIN ASGILL. 

Versailles, 20 July, 1782. 

Snt, 

It is not in quality of a King, the friend and ally of the United 
States, (though with the knowledge and consent of his Majesty) 
that I now have the honor to write to your Excellency. It is as 
a man nf sonsibilitv and a tender father, who feels all the force of 
paternal love, that I take the liberty to address to your Excellency 
my earnest solicitations in favor of a mother and family in tears. 
Her situation seems the more worthy of notice on our part, as it is 
to the humanity of a nation at war with her own, that she has re- 
course, for what she ought to receive from the impartial justice 
of her own generals. 

I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency a copy of a letter, 
which Lady Asgill has just written me. I am not known to her, 
nor was I acquainted that her son was the unhappy victim, destined 
by lot to expiate the odious crime that a formal denial of justice 
obliges you to avenge. Your Excellency will not read this letter 
without being extremely affected ; it had that effect upon the King 
and Queen, to whom I communicated it. The goodness of their 
Majesties' hearts induces them to desire, that the inquietudes of 
an unfortunate mother may be cahned, and her tenderness reas- 
sured. I felt. Sir, that there are cases where humanity itself ex- 
acts the most extreme rigor ; perhaps the one now in question may 
be of the number; but, allowing reprisals to be just, it is not less 
horrid to those who are the victuns ; and the character of your 
Excellency is too well known, for me not to be persuaded that you 
desire nothing more than to be able to avoid the disagreeable ne- 
cessity. 

There is one consideration, Sir, which, though it is not decisive, 
may have an influence on your resolution. Captain Asgill is 
doubtless your prisoner, but he is among those whom the arms of 
the King contributed to put into your hands at Yorktown. Al- 
though this circumstance does not operate as a safeguard, it how- 
ever justifies the interest I permit myself to take in this affair. 
If it is in your power. Sir, to consider and have regard to it, you 
will do what is agreeable to their Majesties ; the danger of young 
Asgill, the tears, the despair of his mother, affect thom sensibly ; 
and they will see with pleasure the hope of consolation shine out 
for those unfortunate people. 

In seeking to deliver Mr. Asgill from the fate which threatens 
him, I am far from engaging you to secure another victim ; the par- 
don, to be perfectly satisfactory, must be entire. I do not imagine 
it can be productive of any bad consequences. If the English 
general has not been able to punish the horrible crime you com- 
plain of, in so exemplary a manner as he should, there is reason 
to think he will take the most efficacious measures to prevent the 
like in future. 

I sincerely wish. Sir, that my intercession may meet success ; 
the sentiment which dictates it, and which you have not ceased to 
manifest on every occasion, assures me, that you will not be in- 
different to the prayers and to the tears of a family, which has 
recourse to your clemency through me. It is rendering homage 
to your virtue to implore it. 

I have the honor to be, with the most perfect consideration. 
Sir, yours, &,c. 

Vergennes.

NKWBURG ADDRESSES. 

Artor the army had marched from their encampment at Ver- 
plaiick's Point, and gone into wintcr-<iuarlers at Newburg, they 
had leisure to reflect upon tiieir situation and prospects. The an- 
ticipation of a speedy peace, and tiie long arrearages of their pay, 
while their claims were unadjusted, their accounts unsettled, and 
no erticient security was provided for a future liquidation of them, 
were causes of nuich excitement and unensiness. In the month of 
December they came to a serious determination to address Congress 
on the subject of their grievances. A memorial was accordingly 
drawn up, which was agreed to by the principal officers, and was 
understood to express the sense of the army. A committee was 
appointed to carry this memorial to Pliihidelphia, and lay it before 
Congress, with such verbal representations to the several members 
as would fully explain its import, and the condition, feelings, and 
expectations of the army. This committee consisted of General 
WcDougall, Colonel Ogden, and Colonel Brooks. They proceeded 
to Philadelphia, and a few days after their arrival Congress passed 
the following resolutions, on the 25th of January, 17S3. 

" The grand counnitlee, consisting of a member from each St.ate, 
report, that they have considered the contents of a memorial pre- 
sented by the army, and find that they comprehend five dillerenl 
articles ; 

" 1. Present pay. 

" 2. A settlement of accounts of the arrearages of pay, and se- 
curity for what is due. 

"3. A commutation of the half-pay allowed by diflerent resolu- 
tions of Congress for an equivalent in gross. 

"4. A settlement of the accounts of deficiencies of rations and 
compensation. 

" 5. A settlement of the accounts of deficiencies of clothing and 
compensation. 

" Whereupon, Resolved, as to the first, that the superintendent 
of finance be directed, conformably to the measures already taken 
for that purpose, as soon as the state of the public finances will 
permit, to make such payment and in such manner as he shall think 
proper, till the further order of Congress. 

" Resolved, With respect to the second article, so far as relates 



552 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appeotix. 

to the settlement of accounts, that the several States be called upon 
to complete without delay the settlements with their respective lines 
of the army, up to the 1st day of August, 1783, and that the su- 
perintendent of finance be directed to take such measures as shall 
appear to him most proper for effecting the settlement from that 
period. 

" As to what relates to the providing security for what shall be 
found due on such settlement ; 

" Resolved, That the troops of the United States, in common 
with all creditors of the same, have an undoubted right to expect 
such security ; and that Congress will make every effort in tlieir 
power to obtain, from the respective States, substantial funds, ade- 
quate to the object of funding the whole debt of the United States, 
and will enter upon an immediate and full consideration of the na- 
ture of such funds, and the most likely mode of obtaining them. 

" Ordered, That the remainder of the report be referred to a 
committee of five." 

General Knox had been appointed on the part of the army to 
correspond with the committee respecting the objects of their com- 
mission, and he received from them the following report. 

" Philadelphia, 8 February, 1783 

" Dear Sir, 

" The army has, no doubt, been anxious to hear from us, and 
we should have had as much pleasure in communicating to them 
any success of our application for them, as they in receiving it; 
but nothing of any moment has yet been decided for them. We 
spent the first week after our arrival in conversing witli the mem- 
bers of Congress on the subject of the address, to prepare them 
for the reception of it before it was read, lest the want of informa- 
tion should retard a favorable resolution on it. On its being read, 
a committee was appointed to confer with us, consisting of a mem- 
ber from each State but Georgia, which was unrepresented, and 
had no member attending. The financier attended at this meeting. 
To this committee we communicated the condition of the army, 
and we dilated very diffusely on all the subjects stated in the address ; 
indeed, truth and decency were the only bounds observed in our 
conference with them. The reason of our applying to Congress to 
determine on a compensation for half-pay was also minutely detailed. 

" The result as to present pay will be communicated to you by 
Colonel Brooks. On this subject we can only commit to paper, 
that a month's pay in notes to the officers, and one to the non- 
commissioned and privates, as weekly payments of half a dollar

|K.T wi'ik 10 lilt' latter t* nil that can be now obtained. This grand 
coniMiitti'f appointed a sulvcoinrniltee to coiivor.-te with us, as occa- 
sion should require, if any new matter occurred to us; nud to in- 
spect critically into the principles of annuities, in order U) deter- 
mine on an etpiivalent for the hall-pay. 

" In about ten days they re|)ortcd to the grand connnittcc, that 
twelve years was a mean life of the ages of the olliccrs of the ar- 
my, and that six whole years' pay was equal, to the country and 
the army, to llie half-pay for life. The committee then re|M)rted to 
Congress, which produced the resolutions which have been trans- 
mitted to the Commander-in-chief That part of the report, which 
respected the value of the half-pay, was recommitted to a smaller 
committee, the number of years being considered tfx) many. 

" This committee took up some time to examine calculations on 
annuities, and two days ago they reported five years' whole pay as 
equal to the half-pay for life ; but nine States would not approve the 
re|X)rt, Georgia, .Maryland, and Delaware unrepresented. We ad- 
vised our friends not to press lor a determination, if they could not 
carry the question ; as the sense of Maryland and Delaware were 
known to be favorable to us, and their delegates were daily ex- 
pected in town. On discussion in Congress, some of the members 
opposed to the commutation, and equidly so to half-pay, expressed 
a desire to put off the question, to give them time for more con- 
sideration ; it was accordingly granted. Thus stands the matter 
of commutation. 

" iMussachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and 
South Carolina were for the equivalent ; New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, and Jersey were against it. There is some 
prospect of getting one more of these States to vote for the coni- 
inutation. If this is accomplished, with Maryland and Delaware, 
the question will be carried ; whenever it is, as the report now 
stands, it will be at the election of a line, as such, to accept of the 
commutation or retain their claim to the half-pay. Congress beinf 
determined, that no alteration shall take place in the emolument 
held out to the army but by their consent. 

" This rendered it unnecessary for us to consult the army on the 
equivalent for the half-pay. The zeal of a great number of mem- 
bers of Congress to get Continental funds, while a few wished to 
have us referred to the States, induced us to conceal what funds 
we wished, or expected, lest our declaration for one or the other 
might retard a settlement of our accounts, or a determination on 
the equivalent for half-pay. Indeed, some of our best friends in

554 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix.' 

Congress declared, however desirous tliey were to have our accounts 
settled, and the commutation fixed, as well as to get funds, yet 
they would oppose referring us to the States for a settlement and 
security, till all prospect of obtaining Continental funds was at an 
end. 

" Whether this is near or not, as commutation for the half-pay 
was one of the principal objects of the address, the obtaining of 
that is necessary, previous to our particularizing what fund will be 
most agreeable to us ; this must be determined by circumstances. 
If Congress get funds we shall be secured. If not, the equivalent 
settled, a principle will be established, which will be more ac- 
ceptable to the eastern States than half-pay, if application must be 
made to them. As it is not likely that Congress will be able to 
determine soon on the commutation (for the reasons above-men- 
tioned), it is judged necessary that Colonel Brooks return to the 
army, to give them a more particular detail of our prospects than 
can be done in the compass of a letter. It is however thought 
proper, that General Mi-'Dougall should remain in Philadelphia, to 
endeavour at a proper time to bring on the determination of Con- 
gress on the important question, as well as to quicken the accom- 
plishment of the other points contained in the address. In the 
mean time Colonel Ogden visits his family, as well as to do some 
business which will greatly promote the object of our being sent 
here. Colonel Ogden will, however, return, if it should be judged 
necessary. We conceive it expedient to make the army this gen- 
eral report, and beg leave to refer you to Colonel Brooks for a 
more particular one. 

" We are. Sir, with great truth, your affectionate humble servants.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

" Philadelphia, 23 February, 1797. 
" Sir, 

" Believing that there may be times and occasions, on which 
my opinion of the anonymous letters and their author, as delivered 
to the army in the year 1783, may be turned to some personal 
and malignant purpose, I do hereby declare, that I did not, at the 
time of writing my address, regard you as the author of the said 
letters; and further, that I have since had sufficient reason for be- 
lieving, that the object of the author was just, honorable, and 
friendly to the country, though the means suggested by him were 
certainly liable to much misunderstanding and abuse. 

"I am, Sir, with great regard, your most obedient servant,

UUDKRS ISSUED BY GENERAL WASHINGTON TO Till; ARMY, ANNOUNCING THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES. 

Head-Quarters, Id April, 1783. 

Till' Commander-in-chief orders the cessation of hostilities, l)e- 
tvveen the United States of .\mericn and the Kinij of (ireat Britain, 
to be publicly proclaimed to-morrow at twelve at the New Building; 
and that the proclamation, which will be communicated herewith, 
be read to-morrow evening at the head of every regiment and 
corps of the army ; after which the chaplains with the several 
brigades will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies, 
particularly for his overruling the wrath of man to his own glory, 
and causing the rage of war to cease among the nations. 

Although the proclamation before alluded to extends oidy to the 
prohibition of hostilities, and not to the annunciation of a general 
peace, yet it must afford the most rational and sincere satisfaction 
to every benevolent mind, as it |)uts a period to a long and doubt- 
ful contest, stops the cllusion of human blood, opens the prospect 
to a more splendid scene, and, like another morning star, promises 
the approach of a brighter day than has hitherto illuminated the 
western hemisphere. On such a happy day, which is the harbinger 
of peace, a day which completes the eighth year of the war, it 
would l)c ingratitude not to rejoice ; it would be insensibility not 
to participate in the general felicity. 

The Commander-in-chief, far from endeavouring to stifle the 
feelings of joy in his own bosom, offers his most cordial congratu- 
lations on the occasion to all the odicers of every denomination, 
to all the troops of the United States in general, and in particular 
to those gallant and persevering men, who had resolved to defend 
the rights of their invaded country so long as the war should con- 
tinue. For these are the men, who ought to be considered as the 
pride and boast of the American army ; and who, crowned with 
well-earned laurels, may soon withdraw from tiie field of glory to 
the more tranquil walks of civil life. 

While the General recollects the almost infinite variety of scenes 
through which we have passed, with a mixture of pleasure, aston- 
ishment, and gratitude ; while he contemplates the prospect before 
us with rapture, he cannot help wishing that all the brave men 
(of whatever condition they may be), who have shared in the toils 



568 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

and dangers of effecting this glorious revolution, of rescuing mil- 
lions from the hand of oppression, and of laying the foundation of 
a great empire, might be impressed with a proper idea of the dig- 
nified part they have been called to act (under the smiles of Provi- 
dence) on the stage of human affairs. For happy, thrice happy, 
shall they be pronounced hereafter, who have contributed any 
thing, who have performed the meanest office, in erecting this stu- 
pendous fabric of freedom and e/iipire on the broad basis of inde- 
pendency ; who have assisted in protecting the rights of human 
nature, and establishing an asylum for the poor and oppressed of 
all nations and religions. 

The glorious task for which we first flew to arms being thus ac- 
complished ; the liberties of our country being fully acknowledged 
and firmly secured by the smiles of Heaven on the purity of our 
cause, and the honest exertions of a feeble people determined to 
be free, against a powerful nation disposed to oppress them ; and 
the character of those, who have persevered through every extremity 
of hardship, suffering, and danger, being immortalized by the illus- 
trious appellation of the patriot army, nothing now remains but for 
the actors of this mighty scene to preserve a perfect unvarying con- 
sistency of character through the very last act, to close the drama 
with applause, and to retire from the military theatre with the same 
approbation of angels and men, which has crowned all their former 
virtuous actions. For this purpose no disorder or licentiousness 
must be tolerated. Every considerate and well-disposed soldier 
must remember, it will be absolutely necessary to wait with pa- 
tience until peace shall be declared, or Congress shall be enabled 
to take proper measures for the security of the public stores. As 
soon as these arrangements shall be made, the General is confi- 
dent there will be no delay in discharging, with every mark of dis- 
tinction and honor, all the men enlisted for the war, who will then 
have faithfully performed their engagements with the public. The 
General has already interested himself in their behalf, and he 
thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his disposition to be 
useful to them on the present and every other proper occasion. In 
the mean time, he is determined that no military neglects or ex- 
cesses shall go unpunished while he retains the command of the 
army.

ORDKR OF TflE PUBLIC AUDIENCK OF GKNKIIAL VVASJIING- 
TON IN CO.NGRESS. AND THE i'llKSIDENTS ANSWER TO 
lUS AOUHESS ON RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION. 

A committee, consisting of Mr. Jeflerson, Mr. Gerry, and Mr. 
McHenry, was appointed by Congress to make suital)lo arrange- 
ments for the last public audience of General VVa.sliiiigton. In 
conformity with their report it was resolved, on the SSd of De- 
cember, that the ceremony should be conducted as follows. 

" 1. The President and members are to be seated and cov- 
ered, and the Secretary to be standin;; by the side of the President. 

" 2. The arrival of the General is to be announced by the mes- 
senger to the Secretary, who is thereupon to introduce the Gen- 
eral, attended by his aids, into the Ilall of Congress. 

" 3. The General, being conducted to a chair by the Secretary, 
is to be seated, with an aid on each side standing, and the Sec 
retary is to resume his place. 

" 4. After a proper time for the arrnngomcnt of spectators, si- 
lence is to be ordered by the Surretary if neces.sary, and the Presi- 
dent is to address the General in the following words. ' Sir ; The 
United States in Congress assembled are prepared to receive your 
communications.' Whereupon the General is to arise and address 
Congress ; after which he is to deliver his commission and a copy 
of his address to the President. 

" 5. The General having resumed his pl.icc, the President is 
to deliver the answer of Congress, which the General is to receive 
standing. 

" 6. The President having finished, the Secretary is to deliver 
the General a copy of the answer, and the General is then to take 
his leave. When the General rises to make his address, and also 
when he retires, he is to bow to Congress, which they are to re- 
turn by uncovering without bowing." 

According to this order General Washington was introduced to 
Congress, and pronounced his address. He then advanced and 
delivered to the President his commission and a copy of his ad- 
dress, and having resumed his place, the President returned (ho 
following answer.

570 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Appendix. 

"Sir, 

" The United States, in Congress assembled, receive with emo- 
tions too affecting fur utterance, the solemn resignation of the au- 
thorities under which you have led their troops with success through 
a perilous and a doubtful war. Called upon by your country to 
defend its invaded rights, you accepted the sacred charge, before 
it had formed alliances, and whilst it was without funds or a gov- 
ernment to support you. You have conducted the great military 
contest with wisdom and fortitude, invariably regarding the rights 
of the civil power through all disasters and changes. You have, 
by the love and confidence cf your fellow citizens, enabled them to 
display their martial genius, and transmit their fame to posterity. 
You have persevered, till these United States, aided by a magnani- 
mous King and nation, have been enabled under a just Providence 
to close the war in freedom, safety, and independence ; on which 
happy event we sincerely join you in congratulations. 

" Having defended the standard of liberty in this new world, hav- 
ing taught a lesson useful to those who inflict, and to those who 
feel oppression, you retire from the great theatre of action with the 
blessings of your fellow citizens ; but the glory of your virtues will 
not terminate with your military command, it will continue to ani- 
mate remotest ages. 

" We feel with you our obligations to the army in general, and 
will particularly charge ourselves with the interests of those con- 
fidential officers, who have attended your person to this affecting 
moment. 

" We join you in commending the interests of our dearest country 
to the protection of Almighty God, beseeching him to dispose the 
hearts and minds of its citizens to improve the opportunity af- 
forded them of becoming a happy and respectable nation. And for 
you we address to him our earnest prayers, that a life so beloved 
may be fostered with all his care, that your days may be liappy as 
they have been illustrious, and that he will finally give you that 
reward, which this world cannot give."
