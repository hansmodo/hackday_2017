COMPRISING 



OFFICIAL LETTERS 

RELATING TO THE FRENCH WAR 



AND 



PRIVATE LETTERS 

BEFORE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 



INTRODUCTION 



TO THE FIRST PART. 



IN the method, which has been adopted for the pres- 
ent publication, the First Part consists of letters and pa- 
pers written before the American Revolution. They 
relate chiefly to the French War, in which Washington 
was actively engaged for five years. During a large 
portion of that time he was commander-in-chief of the 
Virginia forces, and his correspondence in that capacity, 
both as furnishing historical materials and manifesting 
the characteristics and resources of his own mind, is 
curious and valuable. The importance attached to this 
correspondence by himself may be understood from the 
fact, that, many years after the letters were written, he 
revised the first drafts, and caused them to be carefully 
recorded in volumes. They have been preserved in 
this condition. Several of the originals still exist in his 
own handwriting. The same letter-books also contain 
military orders and reports of courts-martial, with con- 
necting and explanatory remarks, which appear to have 
been added at a later date. These records form a com- 
plete narrative of the events in which Washington was 
concerned, from the time he joined General Braddock 
till he retired from the army.

X INTRODUCTION. [PART I. 

At Braddock's defeat, Washington, in common with 
the commander-in-chief and the other officers, lost all 
his papers, which were taken by the French, sent first 
to Canada, and thence to France. Among these were 
contained his official correspondence of the preceding 
year, and a private journal of the campaign, important 
as developing the particulars of his military movements, 
of the death of Jumonville, and of the affair at the Great 
Meadows. Fortunately this loss has been in a good 
measure repaired from other sources. By the courtesy 
and favor of the British Ministry, I was allowed free ac- 
cess to the archives of the public offices in London, 
where I found, particularly among the manuscripts in 
the office of the Board of Trade, several valuable docu- 
ments illustrative of these events. Through the polite- 
ness of Mr. Lockhart, I was also made acquainted with 
the existence of Governor Dinwiddie's letter-books, and 
a collection of Washington's early letters, in the posses- 
sion of Mr. Hamilton of London, who very obligingly 
permitted them to be copied for my use. The file of 
Washington's letters contained the originals written to 
Governor Dinwiddie, describing all his military transac- 
tions previous to Braddock's defeat, and of course filled 
up the chasm occasioned by the loss of his papers in that 
disastrous battle. 

In the library of the War Department at Paris I had, 
moreover, the good fortune to find some original papers 
respecting the operations of the French, on the frontiers 
of Virginia, during the time of Washington's first cam- 
paigns, copies of which were freely granted to me. 

Many particulars, in addition to these materials, have 
been derived from the military and other letters, official 
and private, which were received by Washington in the 
time of the war, and were preserved at Mount Vernon. 
These have served to shed much light upon his own 



PART!.] INTRODUCTION. XI 

writings, by contributing matter for brief notes, and 
more full explanations in the Appendix. For this ob- 
ject I have likewise consulted such other manuscript 
authorities as could be obtained, relating to the period 
in question, and the best printed records and docu- 
ments, such as the journals of assemblies, statutes at 
large, proclamations, governors' messages, and the cor- 
respondence of officers high in rank, both military and 
civil, English and French. It has in all cases been my 
endeavour to establish facts, as far as possible, by original 
testimony, and to take nothing at second hand where the 
means existed of ascending to a more authentic source. 
As this aim has been pursued with a scrupulous care 
and persevering diligence, it is believed, that as much 
accuracy has been attained, as the nature of such inqui- 
ries will admit, and that nothing has been passed over, 
which would serve to illustrate the character of Wash- 
ington, or explain the transactions in which he took an 
important part. 

After he resigned his commission in the army, and 
retired to his plantation at Mount Vernon, he devoted 
himself for fifteen years almost exclusively to his private 
affairs. He was usually a member of the Virginia House 
of Burgesses, but few traces remain of his public acts in 
that body. A list of the voters at his several elections, 
denoting the persons for whom they voted, has been 
preserved, from which it appears, that he was uniformly 
chosen by a large majority over all his competitors. 

Two manuscript volumes contain the copies of letters, 
which were written between the time of his leaving the 

o 

army and the beginning of the revolution. They are 
copied out with peculiar neatness in his own handwriting. 
As these letters were directed chiefly to his mercantile 
agents in London, employed to sell his tobacco and the 
other produce of his plantations, and to purchase such 



Xll INTRODUCTION. [PART I. 

articles as he wanted from that market, they have little 
in them of public or permanent interest. They show 
the exactness of method, the unceasing industry, the 
minuteness of detail, and rigid economy, with which he 
managed all his affairs, and prosecuted every kind of 
business he undertook. Political reflections, general 
remarks, and opinions on higher topics, are occasionally 
introduced, but these are incidental, few, and brief. 
From this part of the correspondence such selections 
have been made, as were suited to the objects of the 
pfersnt work. 

For many years previous to the revolution, it was 
Washington's custom to keep a diary of some of the 
principal incidents, that occurred within his observation. 
For this purpose he commonly used an almanac, inter- 
leaved with blank paper, and bound in a small volume. 
He made daily entrances under three heads, namely, 
first, " PVhere, how, or with whom, my time is spent; 99 
secondly, "Jlccount of the Weather; 99 thirdly, "Re- 
marks and Observations. 99 He was a careful observer 
of the weather, and almost every night recorded the 
aspect of the heavens during the preceding day, whether 
cloudy or fair, the direction of the winds, and tempera- 
ture. Whenever he left home he carried the interleaved 
almanac in his pocket, as also another little book, in 
which he entered daily the amount of money paid out 
by him, and the specific objects for which it was paid. 
This habit ceased during the revolution, but was renew- 
ed afterwards. The contents of his diary turned chiefly 
on agricultural operations and other business concerns. 
These volumes, kept for a series of years, afford some 
biographical materials not destitute of interest. 

It has been a task of some difficulty to determine 
what general principles should be adopted, in selecting 
the parts for publication from the whole body of papers 



PART!.] INTRODUCTION. X1U 

left by Washington. In the first place, the mass of man- 
uscripts, which extends to eighty volumes, consisting 
chiefly of letters, is so large as to preclude the idea ot 
publishing more than a comparatively small portion. 
Again, -from the nature of the correspondence, being 
mostly official, and many of the letters having been 
written to different persons on the same subject, there 
are necessarily frequent repetitions, and numerous par- 
ticulars constantly intervening, which, though essential 
at the time in the transactions to which they relate, 
have no longer any interest or moment. Of this 
description are the innumerable details incident to the 
subordinate arrangements of an army, such as supplies, 
provisions, clothing, camp equipage, arms, ammunition, 
and other points of minor consideration, which engaged 
the incessant care of the commander-in-chief, and 
entered largely into his correspondence even with Con- 
gress and the highest officers both civil and military. 
To print all the materials of this kind would not only be 
useless in itself, but would add so much to the size and 
expense of the work, as, at the same time to make it 
cumbersome and unattractive to readers, and raise its 
cost above the means of many individuals, who may 
wish to possess these personal records and authentic 
memorials of the acts, opinions, and character of the 
father of his country. 

Under these circumstances I have endeavoured to 
pursue such a course, as would the most effectually at- 
tain the object to be desired, in bringing these papers 
before the public ; namely, to exhibit the writings of 
Washington in a manner, that will render strict justice 
to the imperishable name of their author, and contribute 
the greatest advantage to his countrymen, both at the 
present time and in future ages. For this purpose I 
have laid down two rules, which I have labored to follow 

VOL. II. c

INTRODUCTION. 



[PART 1. 



with as much discrimination as possible ; first, to select 
such parts, as have a permanent value on account of the 
historical facts which they contain, whether in relation 
to actual events, or to the political designs and opera- 
tions in which Washington was a leading or conspicuous 
agent ; secondly, to comprise such other parts, as con- 
tain the views, opinions, counsels, and reflections of the 
writer on all kinds of topics, showing thereby the 
structure of his mind, its powers and resources, and the 
strong and varied points of his character. Upon this 
plan it has been my study to go carefully through the 
manuscripts, without regard to what has heretofore been 
made public, and gather from the whole, and combine 
into one body, the portions most important for their in- 
trinsic value and historical characteristics ; so that the 
work, in its complete form, may be a 'depository of all 
the Writings of Washington, which it is essential to pre- 
serve, either as illustrating his political and private 
life, or the history of his country during the long and 
brilliant period of his public career. 

According to this plan, when a letter throughout bears 
the features above described, it will be printed entire, as 
will in every case the addresses, speeches, messages, 
circulars, and other state papers, issued by him from 
time to time. But many of the letters, both in the 
public and private correspondence, for the reasons al- 
ready assigned, will necessarily be printed with omis- 
sions of unimportant passages, relating chiefly to topics 
or facts evanescent in their nature, and temporary in 
their design. Special care will be taken, nevertheless, 
in all such omissions, that the sense shall not be marred, 
nor the meaning of the writer in any manner perverted 
or obscured. Nor is this difficult, because the omitted 
passages usually treat upon separate and distinct sub- 
jects, and may be removed without injury to the re- 
maining portions of the letter. 






PART!.] INTRODUCTION. XV 

It ought to be premised here, that, in preparing the 
manuscripts for the press, I have been obliged some- 
times to use a latitude of discretion, rendered unavoida- 
ble by the mode in which the papers have been pre- 
served. They are uniformly copied into volumes, and 
this task appears to have been performed, except in the 
revolutionary correspondence, by incompetent or very 
careless transcribers. Gross blunders constantly occur, 
which not unfrequently destroy the sense, and which 
never could have existed in the original drafts. In these 
cases I have of course considered it a duty, appertain- 
ing to the function of a faithful editor, to hazard such 
corrections as the construction of the sentence manifest- 
ly warranted, or a cool judgment dictated. On some 
occasions the writer himself, through haste or inadver- 
tence, may have fallen into an awkward use of words, 
faults of grammar, or inaccuracies of style, and when 
such occur from this source, I have equally felt bound 
to correct them. It would be an act of unpardonable 
injustice to any author, after his death, to bring forth 
compositions, and particularly letters, written with no 
design to their publication, and commit them to the press 
without previously subjecting them to a careful revision. 
This exercise of an editor's duty, however, I have 
thought it allowable to extend only to verbal and gram- 
matical mistakes or inaccuracies, maintaining a scrupu- 
lous caution that the author's meaning and purpose 
should thereby in no degree be changed or affected. 

As this work is intended to be strictly a collection of 
Washington's writings, it is deemed unadvisable to en- 
cumber it with notes and foreign matter, any farther 
than is requisite to explain and properly illustrate the 
text. The notes will for the most part be short, histori- 
cal, and explanatory, touching only on particulars relevant 
to the subject in hand. There will be an Appendix at the

end of each volume for topics, which may demand addi- 
tional inquiry or investigation, and also for original ma- 
terials not suited to the body of the work. 

Should the notes in this First Part seem to trespass 
on the rule of brevity, an apology may be found in the 
fact, that the history of the events upon which they 
have a bearing is but little known, and that hardly any 
of the letters to which they are attached have hitherto 
been published. Some new matter is thrown into the 
Appendix, claiming a place there, as containing biographi- 
cal sketches of Washington's early years, elucidating the 
transactions of his. first campaigns, and, above all, 
vindicating him from a charge, which the French histo- 
rians have wrongfully perpetuated as a spot on the 
brightness of his fame.

BEFORE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 



TO ROBERT DINWIDDIE, LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR 
OF VIRGINIA. 

Alexandria, 9 March, 1754.* 

SIR, 

In my last, by Mr. Stewart, I slightly mentioned the 
objection, which many had against enlisting, to wit, not 
knowing who was to be paymaster, or the times for 
payment. It is now grown a pretty general clamor ; 
and some of those, who were among the first enlisted, 
being needy, and knowing it to be usual for his Maj- 
esty's soldiers to be paid once a week, or at most 

* The letters written previously to this date have been lost. For 
earlier papers see APPENDIX, No. I. 

Washington arrived in Williamsburg, from his mission over the Alle- 
ganies, on the 16th of January, and the Governor and Council resolved to 
enlist two companies, of one hundred men each, and send them to the 
Ohio with orders to construct a fort on that river. The command of the 
two companies was given to Washington. One company was to be raised 
by himself, and the other by Captain Trent, who was to collect his men 
among the traders and people in the back settlements, and proceed imme- 
diately to the place of destination. Major Washington, in the mean time, 
was stationed at Alexandria, till the other company should be completed, 
and the proper military supplies forwarded to that place. 

" Having all things in readiness," says the Governor in his instructions, 
" you are to use all expedition in proceeding to the Fork of the Ohio, with 
the men under your command ; and there you are to finish, in the best 
manner, and as soon as you possibly can, the fort, which I expect is there

every fortnight, are very importunate to receive their 
due. I have soothed and quieted them as much as 
possible, under pretence of receiving your instructions 
in this particular at the arrival of the colonel. 

I have increased my number of men to about 
twenty-five, and dare venture to say, that I should 
have had several more, if the excessive bad weather 
did not prevent their meeting agreeably to their offi- 
cers' commands. 

We daily experience the great necessity for cloth- 
ing the men, as we find the generality of those, who 
are to be enlisted, loose, idle persons, quite destitute 
of house and home, and, I may truly say, many of 
them of clothes ; which last renders them very inca- 
pable of the necessary service, as they must unavoid- 
ably be exposed to inclement weather in their marches, 
and can expect no other than to encounter almost 
every difficulty, that is incident to a soldier's life. 
There are many of them without shoes, others want 
stockings, some are without shirts, and not a few that 
have scarce a coat or waistcoat to their backs. In short, 
they are as ill provided as can well be conceived ; but I 
really believe every man of them, for his own credit's 
sake, is willing to be clothed at his own expense. They 
are perpetually teazing me to have it done, but I am not 
able to advance the money, provided there w r as no risk 
in it, which there certainly is, and too great for me to 
run ; though it would be nothing to the country, as a 
certain part of their pay might be deducted and appro- 

already begun by the Ohio Company. You are to act on the defensive ; 
but, in case any attempts are made to obstruct the works, or interrupt our 
settlements, by any person whatsoever, you are to restrain all such offend- 
ers, or, in case of resistance, to make prisoners of, or kill and destroy 
them. For the rest, you are to conduct yourself as the circumstances of 
the service shall require, and to act as you shall find best for the further- 
ance of his Majesty's service, and the good of this dominion." 






PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 3 

priated to that use. Mr. Carlyle, or any of the merchants 
here, would furnish them with proper necessaries, if 
there was a certainty of any part of their pay being 
stopped to reimburse the expense. 

But I must here in time put a curb to my requests, 
and remember that I ought not to be too importunate ; 
otherwise I shall be as troublesome to you, as the sol- 
diers are to me. Nothing but the necessity of the 
thing could urge me to be thus free ; but I shall no more 
press this affair, as I am well assured, that whatever you 
may think for the benefit of the expedition, you will 
cause to have done. I am, &c. 



TO RICHARD CORBIN. 

March, 1754. 

DEAR SIR, 

In a conversation with you at Green Spring, you 
gave me some room to hope for a commission above 
that of major, and to be ranked among the chief officers 
of this expedition. The command of the whole forces 
is what I neither look for, expect, nor desire ; for 1 
must be impartial enough to confess, it is a charge too 
great for my youth and inexperience to be entrusted 
with. Knowing this, I have too sincere a love for my 
country, to undertake that which may tend to the 
prejudice of it. But if I could entertain hopes, that you 
thought me worthy of the post of lieutenant-colonel, 
and would favor me so far as to mention it at the 
appointment of officers, I could not but entertain a true 
sense of the kindness.

by the ties of friendship and affinity with the Washington family. See

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 22. 

I flatter myself, that, under a skilful commander, or 
man of sense, (whom I most sincerely wish to serve 
under,) with my own application and diligent study of 
my duty, I shall be able to conduct my steps without 
censure, and, in time, render myself worthy of the 
promotion, that I shall be favored with now. I am, Sac. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.* 



Alexandria, 20 March, 1754. 

SIR, 

I was favored with your letter by Mr. Stewart, 
enclosing a lieutenant-colonel's commission, and I hope 
my future behaviour will sufficiently testify the true 
sense I have of this kindness.f 



* Dinwiddie was lieutenant-governor of Virginia, yet, as he was the 
acting governor, all Colonel Washington's letters are addressed to him 
as bearing that title. 

f The Virginia Assembly, at a recent sitting, had voted ten thousand 
pounds towards supporting the expedition to the Ohio. With this aid the 
Governor was induced to increase the military establishment to three 
hundred men, divided into six companies, and Colonel Joshua Fry was 
appointed to command the whole. Major Washington was in consequence 
raised to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and made second in command. 
Ten cannon, and other military equipments, were sent to Alexandria for 
the use of the expedition. These had recently arrived from England. 

As early as the first of March, also, Governor Dinwiddie received a 
letter from the Earl of Holdernesse, enclosing an order to the governor 
of New York to send two Independent companies to Virginia, for the pur- 
pose of cooperating with the forces destined to the Ohio ; and an order to 
the governor of South Carolina to furnish another Independent company 
for the same service. The troops, called Independent Companies, were 
raised in the colonies, under the direction of the governors, but they were 
paid by the King, and the officers had King's commissions. Hence they 
were not subject to colonial regulations, but could be marched to any 
point at the King's command. 

By the laws of Virginia, the militia could not be marched more than five 
miles from the boundary line of the colony. It was doubtful whether the 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 5 

At present there are about seventy-five men at 
Alexandria, near fifty of whom I have enlisted. The 
others have been sent by Messrs. Poison, Mercer, and 
Waggener to this place. Very few officers have re- 
paired hither yet, which has occasioned a fatiguing time 
to me, in managing a number of self-willed, ungovern- 
able people. I shall implicitly obey your commands, 
and march out with all expedition. Major Carlyle is 
now preparing wagons for the conveyance of provisions, 
which till now could not move, on account of the heavy 
roads. 

I doubt not but your Honor has been informed before 
this of Mr. Vanbraam's ill success in Augusta, by the 
express, who was sent from thence for that purpose. 

Major Muse's promotion, and Messrs. Rose and 
Bently's declining, will occasion a w r ant of officers ; in 
which case I would beg leave to mention Mr. Van- 
braam for a command, who is the oldest lieutenant, 
and an experienced soldier. Unless the officers come 
in, I shall be obliged to appoint him to that office, till I 
have your Honor's further directions. It would be con- 



territory invaded by the French was within the limits of Virginia, as the 
western bounds of Pennsylvania had not been defined. Hence the gover- 
nor could not order the militia on this service, but was obliged to rely on 
volunteer enlistments. 

To encourage these enlistments, and give spirit to this enterprise, Gov- 
ernor Dinwiddie issued a proclamation, granting two hundred thousand 
acres of land on the Ohio River, which were to be divided among the officers 
and soldiers engaged in the present expedition. The grant was confirmed 
by the King, but it was not till the war had been long at an end, that the 
land was surveyed and appropriated. This was effected at last chiefly, 
if not entirely, through the active and persevering agency of Washington. 

Governor Dinwiddie wrote to Governor Delancey of New York, that his 
orders from the King were, " to prevent the French and their Indians from 
settling on his lands on the Ohio, and to build two or three forts on that 
river ; and that he had been pleased to send thirty cannon to be mounted 
on those forts, and eighty barrels of gunpowder." Dinwiddie's Manu- 
script Letter-Books, 21 March, 1754.

ferring a very great obligation on him, were you to 
confirm the appointment. I verily believe his behaviour 
would not render him displeasing to you. I have given 
Captain Stephen orders to be in readiness to join us at 
Winchester with his company, as they were already in 
that neighbourhood, and raised there. 

I have nothing further to add at present, but my sin- 
cere thanks for the indulgent favors I have met with, 
and I am your Honor's most obedient, &c. * 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 



SIR, 



Will's Creek, 25 April, 1754. 



Captain Trent's ensign, Mr. Ward, has this day arrived 
from the Fork of the Monongahela, and brings the dis- 
agreeable account, that the fort, on the 17th instant, 
was surrendered at the summons of Monsieur Centre - 
cceur to a body of French, consisting of upwards of one 
thousand men, who came from Venango with eighteen 
pieces of cannon, sixty batteaux, and three hundred 
canoes. They gave him liberty to bring off all his men 
and working-tools, which he accordingly did the same 
day.f 



* Colonel Washington marched from Alexandria on the 2d of April, 
with two companies of troops, and arrived at Will's Creek on the 20th, 
having been joined on the route by a detachment under Captain Stephen. 

f The position occupied by Captain Trent's men was at the junction of 
the Monongahela and Allegany Rivers (now Pittsburg), which had been 
visited by Major Washington on his mission from the governor of Vir- 
ginia to the French, and which he described in his Journal as well situated 
for a fort. The Ohio Company had already a small establishment there. 
When Contrecoeur appeared before the fort, very little progress had been 
oiade in the work. Captain Trent was absent at Will's Creek, and Lieu- 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 7 

Immediately upon this information I called a council 
of war, to advise on proper measures to be taken in this 
exigency. A copy of their resolves, with the proceed- 
ings, I herewith enclose by the bearer, whom I have 
continued express to your Honor for more minute 
intelligence. 

Mr. Ward has the summons with him, and a speech 
from the Half-King,* which I also enclose, with the 
wampum. He is accompanied by one of the Indians 
mentioned therein, who were sent to see where we 
were, what was our strength, and to know the time to 
expect us out. The other young man I have prevailed 
upon to return to the Half- King with the following 
speech. 

" Sachems, Warriors of the Six United Nations, 
Shannoahs, and Delawares, our friends and brethren. I 



tenant Frazier was at his residence ten miles distant. Ensign Ward, 
therefore, was left in the command. His whole number of men amounted 
only to forty-one. 

Contrecoeur approached within a short distance of the fort, halted his 
troops, and sent in an officer with a summons, allowing Ensign Ward an 
hour to consider the subject, and directing him then to repair to the French 
camp with his determination in writing. He immediately counselled with 
the Indians, and the Half-King advised him to inform the French, that 
he was not an officer of rank, nor invested with powers to answer their 
demands, and to request them to wait the arrival of the chief commander. 
He went accordingly with this rnply to the French camp, accompanied by 
the Half-King ; but Contrecceur refused to wait, and demanded an imme- 
diate decision, saying that he should otherwise take possession of the fort 
by force. Hereupon a capitulation was agreed to, and Ensign Ward 
marched off his men the next day, and ascended the Monongahcla to the 
mouth of Red-stone Creek. Contrecceur invited him to supper the even- 
ing of the capitulation, and treated him with much civility. 

A full narrative of the particulars was given under oath by Ensign Ward 
to Governor Dinwiddie, who communicated it to the English government. 
The original is now in the Plantation Office, where it was examined by 
the editor. This seizure of a post by a military force was considered, at 
the time, as the first overt act of hostility in the memorable war which fol- 
lowed, and which raged for seven years both in Europe and America.

8 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 22. 

received your speech by the Buck's brother [Mr. Ward], 
who came to us with the two young men five sleeps 
after leaving you. We return you thanks from hearts 
glowing with affection for your steadfast adherence to 
us, for your kind speech, and for your wise counsels 
and directions to the Buck's brother. 

" The young man will inform you where he met a 
small part of our army advancing towards you, clearing 
the road for a great number of our warriors, who are 
immediately to follow with our great guns, our ammu- 
nition, and our provisions. 

" I could not delay to let you know our hearts, and 
have sent back one of the young men with this speech 
to acquaint you with them. I have sent the other, 
according to your desire, to the governor of Virginia, 
with the Buck's brother, to deliver your speech and 
wampum, and to be an eyewitness of the preparations 
we are making to come in haste to support you, whose 
interest is as dear to us as our lives. We resent the 
usage of the treacherous French, and our conduct will 
henceforth plainly show you how much we have it at 
heart. 

"I cannot be easy without seeing you before our 
forces meet at the fork of the roads, and therefore I 
have the greatest desire that you and Escuniate, or one 
of you, should meet me on the road as soon as possible 
to assist us in council. 

" To assure you of the good will we bear you, and to 
confirm the truth of what has been said, I herewith pre- 
sent to you a string of wampum, that you may thereby 
remember how much I am your brother and friend." 

I hope my proceedings in these affairs will be satis-

asserted in so just a cause, I will defend to the last 
remains of life. 

Hitherto the difficulties I have met with in marching 
have been greater, than I expect to encounter on the 
Ohio, when possibly I may be surrounded by the enemy, 
and these difficulties have been occasioned by those, 
who, had they acted as becomes every good subject, 
would have exerted their utmost abilities to forward our 
just designs. Out of seventy-four wagons impressed 
at Winchester, we got but ten after waiting a week, 
and some of those so badly provided with teams, that 
the soldiers were obliged to assist them up the hills, 
although it was known they had better teams at home. 
I doubt not that in some points I may have strained the 
law; but I hope, as my sole motive was to expedite the 
march, I shall be supported in it, should my authority 
be questioned, which at present I do not apprehend, 
unless some busybody intermeddles.* 

Your Honor will see by the resolves in council, that I 
am destined to the Monongahela with all the diligent des- 
patch in my power. We will endeavour to make the 
road sufficiently good for the heaviest artillery to pass, 
and, when we arrive at Red-stone Creek, fortify our-

to facilitate military movements and operations. But no article could be

allowance for its daily use had been made, by two reputable persons under

not possible to comply literally in every instance with these formalities of

Although the troops now raised were volunteers, and enlisted for a 
special purpose, yet they were regulated in every respect by the militia 
laws of the colony. This was the cause of great inconvenience and em- 
barrassment to Washington afterwards, particularly in regard to discipline, 
as the militia laws were extremely ill suited to an army in active service.

selves as strongly as the short time will allow. I doubt 
not that we can maintain a possession there, till we are 
reinforced, unless the rising of the waters shall admit 
the enemy's cannon to be conveyed up in canoes, and 
then I flatter myself we shall not be so destitute of 
intelligence, as not to get timely notice of it, and make 
a good retreat. 

I hope you will see the absolute necessity for our 
having, as soon as our forces are collected, a number 
of cannon, some of heavy metal, with mortars and gre- 
nadoes to attack the French, and put us on an equal 
footing with them. 

Perhaps it may also be thought advisable to invite 
the Cherokees, Catawbas, and Chickasaws to march to 
our assistance, as we are informed that six hundred 
Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down Scioto 
Creek to join the French, who are coming up the Ohio. 
In that case I would beg leave to recommend their 
being ordered to this place first, that a peace may be 
concluded between them and the Six Nations; for I am 
informed by several persons, that, as no good harmony 
subsists between them, their coming first to the Ohio 
may create great disorders, and turn out much to our 
disadvantage. 

As I had opportunities I wrote to the governors 
of Maryland and Pennsylvania, acquainting them with 
these advices, and enclosed the summons and Indian 
speech, which I hope you will not think me too forward 
in doing. I considered that the Assembly of Maryland 
was to sit in five days, that the Pennsylvania Assembly 
is now sitting, and that, by giving timely notice, some- 
thing might be done in favor of this expedition, which 
now requires all the force we can muster. *

provinces, from New York to South Carolina, setting 1 forth the alarming

By the best information I can get, I much doubt 
whether any of the Indians will be in to treat in May.

amongst us, to be maintained at our expense ? They 
will expect it. I have the honor to be, &LC. 



TO JAMES HAMILTON, GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

Will's Creek, 27 April, 1754. 

SIR, 

It is with the greatest concern I acquaint you, that 
Mr. Ward, ensign in Captain Trent's company, was 
compelled to surrender his small fort at the Fork of 
the Monongahela to the French, on the 17th instant, who 
fell down from Venango, with a fleet of three hundred 
and sixty batteaux and canoes, upwards of one thou- 
sand men, and eighteen pieces of artillery, which they 
planted against the fort, drew up their men, and sent 
the enclosed summons to Mr. Ward, who, having but 

state of affairs in Virginia, and pressing for assistance. But nothing was 
done. Several of the governors brought the matter before their Assem- 
blies, with moving appeals to their patriotism and sympathy. The evil 
was too distant to be felt, and was little heeded. The Assemblies of New 
York and Pennsylvania, and some persons in that of Virginia, professed to 
doubt, whether his Majesty's dominions actually extended to the French 
encroachments. Governor Glen of South Carolina was perplexed with 
similar misgivings. This idea was shocking to the zeal and loyalty of 
Dinwiddie and others, who supposed the question of right to have been 
put at rest by the treaties of Utrecht and Aix-la-Chapelle, and by certain 
diplomatic arrangements with the Indians of recent date. Review of Mili- 
tary Operations in North America, p. 10. Votes of the Assembly of Penn- 
sylvania, Vol. IV. pp. 287-513. .Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. 

Pennsylvania and Maryland were more immediately concerned, as their 
frontiers were threatened. In both these colonies the Assemblies passed 
money bills for general protection, but so clogged with what the governors 
called attacks upon the prerogative, that they would not sign them. Long 
feuds had existed between the governors and the Assemblies on this sub- 
ject of granting money, and the Assemblies were generally adroit enough 
to connect a full assertion of their claims with those cases, in which the

an inconsiderable number of men, and no cannon, to 
make a proper defence, was obliged to surrender. 
They suffered him to draw off his men, arms, and 
working- tools, and gave leave that he might retreat 
to the inhabitants. 

I have heard of your Honor's great zeal for his Maj- 
esty's service, and for all our interests on the present 
occasion. You will see, by the enclosed speech of the 
Half-King, that the Indians expect some assistance from 
you ; and I am persuaded you will take proper notice 
of their moving speech, and their unshaken fidelity. 

I thought it more advisable to acquaint your Honor 
with it immediately, than to wait till you could get intel- 
ligence by the way of Williamsburg and the young man, 
as the Half-King proposes. 

I have arrived thus far with a detachment of one hun- 
dred and fifty men. Colonel Fry, with the remainder 
of the regiment and artillery, is daily expected. In the 
mean time, we advance slowly across the mountains,, 
making the roads, as we march, fit for the carriage of 

public exigencies were the most urgent, hoping thereby to bring the gov- 
ernors to proper terms, and in this they sometimes succeeded. As the 
people gave the money, it was said, they ought to be allowed to raise and 
appropriate it in their own way. To this broad principle the governors 
objected instructions, prerogative, and precedent. 

Governor Dinwiddie's official dignity was severely tried in the affair of 
the ten thousand pounds, granted by the Virginia legislature. By the 
bill, making the grant, a committee was appointed to act in concert with 
the governor in appropriating the money. In writing to the Board of 
Trade, he says, " I would by no means have given my assent to the bill, if 
his Majesty's service had not immediately called for a supply." He 
averred, that the business of appropriating the money, granted for the de- 
fence of the colony, was vested wholly in the hands of the governor. 

He wrote at the same time to the Earl of Halifax : "I am sorry to find 
the House of Burgesses in a republican way of thinking ; and, indeed, 
they do not act in a proper constitutional way, but make encroachments 
upon the prerogative of the crown, in which some former governors have 
submitted too much to them ; and, I fear, without a very particular instruc- 
tion, it will be difficult to bring them to order." Dinwiddie's Letter-Books, 
12 March, 1754.

our great guns ; and are designed to proceed as far as 
the mouth of Red-stone Creek, which enters the Mo- 
nongahela about thirty-seven miles above the fort taken 
by the French, from whence we have a water carriage 
down the river. And there is a storehouse built by 
the Ohio Company, which may serve as a receptacle 
for our ammunition and provisions. 

Besides these French, that came from Venango, we 
have credible accounts, that another party are coming 
up the Ohio. We also have intelligence, that six hun- 
dred of the Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down 
Scioto Creek to join them. I hope your Honor will 
excuse the freedom I have assumed in acquainting you 
with these advices ; it was the warm zeal I owe my 
country, that influenced me to it, and occasioned this 
express. 

I am, with all due respect and regard, your Honor's 
most obedient and very humble servant.* 

* This letter was immediately laid before the legislature by the gov- 
ernor. A bill was then pending for a grant of ten thousand pounds for 
the King's use, but it was obstructed in its progress by the opposition of 
the Governor to the plan proposed by the Assembly for raising the money, 
and no relief was obtained for the expedition. Votes of the Pennsylvania 
Assembly, Vol. IV. p. 313. 

Whatever doubts there may have been in the minds of some members 
of the Assembly, as to the King's title to the Western lands, these doubts 
were not publicly urged as a reason for withholding a grant of money. 
But the truth is, that, when the contest between France and England 
began, neither power had any just title to the lands west of the Ohio 
River. There could be no pretence, by either party, of conquest, pur- 
chase, or occupancy. The French had been accustomed to pass from 
Canada and the Lakes down the Wabash and through the Illinois country 
to Louisiana, and a few English traders had recently gone over the moun- 
tains and bartered with the Indians. The English government had even 
granted five hundred thousand acres of land there to the Ohio Company. 
The claim by the English was founded on the treaties of Utrecht and 
Aix-la-Chapelle, in which France consented that Great Britain should 
have jurisdiction over all the regions possessed by the Iroquois, or Six 
Nations. But there is no proof, that the territory in question belonged to 
the Iroquois. In fact, there is the strongest evidence to the contrary.

TO GOVERNOR DINWJDDIE. 



SIR, 



Little Meadows, 9 May, 1754. 



I acquainted you by Mr. Ward with the determina- 
tion, which we prosecuted four days after his departure, 
as soon as wagons arrived to carry our provisions. 
The want of proper conveyances has much retarded 
this expedition, and at this time it unfortunately delays 
the detachment I have the honor to command. Even 
when we came to Will's Creek, my disappointments 
were not less than before ; for there I expected to find a 
sufficient number of packhorses provided by Captain 
Trent, conformably to his promise, and to Major Car- 
lyle's letters and my own, that I might prosecute my 
first intention with light, expeditious marches ; but instead 
of that, there was none in readiness, nor any in expec- 
tation that I could perceive, which reduced me to the 
necessity of waiting till wagons could be procured from 

The only rightful owners were the Indian occupants, and these were not 
the Iroquois. This point is very clear from the whole tenor of Indian his- 
tory, and is fully confirmed by Heckewelder, though in some things that 
venerable missionary was credulous, and too much influenced by the 
traditions of his favorite Delawares. 

Besides the above memorable treaties of the high European powers, 
Governor Dinwiddie gave great weight to an Indian treaty made at Lan- 
caster, in 1744, between a large number of delegates from the Iroquois 
tribes, and Commissioners from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. 
This treaty was conducted with much parade and formality, after the In- 
dian manner, and the Iroquois professed to give up their claim to the lands 
on the west of the Allegany Mountains for four hundred pounds, paid to 
them by Virginia in money and goods ; but the extent of these lands is 
not defined ; and the Commissioners themselves seem to doubt the title of 
the Iroquois, when they tell them, " We are informed that the Southern 
Indians claim these very lands that you do." During the whole transac- 
tion, which lasted several days, the Indian negociators expressed more 
solicitude about the rum, that was given them from time to time, than the 
affairs of state in which they were engaged. 

There was much good sense, however, in the following remarks of the 
Sachem Gachradodow, in his speech to the Commissioners from Virginia ;

the Branch, forty miles distant. However, in the mean 
time, I detached a party of sixty men to make and mend 
the road, which party since the 25th of April, and the 
main body since the 1st instant, have been laboriously 
employed, and have got no farther than these Meadows, 
about twenty miles from the New Store.* We have 
been two days making a bridge across the river, and 
have not done yet.f

" You know very well, when the white people first came here, they 
were poor ; but they have got our lands, and are hy them become rich, 
and we are now poor ; what little we have had for the land goes soon 
away, but the land lasts for ever." And again ; " The great king might 
send you over to conquer the Indians ; but it looks to us, that God did not 
approve it ; if he had, he would not have placed the great sea where it is, 
as the limits between us and you." Colden's History of the, Five JVafa'orcs, 
Vol. II. pp. 86, 87. 

When Mr. Gist went over the Alleganies, in February, 1751, on a tour 
of discovery for the Ohio Company, " an Indian, who spoke good English, 
came to him, and said that their great man, the Beaver, and Captain 
Oppamyluah, (two Chiefs of the Delawares) desired to know where the 
Indians' land lay, for the French claimed all the land on one side of the 
Ohio River, and the English on the other." This question Mr. Gist found it 
hard to answer, and he evaded it by saying, that the Indians and white men 
were all subjects of the same king, and all had an equal privilege of taking 
up and possessing the land, in conformity with the conditions prescribed 
by the King. Gist's Manuscript Journal. 

* A storehouse, or magazine, established by the Ohio Company at 
Will's Creek. 

f A council of war had been called, when the news of Ensign Ward's 
capitulation reached Will's Creek, in which it was agreed to be impossible 
to march towards the fort without reinforcements ; but it was resolved to 
advance to the mouth of Red-stone Creek on the Monongahela, and raise 
a fortification, clearing the roads on the way, so that the artillery and 
baggage could pass, and there wait for fresh orders. 

The reasons for this decision were, that the mouth of the Red-stone 
was the nearest convenient position on the Monongahela ; that the store- 
houses already built there by the Ohio Company would receive their 
munitions and provisions ; that the heavy artillery might be easily trans- 
ported by water from that place, whenever it should be expedient to attack 
the French fort ; and that by this movement the soldiers would be kept 
from the ill consequences of inaction, and the Indians encouraged to 
remain true to their alliance.

and alter the road, prevent our marching above two, 
three, or four miles a day ; and I fear, though no dili- 
gence shall be spared, that we shall be detained some 
considerable time before it can be made good for the 
carriage of the artillery with Colonel Fry. 

We daily receive intelligence from Ohio by one or 
another of the traders, who are continually retreating to 
the inhabitants with their effects. They all concur, that 
the French are reinforced with eight hundred men; 
and this day, by one Kalendar, I received an account, 
which he sets forth as certain, that there are six hun- 
dred at the Falls of the Ohio, from whence they intend 
to move up to the lower Shawnese Town, at the mouth 
of Scioto Creek, to erect fortresses. He likewise says, 
that the forces at the Fork are erecting their works with 
their whole strength ; and as he was coming he met at 
Mr. Gist's new settlement Monsieur La Force with four 
soldiers, who, under the specious pretence of hunting 
after deserters, were reconnoitring and discovering the 
country. He also brings the agreeable news, -that the 
Half-King has received, and is much pleased with, the 
speech I sent him, and is now upon his march with fifty 
men to meet us. The French down the river are send- 
ing presents and invitations to all the neighbouring 
Indians. 

We have heard nothing from the Catawbas, or any of 
the Southern Indians, though this is the time we mostly 
need their assistance. I have not above one hundred 
and sixty effective men with me, since Captain Trent's 
have left us, whom I discharged from this detachment, 
and ordered them to wait your commands at Captain 
Trent's ; for I found them rather injurious to the other 
men, than serviceable to the expedition, till they could 
be upon the same establishment with us, and come 
under the rigor of martial law. I am, &c.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Youghiogany, 18 May, 1754 

SIR, 

I am heartily concerned, that the officers have such 
real cause to complain of the Committee's resolves ; and 
still more to find my inclinations prone to second their 
just grievances. 

I have endeavoured, as far as I was able, to see in the 
best light I could the trifling advantages that may accrue ; 
yet nothing prevents their throwing down their commis- 
sions, (with gratitude and thanks to your Honor, whose 
good intentions of serving us we are all well assured of,) 
but the approaching danger, which has too far engaged 
their honor to recede till other officers are sent in their 
room, or an alteration made regarding their pay, during 
which time they will assist with their best endeavours 
voluntarily, that is, without receiving the gratuity allowed 
by the resolves of the Committee. 

Giving up my commission is quite contrary to my 
intention. Nay, I ask it as a greater favor, than any 
amongst the many I have received from your Honor, to 
confirm it to me. But let me serve voluntarily ; then I 
will, with the greatest pleasure in life, devote my ser- 
vices to the expedition without any other reward, than 
the satisfaction of serving my country ; but to be slaving 
dangerously for the shadow of pay, through woods, 
rocks, mountains, I would rather prefer the great toil 
of a daily laborer, and dig for a maintenance, provided I 
were reduced to the necessity, than serve upon such 
ignoble terms ; for I really do not see why the lives of 
his Majesty's subjects in Virginia should be of less value, 
than of those in other parts of his American dominions ; 
especially when it is well known, that we must undergo 
double their hardship. 

VOL. II. 3 B * 



18 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. OErr.23. 

I could enumerate a thousand difficulties that we have 
met with, and must expect to meet with, more than other 
officers who have almost double our pay ; but as I know 
you reflect on these things, and are sensible of the hard- 
ships we must necessarily encounter, it would be need- 
less to enlarge. 

Besides, as I have expatiated fully (and, perhaps, too 
warmly) in a letter to Colonel Fairfax, who, I suppose, 
will accompany you to Winchester, upon the motives 
that occasion these my resolves, I shall not trouble you 
with them ; for the subject leads me too far when I 
engage in it.* 

Another thing resolved by the Committee is, that only 
one sergeant and one corporal be allowed to a company ; 
with whom it is as much impossible to do the necessary 
duty, as it is to conquer kingdoms with my handful of 
men. 

Upon the whole, I find so many clogs upon the expe- 



* The Governor was at this time in Winchester, having previously made 
arrangements for meeting there several Indian chiefs, to brighten the 
chain of friendship by a new treaty, or rather to give them presents, and 
exchange belts of wampum. He assigned this as a reason, why Virginia did 
not send delegates to the Albany Convention, which was recommended by 
the Board of Trade, and attended by commissioners from the northern and 
middle colonies, and which acquired notoriety from the celebrated Plan of 
Union drawn up by Franklin, and adopted by the Convention. Thtt 
attempt to treat at Winchester was a failure, as two or three subordinate 
Chiefs only appeared, though Washington used his best endeavours to 
bring down the Half-King and some of his friends. They made excuses, 
that they were planting corn, and engaged in other affairs at home. 

The Albany Plan of Union was disapproved in Virginia, as it was every- 
where else, and by the Governor particularly, because he had already 
matured a project of his own. He communicated the year before to Lord 
Halifax a scheme for colonial government, which he deemed " more rea- 
sonable and more constitutional," than the one proposed by the commis- 
sioners at Albany. The prominent feature of his scheme was, that the 
colonies should be divided into two districts, a northern and southern, in 
each of which there should be a congress, or some kind of general council* 
for the regulation of their respective interests.

dition, that I quite despair of success ; nevertheless, I 
humbly beg it, as a particular favor, that your Honor 
will continue me in the post I now enjoy, the duty 
whereof I will most cheerfully execute as a volunteer, 
but by no means upon the present pay. 

1 hope what I have said will not be taken amiss; for I 
really believe, were it as much in your power, as it is 
your inclination, we should be treated as gentlemen and 
officers, and not have annexed to the most trifling pay, 
that ever W 7 as given to English officers, the glorious 
allowance of soldier's diet, a pound of pork, with 
bread in proportion, per day. Be the consequence what 
it will, I am determined not to leave the regiment, but 
to be amongst the last men that quit the Ohio, even if I 
serve as a private volunteer, which I greatly prefer to 
the establishment we are now upon. I am, &,c. 



Youghiogany, 18 May, 1754 

SIR, 

I received your Honor's favor by Mr. Ward, who 
arrived here last night, just as two Indians came to us 
from the Ohio. 

These Indians contradict the report of the French 
having received reinforcements, though they agree that 
eight hundred men are very shortly expected. Those 
on the spot are busily employed in erecting the fort, 
which they have removed to the point I recommended 
for the country's use, whose walls they have now made 
two fathoms thick, and raised them breast high. 

They are daily sending out scouts, some of whom 
about five days ago were seen within six or seven miles 



20 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [>E T .22. 

of our camp ; but as I did not receive timely notice of 
it, they may have escaped, unless they have fallen in 
with a party sent out about eight days ago to Red- stone 
Creek, to reconnoitre the country thereabouts, and to 
get intelligence of the motions of the French. 

It is imagined that the Half-King will be here in two 
or three days, but to hurry him I have sent the Indian, 
that came up with Mr. Ward, with a short speech, 
acquainting him with my desire of his coming as expe- 
ditiously as possible, to receive the speech which your 
Honor sent by Mr. Ward, and which Colonel Fry wrote 
me I was to deliver. When he arrives I will endeavour 
to send him on to meet you at Winchester. 

These Indians, and all the traders that I have been 
able to get any information from, of late, agree that it is 
almost impracticable to open a road, in which a wagon 
can pass from this to Red-stone Creek. But most of 
them assure me, that, except at one place, water car- 
riage may be had down this river, which will be a most 
advantageous discovery if it proves true, as it will save 
forty miles' land carriage over almost impassable roads 
and mountains. 

The water is now so high, that we cannot possibly 
cross over with our men, which likewise secures us from 
any immediate attacks of the enemy. I have therefore 
resolved to go down the river to the fall, which is at the 
Turkey Foot, to inform myself concerning the nature 
and difficulty attending this fall. I have provided a 
canoe, and shall, with an officer and five men, set out 
upon this discovery to-morrow morning. 

Captain Trent's men, who by their refractory beha- 
viour obliged me to separate them from the other 
soldiers, have now left the New Store and dispersed, 
contrary to my positive orders till they received your 
commands. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 21 

As I shall have frequent communications with the 
Indians, which are of no effect without wampum, I hope 
you will order some to be sent. Indeed, we ought to 
have shirts, and many other things of this sort, which 
are always expected by every Indian that brings a mes- 
sage, or good report Also the chiefs, who visit and 
converse in council, look for the same. If it would not 
be thought too bold in me, I would recommend some 
of the treaty goods to be sent for that purpose with 
Colonel Fry, or after him. This is the method the 
French pursue, and a trifle judiciously bestowed, and in 
season, may turn to our advantage. If I find this river 
navigable, I am convinced it cannot but be agreeable to 
your Honor, that we should build canoes in order to 
convey our artillery down. As the road to this place is 
made as good as it can be, much time and great labor 
having been spent upon it, I believe a wagon may 
travel now with fifteen or eighteen hundred weight, by 
doubling the teams at one or two places only. I am, &c. 



TO COLONEL JOSHUA FRY. 

23 May, 1754. 

SIR, 

This day I returned from my discoveries down the 
Youghiogany, which, I am sorry to say, can never be 
made navigable. We traced the watercourse near 
thirty miles, with the full expectation of succeeding in 
the much desired aim ; but, at length, we came to a fall, 
which continued rough, rocky, and scarcely passable, for 
two miles, and then fell, within the space of fifty yards, 
nearly forty feet perpendicular. * 

* In his Journal, as published by the French government, Colonel Wash- 
ington gives the following account of this tour of discovery. 
" On the 20th of May I embarked in a canoe, with Lieutenant West,

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



As I apprehended there would be difficulty in these 
waters, I sent the soldiers forward upon the road, when 
I left the camp, which was as soon as they could cross ; 
therefore, no time has been lost ; but the roads are so 
exceedingly bad, that we proceed very slow. 

By concurring intelligence, which we received from 
the Indians, the French are not above seven or eight 
hundred strong, and by a late account we are informed, 
that one half of them were detached in the night, with- 
out even the Indians' knowledge, on some secret expe- 
dition ; but the truth of this, though it is affirmed by an 
Indian lately from their fort, I cannot yet vouch for, nor 
tell where they are bound. 



three soldiers, and an Indian. Having followed the river for about half a 
mile we were obliged to go ashore, where we found a trader, who seemed 
to discourage my attempting to seek a passage by water, which caused me 
to change my intention of having canoes made. I ordered the troops to 
wade the river, as the waters had now sufficiently subsided. I continued 
to descend the river, but, finding our canoe too small for six persons, we 
stopped to construct a bark, with which and the canoe we reached Turkey 
Foot just as the night began. Eight or ten miles further onward we 
encountered several difficulties, which were of little consequence. At 
this point we stopped some time to examine the position, and found it well 
suited for a fort, being at the mouth of three branches or small rivers, and 
having a gravelly foundation. 

" We went down about two miles to examine the course of the river, 
which is straight, with many currents, and full of rocks and rapids. We 
crossed it, though the water was high, which induced me to believe the 
canoes would easily pass, but this was not effected without difficulty. 
Besides these rapids we met with others, but, the water being more shallow 
and the current smoother, we passed them easily. We then found the 
water very deep, and mountains rising on both sides. After proceeding 
about ten miles, we came to a fall in the river, which arrested our pro- 
gress, and compelled us to go ashore and desist from any further attempt"

I would recommend, in the strongest terms possible, 
your writing to the Governor for some of the treaty 
goods, or any others suitable for the Indians. Nothing 
can be done without them. All the Indians that come 
expect presents. The French take this method, which 
proves very acceptable; besides, if you want one or 
more to conduct a party, to discover the country, to 
hunt, or for any particular service, they must be bought ; 
their friendship is not so warm, as to prompt them to 
these services gratis ; and that, I believe, every person, 
who is acquainted with the nature of Indians, knows. 
The Indian, that accompanied me down the river, would 
go no further than the Forks, about ten miles, till I 
promised him a ruffled shirt, which I must take from my 
own, and a watch-coat. He said the French always 
had Indians to show them the woods, because they paid 
well for so doing; and this may be laid down as a 
standing maxim amongst them. I think were the goods 
sent out, and delivered occasionally, as you see cause, 
that four or five hundred pounds' worth would do more 
good, than as many thousands given at a treaty. 



design on both sides to effect a reconciliation of difficulties, but neither 
party in reality was solicitous to avoid a war. At length hostilities were 
commenced in time of peace, and each nation charged the other with 
being the aggressor. Two French vessels on their way to Canada were 
taken by the British Admiral Boscawen, and, to justify this procedure, 
the " Observations " above mentioned were published, in which the position 
was maintained, that the French had actually begun the war, by their en- 
croachments with a military force on the Ohio frontiers. To repel this 
charge, the French government circulated among the courts of Europe the 
Mtmoire, whose title is here given, the object of which was to prove, that 
the British had been the first to transgress. 

This Mimoire is curious, as containing many official and other documents 
relating to the question at issue, which are nowhere else to be found, and 
particularly selections from the manuscripts of General Braddock and of 
Washington, which the French had captured at the disastrous battle of 
the Munongahela. Among other things are Braddock's instructions, seve- 
ral of his letters to the ministry, and extracts purporting to be from a

TO GOVERNOR DEYWIDDIE. 

Great Meadows, 27 May, 1754. 

SIR, 

On the 25th ultimo, by an express from Colonel Fry, 
I received the news of your arrival at Winchester, and 
desire of seeing the Half-King and other chiefs of the 
Six Nations. I have by sundry speeches and messages 
invited him, Monacawacha, and others, to meet me, and 
have reason to expect the Half-King is on his way, as 
he only designed to settle his people to planting, at a 
place up the Monongahela chosen for that purpose. 
But fearing something might have retarded his march, 
I immediately, upon the arrival of the express, des- 
patched a messenger with a speech. He is not yet 
returned. About four days ago I received a message 
from the Half- King to the following purport ; 



journal kept by Washington during his preceding campaign. With what 
fidelity these were published cannot now be known, but as it was the 
object of the Memoire to prove a contested point, it may be presumed, that 
such parts of the papers only were brought forward, as would make for 
that end. Coming out as they did, however, under the name and sanction 
of the government, there can be no room for doubt, that the official papers 
at least were given with accuracy. 

These papers were originally published by the French government 
in a duodecimo volume. A copy was soon afterwards found in a French 
prize, that was brought to New York. It was there translated into 
English, and printed the year after its appearance in Paris. The transla- 
tion was hastily executed, and is worthy of little credit, being equally 
uncouth in its style, and faulty in its attempts to convey the sense of the 
original. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 25 

" To the first of his Majesty's officers, whom this 
may concern. 

" It is reported, that the French army is coming to 
meet Major George Washington. I exhort you, there- 
fore, my brethren, to be on your guard against them, 
for they 'intend to strike the first English, whom they 
shall see. They have been on their march two days. 
I know not their number. The Half-King and the rest 
of the Chiefs will be with you in five days to hold a 
council. No more at present, but rny remembrance to 
my brothers the English." 

His account was strengthened in the evening by 
another, that the French were at the Crossing of Yough- 
iogany about eighteen miles distant. I hereupon hur- 
ried to this place as a convenient spot. We have, with 
nature's assistance, made a good entrenchment, and, by 
clearing the bushes out of these meadows, prepared a 
charming field for an encounter. I detached, imme- 
diately upon my arrival here, a small light party of 
horse (wagon horses) to reconnoitre the enemy, and 
discover their strength and motion. They returned 
yesterday without having seen any thing of them; nev- 
ertheless, we were alarmed in the night, and remained 
under arms from two o'clock till near sunrise. We 
conceived them to be our own men, as six of them 
deserted, but cannot be certain whether it was they or 
our enemies. Be it as it will, they were fired at by my 
sentries, but I believe without damage. 

This morning Mr. Gist arrived from his place, where 
a detachment of fifty men was seen yesterday at noon, 
commanded by M. La Force. He afterwards saw their 
tracks within five miles of our camp. I immediately 
detached seventy-five men in pursuit of them, who, I 
hope, will overtake them before they get to Red-stone, 
where their canoes lie. As Mr. Gist has been an eye-

I refer you to him for particulars. I expect my mes- 
senger in to-night from the Half-King, and shall write 
more fully to-morrow by the express that came from 
Colonel Fry. 

The numbers of the French have been greatly mag- 
nified, as your Honor may see by a copy of the enclosed

TO COLONEL JOSHUA FRY. 



SIR, 



Great Meadows^ 29 May, 1754. 



This is by an immediate express, whom I send to 
inform you, that yesterday I engaged a party of French, 
whereof ten were killed, one wounded, and twenty-one 
taken, with the loss of only one of mine killed and two or 
three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant Waggener. 
By some of their papers we can discover, that large 
detachments are expected every day, which we may 
reasonably suppose are to attack us, especially since we 
have begun. 

This is therefore to acquaint you with the necessity 
of a reinforcement, which I hope you will detach imme- 
diately, as you can be in no manner of danger in your 
march ; for the French must pass our camp, which I 
flatter myself is not practicable without my having intel- 
ligence of it, especially as there will be Indians always 
scouting. If a sufficient reinforcement does not come, 
we must either quit our ground and retreat to you, or 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 27 

fight very unequal numbers, which I will do, before I 
will give up one inch of what we have gained. The 
great haste I am in, to despatch the bearer, prevents me 
from being particular at this time. I shall conclude, Sir, 
with assuring you how sincerely concerned I am for 
your indisposition, which I hope you will soon recover 
from, and be able to join us, with the artillery, that we 
may attack the French in their forts. I am, &,c.* 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Camp at the Great Meadows, 29 May, 1754. 

SIR, 

In answering your letter by Mr. Birney, I shall begin 
with assuring you, that nothing was farther from my 
intentions than to recede, though I then pressed, and 

* Colonel Fry died at Will's Creek two days after this letter was 
written, and the command of the expedition devolved of course on Wash- 
ington, as second in rank. Reinforcements were forwarded, so that the 
whole number of troops under his immediate command amounted to some- 
what more than three hundred. 

The death of Colonel Fry was considered an essential loss to the 
service. He was horn in Somersetshire, England, and educated at Oxford. 
Excelling in the mathematical sciences, he was at one time Professor of 
the Mathematics in the college of William and Mary ; and, after resigning 
that station, he was a member of the House of Burgesses, and otherwise 
employed in public affairs, particularly in running the boundary line at the 
westward between Virginia and North Carolina. In conceit with Peter 
Jefferson he made a map of Virginia, which had much repute. By these 
employments he had gained such a knowledge of the interior country, as, 
with other qualifications, pointed him out for this command. He was one 
of the commissioners from the government of Virginia for making a treaty 
with the Indians at Logstown, June, 1752. In a notice of him written at 
the time, it is said, " he was a man of so clear a head, so mild a temper, 
and so good a heart, that he never failed to engage the love and esteem 
of all who knew, or were concerned with him, and he died universally 
lamented."

still desire, that my services may be voluntary, rather 
than on the present pay. I am much concerned, that 
you should seem to charge me with ingratitude for your 
generous, though undeserved favors ; for I assure you, 
Sir, nothing is more a stranger to my breast, or a sin 
that my soul more abhors, than that black and detest- 
able one of ingratitude. I retain a true sense of your 
kindness, and want nothing but opportunity to give my 
testimony of willingness to oblige you, as far as my life 
or fortune will extend. 

I could not object to the pay before I knew it. I 
dare say you remember, that the amount allowed by the 
first estimate to a lieutenant-colonel was fifteen shillings, 
and to a major twelve shillings and sixpence, of which I 
then complained very much, till your Honor assured me 
that we were to be furnished with proper necessaries, 
and offered that as a reason why the pay was less than 
that of British officers. After this, when you were so 
kind as to prefer me to the command I now hold, and 
at the same time informed me, that I was to have but 
twelve shillings and sixpence, after this, influenced also by 
some other reasons, I was induced to acquaint Colonel 
Fairfax with my intention of resigning, which he must 
well remember, as it happened at Bellhaven ; and it was 
there that he dissuaded me from it, and promised to 
represent the trifling pay to you, who would endeavour 
(as I at the same time told him that the Speaker thought 
the officers' pay too small) to have it enlarged. 

As to the numbers that applied for commissions, and 
to whom we were preferred, I believe, had those gen- 
tlemen been as TV ell acquainted with this country, and 
as sensible of the difficulties that would attend a cam- 
paign here as I then was, that your Honor would not 
have been so troublesomely solicited as you were. Yet 
I do not offer this as a reason for quitting the service. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 29 

For my own part I can answer, that I have a constitu- 
tion hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most 
severe trials, and, I flatter myself, resolution to face 
what any man dares, as shall be proved when it comes 
to the test, which I believe we are upon the borders of. 

There is nothing, Sir, I believe, more certain, than 
that the officers in the Canada expedition had British 
pay allowed, while they were in the service.* Lieu- 
tenant Waggener, Captain Trent, and several others, 
whom I have conversed with on that head, and who 
were engaged in that expedition, affirm it for truth. 
Therefore, Sir, as this cannot be allowed, suffer me to 
serve as a volunteer, which, I assure you, will be the 
next reward to British pay; for, as my services, so far as 
I have knowledge, shall equal those of the best officer, 
I make it a point of honor not to serve for less, or accept 
a medium. 

Nevertheless, I have communicated your sentiments 
to the other officers, and, as far as I could put on the 
hypocrite, set forth the advantages that may accrue, and 
advised them to accept the terms, as a refusal might 
reflect dishonor upon their character, leaving it to the 
world to assign what reason it pleases for their quitting 
the service. I am very sensible of the pernicious con- 



* This Canada expedition was the one projected by Governor Shirley, 
and approved by the British government, in 1746, during the previous war 
between England and France. The memorable capture of Louisburg the 
year preceding, effected mainly by colonial troops from Massachusetts, 
had raised to a high pitch the martial spirit of the people ; and large num- 
bers were easily enlisted for this new expedition, in the northern and 
middle provinces. They were disbanded the next year, without having 
accomplished any thing, but were all paid at the same rate as the troops 
on the King's establishment Belknap's History of New Hampshire, Vol. 
H. p. 235. 

From the tenor of this letter to Governor Dinwiddie, it is evident, that 
the parsimony of the Virginia government, on this occasion, was as ill- 
judged as it was unprecedented. 

^ * 



30 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [J3x. 22. 

sequences that will attend their resigning, as they have 
gained some experience of the military art, have a 
tolerable knowledge of the country, having been most 
of them sent out at different times with parties, and are 
now accustomed to the hardships and fatigues of living 
as we do, which, I think, were it truly stated, would 
prevent your Honor from many troublesome solicitations 
from others for commissions. This last motive has 
induced and will induce me to do what I can to recon- 
cile matters, though I really believe there are some, who 
will not remain long without an alteration. They have 
promised to consider it, and give you an answer. I 
was not ignorant of the allowance, which Colonel Fry 
has for his table ; but, being a dependent there myself, I 
am deprived of the pleasure of inviting an officer, or 
friend, which to me would be more agreeable, than any 
benefits I shall meet with there. 

And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more 
in your letter on this head, which, too, is more fully 
expressed in a paragraph of Colonel Fairfax's letter to 
me, as follows; "If, on the British establishment, 
officers are allowed more pay, the regimentals they are 
obliged annually to furnish, and their necessary table 
and other incidental expenses, being considered, little 
or no savings will be their portion." 

I believe it is well known, that we have been at the 
expense of regimentals, and it is still better known, that 
regimentals, and every other necessary, which we were 
under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this 
expedition, were not to be bought for less in Virginia cur- 
rency, than they would cost British officers in sterling 
money ; which ought to have been the case, to put us 
upon a parity in this respect. Then Colonel Fairfax 
observes, that their table and other incidental charges 
prevent them from saving much. They have the enjoy- 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 31 

ment of their pay, which we neither have in one sense 
nor the other. We are debarred the pleasure of good 
living ; and, Sir, I dare say you will acknowledge, that, 
with one who has always been used to it, it must go 
somewhat hard to be confined to a little salt provision 
and water, and to do duty, hard, laborious duty, which is 
almost inconsistent with that of a soldier, and yet have 
the same reductions as if he were allowed luxuriously. 
My pay, according to the British establishment and 
common exchange, Avould be near twenty shillings per 
day ; in the room of which, the Committee (for I cannot 
in the least imagine your Honor had any hand in it) has 
provided twelve shillings and sixpence, so long as the 
service continues, whereas one half of the other is con- 
firmed to British officers for life. Now if we should 
be fortunate enough to drive the French from the Ohio, 
as far as your Honor would please to have them sent, in 
any short time, our pay will not be sufficient to discharge 
our first expenses. 

I would not have you imagine from this, that I have 
said all these things to have the pay increased, but to 
justify myself, and show you that our complaints are not 
frivolous, but founded upon strict reason. For my own 
part, it is a matter almost indifferent whether I serve for 
full pay, or as a generous volunteer; indeed, did my 
circumstances correspond with my inclinations, I should 
not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter ; for the 
motives that have led me here are pure and noble ; I 
had no view of acquisition, but that of honor, by serving 
faithfully my king and country. 

As you have t recommended Mr. Willis, you may 
depend I shall with pleasure do all I can for him. 
But above all, Sir, you may rely, that I shall take 
all possible means of procuring intelligence, and guard- 
ing against surprises; and be assured nothing but 



32 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. ^ET. 22. 



very unequal numbers shall compel me to submit or 
retreat. 

Now, Sir, as I have answered your letter, I shall beg 
leave to acquaint you with what has happened since I 
wrote by Mr. Gist. I then informed you, that I had 
detached a party of seventy-five men to meet fifty of 
the French, who, we had intelligence, were upon their 
march towards us. About nine o'clock the same night 
I received an express from the Half-King, who w? 
encamped with several of his people about six miles off, 
that he had seen the tracks of two Frenchmen crossing 
the road, and that, behind, the whole body were lying 
not far off, as he had an account of that number passing 
Mr. Gist's. 

I set out with forty men before ten, and it was from 
that time till near sunrise before we reached the Indians' 
camp, having marched in small paths, through a heavy 
rain, and a night as dark as it is possible to conceive. 
We were frequently tumbling one over another, and 
often so lost, that fifteen or twenty minutes' search 
would not find the path again. 

When we came to the Half- King, I counselled with 
him, and got his assent to go hand-in-hand and strike 
the French. Accordingly, he, Monacawacha, and a few 
other Indians set out with us ; and when we came to the 
place where the tracks were, the Half-King sent two 
Indians to follow their tracks, and discover their lodge- 
ment, which they did at half a mile from the road, in a 
very obscure place surrounded with rocks. I thereupon, 
in conjunction with the Half-King and Monacawacha, 
formed a disposition to attack them on all sides, which 
we accordingly did, and, after an engagement of about 
fifteen minutes, we killed ten, wounded one, and took 
twenty -one prisoners. Amongst those killed was M. de 
Jumonville, the commander. The principal officers 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 33 

taken are M. Drouillon and M. La Force, of whom your 
Honor has often heard me speak, as a bold enterprising 
man, and a person of great subtlety and cunning. With 
these are two cadets. 

These officers pretend they were coming on an em- 
bassy; but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring, as 
you will see by the Instructions and Summons enclosed. 
Their instructions were to reconnoitre ^the country, 
roads, creeks, and the like, as far as the Potomac, which 
they were about to do. These enterprising men weie 
purposely chosen out to procure intelligence, which they 
were to send back by some brisk despatches, with the 
mention of the day that they were to serve the sum- 
mons ; which could be with no other view, than to get 
a sufficient reinforcement to fall upon us immediately 
after. This, with several other reasons, induced all the 
officers to believe firmly, that they were sent as spies, 
rather than any thing else, and has occasioned my 
detaining them as prisoners, though they expected, or 
at least had some faint hope, that they should be con- 
tinued as ambassadors. 

They, finding where we were encamped, instead of 
coming up in a public manner, sought out one of the 
most secret retirements, fitter for a deserter than an 
ambassador to encamp in, and stayed there two or three 
days, sending spies to reconnoitre our camp, as we are 
told, though they deny it. Their whole body moved 
back near two miles, and they sent off two runners to 
acquaint Contrecoeur with our strength, and where we 
were encamped. Now thirty-six men would almost 
have been a retinue for a princely ambassador, instead 
of a petit. Why did they, if their designs were open, 
stay so long within five miles of us, without delivering 
their message, or acquainting me with it ? Their wait- 
ing could be with no other design, than to get detach- 

VOL. II. 5 



34 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 22. 

ments to enforce the summons, as soon as it was given. 
They had no occasion to send out spies, for the name 
of an ambassador is sacred among all nations; but it 
was by the track of those spies, that they were dis- 
covered, and that we got intelligence of them. They 
would not have retired two miles back without deliver- 
ing the summons, and sought a skulking-place (which, 
to do them justice, was done with great judgment), but 
for some special reason. Besides, the summons is so 
insolent, and savors so much of gasconade, that if two 
men only had come to deliver it openly, it would have 
been too great an indulgence to send them back.* 

* In the part of Washington's Journal published by the French govern- 
ment, among the Pieces Justiftcatives attached to the Mtmoire heretofore 
mentioned, the narrative of this affair is related nearly in the same words, 
as will be seen by the following extract. 

" As I marched on with the prisoners (after the action), they informed 
me, that they had been sent with a summons for me to depart ; a specious 
pretext, that they might discover our camp, and reconnoitre our force and 
situation. This was so evident, that I was astonished at their assurance 
in telling me, that they came as an embassy. By their instructions they 
were to obtain a knowledge of the roads, rivers, and country, as far as the 
Potomac. Instead of coming as an ambassador, public, and in an open 
manner, they came secretly, and sought out the most hidden retreats, 
much better suited for deserters than an ambassador. Here they en- 
camped, here they remained concealed for whole days together within five 
miles of us. They sent out spies to reconnoitre our camp. The whole 
body then moved back two miles. Thence they sent messengers, aa 
directed in the instructions, to acquaint M. Contrecoeur with the place we 
were in, and with our disposition, that he might forward his detachments 
to enforce the summons, as soon as it should be given. 

" An ambassador has no need of spies ; his character is always sacred. 
Since they had so good an intention, why should they remain two days 
within five miles of us, without giving me notice of the summons, or of 
any thing which related to their embassy ? This alone would be sufficient 
to raise the strongest suspicions ; and the justice is certainly due them, 
that, as they wished to conceal themselves, they could not have chosen 
better places than they did." See Mtmoire, &c. p. 127. 

" They pretend that they called to us, as soon as we were discovered, 
which is absolutely false ; for I was at the head of the party in approaching 
them, and I can affirm, that, as soon as they saw us, they ran to their arms 
without calling, which I should have heard, if they had done so." p. 129. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 35 

The sense of the Half-King on this subject is, that 
they have bad hearts, and that this is a mere pretence ; 
that they never designed to come to us but in a hostile 
manner, and if we were so foolish as to let them go 
again, he never would assist us in taking another of 
them. Besides, La Force would, if released, I really 
think, do more to our disservice, than fifty other men, 
as he is a person whose active spirit leads him into all 
parties, and has brought him acquainted with all parts 
of the country. Add to this a perfect use of the Indian 
tongue, and great influence with the Indians. He in- 
genuously enough confessed, that, as soon as he saw 
the commission and instructions, he believed,* and then 
said he expected some such tendency, though he pre- 
tends to say he does not believe the commander had 
any other than a good design. 

In this engagement we had only one man killed and 
two or three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant 
Waggener slightly, a most miraculous escape, as our 
right wing was much exposed to their fire and received 
it alLf 

The Half-King received your Honor's speech very 
kindly, but desired me to inform you, that he could not 
leave his people at this time, thinking them in great 
danger. He is now gone to the Crossing for their fami- 
lies, to bring them to our camp ; and he desired I would 
furnish some men and horses to assist them up, which I 
have accordingly done. I have sent thirty men and 

* That is, he believed there was some hostile intention. La Force 
appears not to have seen the instructions, which were in possession of 
M. Jumonville. Whether he knew their import before his capture is 
doubtful. 

The original Summons and Instructions are printed among the Pieces 
Justificatives affixed to the Mimoirt of the French government 

f Washington and his soldiers were on the right, and the Indians on 
the left.

upwards of twenty horses. He says, if your Honor has 
any thing to say, you may communicate it by me, and 
that, if you have a present for them, it may be kept till 
another occasion, after sending out some things for their 
immediate use. He has declared that he will send these 
Frenchmen's scalps, with a hatchet, to all the nations of 
Indians in union with them, and did that very day give a 
hatchet, and a large belt of wampum, to a Delaware man 
to carry to Shingiss.* He promised me to send down the 
river for all the Mingoesf and Shawanees to our camp, 
where I expect him to-morrow with thirty or forty men, 
and their wives and children, to" confirm what he has 
said here. He has sent your Honor a string of wampum. 

As these runners went off to the fort on Sunday last,t 
I shall expect every hour to be attacked, and by une- 
qual numbers, which I must withstand if there are five 
to one; for I fear the consequence will be, that we shall 
lose the Indians, if we suffer ourselves to be driven 
back. I despatched an express immediately to Colonel 
Fry with this intelligence, desiring him to send me rein- 
forcements with all imaginable speed. 

Your Honor may depend I will not be surprised, let 
them come at what hour they will ; and this is as much 
as I can promise. But my best endeavours shall not 
be wanting to effect more. I doubt not, if you hear 
I am beaten, but you will hear at the same time, that 
we have done our duty, in fighting as long as there was 
a shadow of hope. 

I have sent Lieutenant West, accompanied by Mr.

f Mr. Gist, who visited the Twigtwees in February, 1751, described them 
as follows. " The Twigtwees are a very numerous people, consisting of 
many different tribes under the same form of government. Each tribe 
has a particular chief, or king, one of whom is chosen indifferently out of 
any tribe to rule the whole nation, and is vested with greater authority 
than any of the others. They are accounted the most powerful nation to 
the westward of the English settlements, and much superior to the Six 
Nations, with whom they are now in amity. They formerly lived on the 
farther side of the Wabash, and were in the French interest. They have 
now revolted from them, and have left their former habitations for the sake 
of trading with the English." The town visited by Mr. Gist was on the 
North bank of the Miami river, about a hundred and fifty miles from its 
mouth. The town consisted of about four hundred families. Gist's MS. 
Journal. Wynne says that the Twigtwee Indians were the same as the 
Ottawas. The French wrote the name Tuigtuis.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Camp at the Great Meadows, 29 May, 1754. 

SIR, 

The bearer hereof, Monsieur Drouillon, and Monsieur 
La Force and two cadets, I beg leave to recommend 
to your particular notice, as prisoners of war, and officers 
whom I had the honor of taking. 

I have assured them, that they will meet with all the 
respect and favor due to their character and personal 
merit ; and I hope they will do me the justice to in- 
form you, that I have neglected no means in my power 
to render their confinement easy here. 

Lieutenant West will conduct these gentlemen, with 
sixteen privates, prisoners, to your Honor at Winchester, 
who will acquaint you with the profound respect with 
which I am your Honor's most obedient and most hum- 
ble servant. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Without date. 

SIR, 

Since writing my last I have still stronger presump- 
tion, indeed almost confirmation, that they were sent as 
spies, and were ordered to wait near us, till they were 
truly informed of our intentions, situation, and strength, 
and were to have acquainted their commander there- 
with, and to have lain lurking here for reinforcements 
before they served the summons, if served at all. 

I doubt not but they will endeavour to amuse you 

ter. He was afterwards killed at Braddock's defeat. Vanbraam was a 
Dutchman, and had the year before been Washington's interpreter, in his 
mission from the governor of Virginia to visit the French posts on the Ohio

with many smooth stories, as they did me ; but they 
were confuted in them all, and, by circumstances too 
plain to be denied, almost made ashamed of their asser- 
tions. I dare say you will treat them with respect, 
which is due to all unfortunate persons in their condition. 
But I hope you will give no ear to what they will have 
an opportunity for displaying to the best advantage, 
having none present to contradict their reports. 

I have heard, since they went away, that they should 
say they called to us not to fire; but that I know to be 
false, for I was the first man that approached them, and 
the first whom they saw, and immediately upon it they 
ran to their arms, and fired briskly till they were 
defeated. 

We have heard of another being killed by the Indians, 
that made his escape from us ; so that we are certain of 
thirty-three killed and taken.* I thought it expedient 
to acquaint your Honor with the above, as I fancy they 
will have the assurance of asking the privileges due to 
an embassy, when in strict justice they ought to be 
hanged as spies of the worst sort, being authorized by 
their commander, at the expense of a character, which 
should be sacred to all nations, and never trifled with or 
used in an equivocal way. t I am, &c. 

* It appears by M. de Contrecceur's orders to M. de Jumonville, (See 
Mtmoire, &c. p. 104) that his party consisted of thirty-five men, that is, 
himself and another officer, three cadets, a volunteer, an interpreter, and 
twenty-eight soldiers. Two of the party had returned the day before, whose 
tracks had been seen by the Half-King, as he reported to Colonel Wash- 
ington, thus leaving thirty-three, who were engaged in the skirmish. As 
two cadets only were taken, one of the men, who returned, must have 
been a cadet. 

f For other particulars respecting this skirmish, see APPENDIX, No. II. 

In Horace Walpole's Memoirs of George the Second is the following 
passage. 

" In the express, which Major Washington despatched on his preceding 
little victory, (the skirmish with Jumonville), he concluded with these

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 



SIR, 



Great Meadows, 10 June, 1754. 



Yours I received by the post, and return you my 
hearty thanks for your kind congratulation on our late 
success, which I hope to improve without risking the 
imputation of rashness, or hazarding what a prudent 
conduct would forbid. I rejoice that I am likely to be 
happy under the command of an experienced officer, 
and man of sense. It is what I have ardently wished 

words, ' / heard the bullets whistle, and, believe me, there is something 
charming in the sound. 1 On hearing of this the king said sensibly, ' He 
would not say so, if he had been used IQ hear many. 1 However, this brave 
braggart learned to blush for his rhodomontade, and, desiring to serve 
General Braddock as aid-de-camp, acquitted himself nobly." Vol. I. 
p. 347. 

The above letter is the despatch communicated by Major Washington 
to Governor Dinwiddie, giving an account of the rencounter with Jumon- 
ville's party, a copy of which was probably sent by the Governor to 
England. It contains nothing about the whistling of bullets, nor is such a 
sentiment uttered in any of his letters, that have been preserved. As the 
writer refers to no authority, it may be presumed, that he had none but 
rumor, either for the saying of Washington, or the more sensible reply of 
the King. Yet this anecdote is not wholly without foundation, if we may 
rely on a statement of Gordon, in which he says ; "A gentleman, who 
had heard the Reverend Mr. Davies relate, that Colonel Washington had 
mentioned, he knew of no music so pleasing as the whistling of bullets, 
being alone in conversation with him at Cambridge, asked him whether it 
was as he had related. The General answered, ' If I said so, it was when 
I was young.' " Gordon's History, Vol. II. p. 203. 

The Memoirs of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, quoted above, are 
understood to have been written near the time of the events, but they were 
not published till after his death. The Editor remarks, in a note on the 
word braggart, "It is wonderful, that Lord Orford should have allowed 
this expression to remain, after he had lived to witness and admire the 
subsequent career of that great man General Washington." It may be 
added, that it was not by his own desire, but at the solicitation of General 
Braddock, that Washington joined him as aid-de-camp. 

There is another passage in these Memoirs, purporting to have been 
written in 1754, which is remarkable for the declaration with which it 
concludes. The author is censuring the government for the course pur-

for. * I shall here beg leave to return my grateful thanks 
for your favor in promoting me to the command of the 
regiment. Believe me, Sir, when I assure you, that my 
breast is warmed with every generous sentiment, which 
your goodness can inspire. I want nothing but oppor- 
tunity to testify my sincere regard for your person, to 
whom I stand indebted for so many unmerited favors. 

Your Honor may depend, I shall myself, and will 
endeavour to make my officers, show Captain Mackay 
all the respect due to his rank and merit ; but I should 
have been particularly obliged, if you had declared 
whether he was under my command, or independent of 
it.f However, I shall be studious to avoid all disputes 
that may tend to the public prejudice, but, as far as I 
am able, will inculcate harmony and unanimity. I hope 
Captain Mackay will have more sense, than to insist 
upon any unreasonable distinction because he and his 
officers have commissions from his Majesty. Let him 
consider, though we are greatly inferior in respect to 
advantages of profit, yet we have the same spirit to 
serve our gracious King as they have, and are as ready 

sued towards the colonies, and observes ; " The instructions to Sir Dan- 
vers Osborn, a new governor of New York, seemed better calculated for 
the latitude of Mexico, and for a Spanish tribunal, than for a free, rich 
British settlement, and in such opulence and such haughtiness, that sus- 
picions had long been conceived of their meditating to throw off their depend- 
ence on the mother country" Vol. I. p. 343. 

* Colonel Innes, from North Carolina, had arrived with about three 
hundred and fifty troops, raised in that colony. He was now at Winches- 
ter. After Colonel Fry's death, he had been appointed, by Governor Din- 
widdie, commander-in-chief of all the forces destined for the western 
expedition. Colonel Washington was promoted to the command of the Vir- 
ginia regiment. The North Carolina troops never joined him, nor rendered 
any service. Colonel Innes had been an officer in the former war, and 
was intimate with Major Lawrence Washington at the siege of Car 
thagena. 

f Captain Mackay commanded an Independent Company of one hundred 
men from South Carolina, who were now on their march from Alexandria 
to join Colonel Washington.

and willing to sacrifice our lives for our country's good. 
And here, once more, and for the last time, I must say, 
'that it will be a circumstance, which will act upon some 
officers of this regiment beyond all measure, to be 
obliged to serve upon such different terms, when their 
lives, their fortunes, and their operations are equally, and, 
I dare say, as effectually exposed, as those of others, 
who are happy enough to have King's commissions. 

I have been solicitous on this head, and have earnestly 
endeavoured to reconcile the officers to their appoint- 
ments, and flatter myself that I have succeeded, having 
heard no mention thereof lately. I considered the per- 
nicious consequences, that would attend a disunion, and 
was therefore too much attached to my country's inter- 
ests to suffer it to ripen, after I received your letters. 

I am very thankful to you for ordering an assort- 
ment of Indian goods, which we daily find still more 
necessary. I shall take care, while they are under my 
direction, that they are judiciously applied, and shall 
be particularly careful in consulting Mr. Croghan and 
Mr. Montour, by whom I shall be advised in all Indian 
affairs agreeably to your directions. * 

I shall with great pleasure wear the medal, which you 
were pleased to compliment me with, and shall present 
the others to Indian chiefs, as I have already done one 
to the Half-King. 

We have been extremely ill used by Major Carlyle's 
deputies, which I am heartily sorry for, since he is a 
gentleman so capable of the business himself, and has 
taken so much pains to give satisfaction. He, I believe, 
has been deceived, and we have suffered by those 

* Croghan was an Indian trader of note, and had been employed on 
public affairs in the Indian country by the governor of Pennsylvania. 
Montour was a Canadian, and also an Indian trader and interpreter. He 
was of Indian extraction, and a man of weight among the Six Nations. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 43 

under him, and by those who have contracted for pro- 
visions. We have been six days without flour, and 
there is none upon the road for our relief that we know 
of, though I have by repeated expresses given him timely 
notice. We have not provisions of any sort enough in 
camp to serve us two days. Once before we should 
have been four days without provisions, if Providence 
had not sent a trader from the Ohio to our relief, for 
whose flour I was obliged to give twenty-one shillings 
and eight pence per hundred. 

In a late letter to Major Carlyle, I have complained 
of the tardiness of his deputies. I likewise desired, that 
suitable stores of ammunition might be sent up speedily, 
for till that is done we have it not in our power to 
attempt any advantageous enterprise ; but must wait its 
arrival at Red-stone, for which I shall set off the moment 
provisions arrive to sustain us on the march. Major 
Carlyle mentioned a contract he had made with Mr. 
Croghan for flour, likewise Mr. Croghan's offer of fur- 
nishing more if required. I have therefore desired to 
have all that Mr. Croghan can furnish. 

Major Muse, with Captain Montour, joined us yester- 
day, and brought the wampum you sent to the Half- 
King, which I presented, with the medal and speech. 
He is very thankful for the notice you have taken of 
him. Major Muse brought nine of the swivels, with 
some powder and balls ; and this day I have engaged 
fifty or sixty horses to bring up more of the balls and 
other stores from Will's Creek, if there should be no 
provisions to load them with. The balls are to be 
brought in leather bags made for the purpose. I hear 
that Captain Mackay, who was to have brought the 
artillery, has marched without it, as wagons could not 
be procured. I shall write to Mr. Gist to procure wag- 
ons, if he is obliged to go to Pennsylvania for them, to 



44 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [>ET. 2H. 

bring out the artillery, if not, when Colonel Innes comes 
up we shall have nothing in readiness, and shall let slip 
this best season for action. 

The Indians are drawing off from the River daily, one 
of whom last night brought news of Monacawacha. He 
went from Logstown about five nights ago with the 
French scalps, and four hatchets, with which he intended 
to visit the four tribes of Indians between this and Lake 
Erie, and present to each tribe a scalp and hatchet, and 
at the same time acquaint them that it was expected, 
as the English and Six Nations had hand-in-hand 
struck the French, they would join our forces. This 
messenger likewise says, that Monacawacha was deter- 
mined not only to counsel with the chiefs of those tribes, 
but with their great warriors also, which is customary in 
these cases, and was to return as soon as possible, 
which he imagined would be in fifteen days; but in 
case he should not return in that time, he left orders 
for the Indians at Logstown to set off for Red-stone 
Creek, so that they would all meet at Red-stone to join 
their brothers the English. He also desired there might 
be no attack made against the French fort, till he should 
return, by which time he hoped all the forces would be 
gathered, and then they would make a general attack 
together, and gain a complete victory at once. 

The Half-King has sent messengers to other places 
for warriors, who are to meet us also at Red-stone 
Creek. Besides these, he has sent two messengers, 
by the advice of Mr. Croghan, Mr. Montour, and myself, 
one to invite the Shawanees to come and receive one 
of their men, who was imprisoned in Carolina, and to 
counsel with us, and the other to the Delawares for the 
same purpose, as we hear both these nations have 
accepted the hatchet against us. This report was first 
brought by an Indian sent from Logstown to the Half-

King, and since confirmed by nine French deserters, 
who arrived at our camp to-day. These men farther 
say, that the fort at the Fork is completed, and proof 
against any attempts, but with bombs, on the land side. 
There were not above five hundred men in it, when 
they left it, but they suppose by this time two hundred 
more are arrived. Nine hundred were ordered to fol- 
low them, who might be expected in fourteen or fifteen 
days. 

I was as much disappointed when I met these persons 
to-day, as ever I was in my life. By misunderstanding 
the scouts that brought me intelligence, that is, mistak- 
ing ninety for nine, I marched out at the head of one 
hundred and thirty men (the major part of the effective 
men in the regiment), full with the hope of procuring 
another present of French prisoners for your Honor. 
Judge then my disappointment at meeting nine only, 
and those coming for protection. I guarded against all 
casualties, that might happen to the camp, and ordered 
Major Muse to repair into the fort, and erect the small 
swivels for the defence of the place, which he could do 
in an hour's time. 

Agreeably to your desire I shall here mention the 
names of the gentlemen, who are to be promoted. 
Lieutenant George Mercer will worthily succeed to a 
captaincy. Captain Vanbraam has acted as captain 
ever since we left Alexandria. He is an experienced, 
good officer, and very worthy of the command he has 
enjoyed. Mr. James Towers is the oldest ensign, for 
whom you will please to send a lieutenancy. To Cap- 
tain Stephen I have already given a major's commission, 
finding one blank among Colonel Fry's papers. If 
merit, Sir, will entitle a gentleman to your notice, 
Mr. Peyrouny may justly claim a share of your favor. 
His conduct has been governed by the most consum- 



46 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [MT.2& 

mate prudence, and all his actions have sufficiently 
testified his readiness to serve his country, which I 
really believe he looks upon Virginia to be. He was 
sensibly chagrined, when I acquainted him with your 
pleasure, of giving him an ensigncy. This he had twelve 
years ago, and long since commanded a company. 
He was prevailed on by Colonel Fry, when he left 
Alexandria, to accept the former commission, and assist 
my detachment, as I had very few officers, till we all 
met on the Ohio, which commission he would now have 
resigned, and returned to Virginia, but for my great 
dissuasion to the contrary. I have promised to solicit 
your Honor to appoint him adjutant, and continue him 
ensign, which will induce a very good officer to remain 
in the regiment. The office of adjutant, Sir, is most 
necessary to a regiment, in distributing the daily orders, 
receiving all reports, and seeing orders executed. In 
short, an adjutant is an indispensable officer. Should 
you be pleased to indulge me in this request, I shall 
look upon it in a very particular light, as I think the 
personal merit of the gentleman, his knowledge of mili- 
tary duty, and his activity will render him highly worthy 
of the favor. An ensign is still wanting, whom I hope 
you will send, if you know of any one suitable for the 
office. A young man in the camp, who came with 
Captain Lewis, has solicited, but I am yet ignorant of 
his character and qualities. He is a volunteer, and 
recommended by Captain Lewis. 

In a letter by Mr. Ward, you acquainted me, that 
you had given orders to Colonel Fry to examine into 
the proceedings of Captain Trent, and his lieutenant, 
Frazier, by a court-martial. I shall be glad if you will 
repeat your orders and instructions to me, or rather 
to Colonel Innes ; for an officer cannot be tried by those 
of his own regiment only, but has a right to be heard 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 47 

in a general court-martial. Captain Trent's behaviour 
has been very tardy, and has convinced the world of 
what they before suspected, his great timidity. Lieu- 
tenant Frazier, though not altogether blameless, is much 
more excusable, for he would not accept of the com- 
mission, till he had a promise from his captain, that he 
should not reside at the fort, nor visit it above once a 
week, or as he saw necessary. * 

Queen Aliquippa desired that her son, who is really 
a great warrior, might be taken into council, as he was 
declining and unfit for business, and that he should 
have an English name given him. I therefore called 
the Indians together by the advice of the Half-King, 
presented one of the medals, and desired him to wear 
it in remembrance of his great father, the King of Eng- 
land, and called him by the name of Colonel Fairfax, 
which he was told signified the first of the council. This 
gave him great pleasure. I was also informed, that an 
English name would please the Half-King, which made 
me presume to give him that of your Honor, and call him 
Dinwiddie ; interpreted in their language, the head of 
a//.f I am, &c. 

P. S. These deserters corroborate what the others 
said and we suspected. La Force's party were sent 

* Complaint was made against Captain Trent for being absent from his 
post when the French compelled his ensign to capitulate. 

Mr. Frazier had lived for some time in the Ohio country as an Indian 
trader. He had a house at the mouth of the Creek, ten miles up the 
Monongahela from the Fork of the Ohio River, and near the spot after-' 
terwards rendered memorable by Braddock's disastrous rencounter. Hence 
his stipulation, when he accepted the commission to act as lieutenant, not 
to be obliged to reside at the fort, then about to be constructed at the Fork 
of the River, nor to visit it except at stated times. 

f The Indians were likewise fond of giving names to the whites. 
Washington they named Connotaucarius. The governor of Pennsylvania 
was called Onas, the governor of Maryland Tocarryhogan, and the gover- 



48 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mi. 22. 

out as spies, and were to show that summons if discov- 
ered, or overpowered, by a superior party of ours. 
They say the commander was blamed for sending so 
small a party. 

Since writing the foregoing, Captain Mackay, with 
the Independent Company, has arrived, whom I take 
to be a very good sort of a gentleman. For want of 
proper instructions from your Honor, I am much at a 
loss to know how to act, or proceed in regard to his 
company. I made it my particular study to receive 
him (as it was your desire) with all the respect and 
politeness, that were due to his rank, or that I was 
capable of showing ; and I do not doubt from his appear- 
ance and behaviour, that a strict intimacy will ensue, 
when matters shall be put in a clear light. But at present, 
I assure you, they will rather impede the service, than 
forward it ; for, as they have commissions from the King, 
they look upon themselves as a distinct body, and will 
not incorporate and do duty with our men, but keep 
separate guards, and encamp separately. I have not 
offered to control Captain Mackay in any thing, nor 
showed that I claimed a superior command, except in 
giving the patrole and countersign, which must be the 
same in an army consisting of different nations, to dis- 
tinguish friends from foes. He knows the necessity of 
this, yet does not think he is to receive it from me. 
Then who is to give it '] Am I to issue these orders to 
a company 1 Or is an independent captain to prescribe 
rules to the Virginia regiment ? This is the question. 
But its absurdity is obvious. 

It now behoves you, Sir, to lay your absolute com- 
mands on one or the other to obey. This is indispen- 

nor of Virginia Jlssaragoa. These names pertained to the office, and not 
to the individual, each successive governor being designated by the same 
appellation. Giving a name was attended with much ceremony. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 49 

sably necessary, for nothing clashes more with reason, 
than to conceive our small bodies can act distinctly, 
without having connexion with one another, and yet be 
serviceable to the public. I do not doubt that Captain 
Mackay is an officer of sense, and I dare say will do the 
best for the service ; but, Sir, two commanders are so 
incompatible, that we cannot be as useful to one another, 
or the public, as we ought ; and I am sincerely sorry, 
that he has arrived before your instructions by Colonel 
Innes, who I doubt not will be fully authorized how to 
act. But as we have no news of Colonel Innes, I have, 
in the mean time, desired Major Carlyle to send this by 
an immediate express to you, who, I hope, will satisfy 
these doubts. 

Captain Mackay and I have lived in the most perfect 
harmony since his arrival, and have reasoned on this 
calmly ; and, I believe, if we should have occasion to 
exert our whole force, we shall do as well as divided 
authority can do. We have not had the least warmth 
of dispute. He thinks you have not a power to give 
commissions, that will command him. If so, I can very 
confidently say, that his absence would tend to the pub- 
lic advantage. I have been particularly careful in dis- 
covering no foolish desire of commanding him, neither 
have I intermeddled with his company in the least, nor 
given any directions concerning it, except, in general, 
the countersign, and place to repair to in case of an 
alarm, none of which he thinks he should receiveo I 
have testified to him, in the most serious manner, the 
pleasure I should take in consulting and advising with 
him upon all occasions, and I am satisfied that we shall 
never differ after you have decided this point. I am 
convinced, that your own just discernment and consider- 
ation will prove to you, that there can be no medium. 
The nature of the thing will not allow of it. Before

orders will be observed, it must be known who is to 
command ; and I am very confident you will see the 
absurdity, and consider the effects, of Captain Mackay's 
having the direction of the regiment ; for it would cer- 
tainly be the hardest thing in life, if we are to do double 
and treble duty, and neither be entitled to the pay nor 
rank of soldiers. That the first column of the Virginia 
regiment has done more for the interest of this expe- 
dition, than any company, or corps, that will hereafter 
arrive, must be obvious to all. This, Sir, Captain Mackay 
did not hesitate one moment to allow, since he has seen 
the work we have done upon the roads. We shall part 
to-morrow. I shall continue my march to Red-stone, 
while his company remains here. This, Sir, I found 
absolutely necessary for the public interest. Captain 
Mackay says, that it is not in his power to oblige his 
men to work on the road, unless he will engage them a 
shilling sterling a day, which I would not choose to do. 
And to suffer them to march at their ease, whilst our 
faithful soldiers are laboriously employed, carries with it 
an air of such distinction, that it is not to be wondered 
at, if the poor fellows were to declare the hardship of it. 
He also assures me, that this is not peculiar to his com- 
pany, but that no soldiers subject to martial law can be 
obliged to work for less. I shall continue to complete 
the work we have begun with my own men. We shall 
have the whole credit, as no others have assisted. 

I hope, from what has been said, your Honor will see 
the necessity of giving your speedy order on this head ; 
and I am sensible you will consider the evil tendency, 
that will accompany Captain Mackay's arrival. The 
rank of office to me, Sir, is much more important than 
the pay. 

Captain Mackay brought none of the cannon, very 
little ammunition, about five days' allowance of flour,

and sixty beeves. I am much grieved to find our stores 
so slowly advancing. God knows when we shall be 
able to do any thing to deserve better of our country. * 

I am, Sir, with the most sincere and unfeigned regard, 
your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant. 



TO WILLIAM FAIRFAX.t 

Alexandria, 11 August, 1754. 

SIR, 

Since my last to you, I have received, by Mr. Spilt- 
dorph, the letter therein alluded to, the contents of 
which are nearly the same as in the one received from 

* As intimated in this letter, Colonel Washington marched forward with 
the Virginia regiment, and left Captain Mackay with his company to guard 
Fort Necessity. Thus the difficulty ahout command was for the time re- 
moved. He advanced slowly as far as Gist's house, thirteen miles from 
the Great Meadows, employing the soldiers on the way in repairing the 
road, and sending out scouting parties to watch the motions of the French. 
In the mean time, he held councils with several Indian chiefs, who came to 
him for that purpose, delivered speeches, exchanged belts of wampum, and 
went through the usual ceremonies on such occasions. But all to little 
purpose, for some of the Indians were treacherous spies from the French, 
and others had no higher motive than that of obtaining presents of goods 
and provisions. In this mode of gaining friends, the French were much 
the most successful, as they were better supplied with all the articles 
wanted by the Indians. A party of men was likewise despatched to clear 
the road beyond Gist's house, towards the junction of Red-stone Creek 
with the Monongahela. 

While these operations were going on, reports were constantly brought 
in by French deserters and Indians, that large reinforcements had ar- 
rived at Fort Duquesne, and that a formidable force would soon come 
out to attack the English. On the 28th of June a council of war was held 
at Gist's house, in which it was unanimously resolved, that it was neces- 
sary to return to the fort, and wait there at all events till they should 
receive a larger supply of provisions. They retreated accordingly. The 
enemy appeared before the fort on the 3d of July, and the action of the 
Great Meadows was fought on that day. See APPENDIX, No. III.

and grandson of Thomas the fourth Lord Fairfax. His father died when

the Governor four days before. The following is an 
exact copy of it. 

"The Council met yesterday, and, considering the 
present state of our forces, and having reason to think 
the French will be reinforced next spring, it was re-

the Allegany mountains, either to dispossess the French 
of their fort, or build one in a proper place, that may be

now to order you to get your regiment completed to 
three hundred men, and I have no doubt, that you will 

he was young, and he was educated under the care of his uncle, Lord 
Lonsdale. At the age of twenty-one he entered the army, and served in 
Spain. He went also to the East Indies, and after his return engaged in 
the expedition against Providence Island, at that time in possession of 
the pirates. He was appointed governor of the Island, after its reduction, 
and married, in the year 1724, the daughter of Thomas Walker, a major 
in the army, who had accompanied the expedition, and received the ap- 
pointment of chief justice of the Bahama Islands. The climate not agree- 
ing with the health of Mr. Fairfax, he removed to New England, where 
he resided, holding an office of considerable trust and emolument, till he was 
desired by his kinsman, Lord Fairfax, to remove to Virginia, and become 
the agent for managing his large tract of lands in that colony. His first 
residence was in Westmoreland county, where he remained several years ; 
but he afterwards established himself at Belvoir, on the Potomac River, a 
little below Mount Vernon. He died at that place on the 3d of September, 
1757. He was a gentleman of great worth and respectability, held the 
offices of lieutenant of the county of Fairfax, and collector of the customs 
of South Potomac, and was one of the King's Council in Virginia, which last 
station he retained many years, and was for a considerable time president 
of the Council. 

From him have descended the various branches of the Fairfax family in 
Virginia. He was twice married ; first, to Sarah Walker, by whom he 
had four children, George William, Thomas, Anne, and Sarah ; secondly, 
to Deborah Clarke, of Salem, Massachusetts, by whom he had three chil- 
dren, Bryan, William, and Hannah. 

George William was educated in England. On his return to Virginia 
he married the daughter of Colonel Cary, of Hampton, became one of his 
Majesty's Council, and resided at Belvoir till the year 1773, when, some 
estates in Yorkshire, having devolved to him, he went to England. The 
political troubles, which followed, induced him to remain. Part of his

be able to enlist what you are deficient of your number 
very soon, and march directly to Will's Creek to join 
the other forces ; and, that there may be no delay, I 
order you to march what companies you have complete, 
and leave orders with the officers remaining to follow 
you, as soon as they shall have enlisted men sufficient 
to make up their companies. You know the season of 
the year calls for despatch. I depend upon your former 
usual diligence and spirit to encourage your people to 
be active on this occasion. Consult with Major Carlyle 
as to the ammunition which may be wanted, that I may 
send it up immediately. I trust much to your diligence 
and despatch in getting your regiment to Will's Creek 
as soon as possible. 

property in Virginia was sequestered, by which his income was reduced, 
and he removed to Bath, in England, where he lived in a private manner, 
and during the war contributed generously to the relief of the American 
prisoners. He died at Bath, on the 3d of April, 1787, in the sixty-third 
year of his age. Thomas, the second son, was an officer in the navy, and 
was killed in the East Indies, on board the ship of war, Harwich, in 
an action with the French squadron, 26 June, 1746. Anne, the eldest 
daughter of William Fairfax, was married to Lawrence Washington ; and, 
after the death of her husband, she was married a second time to George 
Lee of Virginia. Sarah, the second daughter, was married to John Carlyle, 
a merchant of Alexandria. Bryan, the third son, who afterwards became 
the eighth Lord Fairfax, married a daughter of Wilson Gary, and lived at 
a place called TowlstOn, in Fairfax county. He had two sons, Thomas 
and Ferdinando, and two daughters. As George William Fairfax, who 
died in England, had no children, he bequeathed his estates in Virginia to 
Ferdinando, this second son of his youngest and only surviving brother. 
William, the fourth son of William Fairfax, was educated in England 
He entered the army, and was killed at the famous siege of Quebec. 
He was a young man of much promise. It is related, that when General 
Wolfe had landed, he saw young Fairfax sitting near the bank of the river, 
and, touching him on the shoulder, said, " Young man, when we come to 
action remember your name." Hannah, the youngest child, was married 
to Warner Washington, cousin-german to General Washington. Bur- 
naby's Travels in America, 3d edition, p. 159. 

Mr. William Fairfax was an early, constant, and valuable friend to 
Washington, and it waa doubtless chiefly through the influence of Mr. 
Fairfax with the Governor and Council, that he received his appointment, 



54 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 22. 

" Colonel Innes will consult you in the appointment 
of officers for your regiment. Pray consider, if prac- 
ticable, that, to send a party of Indians to destroy the 
corn at the fort and Logstown would be of great service 
to us, and a considerable disappointment to the enemy. 
I can say no more, but to press the despatch of your 
regiment to Will's Creek." 

Thus, Sir, yt>u will see I am ordered, with the utmost 
despatch, to repair to Will's Creek with the regiment ; to 
do which, under the present circumstances, is as imprac- 
ticable, as it is (as far as I can see into the thing) to 
dispossess the French of their fort ; both of which, with 
our means, are morally impossible. 

The Governor observes, that, considering the state 
of our forces at present, it is thought advisable to move 
out immediately to dispossess the French. Now that 
very reason, "the state of our forces," is alone suf- 
ficient against the measure, without a large addition to 
them. Consider, I pray you, Sir, under what unhappy 
circumstances the men at present are ; and their num- 
bers, compared with those of the enemy, are so incon- 
siderable, that we should be harassed and driven from 
place to place at their pleasure. To what end the 
building of a fort would be, unless we could proceed 
as far as Red- stone, where we should have to take 

while yet a youth, as adjutant to the northern division of the Virginia mili- 
tia, and his mission to the French posts on the Ohio, as well as his subse- 
quent commission in the army. 

While Washington was encamped at the Great Meadows, Mr. Fairfax 
wrote to him ; " I will not doubt your having public prayers in the camp, 
especially when the Indian families are your guests, that they, seeing your 
plain manner of worship, may have their curiosity excited to be informed 
why we do not use the ceremonies of the French, which being well ex- 
plained to their understandings will more and more dispose them to receive 
our baptism, and unite in strict bonds of cordial friendship." 

It may be added, that it was Washington's custom to have prayers in 
the camp, while he was at Fort Necessity. 



PARTI.J THE FRENCH WAR. 55 

water, and where the enemy can come with their artil- 
lery, I cannot see, unless it be to secure a retreat, 
which we should have no occasion for, were we to go 
out in proper force and properly provided, which I aver 
cannot be done this fall ; for, before our force can be 
collected, with proper stores of provisions, ammunition, 
and working-tools, the season would approach in which 
horses cannot travel over the mountains on account of 
snows, want of forage, slipperiness of the roads, and 
high waters. Neither can men, unused to that life, live 
there, without some other defence from the weather than 
tents. Of this I am certain from my own knowledge, as 
I was out last winter from the 1 st of November till some 
time in January ; and notwithstanding I had a good tent, 
was as properly prepared, and as well guarded, in every 
respect, as I could be against the weather, yet the cold 
was so intense, that it was scarcely supportable. I 
believe, out of the five or six men that went with me, 
three of them, though they were as well clad as they 
could be, were rendered useless by the frost, and were 
obliged to be left upon the road. 

But the impossibility of supporting us with provisions 
is alone sufficient to discourage the attempt ; for, were 
commissaries with sufficient funds to set about procuring 
provisions, and getting them out, it is not probable that 
enough could be conveyed out this fall to support us 
through the winter ; for you are to consider, Sir, as 1 
before observed, that the snows and hard frosts set in 
very early upon those mountains ; and, as they are in 
many places almost inaccessible at all times, it is then 
more than horses can do to clamber up them. But, 
allow that they could, for want of provender they will 
become weak and die upon the road, as ours did, though 
we carried corn with us for their use, and purchased 
from place to place. This reason holds good, also, 



56 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^T. 22. 

against driving out live-stock, which, if it could be done, 
would save some thousands of loads for horses, that 
might be employed in carrying flour, which alone, not to 
mention ammunition and tools, we shall find will require 
more horses, than at this present moment can be pro- 
cured with our means. 

His Honor also asks, whether it is practicable to de- 
stroy the corn at the fort and at Logstown. At this 
question I am a little surprised, when it is known we 
must pass the French fort and the Ohio to get to Logs- 
town ; and how this can be done with inferior numbers, 
under our disadvantages, I see not; and, as to the 
ground for hoping, that we may engage a sufficient party 
of Indians for this .undertaking, I have no information, 
nor have I any conception ; for it is well known, that 
notwithstanding the expresses, whom the Indians sent to 
one another, and all the pains that Montour and Croghan 
(who, by vainly boasting of their interest with the In- 
dians, involved the country in great calamity, by causing 
dependence to be placed where there was none,) could 
take, they never could induce above thirty fighting men 
to join us, and not more than one half of those were 
serviceable upon any occasion. 

I could make many other remarks equally true and 
pertinent ; but to you, Sir, who, I am sensible, have 
acquired a pretty good knowledge of the country, and 
who see the difficulties that we labor under in getting 
proper necessaries, even at Winchester, it is needless. 
Therefore I shall only add some of the difficulties, which 
we are particularly subjected to in the Virginia regiment. 
And to begin, Sir, you are sensible of the sufferings our 
soldiers underwent in the last attempt, in a good season, 
to take possession of the Fork of the Allegany and Mo- 
nongahela. You also saw the disorders those sufferings 
produced among them at Winchester after they returned. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 57 

These are yet fresh in their memories, and have an irri- 
tating effect. Through the indiscretion of Mr. Spilt- 
dorph, they got some intimation that they were again 
ordered out, and it immediately occasioned a general 
clamor, and caused six men to desert last night. This, 
we expect, will be the consequence every night, unless 
prevented by close confinement. 

In the next place, I have orders to complete my 
regiment, and not a sixpence is sent for that purpose. 
Can it be imagined, that subjects fit for this service, 
who have been so much impressed with, and alarmed at, 
our want of provisions, which was a main objection to 
enlisting before, will more readily engage now without 
money, than they did before with it ? We were then 
from the 1st of February till the 1st of May, and could 
not complete our three hundred men by forty ; and the 
officers suffered so much by having their recruiting 
expenses withheld, that they have unanimously refused 
to engage in that duty again, unless they are repaid for 
the past, and a sufficient allowance is made to them in 
future. To show you the state of the regiment, I have 
sent you a report by which you will perceive what great 
deficiencies there are of men, arms, tents, kettles, screws 
(which was a fatal want before), bayonets, cartouch- 
boxes, and every thing else. Again, were our men ever 
so willing to go, for want of the proper necessaries of 
life they are unable to do it. The chief part are almost 
naked, and scarcely a man has either shoes, stockings, 
or a hat. These things the merchants will not credit 
them for. The country has made no provision ; they 
have not money themselves ; and it cannot be expected, 
that the officers will engage for them again, personally, 
having suffered greatly on this head already ; especially, 
now, when we have all the reason in the world to be- 
lieve, that they will desert whenever they have an

opportunity. There is not a man that has a blanket to 
secure him from cold or wet. Ammunition is a material 
article, and that is to come from Williamsburg, or wher- 
ever the governor can procure it. An account must 
be first sent of the quantity which is wanted; this, 
added to the carriage up, with the necessary tools, that 
must be had, as well as the time for bringing them 
round, will, I believe, advance us into that season, 
when it is usual, in more moderate climates, to retreat 
into winter-quarters, but here, with us, to begin a 
campaign ! * 

The promises of those traders, who offer to contract 
for large quantities of flour, are not to be depended upon; 

* It is hardly necessary to add, after the reasons so ably urged in this 
letter, that the wild project of a campaign over the Allegany Mountains, 
without money, men, or provisions, was abandoned. It is sufficiently ob- 
vious, that the Governor and Council were not practised in military affairs, 
and that they needed the advice of this young officer of twenty-two, whose 
wisdom and foresight so much exceeded his experience and his years. 
This letter is characterized by the same comprehensive grasp of mind, the 
same attention to details, and the same cool reflection, which marked his 
whole career in after life, and particularly his military transactions during 
the Revolution. 

There was a misunderstanding between the governor and the House 
of Burgesses, which prevented any appropriation of money at this juncture. 
It had been a custom in former times, that when the governor signed a 
patent for land, he should receive a fee of a pistole (about $3,60) for every 
such signature, which was a perquisite of his office. This fee had been 
revived by Governor Dinwiddie, but the House of Burgesses considered it 
an onerous exaction, and determined to resist it. As the governor refused 
to sign patents on any other terms, the Burgesses had the year before 
passed some spirited resolves, and sent an agent to England with a petition 
to the King's Council, that this custom might be abolished. The agent 
was Peyton Randolph, then Attorney-General of Virginia, and afterwards 
President of the first American Congress. While he was absent, the 
governor wrote to a correspondent in England ; "I have had a great 
deal of trouble and uneasiness from the factious disputes and violent heats 
of a most impudent troublesome party here, in regard to that silly fee of a 
pistole ; they are very full of the success of their agent, which I give small 
notice to." The Attorney-General returned, without effecting his whole 
object, but the Board of Trade made new regulations, by which relief was 
afforded in certain cases, and the fee was prohibited except where the

a most flagrant instance of which we experienced in 
Croghan, who was under obligation to Major Carlyle 
for the delivery of this article in a certain time, and who 
was an eyewitness to our wants ; yet he had the assur- 
ance, during our sufferings, to tantalize us, and boast of 
the quantity he could furnish, as he did of the number of 
horses he could command. Notwithstanding, we were 
equally disappointed of these also ; for out of two hun- 
dred he had contracted for, we never had above twenty- 
five employed in bringing the flour engaged for the 
camp ; and even this, small as the quantity was, did not 
arrive within a month of the time it was to have been 
delivered. 

Another thing worthy of consideration, is, that if we 
depend on Indian assistance, we must have a large 
quantity of proper Indian goods to reward their services, 
and make them presents! It is owing to this alone, that 
the French command such an influence among them, and 
that we have conciliated so few. This, with the scarcity 

quantity of land patented was more than one hundred acres. Journal of 
the House of Burgesses for JVbvem&er, 1753. 

The agent's expenses were two thousand five hundred pounds. The 
governor refused to sanction any bill for their payment. Piqued by this 
obstinacy, the House of Burgesses affixed the amount to a bill for raising 
twenty thousand pounds for his Majesty's service. Equally indignant at 
this presumption, the governor sent back the bill without his signature, 
and prorogued the Assembly for six weeks. Thus no supplies were 
granted, and the governor was induced to write, that " there appeared to 
him an infatuation in all the Assemblies in this part of the world." The 
treasurer of the colony had already paid the agent by order of the Assem- 
bly, without any special grant, which was no doubt a high disrespect to 
the Governor and Council. In giving an account of this affair to Governor 
Sharpe of Maryland, Governor Dinwiddie says, "I am now persuaded, that 
no expedition can be conducted here with dependence on American As- 
semblies ; and I have written to that purpose home, and proposed a British 
act of Parliament to compel the subjects here to obedience to his Majesty's 
commands, and to protect their property from the insults of the French." 
The governor seemed not aware, that the people who owned the property, 
and lived on the spot, were well qualified to judge for themselves how far 
it needed protection.

of provisions, would induce them to ask, when they 
were to join us, if we meant to starve them as well 
as ourselves. But I will have done, and only add 
assurances of the regard and affection with which I 
am, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 20 August, 1754. 

SIR, 

Mr. Peyrouny, soliciting for leave to attend the As- 
sembly, with the hope of having some allowance made 
for his loss of clothes and other articles, which he sus- 
tained in common with us all, and being not thoroughly 
cured of his wounds,* which have hitherto rendered 
him unfit for duty, I thought it proper to indulge him in 
this request. By him I again take the liberty of re- 
minding your Honor of the great necessity there is of a 
regulation in the soldiers' pay, and that a deduction be 
made for the country to furnish them with clothes; 
otherwise they never will be fit for service ; they are 
now naked, and cannot get credit even for a hat, and 
are teazing the officers every day to furnish them with 
these and other necessaries. 

Another thing, which should be fixed indisputably, is 
the law we are to be guided by, whether martial or 
military. If the former, I must beg the favor of your 
Honor to give me some written orders and indemnifica- 
tion ; otherwise I cannot give my assent (as I am liable 
for all proceedings) to any judgment of a court-martial, 
that touches the life of a soldier ; though at this time 
there is an absolute necessity for it, as the soldiers are

deserting constantly. Yesterday, while we were at 
church, twenty-five of them collected, and were going 
off in the face of their officers, but were stopped and im- 
prisoned before the plot came to its height. 

Colonel Innes did not fill up any commissions for the 
Virginia regiment, which has given those entitled to 
promotion some uneasiness. His reasons were, that it 
would be an unnecessary expense to the country, till 
there were orders to recruit ; but this, I think, should 
not have been considered, while it is remembered how 
small encouragement is shown them upon every occa- 
sion. Another motive, which, I believe, served to pre- 
vent it, was his dislike to the form of the commissions, 
as it savoured so much of the militia. He told me he 
would send down another form for your approbation, and 
Colonel Fairfax has also taken another, both of which 
are greatly preferable to those by which we act. And 
here I must beg leave to acquaint you, that the one you 
sent me is not signed. 

The officers are uneasy about their pay, and think it 
hard to be kept out of it so long. They hope you will 
order the dates of their commissions to be from the time 
of the vacancies that happened, of which I have enclosed 
a list for your information, hoping with them, that you 
will be kind enough to fill them up yourself, and return 
such commissions as were sent for precedents. 

Mr. West, lieutenant of Vanbraam's company, has 
resigned his commission, which I herewith send. I also 
enclose a list of medicines, which the doctor desires may 
be procured for the use of the regiment. He solicits 
much for an assistant, and I believe it necessary, as he 
often has more business than he can well manage, and, 
were a large detachment sent upon duty, it would be 
imprudent to go without the surgeon. 

If you should think proper to promote Mr. Peyrouny,

we shall be at a loss for a good disciplinarian to do adju- 
tant's duty, which requires a perfect knowledge of all 
the kinds of duty. I should, therefore, take it extremely 
kind, if you would be pleased to confer the office upon 
Mr. Frazier, whom I think I can fully answer for, let his 
former conduct have been what it may. 

We have caught two deserters, whom I shall keep 
imprisoned till I receive your answer how far the martial 
law may be extended. It is necessary that an example 
be made of some, as a warning to others; for there is 
scarcely a night, or an opportunity, when there are not 
desertions, and often two, three, or four at a time. We 
always advertise and pursue them as quickly as possible, 
but seldom to any purpose. The expenses attending 
this will fall heavily upon the country while this spirit 
prevails. I am, &,c.

Without date. 

SIR, 

As I wrote so lately and fully to you, by Mr. Poison, 
on the subject of the orders I had received, I have little 
to add now, only to acquaint your Honor, that as far as 
it is in my power, I shall endeavour to comply with 
them. What men we can, we do enlist ; but to send 
officers into different parts for that purpose, would be 
unavailing, as they neither have money, nor can get any. 
I have given Major Carlyle memorandums of several 
questions to ask your Honor, to which I beg your an- 
swers, that I may be governed thereby. I have also sent 
some of the soldiers' accounts, in hope of getting the 
money for them, as they are uneasy on that head. 
Others of them are rendered useless by their late 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 63 

wounds ; therefore I hope you will recommend it to the 
consideration of the Assembly, that some provision may 
be made to keep them from want. 

I have also desired Major Carlyle to mention to you 
the great necessity there is for regulation in the soldiers' 
pay ; and that a certain part may be deducted and ap- 
propriated for clothing. Unless this be done, we shall 
ever be in the distressed condition we are in at present, 
concerning which Major Carlyle can fully inform you. 
I refer you to him for many particulars, especially the 
consequences of going as high as Will's Creek, if we 
cannot march farther ; as, for the reasons which have 
been alleged, I fear we cannot, if we attempt it ; and, at 
that place, for want of proper conveniences, we could 
not remain. * I have the honor to be, &c. 



* After the battle of the Great Meadows, Colonel Innes was ordered to 
Will's Creek to construct a fort, which should serve as a rallying point to 
the remaining forces, and a guard to the frontiers. This was afterwards 
called Fort Cumberland. It was built chiefly by the three Independent 
Companies, namely, Captain Mackay's from South Carolina, and two others 
from New York, which were on their march from Alexandria to join Wash- 
ington at the time of the action at the Great Meadows. A company of 
recruits from Maryland also repaired to Will's Creek in November. Ten 
four-pounders, besides swivels, were mounted in the fort. But Colonel 
Innes was left with a small command ; for the North Carolina troops, to the 
number of three hundred and fifty, all disbanded themselves in a very dis- 
orderly manner at Winchester, and went off without ceremony. North 
Carolina had granted twelve thousand pounds, and enlisted soldiers at the 
extravagant rate of three shillings a day. The money was of course soon 
exhausted, and the troops, finding there was no pledge for future payment, 
very naturally consulted their own interest, and went home. 

This unmilitary conduct, and lack of patriotism, put an end to all hopes 
of further operations against the French for the present season, and added 
much to the despair of Governor Dinwiddie. He began to think the colo- 
nies would be ruined without remedy, and urged anew the measure, which 
he had before recommended to the British government It was his favo- 
rite scheme, that a poll-tax should be laid on all the colonies by an act 
of Parliament, and that the amount thus raised should be held at the 
King's disposal for the defence of the country. In a letter to the Board 
of Trade he expressed himself thus. " I beg leave to give my humble

TO COLONEL WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 






15 November, 1754.* 

DEAR SIR, 

I was favored with your letter from Rousby Hall, of 
the 4th instant. It demands my best acknowledgments 
for the particular marks of esteem you have expressed 
therein, and for the kind assurances of his Excellency 
Governor Sharpe's good wishes towards me. I also 
thank you, and sincerely, Sir, for your friendly intention 
of making my situation easy, if I return to the service ; 
and I do not doubt, could I submit to the terms, that 

opinion, that the progress of the French will never be effectually opposed, 
but by means of an act of Parliament to compel the colonies to contribute 
to the common cause independently of Assemblies, who in these parts are 
either ignorant, or do not foresee danger at a distance, or at least are so ob- 
stinate as to pay little regard to it." And, again, to the Secretary of State ; 
" I know of no method to compel them to their duty to the King, but by an 
act of Parliament for a general poll-tax of two shillings and sixpence a 
head from all the colonies on this continent." Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. 

Had this counsel of Governor Dinwiddie been followed, it would proba- 
bly have hastened the Revolution a few years, which, as it was, happened 
only twenty years afterwards. From the tenor of this correspondence, we 
may also learn what kind of intelligence and advice the government in 
England was in the habit of receiving from its governors, and may ac- 
count in some degree for the extraordinary delusion, that finally prevailed, 
respecting the character, temper, and feelings of the colonists. 

* At this time Colonel Washington had resigned his commission, and 
retired from the service. When the Assembly met in October, they 
granted twenty thousand pounds for the public exigencies, and the gov- 
ernor received from England ten thousand pounds sterling in specie, with 
the promise of ten thousand more, and two thousand firearms. There- 
upon he resolved to enlarge the army to ten companies, of one hundred 
men each, and to reduce them all to Independent Companies, by which 
there would be no officer in the Virginia regiment above the rank of a cap- 
tain. This expedient, he supposed, would remedy the difficulties about 
command. Washington accordingly resigned, as he would not accept a 
lower commission, than the one he had held, and under which he had ex- 
hibited a rare example of bravery and good conduct, that had gained him 
the applause of the country. 

Meantime Governor Sharpe, of Maryland, had received the King's com- 
mission as commander-in-chief of all the forces engaged against the 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 65 

I should be as happy under your command in the ab- 
sence of the General, as under any gentleman's whatever. 
But I think the disparity between the present offer of a 
company and my former rank too great, to expect any 
real satisfaction or enjoyment in a corps, where I once 
had, or thought I had, a right to command ; even if his 
Excellency had power to suspend the orders received 
in the Secretary of War's letter ; which, by the by, I 
am very far from thinking he has, or that he will attempt 
to do it, without fuller instructions than I believe he has 
received ; especially, too, as there has been a represen- 
tation of this matter by Governor Dinwiddie, and, I 
believe, the Assembly of this province. 

All that I presume the General can do, is, to prevent 
the different corps from interfering, which will occasion 
the duty to be done by corps, instead of detachments ; 
a very inconvenient way, as found by experience. * 

You make mention in your letter of my continuing in 

French. Colonel Fitzhugh was to have the command of the army, during 
General Sharpe's absence in visiting the military posts, and in executing 
his official duties as governor. Knowing the value of Colonel Washing- 
ton's experience and reputation, the commander-in-chief wished to bring 
him back to the service ; and, to effect this object, Colonel Fitzhugh wrote 
him a letter, in which he tried the force of argument and persuasion. 
" I am confident," he observes, " that the General has a very great regard 
for you, and will by every circumstance in his power make you very happy. 
For my part, I shall be extremely fond of your continuing in the service, 
and would advise you by no means to quit it. In regard to the Independent 
Companies, they will in no shape interfere with you, as you will hold your 
post during their continuance here, and, when the regiment is reduced, 
will have a separate duty." The letter, from which this extract is taken, 
Colonel Washington answered as above. 

* That is, the Independent and Colonial companies must always act 
separately, and not in concert by detachments from each. The incon- 
venience of this method was proved in the case of Captain Mackay, 
previously to the battle of the Great Meadows. Colonel Innes, at Will's 
Creek, contrived to keep up a nominal command, by acting under two 
commissions, his old one from the King received in the former war, and 
his new one from Governor Dinwiddie, to each of which he appealed as 
occasion required.

the service, and retaining my colonel's commission. 
This idea has filled me with surprise ; for, if you think 
me capable of holding a commission, that has neither 
rank nor emolument annexed to it, you must enter- 
tain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness, 
and believe me to be more empty than the commission 
itself. 

Besides, Sir, if I had time, I could enumerate many 
good reasons, that forbid all thoughts of my returning ; 
and which to you, or any other person, would, upon the 
strictest scrutiny, appear to be well founded. I must 
be reduced to a very low command, and subjected to 
that of many, who have acted as my inferior officers. 
In short, every captain, bearing the King's commission, 
every half-pay officer, or others appearing with such a 
commission, would rank before me. For these reasons 
I choose to submit to the loss of health, which I have, 
however, already sustained, (not to mention that of 
effects,) and the fatigue I have undergone in our first 
efforts, rather than subject myself to the same incon- 
veniences, and run the risk of a second disappointment, 

I shall have the consolation of knowing, that I have 
opened the way, when the smallness of our numbers 
exposed us to the attacks of a superior enemy ; that I 
have hitherto stood the heat and brunt of the day, and 
escaped untouched in time of extreme danger ; and that 
I have the thanks of my country, for the services I have 
rendered it.* 

The information I have received shall not sleep in 
silence, that those peremptory orders from home, which 
you say could not be dispensed with, for reducing the 
regiment into Independent Companies, were generated 
and hatched at Will's Creek. Ingenuous treatment and 

* See APPENDIX, No. III. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 67 

plain dealing I at least expected.* It is to be hoped 
the project will answer ; it shall meet with my acquies- 
cence in every thing except personal services. I here- 
with enclose Governor Sharpe's letter, which I beg you 
will return to him, with my acknowledgments for the 
favor he intended me. Assure him, Sir, as you truly 
may, of my reluctance to quit the service, and of the 
pleasure I should have received in attending his fortunes. 
Inform him, also, that it was to obey the call of honor, 
and the advice of my friends, that I declined it, and not 
to gratify any desire I had to leave the military line. 
My inclinations are strongly bent to arms. 

The length of this letter, and the small room I have 
left, tell me how necessary it is to conclude; which 
I will do, with the assurance that you shall always 
find me 

Truly and sincerely your most humble servant. 



* It would seem, that some unfair purpose was suspected in this matter 
of reducing the regiment, and thereby throwing out the higher officers. 
Nor was this a groundless suspicion. Governor Dinwiddie wrote to the 
Earl of Halifax, on the 25th of October ; " As there have been some dis- 
putes between the regulars, and the officers appointed by me, I am now 
determined to reduce our regiment into Independent Companies, so that 
from our forces there will be no other distinguished officer above a cap- 
tain." It is clear, therefore, that this was done at the governor's own 
motion, probably in concert with General Sharpe, and not by any orders, 
which had as yet been received from higher authority. He had written 
for instructions, but none had then arrived, nor in fact did they arrive, till 
brought out by General Braddock the winter following. It is no wonder, 
that a high-minded officer should be displeased at such a manoeuvre, 
cloaked as it was under the pretence of " peremptory orders from home." 
Doubtless the arrangement was considered essential to the prosperity of 
the service, but this would hardly be taken as an apology for a concealed 
design, by a man of spirit and high motives, who felt himself entitled to 
frankness and confidence.

TO ROBERT ORME. 

Mount Vernon, 15 March, 1755.* 

SIR, 

I was not favored with your polite letter, of the 2d 
instant, until yesterday ; acquainting me with the notice 
his Excellency, General Braddock, is pleased to honor 
me with, by kindly inviting me to become one of his 
family the ensuing campaign. It is true, Sir, I have, 
ever since I declined my late command, expressed an 
inclination to serve in this campaign as a volunteer ; and 
this inclination is not a little increased, since it is likely 

* General Braddock landed in Virginia, as commander-in-chief of all 
the military forces in North America, on the 20th of February. The 
transports with the British troops, who were to act under him, came into 
the Chesapeake soon afterwards. These he ordered up the Potomac to 
Alexandria, or, as it was then sometimes called, Bellhaven, where the 
troops debarked. Five companies were cantoned there. One company 
was stationed at Dumfries, six companies at Fredericksburg and Falmouth, 
three and a half companies at Winchester, and half a company at Conoco- 
cheague. In Maryland one company was cantoned at Bladensburg, 
another at Upper Marlborough, and two at Frederic Town. Some of the 
troops were landed below Alexandria, at the nearest point to Fredericks- 
burg. Meantime, the general remained at Williamsburg, planning with 
the governor preparations for the approaching campaign. 

The following order of the King, dated at St. James's, November 12th, 
1754, respecting the rank of colonial officers, was brought out by General 
Braddock. 

" All troops serving by commission signed by us, or by our general com- 
manding in chief in North America, shall take rank before all troops, 
which may serve by commission from any of the governors, lieutenant or 
deputy governors, or president for the time being. And it is our further 
pleasure, that the general and field officers of the provincial troops shall 
have no rank with the general and field officers, who serve by commission 
from us ; but that all captains and other inferior officers of our forces, who 
are or may be employed in North America, are, on all detachments, courts- 
martial, and other duty, wherein they may be joined with officers serving 
by commission from the governors, lieutenant or deputy governors, or 
president for the time being of the said provinces, to command and take 
post of the said provincial officers of the like rank, though the commissions 
of the said provincial officers of li&e rank should be of elder date." 

Since his resignation in October, Colonel Washington had remained 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 69 

to be conducted by a gentleman of the General's expe- 
rience. 

But, besides this, and the laudable desire I may have 
to serve, with my best abilities, my King and country, 
I must be ingenuous enough to confess, that I am not a 
little biassed by selfish considerations. To explain, Sir, 
I wish earnestly to attain some knowledge in the mili- 
tary profession, and, believing a more favorable oppor- 
tunity cannot offer, than to serve under a gentleman of 
General Braddock's abilities and experience, it does, 
you may reasonably suppose, not a little contribute to 
influence my choice. But, Sir, as I have taken the 
liberty to express my sentiments so freely, I must beg 
your indulgence while I add, that the only bar, which 
can check me in the pursuit of this object, is the incon- 
veniences that must necessarily result from some pro- 
ceedings, which happened a little before the General's 
arrival, and which, in some measure, had abated the 
ardor of my desires, and determined me to lead a life 



inactive at Mount Vernon, and if he found it derogatory to his honor to 
hold a commission under Governor Dinwiddie's scheme of Independent 
Companies, it could not be expected, that he would subject himself to the 
humiliating terms of this order from the King. His passion for a military 
life, however, had not abated. General Braddock, knowing his value, and 
the importance of securing his services to the expedition, directed Mr. Orme, 
his aid-de-camp, to write to him the following letter, proposing an expe- 
dient by which the chief obstacles would be removed. 

" Williamsburg, 2 March, 1755. 
" SIR, 

" The General, having been informed that you expressed some desire to 
make the campaign, but that you declined it upon some disagreeableness 
that you thought might arise from the regulations of command, has ordered 
me to acquaint you, that he will be very glad of your company hi his family, 
by which all inconveniences of that kind will be obviated. 

" I shall think myself very happy to form an acquaintance with a person 
so universally esteemed, and shall use every opportunity of assuring you 
how much I am, Sir, your most obedient servant

of retirement, into which I was just entering, at no small 
expense, when your favor was presented to me. 

But, as I shall do myself the honor of waiting upon 
his Excellency, as soon as I hear of his arrival at Alex- 
andria, (I would do it sooner, were I certain where to 
find him,) I shall decline saying any thing further on 
this head till then; begging you will be pleased to 
assure him, that I shall always retain a grateful sense of 
the favor with which he is pleased to honor me, and 
that I should have embraced this opportunity of writing 
to him, had I not recently addressed a congratulatory 
letter to him on his safe arrival in this country. 

I flatter myself you will favor me in making a com- 
munication of these sentiments. 

You do me a singular favor, in proposing an acquaint- 
ance. It cannot but be attended with the most flattering 
prospects, on my part, as you may already perceive, by 
the familiarity and freedom with which I now enter 
upon this correspondence ; a freedom, which, even if it 
is disagreeable, you must excuse, and lay the blame of 
it at your own door, for encouraging me to throw off that 
restraint, which otherwise might have been more ob- 
vious in my deportment on such an occasion. 

The hope of shortly seeing you will be an excuse for 
my not adding more, than that I shall endeavour to 
approve myself worthy of your friendship, and that I 
beg to be esteemed your most obedient servant. 



TO ROBERT ORME. 



Mount Vernon, 2 April, 1755. 

DEAR SIR, 

The arrival of a good deal of company (among whom 
is my mother, alarmed at the report of my intention to

attend your fortunes,) deprives me of the pleasure of 
waiting upon you to-day, as I had designed.* I therefore 
beg, that you will be kind enough to make my compli- 
ments and excuse to the General, who I hope to hear 
is greatly recovered from his indisposition, and recruited 
sufficiently to prosecute his journey to Annapolis, t 

I find myself much embarrassed with my affairs, hav- 
ing no person in whom I can confide, to entrust the 
management of them with. Notwithstanding, I am de- 
termined to do myself the honor of accompanying you, 
upon this proviso, that the General will be kind enough 
to permit my return, as soon as the active part of the 
campaign is at an end, if it is desired ; or, if there should 
be a space of inaction, long enough to admit a visit to 
my home, that I may be indulged in coming to it. 

I need not add, how much I should be obliged by 
joining you at Will's Creek, instead of doing it at an 
earlier period, t 

These things, Sir, in whatever light they may appear 

* Captain Orme was now with the army at Alexandria, nine miles from 
Mount Vernon. 

f Soon after General Braddock arrived in Virginia, he wrote to the 
governors of Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania, requesting them 
to meet him at Annapolis in Maryland, to concert measures for future 
operations. The General and Governor Dinwiddie proceeded to Anna- 
polis, but the place of meeting was afterwards changed to Alexandria, 
where they all assembled on the 13th of April, and concerted measures for 
the united action of the middle and northern colonies. It was thought by 
some, that New York ought to be the centre of operations, as affording 
greater facilities for attacking the French at their strongest points ; but 
Braddock's instructions were positive to proceed to the Ohio. He marched 
from Alexandria on the 20th of April. 

f In reply Captain Orme wrote ; "The General orders me to give you 
his compliments, and to assure you his wishes are to make it agreeable to 
yourself and consistent with your affairs, and, therefore, he desires you 
will so settle your business at home, as to join him at Will's Creek if more 
convenient to you ; and, whenever you find it necessary to return, he begs 
you will look upon yourself as entirely master, and judge what is proper to 
be done."

to you at first sight, will not, I hope, be thought unrea- 
sonable, when it is considered how unprepared I am to 
quit a family, and an estate I was just about to settle, 
which is in the utmost confusion. 

I enclose a letter from Colonel Fairfax to Governor 
Shirley, which, with his compliments, he desired might 
be given to that gentleman. He also sends his blessing 
to you. At present he entertains sanguine hopes of you ; 
this for your comfort. 

I herewith send you a small map of the back country, 
which, though imperfect and roughly drawn, for want 
of proper instruments, may give you a better knowl- 
edge of the designated parts, than you have hitherto 
had an opportunity of acquiring. 

I shall do myself the honor of waiting upon the Gen- 
eral, as soon as I hear of his return from Annapolis. 
My compliments attend him, and Mr. Shirley. I am,

OF DELEGATES, VIRGINIA. 



Mount Vernon, 20 April, 1755. 

DEAR SIR, 

I little expected, when I wrote you last, that I should 
so soon engage in another campaign ; but, in doing it, I 
may be allowed to claim some merit, if it is considered 
that the sole motive, which invites me to the field, is the 
laudable desire of serving my country, not the gratifica- 
tion of any ambitious or lucrative plans. This, I flatter 
myself, will manifestly appear by my going as a volun- 
teer, without expectation of reward, or prospect of 
obtaining a command, as I am confidently assured it is 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 73 

not in General Braddock's power to give me a commis- 
sion that I would accept. Perhaps by many others the 
above declaration might be construed into self-applause, 
which, unwilling to lose, I proclaim myself. But by you, 
Sir, I expect it will be viewed in a different light, be- 
cause you have sympathized in my disappointments, 
and lent your friendly aid to reinstate me in a suit- 
able command ; the recollection of which can never be 
lost upon a mind, that is not insensible of obligations, 
but always ready to acknowledge them. 

This is the reason why I am so much more unre- 
served in the expression of my sentiments to you, than 
I should be to the world, whose censures and criticisms 
often place good designs in a bad light. But, to be 
ingenuous, I must confess I have other intentions in 
writing you this letter ; for, if there is any merit in my 
case, I am unwilling to hazard it among my friends, 
without this exposition of facts, as they might conceive 
that some advantageous offers had engaged my services, 
when, in reality, it is otherwise, for I expect to be a 
considerable loser in my private affairs by going. It is 
true I have been importuned to make this campaign by 
General Braddock, as a member of his family, he con- 
ceiving, I suppose, that the small knowledge I have had 
an opportunity of acquiring of the country, Indians, &c., 
is worthy of his notice, and may be useful to him in the 
progress of the expedition. 

I heartily wish a happy issue to all your resolves, and 
am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant

TO WILLIAM FAIRFAX. 

Mount Vernon, 23 April, 1755. 

DEAR SIR 

I cannot think of quitting Fairfax, * without embracing 
this last opportunity of bidding you farewell. I shall 
this day set out for Will's Creek, where I expect to 
meet the General, and to stay, I fear, too long, as the 
march must be regulated by the slow movements of the 
train ; which, I am sorry to say, will be tedious, very 
tedious indeed, as I have long predicted, though few 
believed. Alexandria has been honored with five gov- 
ernors hi consultation ; a favorable presage, I hope, not 
only of the success of this expedition, but of the future 
greatness of that town ; for surely such a meeting must 
have been occasioned by the commodious and pleasant 
situation of the place, which prognosticates population, 
and increase of a flourishing trade. 

I have had the honor to be introduced to several gov- 
ernors, and of being well received by them ; especially 
Mr. Shirley, whose character and appearance have per- 
fectly charmed me. I think his every word and action 
discover in him the gentleman and politician. I heartily 
wish the same unanimity may prevail among us, as 
appeared to exist between him and his Assembly, 
when they, to expedite the business, and to forward his 
journey hither, sat till eleven and twelve o'clock every 
night. 

It will be needless, as I know your punctuality re- 
quires no stimulus, to remind you of an affair, about 
which I wrote some time ago ; therefore I shall only beg 
my compliments to Mr. Nicholas and his lady, and to 
all friends who think me worthy of their inquiries. I 
am, &,c.

Winchester, 5 May, 1755. 

DEAR SIR, 

I overtook the General at Frederic Town, in Mary- 
land. Thence we proceeded to this place, where we 
shall remain till the arrival of the second division of the 
train, which we hear left Alexandria on Tuesday last. 
After that, we shall continue our march to Will's Creek; 
from whence, it is imagined, we shall not stir till the 
latter end of this month, for want of wagons and other 
conveniences of transport over the mountains. 

You will naturally conclude, that to pass through 
Maryland, when no object required it, was an uncom- 
mon, and an extraordinary route for the General and for 
Colonel Dunbar's regiment to .this place. The reason, 
however, was obvious. Those who promoted it had 
rather the communication should be opened that way, 
than through Virginia; but I believe the eyes of the 
General are now opened, and the imposition detected ; 
consequently, the like will not happen again. I am, &c.

Major Carlyle, who, I hope, will contrive to forward 
them, as quickly as my necessity requires. 

I see no prospect of moving from this place soon, as 
we have neither horses nor wagons enough, and no for- 
age, except what is expected from Philadelphia ; there- 
fore, I am well convinced, that the trouble and difficulty 
we must encounter in passing the mountains, for the 
want of proper conveniences, will equal all the difficul- 
ties of the campaign ; for I conceive the march of such 
a train of artillery, in these roads, to be a tremendous 
undertaking. As to any danger from the enemy, I look 
upon it as trifling, for I believe the French will be 
obliged to exert their utmost force to repel the attacks 
to the northward, where Governor Shirley and others, 
with a body of eight thousand men, will annoy their set- 
tlements, and attempt their forts. 

The General has appointed me one of his aids-de- 
camp,* in which character I shall serve this campaign 
agreeably enough, as I am thereby freed from all com- 
mands but his, and give his orders, which must be 
implicitly obeyed. 

I have now a good opportunity, and shall not neglect 
it, of forming an acquaintance, which may be serviceable 
hereafter, if I find it worth while to push my fortune in 
the military line. 

I have written to my two female correspondents by 
this opportunity, one of whose letters I have enclosed 
to you, and beg your deliverance of it. I shall expect 
a particular account of all that has happened since my 
departure.

TO WILLIAM FAIRFAX. 

Camp, at Will's Creek, 7 June, 1755. 

SIR, 

I arrived with my charge safe in camp, on the 30th 
of last month, after waiting a day and part of another in 
Winchester, expecting the cavalry to escort me up ; in 
which being disappointed, I was obliged to make use 
of a small guard of the militia of Frederick county. * 

The General, from frequent breaches of contract, has 
lost all patience ; and, for want of that temper and 
moderation, which should be used by a man of sense 
upon these occasions, will, I fear, represent us hi a light 
we little deserve ; for, instead of blaming the individuals, 
as he ought, he charges all his disappointments to pub- 
lic supineness, and looks upon the country, I believe, as 
void of honor and honesty. We have frequent disputes 
on this head, which are maintained with warmth on both 
sides, especially on his, as he is incapable of arguing 
without it, or giving up any point he asserts, be it ever 
so incompatible with reason or common sense, t 

* Colonel Washington had been despatched to Williamsburg, to obtain 
four thousand pounds in money for the use of the army, and bring it to the 
camp at Will's Creek. He executed this commission with promptness and 
effect, and the guard here mentioned was to protect him with this charge 
on his return between Winchester and the camp. 

f General Braddock had good grounds for complaint, if we may judge 
from his letters published in the French M6moire, as translations from the 
originals found among his papers taken at his defeat, which bear every 
mark of being genuine. The contractors deceived and disappointed him 
in nearly every instance, and paralyzed his most strenuous efforts to pro- 
ceed with the army. This, to be sure, was not the fault of the country, 
but it would seem to have been the duty of the adjoining colonies to take 
care, that supplies were promptly forwarded through some channel or 
other, and not to leave thfe expedition at the mercy of faithless and pecu- 
lating contractors. It is evident, that the sense of the people was but little 
wakened to the necessity, or importance, of these enterprises against the 
French, and that they looked upon them rather as the results of political

A line of communication is to be opened from Penn- 
sylvania to the French fort Duquesne, along which, 
after a little time, we are to receive all our convoys of 
provisions, and to give all possible encouragement to a 
people, who ought rather to be chastised for their insen- 
sibility to danger, and disregard of their sovereign's 
expectations. They, it seems, are to be the favored 
people, because they have furnished what their absolute 
interest alone induced them to do, that is, one hundred 
and fifty wagons, and an equivalent number of horses. * 

Major Chapman, with a detachment of five hundred 
men, and the Quartermaster- General, marched two or 

objects in Great Britain, than as immediately concerning themselves. 
The perpetual broils with their governors, also, had created a willingness 
to thwart any schemes proposed by these staunch and obstinate defenders 
of the prerogative and of prescriptive abuses. 

* These remarks are applied to the Pennsylvanians, who were singu- 
larly backward in rendering any aids for the public service. The merit 
of procuring the wagons and horses, here mentioned, was wholly due to 
Franklin, and not to any agency or intention of the Assembly. Being at 
that time postmaster-general in the colonies, he visited General Braddock 
at Frederic Town, for the purpose of maturing a plan for transmitting des- 
patches between the general and the governors. Becoming acquainted 
with the obstacles, which opposed the progress of the army, he stipulated 
with General Braddock to furnish within a given time one hundred and 
fifty wagons, and a proportionable number of horses, for which a specified 
sum was to be allowed. He immediately returned to York and Lancaster, 
sent out an advertisement among the farmers, and in two weeks all the 
wagons and horses were in readiness at Will's Creek. He gave his 
personal security, that the compensation agreed on should be duly paid 
according to contract. 

General Braddock was fully aware of the nature and value of this ser- 
vice. On the 5th of June he wrote from Will's Creek to the Secretary of 
State as follows. 

" Before I left Williamsburg, the Quartermaster-General told me, that 
I might depend upon twenty-five hundred horses, and two hundred wagons 
from Virginia and Maryland ; but I had great reason to doubt it, having 
experienced the false dealings of all in this country, with whom I had been 
concerned. Hence, before my departure from Frederic I agreed with 
Mr. Benjamin Franklin, postmaster in Pennsylvania, who has great credit 
in that province, to hire one hundred and fifty wagons, and the necessary 
number of horses. This he accomplished with promptitude and fidelity,

three days before I arrived here, to open the roads, and 
lay in a deposite of provisions at a small fort, which they 
are to erect at the Little Meadows. 

To-morrow, Sir Peter Halket, with the first brigade, 
is to begin his march, and on Monday the General, with 
the second, is to follow. One hospital is filled with 
sick, and the numbers increase daily, with the bloody 
flux, which has not yet proved mortal to many. 

By a letter received from Governor Morris, of Penn- 
sylvania, we have advice, that a party of three hundred 
men passed Oswego on their way to Fort Duquesne, 
and that another and a larger detachment was expected 
to pass that place every moment. By the public ac- 
counts from Pennsylvania, we are farther assured, that 
nine hundred men have certainly passed Oswego to 
reinforce the French on the Ohio ; so that from these 
accounts we have reason to believe, that we shall have 
more to do than to go up the hills and come down. 

We are impatient to hear what the powers at home 
are doing ; whether peace, or war, is likely to be the 
issue of all these preparations.

Your most obedient servant. 



and it is almost the only instance of address and integrity, which I have 
seen in all these provinces." M6moire, &c. p. 198. 

When Franklin returned to Philadelphia, the House of Assembly was in 
session, and unanimously passed a vote of thanks " to Benjamin Franklin, 
a member of this House, for the great services done to the King's forces, 
and to this province, in his late journey through Maryland and our back 
counties." It should be added, also, that no profit on his own account 
was either expected or received. On the contrary, after General Brad- 
dock's death, the owners of the wagons and horses came upon Franklin 
for their pay, amounting in all to nearly twenty thousand pounds ; and he 
was much embarrassed with these claims, till they were finally allowed 
and settled by General Shirley, who succeeded Braddock in the command.

TO JOHN A. WASHINGTON. 

Ybughiogany, 28 June, 1755. 

DEAR BROTHER, 

Immediately upon our leaving the camp at George's 
Creek, on the 1 4th instant, from whence I wrote to you, 
I was seized with a violent fever and pain of the head, 
which continued without intermission until the 23d, 
when I was relieved, by the General's absolutely order- 
ing the physician to give me Dr. James's powders, one 
of the most excellent medicines in the world. It gave 
me immediate ease, and removed my fever and other 
complaints in four days' time. My illness was too vio- 
lent to suffer me to ride ; therefore I was indebted to a 
covered wagon for some part of my transportation ; but 
even in this, I could not continue far. The jolting was 
so great, that I was left upon the road with a guard, 
and some necessaries, to wait the arrival of Colonel 
Dunbar's detachment, which was two days' march be- 
hind us, the General giving me his word of honor, that I 
should be brought up, before he reached the French 
fort. This promise, and the doctor's declaration, that, if 
I persevered in my attempts to go on, in the condition I 
then was, my life would be endangered, determined me 
to halt for the above mentioned detachment. 

As the communication between this and Will's Creek 
must soon be too dangerous for single persons to pass, 
it will render the intercourse of letters slow and preca- 
rious ; therefore I shall attempt (and will go through it 
if I have strength) to give you an account of our proceed- 
ings, our situation, and prospects at present ; which I 
desire you will communicate to Colonel Fairfax, and 
others, my correspondents, for I am too weak to write 
more than this letter. 

In the letter, which I wrote to you from George's 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 81 

Creek, I acquainted you, that, unless the number of 
wagons was retrenched, and the carriage-horses in- 
creased, we should never be able to see Fort Duquesne.* 
This, in two days afterwards (which was about the time 
they got to the Little Meadows, with some of their fore- 
most wagons, and strongest teams), they themselves 
were convinced of; for they found, that, besides the 
extreme difficulty of getting the wagons along at all, 
they had often a line of three or four miles in length ; 
and the soldiers guarding them were so dispersed, that, 
if we had been attacked either in front, centre, or rear, 
the part so attacked must have been cut off, or totally 
routed, before they could be sustained by any other 
corps. 

At the Little Meadows a second council was called 
(for there had been one before), wherein the urgency 
for horses was again represented to the officers of the 
different corps, and how laudable a farther retrench- 
ment of their baggage would be, that the spare ones 
might be turned over for the public service. In order 
to encourage this, I gave up my best horse, which I 
have never heard of since, and took no more baggage 
than half my portmanteau would easily contain. It is 
said, however, that the number reduced by this second 
attempt was only from two hundred and ten or twelve, 
to two hundred, which had no perceivable effect. 

The General, before they met in council, asked my 
private opinion concerning the expedition. I urged him, 
in the warmest terms I was able, to push forward, if he 
even did it with a small but chosen band, with such 

* In the letter here referred to he says ; " The difficulties arising 1 in 
our march, from having such a number of wagons, will, I fear, prove an 
insurmountable obstacle, unless some scheme can be fallen upon to re-- 
trench the wagons, and increase the number of bat-horses, which is what 
I recommended at first, and which I believe is now found to be the best 
means of transporting our provisions and stores to the Ohio."

artillery and light stores as were necessary ; leaving the 
heavy artillery, baggage, and the like with the rear division 
of the army, to follow by slow and easy marches, which 
they might do safely, while we were advanced in front. 
As one reason to support this opinion, I urged, that, if 
we could credit our intelligence, the French were weak 
at the Fork at present, but hourly expected reinforce- 
ments, which, to my certain knowledge, could not arrive 
with provisions, or any supplies, during the continuance 
of the drought, as the Buffalo River (Riviere aux Boeufs), 
down which was their only communication to Venango, 
must be as dry as we now found the Great Crossing of 
the Youghiogany, which may be passed dry-shod. 

This advice prevailed, and it was determined, that 
the General, with one thousand two hundred chosen 
men, and officers from all the different corps, under the 
following field officers, viz. ; Sir Peter Halket, who acts 
as brigadier ; Lieutenant- Colonel Gage, Lieutenant- 
Colonel Burton, and Major Sparks, with such a num- 
ber of wagons as the train would absolutely require, 
should march as soon as things could be got in readi- 
ness. This was completed, and we were on our march, 
by the 19th, leaving Colonel Dunbar and Major Chap- 
man behind, with the residue of the two regiments, some 
Independent Companies, most of the women, and, in 
short, every thing not absolutely essential, carrying our 
provisions and other necessaries upon horses. 

We set out with less than thirty carriages, including 
those that transported the ammunition for the howitzers, 
twelve-pounders, and six-pounders, and all of them 
strongly horsed ; which was a prospect that conveyed 
infinite delight to my mind, though I was excessively ill 
at the time. But this prospect was soon clouded, and 
my hopes brought very low indeed, w r hen I found, that, 
instead of pushing on with vigor, without regarding a

little rough road, they were halting to level every mole- 
hill, and to erect bridges over every brook, by which 
means we were four days in getting twelve miles. 

At this camp I was left by the Doctor's advice, and 
the General's positive orders, as I have already men- 
tioned, without which I should not have been prevailed 
upon to remain behind ; as I then imagined, and now 
believe, I shall find it no easy matter to join my own 
corps again, which is twenty-five miles in advance. 
Notwithstanding, I had the General's word of honor, 
pledged in the most solemn manner, that I should 
be brought up before he arrived at Fort Duquesne.* 
They have had frequent alarms, and several men have 
been scalped ; but this is done with no other design, 
than to retard the march, and to harass the men, who, 
if they are to be turned out every time a small party 
attacks the guards at night (for I am certain they have 
not sufficient force to make a serious assault), the ene- 
my's aim will be accomplished by the gaining of time. 

I have been now six days with Colonel Dunbar's 
corps, who are in a miserable condition for want of 
horses, not having enough for their wagons ; so that the 
only method he has of proceeding, is to march with as 
many wagons as these will draw, and then halt till the 
remainder are brought up with the same horses, which 
requires two days more ; and shortly, I believe, he will 
not be able to stir at all. There has been vile manage- 
ment in regard to horses. 

* Captain Roger Morris, one of the General's aids-de-camp, wrote to 
Colonel Washington from the Great Crossing of the Youghiogany in the 
following language. " I am desired by the General to let you know, that 
he marches to-morrow and next day, but that he shall halt at the Meadows 
two or three days It is the desire of every individual in the family, and 
the General's positive commands to you, not to stir, but by the advice of 
the person under whose care you are, till you are better, which we all hope 
will be very soon." 



84 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 23. 

My strength will not admit of my saying more, though 
I have not said half that I intended concerning our 
affairs here. Business I shall not think of, but depend 
solely upon your management of all my affairs, not 
doubting that they will be well conducted. I am, &c. 

July 2d. A serious inconvenience attended me in 
my sickness, and that was losing the use of my servant ; 
for poor John Alton was taken about the same time that 
I was, and with nearly the same disorder, and was con- 
fined as long ; so that we did not see each other for 
several days. He is also tolerably well recovered. 

We are advanced almost as far as the Great Meadows, 
and I shall set out to-morrow morning for my own corps, 
with an escort of one hundred men, who are to guard 
some provisions up, so that my fears and doubts on that 
head are now removed. 

I had a letter yesterday from Orme, who writes me 
word, that they have passed the Youghiogany for the 
last time ; that they have sent out parties to scour the 
country thereabouts, and have reason to believe the 
French are greatly alarmed at their approach. 



TO ROBERT ORME. 

Great Crossing, 30 June, 1755. 

DEAR ORME, 

I came to this camp on Thursday last, with the rear 
of Colonel Dunbar's detachment, and should have con- 
tinued on with his front to-day, but was prevented by 
rain.

minating. Then I shall have nothing to encounter but 
weakness, which is excessive, and the difficulty of get-

ting to you, arising therefrom ; but this I would not miss 
doing, before you reach Duquesne, for five hundred 
pounds. However, I have no doubt now of doing it, as 
I am moving on, and the General has given me his word 
of honor, in the most solemn manner, that it shall be 
effected. 

As the Doctor thinks it imprudent for me to use much 
exercise for two or three days, my movements will be 
retarded. I should be glad, therefore, to be advised of 
your marches from Gist's, and how you are likely to 
proceed, for you may rest assured, that Colonel Dunbar 
cannot remove from this present encampment in less 
than two or three days ; and I believe, really, it will be 
as much as he possibly can do to reach the Meadows at 
all, so that you will be greatly in advance of him. 

I am too weak to add more, than my compliments to 
the General and the family, and again to desire, that you 
will oblige me in the above request, and devise the most 
effectual means for me to join you. I am, dear Orme, 
your most obedient servant.* 

* This letter and the preceding are the last on record, previous to the 
battle of the Monongahela. The following memorandum, written at a 
later date, is entered in the Letter-Book. 

"On the 8th of July I rejoined (in a covered wagon) the advanced 
division of the army, under the immediate command of the General. On 
the 9th I attended him on horseback, though very low and weak. This 
day he was attacked and defeated by a party of French and Indians. 
When all hope of rallying the dismayed troops, and recovering the ground, 
had expired, our provisions and stores being given up, I was ordered to 
Dunbar's camp." 

Colonel Dunbar had advanced seven miles beyond the. Great Meadows, 
which was the position of his camp at the time of the action. Here he 
remained till he was met by General Braddock, and his flying troops, after 
the defeat at the Monongahela, when he speedily retreated with the 
whole army to Fort Cumberland.

TO GOVERNOR INNES, AT FORT CUMBERLAND.* 

Little Meadows, 15 July, 1755. 

SIR, 

Captain Orme, being confined to his litter, and not 
able to write, has desired me to acknowledge the receipt 
of yours. He begs the favor of you to have the room 
the General lodged in prepared for Colonel Burton, him- 
self, and Captain Morris, who are all wounded ; also, 
that some small place may be had convenient for cook- 
ing ; and, if any fresh provision, and other necessaries 
for persons in their condition, may be had, that you will 
engage them. 

The horses, which carry the wounded gentlemen in 
litters, are so much fatigued, that we dread their per- 
formance ; therefore, it is desired that you will be kind 
enough to send out eight or ten fresh horses for their 
relief, which will enable us to reach the fort this evening. 

I doubt not but you have had an account of the poor 
gentlemen's death by some of the affrighted wagoners, 
who ran off, without taking leave. I am, Sir, your most 
obedient servant.

pened, within ten miles of the French fort, on Wednes- 
day the 9th instant. 

We marched to that place, without any considerable 
loss, having only now and then a straggler picked up by 
the French and scouting Indians. When we came there, 
we were attacked by a party of French and Indians, 
whose number, I am persuaded, did not exceed three hun- 
dred men;* while ours consisted of about one thousand 
three hundred well-armed troops, chiefly regular soldiers, 
who were struck with such a panic, that they behaved 
with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive. The 
officers behaved gallantly, in order to encourage their 
men, for which they suffered greatly, there being near 
sixty killed and wounded; a large proportion of the 
number we had. 

The Virginia troops showed a good deal of bravery, 
and were nearly all killed ; for I believe, out of three 
companies that were there, scarcely thirty men are left 
alive. Captain Peyrouny, and all his officers down to a 
corporal, were killed. Captain Poison had nearly as 
hard a fate, for only one of his was left, f In short, the 
dastardly behaviour of those they call regulars exposed 
all others, that were inclined to do their duty, to almost 
certain death ; and, at last, in despite of all the efforts 
of the officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pur- 
sued by dogs, and it was impossible to rally them. J

The General was wounded, of which he died three 
days after. Sir Peter Halket was killed in the field, 
where died many other brave officers. I luckily escaped 
without a wound, though I had four 'bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me. Captains Orme 
and Morris, two of the aids-de-camp, were wounded 
early in the engagement, which rendered the duty 
harder upon me, as I was the only person then left to 
distribute the General's orders, which I was scarcely 
able to do, as I was not half recovered from a violent ill- 
ness, that had confined me to my bed and a wagon for 
above ten days. I am still in a weak and feeble con- 
dition, which induces me to halt here two or three days 
in the hope of recovering a little strength, to enable me 
to proceed homewards ; from whence, I fear, I shall not 
be able to stir till towards September ; so that I shall 
not have the pleasure of seeing you till then, unless it 
be in Fairfax. Please to give my love to Mr. Lewis 
and my sister; and compliments to Mr. Jackson, and 
all other friends that inquire after me. I am, honored 
Madam, your most dutiful son. 



TO JOHN A. WASHINGTON. 

Fort Cumberland, 18 July, 1755. 

DEAR BROTHER, 
As I have heard, since my arrival at this place, a cir- 

regaining the ground, and what we had left upon it, it was with as little 
success as if we had attempted to stop the wild bears of the mountains, or 
the rivulets with our feet. 

" It is supposed, that we had three hundred or more killed, and about 
that number were brought off wounded. It is conjectured (I believe with 
much truth), that two thirds of both received their shot from our own 
cowardly regulars, who gathered themselves into a body, contrary to orders, 
ten or twelve deep, would then level, fire, and shoot down the men 
before them."

cumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I 
take this early opportunity of contradicting the first, and 
of assuring you, that I have not as yet composed the 
latter. But, by the all-powerful dispensations of Provi- 
dence, I have been protected beyond all human proba- 
bility or expectation ; for I had four bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt, 
although death was levelling my companions on every 
side of me ! 

We have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling 
body of men, but fatigue and want of time prevent me 
from giving you any of the details, until I have the hap- 
piness of seeing you at Mount Vernon, which I now 
most ardently wish for, since we are driven in thus far. 
A feeble state of health obliges me to halt here for 
two or three days, to recover a little strength, that I 
may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with 
more ease. You may expect to see me there on Sat- 
urday or Sunday fortnight, which is as soon as I can 
well be down, as I shall take my Bullskin Plantations* 
in my way. Pray give my compliments to all my 
friends. I am, dear Jack, your most affectionate

Such was the alarm created by the success of the French at Braddock's 
defeat, that volunteer companies embodied themselves in different parts of 
Virginia to march to the frontiers. The Reverend Samuel Davies, at that 
time a clergyman in Hanover county, preached a sermon to one of these 
companies, on the 17th of August, which was printed in Philadelphia and 
London, and entitled " Religion and Patriotism the Constituents of a Good

TO ROBERT JACKSON. 

Mount Vernon, 2 August, 1755. 

DEAR SIR, 

I must acknowledge you had great reason to be terri- 
fied at the first accounts, that were given of our unhappy 
defeat ; and, I must own, I was not a little surprised to 
find, that Governor Innes was the means of alarming 
the country with a report so extraordinary, without hav- 
ing better confirmation of the truth, than the story of an 
affrighted wagoner ! 

It is true, we have been beaten, shamefully beaten, 
by a handful of men, who only intended to molest and 
disturb our march. Victory was their smallest expec- 
tation. But see the wondrous works of Providence, 
and the uncertainty of human things ! We, but a few 
moments before, believed our numbers almost equal to 
the Canadian force ; they only expected to annoy us. 
Yet, contrary to all expectation and human probability, 
and even to the common course of things, we were 
totally defeated, and sustained the loss of every thing. 
This, as you observe, must be an affecting story to the 
colony, and will, no doubt, license the tongues of people 
to censure those, whom they think most blamable; 
which, by the by, often falls very wrongfully. I join 
very heartily with you in believing, that when this story 
comes to be related in future annals, it will meet with 
unbelief and indignation, for had I not been witness to 



heroic youth, Colonel Washington, whom I cannot but hope Providence 
has hitherto preserved in so signal a manner for some important service 
to his country." 

This prophetic passage may at least serve as an evidence of the elevated 
standing, to which Washington had already raised himself in the esteem 
of his countrymen, by his bravery and good conduct. Mr. Davies was 
afterwards President of the College at Princeton, in New Jersey.

the fact on that fatal day, I should scarcely have given 
credit to it even now.* 

Whenever it suits you to come into Fairfax, I hope 
you will make your home at Mount Vernon. I assure 
you, nothing could have added more to the satisfaction 
of my safe return, than hearing of the friendly concern 
that has been expressed on my supposed death. I

TO AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON. f 

Mount Vernon, 2 August, 1755. 

DEAR BROTHER, 

The pleasure of your company at Mount Vernon 
always did, and always will, afford me infinite satisfac- 
tion ; but, at this time, I am too sensible how needful 
the country is of all the assistance of its members, to 
have a wish to hear that any are absent from the As- 
sembly. 

I most sincerely wish, that unanimity may prevail in 
all your counsels, and that a happy issue may attend 
your deliberations at this important crisis. 

I am not able, were I ever so willing, to meet you in 
town, for, I assure you, it is with some difficulty, and 
much fatigue, that I visit my plantations ; so much has 
a sickness of five weeks' continuance reduced me. But 
though it is not in my power to meet you there, I can 
nevertheless assure you, and others "whom it may con- 
cern," (to borrow a phrase from Governor Innes,) that, 
so little am I dispirited at what has happened, I am

always ready, and always willing, to render my country 
any services that I am capable of, but never upon the 
terms I have done ; having suffered much in my private 
fortune, besides impairing one of the best of constitutions. 

I was employed to go a journey in the winter, when, 
I believe, few or none would have undertaken it, and 
what did I get by it ? My expenses borne ! I then was 
appointed, with trifling pay, to conduct a handful of men 
to the Ohio. What did I get by that? Why, after 
putting myself to a considerable expense, in equipping 
and providing necessaries for the campaign, I went out, 
was soundly beaten, and lost them all ! came in, and 
had my commission taken from me, or, in other words, 
my command reduced, under pretence of an order from 
home ! I then went out a volunteer with General Brad- 
dock, and lost all my horses, and many other things. 
But this being a voluntary act, I ought not to have men- 
tioned it ; nor should I have done it, were it not to show, 
that I have been upon the losing order ever since I en- 
tered the service, which is now nearly two years. So 
that I think I cannot be blamed, should I, if I leave my 
family again, endeavour to do it upon such terms, as to 
prevent my suffering ; to gain by it being the least of 
my expectations. 

I doubt not but you have heard the particulars of our 
shameful defeat, which really was so scandalous, that I 
hate to mention it. You desire to know what artillery 
was taken in the late engagement. It is easily told. 
We lost all that we carried out, excepting two six- 
pounders, and a few cohorns, which were left with 
Colonel Dunbar ; and the cohorns have since been de- 
stroyed to accelerate his flight. You also ask, whether 
I think the forces can march out again this fall. I ans- 
wer, I think it impossible, at least, for them to do the 
French any damage (unless it be by starving them), for 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 93 

the want of a proper train of artillery ; yet they may be 
very serviceable in erecting small fortresses at conve- 
nient places to deposit provisions in, by which means 
the country will be eased of an immense expense in the 
carriage, and it will also be a means of securing a re- 
treat, if we should be put to the rout again. The 
success of this measure, however, will depend greatly 
upon what Governor Shirley does at Niagara ; for, if he 
succeeds, their communication with Canada will be en- 
tirely cut off. 

It is impossible for me to guess at the number of 
recruits, that may be wanted, as that must depend alto- 
gether upon the strength of the French on the Ohio, 
which, to my great astonishment, we were always 
strangers to. 

I thank you, very heartily, for your kind offer of a 
chair, and for your goodness in sending my things ; and, 
after begging you to excuse the imperfections of this 
letter, which, in part, are owing to my having much 
company that hurries me, I shall conclude, dear Sir, 

Your most affectionate brother.

If it is in my power to avoid going to the Ohio again, 
I shall ; but if the command is pressed upon me, by the 
general voice of the country, and offered upon such 
terms as cannot be objected against, it would reflect 
dishonor upon me to refuse it ; and that, I am sure, must 
or ought to give you greater uneasiness, than my going 
in an honorable command. Upon no other terms will I

TO WARNER LEWIS. 

Mount Vernon, 14 August, 1755. 

DEAR SIR, 

After returning you most sincere and grateful thanks, 
for your kind condolence on my late indisposition, and 
for the generous and (give me leave farther to say) partial 
opinion, you have entertained of my military abilities, I 
must express my concern for not having it in my power 
to meet you, and other friends, who have signified their 
desire of seeing me in Williamsburg.* 

Your letter only came to hand at nine last night, and 
you inform me, that the Assembly will break up the 
latter end of the week, which allows a time too short in 
which to perform a journey of a hundred and sixty 
miles, especially 'by a person in my feeble condition; 
for, although I am happily recovered from the disorder, 
which brought me to so low an ebb, by a sickness 
of nearly five weeks' continuance, yet my strength 

* Mr. Ludwell, another of his friends in the Assembly, had written to him 
on the 8th of August. "I most heartily congratulate you on your safe re- 
turn from so many dangers and fatigues, and by this time I hope you are 
well enough recovered to give us the pleasure of seeing you here, which 
all your friends are extremely desirous of. The House has voted twelve 
hundred men, but it is very probable they will determine at last for four 
thousand. In conversation with the Governor I said, if this should be 
done I supposed his Honor would give the command of them to Colonel 
Washington, for I thought he deserved every thing his country could do 
for him. The Governor made reply much in your favor, though I under- 
stand there is another warm solicitation for it. If we could be so happy 
as to have you here at this time, and it were known that you are willing 
to take such a command, I believe it would greatly promote the success 
of our endeavours with the Assembly."

is not returned. Had I received timely notice, I would 
have attempted the ride, by slow and easy journeys, if it 
had been only for the satisfaction of seeing my friends, 
who, I flatter myself, from what you say, are kind enough 
to sympathize in my good and evil fortunes. 

The chief cause, next to indisposition, that prevented 
me from going down to this Assembly, was a determi- 
nation not to offer my services ; and that determination 
proceeded from the following reasons. First, a belief 
that I could not get a command upon such terms as I 
should incline to accept; for I must confess to you, that 
I never will quit my family, injure my fortune, and, above 
all, impair my health, to run the risk of such changes 
and vicissitudes, as I have met with, but shall expect, if 
I am employed again, to have something certain. Again, 
were I to accept the command, I should insist upon 
some things, which ignorance and inexperience made 
me overlook before, particularly that of having the offi- 
cers appointed, in some measure, with my advice and 
with my concurrence. It appears to me strange, that a 
commanding officer should not have this liberty, when 
it is considered how much the conduct and bravery of 
an officer influence the men, how much a commanding 
officer is answerable for the behaviour of the inferior 
officers, and how much his good or ill success, in time 
of action, depends upon the conduct of each particular 
one, especially too, in this kind of fighting, where, being 
dispersed, each and every one of them has a greater 
liberty to misbehave, than if he were regularly and 
compactly drawn up under the eyes of his superior. 

On the other hand, how little credit is given to a 
commander, who, after a defeat, in relating the cause of 
it, justly lays the blame on some individual, whose cow- 
ardly behaviour betrayed the whole to ruin. How little 
does the world consider the circumstances, and how apt

are mankind to level their vindictive censures against the 
unfortunate chief, who perhaps merited least of the blame. 

Does it not appear, then, that the appointing of offi-

haviour 1 

Officers are yet wanting, for whom no provision h 
been made. A small military chest is so necessary, 
that it is impossible to do without it, nor .can any man 
conduct an affair of this kind, who has it not. 

These things I should expect, if the appointment 
should fall upon me. 

But, besides all these, I had other reasons, which 
withheld me from offering my services. I believe our 
circumstances are brought to such an unhappy dilemma, 
that no man can gain any honor by conducting our forces 
at this time, but will rather lose in his reputation if he 
attempts it. I am confident, that the progress of mili- 
tary movements must be slow, for want of conveniences 
to transport our provisions, ammunition, and stores, over 
the mountains ; occasioned, in a great measure, by the 
late ill treatment of the wagoners and horse- drivers, 
who have received little compensation for their labor, 
and nothing for their lost horses and wagons ; wilich 
will be an infallible cause of preventing all from assisting, 
who are not compelled. Hence I am fully sensible, that 
whoever undertakes this command will meet with such 
insurmountable obstacles, that he will soon be viewed in 
the light of an idle, indolent body, have his conduct 
criticized, and meet perhaps with abuse, when it may 
be as much out of his power to avoid delays, as it would 
be to command the raging seas in a storm. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 97 

This view of things has had no small influence upon 
me, as I am very apprehensive I should lose, what at 
present constitutes the chief part of my happiness, that 
is, the esteem and notice, which the country has been 
pleased to honor me with. 

It is possible you may infer from what I have said, 
that my intentions are to decline, at all events ; but this 
is not my meaning. I am determined not to offer ; be- 
cause to solicit the command, and, at the same time, to 
make my proposals, w r ould be a little incongruous, and 
carry with it the face of self-sufficiency. But if the 
command should be offered to me, the case will then be 
altered, as I should be at liberty to make such objections, 
as reason and my small experience have pointed out* 

I am, dear Warner, your most affectionate friend, and 
obedient servant. 



* While Colonel Washington was writing this letter, he had already 
been appointed to the command. The Assembly voted forty thousand 
pounds for the public service, and the Governor and Council immediately 
resolved to increase the Virginia regiment to sixteen companies. In the 
same act, the Assembly also granted to George Washington the sum of 
three hundred pounds, to the captains seventy-five pounds each, to the 
lieutenants and surgeon thirty pounds, and to every soldier five pounds, as 
" a reward and compensation for their gallant behaviour and losses," at the 
battle of the Monongahela. 

The Governor's commission and instructions to Colonel Washington, as 
commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces, are dated on the 14th of Au- 
gust. He was allowed all that is demanded in the above letter, and also 
to appoint an aid-de-camp and secretary. The next officers in rank under 
him were Lieutenant-Colonel Adam Stephen, and Major Andrew Lewis. 
The following extract from a letter, written by Governor Dinwiddie to 
Sir Thomas Robinson, Secretary of State, is a proof of the estimation in 
which Colonel Washington was at this time held, and that he was recom- 
mended to the favorable notice of the King. 

" I have granted commissions to raise sixteen companies, augmenting 
our forces to one thousand men, and have incorporated them into a regi- 
ment, the command thereof being given to Colonel George Washington, 
who was one of General Braddock's aids-de-camp, and I think a man of 
great merit and resolution. Our officers are greatly dispirited for want of 
his Majesty's commissions, that, when they join the regulars, they may

The country has come to a resolution to raise six- 
teen companies, which are to be formed into a regiment, 
and of which they have honored me with the command. 
I am allowed the liberty of appointing my field officers ; 
in consequence of which, I have ' commissioned you as 
major, and must desire you will, as soon as Captain 
Hogg arrives, and takes the command of your company, 
repair to Fredericksburg with all imaginable despatch, 
to take charge of the recruits, that shall be brought to 
that place of rendezvous. I know your diligence and 
punctuality require little or no spur ; yet, as this is an 
affair that calls for the greatest despatch, I must earn- 
estly recommend it to you. Be careful in getting a 
proper return of your company, that I may order things 
accordingly. 

A return must also be delivered to Captain Hogg, not 
only of the men, but of the arms, tools, &LC., and his

I am convinced, if General Braddock had survived, he would have recom- 
mended Mr. Washington to the royal favor, which I beg your interest in 
recommending." 

* As soon as Colonel Washington was informed of his appointment, he 
repaired to Williamsburg to consult with the governor respecting future 
operations. When he wrote this letter he was on his return to Win- 
chester, which place was fixed upon as his head-quarters. The two 
other points of rendezvous for the recruits were Fredericksburg and 
Alexandria. 



PARTI.] THE FRENCH WAR. 99 

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES, VIRGINIA. 

Alexandria, 11 September, 3755. 

SIR, 

After a small halt at Fredericksburg, to issue orders 
to the recruiting officers appointed to that rendezvous, 
I proceeded to this place, in order to collect a return of 
the provisions and clothing, that were lodged here ; an 
exact copy of which I herewith send you. I find, after 
the soldiers have their short allowances, there will arise 
great inconveniences, if stores of clothing are not laid in 
to supply their wants ; particularly shoes, stockings, and 
shirts, for these are the least durable and most needed. 

The method I would recommend is, for the country 
to provide these things, and lodge them, or a convenient 
part of them, in the hands of the quartermaster, who 
may be appointed to receive and deliver them to the 
soldiers, by particular orders from their captains, taking 
care to produce these orders and proper vouchers for 
the delivery, each pay-day, when the amount must be 
deducted out of the soldier's pay, who receives them. 
This, I think, will be a means of keeping them always 
provided and fit for duty, and of preventing the officers 
from supplying the men, which is generally attended 
with misunderstandings. It will also be a means of 
discouraging followers of the army from demanding 
such exorbitant prices, as is usually practised on these 
occasions. 

However, I only offer this as the most efficacious 
method I can at present think of. If any more eligible 
one can be found, I should be glad to see it executed, as 
something of the kind must be done, otherwise the sol- 
diers will be barefoot, which is always a plea for exemp- 
tion from duty ; and, indeed, in the approaching season 
it will be a very just one. You will be a judge, when

[Mr. 23. 



you see the returns, what had best be done with the 
provisions. The quantity is too great for the present 
consumption, and to wagon it up can never answer the 
expense. 

Major Carlyle thinks the West India market best, as 
the returns will be in rum, which he can soon turn into 
flour at the camp. 

I am afraid I shall not be able to push things with 
vigor this fall, for want of a commissary who will act 
with spirit. Mr. Dick seems determined not to enter 
into any further contracts, unless he is better supported, 
or until he meets the Committee in October ; by which 
time the best season for engaging beef will be almost 
over. The Governor, by the advice of Sir John St. Clair, 
expressed, just as I was coming away, his desire of hav- 
ing him continued ; so that I am entirely ignorant how 
to act. The making of contracts myself is foreign to my 
duty ; neither have I time ; and to see the service suffer 
will give me infinite uneasiness, as I would gladly con- 
duct every thing, as far as I am capable, with life and 
spirit. This never can be done unless a fund of money 
is lodged in camp for defraying the contingent charges. 
As I believed it difficult to get all the clothing in any 
one part of the country, I engaged it where I could, and 
have got shoes, stockings, shirts, and hats enough upon 
tolerably good terms, as you may see by the enclosed. 

Major Carlyle is also willing to engage one hundred 
complete suits, as good as those imported, for three 
pounds, or less ; with which I have acquainted the Gov- 
ernor. I believe them to be as cheap as can be got 
below, as it is the making chiefly, that occasions the 
difference between those imported, and those provided 
here. I am, &,c.*

TO GOVERNOR DLffWIDDIE. 

Fredericksburg, 8 October, 1755. 

SIR, 

I arrived at this place in less than three hours after I 
wrote you from Colonel Baylor's. Shortly afterwards 
arrived also Colonel Stephen, who gives a worse ac- 
count, than he related in his letter; but as he is the 
bearer of this, I shall be the less prolix, referring to him 
for particulars. 

I shall set out this evening for Winchester, where I 
expect to be joined by the recruits from Alexandria and 
this place, as soon as they can possibly march that dis- 
tance ; also, by one hundred men from Prince William 
and Frederic. I have written to Fairfax county, de- 
siring that a troop of horse may hold themselves in 
readiness to march at an hour's warning. So that I doubt 
not, that, with this assistance, I shall be able to repulse 
the enemy, if they are still committing their outrages 
upon the inhabitants. We are at a loss for want of 
almost every necessary, tents, kettles, arms, ammu- 
nition^ and cartridge-paper. I hope, as your Honor 
did not send to Philadelphia for them, you will, if 
possible, endeavour to get them below, and send them 

ing the necessary orders, and collecting returns of the provisions and 
clothing at Alexandria, and stores at Rock Creek, I proceeded to Win- 
chester, where I arrived on the 14th of September. Thence I went to 
Fort Cumberland, and took upon me the command of the troops there, 
issuing the daily orders, and giving such instructions and directions as ap- 
peared necessary. Thence to Fort Dinwiddie on Jackson's River. After 
examining the state of things there, I set out for Alexandria, and arrived 
on the 2d of October. On the 5th reached Fredericksburg in my way to 
Williamsburg. Continued my journey to Colonel Baylor's, where I was 
overtaken by an express sent from Colonel Stephen (commanding at Fort 
Cumberland), informing me that a body of Indians had fallen upon the in- 
habitants, killed many of them, and destroyed and burnt several of their 
houses. Thereupon I wrote to the Governor, and returned immediately to 
Fredericksburg."

>y the first opportunity to this place, or Alexandria, 
with orders that they may be forwarded immediately to 
Winchester. 

I must again take the liberty of mentioning to you 
the necessity of putting the militia, when they are drawn 
out into actual service, under better regulation than they 
are at present, as well as of putting us under a military 
law. Otherwise we shall only be a burthensome charge 
to the country, and the others will prove its ruin. That 
this may not appear an unmeaning expression, I refer 
you to Lieutenant- Colonel Stephen, who can give you 
some late proofs of their disobedience and inconsistent 
behaviour. 

As these affairs will take some time, I find I cannot 
possibly be in Williamsburg till the 6th, 7th, or 8th of 
November, when I should be glad to meet a committee, 
in order to settle with them and your Honor some 
points, that are very necessary for the good of the ex- 
pedition. 

Colonel Stephen has orders to receive some money 
below, that we may be enabled to pay the troops, keep 
them in spirits, and answer such immediate charges as 
cannot be dispensed with, until I come down. I should 
be glad if your Honor would order him to repair there- 
with (as soon as he has done his business with the com- 
mittee) to Winchester ; and from thence, with a proper 
guard, to Fort Cumberland. I hope the treasury will 
have a sufficient sum of money prepared against I come 
down, that I may meet with no delay. 

There are about seventy recruits at this place, and I 
left twenty-five at Alexandria. I suppose they are aug- 
mented before this time by officers, who, I am sorry to 
say, have paid slight regard to orders, by not being in at 
the time appointed. I am, &,c.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 11 October, 1755. 

SIR, 

As I think it my indispensable duty to inform you 
particularly of my proceedings, and to give the most 
plain and authentic accounts, from time to time, of our 
situation, I must acquaint you that, immediately after 
giving" the necessary orders at Fredericksburg, and 
despatching expresses to hurry the recruits from Alex- 
andria, I rode post to this place. I passed by Lord 
Fairfax's, who was not at home, but was here, where I 
arrived yesterday about noon, and found every thing in 
the greatest hurry and confusion, by the back inhabitants 
flocking in, and those of this town moving out, which I 
have, as far as was in my power, prevented. I was de- 
sirous of proceeding immediately, at the head of some 
militia, to put a stop to the ravages of the enemy, be- 
lieving their numbers to be few; but I was told by 
Colonel Martin, who had attempted to raise the militia 
for the same purpose, that it was impossible to get above 
twenty or twenty-five men, they having absolutely re- 
fused to stir, choosing, as they say, to die with their 
wives and families. 

Finding this expedient likely to prove abortive, I 
sent off expresses to hurry on the recruits from below, 
and the militia from Fairfax and Prince William, who 
had been ordered out by Lord Fairfax. I also hired 
spies to go out and discover the numbers of the enemy, 
and to encourage the rangers, who, we were told, were 
blocked up by the Indians in small fortresses. But, if I 
may offer my opinion, I believe they are more encom- 
passed with fear, than by the enemy. I have also 
impressed wagons and sent them to Conococheague for 
flour, musket-balls, and flints. Powder, and a trifling 



104 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



. 23. 



quantity of paper, bought at extravagant prices, for car- 
tridges, I expect from below. 

Six or eight smiths are now at work, repairing the 
firearms that are here, which are all that we have to de- 
pend upon. A man was hired, on the 24th of last 
month, to do the whole, but neglected it, and was just 
moving off to Pennsylvania in wagons. I impressed his 
wagons, and compelled him by force to assist in this 
work. In all things I meet with the greatest opposition. 

No orders are obeyed, but such as a party of soldiers, 
or my own drawn sword, enforces. Without this, not 
a single horse, for the most earnest occasion, can be 
had, to such a pitch has the insolence of these people 
arrived, by having every point hitherto submitted to 
them. However, I have given up none, where his Maj- 
esty's service requires the contrary, and where my pro- 
ceedings are justified by my instructions; nor will I, 
unless they execute what they threaten, that is, " blow 
out our brains." 

I have invited the poor distressed people, who were 
driven from their habitations, to lodge their families in 
some place of security, and to join our parties in scour- 
ing the woods, where the enemy lie ; and I believe 
some will cheerfully assist. I have also taken, and shall 
continue to take, every previous step to forward the 
march of the recruits, as soon as they arrive here. Your 
Honor may depend, that nothing in my power shall be 
wanting for the good of the service. I would again hint 
the necessity of putting the militia under a better regu- 
lation, had I not mentioned it twice before, and a third 
time may seem impertinent. But I must once more 
beg leave to declare, for here I am more immediately 
concerned, that, unless the Assembly will pass an act to 
enforce the military law in all its parts, I must, with 
great regret, decline the honor that has been so gener- 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 105 

ously intended me. I am urged to this, by the fore- 
knowledge I have of failing in every point, that might 
justly be expected from a person invested with full 
power to execute his authority. I see the growing 
insolence of the soldiers, and the indolence and inactivity 
of the officers, who are all sensible how limited their 
punishments are, compared with what they ought to be. 
In fine, I can plainly see, that under the present estab- 
lishment, we shall become a nuisance, an insupportable 
charge to our country, and never answer any one ex- 
pectation of the Assembly. And here I must assume 
the freedom to express some surprise, that we alone 
should be so tenacious of our liberty, as not to invest a 
power, where interest and policy so unanswerably de- 
mand it, and whence so much good must consequently 
ensue. Do we not know, that every nation under the 
sun finds its account therein, and that, without it, no order 
or regularity can be observed 1 Why then should it be 
expected from us, who are all young and inexperienced, 
to govern and keep up a proper spirit of discipline with- 
out laws, when the best and most experienced can 
scarcely do it with them ? If we consult our interest, I 
am sure it loudly calls for them. I can confidently 
assert, that recruiting, clothing, arming, maintaining, and 
subsisting soldiers, who have since deserted, have cost 
the country an immense sum, which might have been 
prevented, were we under restraints, that would terrify 
the soldiers from such practices. 

One thing more on this head I will recommend, and 
then quit the subject ; that is, to have the inhabitants 
liable to certain heavy fines, or corporal punishments, 
for entertaining deserters, and a reward offered for tak- 
ing them up. If this were done, it would be next to an 
impossibility for a soldier to escape ; but, as things now 
stand, they are not only seduced to run away, but are

also harboured and assisted with every necessary means 
to do it. 

Sunday noon. Last night arrived an express, just 
spent with fatigue and fear, reporting that a party of 
Indians were seen about twelve miles off, at the planta- 
tion of one Isaac Julian, and that the inhabitants were 
flying in the most promiscuous manner from their dwel- 
lings. I immediately ordered the town guards to be 
strengthened, Perkins's lieutenant to be in readiness 
with his companies, some recruits, who had only arrived 
about half an hour before, to be armed, and sent two 
men, well acquainted with the roads, to go up that road, 
and lie in wait, to see if they could discover the num- 
ber and motion of the Indians, that we might have 
timely notice of their approach. This morning, before 
we could parade the men, arrived a second express, ten 
times more terrified than the former, with information, 
that the Indians had got within four miles of the town, 
and were killing and destroying all before them, and that 
he himself had heard constant firing, and shrieks of the 
unhappy murdered ! Upon this, I immediately collected 
what force I could, which consisted of twenty -two men, 
recruited for the rangers, and nineteen of the militia, 
and marched directly to the place, where these horrid 
murders were said to be committed. When we came 
there, whom should we find occasioning all this dis- 
turbance, but three drunken soldiers of the light-horse, 
carousing, firing their pistols, and uttering the most 
unheard-of imprecations ? These we took, and marched 
them as prisoners to town, where we met the men I 
sent out last night, and learned that the party of Indians, 
discovered by Isaac Julian, proved to be a mulatto and 
negro, seen hunting cattle by his child, who alarmed the 
father, and the father the neighbourhood. 



PART I.] THE FRENCH WAR. 107 

These circumstances are related only to show what a 
panic prevails among the people ; how much they are 
alarmed at the most usual and customary cries; and 
yet how impossible it is to get them to act in any respect 
for their common safety. As an instance of this, Colonel 
Fairfax, who arrived in town while we were upon a 
scout, immediately sent to a noble captain, not far off, to 
repair with his company forthwith to Winchester. With 
coolness and moderation this great captain answered, 
that his wife, family, and corn were all at stake; so 
were those of his soldiers ; therefore it was impossible 
for him to come. Such is the example of the officers ; 
such the behaviour of the men ; and upon such cir- 
cumstances depends the safety of our country ! 

>v 

Monday morning. The men I hired to bring intelli- 
gence from the Branch returned last night, with letters 
from Captain Ashby, and the other parties there ; by 
which I learn, that the Indians are gone off; scouts 
having been dispersed upon those waters for several 
days, without discovering tracks or other signs of the 
enemy. 

I am also informed, that it is believed their numbers 
amounted to about one hundred and fifty ; that seventy 
of our men are killed and missing, and several houses 
and plantations destroyed, but not so great havoc made 
as was represented at first. The rangers, and a small 
company of militia, ordered there by Lord Fairfax, I am 
given to understand, intend to march down on Monday 
next. They will be immediately followed by all the 
inhabitants of those parts, that had come together under 
their protection. I have, therefore, sent peremptory 
orders to the contrary ; but what obedience will be paid 
to them a little time will reveal. I have ordered those 
men, that were recruited for the rangers, to join their 



108 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. |yE T . 23. 

respective companies. A party of militia, commanded 
by Captain Harden, also marched with them. Captain 
Waggener is this instant arrived with thirty recruits, 
whom he marched from Bellhaven in less than three 
days, a great march indeed ! Major Lewis and his 
recruits from Fredericksburg I expect in to-morrow, 
when, with these and twenty-two of Captain Bell's now 
here, I shall proceed by quick marches to Fort Cum- 
berland, in order to strengthen that garrison. Besides 
these, I think it absolutely essential, that there should 
be two or three companies exclusively of rangers, to 
guard the Potomac waters, until such time as our regi- 
ment is completed. Indeed, the rangers and volunteer 
companies in Augusta, with some of their militia, should 
be properly disposed of on those frontiers, for fear of an 
attack from that quarter. But this is submitted to your 
Honor's judgment, and waits your orders for its execu- 
tion, if thought expedient. 

Captain Waggener informs me, that it was with 
difficulty he passed the Ridge for crowds of people, 
who were flying as if every moment was death. He 
endeavoured, but in vain, to stop them ; they firmly 
believing that Winchester was in flames. I shall send 
expresses down the several roads in hopes of bringing 
back the inhabitants, who are really frightened out of 
their senses. I despatched an express immediately 
upon my arrival at this place, with a copy of the en- 
closed letter to Andrew Montour, who I heard was at a 
place called Long Island, with three hundred Indians, 
to see if he could engage him and them to join us. I 
also wrote to Gist, acquainting him with the favor you 
intended him, and desired he would repair home, in 
order to raise his companies of scouts. * 

* Mr. Gist had been sent to Philadelphia for some object connected

I shall defer writing to the Speaker and Committee 
upon any other head, than that of commissary, still hop- 
ing to be down by the time mentioned in my last, 
provided no new disturbances happen, having some 
points to settle, that I am uneasy and urgent about. I 
have been obliged to do duty very foreign to my own ; 
but that I shall never hesitate about, when the good of 
the service requires it. 

In a journey from Fort Cumberland to Fort Dinwid- 
die, which I made purposely to see the situation of our 
frontiers, how the rangers were posted, and how troops 
might be disposed of for the defence of the country, I 
purchased six hundred and fifty beeves, to be delivered 
at Fort Cumberland by the 1st of November, at ten 
shillings per hundred weight, except a few for which I 
was obliged to give eleven shillings. My own bonds 
are now out for the performance of these covenants. 
This is the commissary's business, who, I am sorry to 
say, has hitherto been of no use, but of disservice to me, 
in neglecting my orders, and leaving this place without 
flour, and Fredericksburg without any provisions for 
the recruits, although he had timely notice. I must beg, 
that, if Mr. Dick will not act, some other person may be 
appointed ; for, if things remain in this uncertain situa- 
tion, the season will pass without having provision made 
for the winter, or the summer campaign.

would enlist a good number, especially to be irregulars, for all their talk is 
of fighting the Indian way. The Assembly of Pennsylvania is now sitting. 
Mr. Franklin and Mr. Peters both told me, that, if you would write a pres-

desiring their assistance, you would now get it sooner than any one iii

TO GOVERNOR DINWLDDIE. 






Winchester, 17 October, 1755. 

SIR, 

Last night by the return of the express, who went to 
Captain Montour, I received the enclosed from Mr. Har- 
ris at the Susquehanna. I think no means should be 
neglected to preserve the few Indians, who still remain 
in our interest. For which reason I shall send Mr. Gist, 
as soon as he arrives (which I expect will be to-day), 
to Harris's Ferry, in hopes of engaging and bringing 
with him the Belt of Wampum and other Indians at that 
place. I shall further desire him to send an Indian ex- 
press to Andrew Montour, to try if he cannot be brought 
with them. 

In however trifling a light the attempts of the French 
to alienate the affections of our southern Indians may at 
first appear, I must look upon it as a thing of the utmost 
consequence, requiring our greatest and most immediate 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. HI 

attention. I have often wondered at not hearing this 
was attempted before, and had it noted among other 
memorandums to acquaint your Honor with, when I 
should come down. 

The French policy in treating with the Indians is so 
prevalent, that I should not be in the least surprised, 
were they to engage the Cherokees, Catawbas, and 
others, unless timely and vigorous measures are taken 
to prevent it. 

A pusillanimous behaviour now will ill suit the times ; 
and trusting to traders and common interpreters, who 
will sell their integrity to the highest bidder, may prove 
the destruction of these affairs. I therefore think, that 
if a person of distinction, acquainted with their language, 
is to be found, his price should be come to at any rate. 
If no such person can be had, a man of sense and char- 
acter, who may conduct the Indians to a council, or 
superintend any other matters, will be found extremely 
necessary. It is impertinent, I own, in me to offer my 
opinion in these affairs, when better judges may direct ; 
but my steady and hearty zeal for the cause, and the 
great impositions I have known practised by the traders 
upon these occasions, would not suffer me to be quite 
silent. I have heard, from undoubted authority, that 
some of the Cherokees, introduced to us as sachems 
and princes by the interpreter, who shares the profits, 
have been no other than common hunters, and blood- 
thirsty villains. 

We have no accounts yet of the militia from Fairfax. 
This day I march with about one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland. Yesterday an express informed me of 
eighty recruits at Fredericksburg, whom I have ordered

TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ADAM STEPHEN. 



SIR, 



Fredericksburg, 18 November, 1755. 



I came to this place on Sunday last, and intended to 
proceed immediately up ; f but your letter and others, 
contradicting the late reports, determined me to go to 
Alexandria, where I shall wait a few days, hoping to 
meet the express from General Shirley, to whom the 
Governor sent for commissions for the field-officers, 



* To a captain he wrote; "Your late disobedience of orders has 
greatly displeased me. It is impossible to carry on affairs as they ought 
to be, when you pay so little regard to a military order. You must be con- 
scious, that your crime is sufficient to break the best officer, that ever bore 
a commission." 

f He was now returning from Williamsburg to head-quarters at Win- 
chester, having previously made a journey to Fort Cumberland. 

| The old difficulty about rank between the provincial officers, and 
those with King's commissions, had been revived at Fort Cumberland. 

Immediately after the affair of the Great Meadows, the Assembly of 
Maryland granted the small sum of six thousand pounds for the defence 
of the frontiers, and in the December following they passed an act au- 
thorizing the Governor to raise a military force. A few soldiers only 
were enlisted, and at this time a Maryland company of thirty men was 
stationed at Fort Cumberland, under the command of Captain Dagwor- 
thy, who had been an officer in the Canada expedition during the last war, 
and had received a King's commission. Governor Innes had gone home to 
North Carolina on his private affairs. Dagworthy assumed the command, 
and refused to obey any orders of a provincial officer, however high in 
rank. This created wranglings and insubordination among the inferior 
officers, who took sides. The Governor of Maryland was tardy in giving 
any decisive orders to Dagworthy, because the fort was in that province, 
and he seemed willing to consider it under his command. Governor Din- 
widdie argued, that it was a King's fort, built by an order sent to him from 
the King, chiefly by forces in the King's pay, and that it could in no sense

I beg that you will be particularly careful in seeing 
strict order observed among the soldiers, as that is the 
life of military discipline. We now have it in our power 
to enforce obedience ; and obedience will be expected 
from us, the men being subject to death, as in military 
law. The Assembly have also offered a reward to all 
who will apprehend deserters, and a severe punishment 
upon those, who shall entertain or suffer them to pass, 
and upon any constable, who refuses to convey them to 
the company or troop to which they belong, or shall 
suffer them to escape, after such deserters are com- 
mitted to his custody. 

be regarded as subject to the authority of Maryland. And, moreover, as 
Captain Dagworthy had commuted his half-pay for a specific sum of 
money, his commission had thereby become obsolete, and there was no 
propriety in his pretending to act under it ; and it was an absurdity for 
a captain with thirty men, who in reality had no other commission than 
that from the Governor of Maryland, to claim precedence of the com- 
mander-in-chief of all the Virginia forces. 

Colonel Washington refused to interfere, but made a forcible remon- 
strance to the Governor and Council at Williamsburg, and insisted on a 
speedy arrangement, that should put an end to the difficulty. To effect 
this purpose, Governor Dinwiddie sent an express to General Shirley, 
commander of his Majesty's forces in North America, stating the particu- 
lars of the case, and requesting from him brevet commissions for Colonel 
Washington, and the field-officers under him; proposing, at the same 
time, that these commissions should only imply rank, without giving any 
claim to pay from the King. Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. Laws of 
Maryland, 1754. 

The Governor's troubles seemed to thicken at this crisis. On the 15th 
of November he wrote to the Earl of Halifax ; 

" Our Assembly met on the 29th ultimo, but not above one half of them 
gave their attendance. They fell into cabals, and wanted to emit two 
hundred thousand pounds in paper money for a loan-office, to be dis- 
charged in eight years, which I thought to be contrary to act of Parliament 
and my instructions. They further proposed a secret committee, which, 
in course, would have been the beginning of great dissensions. They 
likewise were very mutinous and unmannerly. For their not meeting in a 
body when summoned, and for the above conduct, I thought it for his Maj- 
esty's service, and for the good of this Dominion, to dissolve them, and 
take my chance of a new election, which I think cannot be so bad as the 
last" ,

These things, with the articles of war and a proper 
exhortation, I would have you read immediately to the 
men, and see that it is frequently done hereafter. I 
must desire, that you will use all possible means to 
facilitate the salting of our provisions, and give the com- 
missary such assistance as he shall reasonably require. 
The Governor approves of the Committee's resolve, in 
not allowing either the Maryland or Carolina companies 
to be supported out of our provisions. This you are to 
make them acquainted with, and, in case any of the 
companies should be discharged, to use your utmost 
endeavours to enlist as many of the men as you can. 
Lieutenant M c Manners has leave to go to Carolina, 
if he desires it. The Assembly would make no alter- 
ation in our militia law ; nor would the Governor order 
the militia to be drafted to complete our regiment, so 
that the slow method of recruiting is likely to be our 
only means of raising the men. I think, could a brisk 
officer, and two or three sergeants, be sent among the 
militia stationed on the South Branch, they would have 
a probable chance of engaging many, as some were 
inclined to enlist at Winchester. Doctor Craik is ex- 
pected round to Alexandria in a vessel, with medicines 
and other stores for the regiment. As soon as he 
arrives, I shall take care to despatch him to you. 

The Colonels Byrd and Randolph are appointed 
commissioners,* and will set out very shortly with a 
present for the Cherokees, in order to engage them in 
our interest. I am, &,c.

TO COLONEL ADAM STEPHEN. 

Alexandria, 28 November, 1755. 

SIR, 

I received your two letters by Jenkins last night, and 
was greatly surprised to hear that Commissary Walker 
was not arrived at camp, when he came away. He set 
out from Williamsburg about the 12th instant, with or- 
ders to proceed immediately up ; but such disobedience 
of commands, as I have generally met with, is insuffer- 
able, and shall not go unpunished. The account you 
enclosed of the method of receiving the beef, I suppose, 
is customary ; but for want of knowledge in those affairs, 
I can neither applaud nor condemn it. 

The Governor did not seem inclined to promote the 
removal of the fort; however, the Committee have 
lodged a discretionary power in my hands, and have 
resolved to pay for all extraordinary labor. I would, 
therefore, have as little labor lost at Fort Cumberland 
as possible ; at least, until I come up, which will be very 
shortly, my stay here being only for a few days, in order 
to receive recruits, and hurry up the stores to Win- 
chester. 

I believe those, who say Governor Sharpe is to com- 
mand, can only wish it. I do not know that General 
Shirley has a power to appoint a chief to our forces, 
to regulars he may. As to that affair of turning the 
store-house into a dwelling-room, I do not know what 
better answer to give, than saying, that this is one 
among the many instances, which might be offered, of 
the inconvenience of having the fort in Maryland. As 
soon as I hear from Governor Shirley, which is hourly 
expected, I can then send a more determinate answer. 

There has been such total negligence among the re- 
cruiting officers in general, such disregard of the service

they were employed in, and such idle proceedings, that 
I am determined to send out none until we all meet, 
when each officer shall have his own men, and have 
only this alternative, either to complete his number, or 
lose his commission. Several officers have been out six 
weeks, or two months, without getting a man, spending 
their time in all the gayety of pleasurable mirth, with 
their relations and friends ; not attempting, nor having 
possible chance to recruit any but those, who, out of 
their inclination to the service, will proffer themselves. 

I should be glad to have ten or twelve wagons sent 
to this place. Salt enough may be had here to load that 
number, and it is obtained upon easier terms than at 
Fredericksburg, by sixpence or eight pence per bushel. 
Those stores at Watkins's Ferry should be hurried up 
as fast as the water affords opportunities, if it were only 
to prevent disputes. 

If the paymaster is at Winchester, and not on his 
way to Fort Dinwiddie, order him down here immedi- 
ately. If he should be going with pay to Captain Hogg, 
he is to proceed with despatch ; but if he is at Fort 
Cumberland, order him down to Winchester, to wait 
there until I arrive. I am, &c. * 

* The following letter from Colonel Gage to Colonel Washington may 
be thought worthy of preservation, considering the relations that subsisted 
between these two persons twenty years afterwards, when the former 
commanded the British forces in Boston, and the latter was at the head of 
the American army at Cambridge.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 5 December, 1755. 

SIR, 

I have sent the bearer, Captain John Mercer (who 
has accounts to settle with the Committee), to the 
treasurer for the balance of the ten thousand pounds ; 
and to acquaint your Honor, that, meeting with letters 
at Fredericksburg, as I returned from Williamsburg, 
informing me that all was peaceable above, and that 
nothing was so immediately wanting as salt, I got what 
I could at that place, and hastened on hither to engage 
more, to receive the recruits expected in, and to wait 
the arrival of the vessel with arms from James River, in 
order to forward them up with the greater despatch. 
The vessel is not yet arrived. 

I have impatiently waited to hear the result of your 
letter to General Shirley, and wish that the delays may 
not prove ominous. In that case, I shall not know how 
to act ; for I can never submit to the command of Cap- 
tain Dagworthy, since you have honored me with the 
command of the Virginia regiment. 

The country has sustained inconceivable losses, by 
delaying the commissaries at Williamsburg. Many of 

those merciless barbarians, that have ravaged your frontiers, are repulsed 
and driven back to their woods. The account we have received of their 
barbarities gave me infinite concern, when I reflected on the many poor 
families that I had seen in that part of the world, who had been massacred 
by those murderers. Nothing would give me greater pleasure, than to 
hear they had met with the fate their villanies deserve, and which I hope 
they will sooner or later meet with. 

" General Johnson has finished his fort at Lake George, which will be 
garrisoned by the New England forces, as well as Fort Edward. There 
is an end of this campaign, and nothing remains now but to prepare for 
the next, which I hope will be more successful than the last I sincerely 
wish you all health and happiness, and beg you will believe me, dear 
Sir, &c.

the Carolina beeves are dead, through absolute poverty, 
and the chief part of them too poor to slaughter. 

We are at a loss how to act, for want of the mutiny 
bill ; and I should be obliged to your Honor, if you will 
have fifty or a hundred printed, and sent by the bearer. 
There is a clause in that bill, which, if you are not kind 
enough to obviate it, will prevent entirely the good in- 
tention of it, that is, delaying the execution of sentences, 
until your Honor shall be made acquainted with the 
proceedings of the court. This, at times when there is 
the greatest occasion for examples, will be morally im- 
possible ; I mean, while we are on our march, perhaps 
near the Ohio, when none but strong parties can pass 
with safety. At all times it must be attended with 
great expense, trouble, and inconvenience. I repre- 
sented this to Colonel Corbin, and some other gentlemen 
of the Council, when I was down, who said that the 
objection would be removed, by your giving blank war- 
rants, to be filled up as occasion should require. This 
would effectually remedy all those evils, and put things 
in their proper channel. 

We suffer greatly for want of kettles; those sent 
from below, being tin, are of short duration. We shall, 
also, in a little time, suffer as much for the want of cloth- 
ing ; none can be got in these parts. Shoes and stock- 
ings we have, and can get more if wanted, but nothing 
else. I wish your Honor would direct what is to be 
done in these cases; and that you would be kind 
enough to desire the treasurer to send some part of the 
money in gold and silver. Were this done, we might 
often get necessaries for the regiment in Maryland, or 
Pennsylvania, when they cannot be had here. But with 
our money it is impossible ; our paper not passing there. 

The recruiting service goes on extremely slow. Yes- 
terday being a day appointed for the rendezvous at this 



PARTI.J THE FRENCH WAR. 119 

place, there came in ten officers with twenty men only. 
If I had any other than paper money, and you approved 
of it, I would send to Pennsylvania and the borders of 
Carolina. I am confident men might be had there. 
Your Honor never having given any particular directions 
about the provisions, I should be glad to know, whether 
you would have more laid in, than will serve for twelve 
hundred men, that I may give orders accordingly. 

As I cannot now conceive, that any great danger can 
be apprehended at Fort Cumberland this winter, I am 
sensible, that my constant attendance there cannot be 
so serviceable, as riding from place to place, making the 
proper dispositions, and seeing that all our necessaries 
are forwarded up with despatch. I therefore think it 
advisable to inform your Honor of it, hoping it will cor- 
respond with your own opinion. 

Captain Mercer's pay as aid-de-camp seems yet 
doubtful. I should be pleased if you would fix it ; as 
also Captain Stewart's. If Captain Stewart's is in- 
creased, I suppose all the officers belonging to the light- 
horse will expect to have theirs augmented also. Colonel 
Stephen, in a late letter, discovered an inclination to go 
to the Creek and Cherokee Indians this winter. I told 
him where to apply, if he had any such thoughts. I 
believe, on so useful a business, he might be spared 
until the spring. 

If you think proper to order the act of Assembly for ap- 
prehending deserters, and against harbouring them, to be 
published every Sunday in each parish church, until the 
people are made acquainted with the law, it would have 
a very good effect. The commonalty in general err 
more through ignorance than design. Few of them 
know that such a law exists, and there is no other cer- 
tain way of bringing it to their knowledge. A great 
many of the men, that once belonged to our companies,

and deserted from the regiments into which they were 
drafted, would now gladly return, if they could be sure 
of indemnity. If you would be kind enough to intimate 
this to General Shirley, or the colonels of those regi- 
ments, it would be of service to us. Without leave, we 
dare not receive them. I am, &,c. 




TO COLONEL ADAM STEPHEN. 

Winchester, 28 December, 1755. 

SIR, 

Captain John Mercer only returned last night from 
Williamsburg, and brings no satisfactory answers to any 
thing I questioned the Governor upon. 

The express, that was sent to General Shirley, has 
returned without seeing him. However, the Governor 
writes that he expects answers to his letters by Colonel 
Hunter, who is now at New York, and waits the arrival 
of the General at that place. The Governor is very 
strongly of opinion, that Captain Dag worthy has no 
right to contend for the command ; and in his letter he 
says, after mentioning the return of the express, and his 
expectation of satisfactory letters, " But I am of opinion 
you might have obviated the inconsistent dispute with 
Captain Dagworthy, by asking him if he did not com- 
mand a provincial company by virtue of Governor 
Sharpe's commission ; as that he had formerly from his 
Majesty now ceases, as he is not on the half-pay list. 
If so, the method you are to take is very obvious, as 
your commission from me is greater than what he has." 
And in Williamsburg, when I was down there, both he 
and Colonel Fitzhugh told me, that Dagworthy could 
have no more pretensions to command me, or either of 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 121 

the field-officers of the Virginia regiment, than we have 
to command General Shirley; and further gave it as 
their opinion, that as Dagworthy's was only a botched- 
up commission at best, and as he commanded a provin- 
cial company, and by virtue of a governor's commission, 
he ought to be arrested for his presumption. They say, 
allowing his commission from the King to be valid, yet, 
as he is not there by order of his Majesty, he can have 
no better pretensions to assume the command, than a 
visiting half-pay officer, who transiently passes through 
the camp. 

I wish you would sound him on this head, and hear 
how he will answer these things, and let me know when 
you come down, which I desire may be immediately, as 
I want much to consult you upon several accounts. The 
paymaster, and commissary, if not very much engaged, 
must accompany you. Desire both to have their ac- 
counts settled, and brought with them, as that is neces- 
sary before I can give more money. 

I have sent you one of the mutiny bills, which I 
received from below, but I believe it is necessary, as we 
still want the power, to postpone trials until after your 
return. 

Enclosed is a commission for Captain Waggener, 
which I have neglected giving before. Desire him, as 
the command upon your leaving the place will devolve 
upon him, to be very circumspect in his duty, and to 
see that the troops are duly drawn out and trained to 
their exercise, and practised to bush-fighting. 

As I expect in a very few days to have the pleasure 
of seeing you, I shall only add, I am, &c.

TO ROBERT HUNTER MORRIS, GOVERNOR OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 

Winchester, 5 January, 1756. 

SIR, 

I am sorry it has not been in my power to acknowl- 
edge the receipt of yours until now. At the time your 
letter came to Winchester, I was at Williamsburg ;. be- 
fore I got back, it was conveyed thither ; and so from 
place to place it has been tossing almost until this time. 

There is nothing more necessary than good intelli- 
gence to frustrate a designing enemy, and nothing that 
requires greater pains to obtain. I shall, therefore, 
cheerfully come into any measures you can propose to 
settle a correspondence for this salutary end ; and you 
may depend upon receiving (when the provinces are 
threatened) the earliest and best intelligence I can 
procure. 

I sympathized in a general concern to see the inac- 
tivity of your province in a time of imminent danger ; 
but am pleased to find, that a feeling sense of wrongs 
has roused the spirit of your martial Assembly to vote 
a sum, which, with your judicious application, will turn 
to a general good. * 

* The warm contest between the Governor and Assembly of Pennsyl- 
vania, respecting the mode of raising money, had hitherto prevented any 
efficient aid being rendered by that colony for the public service. As the 
Proprietaries owned large estates in the province, the Assembly insisted 
that these estates should be taxed for the common defence, in the same 
proportion as the estates of the inhabitants, and reported all their bills ac- 
cordingly. Prohibited by his instructions, the Governor had no power to 
sanction such bills. In a case so manifestly just, and involving a principle 
of great importance, the Assembly would not yield, and no money was 
granted. 

At last, when the news of Braddock's defeat reached England, the Pro- 
prietaries, alarmed at the progress of the enemy, or, as Dr. Franklin has 
said, " intimidated by the clamor raised against them for their meanness 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 123 

We took some pretty vigorous measures to collect a 
force upon our frontiers, upon the first alarm, which has 
kept us peaceable ever since. How long this may last 
is uncertain, since that force, which consisted of militia, 
is disbanded, and the recruiting service almost stag- 
nated. 

If you propose to levy troops, and their destination is 
not a secret, I should be favored w r ere I let into the 
scheme, that we may act conjunctly, so far as the na- 
ture of things will admit. 

Pray direct to me at Alexandria, to which place I 
intend to go in about ten days. I am, &,c. 



ADDRESS TO THE OFFICERS OF THE VIRGINIA 
REGIMENT.* 

8 January, 1756. 

This timely warning .of the effects of misbehaviour 

and injustice in giving their governor such instructions," ordered the 
receiver-general to add five thousand pounds to such sums, as the Assem- 
bly should grant for the security of the province. When this was made 
known to the House, a new bill was formed, granting sixty thousand pounds 
for the use of the crown, with a clause exempting the proprietary estates 
from the tax. Votes of the Pennsylvania Assembly for JVbvewifier, 1755. 

In the May preceding, the Assembly had given fifteen hundred pounds for 
the King's use, by an order appropriating funds then within their control. 
Five thousand pounds of this money were applied to victualling the King's 
troops in Virginia, and ten thousand pounds to procuring and transporting 
provisions for the Massachusetts troops engaged in the King's service. 

At the same time that the above grant of sixty thousand pounds was 
made, a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia was 
drafted by Franklin, which, as he says, passed through the House with 
little difficulty, as the Quakers were left at liberty. Several companies 
were organized, but none ever joined the Virginians in any expedition 
against the Indians. The money was chiefly expended in building forts 
on the Pennsylvania frontiers, .under the superintendence of Franklin, who 
was commissioned for that purpose by the Governor. See Franklin's 
Works, Vol. I. p. 153.

will, I hope, be instrumental in animating the younger 
officers to a laudable emulation in the service of their 
country. Not that I apprehend any of them can be 
guilty of offences of this nature, but there are many 
other misdemeanors, that will, without due circumspec- 
tion, gain upon inactive minds, and produce conse- 
quences equally disgraceful. 

I would, therefore, earnestly recommend, in every 
point of duty, willingness to undertake, and intrepid 
resolution to execute. Remember, that actions, and 
not the commission, make the officer, and that more is 
expected from him, than the title. Do not forget, that 
there ought to be a time appropriated to attain knowl- 
edge, as well as to indulge in pleasure. And as we 
now have no opportunities to improve from example, let 
us read for this desirable end. Eland's and other trea- 
tises will give the proper information. 

I think it my duty, gentlemen, as I have the honor to 
preside over you, to give this friendly admonition ; es- 
pecially since I am determined, as far as my small 
experience, my abilities, and interest in the service may 
dictate, to observe the strictest discipline. On the other 
hand, you may as certainly depend upon having rigid 
justice administered to all, and that I shall make it the 
most agreeable part of my duty to study merit, and re- 
ward the brave and deserving. I assure, you, gentlemen, 
that partiality shall never bias my conduct, nor shall 
prejudice injure any ; but, throughout the whole tenor 
of my proceedings, I shall endeavour, as far as I am 
able, to reward and punish, without the least departure 
from equity. 

communicating this sentence, the commander addressed to the officers 
generally the above remarks and admonition.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 14 January, 1756. 

SIR, 

Major Lewis, being at Winchester when your letter 
came to hand, was immediately despatched to Augusta, 
to take upon him the command of the troops destined 
against the Shawanese Town ; * with orders to follow 
such directions as he should receive from you. This 
scheme I am apprehensive will prove abortive, as we 
are told that those Indians are removed up the river, 
into the neighbourhood of Fort Duquesne. 

I have given all necessary orders for- training the men 
to a proper use of their arms, and the method of Indian 
fighting, and hope in a little time to make them expert. 
I should be glad to have your Honor's express com- 
mands, either to prepare for taking the field, or for 
guarding our frontiers in the spring, because the steps 
for these two operations are very different. I have 
already built two forts on Patterson's Creek, which have 
caused the chief part of the inhabitants to return to their 
plantations ; and have now ordered Captain Waggener 
with sixty men to build and garrison two others, at 
places I have pointed out high up the South Branch, 
which will be a means of securing near a hundred miles 
of our frontiers, exclusive of the command at Fort Din- 
widdie, on Jackson's River. And, indeed, without a 
much greater number of men than we have a prospect 
of raising, I do not see how it is possible to think of 
passing the mountains, or acting more than defensively. 
This seems to be the full determination of the Pennsyl- 
vanians; so that there can be no hope of assistance 
from that quarter. If we only act defensively, I would 
most earnestly recommend the building of a strong fort

126 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jErr. 23. 

at some convenient place in Virginia, as that in Mary- 
land [Fort Cumberland], not to say any thing of its 
situation, which is extremely bad, will ever be an eye- 
sore to this colony, and attended with more inconven- 
iences than it is possible to enumerate. One instance 
of this I have taken notice of, in a letter that accom- 
panies this, and many more I could recite, were it 
necessary. 

If we take the field, there is not time to carry on a 
work of this kind, but we should immediately set about 
engaging wagons, horses, forage, pack-saddles, &c. 
And here I cannot help remarking, that I believe it will 
be impossible to get wagons or horses sufficient, unless 
the old score is paid off; as the people are really ruined 
for want of their money, and complain justly of their 
grievances. 

I represented in my last the inconveniences of the 
late act of Assembly, which obliges us first to send to 
your Honor for a commission to hold general courts- 
martial, and then to delay execution until a warrant can 
be had from Williamsburg. I hope you will take the 
thing into consideration. We have several deserters 
now on hand, whom I have taken by rigorous measures, 
and who should be made examples to others, as this 
practice is continued with greater spirit than ever. 

Unless clothing is soon provided, the men will be unfit 
for any kind of service. And I know of no expedient to 
procure clothes, but by sending to the northward, as 
cloth cannot be had here. I left, among other returns, 
an exact account of the clothing at every place, when I 
was in Williamsburg. I shall not care to lay in pro- 
visions for more than a thousand men, unless I have 
your orders. We have put out such of the beeves as 
were unfit for slaughtering. If they survive the winter, 
they may be useful in the summer.

Ensign Poison has received a commission in Colonel 
Gage's regiment, and has thus left a vacancy, which, 
with your approbation, will be filled by Mr. Dennis 
M c Carty, whom you once appointed a captain. He has 
continued a volunteer ever since, and has recruited sev- 
eral men. I hope your Honor will allow me the liberty, 
as you once promised, of filling up the vacancies, as 
they happen, with the volunteers, who serve with that 
expectation. We have several with us, who appear to 
be very deserving young gentlemen. I shall observe

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 14 January, 1756. 

SIR, 

When I was down, the Committee among other things 
resolved, that the Maryland and Carolina companies 
should not be supported with our provisions. This re- 
solve, I think, met with your approbation ; upon which 
I wrote to Colonel Stephen, desiring him to acquaint 
Captain Dagworthy therewith, who paid slight regard to 
it, saying they were in the King's garrison, and all the 
troops had an equal right to draw provisions with us, by 
his order, as commanding officer, and that we, after the 
provisions were put there, had no power to remove 
them without his leave. I would, therefore, request 
your Honor's peremptory orders what to do in this case, 
as I do not care to act without instructions, lest it should

appear to proceed from pique and resentment at having 
the command disputed. This is one among the num- 
berless inconveniences of the fort being in Maryland. 
Captain Dagworthy, I dare venture to affirm, is encour- 
aged to say this by Governor Sharpe, who we know 
has written him to keep the command. With this Cap- 
tain Dagworthy himself acquainted Colonel Stephen. 

As I have not yet heard how General Shirley has 
answered your request, I fear for the success of it, es- 
pecially as it is next to an impossibility (since Governor 
Sharpe has been there to plead Captain Dagworthy's 
cause) to make the General acquainted, by writing, with 
the nature of the dispute. The officers have drawn up a 
memorial to be presented to the General, and, that it 
may be properly strengthened, they humbly beg your 
solicitation to have us put upon the establishment, as we 
have certain advices that it is in his power. This would 
at once put an end to contention, which is the root 
of evil, and destructive to the best operations ; and it 
w r ould turn all our movements into a free and easy 
channel. 

They have urged it to me, in the warmest manner, 
to appear personally before the General for that end. 
This I would gladly do, even at this disagreeable*season, 
if I had your permission ; which I the more freely ask, 
since I am determined to resign a commission, which 
you were generously pleased to offer me, and for which 
I shall always retain a grateful sense, rather than submit 
to the command of a person, who has not such superla- 
tive merit as to balance the inequality of rank. How- 
ever, he adheres to what he calls his rights, in which 
I know he is supported by Governor Sharpe. He says, 
that he has no commission from the province of Mary- 
land, but acts by virtue of that from the King ; that this 
was the condition of his engaging in the Maryland ser- 



PART!.] . THE FRENCH WAR. 129 

vice; and that, when he was sent up there the 1st of 
last October, he was ordered by Governor Sharpe and 
Sir John St. Clair not to give up his right. To my 
certain knowledge his rank was disputed before General 
Braddock, who gave it in his favor ; and he accordingly 
took place of every captain upon the expedition, except 
Captain James Mercer and Captain Rutherford, whose 
commissions were older than his ; so that I should not 
by any means choose to act, as your Honor hinted in 
your last, lest I should be called to an account myself. * 

I have, during my stay at Winchester from the 20th 
of December to this time, disposed of all the men and 
officers, that are not recruiting, and can be spared from 
the fort, in the best manner I could for the defence of 
the inhabitants, and they will need no further orders till 
I could return. And the recruiting officers are allowed 
till the 1st of March to repair to their rendezvous, which 
leaves at present nothing to do at the fort, but to train 
and discipline the men, and prepare and salt the pro- 
visions. For the better perfecting both these, I have 
left full and clear directions. 

Besides, in other respects, I think my going to the 
northward might be of service, as I should thereby be- 
come acquainted with the plan of operations, so far as it 
may be thought proper to be communicated. 

Should you comply with my request, I would thank 
you for such letters, as you think may enforce the peti- 
tion to the General, or any of the governors in my way. 
I am, &c.

TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL STEPHEN. 

Alexandria, 1 February, 1756. 

SIR, 

Looking upon our affairs at this critical juncture to be 
of such importance, and having a personal acquaintance 
with General Shirley, which I thought might add some 
weight to the strength of our memorial, I solicited leave, 
which is obtained, to visit him in person. I shall ac- 
cordingly set out in two days for Boston, having pro- 
cured letters from the Governor. You may depend I 
shall leave no stone unturned for this salutary end ; and, 
I think, if reason, justice, and every equitable right can 
claim attention, we deserve to be heard. 

As I have taken the fatigue of this tedious journey 
upon myself, which I had never thought of until I left 
Winchester, I hope you will conduct every thing in my 
absence for the interest and honor of the service. And 
I must exhort you in the most earnest manner to strict 
discipline and due exercise of arms. 

You may tell Mr. Livingston from me, that, if the 
soldiers are not skilled in arms equal to what may rea- 
sonably be expected, he most assuredly shall answer 
for it at my return. And I must frankly tell you, that I 
also expect to find them expert at bush-fighting. You 
are to order a particular account to be taken of the pro- 
visions, that are delivered to the Maryland and Carolina 
companies by the commissary. 

The Governor seems determined to make the officers 
comply with the terms of holding their commissions, or 
forfeit them. He approves of Dekeyser's suspension, 
and orders, that he shall not be admitted into the camp. 
He seems uneasy at what I own gives me much con- 
cern, namely, that gaming is introduced into the camp. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 131 

I am ordered to discourage it, and must desire that you 
will intimate the same. 

As money may be wanted for paying the troops, and 
other incidental charges, order the paymaster down to 
Alexandria, where he may receive of Mr. Kirkpatrick 
the sum requisite. 

I think of nothing else at present ; so, with once more 
exhorting you to strict observation of discipline, I con- 
clude, yours, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 2 February, 1756. 

SIR, 

I can but return my very hearty thanks for your kind 
condescension in suffering me to wait upon General 
Shirley, as I am very well assured it was done with the 
intention to favor my suit. 

There is as yet an unanswerable argument against our 
taking the field, which I forgot to mention in my last; 
that is, the want of a train of artillery, and, what is full 
as necessary, engineers to conduct the affair, if we hope 
to approach Fort Duquesne. 

By the advices, which we have received hitherto from 
the northward, the Pennsylvanians are determined to 
act defensively. For that purpose they have posted 
their newly raised levies upon their frontiers at different 
passes, and have received the additional strength and 
favor of a detachment or two from the regulars. 

I have ordered, besides the forts that are built, and 
now building, that a road which I had reconnoitred, 
and which proves nearer and better, should be immedi- 
ately opened for the more easy transportation of stores 
from Winchester to Fort Cumberland ; so there is not 



132

[JET. 23. 



the least fear that the soldiers will be corrupted through 
idleness. 

The commission for calling general courts -martial ap- 
pears to me imperfect, notwithstanding it was drawn by 
the attorney-general, as it rather, by the words, appoints 
me, or whomever it is directed to, president of the said 
court, than invests a power to hold a court-martial with- 
out its being first ordered by you ; whereas, the com- 
mission should empower the officer to appoint a court, 
of which he is to be president. But as I hope there 
will be little occasion for any, until I come back, it may 
be deferred until then, when that and other things, I 
trust, will be properly settled. 

I have always, so far as was in my power, endeav- 
oured to discourage gaming in the camp ; and always 
shall while I have the honor to preside there. 

I have delivered the skipper to Mr. Carlyle, who pro- 
poses, in order to save expense, to send him round by 
water, in the vessel that brought up the stores. The 
evidences in this affair will be Mr. Carlyle, Ensigns 
Buckner and Deane, and one of the men now in the 
vessel. 

I cannot help observing, that your Honor, if you have 
not seen the clothes lately sent up, has been imposed 
upon by the contractors, for they are really unfit for use; 
or, at least, will soon be so. 

I have nothing in particular to add, but to assure you, 
that I shall use my utmost diligence in the prosecution 
of my journey and pretensions, and that I am, with very 
great esteem, your Honor's, &c. * .

TO GOVERNOR D1NWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 7 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

I arrived here yesterday, and think it advisable to 
despatch an express (notwithstanding I hear two or 
three are already sent down) to inform you of the un- 
happy situation of affairs in this quarter. The enemy 
have returned in greater numbers, committed several 
murders not far from Winchester, and even are so dar- 
ing as to attack our forts in open day, as you may see 
by the enclosed letters and papers. Many of the in- 
habitants are in a miserable situation by their losses, and 

he continued ten days, mixing constantly in the society of the town, and 
attending with interest to the proceedings of the legislature of Massachu- 
setts, then engaged in affairs of great moment respecting the requisite 
aids for promoting the grand scheme of military operations, recently agreed 
upon by a council of several governors assembled at New York. He also 
visited Castle William, and other objects worthy of a stranger's notice. 

In the purpose of his mission he was successful, as may be seen by the 
following order, given under the hand of General Shirley. 

" Boston, 5 March, 1756. 

" Governor Dinwiddie, at the instance of Colonel Washington, having 
referred to me concerning the right of command between him and Captain 
Dagworthy, and desiring that I should determine it, I do therefore give it 
as my opinion, that Captain Dagworthy, who now acts under a commission 
from the Governor of Maryland, and where there are no regular troops 
joined, can only take rank as a provincial captain, and of course is under 
the command of all provincial field-officers ; and, in case it should happen, 
that Colonel Washington and Captain Dagworthy should join at Fort 
Cumberland, it is my order that Colonel Washington shall take the 
command. 

W. SHIRLEY." 

As Soon as he returned from this tour, he proceeded onward to Wil- 
liamsburg. He had been there but a short time, when an express arrived 
with intelligence, that the French and Indians had broken into the frontier 
settlements, murdered several of the inhabitants, and excited great alarm 
in all that region. Upon hearing this news, he hastened back to his head- 
quarters at Winchester. 

VOL II. L 



134 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. ^T. 24. 



so apprehensive of danger, that, I believe, unless a stop 
is put to the depredations of the Indians, the Blue Ridge 
will soon become our frontier. 

I find it impossible to continue on to Fort Cumber- 
land, until a body of men can be raised. I have advised 
with Lord Fairfax, and other officers of the militia, who 
have ordered each captain to call a private muster, and 
to read the exhortation enclosed (for orders are no 
longer regarded in this county), in hopes that this expe- 
dient may meet with the desired success. If it should, 
I shall, with such men as are ordered from Fort Cum- 
berland to join these, scour the woods and suspected 
places, in all the mountains and valleys, on this part of 
our frontiers ; and doubt not but I shall fall in with the 
Indians and their more cruel associates. I hope the 
present emergency of affairs, assisted by such good 
news as the Assembly may by this time have received 
from England, and from the Commissioners, will deter- 
mine them to take vigorous measures for their own and 
country's safety, and no longer depend on an uncertain 
way of raising men for their own protection. However 
absurd it may appear, it is nevertheless certain, that five 
hundred Indians have it more in their power to annoy 
the inhabitants, than ten times their number of regulars. 
Besides the advantageous way they have of fighting 
in the woods, their cunning and craft, their activity 
and patient sufferings, are not to be equalled. They 
prowl about like wolves, and, like them, do their mis- 
chief by stealth. They depend upon their dexterity in 
hunting and upon the cattle of the inhabitants for pro- 
visions. For these reasons, I own, I do not think it 
unworthy of the notice of the legislature to compel the 
inhabitants (if a general war is likely to ensue, and 
things are to continue in this unhappy situation for any 
time,) to live in townships, working at each other's farms 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 135 

by turns, and to drive their cattle into the thickly settled 
parts of the country. Were this done, they could not 
be cut off by small parties, and large ones could not 
subsist without provisions.* 

It seemed to be the sentiment of the House of Bur- 
gesses when I was down, that a chain of forts should 
be erected upon our frontiers, for the defence of the 
people. This expedient, in my opinion, without an in- 
conceivable number of men, will never answer their 
expectations. 

I doubt not but your Honor has had a particular ac- 
count of Major Lewis's unsuccessful attempt to get to 
the Shawanese Town. It was an expedition, from 
which, on account of the length of the march, I always 
had little hope, and often expressed my uneasy appre- 
hensions on that head. But since they are returned, 
with the Indians that accompanied them, I think it 
would be a very happy step to prevail upon the latter 
to proceed as far as Fort Cumberland. It is in their 
power to be of infinite use to us ; and without Indians, 
we shall never be able to cope with those cruel foes to 
our country.f 

I would therefore beg leave to recommend in a very 

* Colonel Washington wrote a similar account to the Speaker of the 
House of Burgesses, and added; "I would beg leave to recommend, that 
more men should be drafted, than are necessary to complete our numbers, 
and then, out of the whole, our complement may be chosen of active and 
resolute men. To encourage such men to go with the less reluctance, I 
think it not amiss, that they should serve only eighteen or twenty months, 
and then be discharged. Twenty months will embrace two full cam- 
paigns, which will, I apprehend, bring matters to a crisis one way or 
another." 

f Major Lewis's party suffered greatly on this expedition. The rivers 
were so much swoln by the rains and melting snow, that they were un- 
able to reach the Shawanese Town ; and after being six weeks in the 
woods, having lost several canoes with provisions and ammunition, they 
were reduced nearly to a state of starvation, and obliged to kill their 
horses for food.

earnest manner, that your Honor would send an express 
to them immediately for this desirable end. I should 
have done it myself, but was uncertain whether it might 
prove agreeable or not. I also hope you will order 
Major Lewis to secure his guides, as I understand he 

attributes all his misfortunes to their misconduct. Such 



offences should meet with adequate punishment, or else 
we may ever be misled by designing villains. I am 
your Honor's, &c. 

P. S. Since writing the above, Mr. Paris, who com- 
manded a party, is returned. He relates, that, upon the 
North River, he fell in with a small body of Indians whom 
he engaged, and, after a contest of half an hour, put 
them to flight. Monsieur Donville, commander of the 
party, was killed and scalped, and his instructions found 
about him, which I enclose. We had one man killed, 
and two wounded. Mr. Paris sent the scalp by Jenkins; 
and I hope, although it is not an Indian's, they will meet 
with an adequate reward. The whole party jointly 
claim the reward, no person pretending solely to assume 
the merit. * 



* At this time there was no law in Virginia fixing the reward for scalps, 
and it was probably left to the discretion of the governor. Shortly after- 
wards a reward of ten pounds was established by law, for every hostile 
Indian taken prisoner or killed. This law was to remain in force during 
the war. It applied only to Indians, and not to enemies of any other de- 
scription. In Maryland at one time the bounty for each Indian prisoner, 
or scalp, taken within the province, was as high as fifty pounds. But this 
allowance was not made to soldiers in public pay. Hening's Statutes at 
Large, Vol. VI. p. 551. Acts of the Maryland Assembly, September, 1756. 

From early times it had been customary to offer high bounties for ser- 
vice in Indian wars. The Commissioners of the United Colonies of Mas- 
sachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut, in their instructions to Major 
Church, September 18th, 1689, confirm, that the soldiers should have " the 
benefit of the captives, and all lawful plunder, and the reward of eight 
pounds per head for every fighting Indian man slain by them, over and 
above their stated wages." By the "benefit of the captives" is here

Your Honor may in some measure penetrate into the 
daring designs of the French by their instructions, in 
which orders are given to burn, if possible, our magazine 
at Conococheague, a place that is in the midst of a 
thickly settled country. 

I have ordered the party there to be made as strong 
as time and our present circumstances will permit, lest 
they should attempt to execute the instructions of 
Dumas. * I have also ordered up an officer and twenty 
recruits to assist Joseph Edwards, and the 'people on 
those waters. The inhabitants of this town are under 
dreadful apprehensions of an attack, and all the roads 
between this and Fort Cumberland are much infested. 
As I apprehend you will be obliged to draft men, I hope 
care will be taken, that none shall be chosen but active, 
resolute men, who are practised in the use of arms, 
and are marksmen.

"esterday was the appointed time for a. general rendez- 
vous of all, who were willing to accompany me for that 
desirable end, and only fifteen appeared ; so that I find 
myself reduced to the further necessity of waiting at 
this place a few days longer, until the arrival of a party 
ordered from Fort Cumberland to escort me up ; the 
roads being so infested, that none but hunters, who 
travel the woods by night, can pass in safety. 

I have done every thing in my power to quiet the 
minds of the inhabitants, by detaching all the men, that 
I have any command over, to the places most exposed. 
There have also been large detachments from Fort 
Cumberland in pursuit of the enemy these ten days 
past ; yet nothing, I fear, will prevent the people from 
abandoning their dwellings, and flying with the utmost 
precipitation. 

No murder has been committed since I came up ; but 
the express, whom I sent to Colonel Stephen, notwith- 
standing he was an excellent woodsman, and a very 
active fellow, was fired upon five times at a place called 
the Flats, within six miles of Fort Cumberland. He 
had several bullets through his clothes, and his horse 
shot under him, yet he made his escape. 

By a letter from a gentleman in Williamsburg we are 
informed, that the Assembly have generously given the 



ordered to go and observe the motions of the enemy in the neighbourhood 
of Fort Cumberland. He will endeavour to harass their convoys, and 
burn their magazines at Conococheague, should this be practicable. He 
must use every effort to take prisoners, who may confirm what we already 
know of the enemy's designs. The Sieur Donville will employ all his 
talents, and all his credit, to prevent the savages from committing any 
cruelties upon those, who may fall into their hands. Honor and humanity 
ought, in tin's respect, to serve as our guide.

further sum of twenty thousand pounds, and voted the 
augmenting of our forces to two thousand men, from 
whom, under good regulations, we may have some ex- 
pectations, if they are properly appointed. For this 
purpose, as I have not heard your Honor offer your 
opinion, I have been free enough to propose a scheme, 
which is now enclosed. The plan is to have the whole 
two thousand formed into one regiment consisting of 
two battalions, of ten companies each, with five field- 
officers, each of whom to have a company ; and every 
other company to consist of one captain, two lieutenants, 
one ensign, four sergeants, four corporals, two drum- 
mers, and eighty-seven private men. This will save to 
the country the annual sum of five thousand and six 
pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight pence, and we shall 
be better established, and appointed more after the 
British manner, than we now can, or should be, if 
formed into two regiments, or into one regiment with 
only fifty men in a company. And I humbly conceive, 
where we can pattern after our mother country upon as 
easy terms as pursuing plans of our own, that we should 
at least pay that deference to her judgment and expe- 
rience. 

The country will save the pay of many commissioned, 
as well as non-commissioned officers, who are the per- 
sons that enhance the expenses. For, the whole annual 
pay of the two thousand men, including all the staff- 
officers, and other commissioned officers, sergeants, cor- 
porals, drummers, and private men, amounts only to 
thirty-four thousand one hundred and forty-five pounds 
ten shillings; whereas, were they formed into regi- 
ments, or into one regiment of fifty in a company, (but 
that would be quite incongruous,) the expense would 
amount to thirty -nine thousand one hundred and fifty- 
two pounds, six shillings, and eight pence, which makes 



140 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. f^E T . 24 

the aforesaid difference. Then, again, we do not al- 
low companies to our field-officers, which I believe 
is the only instance that can be given in which they 
are not, and this makes the difference of three captains' 
pay. 

I have been free enough to offer my opinion very 
candidly, and in that light I hope it will be received, 
though it may meet with your Honor's disapprobation. 
I had no other motive in proposing this scheme, than 
the pleasing hope of serving my country. If I have mis- 
taken the means, I am sorry for it, and beg pardon for 
my presumption. 

As I am convinced, that no other method can be 
used to raise two thousand men, but by drafting, I hope 
to be excused, when I again repeat, that great care 
should be observed in choosing active marksmen. The 
manifest inferiority of inactive persons, unused to arms, 
in this kind of service, (although equal in numbers,) to 
men who have practised hunting, is inconceivable. The 
chance against them is more than two to one. Another 
thing I hope will merit the consideration of the Assem- 
bly, and that is, that they will put all such men as are 
raised for the expedition in actual pay, and under the 
same discipline as ours at present ; otherwise, I am very 
well convinced their good intentions will prove abortive, 
and all the drafts will very soon quit the service. 

I do not conceive it to be a hardship to put even 
drafts under martial law, if they are only taken for a 
certain time, which I could wish to be the case, as I 
thereby hope for better men. 

I have the honor to be, with high consideration, &c.

* 

Winchester, 18 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

It gave me infinite concern to find in yours by Gov- 
ernor Innes, that any representations should inflame the 
Assembly against the Virginia regiment, or give cause 
to suspect the morality and good behaviour of the offi- 
cers. How far any of the individuals may have deserved 
such reflections, I will not take upon me to determine, 
but this I am certain of, and can call my conscience, and 
what, I suppose, will be a still more demonstrative proof 
in the eyes of the world, my orders, to witness how 
much I have, both by threats and persuasive means, en- 
deavoured to discountenance gaming, drinking, swearing, 
and irregularities of every other kind ; while I have, on 
the other hand, practised every artifice to inspire a lau- 
dable emulation in the officers for the service of their 
country, and to encourage the soldiers in the unerring 
exercise of their duty. How far I have failed in this 
desirable end, I cannot pretend to say. But it is never- 
theless a point, which does in my opinion merit some 
scrutiny, before it meets with a final condemnation. 
Yet I will not undertake to vouch for the conduct of 
many of the officers, as I know there are some, who 
have the seeds of idleness very strongly implanted in 
their natures ; and I also know, that the unhappy differ- 
ence about the command, which has kept me from Fort 
Cumberland, has consequently prevented me from en- 
forcing the orders, which I never failed to send. 

However, if I continue in the service, I shall take care 
to act with a little more rigor, than has hitherto been 
practised, since I find it so necessary. 

I wrote your Honor in my last how unsuccessfully we 
attempted to raise the militia, and that I was reduced to

the necessity of waiting here for the arrival of an escort 
from Fort Cumberland. The garrison there is barely 
manned. The rest are out on parties ; yet the Indians 
continue to haunt the roads, and pick up straggling per- 
sons. This you may see by the enclosed from Captain 
John Mercer, who, being out with a scouting party 
of one hundred men, has been ordered to search the 
Warm- Spring Mountain, where, it is lately reported, the 
Indians rendezvous. The commission you have sent 
for holding courts -martial is yet insufficient, as it is 
copied, I suppose, too literally after Governor Innes, who 
had no power to hold a general court-martial, or to try 
commissioned officers. But this may be postponed 
until I come down, which will be in a short time after I 
arrive at Fort Cumberland. I am your Honor's, &,c.

Winchester, 19 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

Since writing my letter of yesterday's date, the en 
closed came to hand, by which you will be informed of 
a very unlucky affair. * 

I immediately consulted Governor Innes, and such 
officers of my regiment as were at this place, on the 
necessary steps to be taken. They unanimously ad- 
vised, that I should remain here with the fifty recruits 
that are in town, for the defence of the place, until the 
militia be raised, that we may thereby be enabled to 
compose a formidable body, and march out against the 
enemy. 

* A skirmish with the Indians at Edwards's Fort, in which Captain John 
Mercer and several of his party were killed. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 143 

This engagement happened within twenty miles of 
Winchester, and the sergeant, who brought the letter, 
assures me there is reason to imagine, that their num- 
bers are greater than the letter informs. He says there 
were many French among them, and that the chief part 
of the whole were mounted on horseback ; so that there 
is a great probability of their having a design upon this 
place. 

I have sent an express to Lord Fairfax, with a copy 
of Stark's letter, and have desired, in the most earnest 
manner, that he will be expeditious in calling the militia ; 
but, alas ! that is an unhappy dependence ; yet the only 
one we have. I am your Honor's, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 22 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

This encloses several letters, and the minutes of a 
council of war, which was held upon the receipt of 
them. Your Honor may see to what unhappy straits 
the distressed inhabitants and myself are reduced. I 
am too little acquainted, Sir, with pathetic language to 
attempt a description of the people's distresses, though 
I have a generous soul, sensible of wrongs, and swelling 
for redress. But what can I do ? I see their situation, 
know their danger, and participate their sufferings, with- 
out having it in my power to give them further relief, 
than uncertain promises. In short, I see inevitable 
destruction in so clear a light, that, unless vigorous 
measures are taken by the Assembly, and speedy as- 
sistance sent from below, the poor inhabitants that are 
now in forts, must unavoidably fall, while the remainder 
are flying before the barbarous foe. In fine, the melan-

choly situation of the people, the little prospect of 
assistance, the gross and scandalous abuses cast upon 
the officers in general, which is reflecting upon me in 
particular, for suffering misconduct of such extraordinary 
kinds, and the distant prospect, if any, of gaining honor 
and reputation in the service, cause me to lament the 
hour, that gave me a commission, and would induce me, 
at any other time than this of imminent danger, to re- 
sign, without one hesitating moment, a command, from 
which I never expect to reap either honor or benefit ; 
but, on the contrary, have almost an absolute certainty 
of incurring displeasure below, while the murder of 
helpless families may be laid to my account here ! 

The supplicating tears of the women, and moving pe- 
titions of the men, melt me into such deadly sorrow, 
that I solemnly declare, if I know my own mind, I could 
offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy, 
provided that would contribute to the people's ease. 

Lord Fairfax has ordered men from the adjacent 
counties, but when they will come, or in what numbers, 
I cannot pretend to determine. If I may judge from 
the success we have met with here, I have but little 
hope, as three days' incessant endeavours have pro- 
duced but twenty men. 

I have too often urged my opinion for vigorous meas- 
ures, and shall only add, that, besides the accounts you 
will receive in the letters, we are told from all parts, that 
the woods appear to be alive with Indians, who feast 
upon the fat of the land. As we have not more than a 
barrel or two of powder at this place, the rest being at 
Fort Cumberland, I could wish that some might be sent 
up. I have written to Alexandria and Fredericksburg, 
desiring that two barrels may be sent from each place, 
but whether there is any at either, I know not. I have 
sent orders to Captain Harrison to be diligent on the

waters where he is posted, and to use his utmost en- 
deavours to protect the people; and, if possible, to 
surprise the enemy at their sleeping-places. Ashby's 
letter is a very extraordinary one. The design of the 
Indians was only, in my opinion, to intimidate him into 
a surrender. For which reason I have written him 
word, that if they do attack him, he must defend that 
place to the last extremity, and when bereft of hope, 
lay a train to blow up the fort, and retire by night to 
Fort Cumberland. 

A small fort, which we have at the mouth of Patter- 
son's Creek, containing an officer and thirty men guarding 
stores, was attacked smartly by the French and Indians ; 
they were as warmly received, upon which they retired. 
Our men at present are dispersed in small bodies, 
guarding the people and public stores. 

I am your Honor's, &c.* 

* The Governor, on receiving this letter, immediately ordered out one 
half of the militia in ten of the upper counties. Colonel Fairfax, one of 
the Council, wrote at the same time to Colonel Washington ; 

" The House of Burgesses are pleased with the Governor's orders, and 
depend on your vigilance and success. Your endeavours in the service 
and defence of your country must redound to your honor ; therefore do 
not let any unavoidable interruptions sicken your mind in the attempts 
you may pursue. Your good health and fortune are the toast at every 
table. Among the Romans, such a general acclamation and public regard, 
shown to any of their chieftains, were always esteemed a high honor, and 
gratefully accepted." 

Landon Carter also wrote as follows. "Virginia has been neglected 
by the mother country. Had there been a more active king on the throne 
of France, she would have made a conquest of it long ago. If we talk of 
obliging men to serve their country, we are sure to hear a fellow mumble 
over the words ' liberty ' and ' property ' a thousand times. I think as you do. 
I have endeavoured, though not in the field, yet in the senate, as much as 
possible to convince the country of danger, and she knows it ; but such is 
her parsimony, that she is willing to wait for the rains to wet the powder, 
and rats to eat the bow-strings of the enemy, rather than attempt to drive 
them from her frontiers."

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 24 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

Not an hour, nay scarcely a minute, passes, that doe 
not produce fresh alarms and melancholy accounts. 
Nor is it possible to give the people the necessary as- 
sistance for their defence, on account of the small num- 
ber of men we have, or that are likely to be here for 
some time. The inhabitants are removing daily, and in 
a short time will leave this country as desolate as 
Hampshire, where scarce a family lives. 

Three families were murdered the night before last, 
at the distance of less than twelve miles from this place ; 
and every day we have accounts of such cruelties and 
barbarities, as are shocking to human nature. It is not 
possible to conceive the situation and danger of this 
miserable country. Such numbers of French and In- 
dians are all around, that no road is safe ; and here we 
know not the hour when we may be attacked. 

As it is not in my power to give you a full account of 
every thing, I have sent Captain Peachey to wait upon 
you, who can be more ample and satisfactory in every 
point, that requires your notice. I have written for the 
militia of Fairfax, Prince William, and Culpeper, and 
expect them here in a very few days. But how they 
are to be supplied with ammunition and provisions, I am 
quite at a loss to know. The distance of Fort Cumber- 
land from us, where these supplies are, renders them 
useless, in a manner, and puts us to the greatest straits ; 
and as the inhabitants are leaving their farms, it will be 
impossible for the militia to subsist without a supply of 
provisions, which are now very scarce, and will be more 
so. I should therefore be glad if your Honor would 
send up arms, ammunition, and provisions, and give im- 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 147 

mediate orders for the Irish beef at Alexandria, which 
cannot be had without your consent. 

You spoke of sending some Indians to our assistance, 
in which no time should be lost, nor any means omitted 
to engage all the Catawbas and Cherokees, that can 
possibly be gathered, and immediately to despatch them 
hither. Unless we have Indians to oppose Indians, we 
may expect but small success. And I should think it 
no bad scheme, while the Indians remain here in such 
numbers, to have a detachment sent out with some 
friendly Indians to make an attempt upon the hostile 
towns, though this should be executed with all imagin- 
able secrecy. 

I hear the Assembly is for augmenting the forces in 
pay to fifteen hundred only, which are far too few to 
defend the frontiers against so numerous an enemy. 
But I have often written you my sentiments upon this 
and other subjects, and shall not now enlarge. I have 
also written to the Speaker by Captain Peachey, who 
will, I imagine, communicate to you what demands your 
immediate regard. 

I wish your Honor would inform me, whether the 
militia expected here must be supplied out of the public 
stock of provisions laid up for the soldiers, or are to 
supply themselves. The want of due direction in mat- 
ters of this nature causes great inconvenience. Give 
me leave to urge your speedy care in sending men and 
ammunition to our assistance, else the consequence may 
prove very fatal in a little time. 

I have been just now told, that numbers about the 
neighbourhood hold councils and cabals for very dis- 
honorable purposes, and unworthy the thoughts of a 
British subject. Despairing of assistance and protection 
from below (as they foolishly conjecture), they talk of 
capitulating and agreeing upon terms with the French 



148 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JE T . 24. 

and Indians, rather than lose their lives and fortunes 
through obstinacy. My force, at present, is very weak, 
and unable to take the necessary measures, as to those 
suspected persons ; but, as soon as the militia arrive, be 
assured I will do my utmost to detect and secure such 
pests of society, if my information is not groundless, 
which I should be pleased to find so. 

I enclose a copy of a council of war lately held here, 
and copies of some letters received since my last to you ; 
one of which, for Colonel Martin, has been just sent to 
me from Fort Hopewell, on the South Branch. They 
have had an engagement there, with the French and 
Indians, the particulars of which you will see by the en- 
closed. Captain Waggener, with a party of his men, 
joined them the next day, and went in pursuit of the 
enemy, but could not come up with them. The waters 
were so high, that although Captain Waggener heard 
them engaged, he could send them no assistance. From 
these and other circumstances, you may form but a 
faint idea of the wretched situation of this country, nor 
can it be adequately conceived. 

My extreme hurry, confusion, and anxiety must plead 
an excuse for incorrectness. I am your Honor's, &,c. 



TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES, VIRGINIA. 

Winchester, 24 April, 1756. 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I received yours by Mr. Kirkpatrick, and 
am sorry to hear of the reflections upon the conduct of 
the officers. I could wish that their names had been 
particularized, that justice might be done to the inno- 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 149 

cent and guilty ; for it is extremely hard, that the whole 
corps should suffer reproaches for the inadvertence and 
misconduct of a few. * 

The deplorable situation of this people is no more to 
be described, than my anxiety and uneasiness for their 
relief. You may expect, by the time this comes to 
hand, that, without a considerable reinforcement, Fred- 
eric county will not be mistress of fifteen families. 
They are now retreating to the securest parts in droves 
of fifties. In short, every thing has too melancholy an 
appearance for pen to communicate. I have therefore 
sent an officer, whose good sense and judicious observa- 
tions will be a more effectual way of transmitting an 
account of the people's distresses. 

I wish the Assembly had given two thousand, instead 
of fifteen hundred men, and that I had been acquainted 
with the dispositions they intended to make. Since I 
am ignorant of these, I hope it will not be thought pre- 
suming in me to offer my sentiments upon the subject. 

We are, Sir, first to consider, that, if a chain of forts 
is to be erected upon our frontiers, it will be done with 
a design to protect the people ; therefore, if these forts 

* His orders for preserving discipline must be allowed to have been 
sufficiently rigid. The following is a specimen. 

" Any commissioned officer, who stands by and sees irregularities com- 
mitted, and does not endeavour to quell them, shall be immediately put 
under arrest. Any non-commissioned officer present, who does not inter- 
pose, shall be immediately reduced, and receive corporal punishment. 

" Any soldier, who shall presume to quarrel or fight, shall receive five 
hundred lashes, without the benefit of a court-martial. The offender, upon 
complaint made, shall have strict justice done him. Any soldier found 
drunk shall receive one hundred lashes, without benefit of a court-martial." 

To the major of his regiment he wrote on another occasion; "Your 
own good sense has sufficiently prompted you to study the nature of your 
duty ; but at the same time permit me, as a duty incumbent on myself, to 
recommend in the strongest terms to you the necessity of qualifying your- 
self by reading for the discharge of the duty of major, a post which requires 
a thorough knowledge of the service, and on the due execution of which 
your own credit, as well as that of the regiment, greatly depends." 

M* 



150 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 24. 

are more than fifteen or eighteen miles, or a day's march, 
asunder, and garrisoned with less than eighty or a hun- 
dred men each, the object is not answered, and for these 
reasons. First, if they are at greater distances, it will 
be inconvenient for the soldiers to scout, and will allow 
the enemy to pass between undiscovered. Secondly if 
they are garrisoned with less than eighty or a hundred 
men, the number will be too few to afford detachments. 
Then, again, our frontiers are so extensive, that, were 
the enemy to attack us on the one side, they might, be- 
fore the troops on the other could reach the spot, over- 
run and destroy half the country. And it is mere than 
probable, if they had a design in one direction, they 
would make a feint in another. We are also to consider 
what sums the building of twenty forts, and the remov- 
ing of stores and provisions to each, would cost. In the 
last place, we are to inquire where and when this ex- 
pense will end. For, unless we endeavour to remove 
the cause, we shall be liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now, if the war continues, and the 
enemy is allowed to remain on the Ohio. 

I shall next give the reasons, which I think make for 
a defensive plan. If the neighbouring colonies refuse 
us their assistance, we have neither strength nor ability 
to conduct an expedition ; and, if we had, and were the 
whole to join us, I do not see to what purpose, since we 
have neither a train of artillery, artillery -men, nor engi- 
neers to execute any scheme beyond the mountains 
against a regular fortress. Again, we have neither 
stores nor provisions, arms nor ammunition, wagons nor 
horses, in any degree proportioned to the service ; and 
to undertake an affair, where we are sure to fall through, 
would be productive of the worst consequences. By 
another defeat we should entirely lose the interest of 
every Indian. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 151 

If, then, we cannot act offensively with a prospect of 
success, we must be upon the defensive ; and that there 
is no way to protect the people, or save ourselves, but 
by a chain of forts, is certain. 

I would beg leave, in that case, to propose that a 
strong fort should be erected at this place, for a general 
receptacle of all the stores, and a place of residence for 
the commanding officers, which may be garrisoned by 
one company for the security of the stores, serving also 
as escorts for wagons, that are going higher up. It is 
the most public and convenient post for intelligence of 
any in the country, and approaches nearest to the parts, 
that will ever be attacked by numbers. 

I have found by experience, that being just within 
the inhabitants is essential, in giving orders for the de- 
fence of the people ; and that Fort Cumberland is of no 
more use towards that defence, than Fort George at 
Hampton. For the people, as soon as they are alarmed, 
immediately fly inwards, and at this time there is not an 
inhabitant living between this place and Fort Cumber- 
land, except a few settlements upon the Manor around 
a fort we built there, and a few families at Edwards's, on 
Cacapehon River, with a guard of ours, which makes 
this very town at present the outermost frontier. Though 
a place trifling in itself, it is yet of the utmost impor- 
tance, as it commands the communication from east to 
west, and from nortfy to south. At this place almost 
all the roads centre. It secures the great roads from 
one half our frontiers to the markets of the neighbouring 
colonies, as well as to those on Rappahannoc and Poto- 
mac. At Fort Cumberland I would have one company 
garrisoned to secure the place, to procure the earliest 
intelligence, and to cover the detachments that may be 
sent towards the Ohio, which is all the use it can ever 
be put to. In the next place, I would propose, that a 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



r.24. 



good fort should be erected between this and Fort 
Cumberland, in a line with the chain of forts across the 
country, and garrisoned by two companies. This I 
would advise, because, as I before observed, if we are 
ever attacked by a large body, it must be here, since 
there is no other road to our frontiers, either for trans- 
porting men or necessaries. 

These three forts will employ four companies, which 
will be a tolerable body, if the companies are large, as 
they would be, according to the plan I sent you. And 
it would be a trifling expense to augment each company 
to one hundred privates, making two thousand, exclu- 
sive of officers, who were included in the scheme last 
sent. 

After this is done, I would post the remaining com- 
panies equidistant, or at proper passes, along our fron- 
tiers, agreeably to the enclosed sketch, and order 
communications to be opened between fort and fort, and 
large detachments to scout and discover the tracks of 
the enemy. 

It needs now only to be inquired, upon what part of our 
frontiers these forts are to be built. The Great Ridge, 
or North Mountain, so called in Evans's map, to which 
I refer, is now become our exterior bound, there not 
being one inhabitant beyond, on all the Potomac waters, 
except a few families on the South Branch, and at 
Joseph Edwards's, on Cacapehon, as already mentioned. 
So that it requires some consideration to determine 
whether we are to build near this place, with a view to 
protect the present inhabitants ; or on the South Branch> 
or at Patterson's Creek, in the hope of drawing back 
those, who have forsaken their dwellings. 

If we do not build there, that country will ever want 
settlers ; and if we do, there is so great a blank, with 
such a series of mountains between, that it will be next

to impossible to guard the people effectually. I could 
again wish, that the Assembly had given two thousand 
men, exclusive of officers, to be formed into two battal- 
ions of ten companies each. Indeed, fifteen hundred 
men are a greater number than ever was in a regiment 
of only one battalion, and they should be divided into 
two, with four field-officers, who should be so posted as 
to have the immediate care of a certain number of forts, 
with orders to draw from one to another, as occasion 
should require. * 

I could add more on this subject, but I am so hurried, 
that I am obliged to refer you for further particulars to 
the bearer, who will tell you, that, to carry on all these 
works, a number of tools, as well as many other neces- 
saries, will be wanting. 

I have given my opinion with candor, and submit to 
correction with the greatest pleasure. Confusion and 
hurry must be an apology for the incoherence and 
incorrectness of this letter. 

I am, dear Sir, yours, &c. 

* Governor Dinwiddie had formed a project of a much more extensive 
chain of forts, embracing the whole line of frontier from Crown Point to 
the country of the Creek Indians. This project he communicated to the 
Board of Trade on the 23d of February. 

A peculiar feature of his. plan was, that the expenses of erecting and 
supporting these forts should be provided for by a land and poll-tax, to be 
levied by an act of Parliament, which should take effect equally through- 
out all the colonies. He proposed a poll-tax of one shilling sterling for two 
years, which he thought would be sufficient for building the forts ; and a 
perpetual land-tax of two shillings on every hundred acres of land, as a 
fund for keeping up the garrisons. " I know," he adds, " that our poople 
will be inflamed, if they hear of my making this proposal, as they are 
averse to all taxes ; but in my duty, and in obedience to your commands, I 
cannot but think it the most eligible, and it will remain as long as the 
land ; but, if not done by an act of the British Parliament, I may venture 
to affirm, that no governors on this continent will be able to prevail on the 
Assemblies to pass laws for this purpose." 

By his calculation there were at least a million of taxable polls in the 
colonies. Hence this tax would produce fifty thousand pounds a year.

154 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 24. 

TO GOVERNOR DIJVWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 27 April, 1756. 

SIR, 

I sent an express to Fort Cumberland on Tuesday 
last, who is just returned with the enclosed letters, 
which I forward, to prevent the trouble of extracting a 
part. 

In my letter to Colonel Stephen, I informed him, 
among other things, of the accusations laid to his charge, 
and that he must expect to have, the matter inquired 
into. You will see what he says upon the subject. 

Desolation and murder still increase, and no prospects 
of relief. The Blue Ridge is now our frontier, no men 
being left in this county, except a few that keep close 
with a number of women and children in forts, which 
they have erected for that purpose. There are now no 
militia in this county. When there were, they could 
not be brought to action. If the inhabitants of the ad- 
jacent counties pursue the same system of disobedience, 
the whole must fall an inevitable sacrifice ; and there is 
room to fear, that they have caught the infection, as I 
have sent, besides divers letters to Lord Fairfax, ex- 
press after express to hurry them on, and yet I have no 
tidings of their march. We have the greatest reason to 
believe, that the number of the enemy is very consider- 
able, as they are spread all over this part of the country ; 
and that their success, and the spoils with which they 

And the land-tax, estimated by the quitrents paid in Virginia, he believed 
would yield annually sixty thousand pounds. 

The population of Virginia he considered at this time to be 293,472, of 
whom 173,316 were white, and 120,156 black. The militia were com- 
puted at 35,000 men fit to bear arms. The Governor wrote to Mr. Fox, 
one of the Secretaries of State ; " We dare not venture to part with any 
of our white men any distance, as we must have a watchful eye over our 
negro slaves, who are upwards of one hundred thousand." Letter Books

have enriched themselves, dished up with a good deal 
of French policy, will encourage the Indians of distant 
nations to fall upon our inhabitants in greater numbers, 
and, if possible, with greater rapidity. They enjoy the 
sweets of a profitable war, and will no doubt improve 
the success, which must ever attend their arms, unless 
we have Indians to oppose theirs. I would therefore 
advise, as I often have done, that there should be neither 
trouble nor expense omitted to bring the few, who are 
still inclined, into our service, and that, too, with the 
greatest care and expedition. A small number, just to 
point out the wiles and tracks of the enemy, is better 
than none ; for which reason I must earnestly recom- 
mend, that those, who accompanied Major Lewis, 
should be immediately sent up, and such of the Cataw- 
bas as can be engaged in our interest. If such another 
torrent as this has been, (or may be ere it is done,) 
should press upon our settlements, there will not be a 
living creature left in Frederic county ; and how soon 
Fairfax and Prince William may share its fate is easily 
conceived, if we only consider a cruel and bloodthirsty 
enemy, conquerors already possessed of the finest part 
of Virginia, plenteously filled with all kinds of pro- 
visions, pursuing a people overcome with fear and con- 
sternation at the inhuman murders of these barbarous 
savages. 

The inhabitants, who are now in forts, are greatly dis- 
tressed for the want of ammunition and provision, and 
are incessantly importuning me for both; neither of 
which have I at this place to spare. And if I had, I 
should be much embarrassed to know how to act, as I 
could not be safe in delivering them without your or- 
ders ; but to hear the cries of the hungry, who have fled 
for refuge to these places, with nothing more than they 
carried on their backs, is exceedingly moving. I hope, 



156 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



[JSx. 24. 



therefore, that you will give directions concerning this 
matter. 

I have written to the Assembly, setting forth the 
great necessity of erecting a large and strong fort at this 
place, to serve as a receptacle for all our stores, and a 
place of refuge for the women and children in times of 
danger. Were this work completed, the men would 
upon any alarm, as they say themselves, immediately 
lodge their families here, and turn out against the enemy. 
But without some such place of defence, they must 
always fly in the manner they have done, in order to 
secure their wives and children. 

This is the place generally fixed upon, as it has a free 
and open communication with all the country, from its 
peculiar situation. It also secures the communication 
with the neighbouring colonies, and is conveniently situ- 
ated for procuring intelligence. This is now fully proved 
by the experience I have had since I came here. From 
the time the first murders were committed by the In- 
dians, I have never missed of receiving intelligence of 
their motions, while Colonel Stephen has, in a manner, 
lived in total ignorance. The reason is obvious. Fort 
Cumberland is detached so far beyond the inhabitants, 
that no person thinks of alarming it, but immediately, 
upon the first fright, they retire within the settlements. 

You will observe some parts of Colonel Stephen's let- 
ters, about reinforcements from the second division, and 
the number of men, which were only meant as a finesse, 
in case they should fall into the enemy's hands. The 
letters, conveying the true accounts, were put into the 
pummel of the saddle, as were mine to him. 

I have been formerly, and am at present, pretty full 
in offering my opinion and counsel upon matters, which 
regard the public safety and interest. These have been 
solely the object of all my thoughts, words, and actions ; 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 157 

and, in order to avoid censure in every part of my con- 
duct, I make it a rule to obey the dictates of your Honor, 
the Assembly, and a good conscience. 

I shall not hereafter trouble you further on these to- 
pics, as I can add nothing to what I have said. 

I am your Honor's, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 3 May, 1756. 

SIR, 

I have sent down an Indian scalp, which was taken 
at the place where Captain Mercer had his engagement. 
He was found thrust under some rocks, with stones 
piled up against them. They believe more were killed, 
from the quantity of blood found on the ground, and 
from other discoveries of their attempts to make more 
graves. But a hard shower of rain prevented their mak- 
ing a farther search. 

We have reason to believe, that the Indians have re- 
turned to Fort Duquesne, as some scouts from Fort 
Cumberland saw their tracks that way ; and many cor- 
roborating accounts affirm, that the roads over the 
Allegany Mountains are as much beaten, as they were 
last year by General Braddock's army. From these 
and other circumstances we may judge their numbers to 
have been considerable. Whether they are gone for the 
season, or only to bring in a larger party, I am at a loss 
to determine. 

For this reason, and on account of the scarcity of 
provisions on this side of Fort Cumberland, I must beg 
leave humbly to offer it to your Honor's superior judg- 
ment, if it would not be advisable to stop all the militia, 
that are ordered from the ten counties, save about five 

VOL. II. N 



158 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 

or six hundred from the adjacent ones. These will 
serve to cover our frontiers in this quarter, (which is the 
only part that ever will or can be much exposed,) until 
the regiment is completed by drafts, and until they can 
erect fortresses. Drafts, if they are judiciously chosen, 
will be of infinitely more service, and much less expen- 
sive to the country, and they can be immediately sent 
to their posts. 

I am convinced, that, if your Honor has a mind to 
stop any part of the militia, you will have full time, not- 
withstanding they are ordered to rendezvous at this 
place on the 10th instant. I never yet knew any to ap- 
pear within ten days of the time they were expected ; 
and I am also apprehensive, that having so many of the 
militia out will be the means of retarding the drafts, 
which, above all things, I wish to see completed. 

Though I have often troubled you on this head, I 
must again beg leave to desire your particular instruc- 
tions and information, as, being in a state of uncertainty, 
without knowing the plan of operations, or what scheme 
to go upon, I am much embarrassed, and left to guess at 
every thing. Orders, that are essential one day, appear 
the next as necessary to be countermanded ; so that I 
really cannot tell how to act for the good of the service, 
or the satisfaction of any individual. Were the regi- 
ment complete, and things put on a proper footing, the 
whole would go on smoothly and regularly, which is 
now rendered impossible. So much am I kept in the 
dark, that I do not know whether to prepare for the of- 
fensive or defensive ; yet, what might be absolutely 
necessary in the one, would be quite useless in the 
other. 

Great inconveniences arise from our being so dis- 
persed through the country. The men cannot be regu- 
larly paid or supplied. If every company had its

post assigned, their pay might be sent to them, and 
necessaries always provided in due season. We could 
also have the same advantages were we collected into 
one place. But there are now so many detachments 
out, that one officer may command men of every com- 
pany of the regiment, and when necessaries are sent, he 
may be removed from his command, and those things 
cannot be stopped out of their pay. By this method 
the country loses money, the men are badly supplied, 
and always discontented. 

I find the act of Assembly against mutiny and deser- 
tion quite insufficient, except in those two particular 
crimes. No court-martial can be held, by virtue of this 
act, for trying any officer or soldier charged with cow- 
ardice, holding correspondence with the enemy, quitting 
or sleeping upon his post, nay, many other crimes, 
which are provided against in the articles of war. I 
think, at this time, it would be for the good of the ser- 
vice to make an act to enforce the articles of war in 
general, except two or three particular ones, such as im- 
pressing wagons, and the like. They are in force in our 
mother country, where they are thought best calculated 
for keeping soldiers under discipline ; and none of them 
would prove burthensome, or inconvenient, either to the 
public or any individual. 

About one hundred and fifty of the Fairfax militia are 
now in town. Three hundred are expected from* Prince 
William. With the soldiers and militia now here, I in- 
tend to go out and scour the woods hereabouts for three 
or four days until the others arrive. 

Clothes for the men are very much wanted. We 
have none in store, and some men, who have been en- 
listed these two months, and to whom we could give 
nothing but a blanket, shoes, and shirt, are justly dissat- 
isfied at having two pence per day stopped from their

wages.* Provision here is scarce, and the commissary 
much wanted to lay in more. I have been, and still am, 
obliged to do this duty, as well as most others, which I 
would take upon me, rather than let any thing in my 
power be wanted for the good of the country. 

I enclose your Honor the sentence of a general court- 
martial, which was held here upon a sergeant for running 
away with his party. They have, I think, very justly 
adjudged him to suffer death, which sentence I hope 
you will approve, as there never was a fitter object to 
make an example of, this being the second time he has 
been guilty of the same crime. I am your Honor's, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 23 May, 1756. 

SIR, 

The method I shall use to inform you of the proceed- 
ings of the militia, is to enclose a transcript of my journal 
relating to that affair, and to send a copy of a council 
of war held here by the field-officers of those coun- 
ties, whose militia you were pleased to order to our 
assistance, f 

* The soldiers were paid eight pence a day. Out of this amount two 
pence a day were reserved for supplying them with clothes. 

f The militia, who had assembled at Winchester upon the recent alarm, 
had given the commander infinite trouble and anxiety. On this subject 
Colonel William Fairfax wrote to him ; 

" I am sensible, that such a medley of undisciplined militia must create 
you various troubles, but, having Caesar's Commentaries, and perhaps 
Quintus Curtius, you have therein read of greater fatigues, murmurings, 
mutinies, and defections, than will probably come to your share ; though, 
if any of those casualties should interrupt your quiet, I doubt not you 
would bear them with a magnanimity equal to that of any of the heroes of 
those times. 

" The Council and Burgesses are mostly your friends ; so that if you

I have found it impossible to go to Fort Cumberland, 
without letting matters of greater importance here suffer 
in my absence ; such a multiplicity of different kinds of 
business am I at present engaged in. Governor Innes 
is gone up, who, I hope, will assist with his advice in 
setting things in order, if any irregularities have been 
practised contrary to the rules of the army. 

I have ordered a sufficient number of officers to be 
left at Fort Cumberland, and the rest to repair to this 
place, that they may proceed to Fredericksburg, agree- 
ably to your Honor's commands. As soon as the gen- 
tlemen Associators arrive here, I shall take that place in 
my way to William sburg, to settle my accounts, and re- 
ceive more money, which is already scarce with me. I 
am heartily glad, that you have fixed upon those gentle- 
men to point out the places for erecting forts, but regret 
to find their motions so slow. * The summer will be so 

have not always particular instructions from the Governor, which you 
think necessary and desire, the omission, or neglect, may proceed from the 
confidence entertained in your ability and discretion to do what is fit and 
praiseworthy." 

* These gentlemen Associators were a company of mounted volunteers, 
at the head of whom was Peyton Randolph, the attorney-general. They 
marched towards Winchester, but the alarm subsided before they had an 
opportunity of putting their martial spirit to the test. 

Mr. Robinson, the speaker, after giving notice to Colonel Washington 
of the organization of this company of gentlemen volunteers, added ; - - 
" The Council and House of Burgesses have agreed on a representation 
to his Majesty, in which you and the other officers are recommended to 
his Majesty's favor. Our hopes, dear George, are all fixed on you for 
bringing our affairs to a happy issue." 

It was probably in accordance with the above sentiment of the Council 
and Assembly, that the Governor wrote as follows to Major-General Aber- 
cromby, May 28th. 

" As we are told the Earl of Loudoun is to raise three regiments [one 
regiment of four battalions] on this continent, on the British establishment, 
I do not venture to trouble him immediately on his arrival with any recom- 
mendations ; but, good Sir, give me leave to pray your interest with his 
Lordship in favor of Colonel George Washington, who, I will venture to 
say, is a very deserving gentleman, and has from the beginnincr com-

far advanced, that, if we meet with opposition in con- 
ducting the work, the difficulties and delays attending 
the execution cannot be described. 

It gave me infinite concern to be informed, that the 
Assembly had levied their troops until December only. 
By the time they will have entered into the service, 
they will claim a discharge. They cannot get the least 
smattering of their duty, and we find by experience, that 
our poor and ragged soldiers would kill the most active 
militia in five days' marching, so little are the latter ac- 
quainted with fatigue. Men would almost as soon have 
entered the service for seventeen months, as for seven, 
and in that time I am convinced we could have enlisted 
them upon our own terms. As it is, some perhaps may 
be obtained. 

In a recent letter your Honor approved the scheme I 
sent down for forming the regiment into two battalions 
of twenty companies, assigning one to each of the field- 
officers, but never gave any directions concerning the 
appointments. Nor do I think there can be any plan 
judiciously concerted, until we know what number of 
forts is to be built upon our frontiers, as the number of 
our companies must in a great measure depend upon the 
divisions of the regiment. There are now several vacan- 
cies in the regiment, and I have but one blank commis- 
sion. Indeed, if I had more, I should not think it prudent 
to fill them up, until matters are a little better regulated. 

At this place I have begun the fort according to your 

manded the forces of this dominion. General Braddock had so high an 
esteem for his merit, that he made him one of his aids-de-camp, and, if he 
had survived, I believe he would have provided handsomely for him in the 
regulars. He is a person much beloved here, and he has gone through 
many hardships in the service, and I really think he has great merit, and 
believe he can raise more men here, than any one present that I know. 
If his Lordship will be so good as to promote him in the British establish- 
ment, I think he will answer my recommendation." Dinwiddie's Letter 
Books.

orders, and have found that the work could not be con- 
ducted, if I were away, which was one among many 
reasons, that detained me here.* I have also ordered 
Captain Stewart, who commands at Conococheague, to 
fortify that place as well as he can, with such tools as he 
can procure. 

Mr. Dick, who is just returned from the northward, 
says, orders have been given for drawing out all the 
ammunition and other stores belonging to the train at 
Fort Cumberland, and to send them immediately round 
to New York. I have thought it expedient to give your 
Honor the earliest advice ; for should this be done, it will 
leave that place entirely defenceless, and stop the source 
of our supplies. I have given Colonel Stephen previous 
notice of it, and have desired that he will induce the 
conductor of the train, in whose care it is left, to have 
Ashby's, Cox's, and the other forts plentifully furnished, 
before such an order arrives. I am, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 25 June, 1756. 

SIR, 

I doubt not but your Honor will be as much surprised, 
as I have been concerned and vexed, at my stay here. 

When I left Williamsburg, I did it with a design to 
proceed with the utmost expedition to Fort Cumber- 
land. I arrived at Fredericksburg to dinner, the day 
after I left your Honor, at one o'clock, and gave the 
officer, posted at that place, a List of such tools as were 
wanted to build the chain of forts, and ordered them to 
be sent by a wagon, pressed for that purpose, immedi- 

* This fort, built at Winchester, was called Fort Loudoun. 



164 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Ex. 24. 

ately to Winchester, to which place I repaired to get 
every thing in readiness, and wait their coming to escort 
them to Fort Cumberland. I thought it needless to 
proceed without them, as nothing can be done for want 
of tools. I have sent two or three expresses to hurry 
them on, and shall make no delay when they arrive. 
I intend to take the advice of a council of war, when I 
arrive at Fort Cumberland, as to the line on which these 
forts are to be erected, and shall visit all the grounds 
that I conveniently can, and direct the building. 

It is a work, that must be conducted tediously for 
these reasons, namely, the scarcity of tools, the small- 
ness of our numbers, and the want of conductors. 

The strength of our forces will not admit of many 
divisions, because, in that case, each party may probably 
be diminished. We can, therefore, only attempt, with 
such men as can be drawn out of the garrisons already 
established, to build fort after fort, and not, by attempting 
too many at a time, thereby run the risk of having the 
whole demolished. To go on in the manner above 
mentioned must be extremely tedious, unless you will 
be pleased to put the militia upon our southern frontiers 
under the command of Captain Hogg, and order them 
to begin on the Mayo River, and proceed in their build- 
ing until they meet our parties, who will advance south- 
ward. I can point out no other method at present to 
expedite this necessary work. 

If you approve this scheme, and will let me know it 
by an express, I shall despatch another with the inform- 
ation to Captain Hogg, and enclose to him such a plan, 
as the whole will be directed by. Your orders to the 
militia, and indeed to the inhabitants of these parts, to 
assist with their advice in fixing upon the places, and 
with their labor in forwarding the work, are absolutely 
necessary. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 165 

Your Honor never gave me a decisive answer to a 
question I asked, about assigning companies to the field- 
officers. For this reason I have presumed to repeat it 
again, because there are two companies now vacant, by 
the death of .Captain John Mercer, and the resignation 
of Captain Savage, and they should either be given to 
field-officers, or to the oldest lieutenants. No advan- 
tage can possibly arise to the field-officers from having 
companies, since they are allowed, I suppose, the same 
pay now, as they would receive in such a case. 

Two hundred and forty -six drafts are the total 
number brought in. Of these several have deserted. 
Three were discharged, being quite unfit for service, 
(and indeed several more ought to be discharged, if men 
were not so scarce,) and there remain now in confine- 
ment six Quakers, who will neither bear arms, work, 
receive provisions or pay, nor do any thing that tends, in 
any respect, to self-defence. I should be glad of your 
directions how to proceed with them. I cannot yet re- 
turn to you the names of the volunteers, that will be ap- 
pointed to the vacancies, but as soon as I arrive at Fort 
Cumberland I shall acquaint you according to request. 

Governor Sharpe is building a fort on Potomac River, 
about fifteen miles above Conococheague, which may be 
of great service towards the protection of our people on 
that side. It is thought the fort will cost the province 
of Maryland near thirty thousand pounds, before it is 
finished. I am, &,c.* 

* The Governor and Assembly of Maryland had come at last to a tem- 
porary reconciliation of their differences, so far as to agree in a bill for 
raising forty thousand pounds for his Majesty's service. Of this sum 
eleven thousand pounds were to be appropriated to building a fort on the 
frontiers, near but not beyond the North Mountain ; and twenty-five thou- 
sand for carrying on any expedition for the public service, in which the 
other colonies might join. By the same act the Governor was authorized 
to raise two hundred men, to be employed in constructing the fort. Ads

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDPIE. 



SIR, 



Winchester, 4 August, 1756. 






Giving the necessary orders and directions, about the 
chain of forts to be built on the frontiers, has kept me 
so closely employed, that I could not write fully to yoi 
until this time. But I have got that trouble now pretty 
well off my hands, as I have despatched orders, plans, 
and tools to all the officers appointed to that duty. 

By the enclosed proceedings of a council held at Fort 
Cumberland, you will see our determination, and where 
it is necessary to erect the forts. Although we have not 
kept strictly to the act of Assembly, I hope it will be 
overlooked, as I am sensible that this will be the best 
chain that can possibly be erected ior the defence of the 
people, and that the Assembly aimed at that, but, being 
unacquainted with the situation of the country, had 
fallen into an error.* 



of Assembly passed in May, 1756. M c Mahon's History of Maryland, 
Vol. I. p. 305. The fort was called FORT FREDERIC. It was a work of 
considerable magnitude, situated on an eminence about five hundred yards 
from the Potomac River, of a quadrangular form, and constructed of dura- 
ble materials. Parts of it still remain, in a state of good preservation, sur- 
rounded by cultivated fields, and the triumphs of industry, which three 
quarters of a century have effected in one of the most beautiful and fertile 
regions of the western world. 

* Soon after writing the letter of June 25th, Colonel Washington went 
to Fort Cumberland, where he remained several days, making arrange- 
ments and giving orders for constructing the chain of forts, which was to 
extend southward along the South Branch of the Potomac, till it reached 
the head waters of Jackson's River, and thence down that river. The 
gentlemen Associators were to have had some voice in this matter, as inti- 
mated heretofore, but their military ardor seems to have subsided, and 
their resolution to have abated, before they reached Colonel Washington's 
camp. The direction of the chain, and the position of the principal forts, 
were determined by a council of officers at Fort Cumberland. The act of 
Assembly specified certain localities, which the Council decided to be in-

I make no doubt, that you have ere this heard of the 
defeat of Lieutenant Rutherford of the Rangers, escort- 
ing an express to me at Fort Cumberland, and of the 
dastardly behaviour of the militia, who ran off without 
one half of them having discharged their pieces, al- 
though they were apprised of the ambuscade by one of 
the flanking parties, before the Indians fired upon them ; 
and ran back to Ashby's Fort, contrary to orders, per- 
suasions, and threats. They are all ordered in, as soon 
as the people have secured their harvest. Those of 
King George and Caroline counties are already here. 
The rest I expect shortly. Through the passive be- 
haviour of their officers they are very refractory. 

expedient or impracticable. Herring's Laws of Virginia, Vol. VII. p. 18. 
The chain was built according to the decisions of the Council. . 

The following extract from the Orderly Book, issued in general orders 
by the Commander two days after he reached Fort Cumberland, will show 
that he enforced rigid rules of discipline. 

" Colonel Washington has observed, that the men of his regiment aro 
very profane and reprobate. He takes this opportunity to inform them of 
his great displeasure at such practices, and assures them, that, if they do 
not leave them off, they shall be severely punished. The officers are de- 
sired, if they hear any man swear, or make use of an oath or execration, 
to order the offender twenty-five lashes immediately, without a court- 
martial. For the second offence, he will be more severely punished." 

To a captain he also wrote, about the same time ; " Your suffering 
such clamors among the men argues very great remissness in you. I im- 
agined your being put there over them was partly with an intent to keep 
them quiet and passive, but this express, sent purely to humor them, would 
indicate that you are afraid to do your duty. Let me tell you, in your own 
words, that ' I was very much surprised ' at the contents of your letter, 
written in such a commanding style. And your demands were so express 
and peremptory, that the direction was the only thing, which gave me the 
least room to suspect it could be written to any but John Roe, or some 
other of your menial servants. 

" I am sorry to find your conduct so disagreeable to all the officers, as 
to occasion two, who were appointed to your company, to resign. I must 
therefore desire you will act circumspectly, as I assure you, if I have any 
just complaints made against you, you may expect to answer them." 

This captain was much older in years, than the Commander-in-chief, and 
had probably taken some liberties on that ground. 

Again, to another captain he wrote ; " You are to acquaint Mr. L. that

There is an act of Parliament to allow all servants to 
enlist, and the owners to be paid a reasonable allowance 
for them. If we had this privilege, we could soon com- 
plete the regiment; and I doubt not but his Majesty 
would order them to be paid for, if we enlisted them, as 
soon as for the regulars ; nay, should he not, the ten 
pounds' fine through the country would go a consider- 
able way towards it. And this we may depend upoi 
if we have not this liberty granted us, the servants wil 
all run off to the regular officers, who are recruiting 
around us ; and that would be to weaken our colony 
much, when it could receive no immediate benefit from 
it. For my part, I see no other expedient. * 

he is to remain at his fort, and act as lieutenant of the Rangers, until fur- 
ther orders. Tell him, also, not to stir from his post at his peril, until he 
has leave ; if he does, I will arrest him for his disobedience of orders, and 
try him as soon as he arrives here.'' 

* The servants mentioned in this paragraph were emigrants from Eu- 
rope, or persons imported, whose services were purchased for a term of 
years, either from the masters of vessels, who brought them over, or from 
the individuals themselves. By a law of Virginia, all servants, except con- 
victs, imported without indenture, if they were Christians or of Christian 
parentage, and above nineteen years of age, could be required to serve 
only five years ; if under nineteen, their term of service was limited to the 
age of twenty-four. No such person could ever be sold as a slave. 
Hening, Vol. VI. p. 356. These servants were exempt from military duty. 

When Lord Loudoun succeeded Governor Shirley, as commander of the 
forces in America, he was empowered to raise a regiment in the colonies, 
consisting of four battalions, to be commanded by officers bearing the 
King's commission, and called the Royal Jlmerican Regiment. He was 
authorized, also, to enlist servants of the above description, paying to their 
masters a proper compensation for the time they had yet to serve. Re- 
cruiting officers were now employed in Virginia, enlisting men for the 
Royal Regiment, and interfered essentially with the enlistments for the 
service of the colony. The Governor endeavoured to prevail on the As- 
sembly to draft militia for this regiment, but without success. They voted 
eight thousand pounds to be paid for enlisting men, and transporting them 
to New York. Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. 

The Maryland Assembly appropriated five thousand pounds to aid en- 
listments in that colony for the Royal Regiment, and resolved to raise three 
hundred men. A bounty was given not exceeding five pounds for each 
man enlisted. A letter was received by the Governor from Henry Fox 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 169 

You perceive plainly what effect the act of Assembly, 
in regard to the drafts, has had, and how little our 
strength has been augmented by that scheme, and in 
three or four months we shall not be the better for 
them. They are then to be discharged. 

I could wish we were clear of Fort Cumberland. It 
takes a great part of our small force to garrison it, and I 
see no service that it renders to our colony ; for since 
the Indians have driven the inhabitants so low down, 
they do not hesitate to follow them as far as Conoco- 
cheague and this place. There have been several 
families murdered within two miles of the mouth of 
Conococheague, on the Maryland side, this week ; and 
Fort Cumberland is now so much out of the way, that 
the forces there seldom hear of those things within a 
month after they are done. 

Our men want many necessaries, until the arrival of 
their regimentals, which cannot be had without sending 
to Philadelphia ; and the great loss, which we shall suf- 
fer by sending our paper money for them, has prevented 
my purchasing them, until the men are almost naked. 

I could by no means bring the Quakers to any terms. 
They chose rather to be whipped to death than to bear 
arms, or lend us any assistance whatever upon the fort, 
or any thing for self-defence. Some of their friends 

one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, directing that the com- 
pensation to masters for enlisted servants should be paid by the colony ; 
but the Assembly refused to comply with this order by a majority of more 
than two to one. See Totes and Proceedings for September, 1756. 

The " ten pounds'* fine" spoken of in the text, was the penalty imposed 
on such of the drafted militia as refused to march. This fine was so low, 
that many of the drafts preferred to pay it, and stay at home. 

Governor Dinwiddie said in reply; "If you can enlist servants agree- 
ably to the act of Parliament, the masters of such servants shall be paid 
for the time they have to serve in proportion to the first purchase, but 1 
think you should be careful not to enlist any convicts, who probably may 
be factious and bad examples to the others."

shall be called for ; and I have released them from the 
guard-house until I receive further orders from you, 
which they have agreed to apply for. 

I have supplied the Nottoway Indians with som< 
necessaries, and allowed them to take their arms wit! 
them ; but they 'have received no pay, and they sa] 
they were promised a bit* per day. Captain Toi

a great assistance to us, if they could be engaged to 
come. 

I observe your proposal to Lord Loudoun of carrying 
on an expedition against the Ohio. I have always 
thought it the best and only method to put a stop to the 
incursions of the enemy, as they would then be obliged 
to stay at home to defend their ow r n possessions. But 
we are quite unprepared for such an undertaking. If it 
is fixed upon, now is the time for buying up provisions, 
and laying them in at the most convenient places. The 
Pennsylvania butchers are buying quantities of beef here, 
which should be put a stop to, if we are to march to- 
wards the Ohio. If we are still to remain on the de- 
fensive, and garrison the chain of forts, provisions must 
be laid in at each of them ; and I much fear, if we march 
from the frontiers, all the inhabitants will quit their plan- 
tations. Your sentiments and orders on this head will 
be very agreeable to me, and shall be punctually com- 
plied with. I am, &,c.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER AND TREASURER. 

Winchester, 5 August, 1756. 

SIR, 

Fort Cumberland at present contains all our provis- 
ions and valuable stores, and is not capable of an hour's 
defence, if the enemy were only to bring a single half- 
pounder against it; which they might do with great 
ease on horseback. Besides, it lies so remote from this 
place, as well as from the neighbouring inhabitants, that 
it requires as much force to keep the communication 
open to it, as a fort at the Meadows would do, and em- 
ploys one hundred and fifty men, who are a dead charge 
to the country, as they can be of no other use than just 
to protect and guard the stores, which might as well be 
lodged at Cox's Fort ; * indeed better, for they would 
then be more contiguous to this place, to the inhabitants, 
and to the enemy, and more serviceable, if we should 
ever carry an expedition over the mountains, by opening 
a road where the Indians have blazed, t A strong gar- 
rison there would not only protect the stores, but also 
the few remaining inhabitants on the Branch, t and at the 
same time waylay and annoy the enemy, as they pass 
and repass the mountains. Whereas, the forces at Fort 
Cumberland, lying in a corner quite remote from the in- 
habited parts, to which the Indians always repair to 
commit their murders, can have no intelligence of any 
thing that is doing, but remain in total ignorance of all 
transactions. When I was down, I applied to the Gov-

affair. The following is an exact copy of his answer. 
" Fort Cumberland is a King's fort, and built chiefly at 
the charge of the colony, therefore properly under our 
direction, until a governor is appointed." Now whether 
I am to understand this ay or no, to the plain, simpl< 
question asked, " Is the fort to be continued or re- 
moved 1" I know not. But in all important matters 
I am directed in this ambiguous and uncertain way.* 

Great and inconceivable difficulties arise in the exe- 
cution of my commands, as well as infinite loss and dis- 
repute to the service, by my not having power to pay 
for deserters. I would, therefore, humbly recommend it 
to the consideration of the Committee, whether it would 
not be more for the interest of the country, were I al- 
lowed to pay these demands, rather than have them 
levied in the public claims. Many of our deserters are 
apprehended in Maryland, and some in Pennsylvania, 
and, for the sake of the reward, are brought hither. But 
since they, who apprehend them, are to receive certifi- 
cates only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds 
of tobacco, and those certificates are to be presented to 
a court of claims, there to lie perhaps till they are quite 
forgotten, so much dissatisfaction is created, that many, 
I believe, rather than apprehend one, would aid fifty 
to escape, and this, too, among our own people. 

Another thing, which I should be glad to know, is, 
whether the act of Assembly prohibits the whole forces, 
or only the drafts, from marching out of Virginia, and 
whether it is contrary to law, even to take the drafts out, 
provided it is done with their own consent. If we can- 

* On this head Mr. Speaker Robinson replied ; " The Committee were 
all in opinion with you, that the keeping of Fort Cumberland was an un- 
necessary expense ; but upon my mentioning their opinion to the Governor, 
he appeared very warm, and said Lord Loudoun might do what he pleased, 
but for his part he would not remove the garrison, nor order the fort to be 
demolished."

not take any of the forces out of the colony, the disad- 
vantages, which the country may labor under, are not to 
be described ; for the enemy, in that case, may commit 
the most unheard-of cruelties, and, by stepping across 
the Potomac, evade pursuit, and mock our best en- 
deavours to scourge them. 

The inconveniences that arise from paying the sol- 
diers in large bills, are not to be conceived. We are 
obliged to give the pay of two or three soldiers to one 
man. He, ten to one, drinks, games, or pays it away ; 
by which means the parties are all dissatisfied, and per- 
petually complaining for want of their pay. It also 
prevents them from laying out their pay for absolute 
necessaries, and obliges them many times to drink it 
out ; for they put it into the tavern-keeper's hands, who 
will give no change, unless they will consent to receive 
the greatest part in liquor. In short, for five shillings 
cash you may at any time purchase^ a month's pay from 
the soldiers ; in such contempt do they hold the cur- 
rency. Besides small bills, if the thing is practicable, I 
should be extremely glad to receive some part of the 
money in Spanish and Portugal gold and silver. Many 
things are wanted for the use of the regiment, which 
cannot be had here, and may be obtained at Philadel- 
phia; but the depreciation of our money, out of the 
colony, has prevented my sending thither. 

At the repeated instances of the soldiers, I must pay 
so much regard to their representations, as to transmit 
their complaints. They think it extremely hard, as it is 
indeed, Sir, that they, who perhaps do more duty, and 
undergo more fatigue and hardship, from the nature of 
the service and situation of the country, than any other 
troops on the continent, should be allowed the least pay, 
and smallest encouragements in other respects. The 
Carolinians receive British pay ; the Marylanders, I be-

lieve, the same ; Pennsylvania is exorbitant in rewarding 
her soldiers ; as to the Jerseys and New York, I am not 
informed ; but the New England governments give more 
than a shilling per day, our money, besides an allow- 
ance of rum, pease, tobacco, vinegar, ginger, and the lik( 

Our soldiers complain, that their pay is insufficient, 
even to furnish shoes, shirts, and stockings, which theii 
officers, in order to keep them fit for duty, oblige them 
to provide. This, they say, deprives them of the means 
of purchasing any of the conveniences or necessaries of 
life, and compels them to drag through a disagreeable 
service, in the most disagreeable manner. That their 
pay will not afford more than enough to keep them in 
clothes, I should be convinced for these reasons, if ex- 
perience had not taught me. The British soldiers are 
allowed eight pence sterling per day, with many neces- 
saries that ours are not, and can buy what is requisite 
upon the cheapest terms ; and they lie one half the year 
in camp, or garrison, when they cannot consume the 
fifth part of what ours do in continual marches over 
mountains, rocks, and rivers. Then, Sir, is it possible 
that our men, who receive a fourth less, have two pence 
per day stopped for their regimental clothing, and all 
other stoppages made that British soldiers have, and are 
obliged, by being in continual action, to lay in triple the 
quantity of ammunition and clothes, and at double the 
price, should be able to clear themselves ? It is not to 
be done, and this is the reason why the men have 
always been so bare of clothes. 

And I dare say you will be candid enough to allow, 
that few men would choose to have their lives exposed 
to the incessant insults of a merciless enemy, without 
some view or hope of a reward. Another thing gives 
them great uneasiness, and that is, seeing no regular 
provision made for the maimed and wounded. They

acknowledge the generosity of the Assembly, and have 
the highest veneration for that respectable House ; they 
look with gratitude on the care, which has been taken 
of their brother soldiers ; but they say, this is only an 
act of will, and another Assembly may be much less 
liberal. They have no certainty, that this generosity 
will continue, and consequently can have nothing in 
view but the most gloomy prospects, and no encourage- 
ment to be bold and active ; for as soon as they become 
unfit for service by their wounds, they may be dis- 
charged, and turned upon an uncharitable world to beg, 
steal, or starve. In short, they have a true sense of all 
that can happen, and do not think slightly of the fatigues 
they encounter, in scouring these mountains with their 
provisions on their backs, lying out and watching for the 
enemy, with no other covering to shelter them from the 
inclemency of the weather, than the trees and rocks. 
The old soldiers are affected, and complain of their 
hardships and little encouragement in piteous terms ; 
and they give these as reasons for so much desertion. 
The money expended in paying for deserters, ex- 
presses, horse-hire, losses and abuse of horses, would 
go a great length towards advancing their pay, which I 
hope would contribute not a little to remove the cause 
of this expense. 

I would not have it understood, however, that I mean 
to recommend any thing extraordinary ; no, I would 
give them British pay, and allow them the same privi- 
leges during their stay in the service, and this as a 
reward or compliment for their toil, rather than a matter 
of right. Were the country to give them one suit of 
regimental clothes a year, without receiving the two 
pence stoppage, it would be a full allowance, and cause 
great content and satisfaction. All they want is to be 
entitled to the privileges and immunities of soldiers, of 



176 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mi. 24. 

which they are well informed, by some who have been 
a number of years in the army. They would then think 
it no hardship to be subject to the punishments and fa- 
tigues. Were this done, and an order given by the 
Committee empowering me to provide for them, accord- 
ing to the rules and customs of the army, I then shoul( 
know what I am about. I could do it without hesitation 
or fear, and, I am convinced, to the satisfaction and in- 
terest of the country. As the case now stands, we arc 
upon such an odd establishment, under such uncertaii 
regulations, and subject to so much inconvenience, that 
I am wandering hi a wilderness of difficulties, and am 
ignorant of the ways to extricate myself, and to act for 
the satisfaction of the country, the soldiers, or myself. 
Having no certain rules for the direction of my conduct, 
I am afraid to turn to this hand or to that, lest it should 
be censured. If such an order, as I before spoke of, 
were to issue from your Board, I would then immedi- 
ately provide upon the best terms a quantity of all kinds 
of ammunition and clothes for the use of the regiment, 
and deliver them out to each company, as their wants 
required, taking care to deduct the value of all such 
things from their pay. By these means the soldiers 
would be always provided and fit for duty, and would 
do it cheerfully, and the country sustain no other loss, 
than advancing the money for a few months to lay in 
those stores, as this money would always be restored 
by the soldiers again.* 

I have hitherto been afraid to advance any sums of 
money for this salutary purpose, and have always bought 
the articles at extravagant prices, and been obliged to 
send to different parts, ere they could be had, which 

* These requests, in regard to the soldiers, were so far complied with, 
that they afterwards received full pay without any stoppage for their 
clothing. 



PART I.] THE FRENCH WAR. 177 

has also contributed to cause the nakedness of the sol- 
diers. The officers are almost as uneasy and dispirited 
as the men, doing every part of duty with languor and 
indifference. When ordered to provide themselves 
with suitable necessaries, they complain of an uncertain 
establishment, and the probability of being disbanded, 
and the things rendered useless. So that I really and 
most heartily wish for a change. The surgeon has en- 
treated me to mention his case, which I shall do by 
enclosing his letters. He has behaved extremely well, 
and discharged his duty, in every capacity, Since he 
came to the regiment. He has long discovered an in- 
clination to quit the service, the encouragement being so 
small ; and I Relieve he would have done it, had not the 
officers, to show their regard and willingness to detain 
him, subscribed each one day's pay in every month. 
This, as they are likely to be so much dispersed, and 
can receive no benefit from him, they intend to with- 
draw, and therefore he begs me to solicit the gentlemen 
of the Committee in his behalf; otherwise he will be 
obliged to seek some other method of getting his live- 
lihood. 

I beg, Sir, with very great earnestness, that the 
gentlemen of the Committee will communicate their 
sentiments fully upon all these several matters, and ap- 
prove or disapprove every thing therein. I only wait to 
know their intention, and then to act in strict conformity 
with it. 

If the Committee find my account satisfactory and 
distinct, as I have no doubt they will, it would be con- 
ferring a great obligation, if they would make a final 
settlement to that date, and begin a new account, as it 
would be the means of keeping matters more clear and 
intelligible hereafter. Long accounts, and references to 
doubtful points, instead of gaining any light, are but

darkened and confused by procrastination. The late 
regulation of our companies will occasion more regularity 
in the paymaster's account, and be more satisfactory in 
every shape, for the future. Besides, the gentlemen of 
the Committee will find little trouble, or difficulty, in 
looking over a short account, kept in a regular method, 
plain and perspicuous, which is the very life of business. 
I would again entreat your regard to my request, for 
these and many other reasons.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 14 August, 1756. 

SIR, 

The return of the express, that came with the account 
of La Force's escape, (for which accident I am ex- 
tremely concerned, and fear its consequences if he is 
not retaken,) affords me an opportunity to inform you 
of some occurrences, which have happened since my 
last* 

Repeated complaints and applications from all quar- 
ters for men, but more especially from the garrisons, 
which secure the communication with Fort Cumberland, 
obliged me to order a company from Captain Wag- 

* La Force, it will be remembered, was one of the prisoners taken in 
the skirmish with Jumonville's party. He was capable, enterprising, ac- 
tive, and had been instrumental, before his capture, in exciting the Indians 
to commit depredations on the frontiers. This was deemed a sufficient 
reason, by the Governor of Virginia, for retaining him in custody, contrary 
to the articles of capitulation at the Great Meadows. He was thrown into 
the jail at Williamsburg. From this abode, after more than two years' 
confinement, he had the address to escape, but was seized before he 
had advanced far into the country, remanded to prison, and loaded with 
ii\;ns. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 179 

gener*s detachment (for none else could spare a man) 
to reinforce and enable those garrisons to send escorts 
with wagons and expresses, going to and returning from 
that fort. Captain Waggener's command was thus re- 
duced to a number insufficient to disperse parties among 
the settlers, and retain a strength to conduct the build- 
ing of the forts. The grand point then turned on this ; 
whether he was to neglect the inhabitants and build the 
forts, or neglect the forts and protect the inhabitants. 

His council were of the latter opinion unanimously, 
and sent to know my sentiments, which I own corre- 
sponded with theirs, and for these reasons. First, I look 
upon it, that the protection of the inhabitants was the 
motive for ordering these forts ; and to lose them, while 
we are at work, would be perverting the intention. 
Secondly, we have built some forts and altered others, 
as far south on the Potomac waters as any settlers have 
been molested ; and there only remains one body of in- 
habitants, at a place called the Upper Tract, who need 
a guard. Thither I have ordered a party. Beyond 
this, if I am not misinformed, there is nothing but a con- 
tinued series of mountains uninhabited, until we get 
over to the waters of James River, not far from the fort, 
which takes its name from your Honor; and thence to 
Mayo River. Captain Hogg, by your orders, is to have 
the direction. If I have done amiss, in not adhering to 
the letter of the law, I hope you will intimate the same, 
and give directions how I am to proceed. 

Two or three men have been killed and scalped at 
different places, since my last, though every precaution 
has been taken to prevent it. The fatiguing service, 
low pay, and great hardships in which our men have 
been engaged, cause, notwithstanding the greatest care 
and vigilance to the contrary, great and scandalous de- 
sertions. Yesterday I received an account, from Cap- 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [>ET. 24. 

tain Stewart, of sixteen men deserting in a party. 
Frequently two or three went off before, as they have 
done from this place. We never fail to pursue, and use 
all possible means to apprehend them ; but seldom with 
success, as they are generally aided and assisted by the 
inhabitants. Two parties are now in pursuit of these 
fellows, who have made towards the northward to en- 
list with the recruiting officers in Pennsylvania. Unless 
a stop can be put to it, I fear we shall lose numbers of 
our men. 

A report prevailed in town yesterday, said to come 
from a man, who had it from a person that was at Gov- 
ernor Morris's treaty with the Indians, and heard them 
say, that a large body composed of different nations, and 
headed by some French, intended to attack Fort Cum- 
berland this fall. Reports of this kind often take rise 
without good foundation ; yet, as this is an affair of great 
importance, the slightest intelligence ought not to be 
discountenanced, especially when we consider that our 
provision, and, what is still more valuable, all our ammu- 
nition and stores, are lodged in that defenceless place. 
The consequence of a successful enterprise of this sort, 
and the absolute impossibility (considering the weakness 
of the place, badness of situation, and division of our 
force) of preventing its falling, are, without previous 
notice, motives sufficient for apprehending the worst. 
Therefore, notwithstanding I enlarged upon this subject 
in a former letter, I think it my duty to hint it again, and 
to ask directions how I am to proceed. 

It is true, I give no credit to this intelligence, because 
I flatter myself such important information as this would 
be communicated, in the most distinct and expeditious 
manner, by Governor Morris ; yet, it being an expedi- 
tion they cannot fail of succeeding in, what should deter 
them from attempting it ? We have certain advice, that

two of our deserters have reached Fort Duquesne, who 
were heard to speak in high terms, before they escaped, 
of the reward that would be got for communicating the 
weakness of the works and garrison at Fort Cumber- 
land. 

As a general meeting of all the persons concerned in 
the estate of my deceased brother* is appointed to be 
held at Alexandria, about the middle of September next, 
for making a final settlement of all his affairs, and as I 
am very deeply interested, not only as an executor, and 
heir of part of his estate, but also in a very important 
dispute, subsisting between Colonel Lee, who married 
the widow, and my brothers and self, concerning a de- 
vise in the will, which brings the whole personal estate 
in question, I say, as this is a matter of very great 
moment to me, I hope your Honor will readily consent 
to my attending this meeting, provided no disadvantage 
is likely to arise during my absence ; in which case, I 
shall not offer to quit my command. 

If war is to be declared at this place, I should be glad 
if your Honor would direct the manner. I know there 
is ceremony required, but the order I am ignorant of.f 

I am, &,c.

Majesty's health and a successful war."

TO LORD FAIRFAX.* 

Winchester, 29 August, 1756. 

MY LORD, 

It is with infinite concern, that I see the distresses o 
the people, and hear their complaints, without being 
able to afford them relief. I have so often troubled you 
for aid from the militia, that I am almost ashamed to re- 
peat my demands ; nor should I do it again, did I not 
think it absolutely necessary at this time to save the 

* Thomas, the sixth Lord Fairfax, possessed by inheritance a large 
tract of land in what was called the Northern Neck of Virginia, between 
the Potomac and Rappahannoc Rivers, estimated to contain five millions 
seven hundred thousand acres. For a time he employed his relative, Wil- 
liam Fairfax, as agent to manage these lands, and, about the year 1739, 
he came himself over to Virginia. He stayed a year, and went back to 
England. Four years afterwards, that is, in 1745, he returned to Vir- 
ginia, where he passed the remainder of his days. He resided several 
years in the family of Mr. William Fairfax, at Belvoir. At length he de- 
termined to establish himself on the western side of the Blue Ridge, where 
he built a house, called Greenway Court, a few miles from Winchester, 
laid out a beautiful farm, and put it under high cultivation. Here he lived 
in the exercise of a plain but generous and elegant hospitality till his death, 
which happened in January or February, 1782, in his ninety-second year. 

In this retreat Lord Fairfax devoted himself to the management of the 
large tracts of land, of which he was the proprietor, and also to the dis- 
charge of such public offices, as rendered him useful to his neighbourhood. 
He was lieutenant of the county of Frederic, presided in the county courts 
at Winchester, and was overseer of the public roads. He was remarked 
for some peculiar traits of character, and was fond of the chase and other 
active amusements ; but his mind was highly cultivated, and his literary 
taste and accomplishments were considerable. As a proof of this, it is 
enough to refer to Dr. Burnaby's statement, who says, that in his youthful 
days he was a contributor to the SPECTATOR. He was greatly esteemed 
by his intimate friends, and died much lamented. 

His barony descended to his only surviving brother, Robert Fairfax, 
who was the seventh Lord Fairfax, and who died at Leeds Castle, in Eng- 
land, 1791. The title next fell upon Bryan Fairfax, of Towlston Hall, in 
Virginia, who was the eighth and last Lord Fairfax, and who died August 
7th, 1802, at the age of seventy-five. During the latter years of his life, 
he was a clergyman of the Episcopal Church. Burnaby's Travels in 
America, 3d edition, p. 159.

most valuable and flourishing part of this county from 
immediate desertion. And how soon the remaining 
part, as well as the adjacent counties, may share the 
same fate, is but too obvious to reason, and to your 
Lordship's good sense. The whole settlement of Cono- 
cocheague in Maryland is fled, and there now remain 
only two families from thence to Fredericktown, w r hich 
is several miles below the Blue Ridge. We are thus 
quite exposed, and have no better security on that side, 
than the Potomac River, for many miles below the She- 
nandoah ; and how great a security that is to us, may 
easily be discerned, when we consider, with what facility 
the enemy have passed and repassed it already. That 
the Maryland settlements are all abandoned is certainly 
a fact, as I have had the accounts transmitted to me by 
several hands, and confirmed yesterday by Henry 
Brinker, who left Monocosy the day before, and who 
also affirms, that three hundred and fifty wagons had 
passed that place to avoid the enemy, within the space 
of three days. 

I thought it expedient to communicate this intelli- 
gence, that your Lordship may know the reasons for 
asking succours for these unhappy people, and how 
absolutely necessary it is to use, without delay, such 
vigorous measures as will save that settlement from 
total desolation. 

We see, my Lord, the absurdity of the people's ar- 
guments, and the consequences of leaving one county, 
nay, one part of a county, or, to go still farther, a single 
company, that is more exposed than another, to defend 
itself and the parts in danger. When Hampshire was 
invaded, and called on Frederic for assistance, the peo- 
ple of the latter refused their aid, answering, " Let them 
defend themselves, as we shall do if they come to us." 
Now that the enemy have forced through that county, 



184 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 24. 

and begin to infest this, those a little removed from dan- 
ger are equally infatuated ; and it will thus be, I fear, 
until all in turn fall a sacrifice to an insulting and merci- 
less enemy. 

These observations may be improperly offered to 
your Lordship, but they occur in so strong a light to 
me, that I could not resist the impulse to make them. 
I am so weak-handed here, that I cannot, without stop- 
ping the public works, spare a man to these people's 
assistance. Yet I look upon the retaining of them to be 
so essential to the well-being of the county in general, 
that I have ordered all the men, that can possibly be 
spared, to march thitherwards ; and they will accord- 
ingly set out to-morrow morning, to remain there until 
your Lordship can relieve them, that they may return to 
these works, which in my opinion are of no little impor- 
tance to the safety of the county, if we should be attacked 
by numbers, as we have reason to apprehend. I hope 
your Lordship will exert your authority in raising men 
for this salutary end, and that you will think it advisable 
to make every company furnish its quota. This will 
remove the complaints of the people below, who say 
they cannot leave their families to the mercy of the 
enemy, while they are scouring the woods. 

This is the reason given by some why Caton's party 
consists of but ten men, while others say it proceeds 
from dislike to the man. I acquainted the Governor 
with your Lordship's order for raising fifty men for this 
service, who approved it, and has been pleased to direct 
me to continue them as long as I see cause. 

I cannot conclude without again mentioning how 
agreeable it would be, if your Lordship would order a 
party immediately to those parts, that I may withdraw 
my men to their duty at this place. 

I am, my Lord, &c.

TO GOVERNOR DEVWIDDIE. 

Mount Vernon, 23 September, 1756. 

SIR, 

Under your kind indulgence I came to this place a 
few days ago, expecting to meet the executors of my 
deceased brother, in order to make a final settlement of 
his affairs. I was disappointed in this design, by the 
Assembly having called away the principal persons con- 
cerned. 

I shall remark, in obedience to your request, such 
things relating to the Virginia regiment as occur to me 
now, and require the Assembly's attention ; and if any 
thing further presents itself, I shall communicate it from 
Winchester, for which place I shall set out this after- 
noon. I have often urged, for one thing, the necessity 
of enforcing the articles of war in all their parts, where 
it is not incompatible with the nature of this service. I 
have been surprised, as often as I have reflected upon this 
subject, and really cannot devise any reason, why the 
Assembly should be so much averse to fixed rules for 
the regulation of their forces, of which long experience 
in established armies fully evinces the necessity. My 
surprise is yet increased, when I consider how cautiously 
worded the act of Parliament is, to preserve the rights 
and liberties of the people against the arbitrary pro- 
ceedings of the military officers. 

We are under a kind of regulation at present, that 
renders command extremely difficult and precarious, as 
no crimes, I believe, are particularly noticed in the act 
of Assembly, except mutiny and desertion, notwith- 
standing there are many others equally punishable by 
act of Parliament. 

One thing 'more, which particularly requires atten- 
tion, is the billeting, quartering, and dieting of soldiers

ipon the inhabitants, which in many cases cannot be 
avoided. 

I have, in several letters to your Honor, expressed 
my opinion with candor and freedom, about the situa- 
tion, works, and garrison at Fort Cumberland. I shall, 
nevertheless, as you command me to lay before you 
such things as require the Assembly's notice, repeat on 
this occasion my fears once more for that place, that I 
may avoid, if any accident should happen to it, the ma- 
licious reflections, which inseparably attend misfortunes 
of this kind. I have upon all occasions said, that Fort 
Cumberland is a place of no strength, and never can be 
tenable from the badness of the ground. It is far remote 
from any of our inhabitants, exposed to the insults of 
the enemy, contains all our valuable stores (save what 
I have removed to Winchester), and a garrison of one 
hundred and seventy men, which is too large a number 
to be spared from other places, merely to defend the 
stores at this, and too small to afford detachments to 
waylay and surprise the enemy. I shall, therefore, beg 
leave to observe, in regard to Fort Cumberland, that if 
it is continued, we must be confined to act defensively, 
and keep our forces dispersed as they now are. The 
place must be fortified with strong works, or else it will 
inevitably fall, garrison and stores, into the enemy's 
hands. I enclose Colonel Stephen's letter on this head, 
in answer to one I wrote to him. 

I did, from the beginning, express my sentiments 
against having small garrisons in a chain of forts along 
our frontiers. We have a frontier of such immense ex- 
tent, that to build forts at convenient distances would 
employ such numbers of men, and divide our troops 
into such trifling parties, that no one part could defend it- 
self, much less the inhabitants, were the country invaded. 

The most effectual way that I can see, though none 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 187 

can answer while we act defensively, is to have no more 
than three or four large, strong forts, built at convenient 
distances, upon our frontiers ; in which strong garrisons 
must be maintained, that parties able to cope with the 
enemy may be sent out, and these parties kept in con- 
stant succession ranging and scouring the country. 
Here a difficulty will arise, as others will in every de- 
fensive plan, that can be offered. How are these rang- 
ing parties, sent out in this manner, and probably 
remaining on the scout from ten to fourteen days, to be 
supplied with provisions, the inhabitants being so thinly 
settled, and the forts so far extended? The difficulty 
is great, yet not sufficient to render this plan inferior to 
the former. For in the other case, when the enemy is 
heard of, the garrison can only send out parties, more fit 
to reconnoitre than oppose. These parties, if they 
prove too small (which in all probability they may), are 
certain of falling a prey to the enemy, whose numbers 
cannot be known until thus proved. I could urge many 
things more on this head, but believe it useless. What 
I have already said, I hope, is sufficient to give your 
Honor a hint of the matter, and that is all I aim at. We 
may form many schemes to defend ourselves, but experi- 
ence will show, that none but removing the cause of the 
difficulties will prove effectual. Unless the Assembly 
concerts some measures to augment their force, the coun- 
try, I fear, must inevitably fall. The frontiers, within 
twelve months, have been totally deserted for fifty miles 
and upwards from north to south, and all below that dis- 
tance greatly thinned by the removal of numbers ; occa- 
sioned in some measure by Maryland and Pennsylvania 
giving ground so much faster than we do, which exposes 
a very fine country of ours on that side, as low as Mon- 
ocosy in Maryland, several miles on this side of the 
Blue Ridge. 



188 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 24. 

I believe I might also add, that no person, who re- 
gards his character, will undertake a command without 
the means of preserving it ; since his conduct is culpable 
for all misfortunes, and never right but when successful. 

I cannot think any number under two thousand men 
sufficient to cover our extensive frontiers, and with that 
number it would be impossible to prevent misfortunes, 
however easy the world may think it. What means can 
be used to raise these men, I know not, unless the en- 
listing of servants is thought expedient; and that alone 
will prove ineffectual. Some determination should be 
had about the ranging companies. Under what regula- 
tions those are in Augusta, and what service they have 
done the country, I know not. Those in this quarter 
have done little, and both companies amount to about 
thirty men only at this time. I apprehend it will be 
thought advisable to keep a garrison always at Fort 
Loudoun ; for which reason I would beg leave to repre- 
sent the number of tippling-houses in Winchester as a 
great nuisance to the soldiers, who, by this means, in 
despite of the utmost care and vigilance, are, so long as 
their pay holds out, incessantly drunk, and unfit for 
service. 

The rates of their liquor are immoderately high, and 
the publicans throughout the country charge one shilling 
a meal, currency, for soldier's diet; and the country 
only allows the recruiting officer eight pence a day for 
the maintenance of a soldier, by which means he loses 
in proportion as he obtains men, which is much com- 
plained of, and is in reality a discouraging circumstance 
demanding redress. The want of a chaplain, I humbly 
conceive, reflects dishonor on the regiment, as all other 
officers are allowed. The gentlemen of the corps are 
sensible of this, and proposed to support one at their 
private expense. But I think it w r ould have a more

graceful appearance were he appointed as others are. 
I could wish some method were practised to bring the 
commonalty acquainted with the laws against entertain- 
ing deserters, and to enforce those laws. 

An officer of the American Regiment is recruiting at 
Alexandria, and purposes to go through the country, 
and pass into Carolina. He has enlisted some servants, 
and intends to take all he can meet with. This, I be- 
lieve, may evince the necessity of our following his 
example, otherwise we shall suffer our .colony to be 
weakened without receiving any immediate advantage ; 
though I imagine the expense will be nearly the same 
to the country, whether they are in the Bang's or coun- 
try's service. 

I am, with all due respect, your Honor's, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Halifax, 10 October, 1756. 

SIR, 

This day within five miles of the Carolina line, as I 
was proceeding to the southernmost fort in Halifax, I 
met Major Lewis on his return from the Cherokees, 
with seven men and three women only of that nation. 
The causes of this unhappy disappointment I have de- 
sired him to communicate, that you may take measures 
accordingly. * This account is sent by express, to give 
the earliest notice while the Assembly is sitting. 

I shall defer going into a particular detail of my ob- 
servations on the situation of our frontiers, until I return 
to Winchester, as I expect by that time to be more inti- 

* There had been sanguine expectations, that four hundred Cherokee 
Indians would join the Virginia forces ; and it was supposed, that Major 
Lewis would return with that number. 



190 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mi. 24. 

mately acquainted with the unhappy circumstances of 
the people. Yet I shall not omit mentioning some oc- 
currences, which have happened in my tour to this 
place. I wrote to you from Winchester, that I should 
set out the next day for Augusta. I accordingly did so, 
September 29th, with Captain M c Neil ; and hearing at 
the Court-House, that the Indians still continued their 
. depredations, although not so openly as at first, 1 applied 
to Colonel Stewart, then present, to raise a party of the 
militia, and proposed to head them myself, march to 
Jackson's River, scour the woods, and, if possible, fall in 
with the enemy. He gave me very little encourage- 
ment to expect any men, yet desired I would wait four 
days, till Monday, and he would use his endeavours to 
collect a body. Until Tuesday I waited, and only five 
men appeared. This being too inconsiderable a num- 
ber to expose to a triumphant enemy, I was advised to 
apply to Colonel Buchanan for men, between whom and 
Colonel Stewart there was contention about command. 

Colonel Buchanan resided at Luney's Ferry, on James 
River, sixty miles along the road to Vass's, on the Roan- 
oke, w r here Captain Hogg was building a fort, and to 
which place I intended to proceed, if I could get men 
to range along the frontiers with me. I set out imme- 
diately for his house, attended by Captain Preston, who 
was kind enough to be my conductor; and I acquainted 
the Colonel with the motives that brought me thither. 
He told me with very great concern, that it was not in 
his power to raise men; for that, three days before, some 
of the militia, in a fort, about fifteen miles above his 
house, at the head of Catawba Creek, commanded by 
one Colonel Nash, were attacked by the Indians, which 
occasioned all that settlement to break up totally, even 
as far as the ferry at Luney's ; that he had ordered 
three companies to repair thither, and march against the 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 191 

enemy, and not one man came, except a captain, lieu- 
tenant, and seven or eight men from Bedford. 

Finding that it was impossible to get a party to range 
and scour the frontiers, it remained only to proceed 
without men to see the situation of the forts, or to re- 
turn back. The latter I was loath to do, since I had 
come thus far, and was anxious to see what posture of 
defence they were in. I therefore determined to come 
forward, at least to Vass's, and accordingly set out in 
company with Colonel Buchanan, who, being desirous 
that I might see and relate their unhappy condition, un- 
dertook to accompany me. We arrived safely at Vass's, 
where Captain Hogg, with only eighteen of his company, 
was building a fort, which must employ him till Christ- 
mas, without more assistance. One Captain Hunt from 
Lunenburg, was there with thirty men ; but none of 
them would strike a stroke, unless I would engage to 
see them paid forty pounds of tobacco a day, which is 
provided by act of Assembly for militia carpenters. 
This I certainly could not do, as your Honor, who I 
thought had ordered them purposely out for this duty, 
had given no directions in the affair. Whatever expec- 
tations your Honor may have had from the militia's 
assistance, I am told they never lent a hand, save a few, 
that first came out with Captain Hogg, whom he has 
paid after the same rates with our men, at sixpence a 
day. Vass's place is a pass of very great importance, 
affording a road for the enemy, but secure, if strongly 
garrisoned. 

From Vass's I came off with a servant and a guide, 
to visit the range of forts in this county. In less than 
two hours after, two men were killed along the same 
road, as will appear by Captain M c Neil's letter, which I 
have just received, and herewith send, to let you see, 
by the account of Captain Hunt's behaviour, what de- 



192 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T. 24. 

pendence may be put on the militia. The inhabitants 
are so sensible of their danger, if left to the protection 
of these people, that not a man will stay at his place. 
This I have from their own mouths, and the principal 
persons of Augusta county. The militia are under such 
bad order and discipline, that they will go and come 
when and where they please, without regarding time, 
their officers, or the safety of the inhabitants, consulting 
solely their own inclinations. There should be, accord- 
ing to your orders, one third of the militia of these parts 
now on duty at once ; instead of that, I believe scarce 
one thirtieth is out. They are to be relieved every 
month. More than that time is taken up in marching 
to and from their stations, and they will not wait one 
day longer than the limited time, whether they are re- 
lieved or not, let the necessity for it be* ever so urgent. 
An instance of this kind happened in my presence about 
four days ago, in the case of Captain Daniel from Albe- 
marle, who was intreated by Colonel Buchanan to stay 
at the time he was gathering or attempting to gather 
men, upon the alarm at the Catawba settlement before 
mentioned. The Captain's month was out, and go he 
must and did. Nay, I believe I may venture to say, 
that, whether his month had been out or not, this cir- 
cumstance would have induced him to go; for the same 
gentleman went away from Vass's, because he thought 
it a dangerous post, giving that for his reason, and left 
Captain Hogg with eighteen men, exposed to the insults 
of the enemy. 

Perhaps it may be thought I am partial in my relation, 
and reflect unjustly. I really do not, Sir. I scorn to 
make unjust remarks on the behaviour of the militia, as 
much as I despise and contemn the persons, who de- 
tract from mine and the character of the regiment. 
Were it not, that I consult the good of the public, 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 193 

and think these garrisons merit attention, I should not 
deem it worth mentioning. I only wish to make the 
country sensible, how ardently I have studied to pro- 
mote its cause, and desire very sincerely, that my suc- 
cessor may fill my place more to its satisfaction in every 
respect, than I have been able to do. I mentioned in 
my last, that I did not think a less number than two 
thousand men would be sufficient to defend our exten- 
sive and much exposed frontiers from the ravages of 
the enemy. I have not had one reason to alter my 
opinion, but many to strengthen and confirm it. And I 
flatter myself, that the country will, when my determi- 
nations are known, be convinced that I have no sinister 
views, no vain motives of commanding a number of men, 
which urge me to recommend this number, but that it 
proceeds from the knowledge I have acquired of the 
country and people to be defended. 

Your Honor, I hope, will give directions about laying 
in provisions on our southern frontiers. It is not in my 
pow r er to do it, as I know not what troops can or will be 
put there. The regiment is at present too weak to 
allow any men to march from the quarter in which they 
are now stationed. I shall set out this day on my re- 
turn to the fort, at the head of Catawba Creek, where 
Colonel Buchanan promised to meet me with a party to 
conduct me along our frontiers, up Jackson's River to 
Fort Dinwiddie, and higher if needful. If he does not 
meet me, I shall immediately proceed to Winchester, 
as it will be impossible to do any thing without men. 

If you think proper to advance the pay of the militia, 
in order to engage them to work, please to acquaint 
Captain Hogg therewith, and send him money for that 
purpose. Were more men ordered to cover his party, 
and assist in the work, it would be highly advanta- 
geous, for he is greatly exposed. Major Lewis is ex-

given a plain account of all the several matters men- 
tioned in the foregoing sheet. I am, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Winchester, 9 November, 1756. 

SIR, 

In mine from Halifax I promised a particular detail of 
my observations upon the situation of our frontiers, 
when I arrived at this place. Although I was pretty 
explicit in that letter, I cannot avoid recapitulating part 
of the subject now. 

From Fort Trial on Smith's River, I returned to Fort 
William on the Catawba, where I met Colonel Buchanan 
with about thirty men, chiefly officers, to conduct me up 
Jackson's River, along the range of forts. With this 
small company of irregulars, with whom order, regu- 
larity, circumspection, and vigilance were matters of 
derision and contempt, we set out, and, by the protec- 
tion of Providence, reached Augusta Court-House in 
seven days, without meeting the enemy ; otherwise we 
must have fallen a sacrifice, through the indiscretion of 
these whooping, hallooing gentlemen soldiers ! 

This jaunt afforded me an opportunity of seeing the 
bad regulation of the militia, the disorderly proceedings 
of the garrisons, and the unhappy circumstances of the 
inhabitants. 

First, of the militia. The difficulty of collecting them 
on any emergency, I have often spoken of; and I appeal 
to sad experience, how great a disadvantage it is, that 
the enemy should have every opportunity to plunder, 
kill, and escape, before the militia can afford any assis- 
tance. And not to mention the expensiveness of their 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 195 

service in general, I can instance several cases, where a 
captain, lieutenant, and, I may add, an ensign, with two 
or three sergeants, and six or eight men, will go upon 
duty at a time. The proportion of expense in this case 
is so unjust and obvious, that your Honor wants it not 
to be proved. 

Then these men, when raised, are to be continued 
only one month on duty, half of which time is lost in 
their marching out and home, especially those from the 
adjacent counties, who must be on duty some time be- 
fore they reach their stations, by which means double 
sets of men are in pay at the same time, and for the 
same service. Again, the waste of provision they make 
is unaccountable ; no method or order in being served 
or purchasing at the best rates, but quite the reverse. 
Allowance for each man, as in the case of other soldiers, 
they look upon as the highest indignity, and would 
sooner starve, than carry a few days' provision on their 
backs for conveniency. But upon their march, when 
breakfast is wanted, they knock down the first beef 
they meet with, and, after regaling themselves, march 
on till dinner, when they take the same method, and so 
for supper, to the great oppression of the people. Or, 
if they chance to impress cattle for provision, the valua- 
tion is left to ignorant and interested neighbours, who 
have suffered by those practices, and, despairing of their 
pay, exact high prices, and thus the public is imposed 
upon at all events. I might add, I believe, that, for the 
want of proper laws to govern the militia (I cannot as- 
cribe it to any other cause), they are obstinate, self- 
willed, perverse, of little or no service to the people, 
and very burthensome to the country. Every individual 
has his own crude notions of things, and must undertake 
to direct. If his advice is neglected, he thinks himself 
slighted, abused, and injured ; and, to redress his 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [M-r. 24. 

wrongs, will depart for his home. These, Sir, are liter- 
ally matters of fact, partly from persons of undoubted 
veracity, but chiefly from my own observations. 

Secondly, concerning the garrisons. I found them 
very weak for want of men ; but more so from indolence 
and irregularity. I saw none in a posture of defence, 
and few that might not be surprised with the greatest 
ease. An instance of this appeared at Dickinson's Fort, 
where the Indians ran down, caught several children 
playing under the walls, and had got to the gate before 
they were discovered. Was not Vass's Fort surprised, 
and a good many souls lost, in the same manner ? They 
keep no guard, but just when the enemy is about, and 
they are under fearful apprehensions ; nor ever stir out 
of the forts, from the time they reach them, till relieved 
on their month being expired ; at which time they 
march off, be the event what it will. Of the ammunition 
they are as careless as of the provisions, firing it away 
frequently at targets for wagers. On our journey, as 
we approached one of their forts, we heard a quick fire 
for several minutes, and concluded for certain that they 
were attacked ; so we marched in the best manner to 
their relief ; but when we came up, we found they were 
diverting themselves at marks. These men afford no 
assistance to the unhappy settlers, who are driven from 
their plantations, either in securing their harvests, or 
gathering their corn. Lieutenant Bullitt, commanding 
at Fort Cumberland, sent to Major Lewis of Albemarle, 
who commanded a party of sixty militia at Miller's, 
about fifteen miles above him, where were also thirty 
men of Augusta, for some men to join his small parties 
to gather the corn. Major Lewis refused assistance, 
and would not divide his men. I wrote to him, but got 
no answer. Mr. Bullitt has done what he could with 
his few men, not quite thirty. Of the many forts, which 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 197 

I passed by, I saw but one or two that had their cap- 
tains present, they being absent chiefly on their own 
business, and had given leave to several of the men to 
do the same. Yet these persons, I will venture to say, 
will charge the country their full month's pay. 

Thirdly, the wretched and unhappy situation of the 
inhabitants needs few words, after a slight reflection on 
the preceding circumstances. They are fully sensible 
of their misery ; they feel their insecurity in relying on 
militia, who are slow in coming to their assistance, in- 
different about their preservation, unwilling to continue, 
and regardless of every thing but their own ease. In 
short, they are so affected with approaching ruin, that 
the whole back country is in a general motion towards 
the southern colonies ; and I expect that scarce a family 
will inhabit Frederic, Hampshire, or Augusta, in a little 
time. They petitioned me in the most earnest manner 
for companies of the regiment. But alas ! it is not in 
my power to assist them with any, unless I leave this 
dangerous quarter more exposed than they are. I 
promised, at their particular request, to address your 
Honor and the Assembly in their behalf, that a regular 
force may be established in lieu of the militia and rang- 
ing companies, which are of much less service, and of 
infinitely more cost to the country. Were this done, 
the whole w r ould be under one direction, and any mis- 
behaviour could never pass with impunity. Whereas 
the others are soldiers at will. And, indeed, the man- 
ner in which some of the ranging captains have obtained 
their commissions, if I am rightly informed, is by impos- 
ture and artifice. They produce a list, I am told, to 
your Honor, of sundry persons, who are willing to serve 
under them. One part, it is said, consists of fictitious 
names ; another, the names of persons who never saw 
the list ; and the remainder are persons drawn into it 



Q* 



198 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEr. 24. 

by fallacious promises, that cannot be performed with- 
out detriment to the service. But were it otherwise, 
surely any person, who considers the pay of the soldiers 
and that of the militia, will find a considerable differ- 
ence, though both under the best regulations. 

As defensive measures are evidently insufficient for 
the security and safety of the country, I hope no argu- 
ments are requisite to prove the necessity of altering 
them to a vigorous offensive war, in order to remove 
the evil. But, should the Assembly still indulge that 
favorite scheme of protecting the inhabitants by forts 
along the frontiers, in which too many of them put their 
dependence, and as the building of these forts has been 
encouraged and confirmed by an act of Assembly, I 
take the liberty to present your Honor with a plan of 
the number of forts, and strength necessary to each, 
reaching entirely across our frontiers from north to 
south. This plan is calculated upon the most moderate 
and easy terms for sparing expense to the country, and, 
I believe, with tolerable propriety to answer the wished- 
for design of protecting the settlers. Besides, most of 
the forts are already built by the country-people or sol- 
diers, and require but little improvement, save one or 
two, as Dickinson's and Cox's. Your Honor will see 
Fort Cumberland excluded in this list. * 

The advantage of having the militia in Augusta 
under one command, I have already hinted at ; and I 
think Major Lewis should have your Honor's orders 
to take that duty in hand, with directions to secure 



* This scheme embraced a line of twenty-three forts, extending along 1 
the whole frontier of Virginia, from the Potomac River to the borders of 
North Carolina. The number of men required to garrison the whole was 
estimated at two thousand. The project of a chain of forts, as has been 
seen, was not a favorite one with Colonel Washington ; but he had formed 
this plan in compliance with the views of the Assembly. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 199 

those important passes of Dickinson's and Vass's, by 
building a fort in the neighbourhood of Dickinson's, or 
by some other means. Were it practicable to get the 
people to assemble in little towns contiguous to these 
forts, it would contribute much to their mutual peace 
and safety, during the continuance of the Indian war. 
The Augusta people complain greatly for want of 
money. 

The other day eleven Indians of the Catawba tribe 
came here, and we undoubtedly might have had more 
of them, had the proper means been used to send trusty 
guides to invite and conduct them to us ; but this is neg- 
lected. One Matthew Tool makes his boast of stopping 
them until he shall be handsomely rewarded for bring- 
ing them ; and Major Lewis can inform you of one 
Bemer, who uses every method to hinder the Chero- 
kees from coming to our assistance. Complaint should 
be made to Governor Littleton of these persons. In- 
dian goods are much wanted to reward the Catawbas, 
and encourage them to engage in our service. 

Your Honor and the Assembly should determine 
several essential points ; namely, a proper method of 
paying rewards for taking up deserters, the present 
one being very discouraging, as it delays payment until 
Courts of Claims have decided ; means to replace the 
drafts, that must be discharged in December; ascer- 
taining the pay of workmen employed on all public 
works, or empowering the commanding officer to agree 
on the cheapest terms he can with them ; how the mas- 
ters of servants enlisted for the Virginia regiment are to 
be paid. We have already recruited more than fifty, 
and are daily dunned for payment by the masters. A 
report prevails, to my great surprise, though disbelief, 
that your Honor had told some persons, who ap- 
plied to you for satisfaction for their servants, that I had 



200 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [>ET. 24. 

no orders to enlist any. This false rumor occasions 
strange reflections, and must make me appear in a very 
unjust light to the world. I have, therefore, desisted 
from recruiting until you direct me in what manner 
those already obtained are to be paid for ; and I beg 
you will give me immediate advice on the affair, as the 
people are impatient, and threaten us with prosecutions 
from all quarters. 

Your Honor has herewith a copy of the council of 
war, held in behalf of Fort Cumberland, in which the 
arguments are justly and fully laid down, both with re- 
gard to Virginia in particular, and to the three colonies 
in general. * On the back of the copy are my senti- 
ments candidly offered, and to your Honor I leave the 
determination of this important affair, f 

As to a chaplain, if the government will grant a sub- 
sistence, we can readily get a person of merit to accept 
the place, without giving the commissary any trouble on 
that point. I 

* That is, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. 

f In a former letter Governor Dinwiddie had proposed to Colonel Wash- 
ington, that the affair of Fort Cumberland should be referred to a council 
of officers, to be held at that place. This had been done, and the council 
had reported at large, assigning the reasons, which might be urged both 
for retaining and for abandoning the fort, but forbore to express a decided 
opinion. Colonel Washington approved their report, and, after adding his 
remarks, he | forwarded the whole to the Governor. The council agreed, 
that the fort itself was wholly defenceless, imperfectly constructed, and 
commanded by several hills within gun-shot; but they thought it important 
that a post should be maintained in that quarter, since the only road to the 
west for wheel-carriages passed in that direction. 

With this view of the subject Colonel Washington concurred, but was 
still of opinion, that a better position ought to be chosen, and suggested 
that it should be in advance of Fort Cumberland, and somewhere in the 
vicinity of the Little Meadows. This he thought a proper enterprise for 
the combined efforts of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, as the main 
object was to facilitate an expedition to the Ohio, or prevent an irruption 
of the enemy into either of those colonies. 

t In reply to a request for the appointment of a chaplain to the regi- 
ment, Governor Dinwiddie had written to him; " I have recommended

Your Honor has had advice of two spies, that were 
taken at Fort Cumberland ; one of whom they quickly 
hung up as his just reward, being a deserter ; the other 
was sent to Governor Sharpe, to give information of the 
infernal practices followed by some of the priests of that 
province, in holding correspondence with our enemy. 

I am, &,c. 

N. B. I am just setting out for Fort Cumberland. 



TO GOVERNOR D1NWIDDIE. 

Alexandria, 24 November, 1756. 

SIR, 

At this place, on my way to Williamsburg, I received 
your Honor's letter of the 16th instant.* I shall take 

to the commissary to get a chaplain, but he cannot prevail with any person 
to accept of it. I shall again press it to him." 

* For some reason, which does not appear, Governor Dinwiddie re- 
ceived the preceding letter in no very good humor. This will be manifest 
by the following extracts from his reply, which are requisite also to ex- 
plain some parts of Colonel Washington's rejoinder. 

" The abuses mentioned in yours I have been made acquainted with 
from several hands ; but I expected you would have been more particular 
in regard to the officers neglecting their duty, and the different forts not 
being properly garrisoned with men, nay, without their officers. This 
vague report makes it impossible for me to call on the delinquents." 

" I am of opinion the string of forts proposed is only weakening our 
strength, and will be a poor defence to our frontiers. I hope you will keep 
the Indians properly employed. Major Lewis has orders to send up the 
Cherokees. You seem to attribute neglect to me, in not having proper 
conductors. The charge is unmannerly, as I did what I thought proper, 
though disappointed by the villanous traders." 

" If you had sent down the amount of money due for the servants enlisted, 
I would have given a warrant for the money. It is probable I might have 
refused payment to the masters of some of the servants enlisted, for want 
of certificates, but never said you did not act properly in enlisting them." 

" In regard to a chaplain, you should know, that his qualification and the 
bishop's letter of license should be produced to the commissary and myself; 
but this person is also nameless. 

" I received the opinion of the council of war in regard to Fort Cumber-

care to pay the strictest obedience to your orders, and 
the opinion, so far as I can. The detachment ordered 
from Winchester exceeds, I believe, the number of en- 
listed men we have there ; and the drafts, that made 
our strength at that place to consist of about one hun- 
dred and sixty men, will leave us in seven days. I 
have no hope of enlisting any, nor of prolonging their 
stay, as we have heretofore engaged those, who were 
willing to serve. 

I am very sorry any expression in my letter should 
be deemed unmannerly. I never intended insults to 
any ; on the contrary, I have endeavoured to demean 
myself with the proper respect due to superiors. In 
the instance mentioned, I can truly say, so far from in- 
tending a charge or affront of any kind, it was distant 
from my thoughts ; and I meant no more than to show 
what strange, what unaccountable infatuation prevailed 
among the magistrates of the back parts of Carolina; 
who were so regardless of the common cause, as to al- 
low fifty Catawbas to return, when they had proceeded 
near seventy miles on their march, for want of pro- 
visions and a conductor to entice them along. This 
was a fact with which I did not suppose your Honor 
unacquainted, knowing Colonel Cobb had written to 



land ; as it was an affair of great consequence, 1 called the council for their 
advice. In consequence thereof, I hereby order you immediately to march 
one hundred men to Fort Cumberland from the forces you have at Win- 
chester, which, Captain Mercer says, are one hundred and sixty enlisted 
men. You are to remain at Fort Cumberland, and make the place as strong 
as you can in case of an attack. You are to send out parties from the fort 
to observe the motions of the enemy, if they should march over the Alle- 
gany mountains. Any stores at the fort, not absolutely necessary for its 
defence, you are to send to Winchester. 

" You are to order one of your subaltern officers, in whom you can con- 
fide, to command at Winchester, and to oversee the finishing of the fort 
building at that place. These orders I expect you will give due obedience 
to, and I am with respect," &c. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 203 

you on the subject. I therefore thought I might be 
less explicit, and not incur this censure by that means. 

I seem also to be reprimanded for giving a vague ac- 
count of my tour to the southward. I was rather fearful 
of blame for prolixity and impertinence, in meddling 
with matters with which I had no immediate concern ; 
and I related them rather as hints, to set you upon 
inquiring, than as a circumstantial account of the facts. 
This I chose more especially to do, as Colonels Lewis 
and Buchanan were there, from whom, being heads of 
the militia, these representations, fully authenticated, 
would more properly come. When I went to Augusta, 
it was with the good design to relieve, if possible, a 
much distressed settlement; but, finding this imprac- 
ticable without men, and hearing some complaints of 
Captain Hogg, and at the same time being desirous of 
seeing in what manner he proceeded, I continued onward 
in no small danger ; yet pleased with executing this ex- 
traordinary duty, and bringing myself more intimately 
acquainted with the situation of our frontiers, which, 
Sir, I related as well as I was capable, with a design, 
from which I have never intentionally swerved, to serve 
my country. And I am sorry to find, that this, and my 
best endeavours of late, meet with unfavorable con- 
structions. What it proceeds from, I know not. If my 
open and disinterested way of writing and speaking has 
the air of pertness and freedom, I shall correct my erroi 
by acting reservedly, and shall take care to obey my 
orders without offering any thing more. 

When I spoke of a chaplain, it was in answer to 
yours. I had no person in view, though many have 
offered ; and I only said, if the country would provide 
subsistence, we could procure a chaplain, without think- 
ing there was offence in the expression. 

So soon as I march from Winchester, which will be 



204 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [.Ex. 24. 

immediately, I shall write you a more distinct account 
of the situation of that place, which will be left entirely 
destitute of all protection, notwithstanding it now con- 
tains all the public stores of any importance, as they 
were removed from Fort Cumberland, and in the most 
dangerous part of our frontiers, at least in a part that 
has suffered this summer more than any (which has 
been so well secured) by the ravages of the enemy. 
The works, which have been constructed and carried 
on with infinite pains and labor, will be unfinished and 
exposed ; and the materials for completing the building, 
which have been collected with unspeakable difficulty 
and expense, left to be pillaged and destroyed by the 
inhabitants of the town ; because, as I before observed, 
one hundred men will exceed the number, I am pretty 
confident, which we shall have there, when the drafts 
go off. So, if I comply with my orders, which I shall 
literally do, if I can, not a man will be left there to se- 
cure the works, or defend the King's stores, which are 
almost wholly removed to that place. 

I am your Honor's, &.c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 2 December, 1756. 

SIR, 

When I wrote to 'you from Alexandria, I expected to 
have been at or near Fort Cumberland by this time; 
but, upon coming here, and expecting wagons and pro- 
visions in readiness to go up with this escort, 1 received 
the enclosed from the commissary, which I send to 
evince that no delays or protracting of orders proceed 
from me. The return of our strength, which I called in 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 205 

as soon as I arrived, is herewith sent, signed by the 
adjutant, amounting, exclusive of the drafts, to eighty- 
one effectives, including the sick, and young drummers, 
who were sent here to learn. 

When Captain Mercer went down, our strength con- 
sisted of about twenty-five more, including drafts, who 
have been sent over, since the middle of October, to 
Conococheague and Swearingham's Ferry, to encourage 
the inhabitants there to stay at their places, who other- 
wise were determined to forsake them. Your late and 
unexpected order has caused the utmost terror and 
consternation in the people, and will, I fear, be produc- 
tive of numberless evils, not only to this place, and the 
public works erecting here, but to the people in general, 
who seem to be in the greatest dread of the conse- 
quences. The stores of every kind have all been 
brought from Fort Cumberland, save those indispen- 
sably necessary there, at a very great expense, and lie 
in the court-house and other public buildings, to the no 
small inconvenience and detriment of the county. I 
have frequently been importuned by the members of 
the court, and other public officers, to remove them, and 
have as often by gentle persuasives protracted the time ; 
which was the more cheerfully granted, as it was evi- 
dent there were no other places to receive them, and 
that I strove with the utmost diligence to prepare the 
proper receptacles. What course to take now, I know 
not, and hope you will direct. 

I am convinced, were you informed how much this 
place (which is in every respect our extreme and 
most exposed frontier, there being no inhabitants be- 
tween this and the South Branch, and none there but 
such as are forted in,) I say, I am convinced, if you 
were truly informed of the situation of this place, of its 
importance and danger, you would not think it prudenl 

VOL. II. R 



206 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 24. 

to leave such a quantity of valuable stores exposed to 
the insults of a few ; for a very few indeed might reduce 
them and the town to ashes. In the next place, as I 
observed in my last letter, the works, which have been 
begun and continued with labor and hardship, lie open, 
untenable, and exposed to the weather, to say no more ; 
the materials, which have been collected with cost and 
infinite difficulty, will be at the mercy of every pillager ; 
our timber and scantling, used and burnt by the town's 
people ; our plank, which has been brought from afar, 
stolen and destroyed ; and the lime, if not stolen, left to 
be wasted. And this is not the worst. A building, 
which in time might and would have been very strong 
and defensible, and an asylum in the greatest danger, 
must be in a manner totally abandoned. As the case 
now stands, we have no place tenable, no place of 
safety ; all is exposed and open to attacks ; and by not 
having a garrison kept at this place, no convoys can get 
up to us at Fort Cumberland, and the communication 
with the inhabitants is entirely cut off, so that soldiers 
and inhabitants cannot assist each other. 

In regard to my residing at Fort Cumberland, I shall 
lay before you such inconveniences as must unavoid- 
ably arise, while we pursue these defensive measures ; 
in doing which, I think I only do my duty. First, as 
Fort Cumberland lies more advanced, and wide of all 
other forts, I shall be prevented from having the imme- 
diate direction of any but that. Secondly, the stores 
being at this place, and I at that, it will be impossible to 
deliver them regularly. I must either trust to a subal- 
tern officer to order them discretionally, or else an 
express must be first sent to me, and then I must send 
to the storekeeper to deliver the necessaries wanted for 
each garrison. Moreover, there is no travelling to Fort 
Cumberland without endangering life, except with a 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 207 

pretty strong escort. Thirdly, by being at Fort Cum- 
berland a total stagnation of business must ensue, be- 
cause money is lodged with me for discharging all 
contingent expenses arising in the service, and no per- 
sons will, or can, come to me there. Consequently 
they will be slack in furnishing us with wagons and 
necessaries of every kind, which now by due payment 
may be had at call. Lastly, Winchester is in the cen- 
tre, as it were, of all the forts, and is convenient for 
receiving intelligence and distributing orders. It also 
lies in a vale of land, that has suffered more than any 
other from the incursions of the enemy. 

I hope, after receiving a peremptory order, the men- 
tioning of these things will not appear presuming or 
odd. I do not hesitate a moment to obey. On the 
contrary, I shall comply as soon as I can. I mean 
nothing more than to point out the consequences, that 
must necessarily attend this step, as I apprehend you 
were not thoroughly apprised of our situation. Some, 
Sir, who are inclined to put an unfavorable construction 
on this ingenuous recital, may say, that I am loath to 
leave Winchester. I declare, upon my honor, I am not, 
but had rather a thousand times be at Fort Cumberland, 
if I could do the duty there. I am tired of this place, 
the inhabitants, and the life I lead here ; and if, after 
what I have said, you should think it necessary for me 
to reside at that fort, I shall acquiesce with pleasure and 
cheerfulness, and be freed from much anxiety, plague, 
and business. To be at Fort Cumberland sometimes, I 
think highly expedient, and have hitherto done it. 
Three weeks ago I came from that place. 

I have used every endeavour to detain drafts, but all 
in vain. They are home-sick and tired of work. They 
all declare, that, if an expedition is conducted in the 
spring, they will serve two, three, or four months ; but 



208 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. ^ET. 24. 



these are words of course. The Catawbas are out on 
the scout with an officer and some men of ours. They 
proposed, when I was at Fort Cumberland, to stay only 
one moon, and then to set out for their nation, with a 
report of the country and its convenience to the enemy, 
(but rather with a report of our usage, I believe.) It 
therefore behoves us to reward them well, and keep 
them in temper. They applied to me for several neces- 
saries, such as a suit of clothes for each, wampum, pipes, 
tomahawks, and silver trinkets for the wrists and arms. 
The wampum and tomahawks I have purchased. The 
want of the other articles may occasion somte murmur- 
ing, and there are very few things suitable at Fort Cum- 
berland. They seemed desirous, that an officer should 
return with them, and gave strong assurances of his 
bringing in a number. If you approve it, I shall en- 
deavour to fix upon some officer, that falls most within 
their customs, and send him upon this duty. The In- 
dians expect to be sent back upon horses. Do you 
approve that they should 1 I will not take upon me to 
buy horses without your orders. The Cherokees are 
not yet arrived, nor the arms from Augusta.

TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM BRONAUGH, ON THE 
SOUTH BRANCH. 



Fort Loudoun, 17 December, 1756. 

SIR, 

You are strictly required, immediately upon receipt 
of this, to transmit your provisions and stores to Cap- 
tain Waggener's Fort, and there leave them. Then 
march your company to Pearsall's, in order to escort a 




PART!. THE FRENCH WAR. 209 

quantity of flour to Fort Cumberland, where you and 
your whole company are to remain. 

I expect you will pay due regard to this order, and 
put it in execution with the utmost alacrity, as it is in 
consequence of express directions from the Governor 
and Council. I heartily commiserate the poor, unhappy 
inhabitants, left by this means exposed to every incur- 
sion of a merciless enemy, and I wish it were in my 
power to offer them better support, than good wishes 
will afford. You may assure the settlement, that this 
unexpected, and, if I may be allowed to say it, unavoid- 
able step was taken without my concurrence or knowl- 
edge ; that it is an express order from the Governor, 
and can neither be evaded nor delayed. Therefore, 
any representations to me of their danger, and the ne- 
cessity of continuing troops among them, will be fruit- 
less ; for, as I before observed, I have inclination, but 
no power left, to serve them. It is also the Governor's 
order, that the forts be left standing for the inhabitants 
to possess if they think proper. * 

I am, Sir, yours, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DEVWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 19 December, 1756. 

SIR, 

Your letter of the 10th came to hand the 15th; in 
consequence of which I despatched orders immediately 
to all the garrisons on the Branch to evacuate their forts, 
repair to Pearsall's, where they would meet the flour 
from this place, and escort it to Fort Cumberland. I

several other forts.

210 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [M-r. 24. 

fear the provisions purchased for the support of these 
forts, and now lying in bulk, will be wasted and de- 
stroyed, notwithstanding I have given directions to the 
assistant commissary on the Branch, and to Waggener's 
company, to use their utmost diligence in collecting the 
whole, and securing them where his company is posted. 
An escort, with all the flour we have been able to pro- 
cure (amounting to an insufficient quantity for want of 
water), will set out from this place on Tuesday next. 
I expect to depart sooner myself, leaving directions with 
Captain Mercer, whom I have appointed to command 
here, and I shall repair as expeditiously as possible to 
Fort Cumberland. 

I am a little at a loss to understand the meaning of 
your orders, and the opinion of the Council, when I am 
directed to evacuate all the stockade forts, and at the 
same time to march only one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland, and to continue the like number here to 
garrison Fort Loudoun. If the stockade forts are all 
abandoned, there will be more men than are required 
for these two purposes, and the communication between 
them, of near eighty miles, will be left without a settler, 
unguarded and exposed. But I mean nothing more by 
this intimation, than to ascertain your intentions, to which 
I would willingly pay strict obedience. * 



* It is no wonder, that Colonel Washington should complain, as he often 
did, of the confusion and inconsistency of his orders. In the present case, 
the Governor first ordered him to march from Fort Loudoun to Fort Cum- 
berland more men than he had under his command at the former post, and 
still to leave a number sufficient to keep up the garrison, and continue the 
works. When this order was countermanded as absurd and impracticable, 
another was issued for calling in all the men at the stockade forts, sending 
one hundred to Fort Cumberland, and retaining the same number at Fort 
Loudoun, by which means the smaller forts, essential for the defence of 
the people, would be evacuated, and a large number of men left unem- 
ployed. A third order was necessary to remedy the blunders of the other 
two, by entrusting the matter to the discretion of the Commander-in-chief. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 211 

A return of the stores at this place is enclosed. I 
should have sent it before, but waited to add a return of 
those at Fort Cumberland. None has yet come down. 

If Captain M c Neil goes to the Cherokee nation, it 
vvould be well for him to conduct the Catawbas home. 
But when I recommended an officer's going with them, 
it was with a view of engaging a body of their men to 
come to our assistance in the spring, and to march with 
their warriors, not choosing to trust altogether to their 
unmeaning promises and capricious humors. But you 
will be pleased to direct as you see proper in this affair. 
I have hitherto advanced very little money to the mas- 
ters of servants, because I waited your directions. I 
received forty-one last night from Captain M c Neil, who 
desires leave to continue recruiting. I do not consent 
to it, until I know whether it is agreeable to you, and 
whether I may send out as many other officers as can 
be spared for the same service. 

I should have been exceedingly glad, if your Honor 
and the Council had directed in what manner Fort 
Cumberland is to be strengthened ; that is, whether it 
is to be made cannon-proof or not ; and that you would 
fix the sum beyond which we shall not go, for I must 
look to you for the expense. I have read that para- 
graph in Lord Loudoun's letter, which you were pleased 
to send me, over and over again, but am unable to com- 
prehend its meaning. * What scheme it was, that I was 

The Governor's settled determination to sustain Fort Cumberland, con- 
trary to the opinion of Colonel Washington, betrayed him and his Council 
into a series of hasty resolutions and wild mistakes. 

* In this paragraph Lord Loudoun writes to the Governor; "As to 
the affair of Fort Cumberland, I own it gives me great uneasiness, and I 
am of the same opinion with you, that it was very material to have sup- 
ported that fort this winter, and after that we could easily have made it a 
better post than ever it has been, from what I hear of it. I cannot agree 
with Colonel Washington in not drawing in the posts from the stockade 
forts in order to defend that advanced one ; and I should imagine much 



212 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JGx. 24. 

carrying into execution without waiting advice, I am at 
a loss to know, unless it was building the chain of forts 
along our frontiers, which I not only undertook con- 
formably to an act of Assembly, and by your ow 
orders, but, with respect to the places, in pursuance of a 
council of war. If, under these circumstances, my 
conduct is responsible for the fate of Fort Cumber- 
land, it must be confessed, that I stand upon a totter- 
ing foundation indeed. I cannot charge my memory 
with either proposing, or intending, to draw the forts 
nearer Winchester. The garrison of Fort Cumberland, 
it is true, I did wish to have removed to Cox's, which is 
nearer Winchester by twenty-five miles ; but not farther 
from the enemy, if a road were opened from thence to 
the Little Meadows, which place is about twenty miles 
distant, and the same from Fort Cumberland, and more 
in the warriors' path. However, I see with much regret, 
that Lord Loudoun seems to have prejudged my pro- 



more of the frontier will be exposed by retiring your advanced posts near 
Winchester, where I understand he is retired, for, from your letter, I take 
it for granted he has before this executed his plan, without waiting for any 
advice. If he leaves any of the great quantity of stores behind, it will be 
very unfortunate, and he ought to consider that it must lie at his own door. 
This proceeding, I am afraid, will have a bad effect, as to the Dominion 
[Virginia], and will not have a good appearance at home." 

From this extract it is manifest, that Lord Loudoun (who was then in 
New, York, and had never visited Virginia,) had no accurate knowledge of 
the transactions in question, and that he had been misled by the Gover- 
nor's letters. His remarks, as applied to the acts and designs of Colonel 
Washington, are literally without meaning. It is extraordinary, that the 
Governor should send them to him, knowing as he did their inaccuracy, 
and foreseeing as he must, that Colonel Washington would discover on 
the face of them an unfair attempt, in some quarter, to prejudice him in 
the mind of Lord Loudoun. The Governor afterwards thought to add a 
palliative, by assuring him, that the " paragraph of Lord Loudoun's letter 
was entirely confined to Fort Cumberland ; he was afraid you would have 
evacuated and dismantled that fort before his letter reached me ; nor can 
you think, that he either prejudges or has any bad opinion of your con- 
duct." This is an evasive reply, unsatisfactory, and suspicious. 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 213 



ceedings, without being thoroughly informed of the 
springs and motives, that actuated my conduct. How 
far I have mistaken the means to recommend my ser- 
vices, I know not, but I am certain of this, that no man 
ever intended better, or studied the interest of his coun- 
try with more zeal, than I have done ; and nothing gives 
me greater uneasiness and concern, than that his Lord- 
ship should have imbibed prejudices so unfavorable to 
my character, as to excite his belief that I was capable 
of doing any thing, " that will have a bad effect as to 
the Dominion, and no good appearance at home." 

As I had your permission to go down when his Lord- 
ship shall favor us with a visit, I desired Colonel Carlyle 
to inform me when he should pass through Alexandria, 
and I will set out accordingly. I hope nothing has in- 
tervened to alter this indulgence. It is a favor I should 
not have thought of asking, had I believed the service 
would suffer in my absence, but I am convinced it will 
not. And I cannot help saying, I believe we are the 
only troops on this continent, that are kept summer and 
winter to the severest duty, without the least respite or 
indulgence. 

The delay of the soldiers' clothes occasions unac 
countable murmurs and complaints, and I am very much 
afraid we shall have few men left, if they arrive not in 
a week or two. You would be astonished to see the 
naked condition of the poor wretches. How they pos- 
sibly can subsist, much less work, in such severe 
weather, is not easy to conceive. Had we but blankets 
to give them, or any thing to defend them from the cold, 
they might perhaps be easy. 

I have formerly hinted to you our necessity for a 
speedy supply of cash, and have advised with the 
Speaker likewise, that he may not be unprepared. I 
purpose to send down by the 10th of next month.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES. 

Winchester, 19 December, 1756. 

SIR, 

You are no stranger, I presume, to the late resolutions 
of the Governor and Council, the consequence of which 
I meditate with great concern. We are ordered to re- 
inforce Fort Cumberland with one hundred men, and, to 
enable me to carry that number thither, all the stockade 
forts on the Branch are to be evacuated, and in course 
all the settlements abandoned, except what lie under the 
immediate protection of Captain Waggener's fort, the 
only place exempted in their resolve. Surely his Honor 
and the Council are not fully acquainted with the situa- 
tion and circumstances of the unhappy frontiers, thus to 
expose so valuable a tract as the Branch, in order to 
support a fortification, in itself of very little importance 
to the inhabitants or the colony. The former order of 
Council would have endangered not only the loss of Fort 
Loudoun, the stores, and Winchester, but a general re- 
moval of the settlers of this vale, even to the Blue Ridge. 
This last has the same object in view, namely, Fort Cum- 
berland, and, to maintain it, the best lands in Virginia are 
laid open to the mercy of a cruel and inhuman enemy. 

These people have long struggled with the dangers 
of savage incursions, daily soliciting defence, and willing 
to keep their ground. To encourage them, all my little 
help has been administered, and they seemed satisfied 
with my intentions, resolving to continue while any 




PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 215 

probability of support remained. The disposition I had 
made of our small regiment gave general satisfaction to 
the settlements, and content began to appear every- 
where. The necessary measures for provisions and 
stores were satisfactorily concerted, and every regulation 
established for the season. But the late order reverses, 
confuses, and incommodes every thing ; to say nothing 
of the extraordinary expense of carriage, disappoint- 
ments, losses, and alterations, which must fall heavy on 
the country. Whence it arises, or why, I am truly ig- 
norant; but my strongest representations of matters 
relative to the peace of the frontiers are disregarded, as 
idle and frivolous; my propositions and measures, as 
partial and selfish ; and all my sheerest endeavours for 
the service of my country are perverted to the worst 
purposes. My orders are dark, doubtful, and uncertain ; 
to-day approved, to-morrow condemned. Left to act 
and proceed at hazard, accountable for the conse- 
quences, and blamed without the benefit of defence, 
if you can think my situation capable of exciting the 
smallest degree of envy, or affording the least satisfac- 
tion, the truth is yet hidden from you, and you entertain 
notions very different from the reality of the case. 
However, I am determined to bear up under all these 
embarrassments some time longer, in hope of a better 
regulation on the arrival of Lord Loudoun, to whom I 
look for the future fate of Virginia. 

His Lordship, I think, has received impressions tend- 
ing to my prejudice, by false representations of facts, if 
I may judge from a paragraph of one of his letters to 
the Governor, on which is founded the resolve to sup- 
port Fort Cumberland at all events. The severity of 
the season, and nakedness of the soldiers, are matters 
of much compassion, and give rise to infinite complaints. 
Nor is it possible to obviate them, unless the clothing 



216 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T. 24. 

come in immediately. You would be surprised how 
the poor creatures live, much more how they can do 
duty. Had we but blankets, they might be appeased 
for a little time. As we have not, I fear many will 
desert. 

I advised you formerly of our necessity for cash, and 
I now earnestly request it soon. I think of sending down 
by the 10th of next month, or sooner if agreeable. 
Please to inform me upon what I may depend, as our 
men are impatient, and with some reason, when without 
both money and clothes. I need not urge the advan- 
tage of small bills. We shall have occasion for at least 
six thousand pounds to clear us to the 1st of January. 
The commissary wants above half that sum to furnish 
his stock of provisions. The remainder will be ex- 
hausted in paying the troops. We ought always to 
have money in hand, as we are often reduced to many 
inconveniences by waiting for it, not to mention the ex- 
pense and trouble. * 

I am, dear Sir, your most obliged and affectionate 
humble servant. 



* In reply to this letter Mr. Speaker Robinson wrote ; 
" I am truly concerned at the uneasiness you are under in your present 
situation, and the more so, as I am sensible you have too much reason for 
it. The resolution of defending Fort Cumberland, and evacuating the 
other forts, was taken before I knew or mistrusted any thing of the matter. 
I must confess I was not a little surprised at it, and took the liberty to ex- 
postulate with many of the Council upon it, who gave me in answer, that 
Lord Loudoun had insisted that Fort Cumberland should be preserved, 
and, as we had so few troops, it could not be done without breaking up the 
small forts, and taking the men from them. 

" It was to no purpose to tell them, that our frontiers would thereby be 
entirely exposed to our cruel and savage enemy, and that they could re- 
ceive no protection from Fort Cumberland, as it was in another province, 
and so remote from any of our inhabitants ; and further, that the act of 
Assembly, which gave the money solely for the defence and protection of 
our frontiers, would be violated, and the money applied otherwise than the 
Assembly intended. Yet, notwithstanding all I could say they persisted

TO THE EARL OF LOUDOUN. 

Fort Loudoun, February, 1757. 

MY LORD, 

The posture of affairs in this quarter is really melan- 
choly, and the prospect was rendered more gloomy 
while there appeared no hopes of amendment; but, 
from the presence of your Lordship at this time in the 
Dominion, we conceive hopes of seeing these threaten 
ing clouds dispelled. 

The sums of money, which have been granted by this 
colony to carry on the war, have been very consider- 
able ; and to reflect to what little purpose is matter of 
great concern, and will seem surprising to those, who 
are not acquainted with the causes, and the confusion 
with which all our affairs have hitherto been conducted, 
owing to our having no fixed object, nor pursuing any 
regular system, or plan of operation. 

As I have studied with attention and care the nature 
of the service, have been myself engaged in it from the 
beginning of the present broils, and an eyewitness to all 
the movements and various proceedings, I beg leave to 
offer a concise and candid account of our circumstances 



in their resolution, without alleging any other reason, than that it was in 
pursuance of Lord Loudoun's desire. 

" It cannot be a difficult matter to guess, who was the author and pro- 
moter of this advice and resolution, or by whom Lord Loudoun has been 
persuaded, that the place is of such importance. But supposing it were 
really so, it ought to be defended by the people in whose province it is 
[Maryland], or at least at the expense of the three colonies jointly, and 
our own frontiers not left exposed for the defence of a place, from which 
we cannot receive the least advantage or protection. The present un- 
happy state of our country must fill the mind of every well-wisher to it 
with dismal and gloomy apprehensions ; and without some speedy altera- 
tions in our counsels, which may God send, the fate of it must soon be 
determined."

to your Lordship ; from which many errors may be dis- 
covered, that merit redress in a very high degree. 

It was not ascertained until too late, that the French 
were on the Ohio; or rather, that we could be per- 
suaded they came there with a design to invade his 
Majesty's dominions. Nay, after I was sent out in De- 
cember, 1753, and brought undoubted testimony even 
from themselves of their avowed design, it was yet 
thought a fiction, and a scheme to promote the interest 
of a private company, even by some who had a share in 
the government. These unfavorable surmises caused 
great delays in raising the first men and money, and 
gave the active enemy time to take possession of the 
Fork of the Ohio (which they now call Duquesne), be- 
fore we were in sufficient strength to advance thither, 
which has been the chief source of all our past and 
present misfortunes. For by this means, as the French 
got between us and our Indian allies, they fixed those 
in their interests, who were wavering, and obliged the 
others to neutrality, till the unhappy defeat of General 
Braddock. 

The troops under Colonel Dunbar going into quarters 
in July, the inactivity of the neighbouring colonies, and 
the incapacity of this, conspired to give the French 
great room to exult, and the Indians little reason to ex- 
pect a vigorous offensive war on our side, and induced 
the defensive plan, which promised the greatest show 
of protection. This is an undeniable fact, as well as that 
all the Indians did not forsake the English interests, till 
three months after the battle of Monongahela, but actu- 
ally waited to see what measures would be concerted 
to regain our losses, and afford them the protection we 
had but too liberally promised. 

Virginia, it is true, was not inactive all this time. On 
the contrary, she voted a handsome supply for raising 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 219 

men to carry on the war, or, more properly, to defend 
herself; matters being reduced to this extremity for 
want of assistance. But even in this she signally failed, 
and, as I apprehend, from the following causes. 

The men first levied to repel the enemy marched for 
the Ohio in the beginning of April, 1754, without tents, 
without clothes, in short, without any conveniences to 
shelter them, in that remarkably cold and wet season, 
from the inclemency of the weather, or to make the 
service tolerably agreeable. In this state did they con- 
tinue, notwithstanding, till the battle of the Meadows, in 
July following, never receiving in all that space any sub- 
sistence ; and they were very often under the greatest 
straits and difficulties for want of provisions. 

These things were productive of great murnrurings 
and discontent, and rendered the service so distasteful 
to the men, that, not being paid immediately upon com- 
ing in, they thought themselves bubbled, and that no 
reward for their services was ever intended. This 
caused desertion ; and the deserters, spreading over the 
country, recounting their sufferings and want of pay, 
which rags and poverty sufficiently testified, fixed in 
the mind of the populace such horrid impressions of the 
hardships they had encountered, that no arguments 
could remove these prejudices, or facilitate the recruit- 
ing service. 

This put the Assembly upon enacting a law to im- 
press vagrants, which added to our difficulties, for, as 
these abandoned miscreants were compelled into the 
service, they embraced every opportunity to effect their 
escape, gave a loose to their vicious principles, and in- 
vented the most unheard-of stories to palliate desertion 
and gain compassion ; in which they not only succeeded, 
but obtained protection likewise. So that it was next 
to impossible, after this, to apprehend deserters, while 



220 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. |>Ex. 24. 

the civil officers rather connived at their escape, than 
aided in securing them. 

Thus were affairs situated, when we were ordered, 
in September, 1755, to recruit our force to twelve hun- 
dred men. It is easy to conceive, under "these circum- 
stances, why we did not fulfil the order, especially when 
the officers had not a sufficient allowance for this ardu- 
ous task. We continued, however, using our endeavours 
until March following, without much success. 

The Assembly, meeting about that time, came to a 
resolution of augmenting our numbers to fifteen hundred 
men, by drafting the militia, who were to continue in 
the service until December only. By reason of a clause 
in the act exempting all those, who should pay ten 
pounds, our numbers were very little increased, one 
part of the people paying that sum, and many of the 
poorer sort absconding. This was not the only per- 
nicious clause, for the funds arising from these forfeitures 
were thrown into the treasury ; whereas, had they been 
deposited in proper hands for recruiting, the money 
might have turned to good account. But a greater 
grievance still was the restraining of the forces from 
marching out of the colony, or acting offensively, and 
ordering them to build forts, and garrison them, along a 
frontier of more than three hundred miles in extent. 
How far they, or any like number, are equal to such a 
task, and how repugnant a defensive plan is to the true 
interest and welfare of the colony, I submit to any one 
to determine who will consider the following particulars. 

First, that erecting forts at greater distances than fif- 
teen or eighteen miles, or a day's march asunder, and 
garrisoning them with less than eighty or a hundred 
men each, is not answering the intention ; because, if 
they are at a greater distance from each other, it is in- 
convenient for the soldiers to scout between them, and

it gives the enemy full scope to make incursions without 
being discovered, until they have fallen on the inhabit- 
ants and committed ravages. And, after they are dis- 
covered, the time required, in assembling troops from 
forts more distant, prevents a pursuit being made in 
time, and allows the enemy to escape without danger 
into a country so mountainous and full of swamps and 
hollow ways covered with woods. Then, if garrisoned 
with less than eighty or a hundred men, the number is 
too small to afford detachments, that are not very liable 
to be cut off by the enemy, whose numbers in this close 
country can scarcely be known till they are proved. In- 
dian parties are generally intermixed with some French, 
and are so dexterous at skulking, that their spies, lying 
about these small forts for some days and taking a pris- 
oner, make certain discoveries of the strength of the gar- 
rison ; and then, upon observing a scouting party coming 
out, they will first cut it off, and afterwards attempt the 
fort. Instances of this have lately happened. 

Secondly, our frontiers are of such extent, that if the 
enemy were to make a formidable attack on one side, 
before the troops on the other could give assistance, 
they might overrun the country ; and it is not improba- 
ble, if they had a design on one part, that they would 
make a feint on the other. 

Thirdly, the cost to the country in building these 
forts, and removing stores and provisions into them. 

Fourthly, where and when will this expense end? 
We may be assured, if we do not endeavour to remove 
the cause, w r e shall be as liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now ; indeed more so. Because, 
if the French are allowed to possess those lands in 
peace, they will have the entire command of the Indians, 
and grow stronger in their alliance ; while we, by our 
defensive schemes and pusillanimous behaviour, shall

52 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 24, 

exhaust our treasury, reduce our strength, and become 
the contempt of these savage nations, who are every day 
enriching themselves with the plunder and spoils of our 
people. 

It will evidently appear from the whole tenor of nr 
conduct, but more especially from reiterated represen- 
tations, how strongly I have urged the Governor and 
Assembly to pursue different measures, and tried to 
convince them, by all the reasonings I could offer, of the 
impossibility of covering so extensive a frontier from In- 
dian incursions, without more force than Virginia can 
maintain. I have endeavoured to demonstrate, that it 
would require fewer men to remove the cause, than to 
prevent the effects, while the cause subsists. This, 
notwithstanding, as I before observed, was the measure 
adopted, and the plan under which we have acted for 
eight months past, with the disagreeable reflection of 
doing no essential service to our country, nor gaining 
honor to ourselves, or reputation to our regiment. How- 
ever, under these disadvantageous restraints I must beg 
leave to say, that the regiment has not been inactive ; 
on the contrary, it has performed a vast deal of work, 
and has been very alert in defending the people. This 
will appear from the fact, that, notwithstanding we are 
more contiguous to the French and their Indian allies, 
and more exposed to their frequent incursions, than any 
of the neighbouring colonies, yet we have not lost half 
the number of inhabitants, that others have done, but 
considerably more soldiers in their defence. In the 
course of this campaign (since March, I mean, as we 
have had but one constant campaign, and one continued 
scene of action, from the time we first entered the ser- 
vice), our troops have been engaged in upwards of 
twenty skirmishes, and we have had near a hundred 
men killed and wounded. From a small regiment dis-

persed over the country, and acting upon the defensive, 
as ours does by order, this, I conceive, will not appear 
inconsiderable to those, who are in the least degree ac- 
quainted with the nature of this service, and the posture 
of our affairs ; however it may seem to chimney-corner 
politicians, thirsting for news, and expecting by every 
express to hear in what manner Fort Duquesne is taken, 
and the garrison led away captive by our small num- 
bers ; although we are restrained from making the at- 
tempt, were our hopes of success ever so rational. 

The next points, which I shall beg leave to mention, 
are our military laws and regulations. 

The first men raised, if I rightly remember, were un- 
der no law ; if any, the militia law, which was next of 
kin to none. Under this we remained a short time, 
and, by instilling the idea into the soldiers, who knew 
no better, that they were governed by the articles of 
war, we felt little inconvenience. The next campaign 
we were joined by the regulars, and made subject to 
their laws. After the regulars left us, the Assembly, as 
I before mentioned, passed an act in September follow- 
ing to raise twelve hundred men, and, in order I sup- 
pose to improve upon the act of Parliament, prepared a 
military code of their own, but such a one as could pre- 
serve no military discipline while it existed. This being 
represented by the most pressing and repeated remon- 
strances, the Assembly were induced to pass a bill in 
October following, for one year only, fixing the penalty 
of death for mutiny and desertion. But they took no 
cognizance of many other crimes, equally punishable 
by act of Parliament. So that no officer, or soldier, 
accused of cowardice, holding correspondence with the 
enemy, quitting a post, or sleeping upon it, and many 
other crimes of a capital dye, or pernicious tendency, 
could be legally tried. Neither was there any pro- 



224 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. |>ET.24. 

vision made for quartering or billeting soldiers, impress- 
ing wagons, and the like. 

But that which contributed the most towards render- 
ing this law inconvenient and absurd, and at the same 
time to demonstrate that the Assembly fully intended to 
prevent any enterprise of their troops out of the colony, 
was a clause forbidding any courts -martial to sit out of 
it ; by which means all proceedings held at Fort Cum- 
berland (in Maryland) were illegal, and we were obliged 
to remove to Virginia for the trial of offenders, or act 
contrary to law, and be open to prosecution.* How 
then were we to behave upon a march of perhaps fifty, 
eighty, or a hundred miles beyond? These circum- 
stances concurring to render the law ineffectual, in- 
duced me again to recommend an amendment, which 
I did with all the force and energy of argument I was 
master of. But no regard has hitherto been paid to my 
remonstrances. To what cause it is owing, I know not, 
unless to short sittings and hurry of business ; for I can 
conceive of no reason, why the Assembly should be 

* On the 12th of January Colonel Washington wrote to the Governor 
respecting the trial of several subaltern officers and soldiers for a mutiny. 
" I thought it needless," said he, " to send you the proceedings of the 
court-martial, or to ask warrants for execution, as we have no law to inflict 
punishment, even of the smallest kind. I shall keep those criminals in 
irons, and, if possible, under apprehensions of death, until some favorable 
opportunity may countenance a reprieve." The Governor replied, that, as 
the men were enlisted and paid with money raised for the King's service, 
he conceived they were subject to the articles of war, in the same manner 
as the King's regular forces. But so tenacious was Colonel Washington in 
upholding the rights of the Assembly and the laws of the colony, that he did 
not accede to this opinion. He considered the Assembly as the only proper 
authority to prescribe rules of discipline for an army, raised and main- 
tained at their expense ; and he believed himself amenable to the civil laws 
for any acts of severity not countenanced by that code. This was con- 
formable to the scrupulous exactness with which, during all his future mili- 
tary career, and frequently when the interest of the public service offered 
the strongest temptations to the contrary, he yielded implicit obedience to 
the civil power. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 225 

against instituting rules for the regulation of their forces, 
of which long experience in established armies has fully 
evinced the necessity. But, to cut short the account, 
we are under no government at all, properly speaking. 
Indeed, there is a jumble of laws that have little mean- 
ing or design in them, but to make the command intri- 
cate, and to prevent offence to the civil powers, who 
are tenacious of liberty, and prone to censure and con- 
demn all proceedings not strictly according to the law, 
not considering what cases may arise to render them 
necessary. 

Another grievance, to which this act subjects us, is 
the method prescribed to pay for deserters. Many 
of our deserters are apprehended in Maryland and 
Pennsylvania, and, for the sake of the reward, are 
brought to the regiment. But, instead of the reward, 
the persons thus bringing them in receive a certificate 
only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds of 
tobacco. This certificate is to be presented to a Court 
of Claims, and they refer it to the Assembly. There it 
may perhaps remain two or three years before it is paid. 
This causes great dissatisfaction, and induces the ill- 
disposed to aid, rather than prevent, the escape of 
soldiers. 

No regular provision is established for the maimed 
and wounded, which is discouraging, and grievously 
complained of. The soldiers justly observe, that the 
result of bravery is often a broken leg, arm, or incurable 
wound ; and when they are disabled, and no longer fit 
for service, they are discharged, and reduced to the ne- 
cessity of begging from door to door, or of perishing 
through indigence. It is true, no instance of this kind 
has yet appeared. On the contrary, the Assembly have 
dealt generously by those unfortunate soldiers, who have 
met with this fate. But then, this provision is not yet 

VOL. ii. 29 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 

established, nor in any manner compulsory, and a man 
may suffer in the interval of their sitting. 

After giving this short and true account of our mili- 
tary laws, and observing that even these, laws are now 
expired, I conceive there need but few -arguments to 
prove the difficulty of keeping soldiers under proper 
discipline, who know they are not punishable by law for 
the most atrocious crimes. How then is it to be won- 
dered at, if mutiny, desertion, and all other irregularities 
should creep into a camp, or garrison, more, especially 
if we consider that hard duty, and want of clothes and 
of almost every necessary that renders a soldier's life 
comfortable and easy, are strong incentives, and, to 
go further, when these intolerable grievances are set to 
view in the most glaring point of light by a person, who, 
lost to all sense of honor and virtue, and building, I am 
sorry to say, upon a proclamation inviting the deserters 
from the Virginia Regiment to enlist into the Royal 
American Regiment, has made use of every artifice to 
represent the fatigues and hardships of our service, and 
the ease and conveniences of the other, to seduce them 
from their duty ? 

Want of clothing may be esteemed another principal 
grievance, which our soldiers have labored under. In 
the first twelve months of their service they received no 
clothing; but in March, 1754, they were presented each 
with a suit made of thin, sleazy cloth without lining, and 
flannel waistcoats of an inferior sort. After that no 
others were sent for (although two pence stoppage was 
drawn from every man's pay, recruits npt excepted,) 
until repeated complaints and remonstrances from me, 
enforced in June last by a representation of many gen- 
tlemen of the Assembly, who had formed an association, 
and saw the disagreeable situation of the soldiers, in- 
duced the Committee, to whom those addresses were 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 227 

presented, to send for clothing. The clothes were to 
have been here by the middle of October, but no advice 
is received of them yet, which gives the soldiers some 
pretence to suspect they are deceived. It is to this ir- 
regular pay, and the causes aforementioned, that their 
late disobedience ought to be ascribed. For I can truly 
say, and confidently assert, that no soldiers ever were 
under better command than these were before. 

Perhaps it may be asked, by gentlemen not thoroughly 
acquainted with the nature of our service, why the offi- 
cers do not see that their men's pay is more properly 
applied ? In answer I must beg leave to observe, that, 
after the soldiers have appropriated a part for purchas- 
ing reasonable and tit necessaries, the remainder is 
barely sufficient to keep them in shoes, owing, in the 
first place, to the very great consumption the service oc- 
casions, and, in the next, to the exorbitant price, which 
this article bears. I have known a soldier go upon 
command with a new pair of shoes, which perhaps have 
cost him from seven shillings and sixpence to ten shil- 
lings, and return without any ; so much do they wear in 
wading creeks, fording rivers, and clambering mountains 
covered with rocks. 

As great a grievance as any I have mentioned is yet 
unnoticed, and that is the present regulation of the mi- 
litia ; but a representation of this matter will come better 
and more properly from others. 

To point out all the causes, which combine to make 
our service infinitely hard and disagreeable, would swell 
these observations into a volume, and require time, and 
a more able pen than mine. But there are yet some 
things, that should be mentioned. 

An ill-judged economy is shown in raising men. We 
are either insensible of danger, till it breaks upon our 
heads, or else, through mistaken 'notions of economy, 



228 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. ^T. 24. 



evade the expense, till the blow is struck, and then run 
into an extreme of raising militia. These, after an age, 
as it were, is spent in assembling them, come up, make 
a noise for a time, oppress the inhabitants, and then re- 
turn, leaving the frontiers unguarded as before. And 
this plan is pursued, notwithstanding former experience 
convinces us, if reason did not, that the French and In- 
dians are watching their opportunity, when we are lulled 
into fatal security, unprepared for resisting an attack, to 
muster their forces to invade the country. By ravaging 
one part they terrify another, and retreat when our mi- 
litia assemble, but repeat the stroke as soon as they are 
dispersed, sending down parties in the interim to dis- 
cover our motions, procure intelligence, and sometimes 
to divert our troops. Such an invasion we may expect 
in March, if measures to prevent it are neglected, as 
they hitherto have been. 

The want of tools occasions insurmountable difficulties 
in carrying on our works, either offensive or defensive. 
Cartridge-paper is an article not to be met with in 
Virginia. 

And now, before I conclude, I must beg leave to add, 
that my unwearied endeavours are inadequately re- 
warded. The orders I receive are full of ambiguity. I 
am left, like a wanderer in the wilderness, to proceed 
at hazard. I am answerable for consequences, and 
blamed, without the privilege of defence. This, my 
Lord, I beg leave to declare, is at present my situation. 
Therefore, it is not to be wondered at, if, under such 
peculiar circumstances, I should be sick of a service, 
which promises so little of a soldier's reward. I have 
long been satisfied of the impossibility of continuing 
in this service, without loss of honor. Indeed, I was 
fully convinced of it before I accepted the command the 
second time, seeing the cloudy prospect before me ; and 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 229 

I did for this reason reject the offer, until I was ashamed 
any longer to refuse, not caring to expose my character 
to public censure. The solicitations of the country 
overcame my objections, and induced me to accept it. 

Another reason has of late operated to continue me 
in the service until now, and that is, the dawn of hope 
that arose, when I heard your Lordship was destined 
by his Majesty for the important command of his armies 
in America, and appointed to the government of his do- 
minion of Virginia. Hence it was, that I drew my 
hopes, and fondly pronounced your Lordship our pa- 
tron. Although I had not the honor to be known to 
your Lordship, yet your name was familiar to my ear, 
on account of the important services rendered to his 
Majesty in other parts of the world. 

Ever since our defeat at the Meadows, and behaviour 
under General Braddock, we have been tantalized, nay, 
bid to expect most sanguinely a better establishment, 
and have waited in tedious expectation of seeing this 
accomplished. The Assembly, it is true, have, I be- 
lieve, done every thing in their power to bring this 
about; first, by soliciting his Honor, the Lieutenant- 
Governor, to address his Majesty; and next, by ad- 
dressing his Majesty themselves in favor of their regi- 
ment. What success these addresses have met with, 
I am yet ignorant. With regard to myself, I cannot 
forbear adding, that, had General Braddock survived 
his unfortunate defeat, I should have met with prefer- 
ment agreeable to my wishes. I had his promise to 
that purpose, and I believe that gentleman was too sin- 
cere and generous to make unmeaning offers, where no 
favors were asked. General Shirley was not unkind in 
his promises, but he has gone to England. 

I do not know, my Lord, in what light this short and 
disinterested relation may be received ; but it is offered 

VOL. II. T

with the utmost candor and submission. It contains no 
misrepresentations, nor aggravated statement of facts, 
nor unjust reflections. 

Virginia is a country young in war, and, till the break- 
ing out of these disturbances, has remained in the most 
profound and tranquil peace, never studying war nor 
warfare. It is not, therefore, to be imagined, that she 
can fall into proper measures at once. All that can be 
expected at her hands she cheerfully offers, the 
sinews of war, and these only want your Lordship's 
ability and experience to be properly applied and di- 
rected. 

Finally, my Lord, how to apologize for assuming a 
freedom, which must at any rate give you trouble, I 
know not, unless an ardent zeal to serve my country, 
and a steady attachment to her interests, and to the 
honor of arms, shall plead an excuse, till I am so happy 
as to have an opportunity of testifying in person how 
much I admire your Lordship's character, and with 
what profound respect I have the honor to be, &c. * 

* The Earl of Loudoun was expected in Virginia, and Colonel Wash- 
ington had permission from the Governor to proceed at the same time to 
Williamsburg. The plan was afterwards changed, and his Lordship re- 
quested the governors of the southern colonies to meet him at Philadel- 
phia, where they assembled about the first of March. This letter was 
written previously, and forwarded to New York. Mr. Cuningham, aid- 
de-camp to Lord Loudoun, acknowledged the receipt of it on the 27th of 
February, and added, " His Lordship seems very much pleased with the ac- 
counts you have given him of the situation of affairs to the southward." 

Colonel Washington had stationed himself, according to orders, at Fort 
Cumberland. He went likewise to Philadelphia, by consent of the Gov- 
ernor, which was granted, it must be allowed, in no very gracious terms. 

"His Lordship has desired all the southern governors," his Honor 
writes, " to meet him at Philadelphia, and consult what is proper to be 
done in these parts. As this appears to be the design of this meeting, 1 
cannot conceive what service you can be of in going there, as the plan 
concerted will in course be communicated to you and the other officers. 
However, as you seem so earnest to go, I now give you leave." 

From the tone of this letter, as well as from many other indications, he

TO RICHARD WASHINGTON, MERCHANT, LONDON. 

Fort Loudoun, 15 April, 1757. 

DEAR SIR, 

After so long silence it may be expected, that I 
should introduce this letter with an apology for my 
seeming neglect. I own, Sir, it is necessary to urge 
something in my defence, and what can be so proper as 
the truth? 

I have been posted, then, for twenty months past 
upon our cold and barren frontiers, to perform, I think I 
m#y say, impossibilities ; that is, to protect from the cruel 
incursions of a crafty, savage enemy a line of inhabitants, 
of more than three hundred and fifty miles in extent, 
with a force inadequate to the task. By this means I 
am become in a manner an exile, and seldom informed 
of those opportunities, which I might otherwise embrace, 
of corresponding with my friends. 

Experience has convinced every thinking man in this 
colony, that we must bid adieu to peace and safety 
whilst' the French are allowed to possess the Ohio, and 
to practise their arts among the numerous tribes of In- 
dian nations that inhabit those regions, and that it must 
be attended with an expense infinitely greater to defend 
our possessions, as they ought to be defended against 
the skulking enemy, than to remove the cause of our 
groundless fears, by the reduction of Fort Duquesne. 

had no reason to expect a warm friend in the Governor of Virginia at the 
councils in Philadelphia. He did not fail, therefore, to embrace the oppor- 
tunity, reluctantly as it had been granted, of being present and attending 
personally to the interests of his regiment, and to affairs in which he was 
so deeply concerned. He was consulted by Lord Loudoun, in regard to 
the future disposition of the forces on the frontiers of the southern colonies. 
But after all, he was not successful in his wish to have the Virginia regi- 
ment put upon the same footing as the regular army, and to obtain King's 
commissions for himself and his officers. 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS |>ET. 25. 

Yet, from what strange causes I know not, no attempt 
this season will be made, I fear, to destroy this hold of 
the barbarians, for they deserve no better name, who 
have become a terror to three populous colonies. Vir- 
ginia may justly say, that she was always willing to fur- 
nish her full proportion of men and money for this 
desirable end; and, I think I may venture to affirm, 
that there never was, and I verily believe never will be, 
a more favorable time than the present for an enterprise 
Of this kind, while the enemy's troops are doubtless 
drawn off to the northward, to defend themselves at 
home against the more formidable attack of Lord 
Loudoun. 

I have now to add, that I am so little acquainted with 
the business relative to my private affairs, that I can 
scarce give you any information concerning it. I know 
that I ought to have some tobacco, and that it ought to 
be stripped. I have begged the favor of two persons to 
do this for me, and I desired them to write you in my 
behalf, and draw for sundry things, of which I am in 
want ; but whether any part or all of this has been done, 
I know not. I shall, therefore, desire these two things 
of you ; first, that you will put yourself to no real incon- 
venience in forwarding goods to a greater amount than 
my remittance, because I by no means intended to be 
troublesome, when I solicited your correspondence ; 
and, secondly, that whatever goods you may send 
me, where the prices are not absolutely limited, you 
will let them be fashionable, neat, and good in their sev- 
eral kinds. Enclosed is a list of sundries, which I 
should be glad to receive agreeably to these directions. 

I am, dear Sir, 
Your affectionate friend, and obedient servant.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Cumberland, 16 April, 1757. 

SIR, 

Your letter by express, of the 5th instant, I fear has 
fallen into the hands of the common enemy, for I never 
have seen it. The other of the 7th I this day received; 
1 and being exceedingly embarrassed to come at your in- 
tentions, and really at a loss to know in what manner to 
act, in such perplexed and difficult circumstances, I 
called a council of officers to my aid. The result of 
their advice you will find in the enclosed.* 

* According to the plan concerted at Philadelphia for future operations, 
Fort Cumberland was henceforward to be garrisoned by Maryland forces, 
and the Virginia troops, provisions, and stores were to be removed to Fort 
Loudoun. Hence, Colonel Washington's views, as far as Virginia was con- 
cerned, were at a late hour adopted, after a tedious winter had been spent, 
and much money had been wasted, in carrying on the works at that fort. 

In a letter, dated on the 5th of April, which had miscarried, Governor 
Dinwiddie had ordered the immediate evacuation of the place by the Vir- 
ginia troops ; and also, that two companies should be forthwith despatched 
to Fredericksburg, under Colonel Stephen, destined by direction of Lord 
Loudoun for South Carolina, where an attack from the enemy was appre- 
hended, both by sea and on the frontiers. In another letter dated on the 
7th, the Governor had reiterated his orders. In this dilemma a council 
of war was called, who decided that the fort ought not to be evacuated, till 
the Maryland forces under Captain Dagworthy should arrive. 

Fort Cumberland seemed destined to be a perpetual source of uneasi- 
ness in some quarter. When the Maryland Assembly met, Governor 
Sharpe requested means to supply provisions for that garrison. The As- 
sembly retorted with a warmth of disapprobation amounting to a repri- 
mand. " That garrison," say they, " was stationed contrary to the plain 
destination of all the forces raised and to be supported by law ; and, if any 
evil consequences have heretofore or may hereafter follow a want of sup- 
plies, let those answer for them, who have, contrary to law, been the 
means of stationing troops where they had no authority to place them." 
Votes and Proceedings for October, 1757. 

The Maryland Assembly denied the power of Lord Loudoun over the 
forces raised and paid by that colony, and his right to command them 
under any exigency without their consent. Whereupon his Lordship 
wrote a letter to Governor Sharpe, protesting against this doctrine, as

234 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^Ex. 25. 

It will not be in my power to be in Williamsburg by 
the 22 d, as your Honor desires ; but as soon after as I 
can, I certainly will. I shall leave orders with Colonel 
Stephen to march this garrison to Fort Loudoun, as 
soon as it is relieved, which cannot be before this ex- 
press may return, and then your further orders may be 
received. We have no advice of Dagworthy's inarch- 
ing, though orders were sent to him. 

I shall order all the country's stores to be carried to 
Fort Loudoun, and the two companies on Patterson's 
Creek to be posted on the Branch, to complete the 
number that was designed for that place. I have or- 
dered a particular return of the provisions to be made 
out, and Colonel Stephen to take Captain Dagworthy's 
receipt for the quantity left. 

We have been at a good deal of unavoidable expense 
and trouble to furnish the Indians with such things as 
they wanted. Some hostile Indians killed two Cataw- 
bas on Thursday last, at about one hundred and fifty 
yards from the fort, and seventy from a sentry, and 
made their escape, though pursued by other Catawbas 
and near two hundred men. And the day before yes- 
terday, two soldiers were killed and a third taken pris- 
oner, as they were coming to this place from the fort 
below. The rest of the party, being ten in number, 
with Captain Waggener among them, made their escape. 

The enclosed remonstrance I have just received, and 
think it expedient to send it to your Honor, that you 
may know the temper and disposition of the troops. 
As I expect to be with you in two or three days after 
the express, I think it needless to add any thing but an

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES. 

Fort Loudoun, 30 May, 1757.* 

DEAR SIR, 

We receive fresh proofs every day of the bad direc- 
tion of our Indian affairs. It is not easy to tell what 
expenses have arisen on account of these Indians, how 
dissatisfied they are, and how gloomy the prospect of 
pleasing them appears, while we pursue our present 
system of management. 

I therefore beg leave to propose a plan, which I know 
is exactly conformable to the French policy, and which 
may, if properly executed, be a means of retrieving our 
lost credit with these people, and prove of infinite ser- 
vice to the country. The French have a proper person 
appointed to the direction of these affairs, who makes it 
his sole business to study the dispositions of the Indians, 
and the art of pleasing them. This person is invested 
with power to treat with and reward them for every 

* Colonel Washington was now returned from Williamsburg, where ha 
had been for several days concerting with the Governor some new ar- 
rangements for the troops. The regiment was remodelled, and reduced to 
ten companies, of one hundred men each. Head-quarters were fixed at 
Fort Loudoun. 

It had been decided by the Convention at Philadelphia, that four hun- 
dred men should be sent from the Virginia regiment to the aid of South 
Carolina. Colonel Stephen sailed from Hampton with two companies, but 
no others followed. South Carolina was not attacked, and a timely rein- 
forcement from England quieted the alarms in that quarter.

piece of service, and thus, by timely presents on suitable 
occasions, to obtain very great advantages. There is 
always a store of goods committed to his care to answer 
these purposes, and no other person is suffered to med- 
dle with it ; by which means the whole business is 
thrown into one channel, and it thereby becomes easy 
and regular. Whereas, with us it is every body's busi- 
ness, and no one's, to afford supplies. Every person at- 
tempts to please, and few succeed in it, because one 
promises this, and another that, and few can perform 
any thing, but are obliged to shuffle and put the Indians 
off, to get rid of their importunities. 

Hence they accuse us of perfidy and deceit. I could 
recapitulate a great number of their reproachful com- 
plaints, if I judged it necessary to confirm what I have 
already advanced. But I believe, Sir, you are con- 
vinced from what you have seen, that there can be no 
deception in my story. Therefore, I shall remark with 
candor, freedom, and submission, that, unless some per- 
son is appointed to manage the Indian affairs of this 
colony, under the direction of the Governor, or the 
southern agent, * a vast expense and but a little advan- 
tage will accrue from the coming of the Indians among 
us. And I know of no person so well qualified for an 
undertaking of this sort as the bearer, Captain Gist. He 
has had extensive dealings with the Indians, is in great 
esteem among them, well acquainted with their manners 
and customs, indefatigable, and patient, most excel- 
lent qualities where Indians are concerned. As to his 
capacity, honesty, and zeal, I dare venture to engage. 
If he should be appointed to this duty, or, if this plan 
should take effect, I dare say you will judge it advisable

to send for a large assortment of that species of goods 
best suited for carrying on the abovementioned busi- 
ness. 

Bullen, a Catawba warrior, has been proposing a plan 
to Captain Gist for bringing in the Creek and Chicka- 
saw Indians. If such a scheme could be effected, by 
the time we shall march for Fort Duquesne, it would be 
a glorious undertaking, and worthy of the man.

TO JOHN ROBINSON. 

Fort Loudoun, 10 June, 1757. 

DEAR SIR, 

A person of a readier pen, and having more time, 
than myself, might amuse you with the vicissitudes, 
which have happened in the Indian affairs since Mr. At- 
kin came up. I acknowledge my incompetency, and 
therefore shall only observe, that the Indians have been 
pleased and displeased oftener than they ought to have 
been; and that they are gone off (that party under 
Warhatalie, I mean,) in different ways, and with far dif- 
ferent views ; one company southwardly to their nation ; 
and another northwardly to treat with the Pennsyl- 
vanians, contrary to the sentiments of Mr. Atkin, who 
has, I believe, sent to forbid any conference to be held 
with them. 

Major Lewis is returned with part of the Indians, 
that went out with him, in consequence of their having 
taken only eight days' provisions with them. He was 
unable to prevail with those savages to take more. One 
party of twenty, with ten soldiers, is gone towards Fort 
Duquesne, under Captain Spotswood ; and another 
party of fifteen, with five soldiers, under Lieutenant

Baker, who are to proceed towards Logstown. God 
send them success and a safe return. 

Unless you will interest yourself in sending money to 
discharge the public debts, I must inevitably suffer very 
considerably, as the country people all think me pledged 
to them, let what will happen. They are grown very 
clamorous, and will be more than ever incensed, if there 
should come an inadequate sum, and that sum be ap- 
propriated to the payment of the soldiers. 

I am convinced it would give pleasure to the Gover- 
nor to hear that I was involved in trouble, however 
undeservedly, such are his dispositions towards me. 

I am, 



TO COLONEL STANWIX.* 

Fort Loudoun, 15 June, 1757. 

SIR, 

A scouting party, consisting of five soldiers and fif- 
teen Cherokee Indians, who were sent out the 20th 
ultimo towards the Ohio, under Lieutenant Baker, re- 
turned the 8th instant to Fort Cumberland with five 
scalps, and a French officer, prisoner, having killed two 
other officers of the same party. Mr. Baker met with 
this party (ten French, three officers) on the head of 
Turtle Creek, twenty miles from Fort Duquesne, the 
day after they had parted with fifty Shawanese Indians 
returning from war, and would have killed and made 
prisoners of them all, had not the death of the Indian

tiers of Pennsylvania, with the command of five companies of the Royal

chief, who was killed in that skirmish, prevented their 
pursuing them. The name of the officer taken, accord- 
ing to his own account, is Velistre ; and of those killed, 
Lasosais and St. Oure ; all ensigns. 

The commandant at Duquesne and its dependencies 
is Delignery, a knight of the military order of St. Louis, 
and captain of a company of detached troops from the 
marine. This officer likewise says, that the garrison at 
Fort Duquesne consists of six hundred French and two 
hundred Indians. We sustained on our side the loss 
of the brave Swallow warrior, and one other Indian 
wounded, whom the party brought in on a bier, with no 
other sustenance for the last four days, than such as 
they derived from wild onions. 

Captain Spots wood, with ten soldiers and twenty In- 
dians, who went out at the same time, but to a different 
place, is not yet come in, nor any news of him ; which 
makes me uneasy. , 

Our Assembly have granted a further sum of eighty 
thousand pounds for the service of the ensuing year, 
and have agreed, I believe, to complete the regiment 
of this colony to twelve hundred men, besides three 
companies of rangers, of one hundred men each. Our 
strength, since the detachment embarked for Carolina, 
amounts only to four hundred and twenty rank and file ; 
and these much weakened, by the number of posts 
we hold. Governor Dinwiddie is apprehensive, that he 
shall not be able to provide arms for all these men, and 
he desired me to advise with you thereupon. 

Duty and inclination equally induce me to communi- 
cate all remarkable occurrences to you, and I shall be 
punctual in doing so. At present, however, I have only 
to add, that I am, with very great respect, your most 
obedient humble servant.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 16 June, 1757. 

SIR, 

This instant the enclosed letters came to my hands. 
I have not lost a moment's time in transmitting them to 
you, as I look upon the intelligence to be of the utmost 
importance. If the enemy are coming down in such 
numbers, and with such a train of artillery, as we are bid 
to expect, Fort Cumberland must inevitably fall into 
their hands, as no timely efforts can be made to relieve 
the garrison. I send you a copy of a council of war 
held upon this occasion. The advice I intend to pursue, 
until I receive orders. It is morally certain, that the next 
object, which the French have in view, is Fort Loudoun, 
and that is yet in a very untenable posture. They have 
no roads for carriages into any other province, except 
through this ; and there lies a quantity of stores here, be- 
longing to his Majesty and to this colony, very much 
exposed and unguarded. 

I shall not take up your time, with a tedious detail. 
You will be a sufficient judge of the present situation 
of affairs, from the circumstances already related. I 
have written to the commanding officers of Fairfax, 
Prince William, and Culpeper counties, (a copy of the 
letters I enclose,) requesting them to march part of their 
militia to this place immediately, that no time may be 
lost. You may be assured, Sir, I shall make the best 
defence I can, if attacked. I am, &,e. 

P. S. I have written to Colonel Stanwix an account 
of this affair, and enclosed him copies of the letters and 
council of war. *

TO COLONEL STANWIX. 

Tort Loudoun, 20 June, 1757. 

SIR, 

Yours of the 18th from the camp at Carlisle I re- 
ceived about noon this day, when, in company with his 
Majesty's agent for Indian affairs, I was examining the 
French prisoner brought to this place by Lieutenant 
Baker and the Cherokee Indian. A copy of this ex- 
amination I herewith enclose. You will find, Sir, from 
the tenor of his answers, that a large body of Indians 
was hourly expected at Fort Duquesne, and that, al- 
though there was not (if his intelligence is to be literally 
credited, and surely it is not) a train of artillery fit for 
such an expedition ; yet this might have been brought 
by those three hundred men, who arrived there after he 
left the place. 

It is altogether evident, if the Indian accounts may be 
relied on, that the French are bringing howitzers with 
them for the easier reduction of the place, if they should 
attack us. For, say they, your guns are but muskets, 
compared with those the French have with them. 
Theirs will admit a fawn in the muzzle, while yours will 
not take in a man's fist. To any person, in the least 
degree acquainted with the mountainous country about 
our settlements, it is clear, that the French can bring 
artillery along no other road, than that from Fort Du- 
quesne to Fort Cumberland, without spending immense 
time in mending one. I conceive that the garrison at 
Fort Augusta has been very negligent and inactive, not 

direction with wagons and great guns. An attack was apprehended, the 
country alarmed, the militia called out, and Colonel Stanwix's regulars 
were put in motion ; but it proved to be a false report. Dagworthy was 
either deceived by the Indians, or, what is more likely, he misunderstood 
their meaning. 

VOL. II. 31 U

to discover the enemy sooner. On the other hand, a 
blazed path in the eyes of an Indian is a large road ; for 
he does not distinguish, without a close inspection, be- 
tween a track which will admit of carriages, and a road 
sufficient for Indians to march in. 

These, Sir, are only my own sentiments, and I sub- 
mit them to your better judgment. We very well 
know, that from Fort Duquesne to Fort Cumberland 
there is a plain road already made, and bridges also. I 
shall, however, continue to pursue every means in my 
power to gain the earliest and best intelligence of the 
approaches of the enemy, and shall transmit it forth- 
with to you. I have sent Major Lewis fifty miles in 
advance of this place, with orders to keep out constant 
spies for intelligence, and to lose no time in forwarding 
it to me. 

We have received nothing new from Fort Cumber- 
land since the 16th. The Indians, who brought the 
first news, imagine, that some of Spotswood's party are 
yet watching the motions of the enemy. On the con- 
trary, I apprehend they are all cut off; for a man, who 
left Fort Cumberland the 16th, says, that the woods 
appear to be quite alive with hostile Indians, who show 
themselves openly in the day. This is unusual with 
them, unless they are strong. 

We work on this Fort, both night and day, intending 
to make it tenable against the worst event. Mr. Cro- 
ghan and others write you by this express, and will no 
doubt be more explicit on Indian affairs, than I can pre- 
tend to be, and to them I refer. I am, &,c.

TO COLONEL STANWIX. 

Fort Loudoun, 28 June, 1757. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your two favors 
both of the 22d instant. We were reinforced, upon the 
late alarm, by one hundred and seventy militia from the 
adjacent counties, one half of them unarmed, and the 
whole without ammunition or provisions. 

Had you, Sir, in consequence of Captain Beall's * 
suggestions, ordered me to reinforce Fort Cumberland, 
with part of my regiment, I should have given you proof 
of my willingness to obey your commands, by a speedy 
compliance with them ; but since you are so kind as to 
leave it discretionary with me, I freely confess, that I 
cannot entertain any thoughts of parting with the few- 
soldiers I have, to strengthen a place that now seems to 
be in no actual danger. Nor can I help observing, that 
I think it a little odd in Captain Beall, after having re- 
ceived subsequent notice of the fallacy of his first intel- 
ligence, to intimate that it was reasonable to reinforce 
Fort Cumberland, at the expense of Virginia, which has 
a frontier to defend thirty times the extent of that of 
Maryland, and this frontier left solely to the protection 
of her few regular troops, t

f Colonel Washington was in some sort under the command of Colonel 
Stanwix, but to what extent he did not know, as he had received no in- 
structions on that head, and the Governor continued to issue his orders as 
formerly. At length the Governor wrote as follows; "Colonel Stanwix 
being appointed commander-in-chief [of the middle and southern prov- 
inces], you must submit to his orders, without regard to any you may re- 
ceive from me ; he, being near the place, can direct affairs better than 1 
can." This was peculiarly agreeable to the Commander of the Virginia 
regiment, for Colonel Stanwix was a military man, and a gentleman of an 
elevated and liberal spirit His letters bear a high testimony to his good

I flatter myself, that the account of an expected at- 
tack upon Fort Augusta [in Pennsylvania], will prove 
more favorable, than Colonel Weiser imagines ; for I 
have no conception, that a road fit for carriages can be 
cut within ten miles of a fort, without its being discov- 
ered by the garrison. 

The friendship and assistance of the Cherokees are 
well worth cultivating. For my own part, I think them 
indispensably necessary in our present circumstances, 
and am sorry to find such unseasonable delays in bring- 
ing them amongst us. Since Captain Croghan left this 
place, Antasity, an Indian warrior of that nation, with 
twenty-seven followers, has arrived here. He brings an 
account of many more that are coming ; but whether 
they will wait for Mr. Atkin's passport, or come on with 
their own, I know not.

to you. I am, &,c. 



sense, as well as to the delicacy of his feelings, the amenity of his temper, 
and the generosity of his character. 

Notwithstanding the above direction, the Governor did not cease to 
write, give commands, require returns, and utter complaints as usual, 
thereby increasing the endless perplexities and bewildering doubts, with 
which Colonel Washington was harassed in all his plans and operations. 

It has heretofore been seen, that he had requested leave of absence 
for a few days to attend to certain private affairs of a very pressing nature, 
at Mount Vernon. He afterwards repeated this request, and, as he seemed 
to be under two commanders, he thought it expedient to consult them 
both. The Governor answered ; "As to the settlement of your brother's 
estate, your absence on that account from Fort Loudoun must be sus- 
pended, till our affairs give a better prospect." Colonel Stanwix replied 
to the same request; "More than two weeks ago I answered your let- 
ter, in which you mentioned its being convenient to your private affairs to 
attend to them for a fortnight. In that answer I expressed my concern, that 
you should think such a thing necessary to mention to me, as I am sure 
you would not choose to be out of call, should the service require your im- 
mediate attendance ; and I hope you will always take that liberty upon 
yourself, which I hope you will now do."

TO COLONEL STANWIX. 

Fort Loudoun, 30 July, 1757. 

DEAR SIR, 

My former letters would inform you how little share 
I had in confining the Indians hi the public jail at this 
place. * 

Mr. Atkin, in his Majesty's name, applied to me as 
commanding officer for aid to secure these people, 
which I thereupon rendered, but not without first 
representing the consequences, that might and in some 
measure really did happen. This step was no sooner 
taken, than the Cherokees in town, about twenty-two in 
number, despatched a runner to inform their people, 
that the English had fallen upon their brethren, and de- 
sired that they (the Cherokees) would stand upon their 
defence. Another runner, you know, went to Carlisle 
to inform the warriors there, who returned fully resolved 
to rescue the prisoners, or die in the attempt. The 
former they effected, and were so enraged with Mr. At- 
kin, that they would hold no conference with him the 
next day, when he sent to desire it, till they had first 
been with me for information. I took great pains to 
convince them, that it was a mistake, and happily suc- 
ceeded. They agreed to send an Indian to their nation 
with an express, whom I might procure, to prevent a 
massacre of all the traders and white people there, 
which they looked upon as inevitable, unless timely 
measures were taken to prevent it. 

Out of the great number of drafts that have deserted 
from us, we have been able to apprehend twenty -two ; 
of whom two were hanged on Thursday last. The

eight companies now remaining in Virginia are com- 
pleted to about eighty men each, rank and file, four 
commanding officers, four sergeants, and two drummers, 
and are all marched to the several posts assigned them. 
The commission, which I have received from Gover- 
nor Dinwiddie, to hold general courts-martial, is very 
long, and rather a repetition of the act. I should be 
obliged, if you would let me know whether this be right 
or not. I am, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 27 August, 1757. 

SIR, 

The drafts from Lunenburg are arrived, to the num 
ber of sixteen, which does not replace the soldiers, that 
have deserted since my last. The drafts, when they 
were divided among the eight companies in July, com- 
pleted them to eighty-six rank and file ; and there re- 
mained over and above forty workmen, whom I detained 
at this place, as mentioned in a former letter. 

What the strength of the companies is just at this 
time, I am no more able to say, not knowing what casu- 
alties may have happened since, than I am to send your 
Honor a return of the regiment, which is impossible till 
I get my returns from the several out-posts ; and that, I 
believe your Honor must be sensible, is difficult and 
precarious, dispersed as the regiment is. I have given 
express orders, however, that those returns shall be 
made to me as regularly as the nature of things will ad- 
mit, and I shall not be wanting in my duty to forward 
them, nor shall I delay to send the companies' size-rolls, 
when they come to my hands. 

The enclosed is a copy of a report made to me by

two officers, who were instructed to inspect the pro- 
visions at Fort Cumberland. Mr. Kennedy, who was 
entrusted with the care of these provisions, is now there 
repacking and pickling them ; and when he has finished, 
I shall endeavour to do the best I can with them, but 
despair of turning them to the least advantage. 

A letter, which I received a few days ago from Cap- 
tain Waggener advises, that the enemy appeared upon 
the Branch, not far from his neighbourhood, their num- 
bers uncertain, killed several men, and captured others, 
without his being able to meet with them. On Sunday 
last, a small party of five Cherokees, who came here a 
few days ago, set out to war. 

Your Honor having asked my opinion concerning re- 
cruiting, I shall give it candidly as follows. I believe, 
unless we are permitted to enlist servants, we should 
spend much time to little purpose in this service ; such 
a spirit of opposition prevails in one sort of people, and 
so little spirit of any kind in another. I never thought, 
in the most distant degree, of recruiting for the ad- 
ditional companies, till the others were complete ; nor 
should I have mentioned that subject, had I not sup- 
posed it was required by the act of Assembly. 

As you were pleased to leave it to my discretion to 
punish or pardon the criminals, I have resolved on the 
latter, since I find example of so little weight, and since 
those poor unhappy criminals have undergone no small 
pain of body and mind, in a dark prison, closely ironed. 

I have filled up a commission for Sergeant Flint, and 
will send it to him by the first safe conveyance. Colo- 
nel Stanwix, I am told (the truth of which I doubt), has 
marched to the northward. I have had no account from 
him these four weeks. 

Mr. Boyd, to whom I have spoken on the matter, 
conceives, that there will be no money left for contin- 



248 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEv.25. 

gent expenses, when he has paid the troops. I shall 
do as your Honor directs, with regard to escorting 
Mr. Boyd to Augusta, and ordering officers to wait upon 
him at this place, however inconvenient it may prove to 
the service. 

Nothing remarkable has happened, for which reason 
I have nothing in particular to add. I must beg leave, 
however, before I conclude, to observe, in justification 
of my own conduct, that it is with pleasure I receive re- 
proof, when reproof is due, because no person can be 
readier to accuse me, than I am to acknowledge an 
error, when I am guilty of one ; nor more desirous of 
atoning for a crime, when I am sensible of having com- 
mitted it. But, on the other hand, it is with concern I 
remark, that my best endeavours lose their reward, and 
that my conduct, although I have uniformly studied to 
make it as unexceptionable as I could, does not appear to 
you in a favorable point of light.* Otherwise your Honor 
would not accuse me of loose behaviour and remiss- 
ness of duty, in matters where, I believe, I have rather 
exceeded than fallen short of it. This, I think, is evi- 
dently the case in speaking of Indian Affairs at all, after 
being instructed in very express terms, "not to have 
any concern with or management of Indian affairs" 
This has caused me to forbear mentioning the Indians 
in any of my letters to you of late, and to leave the mis- 
understanding, which you speak of, between Mr. Atkin 
and the Indians, to be related by him, knowing that he 
maintained a correspondence with you on matters rela- 

* In the letter to which this was an answer, the Governor had used 
much freedom of complaint and censure. 

" You have sent a detachment from the regiment to Augusta," he ob- 
serves, " but you do not mention the number ; nor do you mention the 
receipt of the small arms sent from this; nor any account of the misunder- 
standing with the Indians at Winchester. You must allow this is a loose 
way of writing, and it is your duty to be more particular to me." 



PART I.] THE FRENCH WAR. 249 

tive to his office. But, with regard to the accounts, 
when he would have nothing to do with them, and 
when I was hourly importuned for the payment, and 
knew I had not the means, what could I do less than 
promise the people, that I would recommend their cases 
to your Honor, in hopes that you would appoint a per- 
son, in whom you could confide, to take in and pay off 
their accounts, as I always looked upon it to be a duty 
distinct from mine, and therefore was unwilling to inter- 
meddle in the affair? 

I really thought it unnecessary to say more, than that 
" the detachment destined for Augusta had marched," 
because your Honor gave me a copy of the result of the 
council held at Philadelphia, which directed one hun- 
dred and fifty men to be posted at Dickinson's, and one 
hundred at Vass's, which direction I observed, and I 
thought it would be sufficiently understood when I 
wrote as above, 

I should have acknowledged the receipt of the arms, 
had they come to hand, but they were not arrived when 
my last was written ; which obliged me to disarm the 
men remaining here, in order to supply those who 
marched, rather than detain them, as I had sent wagons 
to Falmouth to bring the arms from thence. However, 
if I have erred in these points, I am sorry for it, and 
shall endeavour for the future to be as particular and 
satisfactory, in my accounts of these things, as possible. 

I am, with due respect, 
Your Honor's most obedient, humble servant.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 



SIR, 



Fort Loudoun, 17 September, 1757. 



Your favor of the 2d instant came safe to hand, and 
Jenkins's* sickness has prevented my answering it 
sooner. 

I apprehend, that thirteen of the twenty -nine drafts 
from Lunenburg have deserted, as sixteen only have ar- 
rived here, and I have no accounts of any more being 
on their march. Your Honor may observe by the en- 
closed list of deserters, all of whom have left the regi- 
ment since the last return, and after having received 
their clothes, arms, and bounty money, how prevalent 
still is that infamous practice among the dastardly drafts, 
especially at this garrison, where I indulge them in 
every thing but idleness, and in that I cannot, the nature 
of the work requiring the contrary. Lenity, so far from 
producing its desired effects, rather emboldens them in 
these villanous acts. One of those condemned to be 
hanged, deserted immediately upon receiving his par- 
don. In short, they tire my patience, and almost weary 
me to death. The expense of pursuing them is very 
considerable, and to suffer them to escape, without pur- 
suit, is giving up the point, although we have had but 
little success of late. 

The uncertain and difficult communication with the 
out-posts must apologize for my not sending you a re- 
turn of our strength for August. The second month 
will always be far advanced, before I can get in the re- 
turns of the preceding, as the month must be first ex- 
pired, before the returns can be made out, and then

some of them are to come two hundred and fifty miles, 
and great part of that distance through an uninhabited 
country. 

If special messengers are always sent with these re- 
turns, it will be a considerable expense. I should there- 
fore be glad if your Honor would be pleased to direct, 
whether they are to be sent to me by express, or by 
the best casual conveyance. In the one case, as I be- 
fore said, there must be a constant expense, and in the 
other, great uncertainty. By the enclosed return for 
July, you will see that our total strength amounted to 
six hundred and ninety-nine ; but, as many changes and 
casualties happened in that month, by reason of the 
drafts joining, deserting, and the companies not being 
properly formed, this return will, I apprehend, appear 
confused and irregular. Our present strength, I think, 
is about seven hundred. Major Lewis did, as he wrote 
you, march from this place with about one hundred and 
forty men only ; but then Captain Woodward, who also 
marched at the same time, with his company from the 
South Branch, joined him at Dickinson's; and these 
troops, with the men under Captain Hogg, formed a 
body of something more than two hundred and fifty 
men, agreeably to the number appointed at Philadelphia 
for the forts at Dickinson's and Vass's. 

I never expected, nor ever desired, that there should 
be an addition made to the number of those persons 
appointed to transact public business, much less that 
there should be one to settle every little affair. I only 
humbly proposed, that, as Captain Gist was empowered 
with your Honor's approbation to manage the Indian 
affairs here, and as he is to be paid for that duty by 
this colony, he should, as a more proper person than 
myself, take in and adjust the accounts against the In- 
dians, so often mentioned, since it cannot reasonably be

supposed that I, who am stripped of the help I once 
was allowed, and told that I should be freed from these 
things in consequence, can turn my hands and thoughts 
to such a multiplicity of business, as naturally arises ou 
of the variety of occurrences, occasioned by our scat 
tered and detached situation and the many extraneou 
concerns of the Indians. Every person, who sees ho 
I am employed, will readily testify, that very little re 
creation falls to my lot. Nevertheless, if it is yo 
order, that I shall collect these accounts, I will do it 
the best manner I am able, and that with cheerfulness ; 
but it will be some time before it can be accomplished, 
as I have turned them off once. 

The Indian chiefs, before they departed for their na- 
tion, warmly solicited me for some drums ; and, as I 
had none but those belonging to the regiment, which 
could not be spared, I was obliged to promise them, 
that I would acquaint your Honor with their request, 
that you might, if you thought proper, provide them 
against their return. 

Since my last, the enemy came to the Branch, where 
they killed four men, wounded one, captured a man and 
a woman, and burned some grain, notwithstanding the 
utmost efforts of the troops, who are constantly scouting. 
The people in that quarter are terribly frightened by 
this last irruption, and I fear can hardly be prevented 
from deserting that valuable settlement. 

When your Honor shall be pleased to order the va- 
cancy, occasioned by the death of Captain Spotswood,* 
to be filled up with the name of Captain M c Neil, there 
will be room for a lieutenant ; and should you bestow the 
commission on Mr. Fairfax, I shall take it infinitely kind, 
if you will oblige me so far as to send it immediately

Indians.

from yourself to that gentleman. * Although I esteem 
him greatly on account of his father, for whose memory 
and friendship I shall ever retain a most grateful regard, 
yet, making him lieutenant over so many ensigns of long 
standing, will occasion great confusion in the corps, and 
bring censure on me ; for the officers will readily con- 
ceive, that my friendship and partiality for the family 
were the causes of it. If Mr. Fairfax would accept of 
an ensigncy, the matter might pretty easily be accom- 
modated. The letter under cover to Colonel Fairfax is 
not yet come to hand. 

I have heard nothing yet from Colonel Stanwix ; but 
soon shall, as I wrote to him a few days ago, and ex- 
pect his answer. 

As we have not at this time either commissary or as- 
sistant here, it is not in my power to send a return of 
the provisions with any tolerable exactness. But I do 
not doubt, that Mr. Rutherford, our acting commissary, 
who is now below, has satisfied your Honor fully in 
this particular ; if he has not, I will take care to do it 
in my next. 

I doubt not your Honor will see the necessity of mak- 
ing an agreement with the contractors, for furnishing the 
Indians with provisions; otherwise they will take no 
concern in this matter. I conceive they are allowed a 
certain amount for each soldier, that shall be returned, 
and that Indians are included. If not, no persons will 
supply them on the same terms, that they do soldiers, 
for Indians eat and w r aste triple as much as soldiers. 

I am your Honor's, &,c. 

* The commission had not been solicited by Colonel Washington, nor 
waa the application of Mr. Fairfax's friends made through him, but directly 
to the Governor.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. J>T. i>5. 

TO GOVERNOR DLNTWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 17 September, 1757. 

SIR, 

A letter of the 22d ultimo, from Captain Peachey, 
came to my hands the other day, the contents of which 
are herewith forwarded.* I should take it infinitely 
kind, if your Honor would please to inform me, whether 
a report of this nature was ever made to you ; and, in 
that case, who was the author of it ? 

It is evident, from a variety of circumstances, and es- 
pecially from the change in your Honor's conduct to- 
wards me, that some person, as well inclined to detract, 
but better skilled in the art of detraction, than the au- 
thor of the above stupid scandal, has made free with my 
character. For I cannot suppose, that malice so ab- 
surd, so barefaced, so diametrically opposite to truth, to 
common policy, and, in short, to every thing but villany, 

* The letter begins by detailing a conversation, which the writer had 
lately held with Mr. Charles Carter, of Shirley, respecting a transaction in 
which Captain Peachey had been concerned some months before, on a 
mission to Williamsburg, when the frontiers were in great alarm from the 
incursions of the enemy ; and then proceeds ; 

" Mr. Carter says, that Mr. Christopher Robinson told him he heard 
Colonel R. C. say, that I affirmed, that my whole business at that time was 
to execute a scheme of yours to cause the Assembly to levy largely both 
in men and money, and that there was not an Indian in the neighbourhood ; 
that the frontiers, and even Winchester and the adjacent country, did not 
appear to be in any more danger at that time than any other. Mr. Robin- 
son also informed Mr. Carter, it was said, that that piece of deceit, or im- 
position of yours (as they term it), had lessened the Governor's and some 
of the leading men's esteem for you ; or, at least, they make use of it as a 
reason for their ill treatment, and the worse opinion they say they have 
of you than formerly. 

" I hope you know me better than even to suppose I could be guilty of a 
thing of this kind ; therefore, I shall only add, that you may depend I shall 
use my endeavour to trace the matter, till I find the person, that dares 
make himself the author of such a scandalous report. If you think fit to 
make use of the above, you are at full liberty to do so." 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 255 

as the above is, could impress you with so ill an opinion 
of my honor and honesty. 

If it be possible, that Colonel C., for my belief is 
staggered, not being conscious of having given the least 
cause to any one, much less to that gentlemen, to reflect 
so grossly, I say, if it be possible, that Colonel C. 
could descend so low as to be the propagator of this 
story, he must either be vastly ignorant of the state of 
affairs in this county at that time, or else he must 
suppose, that the whole body of inhabitants had com- 
bined with me, in executing the fraud. Or why did 
they, almost to a man, forsake their dwellings in the 
greatest terror and confusion ; so that, while one half of 
them sought shelter in paltry forts, of their own build- 
ing, the other fled to the adjacent counties for refuge, 
numbers of them even to Carolina, from whence they 
have never returned 1 

These are facts well known ; but not better known, 
than that these wretched people, while they lay pent up 
in forts, destitute of the common support of life (having 
in their precipitate flight forgotten, or rather been un- 
able to secure, any kind of necessaries), did despatch 
messengers of their own (thinking I had not represented 
their miseries in the piteous manner they deserved), 
with addresses to your Honor and the Assembly, pray- 
ing relief. And did I ever send any alarming account, 
without also sending the original papers, or the copies, 
which gave rise to it? 

That I have foibles, and perhaps many of them, I shall 
not deny. I should esteem myself, as the world also 
would, vain and empty, were I to arrogate perfection. 

Knowledge in military matters is to be acquired by 
practice and experience only ; and, if I have erred, great 
allowance should be made for the want of them ; unless 
my errors should appear to be wilful ; and then, I con- 



256 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



ceive, it would be more generous to charge me with my 
faults, and let me stand or fall according to evidence, 
than to stigmatize me behind my back. 

It is uncertain in what light my services may have 
appeared to your Honor ; but this I know, and it is the 
highest consolation I am capable of feeling, that no man, 
that ever was employed in a public capacity, has en- 
deavoured to discharge the trust reposed in him with 
greater honesty, and more zeal for the country's inter- 
est, than I have done ; and if there is any person living, 
who can say with justice, that I have offered any inten- 
tional wrong to the public, I will cheerfully submit to the 
most ignominious punishment, that an injured people 
ought to inflict. On the other hand, it is hard to have 
my character arraigned, and my actions condemned, 
without a hearing. 

I must therefore again beg in more plain, and in very 
earnest terms, to know, if Colonel C. has taken the lib- 
erty of representing my character to your Honor with 
such ungentlemanly freedom as the letter implies ? 
Your condescension herein will be acknowledged, as a 
singular favor done your Honor's most obedient, humble 
servant. * 

* To this request, Governor Dinwiddie replied, in a letter dated Sep- 
tember 24th; 

"Your letter of the 17th I perused, and would gladly hope there is no 
truth in it. I never heard of it before, nor did I ever conceive you would 
have sent down any alarm without proper foundation. However, I shall 
show it to Colonel C. when he comes to town ; but I would advise you not 
to give notice to every idle story you hear ; for if I was to regard reports 
of different kinds, I should be constantly perplexed. 

" My conduct to you from the beginning was always friendly ; but you 
know I had great reason to suspect you of ingratitude, which I am con- 
vinced your own conscience and reflection must allow. I had reason to 
be angry, but this I endeavour to forget ; but I cannot think Colonel C. 
guilty of what is reported. However, as I have his Majesty's leave to go 
home, I propose leaving this in November, and I wish my successor may 
show you as much friendship as I have done."

TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM PEACHEY. 

Fort Loudoun, 18 September, 1757. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your favor of the 22d ultimo came to hand about four 
days ago. In answer to that part, which relates to 
Colonel C.'s gross and infamous reflections on my con- 
duct last spring, it will be needless, I dare say, to ob- 
serve further at this time, than that the liberty, which he 
has been pleased to allow himself in sporting with my 
character, is little else than a comic entertainment, dis- 
covering at one view his passionate fondness for your 
friend, his inviolable love of truth, his unfathomable 
knowledge, and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in 
displaying it. These several talents he has, I think, 
exhibited in a most conspicuous manner to every per- 
son, who was in the least degree acquainted with the 
situation of affairs in this county at that juncture. The 
report of your false musters is equally absurd. 

You are heartily welcome to make use of any letter, 
or letters, which I may at any time have written to you ; 
for, although I keep no copies of epistles to my friends, 
nor can remember the contents of all of them, yet, I am 
sensible, that the narrations are just, and that truth and 
honesty will appear in my writings ; of which, therefore, 
I shall not be ashamed, though criticism may censure 
my style. I am, &,c.

258 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&> 

I detached in quest of the enemy, who committed the 
late depredations in this neighbourhood, are returned, 
after having prosecuted the most feasible measures, and 
exerted their utmost efforts in vain, in endeavouring 
to come up with the enemy and prevent their escape. 
Nor is this in any degree surprising. When the vast 
extent of country, the scattered condition of the inhabit- 
ants, the nature of the ground, and the disposition of the 
enemy, are collectively considered, it is next to impos- 
sible, that any of our parties should ever see the enemy, 
except when they possess such advantages as render 
their victory certain. 

The inhabitants of this valuable and very fertile valley 
are terrified beyond expression. Some have abandoned 
their plantations, and many are packing up their most 
valuable effects to follow them. Another irruption into 
the heart of this settlement will, I am afraid, be of fatal 
consequence. I was always persuaded, and almost 
every day affords new matter for confirming me in the 
opinion, that the enemy can, with the utmost facility, 
render abortive every plan, which can be concerted 
upon our present system of defence ; and that the only 
method of effectually defending such a vast extent of 
mountains covered with thick woods, like our frontiers, 
against such an enemy, is by carrying the war into their 
country. And I think I may, without assuming un- 
common penetration, venture to affirm, that, unless an 
expedition is carried on against the Ohio next spring, 
this country will not be another year in our possession. 

Sickness, and the different parties, which the dis- 
tressed situation of affairs here obliged me to detach 
from this garrison, so greatly retard the works, that the 
finishing of even the principal parts of them, before the 
winter sets in, will, I am afraid, prove impracticable. 

T understand there is a mortar and a number of shells

at William sburg, which would be of great service here. 
We have a quantity of round and grape-shot for six- 
pounders, but no cannon for using them. A few* pieces 
of that size would be an essential addition to our 
strength; and, as this is the only place we have, at 
which, were it finished, a stand could be made, in case 
of any formidable attack, I conceive nothing in our 
power should be omitted to make it as defensible as 
we can. 

Mr. Rutherford is not yet returned. Enclosed is a 
list of the persons killed and captured by the enemy, 
when last down. I am, &c. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 5 October, 1757. 

SIR, 

Both your Honor's letters of the 24th ultimo I re- 
ceived by Jenkins. As I cannot now send a proper 
monthly return of the regiment, for want of the remarks 
of the officers at the out-posts, I enclose an exact re- 
turn of our effective strength, and how it is disposed of, 
which will at present answer the end proposed. I like- 
wise send you the return of provisions, specifying the 
time they will serve. 

The assistant commissaries must still be continued, 
or some persons in their room, who, under the direction 
of a principal, would have purchased the provisions upon 
as good terms as any contractor. Besides, the com- 
missary used to act as wagon-master, supply the dif- 
ferent garrisons with candles, made from the tallow of 
the country's beeves, and do many things for the good 
of the service, not to be expected from a contractor. 

I shall take the earliest opportunity of communicating 



260 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [M-. 

your intentions, respecting the ranging company, to 
Captain Hogg, who, I am informed, is lying ill, in conse- 
quence of the bite of a snake at Dickinson's Fort, and 
will, I fear, be unable to raise the men. I apprehend 
the recruiting of one hundred men will be found a very 
difficult task. I am quite at a loss how to act, as you 
did not inform me upon what terms they are to be levied 
and supported, what bounty-money to allow, what pay 
to promise the officers and men, how they are to be 
clothed and supported, and what kind of commissions 
the officers are to have. If they should have the same 
bounty, that is allowed by the Assembly for recruits, I 
shall want money for that purpose. Enclosed is a copy 
of the last letter I received from Colonel Stanwix. The 
enemy continue their horrid devastations in this settle- 
ment. The day before Captain Lewis was attacked, 
twenty Cherokees, headed by one of the principal war- 
riors of that nation, marched hence to the South Branch, 
who, with the troops under Captains Waggener and 
M c Kenzie, will, I hope, secure that quarter. 

When Mr. Atkin went away, he took with him 
Mr. Gist and the Indian interpreter. Since that time 
several parties of Cherokees have been here, by which I 
and my officers were involved in inconceivable trouble, 
as we had neither an interpreter, nor any right to hold 
conferences with them ; no articles to satisfy their de- 
mands, nor liberty to procure them. These warlike, 
formidable people, although they seem to have a natural 
and strong attachment to our interest, will, I am afraid, 
be induced by such treatment to hearken to the press- 
ing solicitations of the French, who, by the latest and 
best accounts, are making them vastly advantageous of- 
fers. The Chief of the Cherokee party, who went last 
to the Branch, and who is said to be a man of great 
weight in that nation, was so incensed on account of 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 261 

what he imagined neglect and contempt, that, had we 
not supplied him with a few necessaries, without which 
he could not go to war, he threatened to return, fired 
with resentment, to his nation. In short, I dread that, 
by the present management of Indian affairs, we are 
losing the interest of those people, the preservation of 
whose friendship is of the last importance to the colonies 
in general, and to this in particular. 

I am sorry to acquaint you, that the quartermaster has 
misbehaved egregiously, embezzling and disposing of 
some of the regimental stores, and afterwards running 
away, and taking a man of the regiment with him. He 
had leave to go to Alexandria, to order up some of the 
stores left there, and managed his affairs with such cun- 
ning, that he was gone too long to be pursued, before 
he was suspected. 

I do not know, that I ever gave your Honor cause to 
suspect me of ingratitude, a crime I detest, and would 
most carefully avoid. If an open, disinterested behaviour 
causes offence, I may have offended; because I have all 
along laid it down as a maxim, to represent facts freely 
and impartially, but not more so to others, Sir, than to 
you. If instances of my ungrateful behaviour had been 
particularized, I would have answered them. But I 
have long been convinced, that my actions and their 
motives have been maliciously misrepresented. * 

* In pursuing the thread of intercourse between Governor Dinwiddie 
and Colonel Washington, from the beginning of their acquaintance, it will 
not be easy to detect many acts of the former towards the latter, which de- 
served expressions of gratitude. His first appointments were solicited by 
friends, whom it was the Governor's interest to oblige, and the duties of 
them were executed in such a manner, as not only to extort approbation, 
but to command the notice and applause of the whole country. By the 
discretion and good sense, which Colonel Washington displayed in all his 
early enterprises, by his unexampled toils, courage, energy, and patienco 
in his first campaign among the Alleganies, and by his brilliant conduct 
on the terrible battle-field of the Monongahela, he had acquired a reputa-

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mf. 25. 



As your Honor proposes to leave the colony in No- 
vember, I should be glad of liberty to go down to Wil-

next, if nothing should intervene, to settle some ac- 
counts with you and the Committee, which may not be 
done in so satisfactory a manner after you are gone. * 

tion, and secured a confidence among powerful friends, that were not to 
be overlooked or disregarded. 

Even after all these proofs of ability and character, it was by no good 
will of the Governor that he was made commander-in-chief of the Virginia 
forces. Colonel Innes was the favorite destined for that post. But, aside 
from the incompetency of this officer, he was an inhabitant of North Caro- 
lina, and, as such, unacceptable to the Virginia troops, who naturally pre- 
ferred a commander from their own colony. Nor did the Governor escape 
censure for his preference, on the ground of partiality to his countryman, 
he and Colonel Innes being natives of Scotland. Thus, constrained by the 
public voice, and contrary to his inclination, he gave the appointment to 
Colonel Washington. His conduct was ever afterwards ungracious, un- 
compromising, and indicative of any thing but cordiality and confidence. 
When he was solicited by the friends of Washington to write to the Earl 
of Loudoun in his behalf, what did he do ? He sent a despatch to Gene- 
ral Abercromby, containing a short and cold paragraph, desiring the Gen- 
eral to use his interest with his Lordship in favor of Colonel Washington, 
" who, he ventured to say, was a very deserving gentleman," and " he really 
thought had great merit" Again, when he asked permission to visit Lord 
Loudoun at Philadelphia, it was granted reluctantly and with an ill grace, 
though his presence there was important, not more on his own account, 
than that of the public. 

These facts exhibit but a small claim to gratitude. The defeat of Colo- 
nel Washington's warmest wish, that of obtaining a commission in the 
British army, may be justly ascribed to Governor Dinwiddie. Whether 
such an event would have been fortunate to himself, to his country, or to 
the world, is another question. Men are often instruments in the hand of 
Providence to effect ends beyond their foresight, and contrary to their 
design. 

* This request met with the following peremptory refusal from the Gov- 
ernor ; " I cannot agree to allow you leave to come down at this time. You 
have been frequently indulged with leave of absence. You know the fort 
is to be finished, and I fear when you are away little will be done ; and 
surely the commanding officer should not be absent when daily alarmed 
with the enemy's intentions to invade our frontiers, and I think you were 
wrong in asking it. You have no accounts that I know of to settle with 
me ; and what accounts you have to settle with the country may be done 
at a more proper time." 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 263 

The last alarm occasioned a great many of the in- 
habitants of this county to go off, and vast numbers are 
still moving. I fear that, in a short time, this very valu- 
able valley will be in a great measure depopulated. 
What further steps to take, and how to obviate so seri- 
ous a misfortune, I am quite at a loss. As I have 
hitherto neglected nothing within the compass of my 
power, it is very evident, that nothing but vigorous of- 
fensive measures, next campaign, can save the country, 
at least all west of the Blue Ridge, from inevitable 
desolation. 

Since writing the above, the express, whom I sent to 
Major Lewis, is come in, and brings returns of those 
companies ; so that you will now receive proper monthly 
returns for July and August. By these you will see, 
that our total strength amounts to thirty -two commis- 
sioned officers, forty -eight non-commissioned, and seven 
hundred and three rank and file ; whereof twenty offi- 
cers, thirty non-commissioned, and four hundred and 
sixty-four rank and file, are employed in this county and 
Hampshire. But six women are always allowed to a 
company, who draw provisions; and the officers re- 
ceive more or less according to their respective rank, as 
you will see by the estimate received from Colonel 
Stanwix, and forwarded to you some time ago ; which 
must be considered in the calculation. I am, &,c. 



TO COLONEL STANWIX. 

Port Loudoun, 8 October, 1757. 



DEAR SIR, 

I am favored with an opportunity by Mr. Livingston, 
to acknowledge the receipt of your agreeable favor of 
the 19th ultimo; and to inform you of a very extraordi- 



264 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 25. 

nary affair, which has happened at this place, namely, 
the desertion of our quartermaster. This infamous fel- 
low, as he has proved himself, after having disposed, in 
a clandestine manner, of many of our regimental stores, 
being called upon to settle his accounts (not that I, or 
any officer in the regiment, had the least suspicion of 
the roguery he was carrying on), pretended, that he 
could not come to an exact settlement without going to 
Alexandria, where some of the stores yet lay. Several 
of our soldiers deserting at the same time, he was sent 
in pursuit of them, which afforded him the desired op- 
portunity of making his escape. His villany was not 
laid open, before his departure, and was at last acciden- 
tally discovered. This person had been several years a 
sergeant in one of his Majesty's regiments, and in this 
character he served three years under me. During 
that time he gave such signal proofs of his bravery and 
good behaviour, as bound me, in honor and gratitude, to 
do something for him. And I therefore got him pro- 
moted to be quartermaster, as he was acquainted with 
the duty, and capable, I thought, of discharging it. 

We have had several visitations from the enemy, and 
much mischief done, since my last to you. About the 
1 7th ultimo upwards of twenty persons were killed only 
twelve miles from this garrison, and, notwithstanding I 
sent a strong detachment hence to pursue them, and 
ordered the passes of the mountains to be waylaid by 
forces from other places, yet we were not able to meet 
with these savages. 

On Friday sevennight, a body of near or quite a hun 
dred fell upon the inhabitants along the great road be- 
tween this place and Pennsylvania, and killed or took 
fifteen more. The mischief would have been much 
greater, had not an officer and twenty men of the regi- 
ment, who were then out, fallen in with and engaged

the enemy. Finding, however, that his party was over- 
powered, and likely to be surrounded, he retreated to a 
stockade, not far distant, in which they were besieged 
for three hours ; but the firing communicated an alarm 
from one habitation to another, by which means most of 
the families were timely apprised of their danger, and 
happily escaped. Our party killed one Indian, whose 
scalp they obtained, and wounded several others. 

I exert every means in my power to protect a much 
distressed country, but it is a task too arduous. To 
think of defending a frontier of more than three hundred 
and fifty miles' extent, with only seven hundred men, is 
vain and idle, especially when that frontier lies more 
contiguous to the enemy than any other. I am, and 
have for a long time been, fully convinced, that, if we 
continue to pursue a defensive plan, the country must 
be inevitably lost.* 

You will be kind enough, Sir, to excuse the freedom 
with which I deliver my sentiments, and believe me to 
be, as I really am, with unfeigned truth and regard, 
Your most obedient, humble servant. 

* From the time that the Virginia regiment was organized, it had been 
Colonel Washington's opinion, that an offensive war should be kept up 
against the enemy. In this sentiment Governor Dinwiddie agreed with 
him, and he urged upon Lord Loudoun the advantage of an expedition 
against Fort Duquesne. But the great operations at the north absorbed 
his Lordship's attention, and he placed the whole southern frontier upon 
the defensive. Hence the enemy made perpetual inroads, committing 
murders and ravages. Considering the weak state of the garrison at Fort 
Duquesne, a large portion of which had been withdrawn to defend the 
Canada borders, it was deemed an object of easy attainment, as no doubt

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES. 

Fort Loudoun, 25 October, 1757. 

SIR, 

I applied to the Governor for permission to go down 
and settle my accounts before he leaves the country, and 
to represent the melancholy situation of our distressed 
frontiers, which no written narrative can so well de- 
scribe, as a verbal account to a judicious person inclined 
to hear. In conversation, the questions resulting from 
one relation *beget others, till matters are perfectly un- 
derstood; whereas the most explicit writing will be 
found deficient. But his Honor was pleased to deny 
his leave, thinking my request unreasonable, and that I 
had some party of pleasure in view. * 

I have, in a letter to the Governor by this conveyance, 
endeavoured to set in as clear a light as I am able, the 
situation of our frontiers, and the disposition of the in- 
habitants ; and I shall aim also, in as succinct a manner 
as possible, to make you acquainted with the same. 

The inhabitants of this fertile, and once populous val- 
ley, are now become our most western settlers, save the 
few families that areforted on the Branch. The enemy 
have, in a great measure, ceased committing hostilities 
on the Branch, and fallen upon the people of this valley, 
and a considerable part of them have already removed. 
This, by persons unacquainted with the country, and 
the enemy we have to deal with, may be attributed to 
the cowardice of the inhabitants, or inactivity of the sol- 
diers, but by others it will be imputed to neither. No 



* In writing to the Governor, he also observed, "It was not to enjoy 
a party of pleasure, that I wanted leave of absence. I have been indulged 
with few of those winter or summer."

troops in the universe can guard against the cunning 
and wiles of Indians. No one can tell where they will 
fall, till the mischief is done, and then it is in vain to 
pursue. The inhabitants see, and are convinced of this, 
which makes each family afraid of standing in the gap 
of danger ; and by retreating, one behind another, they 
depopulate the country, and leave it to the enemy, who 
subsist upon the plunder. 

If we pursue a defensive plan next campaign, there 
will not, by the autumn, be one soul living on this side 
of the Blue Ridge, except the soldiers in garrison, and 
such of the inhabitants as may seek shelter therein. 
This, Sir, I know to be the immovable determination of 
the people ; and, believe me, I have been at great pains, 
before I could prevail on them to wait the consultations 
of this winter, and the events of the spring. 

I do not know on whom these miserable, undone 
people are to rely for protection. If the Assembly are 
to give it to them, it is time that measures were at least 
concerting, and not when they ought to be going into ex- 
ecution, as has always been the case. If they are to seek 
it from the Commander-in-chief, it is time their condi- 
tion was made known to him ; for I cannot forbear re- 
peating again, that while we pursue defensive measures 
we pursue inevitable ruin, the loss of the country being 
the inevitable and fatal consequence. There will be 
no end to our troubles, while we follow this plan, and 
every year will increase our expense. This, my dear 
Sir, I urge not only as an officer, but as a friend, 
who has property in the country and is unwilling to 
lose it. This it is, also, that makes me anxious for 
doing more than barely to represent these matters, 
which is all that is expected of an officer commanding. 

It is not possible for me to convey a just sense of the 
posture of our affairs. It would be vain to attempt it 



26b WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^ET.25. 

I, therefore, content myself with entreating you to use 
'our influence to prevent such delays, as we have 
dtherto met with, if you think this affair depends on 
the Assembly. If you think the Assembly have done 
all in their power, and that recourse must be had else- 
where, I am determined, as I will spare neither cost nor 
pains, to apply to Colonel Stanwix (who commands in 
this quarter, with whom I am acquainted, and from 
whom I have received several kind and affectionate let- 
ters,) for leave to wait on him with an account of our 
circumstances. Through these means, perhaps, we 
may be able to draw a little of Lord Loudoun's attention 
to the preservation of these colonies. 

Pray let me have your sentiments. * I have not time 
to put my thoughts in a proper dress. The bearer is 
waiting, and I am in other respects hurried. But the 
truth of what I have asserted, believe me, is unquestion- 
able ; as well as that I am, with the most affectionate 
regards, your most obedient servant and friend. 



TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 

Fort Loudoun, 5 November, 1757. 

SIR, 

Duty to my country, and his Majesty's interest, indis- 
pensably require, that I again trouble your Honor on the 

* The Speaker, at the conclusion of his answer to this letter, after men- 
tioning the Governor's intended departure, writes, 

" We have not yet heard who is to succeed him. God grant it may be 
somebody better acquainted with the unhappy business we have in hand, 
and who, by his conduct and counsel, may dispel the cloud now hanging 
over this distressed country. Till that event, I beg, my dear friend, that 
you will bear, so far as a man of honor ought, the discouragements and 
slights you have too often met with, and continue to serve your country, as 
I am convinced you have always hitherto done, in the best manner you 
can with the small assistance afforded you."

subject of Indian affairs here, which have been impeded 
and embarrassed by such a train of mismanagement, as, 
if continued, must produce melancholy consequences. 

The sincere disposition of the Cherokees heartily to 
espouse our cause has been demonstrated beyond every 
doubt ; and, if they were rewarded in a proper manner, 
it would, in all probability, be the means of effecting a 
favorable change in the present unhappy situation of 
this part of his Majesty's dominions. 

But, instead of meeting with the encouragement, 
which their services and bravery have merited, several 
of them, after having undergone the toils and fatigues of 
long marches, destitute of the conveniences and almost 
of the necessaries of life, have, in that situation, gone to 
war, and behaved nobly, from which we have reaped a 
signal advantage. When returned here, with their tro- 
phies of honor, they must have gone home without any 
kind of reward or thanks, or even provisions to support 
them on their march, justly fired with resentment, had 
not I and my officers procured them some things, of 
which they were in absolute want, and made it the ob- 
ject of our care, in various respects, to please them.* 

Another party of those Indians since arrived oppor- 
tunely to our assistance, at the very juncture the enemy 
made an irruption into this settlement, pursued their 
tracks, came up with three of them, scalped two, and 
wounded the third. They are now returned from the 
pursuit, and are nearly in the same situation with those 
abovementioned. I applied to Captain Gist in their be- 
half, and told him I must represent the matter to your 
Honor. But he assures me, that he has neither goods, 
money to procure them, nor even an interpreter, being

with Indian affairs, nor furnished with any instructions on that head. An 
agent had been appointed for the purpose.

thereby incapable of doing any kind of service. It is 
surprising, that any man should be entrusted with trans- 
acting such important affairs, and not be possessed of 
the means. Thus he, and several others, who receive 
high pay from Virginia, are not only rendered useless, 
but our interest with those Indians is at the brink of de- 
struction. Whenever any of them arrive here, they im- 
mediately apply to me ; but I have neither any thing to 
give them, nor any right to do it. Nor is there a per- 
son, who can inform them to what these and their other 
disappointments are owing; which reduces me to a 
dilemma, from which I would most gladly be extricated. 

I must likewise beg leave to mention once more the 
vast hardships, which many of the people groan under 
here, from having been so long kept out of the money, 
that the country owes them on account of the Indians. 

When I proposed going down to Williamsburg, seve- 
ral of them brought their accounts to me, which I 
intended, had you given me liberty, to lay before your 
Honor. I mention this circumstance, not with any view 
of being employed in examining and paying off those 
accounts, which for many reasons I can by no means 
undertake, but in hope that your Honor will be pleased 
to give directions, and appoint some person to that duty, 
by the neglect of which so many poor people greatly 
suffer.* I am, &c. 

* This was his last letter to Governor Dinwiddie. It was duly an- 
swered, and further provisions were made for the Indians. 

Colonel Washington was now laboring under an indisposition, which 
shortly increased to an alarming illness. He left the army at the pressing 
request of the surgeon (Dr. Craik, his physician and intimate friend through 
life), and retired to Mount Vernon, where he was reduced so low by dys- 
entery and fever, that it was more than four months before he was able to 
resume his command. 

The Governor sailed for Europe in January. His departure was viewed 
with little regret by the inhabitants of Virginia, and perhaps with as little 
by himself. During his five years' administration, he had shown no de-

TO JOHN BLAIR, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.* 

Fredericksburg, 30 January, 1753. 

SIR, 

Hearing of the Governor's departure for England, I 
think it a duty incumbent on me to inform your Honor, 
that I lingered a long time under an illness, which 
obliged me to retire from my command, by the sur- 
geon's advice, and with the Governor's approbation, and 
that I am yet but imperfectly recovered, which is the 
cause that detains me from my duty. 

I have many accounts to settle with the Committee, 
and should be glad to obtain leave to go down for that 
purpose, this being the proper season, as our frontiers 
are quiet. I also wish to receive money for contingent 
expenses, before I return to Winchester, as there are 

ficiency of zeal or activity in discharging the duties of his office ; but his 
ignorance of military affairs, his high notions of the royal prerogative and 
of his own importance, his eagerness to control the money concerns of the 
public service, and his haughty bearing towards persons in subordinate 
stations, had neither wrought favorable impressions on the minds of the 
people, nor gained from them flattering tokens of confidence and esteem. 
Bold insinuations were thrown out, that his disinterestedness was not of 
the purest kind. The pistole fee was an irritating topic ; and, as it was a 
perquisite of the Governor, and revived by him contrary to the long usage 
of his predecessors, it was regarded as a suspicious symptom. When the 
Assembly appointed a committee to manage their appropriations, he was 
offended, and declared that his right was infringed. This was also re- 
garded to his disadvantage, as most persons holding a civil office are wil- 
ling to be as little embarrassed as possible with the responsibility of money 
affairs. 

* Mr. Blair was President of the Council, on whom, according to estab- 
lished usage, the government devolved when the governor left the colony. 

George Mason, the neighbour and friend of Colonel Washington, wrote 
to him on the 4th of January, urging him not to think of joining the army 
in the present state of his health, and adding, " You will in all probabil- 
ity bring on a relapse, and render yourself incapable of serving the public 
at a time, when there may be the utmost occasion. There is nothing 
more certain, than that a gentleman in your station owes the care of his 
health and his life not only to himself and his friends, but to his country."

several demands, on the public account, that I should be 
glad to be provided against. And further, I shall at that 
time have an opportunity of laying before you a state of 
the frontier settlements, a matter worthy of great atten- 
tion, as the well-being of the people depends on season- 
able and well concerted measures for their defence. 

If you have any orders for the troops under my com- 
mand, please to favor me with them, and they shall be 
forwarded, before I go down myself for the purposes 
aforesaid.

Your Honor's most obedient, humble servant 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 

Mount Vernon, 20 February, 1758. 

SIR, 

I set out for Williamsburg the day after the date of 
my letter, but found I was unable to proceed, my fever 
and pain increasing upon me to a high degree ; and the 
physicians assured me, that I might endanger my life by 
prosecuting the journey. 

In consequence of that advice I returned to this place 
again, and informed your Honor of the reason of my 
detention by the post, whom I met on the road, and 
who, I have since understood, never lodged my letter in 
the postoffice at Fredericksburg, which is the cause of 
my now writing to the same purport. When I shall be 
sufficiently able to attempt the journey again, I cannot 
say; but I shall make no delay after I am in a condition 
to perform it. I am, &,c.

TO COLONEL STANWIX. 

Mount Vernon, 4 March, 1758. 

MY DEAR COLONEL, 

Your two favors, with the extract of a letter from 
Lord Loudoun, were this day delivered to me. In the 
latter you condescend to ask my opinion of Major 
Smith. Pray, does not his plan sufficiently indicate the 
man ? Can there be a better index to his abilities, than 
his scheme for reducing the enemy on the Ohio, and his 
expeditious march of a thousand men to Detroit? Surely, 
he intended to provide them with wings to facilitate their 
passage over so mountainous and extensive a country, 
or in what way else could he accomplish it 1 

I am unacquainted with the navigation of the rivers 
he proposes to traverse, and, consequently, cannot be a 
competent judge of his scheme in this respect ; but the 
distance is so great, and that through an enemy's coun- 
try, that, I candidly confess, it appears to me a romantic 
plan, not to be executed. For, if we are strong enough 
to attempt the reduction of the Ohio, what necessity is 
there for our making such a circuitous march, and leav- 
ing Fort Duquesne behind us, which is the source of all 
our ills? If we are too w r eak to attempt that place, 
what have we not to dread from leaving it in our rear ? 

These, Sir, are my sentiments upon Major Smith's 
project. With regard to the person, if I have been 
rightly informed, he actually had a commission to com- 
mand a ranging company, and obtained it by making 
promises, which he never could comply with. He was 
adjudged, by persons better acquainted with him than I 
am, to be quite unfit to command even a company. He 
lost the Block-House, in which he commanded, by suf- 
fering his men to straggle from it at pleasure, which the 
Indians observing, took advantage of his weakness, and

attacked him at a time when he had no men in his 
works. It is, nevertheless, agreed on all hands, that he 
made a gallant defence, but I never before heard of any 
capitulation that was granted to him. 

I have not had the pleasure of seeing Major Smith, 
though I have been favored with a letter from him, in 
which he politely professes some concern at hearing 
of my indisposition, as it prevented him from seeing me 
at Winchester ; but he desires, at the same time, that I 
will attend him at his house in Augusta, about two hun- 
dred miles off, or in Williamsburg by the 20th instant, 
when, I suppose, he intends to honor me with Ms 
orders. * 

I have never been able to return to my command, 
since I wrote to you last, my disorder at times returning 
obstinately upon me, in spite of the efforts of all the sons 
of jEsculapius, whom I have hitherto consulted. At 
certain periods I have been reduced to great extremity, 
and have now too much reason to apprehend an ap- 
proaching decay, being visited with several symptoms 
of such a disease. 

I am at this time under' a strict regimen, and shall set 
out to-morrow for Williamsburg to receive the advice of 
the best physicians there. My constitution is much im- 
paired, and nothing can retrieve it, but the greatest care 
and the most circumspect course of life. This being 
the case, as I have now no prospect left of preferment 
in the military way, and despair of rendering that imme- 
diate service, which my country may require from the 
person commanding its troops, I have thoughts of quit- 
ting my command, and retiring from all public business, 
leaving my post to be filled by some other person more

capable of the task, and who may, perhaps, have his en- 
deavours crowned with better success than mine have 
been. But, wherever I go, or whatever becomes of me, 
I shall always retain the sincerest and most affectionate 
regards for you; being, dear Sir, your most obedient 
and obliged humble servant* 



TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL STANWIX. 

Fort Loudoun, 10 April, 1758. 

DEAR SIR, 

Permit me, at the same time that I congratulate you, 
which I most sincerely do, on your promotion, so justly 
merited, to express my concern at the prospect of 
parting with you. I can truly say, that it is a matter of 
no small regret to me, and that I should have thought 
myself happy in serving this campaign under your im- 
mediate command. But every thing, I hope, is ordered 
for the best, and it is our duty to submit. I must, nev- 
ertheless, beg, that you will add one more kindness to 
the many I have experienced, and that is, to mention 
me in favorable terms to General Forbes, if you are ac- 
quainted with that gentleman, not as a person, who 
would depend upon him for further recommendation to 

* Soon after writing- this letter, he went to Williamsburg. Having at- 
tended to the necessary affairs, which called him there, he returned to 
his command at Fort Loudoun about the 1st of April. 

While he was in Williamsburg the Assembly was in session, and an act 
passed to augment the forces of the colony to two thousand men, besides 
the three companies of rangers. A bounty of ten pounds was to be paid 
to every new recruit A second regiment was organized, and officers ap- 
pointed. By the same act, all the Virginia forces were to be united, by 
direction of the president, or commander-in-chief, to such troops as should 
be furnished by his Majesty, or by the other colonies, for a general expe- 
dition against the enemy, and were to be subject to the orders of the com- 
manding officer of his Majesty's forces in America. 



276 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 26. 

military preferment (for I have long conquered all such 
inclinations, and shall serve this campaign merely for 
the purpose of affording my best endeavours to bring 
matters to a conclusion), but as a person, who would 
gladly be distinguished in some measure from the com- 
mon run of provincial officers, as I understand there will 
be a motley herd of us. * 

Nothing can contribute more to his Majesty's interest 
in this quarter, than an early campaign, or a speedy 
junction of the troops to be employed in this service. 
Without this, I fear the Indians will with difficulty be 
restrained from returning to their nation before we as- 
semble, and, in that event, no words can tell how much 
they will be missed. It is an affair of great importance, 
and ought to claim the closest attention of the com- 
manding officer. On the assistance of these people the 
security of our march very much depends. 

Great care should be taken, also, to lay in a supply 
of proper goods for them. The Indians are mercenary ; 
every service of theirs must be purchased; and they 
are easily offended, being thoroughly sensible of their 
own importance. Upwards of five hundred are already 
come to this place, the greater part of whom are gone 
to war. Many others are daily expected, and we have 
neither arms nor clothes suitable to give them. Nor, 
indeed, is it reasonable to expect, that the whole ex- 
pense accruing on account of these people should fall 
upon this government, which has already in this particu- 
lar, as well as in many others, exerted its utmost abili- 
ties for his Majesty's interest, and, in the present case, 



* An expedition against Fort Duquesne had at last been decided on, 
which was to be conducted by Brigadier-General Forbes. The Virginia 
troops, and those of the adjoining colonies, were to be under his command. 
General Stanwix was removed to a station between the Mohawk River 
and Lake Ontario, where he built a fort, that was honored with his name.

shares only an equal proportion of the advantages aris- 
ing from Indian services. 

These crude thoughts are hastily thrown together. If 
you find any thing in them, which may be useful, be 
pleased to turn them to his Majesty's interest. The 
indulgence, which you have hitherto allowed me, joined 
to my zeal for the service, has encouraged me to use 
this freedom with you, Sir, which I should not choose 
to take unasked with another. 

If it .is not improper, I should be glad to be informed 
what regular troops are to be employed under Brigadier- 
General Forbes, and when they may be expected? 
Also, where they are to rendezvous. 

Fort Frederic, I hear, is mentioned for this purpose, 
and, in my humble opinion, a little unadvisedly. In the 
first place, because the country people all around are 
fled, and the troops will, consequently, lack those re- 
freshments so needful to soldiers. In the next place, I 
am fully convinced there never can be a road made be- 
tween Fort Frederic and Fort Cumberland, that will 
admit the transportation of carriages. I have passed it 
in company with many others, who were of the same 
opinion. Lastly, because this is the place [Fort Lou- 
doun] to which all Indian parties, either going to, or re- 
turning from war, will inevitably repair. 

I am with most sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient and obliged humble servant.

fatal to many of our former brave companions ? Yes ; 
and I rejoice at it, hoping it will now be in our power to 
testify a just abhorrence of the cruel butcheries exer- 
cised on our friends, in the unfortunate day of General 
Braddock's defeat ; and, moreover, to show our enemies, 
that we can practise all that lenity of which they onl; 
boast, without affording any adequate proofs. 

To cut short, I really feel a satisfaction at the pros- 
pect of meeting you again, although I have scarcely 
time to tell you so, as the express is waiting.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 

Fort Loudoun, 17 April, 175S. 

SIR, 

I think it incumbent on me to be informed by your 
Honor, how the regiment under my command is to be 
furnished with tents, ammunition, cartridge-paper, and 
many other requisites, that may be wanted in the course 
of the campaign. We expect here to be furnished with 
all those articles from his Majesty's stores, but it is ne- 
cessary for me to learn this from you. 

The last Assembly, in their Supply Bill, provided for 
a chaplain to our regiment. On this subject I had often 
without any success applied to Governor Dinwiddie. I 
now flatter myself, that your Honor will be pleased to 
appoint a sober, serious man for this duty. Common 
decency, Sir, in a camp calls for the services of a divine, 
which ought not to be dispensed with, although the 
world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of 
religion, and incapable of good instructions. 

I now enclose a monthly return for March, and am, 
honorable Sir, your most obedient, humble servant.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL FORBES. 

Fort Loudoun, 23 April, 1758. 

SIR, 

Permit .me to return you my sincere thanks for the 
honor you were pleased to do me, in a letter to Mr. Pres- 
ident Blair, and to assure you, that to merit a continu- 
ance of the good opinion you have expressed of me, 
shall be among my principal endeavours. I have no 
higher ambition, than to act my part well during the 
campaign ; and if I should thereby merit your approba- 
tion, it will be a most pleasing reward for the toils I 
shall undergo. 

It gives me no small pleasure, that an officer of your 
experience, abilities, and good character should be ap- 
pointed to command the expedition, and it is with equal 
satisfaction I congratulate you upon the promising pros- 
pect of a glorious campaign. 

The Indians seem to anticipate our success, by join- 
ing us, thus early, with seven hundred of their warriors. 
Captain Bosomworth, who held a conference with their 
chiefs, can fully inform you of their good inclinations to 
assist his Majesty's troops, and to him I refer you. Two 
things, however, I must beg leave to indicate, as likely 
to contribute greatly to their ease and contentment; 
namely, an early campaign, and plenty of goods. These 
are matters, which they often remind us of, both in their 
public councils and private conferences. 

I have received no orders yet to assemble the dis- 
persed companies of the Virginia regiment, some of 
whom are two hundred miles distant from this place ; 
so that, I fear, we shall make a sorry appearance at the 
general rendezvous. We are very much in want of 
tents, and have none with which to encamp the regi-

ment when it assembles. This fort cannot yet furnish 
barracks, nor can the town supply quarters sufficient.* 

I am, Sir, with very great respect, your most obedient 
and most obliged humble servant. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 



SIR, 



Fort Loudoun, 24 April, 1758. 



Your letter of the 19th instant, intended to come by 
Colonel Stephen, was received to-day about noon by 
express. As it contains several matters of an interest- 
ing nature, I chose to be aided in my determinations by 
the advice of my officers, and I now enclose their and 
my opinions on the several heads. 

I could by no means think of executing, willingly, that 
discretionary power, with which you were pleased to 
invest me, of ordering out the militia, f It is an affair, 
Sir, of too important and delicate a nature for me to 
manage. Much discontent will be the inevitable conse- 
quence of this draft. 

That was a most extraordinary request of Colonel 
Mercer's, concerning the exchange of officers, and 

* Colonel Stephen had just arrived at Fredericksburg with the two com- 
panies returned from South Carolina. These troops were daily expected 
at Fort Loudoun. 

f This power of drafting the militia, with which the forts were to be 
garrisoned while the regular troops were employed in the expedition, was 
conferred equally on the President, and the Commander-in-chief; a sub- 
stantial proof of the confidence reposed in the latter by the Assembly, al- 
though in this case, as in all others, he could not be prevailed upon to 
exercise a delegated power to any greater extent, than was absolutely 
necessary for a full discharge of the duties of his station. This control of 
that strong passion, the love of power, was one of the marked traits of his 
character, and a main cause of his popularity through the whole of his 
brilliant career. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 281 

calculated, it should seem, rather to breed confusion, 
than to benefit the other regiment.* There is not an 
ensign there, that would not rather quit the service, than 
accept of a company in the other regiment, so much do 
they disapprove Colonel Mercer's proposal ; and I have 
neither inclination nor power to force their compliance. 
Captain Rutherford's company was raised and posted in 
this quarter by Governor Dinwiddie's express orders, 
and can be more useful here, than any other men what- 
ever, being all sons of the neighbouring farmers, men of 
property, young, active, and acquainted with the woods 
on these frontiers. Whereas, if they go to the south- 
ward, they will be utter strangers to the enemy's haunts, 
and of no more use there, than the militia of an adjacent 
county; while their places here must be supplied by 
militia equally ignorant of these woods ; besides giving 
them a useless march of two hundred miles, and expos- 
ing the frontiers in the mean time. Another reason, 
which may be urged, is, that their property all lies in 
this county. Interested motives induced them to enlist, 
and to be vigilant in defending it, and, I believe, they 
would desert, rather than go to the southward. 

Your Honor will please to remember, that one of the 
last questions, which I had an opportunity of asking, 
was, whether I should send out recruiting parties. You 
replied, " that, since the Assembly was so near meeting, 
you would defer giving any directions on that head." 
As I had no money for the purpose, I hope it will not 
seem surprising, that we have recruited but few men 
since. I have been waiting for orders to complete the 
regiment. I shall now use my best endeavours, with 
the very few officers, who can be spared from the gar- 
risons, dispersed as we are. I am, &c.

TO SIR JOHN ST. CLAIR.* 

Fort Loudoun, 27 April, 1758. 

DEAR SIR JOHN, 

The post, calling suddenly upon me, only allows me 
time to acknowledge the receipt of your obliging letter, 
and to inform you, that I have received Mr. President'^ 
orders to obey any command you shall be pleased t( 
honor me with ; also to tell you, that the two companies 
from Carolina were at Fredericksburg, and may be ex- 
pected here daily. 

I have made known the contents of your letter to 
Mr. Gist, who thinks himself extremely obliged by the 
care you have taken of Indian affairs. We do all we 
can to keep the Indians in temper, but I have still ap- 
prehensions, that many of them will return home, if the 
troops are long in assembling. 

It gave me real pleasure to learn from you, that my 
company was desired by the General, Sir John, and 
Major Halket. I shall think myself quite happy, if I 
should be able to retain the good opinion, which they 
seem to entertain of me ; for I have long despaired of 
any other reward for my services, than the satisfaction 
arising from the esteem of my friends. 

I am, with great regard, yours, &,c. 



TO MAJOR FRANCIS HALKET. 

Fort Loudoun, 11 May, 1758. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am this day favored with yours of the 4th instant, 
and should have thought myself extremely culpable and

deficient in my duty, had I delayed one moment in 
transmitting to the General any intelligence I could pro- 
cure ; much more in a matter so material as that upon 
which he has been informed. I must, therefore, beg 
that you will, from me, assure the General, that the 
Catawbas have not this year brought in one prisoner or 
scalp to this place, nor indeed to any other that I have 
heard of. No prisoner has been taken by any of our 
friendly Indians this season, and no scalps, except the 
two taken near Fort Duquesne by Ucahula,* of which, 
and all the intelligence of the enemy in that quarter, 
which that young warrior was able to give, I, by the last 
post, sent to the General a full and circumstantial ac- 
count. Nor would I have failed to keep him duly in- 
formed of every interesting occurrence, even had it not 
been recommended to me. 

It gave me no small uneasiness to be informed of the 
resolution of some of the Cherokees, to wander towards 
the Indian settlements in Maryland and Pennsylvania, 
clearly foreseeing the bad consequences such a peregri- 
nation would produce. I therefore represented the mat- 
ter to Captain Gist in the strongest manner, and must 
do him the justice to say, that nothing in his power was 
omitted to prevent it. But our efforts proved ineffec- 
tual, as those two provinces last year, very impoliticly I 
humbly conceive, made presents to these Indians, and 

* This Indian went out with a party of six soldiers and thirty Indians, 
under the command of Lieutenant Gist. After great fatigues and suffer- 
ings, occasioned by the snows on the Allegany mountains, they reached 
the Monongahela river, where Lieutenant Gist, by a fall from a precipice, 
was rendered unable to proceed, and the party separated. Ucahula, with 
two other Indians, descended the Monongahela in a bark canoe, till they 
came near Fort Duquesne. Here they left their canoe, and concealed 
themselves on the margin of the river, till they had an opportunity of at- 
tacking two Frenchmen, who were fishing in a canoe, and whom they 
killed and scalped. These scalps were brought to Fort Loudoun by 
Ucahula. 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. ^T. 26. 



encouraged their returning thither this spring. Such is 
the nature of Indians, that nothing will prevent their go- 
ing where they have any reason to expect presents, and 
their cravings are insatiable. 

I and my officers have constantly paid, and always 
will pay, the strictest regard to every circumstance, that 
may contribute to keep the Indians in good humor. 
But, as Governor Dinwiddie ordered me not to meddle 
with Indian affairs on any pretence whatever, the sole 
management of them being left to Mr. Atkin and his 
deputy Mr. Gist, and those orders having never been 
countermanded, neither I, nor my officers, have adven- 
tured to do any thing relative to them, but in a secon- 
dary manner through Mr. Gist. 

The Raven warrior was on a scout, in which he was 
unsuccessful. On his return hither, he produced two 
white men's scalps, which he brought from his own na- 
tion, and wanted to pass them for the enemy's, taken in 
his unsuccessful scout. In this villany he was detected 
by the other warriors, who were highly offended at so 
base a deceit, and threatened to kill him. A conscious- 
ness of his guilt, and a dread of being called to a severe 
account by his own countrymen, were the reasons, 
which many of them assigned for his going away in so 
abrupt, but by no means unsatisfactory, manner to the 
English. As Captain Bosomworth was here transacting 
Indian affairs, under the immediate orders of the Com- 
mander-in-chief, when the Raven warrior returned and 
was detected, I only wrote in mine to General Forbes 
incidentally on the subject, referring him to Captain 
Bosomworth for particulars. 

Enclosed is my return for April, but you will please 
to observe, that Captain Woodward's is made out from 
his last, as his great distance from hence puts it out of 
his power to send it in due time.

I beg you will inform the General, that I shall, with 
great alacrity, obey all the orders, with which he may 
honor me. In the mean time, I am, with unfeigned re- 
gard, dear Halket, yours, &,c. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 

Williamsburg,28 May, 1758. 

SIR, 

I came here at this critical juncture, by the express 
order of Sir John St. Clair, to represent in the fullest 
manner the posture of our affairs at Winchester, and to 
obviate any doubts, that might arise from the best writ- 
ten narrative. I shall make use of the following method, 
as the most effectual I can at present suggest, to lay 
sundry matters before you, for your information, appro- 
bation, and direction. And I hope, that, when your 
Honor considers how we are situated, and the impor- 
tance of despatch, you will please to give me explicit 
and speedy answers, on the several points here sub- 
mitted. 

First, Sir John St. Glair's letter jvill, I apprehend, 
inform you of our principal wants, namely, arms, tents, 
and other sorts of field- equipage, articles so absolutely 
and obviously necessary, as to need no argument to 
prove, that the men will be useless without them, and 
that the vast sums of money, expended in levying and 
marching them to the place of rendezvous, will be en- 
tirely lost, besides impeding if not defeating the expe- 
dition. 

Secondly, the officers will be unprovided with the 
means of taking the field, till they have an allowance 
made them of baggage, forage, and bat-money. Gover- 
nor Dinwiddie, from what cause I could never yet learn, 



286 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 26. 

thought proper to discontinue this allowance to the 
companies that remained in Virginia, at the same time 
that he allowed it to those who went to Carolina, al- 
though I produced evidence under General Stanwix's 
hand, that all officers were entitled to it, and that it was 
essential to enable them to take the field. General 
Forbes has obtained this allowance for the Pennsylvania 
troops, and desired Sir John St. Clair to urge it strongly 
on this government also. 

Thirdly, the unequal pay of the two Virginia regi- 
ments will, I conceive, if a stop is not put to it, be pro- 
ductive of great discontent, and many evils. For the 
soldiers of the first regiment think their claim upon the 
country equally as good, if not better than that of the 
second, because their services are not limited. * They 
have lacked the great bounty, which the others have re- 
ceived, and have had no clothes for almost two years, 
although they have an annual call for clothes, and in 
strictness the same right to expect them. 

Fourthly, as our regimental clothing cannot possibly 
last through the campaign, will it not be advisable to 
obtain a supply for next winter? I have sent to Phila- 
delphia for one thousand pair of Indian stockings, or 
leggins, the better to equip my men for the woods ; and 
I now inquire whether I am to pay for them in behalf of 
the country, or deduct the cost out of their pay. As 
they have not received the clothing, to which they are 
entitled, they may think this latter a hardship. 

Fifthly, should not the pay of the surgeon's mates in 
the first regiment be equal to that of those in the 
second 1 The latter have four shillings and the former 

* The second regiment was raised only for the campaign, and, by the 
terms of the act of Assembly, it was to be disbanded, and the men dis- 
charged on the first of December ; whereas the soldiers of the first regi- 
ment were enlisted to serve during the war. 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 287 

only three per day. Should there not, likewise, be the 
same number of surgeon's mates allowed to the old as 
to the new regiment ? 

Sixthly, it will cause great dissatisfaction in the regi- 
ment, if Lieutenant Baker is put over the heads of older 
officers. It is granted, that Mr. Baker is a very deserv- 
ing officer, but there are others equally deserving, and 
who have adventured equally to seek glory, and to merit 
applause. 

Seventhly, Sir John St. Clair directs, in consequence 
of orders from the General, that the first Virginia regi- 
ment shall immediately be completed, and leaves the 
mode of doing it to your Honor. I should be glad of 
direction in this affair. The season, I fear, is too far 
advanced to attempt it now by recruiting. 

Eighthly, are the works at Fort Loudoun still to go 
on ? If so, in what manner are they to be forwarded, 
and under whose direction ? Nothing surely will con- 
tribute more to the public weal, than this fort when 
completed ; because it will be a valuable repository for 
our stores, if the event of our enterprise prove suc- 
cessful, and an asylum for the inhabitants, and a place 
of retreat for our troops, in case of a defeat. 

Ninthly, great advantages must arise, by appointing 
Lieutenant Smith to that direction, and to the command 
of Fort Loudoun. First, because he has had the charge 
of the works for nearly two years, and has, by that 
means, become perfectly well acquainted with every 
thing intended to be done. Secondly, because there 
must necessarily be many sick and lame soldiers left at 
that garrison, who may require the eye of a diligent of- 
ficer to keep them together. Thirdly, because all the 
regimental stores and baggage must remain at that place, 
and ought to be under the care of an officer, who can 
be made accountable for his conduct ; and not left to 



288 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T. 26. 



the mercy of an ungovernable and refractory militia. 
Fourthly, this is important, if for no other reason than 
to preserve the materials lying there for finishing the 
works. 

Tenthly, I conceive we shall be ordered to take with 
us the greatest part of the ammunition now at Fort 
Loudoun. It will be necessary, therefore, to have a 
supply laid in at that place for the use of the frontier 
garrisons. 

Eleventhly, in a late letter I endeavoured to point 
out, in what manner the service would be benefited, by 
continuing Rutherford's rangers in the parts they at 
present occupy, and sending the militia of Prince Wil- 
liam to the Branch. I again recommend it, for the rea- 
sons then given, and for many others, which might be 
given. 

I must now conclude, with once more begging, that 
your Honor will hasten some speedy determination on 
these several matters. From what Sir John St. Clair 
has written, from my orders, and from the statement 
here made, I conceive it must sufficiently appear, that 
the greatest despatch is necessary. The success of our 
expedition will, in a manner, depend on its early com- 
mencement. Every delay, therefore, may be attended 
with pernicious consequences. 

The Indians, glad of any pretence for returning home, 
will make use of delays for a handle ; and a spirit of dis- 
content and desertion may spring up among the new 
levies for want of employment. 

These are matters obvious to me, and my duty re- 
quires, that I represent them in this free and candid 
manner.* I am your Honor's most obedient and most 
humble servant.

operations on the southern frontiers, great preparations had been contem-

TO FRANCIS FAUQUIER, LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR 
OF VIRGINIA. 

Fort Loudoun, 17 June, 1758. 

SIR, 

Although but little skilled in compliments, permit me 
nevertheless to offer your Honor my congratulations on 
your appointment, and your safe arrival at a govern- 
ment, which his Majesty has been pleased to entrust to 
your administration. 

plated for a vigorous campaign under General Forbes against Fort Du- 
quesne. Mr. Pitt had lately come into power, and his zeal for the interest 
of the colonies had produced a change in the counsels of his Majesty's 
ministers respecting America. On the 30th of December he wrote a cir- 
cular to the governors of Pennsylvania and the several colonies at the 
south, requesting a hearty cooperation from the Assemblies in aid of Gen- 
eral Forbes's expedition. He stipulated, that the colonial troops raised for 
this purpose, should be supplied with arms, ammunition, tents, and pro- 
visions, in the same manner as the regular troops, and at the King's ex- 
pense ; so that the only charge to the colonies would be that of levying, 
clothing, and paying the men. The governors were, also, authorized to 
issue commissions to provincial officers, from Colonels downwards, and 
these officers were to hold rank in the united army according to their com- 
missions. Had this liberal and just system been adopted at the outset, it 
would have put a very different face upon the military affairs of the 
colonies. 

Major-General Abercromby, who had succeeded Lord Loudoun to the 
command in America, assigned six thousand troops to Pennsylvania, Vir- 
ginia, and Maryland, as their quota for the expedition to the Ohio. Of 
this number the Pennsylvania Assembly resolved to raise two thousand 
seven hundred. Votes, &c. of the Assembly, Vol. IV. p. 799. The Mary- 
land Assembly voted one thousand, but their bill was defeated by the usual 
quarrel with the Governor, who refused his assent to their proposed mode 
of levying the tax to defray the expense. Votes and Proceedings for 
March, 1758. \ 

The troops actually employed under General Forbes were twelve hun- 
dred Highlanders, three hundred and fifty Royal Americans, about twenty- 
seven hundred provincials from Pennsylvania, sixteen hundred from Vir- 
ginia, two or three hundred from Maryland, who had been stationed in 
garrison at Fort Frederic under Colonel Dagworthy ; and also two com- 
panies from North Carolina ; making in all, including the wagoners, be- 
tween six and seven thousand men. This army was more than five months 
penetrating to the Ohio, where it was found, at last, that they had to oppose 
only five hundred of the enemy.

I flattered myself with the hope of seeing your Honor 
at Williamsburg when I was down, but the business, 
which carried me there, was of too urgent a nature to 
admit delay on my part, after it was accomplished. 
Mr. President Blair has no doubt informed you of the 
nature of that business, and the state of the troops here, 
and, generally, of the situation of affairs in this quarter. 
I will not, therefore, trouble you with a repetition of these 
particulars, but enclose to you a copy of the last orders, 
which I have received, and which I am preparing to ex- 
ecute with the greatest exactness. 

Sir John St. Clair set out for Conococheague on the 
12th instant, to which place I accompanied him, in con- 
sequence of a summons from Colonel Bouquet.* He 
proceeded on to Carlisle, and I returned to this post, 
where at present I have the honor to command. 

When I was last in Williamsburg, I endeavoured to 
make Mr. President Blair and the Council sensible of 
the great want of clothing for the first regiment, and 
how necessary it was to send to England for a supply. 
They declined doing any thing in the matter at that 
time, because the funds granted by the late Assembly 
were almost exhausted. But I hope it will not escape 
your Honor's notice, if another Assembly should soon 
be called. Field-equipage of all kinds will also be 
wanted, and will be better and come much cheaper 
from England, than it can be had in this country. 

I have the honor to be, &c.f

TO COLONEL HENRY BOUQUET, COMMANDING 
AT RAYSTOWN. 



Camp, near Fort Cumberland, 3 July, 1758. 

SIR, 

According to orders I marched from Winchester on 
the 24th ultimo, and arrived at this place yesterday, 
with five companies of the first Virginia regiment, and a 
company of artificers from the second, as you may ob- 
serve by the enclosed returns.* My march, in conse- 
quence of bad teams and bad roads, notwithstanding I 
had sent forward the artificers and a covering party 
three days before, was much delayed. As I cannot 



ceived from Mr. President Blair, and all the gentlemen of the Council, all 
the information I could wish for ; but still, as I cannot be master of the 
state of affairs, I must desire gentlemen will be indulgent where I am 
wrong. I have enclosed to you the blank commission as you desire, and 
do not doubt but you will fill it with justice and advantage to his Maj- 
esty's service. 

" I am extremely sensible of all you say in yours of the 19th relative to 
the bad condition of the militia, and wish I knew how to redress it. How- 
ever, I will use my endeavours personally, and will recommend the same 
to the approaching Assembly at their opening. In some counties they 
have been mutinous (for so I must term it), and refused to go when drafted 
out, unless they might pick and choose their own officers. Whether this 
proceeds from any influence of the officers over the men, or from the ca- 
price and licentiousness of the men themselves, I know not ; but this I 
know, if complied with, there is an end of all discipline. I have ordered 
the names of all such refusers to be sent up, that they may be prosecuted 
according to law ; for to send fresh orders not to be obeyed is still weaken- 
ing the hands and loosening the reins of government. 

" I have received the returns of the two Virginia regiments. I grieve 
to see so many sick men, and wish they were complete to a man, to secure 
the conquest of Fort Duquesne, in which I wish you all possible success, 
and to obtain which you will oblige me by assuring the General and Com- 
mander-in-chief, and all under him, that nothing shall be wanting on my 
part."

way of Shippensburg, in Pennsylvania, and was now at Raystown.

suppose you intended to send any part of my men upon 
the roads, till joined at this place by Colonel Byrd, I 
shall decline sending any on that service till he arrives, 
which I presume will be to-morrow. 

There came twenty-eight wagons with me to this 
place, and I believe, if they were wanted, ten more 
might be had upon the South Branch, strong and good ; 
but carrying-horses are certainly more eligible for the 
service to which we are destined. I have received a 
very scanty allowance of tents for the five companies, 
namely, sixty-nine only. Out of these most of the offi- 
cers must either be supplied, or lie uncovered. They 
will readily pay for what they receive, if required. No 
bell-tents were sent to us. 

My men are very bare of regimental clothing, and I 
have no prospect of a supply. So far from regretting 
this want during the present campaign, if I were left to 
pursue my own inclinations, I would not only order the 
men to adopt the Indian dress, but cause the officers to 
do it also, and be the first to set the example myself. 
Nothing but the uncertainty of obtaining the general ap- 
probation causes me to hesitate a moment to leave my 
regimentals at this place, and proceed as light as any 
Indian in the woods. It is an unbecoming dress, I own, 
for an officer; but convenience, rather than show, I think, 
should be consulted. The reduction of bat-horses alone 
would be sufficient to recommend it ; for nothing is more 
certain than that less baggage would be required, and 
the public benefited in proportion. I am, &,c.

TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp, near Fort Cumberland, 9 July, 1758. 

SIR, 

Colonel Byrd, with eight companies of his regiment, 
arrived here yesterday. He left many sick men be- 
hind, and, as he posted a company at Edwards's and 
Pearsall's, our strength is considerably reduced. 

Captain Dagworthy informed me, that Governor 
Sharpe is to open the road to Town Creek, within fif- 
teen miles of this place, and, as Maryland has nearly 
two hundred men here fit for duty, I hope you will be 
of opinion, that they are sufficiently strong to proceed 
on the Fort Frederic road, without needing a reinforce- 
ment from us ; especially if you will consider, that they 
are in a manner covered by the troops here, and by 
those to be employed on the road to Raystown, to 
which service I shall send a detachment to-morrow. 
We have no hay at this place ; it was corn, which I 
called forage. We shall have tools enough to open the 
road to Raystown, among the artificers of Colonel Byrd's 
regiment. 

I am sorry to hear that the Catawbas have so egre- 
giously misbehaved. When I write to Governor Fau- 
quier, I shall touch on this subject.* 

It gives me great pleasure to find, that you approve 
the dress I have put my men into.f It is evident, that 

* Colonel Bouquet had written; "The Catawbas, under the com- 
mand of Captain Johnny, are gone to Winchester. They have behaved 
in the most shameful manner, and run away like a parcel of thieves, rather 
than warriors. They have never killed even a deer, and there is the 
strongest reason to suspect, that the scalp, which they pretend to have 
taken, was an old one. I think it very necessary to send a message to 
their nation to complain of their conduct, and know at once if they are 
friends or enemies. If you approve it, I shall be obliged to you to propose 
the thing to the Governor of Virginia."

soldiers in that trim are better able to carry their pro-

in, less liable to sink under the fatigues of a march, and 
we thus get rid of much baggage, which would lengthen 
our line of march. These, and not whim or caprice, 
were my reasons for ordering this dress. I am, &,c. 



TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp, at Fort Cumberland, 16 July, 1758. 

SIR, 

I was favored with your letter of the 14th instant, at 
eleven o'clock last night. The express, who brought it, 
informs me, that he was twice fired upon by Indians, 
and was obliged to abandon his horse to save himself. 

Three parties have gone hence towards the enemy 
within these few days past. The largest of them, con- 
sisting of an officer and eighteen Cherokees, marched 
three days ago. I always send some white men with 
the Indians, and will, to-day or to-morrow, send an of- 
ficer and a greater number of white men with another 
party of Cherokees, because you desire it ; although, I 
must confess, it is my opinion, that small parties of In- 
dians will more effectually harass the enemy, by keep- 
ing them under continual alarms, than any parties of 
white men can do. For small parties of the latter are 
not equal to the task, not being so dexterous at skulking 
as Indians ; and large parties will be discovered by their 
spies early enough to have a superior force opposed to 

" Major Lewis with two hundred men arrived here last night. I am ex- 
tremely obliged to you for this extraordinary despatch. Their dress 
should be our pattern in this expedition." And again, afterwards,

shirts and blankets."

them. Hence, in either case, there would be a great 
probability of losing many of our best men, and wearing 
down the rest, before the more essential services of the 
campaign would be entered upon, and this, I am afraid, 
without answering the proposed end. 

You are pleased to ask my opinion of the propriety 
of making an irruption into the enemy's country with 
a strong party. Such an enterprise, Sir, at this junc- 
ture, when we may suppose the enemy have collected, 
or are collecting, their whole force at Fort Duquesne, 
would require a formidable detachment, the supplying 
of which with provisions would be too difficult and cum- 
bersome to be effected undiscovered, as the enemy's 
parties are continually watching our motions. It is 
more than likely, therefore, that the enterprise would 
terminate in a miscarriage, if not in the destruction of 
the party. I should think it more eligible to defer such 
an attempt, until the army approaches more nearly to 
the enemy. 

I shall direct the officer, that marches out, to take 
particular pains in reconnoitring General Braddock's 
road, though I have had repeated information, that it 
only wants such small repairs, as could with ease be 
made as fast as the army would march. It is impossible 
for me to send out any men to repair it, as I have no 
tools for that purpose. If we had tools, and should go 
upon this road, the second company of artificers w r ould 
no doubt be wanted here ; but, as it is, I imagine they 
will be better employed with you. 

The misbehaviour of the Indians at your camp gives 
me great concern. If they were hearty in our interest, 
their services would be infinitely valuable. The best 
white men are not equal to them in the woods. But I 
fear they are too sensible of their own importance to 
render us much service. 



296 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 26. 

As the par of exchange between Virginia and Penn-

we can have no right to settle it on any other footing ; 
especially as any material deviation might be productiv< 
of very bad consequences. 

Since writing the above, the warriors of the party oi 
Cherokees insisted upon marching instantly, and that

to the road.

Captain Dagworthy returned hither yesterday in con-

TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp near Fort Cumberland, 21 July, 1758 

SIR, 

I had, before Colonel Stephen came to this place, 

abandoned all thoughts of attending personally the 

election at Winchester, choosing rather to leave the 

* Having resolved to quit the army, at the close of the present cam- 
paign, Colonel Washington had proposed himself to the electors of Fred- 
eric county, as a candidate for the House of Burgesses. The election was 
now approaching, and some of his friends had urged him to be at Win- 
chester on that occasion, fearing the successful activity of three rival can- 
didates. 

Regarding his duties in the army, however, as outweighing the con- 
siderations of personal interest, he remained at his post, and the election 
was carried through without his presence. He was chosen by a large 
majority over all his competitors. " Your friends," said one of his cor- 
respondents in a letter, " have been very sincere, so that you have re- 
ceived more votes than any other candidate. Colonel Wood sat on the 
bench and represented you, and he was carried round the town in the 
midst of a general applause, and huzzaing for Colonel Washington." 
Another friend wrote ; " From the bottom of a heart overflowing with 
gratitude, I beg leave to offer my congratulation on your happy election, 
doubly so in its manner, which, considering the vast majority of votes, and 
your having so long commanded the whole of that country in the worst of 
times, greatly redounds to your honor." 

As an indication of the mode of conducting a Virginia election in those 
days, it may be stated, that this poll cost the new Burgess thirty-nine 
pounds and six shillings. Among the items of charge, which have been 
preserved, are a hogshead and a barrel of punch, thirty-five gallons 
of wine, forty-three gallons of strong beer, cider, and dinner for his 
friends.

management of that affair to my friends, than be absent 
from my regiment, when there is a probability of its 
being called to duty. I am much pleased now, that 
did so. Colonel Byrd has given me your letter of yes- 
terday, in consequence of which I send you a return oi 
the forage. He writes to Mr. Gist, requesting him tc 
send vermilion for the Indians. 

We participate in the joy felt for the success of 
Majesty's arms at Louisburg, but sincerely lament th< 
loss of the brave, active, and noble Lord Howe. 

The bridge is finished at this place, and to-morrow 
Major Peachey, with three hundred men, will proceed 
to open General Braddock's road. I shall direct them 
to go to George's Creek, ten miles in advance. By that 
time I may possibly hear from you. If they go farther, 
it may be requisite to reinforce the party. But this 
matter, I suppose, will be ordered according to the route 
determined on by the General, for it will be needless to 
open a road, of which no use will be made afterwards. 

Colonel Stephen gives me some room to apprehend, 
that a body of light troops may soon move on. I pray 
your interest, most sincerely, with the General, to get 
my regiment and myself included in the number. If 
any argument is needed to obtain this favor, I hope 
without vanity I may be allowed to say, that, from long 
intimacy with these woods, and frequent scouting in 
them, my men are at least as well acquainted with all 
the passes and difficulties, as any troops that will be em- 
ployed. 

The General directs, that the troops shall be provided 
with covers to their locks. Where to get them I know 
not. There is but one possible way, and that is, by 
taking the hides of the cattle, and they will fall short. 
The commissaries ask eighteen shillings apiece for hides. 
I should be glad of your advice on this subject. What

is to be done with the wagons expected up in our next 
convoy ? I cannot exactly predict their number, but I 
suppose the provisions, forage, and stores, cannot em- 
ploy less than fifty. 

I am, with very great regard, your most obedient and 
obliged humble servant. 



TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp, near Fort Cumberland, 25 July, 1758. 

DEAR SIR, 

I do not incline to propose any thing, that may seem 
officious, but would it not facilitate the operation of the 
campaign, if the Virginia troops were ordered to proceed 
as far as the Great Crossing, and construct forts at the 
most advantageous situations as they advance, opening the 
road at the same time ? In such a case, I should be 
glad to be joined by that part of my regiment at Rays- 
town. Major Peachey, who commands the working 
party on Braddock's road, writes to me, that he finds 
few repairs wanting. To-night I shall order him to 
proceed as far as Savage River, and then return, as his 
party is too weak to adventure further. 

We have received advice that our second convoy, of 
more than seventy wagons, will be at the South Branch 
to-day, where I expect they will be joined by other 
wagons with forage. They will all proceed to this place 
immediately. 

I shall most cheerfully work on any road, pursue any 
route, or enter upon any service, that the General or 
yourself may think me usefully employed in, or qualified 
for, and shall never have a will of my own, when a duty 
is required of me. But since you desire me to speak 
my sentiments freely, permit me to observe, that after 



300 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JEx. 2d 

having conversed with all the guides, and having been 
informed by others, who have a knowledge of the coun- 
try, I am convinced that a road, to be compared with 
General Braddock's, or, indeed, that will be fit for trans- 
portation even by packhorses, cannot be made. I have 
no predilection for the route you have in contemplation 
for me, not because difficulties appear therein, but be- 
cause I doubt whether satisfaction can be given in the 
execution of the plan. I know not what reports you 
may have received from your reconnoitring parties ; but 
I have been uniformly told, that, if you expect a tolera- 
ble road by Raystown, you will be disappointed, for no 
movement can be made that way without destroying our 
horses. 

I should be extremely glad of one hour's conference 
with you, when the General arrives. I could then ex- 
plain myself more fully, and, I think, demonstrate the 
advantages of pushing out a body of light troops in this 
quarter. I would make a trip to Raystown with great 
pleasure, if my presence here could be dispensed with 
for a day or two, of which you can best judge.* 

I am, my dear Sir, with most sincere regard, your 
very obedient and affectionate servant. 

* In reply Colonel Bouquet wrote ; " Nothing can exceed your gener- 
ous dispositions for the service. I see with the utmost satisfaction, that 
you are ahove the influences of prejudice, and ready to go heartily where 
reason and judgment shall direct. I wish, sincerely, that we may all en- 
tertain one and the same opinion ; therefore I desire to have an interview 
with you at the houses built half way between our camps. I will commu- 
nicate all the intelligence, which it has been in my power to collect ; and, 
by weighing impartially the advantages and disadvantages of each route, 
I hope we shall be able between us to determine what is most eligible, 
and save the General trouble and loss of time." 

An interview accordingly took place, at which the subject was fully dis- 
cussed.

TO MAJOR FRANCIS HALKET, BRIGADE MAJOR. 

Camp, at Fort Cumberland, 2 August, 1758. 

MY DEAR HALKET, 

I am just returned from a conference with Colonel 
Bouquet. I find him fixed, I think I may say unaltera- 
bly fixed, to lead you a new way to the Ohio, through a 
road, every inch of which is to be cut at this advanced 
season, when we have scarce time left to tread the 
beaten track, universally confessed to be the best pas- 
sage through the mountains. 

If Colonel Bouquet succeeds in this point with the 
General, all is lost, all is lost indeed, our enterprise 
will be ruined, and we shall be stopped at the Laurel 
Hill this winter ; but not to gather laurels, except of the 
kind that covers the mountains. The southern Indians 
will turn against us, and these colonies will be desola- 
ted by such an accession to the enemy's strength. 
These must be the consequences of a miscarriage ; and 
a miscarriage is the almost necessary consequence of an 
attempt to march the army by this new route. I have 
given my reasons at large to Colonel Bouquet. He desired 
that I would do so, that he might forward them to the 
General. Should this happen, you will be able to judge 
of their weight. 

I am uninfluenced by prejudice, having no hopes or 
fears but for the general good. Of this you may be as- 
sured, and that my sincere sentiments are spoken on 
this occasion. 

I am, dear Halket, most affectionately yours.

302 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp, at Fort Cumberland, 2 August, 17. 

SIR, 

The matters, of which we spoke relative to the roads, 
have, since our parting, been the subject of my closest 
reflection ; and, so far am I from altering my opinion, 
that, the more time and attention I bestow, the more I 
am confirmed in it ; and the reasons for taking Brad- 
dock's road appear in a stronger point of view. To 
enumerate the whole of these reasons would be tedious, 
and to you, who are become so much master of the 
subject, unnecessary. I shall, therefore, briefly mention 
a few only, which I think so obvious in themselves, that 
they must effectually remove objections. 

Several years ago the Virginians and Pennsylvanians 
commenced a trade with the Indians settled on the Ohio, 
and, to obviate the many inconveniences of a bad road, 
they, after reiterated and ineffectual efforts to discover 
where a good one might be made, employed for the pur- 
pose several of the most intelligent Indians, who, in the 
course of many years' hunting, had acquired a per- 
fect knowledge of these mountains. The Indians, hav- 
ing taken the greatest pains to gain the rewards offered 
for this discovery, declared, that the path leading from 
Will's Creek was infinitely preferable to any, that could 
be made at any other place. Time and experience so 
clearly demonstrated this truth, that the Pennsylvania tra- 
ders commonly carried out their goods by Will's Creek. 
Therefore, the Ohio Company, in 1753, at a considerable 
expense, opened the road. In 1754 the troops, whom 
I had the honor to command, greatly repaired it, as far 
as Gist's plantation; and, in 1755, it was widened and 
completed by General Braddock to within six miles of 



PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 303 

Port Duquesne. A road, that has so long been opened, 
and *so well and so often repaired, must be much firmer 
and better than a new one, allowing the ground to be 
equally good. 

But, supposing it were practicable to make a road 
from Raystown quite as good as General Braddock's, 
I ask, have we time to do it ? Certainly not. To sur- 
mount the difficulties to be encountered in making it 
over such mountains, covered with woods and rocks, 
would require so much time, as to blast our otherwise 
well-grounded hopes of striking the important stroke 
this season. 

The favorable accounts, that some give of the forage 
on the Raystown road, as being so much better than 
that on the other, are certainly exaggerated. It is well 
known, that, on both routes, the rich valleys between the 
mountains abound with good forage, and that those, 
which are stony and bushy, are destitute of it. Colonel 
Byrd and the engineer, who accompanied him, confirm 
this fact. Surely the meadows on Braddock's road 
would greatly overbalance the advantage of having grass 
to the foot of the ridge, on the Raystown road ; and all 
agree, that a more barren road is nowhere to be found, 
than that from Raystown to the inhabitants, which is like- 
wise to be considered. 

Another principal objection made to General Brad- 
dock's road is in regard to the waters. But these sel- 
dom swell so much, as to obstruct the passage. The 
Youghiogany River, which is the most rapid and soonest 
filled, I have crossed with a body of troops, after more 
than thirty days' almost continued rain. In fine, any 
difficulties on this score are so trivial, that they really 
are not worth mentioning. The Monongahela, the larg- 
est of all these rivers, may, if necessary, easily be 
avoided, as Mr. Frazer the principal guide informs me, 



304 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



[Mi. 26. 



by passing a defile, and even that, he says, may be 
shunned. 

Again, it is said, there are many defiles on this road. 
I grant that there are some, but I know of none that 
may not be traversed ; and I should be glad to be in- 
formed where a road can be had, over these mountains, 
not subject to the same inconvenience. The shortness 
of the distance between Raystown and Loyal Hanna is 
used as an argument against this road, which bears in it 
something unaccountable to me ; for I must beg leave to 
ask, whether it requires more time, or is more difficult 
and expensive, to go one hundred and forty-five miles 
in a good road already made to our hands, than to cut 
one hundred miles anew, and a great part of the way 
over impassable mountains. 

That the old road is many miles nearer Winchester 
in Virginia, and Fort Frederic in Maryland, than the 
contemplated one, is incontestable ; and I will here show 
the distances from Carlisle by the two routes, fixing the 
different stages, some of which I have from information 
only, but others I believe to be exact* From this com-

putation there appears to be a difference of nineteen 
miles only. Were all the supplies necessarily to come 
from Carlisle, it is well known, that the goodness of the 
old road is a sufficient compensation for the shortness 
of the other, as the wrecked and broken wagons there 
clearly demonstrate. 

I shall next give you my reasons against dividing the 
army, in the manner you propose. 

First, then, by dividing our army, we shall divide our 
strength, and, by pursuing quite distinct routes, put it 
entirely out of the power of each division to succour the 
other, as the proposed new road has no communication 
with the old one. 

Secondly, to march in this manner will be attended 
with many inconveniences. If we depart from our ad- 
vanced posts at the same time, and make no deposits 
by the way, those troops that go from Raystown, as 
they will be light, with carrying-horses only, will arrive 
at Fort Duquesne long before the others, and must, if 
the enemy are strong there, be exposed to many insults 
in their advance, and in their intrenchments, from the 
cannon of the enemy, which they may draw out upon 
them at pleasure. If they are not strong enough to do 
this, we have but little to apprehend from them, in 
whatever way w r e may go. 

Thirdly, if that division, which escorts the convoy, is 
permitted to march first, we risk our all, in a manner, 
and shall be ruined if any accident happens to the artil- 
lery and the stores. 

Lastly, if we advance on both roads, by deposits, we 
must double our number of troops over the mountains, 
and distress ourselves by victualling them at these de- 
posits, besides losing the proposed advantage, that of 
stealing a march. For, we cannot suppose that the 
French, who have their scouts constantly out, can be so 

VOL. ii. 39 z * 



306 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 

deficient in point of intelligence, as to be unacquainted 
with our motions, while we are advancing by slow de- 
grees towards them. 

From what has been said relative to the two roads, i 
appears to me very clear, that the old one is infinite! 
better, than the other can be made, and that there is no 
room to hesitate in deciding which to take, when we 
consider the advanced season, and the little time left to 
execute our plan. 

I shall, therefore, in the last place offer, as desired, 
my sentiments on advancing by deposits. The first de- 
posit I should have proposed to be at the Little Mead- 
ows, had time permitted ; but, as the case now stands, 
I think it should be at the Great Crossing, or the Great 
Meadows. The Great Crossing I esteem the most ad- 
vantageous post, on several accounts, especially on 
those of water and security of passage ; but then it does 
not abound with forage, as the Meadows do, nor with so 
much level land fit for culture. To this latter place a 
body of fifteen hundred men may march with three 
hundred wagons (or with carrying-horses, which would 
be much better), allowing each wagon to carry eight 
hundred weight of flour and four hundred of salt meat. 

Our next deposit will probably be at Salt Lick, about 
thirty-five miles from the Meadows. To this place I 
think it necessary to send two thousand five hundred 
men, to construct some post, taking six days' provisions 
only, which is sufficient to serve them till the convoy 
comes up, by which time an entrenched camp, or some 
other defensive work, may be effected. From hence I 
conceive it highly expedient to detach three or four 
thousand of the best troops to invest the fort, and to 
prevent, if possible, an engagement in the woods, which 
of all things ought to be avoided. The artillery and 
stores may be brought up in four days from Salt Lick. 





PART!.] THE FRENCH WAR. 307 

From that time I will allow eighteen days more, for the 
carrying-horses to make a trip to Raystown for provis- 
ions, passing along the old path by Loyal Hanna. They 
may do it in this time, as the horses will go down light 
From this statement, and by my calculations, in which 
large allowance is made for the quantity of provisions, 
as well as for the time of transporting them, it appears 
that, from the day on which the front division begins its 
march, till the whole army arrives before Fort Duquesne, 
will be thirty-four days. There will be, also, eighty- 
seven days' provision on hand, allowing for the con- 
sumption on the march. Eighteen days added to the 
above will make fifty-two in all, the number required for 
our operations. These ought to be finished, if possible, 
by the middle of October. I am, &c. 



TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 

Camp, at Fort Cumberland, 18 August, 1758. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am favored with yours of yesterday, intimating a 
probability of my proceeding with a body of troops, on 
General Braddock's road, and desiring me to retain for 
that purpose a month's provisions at this place, a thing 
I should be extremely fond of; but, as I cannot possibly 
know what quantity of provisions may be necessary for 
that time, without knowing the number of men I may 
probably march with, and when it is likely I may leave 
this place, I hope you will be pleased to give me the 
necessary information on that head ; and, also, how this 
post is to be garrisoned, and what provision and stores 
should be left here.* 

* The General had determined to proceed by the new road, and sixteen 
hundred men were already in advance of Raystown, making their way 



308 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mv. 26. 

I have talked a good deal with Kelly upon the nature 
of the intervening ground between the new road and 
Braddock's, and, from what he says, I apprehend it im- 
practicable to effect a junction with the troops on the 
new road, till we advance near the Salt Lick, which is at 
no great distance from Fort Duquesne. How far it may 
be advisable to send a small body of troops so near the 
enemy, and at so great a distance from the army, with- 
out any tools for repairing the roads, or throwing up any 
kind of defences in case of need, I shall not presume to 
say. But I cannot help observing, that all the guides 
and Indians are to be drawn from hence, and that the 

across the mountains to Loyal Hanna. It seems there was still a plan for 
sending out a division by Braddock's road, with the view of forming a junc- 
tion with the main body on its march. This was discouraged by Colonel 
Washington, and, indeed, he had been opposed from the beginning to any 
scheme of dividing the army. It was at length abandoned. 

General Forbes had been detained by illness at Carlisle. He was now at 
Shippensburg, and was expected daily in camp at Raystown. The Virgini- 
ans and Marylanders believed he had been too much under a Pennsylvania 
influence, in resolving to make this new road across the mountains, through 
the heart of that colony, in preference to marching his army over an old 
one, which required but small repairs. Colonel Washington wrote to Gov- 
ernor Fauquier, " The Pennsylvanians, whose present as well as future 
interest it was to have the expedition conducted through their government, 
and along that way, because it secures their frontiers at present, and their 
trade hereafter, a chain of forts being erected, had prejudiced the General 
absolutely against the old road, and made him believe that we were the 
partial people, and determined him at all events to pursue that route." 

The Virginia Assembly, when they met on the 14th of September, were 
so much dissatisfied with the manner in which the expedition had been 
conducted, and with the partiality, which they imagined was shown to 
Pennsylvania, that they, thinking no attempt on Fort Duquesne would be 
made so late in the season, passed an act to withdraw the first regiment 
from the regulars on the 1st of December, and station it on the frontiers 
of their own colony. But about a fortnight after the Assembly broke up, 
the Governor received letters informing him that the expedition would at 
all events be prosecuted. He immediately called the Assembly together 
again, and another act was passed, extending the time to the first of Janu- 
ary. These particulars were communicated to Colonel Washington by 
Mr. Speaker Robinson. See the acts in Hening's Statutes at Large, Vol. 
VII. pp. 163, 251. 



PARTI.] THE FRENCH WAR. 

greater part of my regiment is on the other road,* so that 
I have but few of the first regiment remaining with me, 
and eight companies of the second only, whose officers 
and men cannot be supposed to know much of the ser- 
vice, or of the country, and nearly, if not quite, a fifth of 
them sick. I thought it incumbent on me to mention 
these things, that you may know our condition. At the 
same time I beg leave to assure you, that nothing will 
give me greater pleasure than to proceed with any num- 
ber of men, that the General or yourself shall think 
proper to order. 

With regard to keeping out a succession of strong 
parties on this road, from the troops here, I must beg 
leave to remark, that we have not so much as one pack- 
horse upon which to take provisions, having been under 
the necessity the other day of pressing five horses from 
some countrymen, who came to camp upon business, 
before I could equip Captain M c Kenzie's party for a 
fourteen days' inarch. We have not an ounce of salt 
provision of any kind here, and it is impossible to pre- 
serve the fresh, especially as we have no salt, by any 
other means than barbacuing it in the Indian manner. 
In doing this, nearly half is lost, so that a party receiving 
ten days' provisions will be obliged to live upon little 
better than five days' allowance of meat, a thing im- 
practicable. 

A great many of Colonel Byrd's men are very sickly ; 
the rest are become dejected. This sickness and de- 
pression of spirits cannot arise from the situation of our 
camp, which is undoubtedly the most healthy of any 
ground in this vicinity, but is occasioned, I apprehend, 
by the change in their mode of living, and by the lime- 
stone water. The soldiers of the first regiment, like

those of the second, would be sickly, were it not owing 
to some such causes. 

We have reason to believe, that parties of the enemy 
are about us, a wagoner having been shot yesterday 
afternoon, and his horse killed under him, not more than 
three miles from this place. 

We have no Indian goods of any kind here. It gives 
me great pleasure to learn, that the General is getting 
better, and is expected soon at Raystown. I am, &,c.

DEAR SIR, 

Twenty-five Catawbas came here this evening, and 
the convoy may be expected the day after to-morrow, 
as it was at PearsalPs last night. 

Governor Sharpe may be expected here in a day or 
two. I am at a loss to know how he ranks, and whether 
he is entitled to the command. In the British army his 
rank is that of lieutenant-colonel only, but what it may 
be as a governor, in his own province, I really do not 
know, nor whether he has any out of the troops of his 
province. I should, therefore, be glad of your advice, 
being unwilling to dispute the point with him wrong- 
fully, or to give up the command, if I have a right to it. * 

I am, &,c.

command of the troops, even in their own provinces, when they are joined 
with any other of his Majesty's forces, unless they have a commission from 
the commander-in-chief for that purpose. Governor Sharpe will not ex- 
pect to have the command as governor, and as lieutenant-colonel he can- 
not, nor do I suppose he would choose to serve in that rank."

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE 
OF BURGESSES. 

Camp, at Fort Cumberland, 1 September, 1758. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

We are still encamped here, very sickly, and quite 
dispirited at the prospect before us. 

That appearance of glory, which we had once in 
view, that hope, that laudable ambition of serving our 
country, and meriting its applause, are now no more ; 
all is dwindled into ease, sloth, and fatal inactivity. In 
a word, all is lost, if the ways of men in power, like 
certain ways of Providence, are not inscrutable. But 
we, who view the actions of great men at a distance, 
can only form conjectures agreeably to a limited per- 
ception ; and, being ignorant of the comprehensive 
schemes, which may be in contemplation, might mistake 
egregiously in judging of things from appearances, or by 
the lump. Yet every fool will have his notions, will 
prattle and talk away ; and why may not I ? We seem 
then, in my opinion, to act under the guidance of an evil 
genius. The conduct of our leaders, if not actuated by 
superior orders, is tempered with something, I do not 
care to give a name to. Nothing now but a miracle can 
bring this campaign to a happy issue. 

In my last, if I remember rightly, I told you, that I 
had employed my small abilities in opposing the meas- 
ures then concerting. To do this, I not only repre- 
sented the advanced season, the difficulty of cutting a 
new road over these mountains, the short time left for 



troops under Colonel Dagworthy, which had now joined the army, General 
Forbes advanced money for this purpose out of the King's funds, relying 
on the honor of the Assembly for a future reimbursement. The amount 
thus advanced was recognised and paid by the succeeding Assembly. 



312 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. \&T. 26. 

that service, the moral certainty of its obstructing our 
march, and the consequent miscarriage of the expedi- 
tion ; I endeavoured to represent, also, the hard struggle 
Virginia had made this year in raising a second regiment 
upon so short a notice, the great expense of doing it, 
and her inability for future exertion. I spoke my fears 
concerning the southern Indians, in the event of a mis- 
carriage. But I spoke all unavailingly, for the road was 
immediately begun, and from one to two thousand men 
have since constantly wrought upon it. By the last ac- 
counts I have received, they had cut it to the foot of 
Laurel Hill, about thirty-five miles ; and I suppose by 
this time fifteen hundred men have taken post at a place 
called Loyal Hanna, about ten miles further, where our 
next fort is intended to be constructed. 

We have certain intelligence, that the French strength 
at Fort Duquesne, on the 13th ultimo, did not exceed 
eight hundred men, Indians included, of whom there 
appeared to be about three or four hundred. This ac- 
count is corroborated on all hands. Two officers of the 
first Virginia regiment, Chew and Allen, have since 
come from thence, both in different parties, and at dif- 
ferent times, after lying a day or two concealed in full 
view of the fort, and observing the motions and strength 
of the enemy. See, therefore, how our time has been 
misspent. Behold how the golden opportunity has been 
lost, perhaps never more to be regained ! How is it to 
be accounted for'] Can General Forbes have orders 
for this ? Impossible. Will, then, our injured country 
pass by such abuses 1 I hope not. Rather let a full 
representation of the matter go to his Majesty. Let 
him know how grossly his glory and interest, and the 
public money, have been prostituted. I wish I were 
sent immediately home [to England], as an aid to some 
other on this errand. I think, without vanity, I could

man, to dive to the bottom of it. But no more.

TO GENERAL FORBES, COMMANDING HIS MAJESTY'S 
FORCES EMPLOYED ON THE OHIO EXPEDITION. 

Camp, at Raystown, 8 October, 1758. 

SIR, 

In consequence of your request of the Colonels as- 
sembled at your lodgings, the 15th ultimo, I offer these 
plans to your consideration. They express my thoughts 
respecting a line of march through a country covered 
with woods, and how that line of march may be formed 

* A few days after this letter was written, General Forbes arrived at 
Raystown, and Colonel Washington was called to that place. Fort Cum- 
berland was garrisoned by Maryland militia, under the command of Gov- 
ernor Sharpe. Meantime occurred the strange and unfortunate adventure 
of Major Grant, who had advanced with eight hundred men to Fort Du- 
quesne. A part of the Virginia troops was in this detachment, and was 
signalized by its bravery. 

"From all the accounts 1 can collect," says Colonel Washington, 
in writing to Governor Fauquier, " it appears very clear, that this was 
a very ill concerted, or a very ill executed plan, perhaps both ; but it 
seems to be generally acknowledged, that Major Grant exceeded his 
orders, and that no disposition was made for engaging. The troops were 
divided, which caused the front to give way, and put the whole into confu- 
sion, except the Virginians commanded by Captain Bullitt, who were, in 
the hands of Providence, a means of preventing all our people from shar- 
ing one common fate. Our officers and men have gained very great ap- 
plause for their gallant behaviour during the action. I had the honor to bo 
publicly complimented yesterday by the General on the occasion. Bullitt'a 
behaviour is matter of great admiration." 

Major Grant, as also Major Lewis, of the first Virginia regiment, were 
taken prisoners and sent to Montreal.

quickly into an order of battle. The plan of the order 
of march and order of battle, on the other side, is calcu- 
lated for a forced march with field-pieces only, unincum- 
bered with wagons. It represents, first, a line of march ; 
and, secondly, how that line of march may in an instant 
be thrown into an order of battle in the woods. This 
plan supposes four thousand privates, one thousand of 
whom, picked men, are to march in the front in three 
divisions, each division having a field-officer to command 
it, besides the commander of the whole ; and always to 
be in readiness to oppose the enemy, whose attack, if the 
necessary precautions are observed, must always be in 
front. 

The first division must, as the second and third like- 
wise ought to be, subdivided for the captains ; these 
subdivisions to be again divided for the subalterns ; and 
the subalterns again for the sergeants and corporals. By 
which means every non-commissioned officer will hav 
a party to command, under the eye of a subaltern, as 
the subalterns will have, under the direction of a cap- 
tain. 

I shall, though I believe it unnecessary, remark here, 
that the captains, when their subdivisions are again di- 
vided, are to take command of no particular part of it, 
but to attend to the whole subdivision, as the subalterns 
are to do with theirs, each captain and subaltern act- 
ing as commandant of the division he is appointed to, 
under the field-officer, visiting and encouraging all parts 
alike, and keeping the soldiers to their duty. This 
being done, the first division, so soon as the van-guard 
is attapked (if that gives the first notice of the enemy's 
approach), is to file off to the right and left, and take to 
trees, gaining the enemy's flanks, and surrounding the 
as described in the second plan. * The flank-guards o

the right, which belong to the second division, are im- 
mediately to extend to the right, followed by that divis- 
ion, and to form, as described in the aforesaid plan. 
The rear-guard division is to follow the left flankers in 
the same manner, in order, if possible, to encompass the 
enemy, which being a practice different from any thing 
they have ever yet experienced from us, I think may be 
accomplished. Such Indians as we have, should be 
ordered to get round, unperceived, and fall at the same 
time upon the enemy's rear. The front and rear being 
thus secured, a body of two thousand five hundred men 
remains to form two brigades, on the flanks of w r hich 
six hundred men must march for their safety, and in 
such order as to form a rank entire, by only marching 
the captains' and subalterns' guards into the intervals 
between the sergeants' parties. The main body will 
now be reduced to nineteen hundred men, who should 
be kept as a corps de reserve to support any part, that 
shall be found weak or forced. 

The whole is submitted with the utmost candor, by 
Sir, &,c. 



TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 

Camp, at Loyal Hanna, 30 October, 1758. * 

SIR, 

I am sorry to inform you, that, upon reviewing the 
six companies of my regiment at this place, which had 
been separated from me since my last, I found them de- 
ficient in the necessaries contained in the enclosed 
return. I am, therefore, under the duty of providing for 
them, or more properly of endeavouring to do it, as I

doubt very much the possibility of succeeding. You 
will not, I hope, be surprised, should I draw on you for 
the amount. 

Governor Sharpe in person commanded a garrison of 
militia, from his province, at Fort Cumberland, when 
the magazine was blown up. 

My march to this post gave me an opportunity ot 
forming a judgment of the road, and I can truly say, 
that it is indescribably bad. Had it not been for an 
accidental discovery of a new passage over the Laurel 
Hill, the carriages must inevitably have stopped on the 
other side. This fact nobody here takes upon him to 
deny. The General and great part of the troops being 
yet behind, and the weather growing very inclement, I 
apprehend our expedition must terminate for this year 
at this place. But as our affairs are now drawing to a 
crisis, and a good or bad conclusion of them will shortly 
ensue, I choose to suspend my judgment, as well as a 
further account of the matter, to a future day. * 

November 5th. The General being arrived, with 
most of the artillery and troops, we expect to move 
forward in a very few days, encountering every hardship, 
that an advanced season, want of clothes, and a small 
stock of provisions will expose us to. But it is no 
longer a time for pointing out difficulties, and I hope my 
next will run in a more agreeable strain. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to assure your Honor, that, with very 
great respect, I am, &c. 

* When the General reached Loyal Hanna, a council of war was call- 
ed, and it was determined not to be advisable to proceed further that sea- 
son. But the report of three prisoners, who were shortly afterwards 
brought in, and who communicated the weak state of the garrison at Fort 
Duquesne, induced a change of opinion, and the enterprise was prose- 
cuted.

TO GENERAL FORBES. 

Camp, on Chestnut Ridge, 11 o'clock at night, 
15 November, 1758. 

SIR, 

An express from Colonel Armstrong affords me an 
opportunity of informing you, that we arrived here about 
four o'clock this afternoon. I immediately ordered work- 
ing parties on the road, that no time might be lost in 
working it ; but I fear I shall not proceed so fast as you 
could wish, since, after all my delays, and waiting for 
tools, Captain Fields was able to get but forty-two axes. 
These, and the others that are here, shall be employed 
to-morrow at daylight to the best advantage. The road 
intended is but very slightly blazed. It may be neces- 
sary to send Captain Shelby forward to prevent mis- 
takes. 

This camp is about six miles from Loyal Hanna, 
where the new road strikes out.* I am, &c.

Camp, near Bushy Run, 17 November, 1758. 

SIR, 

After the most constant labor from daybreak till night, 
we were able to open the road only as far as this place, 
about six miles from our last camp. Captain Shelby 
here overtook us, and presented me with your and 
Colonel Bouquet's letters. A junction with Colonel 
Armstrong this morning would have prevented the good 
effects of a fortified camp to-night, and retarded our 
operations a day at least ; for which reason I desired

him to march forward this morning at two o'clock, and 
secure himself, as you desired. If he accomplishes that 
work before night, he is to begin opening the road to- 
wards me. 

If Indians can ever be of any use to us, it must be 
now, in the front, for intelligence. I beg you will, there- 
fore, order their conductors to bring them at all events. 

Camp, at night. Colonel Bouquet's letter came to 
my hands, just as the bearer was passing by, from 
Colonel Armstrong. I shall punctually observe all its 
directions, although I at the same time confess, that I 
think it would have been much safer and more eligible 
to march briskly forward to our second post, leaving the 
road for Colonel Montgomery to open. We should by 
that means have been a covering party to him, while we 
are fortifying a camp, which may be of great importance 
to the army. Less time would be lost in this way, and 
a straggling front, which will ever happen in expeditious 
cutting, would be avoided ; besides the probable advan- 
tage of getting into a secure camp before we should be 
discovered. 

I have opened the road between seven and eight 
miles to day, and am yet three miles short of Colonel 
Armstrong, who marched at eight o'clock. I understand 
by Captain Shelby, who is just come from him, that he 
has not yet begun entrenching his camp, which must 
again retard us to-morrow. Forwarding provisions is 
highly necessary ; hard labor consumes them fast ; but 
all the men are in high spirits, and are anxious to go on. 

I shall be much pleased to see the Indians up, and 
am very glad ta hear that Mr. Croghan is so near at 
hand. The number with him is not mentioned. I wish 
they also were in our front. 

I w r as extremely sorry to hear of your indisposition to 
day, being, Sir, yours, &c.

TO GENERAL FORBES. 

Armstrong's Camp, 18 November, 1758. 

SIR, 

I came to this camp about eleven o'clock to-day, having 
opened the road before me. I should immediately have 
proceeded on, but, as the bullocks were to be slaughtered, 
and provisions dressed, I thought it expedient to halt 
here till three in the morning, when I shall begin to 
march with one thousand men, leaving Colonel Arm- 
strong and five hundred more in this camp, until Colonel 
Montgomery joins him. I took care that the road 
should not be delayed by this halt, for I ordered out a 
working party, properly covered, before I came here, to 
cut it forward till night, and then return. 

I fear that we have been greatly deceived, with re- 
gard to the distance from this place to Fort Duquesne. 
Most of the woods-men, that I have conversed with, 
seem to think that we are still thirty miles from it. I 
have sent out a party in that direction to ascertain the 
distance, and the kind of ground to be passed over, and 
two others to scout on the right and left, for the discov- 
ery of tracks. 

I found three redoubts erecting for the defence of this 
camp. Mr. Gordon thinks, that it will be sufficiently 
secured by these means ; but, for my own part, I do not 
look upon redoubts alone, in this close country, to be 
half as good as the slightest breastwork ; indeed, I do 
not believe they are any security at all without other 
works. 

I enclose you a return of the total strength of this 
place, and the time for which we are served with pro- 
visions, by which you will see how much a supply is 
needed. I must beg, that commissaries and steelyards 
may be sent forward, otherwise a continual dissatisfac-

tion will prevail, as well on the part of the contractors, 
as on that of the soldiers, who think they have injustice 
done them in their allowance, notwithstanding that the 
fifteen bullocks, which were received as provisions for 
four days, were issued for three only, by the judgment 
of an officer from each corps, as well as my own, for I 
took pains to examine into it myself. 

I had written thus far, when your favor of this morn- 
ing came to hand. I shall set out at three o'clock, as 
above, leaving the Highlanders to finish the redoubts, 
according to Mr. Gordon's plan, and to secure the tools, 
until Colonel Montgomery comes up, submitting it then 
to Colonel Bouquet's opinion to bring or leave them. 

Your chimney at this place is finished. I shall take 
care to put up one at the next post. * 

I shall use every necessary precaution to get timely 
notice of the enemy's approach, so that I flatter myself 
you need be under no apprehensions on that head. A 
scouting party is just returned, and reports, that, five 
miles advanced, thay discovered the tracks of about 
forty persons making towards Kiskemanetas. The 
tracks appear to have been made to-day, or yesterday. 

I am, with very great respect, your most obedient,

SIR, 

I have the pleasure to inform you, that Fort Du-

possessed by his Majesty's troops on the 25th instant. 
The enemy, after letting us get within a day's march of

the place, burned the fort, and ran away by the light of 
it, at night, going down the Ohio by water, to the num- 
ber of about five hundred men, according to our best 
information. This possession of the fort has been mat- 
ter of surprise to the whole army, and we cannot attri- 
bute it to more probable causes, than the weakness of 
the enemy, want of provisions, and the defection of their 
Indians. Of these circumstances we were luckily in- 
formed by three prisoners, who providentially fell into 
our hands at Loyal Hanna, when we despaired of pro- 
ceeding further. A council of war had determined, that 
it was not advisable to advance this season beyond that 
place; but the above information caused us to march on 
without tents or baggage, and with only a light train of 
artillery. We have thus happily succeeded. It would 
be tedious, and I think unnecessary, to relate every 
trivial circumstance, that has happened since my last 
To do this, if needful, shall be the employment of a 
leisure hour, when I shall have the pleasure to pay my 
respects to your Honor. 

The General intends to wait here a few days to settle 
matters with the Indians, and then all the troops, except 
a sufficient garrison to secure the place, will march to 
their respective governments. I give your Honor this 
early notice, that your directions relative to the troops 
of Virginia may meet me on the road. I cannot help 
reminding you, in this place, of the hardships they have 
undergone, and of their present naked condition, that 
you may judge if it is not essential for them to have 
some little recess from fatigue, and time to provide 
themselves with necessaries. At present they- are desti- 
tute of every comfort of life. If I do not get your orders 
to the contrary, I shall march the troops under my com- 
mand directly to Winchester. They may then be dis- 
posed of, as you shall afterwards direct. 

VOL. IJ. 41 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 26, 

General Forbes desires me to inform you, that he is 
prevented, by a multiplicity of affairs, from writing to 
you so fully now, as he would otherwise have done. 
He has written to the commanding officers stationed on 
the communication from hence to Winchester, relative 
to the conduct of the Little Carpenter, a chief of the 
Cherokees, the purport of which was to desire, that 
they would escort him from one place to another, to 
prevent his doing any mischief to the inhabitants. 

This fortunate, and, indeed, unexpected success of 
our arms will be attended with happy effects. The 
Delawares are suing for peace, and I doubt not that 
other tribes on the Ohio will follow their example. A 
trade, free, open, and on equitable terms, is what they 
seem much to desire, and I do not know so effectual a 
way of riveting them to our interest, as by sending out 
goods immediately to this place for that purpose. It 
will, at the same time, be a means of supplying the gar- 
rision with such necessaries as may be wanted ; and, I 
think, the other colonies, which are as greatly interested 
in the support of this place as Virginia, should neglect 
no means in their power to establish and maintain a 
strong garrison here. Our business, without this pre- 
caution, will be but half finished ; while, on the other 
hand, we shall obtain a firm and lasting peace with the 
Indians, if this end is once accomplished. 

General Forbes is very assiduous in getting these 
matters settled upon a solid basis, and has great merit 
for the happy issue to which he has brought our affairs, 
infirm and worn down as he is.* At present I have 
nothing further to add, but the strongest assurances of 
my being your Honor's most obedient and most humble 
servant. 

* General Forbes died a few weeks afterwards in Philadelphia.

TO GOVERNOR FAUQUIER. 

Loyal Hanna, 2 December, 1758. 

SIR, 

The enclosed was written with the intention of send- 
ing it by the General's express, but his indisposition 
prevented that express from setting out for three days 
afterwards ; and the General thought, that my waiting 
upon your Honor would be more eligible, as I could re- 
present the situation of our affairs in this quarter more 
fully, than could well be done by letter. This I accord- 
ingly attempted ; but, upon trial, I found it impracticable 
to proceed with despatch, for want of horses, having 
now nearly two hundred miles to march before I can 
get a supply, and those at present in use being entirely 
disabled. I shall, notwithstanding, endeavour to comply 
with the General's request, but I cannot possibly be 
down till towards the 1st of next month^ and the bearer 
may arrive much sooner. 

The General has, in his letters, told you what gar- 
rison he proposed to leave at Fort Duquesne, but the 
want of provisions rendered it impossible to leave more 
than two hundred men in all ; and these, without great 
exertions, must, I fear, abandon the place or perish. 
To prevent, as far as possible, either of these events, I 
have by this conveyance written a circular letter to the 
back inhabitants of Virginia, setting forth the great ad- 
vantages of keeping that place, the improbability of do- 
ing it without their immediate assistance, that they may 
travel safely out while we hold that post, and that they 
will be allowed good prices for such provisions as they 
may carry. Unless the most effectual means shall be 
taken early in the spring to reinforce the garrison, the 
place will inevitably be lost, and then our frontiers will fall 
into the same distressed condition as heretofore. I can 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^T. 26. 

very confidently assert, that we never can secure them 
properly, if we again lose our footing on the Ohio, since 
we shall thereby lose the interest of the Indians. I there- 
fore think, that every necessary preparation should be 
made, and not a moment lost in adopting the most 
speedy and efficacious measures, for securing the ad- 
vantages to be derived from our holding possession of 
that important country. 

The preparatory steps should immediately be taken 
for preserving the communication from Virginia, by con- 
structing a post at Red-stone Creek, which w r ould 
greatly facilitate the supplying of our troops on the Ohio, 
where a formidable garrison should be sent, as soon as 
the season will admit. A trade with the Indians should 
be established upon such terms, and transacted by men 
of such principle, as would at the same time redound to 
the reciprocal advantage of the colony and the Indians, 
and effectually remove the bad impressions, which the In- 
dians have received from the conduct of a set of villains, 
divested of all faith and honor, and give us such an early 
opportunity of establishing an interest with them, as 
would ensure to us a large share of the fur-trade, not 
only of the Ohio Indians, but, in time, of the numerous 
nations possessing the back country westward. To 
prevent this advantageous commerce from suffering in 
its infancy, by the sinister views of designing, selfish 
men in the different provinces, I humbly conceive it ad- 
visable, that commissioners from each of the colonies 
should be appointed to regulate the mode of that trade, 
and fix it on such a basis, that all the attempts of one 
colony to undermine another, and thereby weaken and 
diminish the general system, might be frustrated. 

Although no one can entertain a higher sense of the 
great importance of maintaining a post on the Ohio than 
myself, yet, considering the present circumstances of 



PART I.] THE FRENCH WAR. 325 

my regiment, I would by no means have agreed to leave 
any part of it there, had not the General given an ex- 
press order. I endeavoured to show, that the King's 
troops ought to garrison it ; but he told me, that, as he 
had no instructions from the ministry relative to this 
point, he could not order it. Our men, left there, are in 
such a miserable condition, having hardly rags to cover 
their nakedness, and exposed to the inclemency of the 
weather in this rigorous season, that, unless provision is 
made by the country for supplying them immediately, 
they must perish. If the first Virginia regiment is to be 
kept up any longer, or any services are expected from 
it, the men should forthwith be clothed. By their pres- 
ent nakedness, the advanced season, and the inconceiv- 
able fatigues of an uncommonly long and laborious 
campaign, they are rendered totally incapable of any 
kind of service ; and sickness, death, and desertion 
must, if they are not speedily supplied, greatly reduce 
their numbers. To replace them with equally good 
men will, perhaps, be found impossible. 

With the highest respect, I am, &,c.

ment. It is needless, therefore, to recapitulate facts, or 
to trouble you further on this head. 

Reason, nay, common humanity itself points out, that 
some respite should be granted to troops returning from 
every toil and hardship, that cold, hunger, and fatigue 
can inflict, and I hope your sentiments correspond wit 
mine. 

If I easily get the better of my present disorder, I 
shall hope for the honor of seeing you about the 25th 
instant. The want of almost every necessary for the 
journey, and the want of my papers requisite to a full 
and final settlement with the country, oblige me to take 
my own house in the way down. 

Those matters, which your Honor has glanced at in 
your letters, have been fully communicated to me. 
That you had not the least share in causing them, I am 
equally well persuaded, and I shall think myself honored 
with your esteem; being, with the greatest respect,

TO GENERAL FORBES. 

Williamsburg, 30 December, 1758. 

SIR, 

As the Governor writes fully to you, respecting the 
posture of affairs here, and the present system of man- 
agement, I have little to add. I hoped a General As- 
sembly would be called immediately ; but the Council 
were of opinion, that, as they had met so lately, and 
were summoned to attend some time in February, it 
would be inconvenient to convene them sooner ; so that 
no measures for securing the communication between 
Fort Cumberland and Fort Duquesne, or, in short, any

thing else, can be effected, or even attempted, until that 
time. 

Captain M c Neil, who commanded the first Virginia 
regiment in my absence, committed an error, I am in- 
formed, at Raystown, in confining Mr. Hoops, the com- 
missary. I am not thoroughly acquainted with the 
particulars, but I believe, from the accounts received, 
that Mr. Hoops was equally culpable in detaining the 
provisions from half- starved men. This piece of rashness, 
I am told, is likely to bring M c Neil into trouble. I there- 
fore beg the favor of you, Sir, as I am well convinced 
M c Neil had nothing in view but the welfare of his men, 
to interpose your kind offices to settle the difference. 
This will be doing a favor to Captain M c Neil, as well as 
to myself. 

I should be extremely glad to hear of your safe arri- 
val at head-quarters, after a fatiguing campaign, and that 
a perfect return of health has contributed to crown your 
successes. I am, Sir, your most obedient and most 
humble servant.* 



* As Colonel Washington had determined at the beginning of the 
season to remain in the army no longer, than till the conclusion of this 
campaign, he resigned his commission immediately after his arrival in 
Williamsburg. On this occasion his officers presented to him an address, 
deeply expressive of their affection, their respect, and their ardent wishes 
for his future prosperity and welfare. See APPENDIX, No. V. 

He was married on the 6th of January, 1759, to Martha Custis, widow 
of Daniel Parke Custis, and daughter of John Dandridge. 

Being now a member of the House of Burgesses, he joined that Assem- 
bly when it was next convened. The House resolved to return their 
thanks to him, in a public manner, for the distinguished services, which he 
had rendered to his country, and this duty devolved on his friend the 
Speaker. Air. Wirt relates the anecdote in the following words, on the 
authority of Edmund Randolph. 

"As soon as Colonel Washington took his seat [in the Assembly], 
Mr. Robinson, in obedience to this order, and following the impulse of his 
own generous and grateful heart, discharged the duty with great dignity, 
but with such warmth of coloring, and strength of expression, as entirely 
to confound the young hero. lie rose to express his acknowledgments

I have many letters of yours in my possession unan- 
swered ; but at present this serves only to advise you of 
the above change, and at the same time to acquaint you, 
that I shall continue to make you the same consign- 
ments of tobacco as usual, and will endeavour to increase 
them in proportion as I find myself and the estate bene- 
fited thereby. 

The scarcity of the last year's crop, and the conse- 
quent high prices of tobacco, would, in any other case, 
have induced me to sell the estate's crop in this coun- 
try; but, for a present, and I hope small advantage only, 
I did not care to break the chain of correspondence, 
that has so long subsisted. 

On the other side is an invoice of some goods, which 
I beg you to send me by the first ship, bound either to 

for the honor ; but such was his trepidation and confusion, that he could not 
give distinct utterance to a syllable. He blushed, stammered, and trem- 
bled, for a second ; when the Speaker relieved him, by a stroke of address, 
that would have done honor to Louis the Fourteenth, in his proudest and 
happiest moment. ' Sit down, Mr. Washington,' said he, with a conciliat- 
ing smile, your modesty is equal to your valor, and that surpasses the 
power of any language that I possess.' " Life of Patrick Henry, p. 45.

want of them. Let them be insured, and, in case of 
accident, re-shipped without delay. Direct for me at

the name of my seat, the other of the river on which it

* The product of Washington's plantations was at this period almost 
exclusively tobacco. This he usually exported to London for a market, 
making the shipments in his own name, and putting the tobacco on board 
the vessels, which came up the river to his mansion at Mount Vernon, or 
to such other point as was most convenient. In those days, also, it was 
the practice of the Virginia planters to send to London for all the articles 
of common use. Twice a year Washington forwarded a list of such arti- 
cles to his agent, comprising not only all the necessaries and convenien- 
ces for household purposes, but likewise every article of wearing apparel 
for himself and each member of his family, specifying the names of each, 
and the ages of Mrs. Washington's two children, as also the size, descrip- 
tion, and quality of the articles. He then required his agent to send him, 
in addition to a general bill of the whole, the original voucher of each one 
of the persons from whom purchases were made. So minute and particular 
was he in these concerns, that for many years he entered with his own 
hand, in books prepared for the purpose, all the long lists of orders, and 
copies of the multifarious receipts from the different tradesmen, merchants, 
and mechanics in London, who had supplied the goods. In this way he 
kept a perfect oversight of the business, and could tell when any advan- 
tage was taken of him even in the smallest matter, of which he did not 
fail to remind his agent the next time he wrote. As the price obtained for 
his tobacco depended on the judgment, fidelity, and efforts of the agent in 
effecting sales, he would sometimes divide the agency, sending part to one 
person, and part to another, and, by comparing the results, he could detect 
any inattention or mismanagement, which had been unfavorable to his 
interest. 

The following extracts from letters, written in the year 3760, will afford 
hints of some of his habits. 

" By this conveyance you will receive invoices of such goods as are 
wanting, which please to send, as there directed, by Captain Johnston in 
the spring ; and let me beseech you to give the necessary directions for 
purchasing them upon the best terms. It is needless for me to particular- 
ize the sorts, qualities, or taste I would choose to have them in, unless it is 
observed ; and you may believe me when I tell you, that, instead of getting 
things good and fashionable in their several kinds, we often have articles 
sent us, that could only have been used by our forefathers in days of yore. 
It is a custom, I have some reason to believe, with many of the shopkeep- 
ers and tradesmen in London, when they know goods are bespoken for

330 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 27. 

TO ROBERT CARY, LONDON. 

Virginia, 12 June, 1759 

SIR, 

In a letter which I wrote you the 1st of last month, 
was enclosed an invoice of sundries, which I then was 
and still am much in need of. If those goods should 
not be shipped before this letter gets to hand, pray add 
to your purchase the things, which you will find on the 
other side, and send them as there directed. 

I shall find occasion to write you fully by the fleet, 
and shall enclose a list of sundries, that will be wanted 
for the estate's use. Till then I shall forbear to trou- 
ble you with particulars, as I shall expect also by that 
time to receive some account of the sales of the es- 
tate's tobacco sent you, and an account current. As 
this last is necessary for me to compare with my own 
account, in order to a satisfactory settlement with our 
General Court, I entreat you to be punctual in sending 
me one every spring and fall yearly. 

I shall keep the estate under the same direction as for- 
merly, neither altering the managers, the kind of tobacco, 
nor the manner of treating it, unless you advise otherwise 

exportation, to palm sometimes old and sometimes very slight and indiffer- 
ent ones upon us, taking care at the same time to advance ten, fifteen, or 
perhaps twenty per cent upon them." 

" And here I cannot forbear ushering in a complaint of the exorbitant 
prices of my goods this year. For many years I have imported goods 
from London, as well as other ports of Britain, and can truly say I 
never had such a pennyworth before. It would be a needless task to enu- 
merate every article that I have cause to except against. Let it suffice to 
say, that the woollens, linens, nails, &c., are mean in quality, but not in 
price, for in this they excel. Indeed they are far above any I ever had. 
It has always been a custom with me, when I make out my invoices, to 
estimate the charge of them. This I do for my own satisfaction, to know 
whether I am too fast or not, and I seldom vary much from the real prices ; 
but the amount of your invoice exceeds my calculation about twenty-five 
per cent, and many articles not sent that were ordered."

for our interest. And, while I continue to pursue this 
method, I hope you will be able to render such sales, as 
will not only justify the present consignments to you, 
but encourage my enlarging them ; for I shall be candid 
in telling you, that duty to the charge with which I am 
entrusted, as well as self-interest, will incline me to 
abide by those, who give the greatest proof of their abili- 
ties in selling my own and the estate's tobacco, and pur- 
chasing our goods, of which I can no otherwise judge, 
than by the accounts that will be rendered. And here 
permit me to ask, if it would be advisable to change the 
marks of any of the tobacco, or had I best ship it all 
under the usual marks ? If so, my part may be known 
by some small distinction, such as you can best advise. 

In my last, among other things, I desired you would 
send me, besides a small octavo volume, the best system 
now extant of agriculture. Since then, I have been told, 
that there is one, lately published, done by various hands, 
but chiefly collected from the papers of Mr. Hale. If 
this is known to be the best, pray send it, but not if any 
other is in higher esteem. I am, &c.

agreeable favor, covering an invoice of sundries, has 
come to hand, as have the goods also, in good order ;

can boast, great part of her cargo being damaged,

in point of health by his trip to England. The longing 
desire, which for many years I have had, of visiting the 
great metropolis of that kingdom, is not in the least 
abated by his prejudices, because I think the small share 
of health he enjoyed, while there, must have given a 
check to any pleasures he might anticipate, and would 
render any place irksome ; but I am now tied, and must 
set inclination aside. 

The scale of fortune in America is turned greatly in 
our favor, and success has become the companion of our 
fortunate generals. It \vould be folly in me to attempt 
particularizing their actions, since you receive accounts 
in a channel so much more direct than from hence.* 

I am now, I believe, fixed at this seat with an agreea- 
ble partner for life, and I hope to find more happiness in 
retirement, than I ever experienced amidst the wide and 
bustling world. I thank you heartily for your affection- 
ate wishes. Why will you not give me an occasion of 
congratulating you in the same manner 1 None would 
do it more cordially than, dear Sir, your most obedient 
and obliged servant. 



TO RICHARD WASHINGTON. 

Mount Vernon, 10 August, 1760. 

DEAR SIR, 

The French are so well drubbed, and seem so much 
humbled in America, that I apprehend our generals will 
find it no difficult matter to reduce Canada to our obe- 
dience this summer. But what may be Montgomery's 
fate in the Cherokee country I cannot so readily deter-

Niagara by Sir William Johnson, and Quebec had fallen in consequence

mine. It seems he has made a prosperous beginning, 
having penetrated into the heart of the country, and he 
is now advancing his troops in high health and spirits to 
the relief of Fort Loudoun. But let him be wary. He 
has a crafty, subtle enemy to deal with, that may give 
him most trouble when he least expects it.* We are 
in pain here for the king of Prussia, and wish Hanover 
safe, these being events in which we are much in- 
terested. 

My indulging myself in a trip to England depends 
upon so many contingencies, which, in all probability, 
may never occur, that I dare not even think of such a 
gratification. Nothing, however, is more ardently de- 
sired. But Mrs. Washington and myself would both 
think ourselves very happy in the opportunity of show- 
ing you the Virginia hospitality, which is the most agree- 
able entertainment we can give, or a stranger expect to 
find, in an infant, \voody country, like ours. 

I am, dear Sir, yours, &c. 



* Such proved in fact to be the fate of Colonel Montgomery. He 
marched from South Carolina with a party of regular troops and militia, and 
was at first successful in destroying several Indian towns, but fell at length 
into an ambuscade, where the Indians defeated him, with the loss of twenty 
of his men killed, and seventy-six wounded. He was obliged to retreat, 
and return to South Carolina, without making any farther progress. Fort 
Loudoun, situate on the borders of the Cherokee country, was reduced to 
the greatest extremity by hunger, and the garrison forced to capitulate 
to the Indians, who agreed to escort the officers and men in safety to 
another fort. They were, however, made the victims of treachery ; for the 
day after their departure a body of savages waylaid them, killed some, and 
captured the others, whom they took back to Fort Loudoun. Ramsay's

334 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T.2& 

TO CAPTAIN ROBERT MACKENZIE, AT VENANGO. 

Mount Vernon, 20 November, 1760. 

DEAR SIR, 

Had your favor of the 17th of August come to 
my hands before the 18th instant, I should not have 
given you the trouble of perusing my answer to it at 
this late season. I am sorry, that you should think it 
necessary to introduce a request to me, which is founded 
on reason and equity, with an apology. Had you claim- 
ed that as a right, which you seem to ask as a favor, I 
should have thought myself wanting in that justice, 
which is the distinguishing characteristic of an honest 
man, to have withheld it from you. 

But how to answer your purposes, and at the same 
time to avoid the imputation of impertinence, I am, I 
confess, more at a loss to determine. That General 
Amherst may have heard of such a person as I am, is 
probable, and this I dare venture to say is the chief 
knowledge he has of me. How then should I appear 
to him in an epistolary way ? And to sit down and 
write a certificate of your behaviour carries with it an 
air of formality, that seems more adapted to the case of 
a soldier than that of an officer. I must, therefore, beg 
the favor of you to make what use you please of this 
letter. 

For, Sir, with not more pleasure than truth, I can 
declare to you and the world, that while I had the honor 
of commanding the regiment, your conduct, both as an 
officer and a gentleman, was unexceptionable, and in 
every instance, as far as I was capable of discerning, 
such as to merit applause from better judges. Since 
my time, Colonel Byrd has been witness to your 
behaviour, and his letter recommendatory must, I am 
persuaded, do you more service than my sanguine en-

deavours. Although neither he, nor any other person, 
is more sensible of your worth, or more inclined to con- 
tribute his best offices to the completion of your wishes, 
than, Sir, your obedient servant. 



TO RICHARD WASHINGTON. 

Mount Vernon, 14 July, 1761. 

DEAR SIR, 

Since my last, I have had the pleasure of receiving 
your obliging favors of the 16th of October and 1st 
of January. A mixture of bad health and indolence 
has kept me, till this time, from paying that due respect 
to your letters, which they merited at my hands ; and 
now, having nothing *to relate that could in any wise 
claim your attention, I was still inclined to a further 
delay. 

The entire conquest of Canada, and of the French 
in most parts of North America, being a story too stale 
to relate in these days, we are often at a loss for some- 
thing with which to fill our letters. True it is, the 
Cherokee nation, by a perfidious conduct, has caused 
Colonel Grant to be sent once more into their country 
with an armed force ; but I believe supplies from the 
French on Mobile River come in so slowly, that they are 
more sincerely disposed to peace now than ever they 
were before. This pacific turn may be caused in some 
measure, too, by another regiment in the pay of this 
colony, which is ordered to penetrate into their country 
by a different passage. But it is generally thought, that 
their submission will put a stop to any further progress 
of our arms.* 

* Colonel Grant had an engagement with the Cherokees, near the place 
of Colonel Montgomery's ambuscade, which lasted for several hours, but

We have received the account of the reduction of 
Belle Isle, and we hear of another fleet destined for

which most engrosses our attention at this time, is the 
congress at Augsburg, as I believe nothing is more sin- 
cerely desired in this part of tne world, than an honora- 
ble peace. I am, &c. 



TO RICHARD WASHINGTON. 

Mount Vernon, 20 October, 1761. 

DEAR SIR, 

Since my last, of the 14th of July, I have in appear- 
ance been very near my last breath. My indisposition 
increased upon me, and I fell into a very low and dan- 
gerous state. I once thought the grim king would 
certainly master my utmost efforts, and that I must sink, 
in spite of a resolute struggle ; but, thank God, I have 
now got the better of the disorder, and shall soon be re- 
stored, I hope, to perfect health again. 

I do not know, that I can muster up one tittle of news 
to communicate. In short, the occurrences of this part 
of the world are at present scarce worth reciting ; for, 
as we live in a state of peaceful tranquility ourselves, so 
we are at very little trouble to inquire after the opera- 
tions against the Cherokees, who are the only people 
that disturb the repose of this great continent, and who, 
I believe, would gladly accommodate differences upon 
almost any terms ; not, I conceive, from any apprehen- 

the Indians were repulsed. He then destroyed all the villages and pro- 
visions, that came in his way, and took post for some time in Fort Prince 
George. Here the Cherokees, through their Chief, Attakullakulla, sued 
for peace, which was conceded to them, and which continued till the break- 
ing out of the revolutionary war. 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 337 

sions they are under, on account of our arms, but be- 
cause they want the supplies, with which we and we 
only can furnish them. We catch the reports of peace 
with gaping mouths, and every person seems anxious 
for a confirmation of that desirable event, provided it 
comes, as no doubt it will, upon honorable terms. 

On the other side is an invoice of clothes, which I 
beg the favor of you to purchase for me, and to send 
them by the first ship bound to this river. As they are 
designed for wearing- apparel for myself, I have commit- 
ted the choice of them to your fancy, having the best 
opinion of your taste. I want neither lace nor embroid- 
ery. Plain clothes, with gold or silver buttons, if worn 
in genteel dress, are all that I desire. I have hitherto 
had my clothes made by one Charles Lawrence. 
Whether it be the fault of the tailor, or of the measure 
sent, I cannot say, but, certain it is, my clothes have 
never fitted me well. I therefore leave the choice of 
the workman to you. I enclose a measure, and, for a 
further direction, I think it not amiss to add, that my 
stature is six feet ; otherwise rather slender than cor- 
pulent. I am very sincerely, dear Sir, your most affec- 
tionate humble servant.

Williamsburg, 3 November, 1761. 

SIR, 

I came to this place last night, and find, that the ar- 
ticles mentioned in the enclosed invoice are wanted for 
the plantations on York River. Please to send them as 
there directed. 

We have little or no news. Our Assembly is at 
present convened to grant supplies for carrying on the

war against the Cherokee Indians, should they choose 
to continue it ; but this I am persuaded they are by no 
means inclined to do, nor are they prepared for it, as 
they have been soliciting peace for some time past. I 
wish the powers of Europe were as well disposed to an 
accommodation as these poor wretches. A stop would 
then soon be put to the effusion of blood, and peace 
and plenty would resume their empire again, to the joy 
and content, I believe, of most ranks and degrees of 
people. I am, &,c. 



TO ROBERT STEWART. 

Williamsburg, 2 May, 1763. 

DEAR STEWART, 

With some difficulty I have at last procured the en- 
closed, which you will please to make use of as occasion 
may require. I was upon the point of forwarding these, 
and my letters to London, when Colonel Hunter arrived, 
and informed me that he left you at New York, and 
that your embarkation for England seemed to be a mat- 
ter of doubt. I have, therefore, changed the route of 
these letters, now sending them to New York, to the 
care of Mr. Beverley Robinson. 

Signing the definitive treaty seems to be the only 
piece of news, which prevails here at present, and dif- 
fuses general joy. Our Assembly is suddenly called, in 
consequence of a memorial of the British merchants to 
the Board of Trade, representing the evil consequences 
of our paper emission, and their Lordships' report and 
orders thereupon, which, I suppose, will set the whole 
country in flames. This stir of the merchants seems to 
be ill-timed, and cannot be attended with any good ef- 
fects, but, I fear, the contrary. However, on the 19th 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 339 

instant the Assembly will meet; and till then I will sus- 
pend my further opinion of the matter. 

I am, with the most unalterable regard, your most 
affectionate friend and servant. 



TO ROBERT STEWART. 

Mount Fernon, 13 August, 1763. 

MY DEAR STEWART, 

By Captain Walter Stewart I am favored with an op- 
portunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of 
the 6th of June, and at the same time of forwarding the 
copy of my former one, which was in readiness before 
that came to hand, and which I incline to send, notwith- 
standing the original has reached you, because it con- 
tains the second bills, arid other matters entire as they 
ought to have been sent, and as I dare say Mr. Stewart 
will be so good as to deliver them. 

Another tempest has arisen upon our frontiers, and 
the alarm spread wider than ever. In short, the inhab- 
itants are so apprehensive of danger, that no families 
remain above the Conococheague road, and many are 
gone below it. Their harvests are in a manner lost, and 
the distresses of the settlement are evident and mani- 
fold. In Augusta many people have been killed, and 
numbers fled. Confusion and despair prevail in every 
quarter. At this instant a calm is taking place, which 
forebodes some mischief to Colonel Bouquet. At least 
those, who wish well to the convoy, are apprehensive 
for him ; since it is not unlikely, that the retreat of all 
the Indian parties at one and the same time from our 
frontiers, is a proof of their assembling a force some-

where, and for some particular purpose, and none more 
likely than to oppose his march.* 

It was expected, that our Assembly would have been 
called, in such exigences as these ; but it is concluded, 
as I have been informed, that an Assembly without 
money would be no eligible plan. To comprehend the 
meaning of this expression you must know, that the 
Board of Trade, at the instance of the British mer- 
chants, have undertaken to rebuke us in the most ample 
manner for our paper emissions ; and therefore the Gov- 
ernor and Council have directed one thousand militia to 
be employed for the protection of the frontiers, five 
hundred of whom are to be drafted from Hampshire 
and other counties, and to be under the command 
of Colonel Stephen, whose military courage and capa- 
city, says the Governor, are well established. The 
other five hundred, from the southern frontier counties, 
are to be conducted by Major Lewis ; so that you may 
readily conceive what an enormous expense must at- 
tend these measures. Stephen, immediately upon the 
Indians' retiring, advanced to Fort Cumberland with two 

* The Shawanees, Delawares, and other Ohio tribes of Indians, had 
made a general and almost simultaneous attack upon all the remote fron- 
tier settlements and posts. They had committed many murders, and taken 
the forts at Le Bceuf, Venango, Presqu'Isle, and others on Lake Michi- 
gan, the Miami River, the Wahash, at Sandusky, and Michilimackinac. 
Fort Pitt (formerly Duquesne) was in imminent danger of falling into their 
hands. In July, Colonel Bouquet was despatched by General Amherst 
with five hundred men and a supply of military stores for the relief of that 
fort. He marched through Pennsylvania, following the same route, that 
had been pursued by General Forbes's army. The Indians, who were 
then besieging Fort Pitt, heard of his march, and came out to meet him. 
They attacked his army on the 5th of August, in a defile near the head 
waters of Turtle Creek, and the contest was kept up during the whole day, 
with considerable loss on both sides. Colonel Bouquet maintained his 
ground through the night, and the next day routed the Indians, and 
marched without further molestation to Fort Pitt. The news of this ac- 
tion seems not to have reached Washington, when he wrote the above 
letter.

hundred or two hundred and fifty militia, and will doubt- 
less achieve some signal advantage, of which the public 
will soon be informed. 

I think I have now communicated the only news, 
which these parts afford. It is of a melancholy na- 
ture, indeed, and we cannot tell how or when the af- 
fair will end. I hope you may have got matters settled 
to your liking before this time. I should rejoice to hear 
it, as I should at every thing that gives you pleasure or 
profit. 

Mrs. Washington makes a tender of her compliments, 
and you may be assured that I am, with great sincerity, 
dear Sir, your most obedient and affectionate servant. 



TO ROBERT CARY. 

Mount Vernon, 13 February, 1764. 

SIR, 

The enclosed is a copy of my last. We have been 
curiously entertained, of late, with the description of an 
engine lately constructed, I believe, in Switzerland, and 
which has undergone some improvements in England, 
for taking up trees by the roots. It is related, that trees 
of a considerable diameter are forced up by this engine ; 
that six hands, in working one of them, will raise two or 
three hundred trees in the space of a day ; and that an 
acre of ground may be eased of the trees, and laid fit 
for ploughing, in the same time. How far these asser- 
tions have been realized by repeated experiment, it is 
impossible for me at this distance to determine ; but, if 
the accounts are not greatly exaggerated, such powerful 
assistance must be of vast utility in many parts of this 
woody country, where it is impossible for our force (and 
laborers are not to be hired here), between the finishing

of one crop and the preparation for another, to clear 
ground fast enough to afford the proper changes, eithei 
in the planting or farming business. 

The chief purport of this letter, therefore, is to beg 
fhe favor of you to make minute inquiries into the trials, 
that have been made by order of the Society, and, ii 
they have proved satisfactory, to send me one of thes< 
engines by the first ship bound to the Potomac Rivei 
If they are made of different sizes, I should prefer on< 
of a middle size, capable of raising a tree of fifteen or 
eighteen inches diameter. The cost I am a stranger to. 
Fifteen, twenty, and twenty -five guineas have been 
mentioned ; but the price, were it double these sums, I 
should totally disregard, provided the engine is capable 
of performing what is related of it, and not of that com- 
plicated nature, which would cause it to be easily dis- 
ordered, and rendered unfit for use, but constructed 
upon so plain, simple, and durable a plan, that the com- 
mon artificers of this country may be able to repair it, if 
any accidents should happen. Should you send me 
one, be so good as to let me have with it the most am- 
ple directions for its use, together with a model of its 
manner of operating. I am, &,c. 



TO FRANCIS DANDRIDGE, LONDON. 

Mount Vernon, 20 September, 1765. 

SIR, 

You will permit me, after six years' silence (the time 
I have been married to your niece), to pay my respects 
to you in this epistolary way. I shall think myself 
happy in beginning a correspondence, which cannot but 
be attended with pleasure on my side. 



PART I.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 343 

I should hardly have taken the liberty, Sir, of intro- 
ducing myself to your acquaintance in this manner, had 
not a letter from Mr. Robert Gary given me reasons to 
believe, that such an advance on my part would not be 
altogether disagreeable to you. If I could flatter my- 
self, that you would in anywise be entertained with the 
few occurrences, that it may be in my power to relate, 
I should endeavour to atone for my past remissness, in 
this respect, by future punctuality. 

At present there are few things among us, that can 
be interesting to you. The Stamp Act, imposed on the 
colonies by the Parliament of Great Britain, engrosses 
the conversation of the speculative part of the colonists, 
who look upon this unconstitutional method of taxation, 
as a direful attack upon their liberties, and loudly ex- 
claim against the violation. What may be the result of 
this, and of some other (I think I may add ill-judged) 
measures, I will not undertake to determine ; but this I 
may venture to affirm, that the advantage accruing to 
the mother country will fall greatly short of the expec- 
tations of the ministry ; for certain it is, that our whole 
substance already in a manner flows to Great Britain, 
and that whatsoever contributes to lessen our importa- 
tions must be hurtful to her manufacturers. The eyes 
of our people already begin to be opened ; and they will 
perceive, that many luxuries, for which we lavish our 
substance in Great Britain, can well be dispensed with, 
whilst the necessaries of life are mostly to be had within 
ourselves. This, consequently, will introduce frugality, 
and be a necessary incitement to industry. If Great 
Britain, therefore, loads her manufactures with heavy 
taxes, will it not facilitate such results ? They will not 
compel us, I think, to give our money for their exports, 
whether we will or not ; and I am certain, that none of

consideration. Where, then, is the utility of these re- 
strictions 1 

As to the Stamp Act, regarded in a single view, one 
and the first bad consequence attending it, is, that our 
courts of judicature must inevitably be shut up ; for it is 
impossible, or next to impossible, under our present cir- 
cumstances, that the act of Parliament can be complied 
with, were we ever so willing to enforce its execution. 
And, not to say (which alone would be sufficient) that 
we have not money to pay for the stamps, there are 
many other cogent reasons, which prove that it would 
be ineffectual. If a stop be put to our judicial proceed- 
ings, I fancy the merchants of Great Britain, trading to 
the colonies, will not be among the last to wish for a re- 
peal of the act. 

I live on the Potomac River in Fairfax county, about 
ten miles below Alexandria, and many miles distant 
from any of my wife's relations, who all reside upon 
York River, and whom we seldom see more than once 
a year, and not always so often. My wife, who is very 
well, and Master and Miss Custis, children of her former 
marriage, all join in making a tender of their duty and 
best respects to yourself and your lady. My compli- 
ments to her, also, I beg may be made acceptable, and 
that you will do me the justice to believe that I am, dear 
Sir, your most obedient humble servant. 






TO CAPEL HAJVBURY, LONDON. 

Mount Vernon, 25 July, 1767. 

SIR, 

Unseasonable as it may be, to take any notice of the 
repeal of the Stamp Act at this time, yet I cannot help 
observing, that a contrary measure would have intro-

duced very unhappy consequences. Those, therefore, 
who wisely foresaw such an event, and were instru- 
mental in procuring the repeal of the act, are, in my 
opinion, deservedly entitled to the thanks of the well- 
wishers to Britain and her colonies, and must reflect 
with pleasure, that, through their means, many scenes 
of confusion and distress have been prevented. Mine 
they accordingly have, and always shall have, for their 
opposition to any act of oppression ; and that act could 
be looked upon in no other light by every person, who 
would view it in its proper colors. 

I could wish it were in my power to congratulate 
you on the success of having the commercial system of 
these colonies put upon a more enlarged and extensive 
footing, than it is ; because I am well satisfied, that it 
would ultimately redound to the advantage of the mother 
country, so long as the colonies pursue trade and agri- 
culture, and would be an effectual let to manufacturing 
among them. The money, which they raise, would 
centre in Great Britain, as certainly as the needle will 
settle to the pole. I am, &c.* 

* In writing to another correspondent in England, some months before, 
he expressed himself on this subject as follows. 

" The repeal of the Stamp Act, to whatever cause owing, ought much 
to be rejoiced at ; for had the Parliament of Great Britain resolved upon 
enforcing it, the consequences, I conceive, would have been more direful 
than is generally apprehended, both to the mother country and her colo- 
nies. All, therefore, who were instrumental in procuring the repeal, are 
entitled to the thanks of every British subject, and have mine cordially."

TO WILLIAM CRAWFORD.* 



Mount Vernon, 21 September, 1767. 

DEAR SIR, 

From a sudden hint of your brother's, I wrote to you 
a few days ago in a hurry. Having since had more 
time for reflection, I now write deliberately, and with 
greater precision, on the subject of my last letter. 

I then desired the favor of you (as I understood rights 
might now be had for the lands, which have fallen within 
the Pennsylvania line,) to look me out a tract of about 
fifteen hundred, two thousand, or more acres some- 
where in your neighbourhood, meaning only by this, 
that it may be as contiguous to your own settlement, as 
such a body of good land can be found. It will be easy 
for you to conceive, that ordinary or even middling 
lands would never answer my purpose or expectation, 
so far from navigation, and under such a load of ex- 
penses, as these lands are encumbered with. No; a 
tract to please me must be rich, of which no person can 
be a better judge than yourself, and, if possible, level. 
Could such a piece of land be found, you would do me 
a singular favor in falling upon some method of securing 
it immediately from the attempts of others, as nothing is 
more certain, than that the lands cannot remain long un- 



* Mr. Crawford had been a captain in General Forbes's campaign, and 
was now settled on Youghiogany River. He was afterwards a colonel in 
the Revolutionary war, and served on the frontiers. In the summer of 
1782, he commanded an expedition into the Ohio country against the In- 
dians, where, after a hard fought battle, he was taken prisoner, and tor- 
tured to death in a most cruel and shocking manner. He had approved 
himself an officer of merit, judicious, intrepid, and possessing much 
skill in Indian warfare. In May, 1778, he took command of the regiment 
at Pittsburg. General Washington, in writing at that time to the Board of 
War, said, "I know him to be a brave and active officer, and of consid- 
erable influence upon the western frontier of Virginia." 




PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 347 

granted, when once it is known, that rights are to be 
had. 

The mode of proceeding I am at a loss to point out 
to you ; but, as your own lands are under the same cir- 
cumstances, self-interest will naturally lead you to an 
inquiry. I am told, that the land or surveyor's office is 
kept at Carlisle. If so, I am of opinion that Colonel 
Armstrong, an acquaintance of mine, has something to 
do in the direction of it, and I am persuaded he would 
readily serve me. I will write to him by the first op- 
portunity on that subject, that the way may be prepared 
for your application to him, if you find it necessary. 
For your trouble and expense you may depend on be- 
ing repaid. It is possible, but I do not know that it 
really is the case, that the custom in Pennsylvania will 
not admit so large a quantity of land, as I require, to be 
entered together; if so, this may perhaps be arranged 
by making several entries to the same amount, if the 
expense of doing it is not too heavy. This I only drop 
as a hint, leaving the whole to your discretion and good 
management. If the land can only be secured from 
others, it is all I want at present. The surveying I 
would choose to postpone, at least till the spring, when, 
if you can give me any satisfactory account of this mat- 
ter, and of what I am next going to propose, I expect to 
pay you a visit about the last of April. 

I offered in my last to join you, in attempting to se- 
cure some of the most valuable lands in the King's part, 
which I think may be accomplished after a while, not- 
withstanding the proclamation, that restrains it at pres- 
ent, and prohibits the settling of them at all ; for I can 
never look upon that proclamation in any other light 
(but this I say between ourselves), than as a temporary 
expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians. It must 
fall, of course, in a few years, especially when those In- 



348 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [MT. 35. 

dians consent to our occupying the lands.* Any person, 
therefore, who neglects the present opportunity of hunt- 
ing out good lands, and in some measure marking and 
distinguishing them for his own, in order to keep others 
from settling them, will never regain it. If you will be 
at the trouble of seeking out the lands, I will take upon 
me the part of securing them, as soon as there is a pos- 
sibility of doing it, and will moreover be at all the cost 
and charges of surveying and patenting the same. You 
shall then have such a reasonable proportion of the 
whole, as we may fix upon at our first meeting ; as I 
shall find it necessary, for the better furthering of the 
design, to let some of my friends be concerned in the 
scheme, who must also partake of the advantages. 

By this time it may be easy for you to discover, that 
my plan is to secure a good deal of land. You will con- 
sequently come in for a very handsome quantity ; and as 

*. The above alludes to the King's proclamation in 1763, which prohibited 
all governors from granting warrants for lands to the westward of the 
sources of the rivers, whic"h run into the Atlantic ocean, and forbade all per- 
sons purchasing such lands, or settling on them, without special license 
from the King first obtained. The proclamation seems never to have been 
heeded in this sense by the governors, who continued to grant warrants 
for lands known to be within the charter limits of their respective colonies, 
although beyond the head-waters of such streams. Washington's idea, 
as expressed in this letter, was, that the restriction would soon be taken off 
in regard to the territory beyond the charter boundaries, and then the per- 
sons, who were best acquainted with the lands, would have a good oppor- 
tunity of making the most favorable selections and purchases. 

Similar views seem to have been generally entertained. .Chancellor 
Livingston, in a letter to Dr. Franklin, respecting the conditions of peace, 
previous to the treaty of 1782, says ; " Virginia, even after the Procla- 
mation of 1763, patented considerable tracts on the Ohio, far beyond the 
Appalachian mountains. It is true, the several governments were prohib- 
ited at different times from granting lands beyond certain limits ; but these 
were clearly temporary restrictions, which the policy of maintaining a 
good understanding with the natives dictated, and were always broken 
through after a short period, as is evinced by the grants above mentioned, 
made subsequent to the proclamation of 1763." Diplomatic Correspon- 
dence of the American Revolution, Vol. III. p. 270. 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 349 

you will obtain it without any costs, or expenses, I hope 
you will be encouraged to begin the search in time. I 
would choose, if it were practicable, to get large tracts 
together ; and it might be desirable to have them as near 
your settlement, or Fort Pitt, as they can be obtained 
of good quality, but not to neglect others at a greater 
distance, if fine bodies of it lie in one place. It may be 
worthy of your inquiry, to find out how the Maryland 
back line will run, and what is said about laying off 
Neale's grant. I will inquire particularly concerning the 
Ohio Company, that we may know what to apprehend 
from them.* For my own part, I should have no objec- 
tion to a grant of land upon the Ohio, a good way below 
Pittsburg, but would first willingly secure some valuable 
tracts nearer at hand. 

I recommend, that you keep this whole matter a se- 
cret, or trust it only to those, in whom you can confide, 
and who can assist you in bringing it to bear by their 
discoveries of land. This advice proceeds from several 
very good reasons, and, in the first place, because I 
might be censured for the opinion I have given in re- 
spect to the King's proclamation, and then, if the scheme 
I am now proposing to you were known, it might give 
the alarm to others, and, by putting them upon a plan 
of the same nature, before we could lay a proper foun- 
dation for success ourselves, set the different interests 
clashing, and, probably, in the end, overturn the whole. 
All this may be avoided by a silent management, and 
the operation carried on by you under the guise of hunt- 
ing game, which you may, I presume, effectually do, at 
the same time you are in pursuit of land. When this is 
fully discovered, advise me of it, and if there appears 
but a possibility of succeeding at any time hence, I will

TO WILLIAM RAMSAY. 

Mount Vernon, 29 January, 1769. 

DEAR SIR, 

Having once or twice of late heard you speak highly 
of the New Jersey College, as if you had a desire of 
sending your son William there (who, I am told, is a 
youth fond of study and instruction, and disposed to a 
studious life, in following which he may not only pro- 
mote his own happiness, but the future welfare of others), 
I should be glad, if you have no other objection to it 
than the expense, if you would send him to that college, 
as soon as convenient, and depend on me for twenty- 
five pounds a year for his support, so long as it may be 
necessary for the completion of his education. If I live 
to see the accomplishment of this term, the sum here 
stipulated shall be annually paid ; and if I die in the 
mean time, this letter shall be obligatory upon my heirs, 
or executors, to do it according to the true intent and 
meaning hereof. 

No other return is expected, or wished, for this offer, 
than that you will accept it with the same freedom and 
good will, with which it is made, and that you may not 
even consider it in the light of an obligation, or mention 
it as such ; for, be assured, that from me it will never 
be known. I am, &,c. 




PART PRIVATE LETTERS. 351 



TO GEORGE MASON.* 



Mount Vernon, 5 April, 1769. 

DEAR SIR, 

Herewith you will receive a letter and sundry pa- 
pers, f which were forwarded to me a day or two ago 
by Dr. Ross of Bladensburg. I transmit them with the 
greater pleasure, as my own desire of knowing your 
sentiments upon a matter of this importance exactly co- 
incides with the Doctor's inclinations. 

At a time, when our lordly masters in Great Britain will 
be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of 
American freedom, it seems highly necessary that some- 
thing should be done to avert the stroke, and maintain 
the liberty, which we have derived from our ancestors. 
But the manner of doing it, to answer the purpose ef- 
fectually, is the point in question. 

That no man should scruple, or hesitate a moment, to 
use arms in defence of so valuable a blessing, is clearly 
my opinion. Yet arms, I would beg leave to add, 
should be the last resource, the dernier resort. We 
have already, it is said, proved the inefficacy of ad- 
dresses to the throne, and remonstrances to Parliament. 
How far, then, their attention to our rights and privileges 
is to be awakened or alarmed, by starving their trade 
and manufactures, remains to be tried. ' 

The northern colonies, it appears, are endeavouring to

adopt this scheme. In my opinion it is a good one, and 
must be attended with salutary effects, provided it can 
be carried pretty generally into execution. But to what 
extent it is practicable to do so, I will not take upon me 
to determine. That there will be a difficulty attending 
the execution of it every where, from clashing interests, 
and selfish, designing men, ever attentive to their own 
gain, and watchful of every turn, that can assist their lu- 
crative views, cannot be denied; and in the tobacco 
colonies, where the trade is so diffused, and in a manner 
wholly conducted by factors for their principals at home 
[in England], these difficulties are certainly enhanced, 
but I think not insurmountably increased, if the gentle- 
men in their several counties will be at some. pains to 
explain matters to the people, and stimulate them to 
cordial agreements to purchase none but certain enu- 
merated articles out of any of the stores after a definite 
period, and neither import nor purchase any themselves. 
This, if it should not effectually withdraw the factors 
from their importations, would at least make them ex- 
tremely cautious in doing it, as the prohibited goods 
could be vended to none but the non-associators, or 
those who would pay no regard to their association ; 
both of whom ought to be stigmatized, and made the 
objects of public reproach. 

The more I consider a scheme of this sort, the more 
ardently I wish success to it, because I think there are 
private as well as public advantages to result from it, 
the former certain, however precarious the other may 
prove. In respect to the latter, I have always thought, 
that by virtue of the same power, which assumes the 
right of taxation, the Parliament may attempt at least to 
restrain our manufactures, especially those of a public 
nature, the same equity and justice prevailing in the one 
case as the other, it being no greater hardship to forbid 



PART I.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 353 

my manufacturing, than it is to order me to buy goods 
loaded with duties, for the express purpose of raising a 
revenue. But as a measure of this sort would be an 
additional exertion of arbitrary power, we cannot be 
placed in a worse condition, I think, by putting it to the 
test. 

On the other hand, that the colonies are considerably 
indebted to Great Britain, is a truth universally ac- 
knowledged. That many families are reduced almost, 
if not quite, to penury and want by the low ebb of their 
fortunes, and that estates are daily selling for the dis- 
charge of debts, the public papers furnish too many 
melancholy proofs. That a scheme of this sort will 
contribute more effectually than any other that can be 
devised to extricate the country from the distress it at 
present labors under, I most firmly believe, if it can be 
generally adopted. And I can see but one class of 
people, the merchants excepted, w r ho will not, or ought 
not, to wish well to the scheme, namely, they who live 
genteelly and hospitably on clear estates. Such as these, 
were they not to consider the valuable object in view, 
and the good of others, might think it hard to be cur- 
tailed in their living and enjoyments. As to the penuri- 
ous man, he would thereby save his money and his 
credit, having the best plea for doing that, which before, 
perhaps, he had the most violent struggles to refrain 
from doing. The extravagant and expensive man has 
the same good plea to retrench his expenses. He 
would be furnished with a pretext to live within bounds, 
and embrace it. Prudence dictated economy before, 
but his resolution was too weak to put it in practice ; 
" For how can I," says he, " who have lived in such and 
such a manner, change my method ? I am ashamed to 
do it, and, besides, such an alteration .in the system of 
my living will create suspicions of the decay of my

354 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mv. 37. 

fortune, and such a thought the world must not harbour." 
He continues his course, till at last his estate comes to 
an end, a sale of it being the consequence of his per- 
severance in error. This I am satisfied is the way, 
that many, who have set out in the wrong track, have 
reasoned, till ruin has stared them in the face. And in 
respect to the needy man, he is only left in the same 
situation that he was found in, better, I may say, be- 
cause, as he judges from comparison, his condition is 
amended in proportion as it approaches nearer to those 
above him. 

Upon the whole, therefore, I think the scheme a good 
one, and that it ought to be tried here, with such altera- 
tions as our circumstances render absolutely necessary. 
But in what manner to begin the work, is a matter 
worthy of consideration. Whether it can be attempted 
with propriety or efficacy, further than a communication 
of sentiments to one another, before May, when the 
Court and Assembly will meet at Williamsburg, and a 
uniform plan can be concerted, and sent into the differ- 
ent counties to operate at the same time and in the 
same manner everywhere, is a thing upon which I am 
somewhat in doubt, and I should be glad to know your 
opinion.* I am, &c. 



* The following is an extract from Mr. Mason's reply to this letter, 
dated the same day. 

" I entirely agree with you, that no regular plan of the sort proposed 
can be entered into here, before the meeting of the General Court at least. 
if not of the Assembly. In the mean time it may be necessary to publish 
something preparatory to it in our gazettes, to warn the people of the im- 
pending danger, and induce them the more readily and cheerfully to con- 
cur in the proper measures to avert it ; and something of this sort I had 
begun, but am unluckily stopped by a disorder, which affects my head and 
eyes. As soon as I am able, I shall resume it, and then write you more 
fully, or endeavour to see you. In the mean time pray commit to writing

TO LORD BOTETOURT, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Mount Vernon, 15 April, 1770. 

MY LORD, 

Being fully persuaded of your Excellency's inclina- 
tion to render every just and reasonable service to the 
people you govern, or to any body or society of them, 
that shall ask it, and being encouraged in a more particu- 

when set in competition with our liberty, ought to be rejected, not with 
reluctance, but with pleasure. Yet it is plain, that in the tobacco colonies 
we cannot at present confine our importations within such narrow bounds, 
as the northern colonies. A plan of this kind, to be practicable, must be 
adapted to our circumstances ; for if not steadily executed, it had better 
have remained unattempted. We may retrench all manner of superfluities, 
finery of all descriptions, and confine ourselves to linens, woollens, &c. 
not exceeding a certain price. It is amazing how much this practice, if 
adopted in all the colonies, would lessen the American imports, and dis- 
tress the various traders and manufacturers in Great Britain. 

" This would awaken their attention. They would see, they would feel, 
the oppressions we groan under, and exert themselves to procure us re- 
dress. This once obtained, we should no longer discontinue our importa- 
tions, confining ourselves still not to import any article, that should here- 
after be taxed by act of Parliament for raising a revenue in America ; for, 
however singular I may be in my opinion, I am thoroughly convinced, that, 
justice and harmony happily restored, it is not the interest of these colonies 
to refuse British manufactures. Our supplying our mother country with 
gross materials, and taking her manufactures in return, is the true chain 
of connexion between us. These are the bands, which, if not broken by 
oppression, must long hold us together, by maintaining a constant recipro- 
cation of interest. Proper caution should, therefore, be used in drawing 
up the proposed plan of association. It may not be amiss to let the minis- 
try understand, that, until we obtain a redress of grievances, we will with- 
hold from them our commodities, and particularly refrain from making 
tobacco, by which the revenue would lose fifty times more than all their 
oppressions could raise here. 

" Had the hint, which I have given with regard to taxation of goods im- 
ported into America, been thought of by our merchants before the repeal 
of the Stamp Act, the late American revenue acts would probably never 
have been attempted." 

The Assembly in May was the first that met after the arrival of Lord 
Botetourt as Governor. The Burgesses had been together but a few days, 
when they passed a series of very strong resolves respecting the rights 



356 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 38. 

lar manner by a letter, which I have just received from 
Mr. Blair, clerk of the Council, to believe, that your 
Lordship is desirous of being fully informed how far the 
grant of land solicited by Mr. Walpole and others will 
affect the interest of this country in general, or individu- 
als in particular, I shall take the liberty (as I am pretty 
intimately acquainted with the situation of the frontiers 
of this dominion) to inform your Lordship, that the 
bounds of that grant, if obtained upon the extensive plan 

of the colonies. The Governor took the alarm, and immediately dissolved 
the Assembly. As soon as the Burgesses left the public hall, they all met 
again at a private house in Williamsburg (May 18th, 1769), appointed a 
moderator, and assented unanimously to a non-importation agreement, 
otherwise called an Association, consisting of a preamble and eight re- 
solves. It was signed by every member present, and sent throughout the 
country for the signatures of the people. Washington was a member of 
the Assembly at that time. 

The Association is printed at large in Burk's History of Virginia, Vol. 
III. p. 345. On comparing it with Mr. Mason's manuscript draft, retained by 
Washington, I find it precisely the same, except the addition of two short 
articles, and the omission of another. The following article, contained in 
Mr. Mason's draft, was left out by the Burgesses. 

" If the measures already entered into should prove ineffectual, and our 
grievances and oppressions should notwithstanding be continued, then, 
and in that case, the subscribers will put a stop to their exports to Europe 
of tar, pitch, turpentine, timber, lumber, and skins and furs of all sorts, and 
will endeavour to find some other employment for their slaves and other 
hands than cultivating tobacco, which they will entirely leave off making, 
and will enter into such regulations, as may be necessary with regard to the 
rents and other tobacco debts." 

As Mr. Mason was not then a member of the House of Burgesses, and 
as Washington left home for Williamsburg shortly after receiving the 
draft, he must have taken it with him to the Assembly, and of course have 
been a principal agent in procuring its adoption. 

He wrote afterwards as follows to his correspondent in London, on 
sending out his customary orders; "You will perceive, in looking over 
the several invoices, that some of the goods there required, are upon con- 
dition, that the act of Parliament imposing a duty on tea, paper, &c. for 
the purpose of raising a revenue in America, is totally repealed ; and I 
beg the favor of you to be governed strictly thereby, as it will not be in 
my power to receive any articles contrary to our non-importation agree- 
ment, which I have subscribed, and shall religiously adhere to, and should, 
if it were, as I could wish it to be, ten times as strict."

proposed, will comprehend at least four fifths of the 
land, for the purchase and survey of which this govern- 
ment has lately voted two thousand five hundred pounds 
sterling. It must, therefore, destroy the well grounded 
hopes of those, (if no reservation is made in their favor,) 
who have had the strongest assurances, that the govern- 
ment could give, of enjoying a certain portion of the 
lands, which have cost this country so much blood and 
treasure to secure. 

By the extracts, which your Excellency did me the 
honor to enclose, I perceive, that the petitioners propose 
to begin opposite to the mouth of the Scioto River, 
which is at least seventy or seventy-five miles below the 
Great Kenhawa, and more than three hundred from 
Pittsburg, and to extend from thence in a southwardly 
direction through the pass of the Ouasioto Mountain, 
which, by Evans's map, and the best accounts I have 
been able to get from persons, who have explored that 
country, will bring them near the latitude of North 
Carolina. Thence they proceed northeastwardly to the 
Kenhawa, at the junction of New River and Green 
Briar, upon both of which waters we have many settlers 
upon lands actually patented. From that point they go 
up the Green Briar to the head of its northeasterly 
branch, thence easterly to the Allegany Mountains, 
thence along these mountains to the line of Lord Fair- 
fax, and thence with his line, and the lines of Maryland 
and Pennsylvania, till the west boundary of the latter 
intersects the Ohio, and finally down that river to the 
place of beginning.* 

These, my Lord, are the bounds of a grant prayed 
for, and which, if obtained, will give a fatal blow, in my 
humble opinion, to the interests of this country. But

these are my sentiments as a member of the community 
at large. I now beg leave to offer myself to your 
Excellency's notice, in a more interested point of view, 
as an individual, 'and as a person, who considers himself 
in some degree the representative of the officers and 
soldiers, who claim a right to two hundred thousand 
acres of this very land, under a solemn act of govern- 
ment, adopted at a period very important and critical to 
his Majesty's affairs in this part of the world. I shall, 
therefore, rely on your Lordship's accustomed goodness 
and candor, w r hilst I add a few words in support of the 
equity of our pretensions, although, in truth, I have very 
little to say on this subject now, which I have not here- 
tofore taken the liberty of observing to your Excellency. 
The first letter I ever did myself the honor of writing 
to you, on the subject of this land, and to which I beg 
leave to refer, contained a kind of historical account of 
our claim ; but as there requires nothing more to eluci- 
date a right, than to offer a candid exhibition of the 
case, supported by facts, I shall beg leave to refer your 
Lordship to an order of Council, of the 18th of February, 
1754, and to Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, which 
issued in consequence of that order, both of which are 
enclosed. I will next add, that these troops not only 
enlisted agreeably to the proclamation, but behaved so 
much to the satisfaction of the country, as to be honored 
with the most public acknowledgments of it by the As- 
sembly. Would it not be hard, then, my Lord, to de- 
prive men under these circumstances, or their represen- 
tatives, of the just reward of their toils ? Was not this 
act of the Governor and Council offered to the soldiers, 
and accepted by them, as an absolute compact ? And 
though the exigency of affairs, or the policy of govern- 
ment, made it necessary to continue these lands in a 
dormant state for some time, ought not their claim to be

considered, in preference to all others ? When the 
causes cease, we fain would hope so. We flatter our- 
selves, that it will also appear to your Lordship in this 
point of view, and that, by your kind interposition, and 
favorable representation of the case, his Majesty will be 
graciously pleased to confirm this land to us, agreeably 
to a petition presented to your Excellency in Council on 
the 15th of last December; with this difference only, 
that, instead of Sandy Creek (one of the places allotted 
for the location of our grant, and which we now certain- 
ly know will not be comprehended within the ministerial 
line, as it is called), we may be allowed to lay a part of 
our grant between the west boundary of Pennsylvania 
and the river Ohio, which will be expressly agreeable to 
the words of Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, inas- 
much as it is contiguous to the Fork of the Monongahela. 
This favor, my Lord, would be conferring a singular ob- 
ligation on soldiers, most of whom, either in their per- 
sons or fortunes, have suffered in the cause of their 
country ; and it cannot fail to receive the thanks of a 
grateful body of men, but of none more warmly than of 
your Lordship's most obedient and humble servant. 



TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Mount Vernon, 15 June, 1771. 

MY LORD, 

The very obliging offer your Lordship was pleased to 
make, the day I left Williamsburg, in behalf of the 
officers and soldiers, who, under the faith of govern- 
ment, lay claim to two hundred thousand acres of land, 
on the waters of the Ohio, promised them by proclama- 
mation in 1754, I did not embrace, because it is evident 
to me, who am in some degree acquainted with the 



360 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. \&T. 39 

situation of that country, and the rapid progress now 
making in the settlement of it, that delay at this time in 
the prosecution of our plan would amount to the loss of 
the land, inasmuch as emigrants are daily and hourly 
settling on the choice spots, and waiting a favorable 
opportunity to solicit legal titles, on the ground of pre- 
occupancy, when the office shall be opened. I therefore 
hoped, and the officers and soldiers, who have suffered 
in the cause of their country, still hope, that, although 
your Lordship was of opinion you could not at that time 
vest them with an absolute and bond fide grant of the 
land, yet that you will permit them to take such steps, 
at their own expense and risk, as others do, to secure 
their lands agreeably to proclamation, especially as their 
claim is prior to any other, and better founded, they 
having a solemn act of government and the general 
voice of the country in their favor. 

This is the light, my Lord, in which the matter ap- 
peared to me, and in this light it is also considered by 
the officers with whom I have lately had a meeting. 
The report gains ground, that a large tract of country 
on the Ohio, including every foot of land to the west- 
ward of the Allegany Mountains, is granted to a com- 
pany of gentlemen in England, to be formed into a 
separate government. If this report is really well found- 
ed, there can be no doubt of your Lordship's having 
the earliest and most authentic accounts of it, since it 
so essentially interferes with the interests and expecta- 
tions of this country. 

To request the favor of your Lordship to inform me 
whether this report be true, and, if true, whether any 
attention has been or probably will be paid to the order 
of Council and proclamation of 1754, may be presump- 
tuous ; but, as the officers and soldiers confide in me to 
transact this business for them, and as it would be a real 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 361 

advantage to them to know the truth of this report, and 
how it is likely to affect them, there needs no other 
apology for my taking the liberty of addressing to you 
this request, in the hope that your Lordship will conde- 
scend to do me the honor of writing a line on the sub- 
ject by the next post to Alexandria, which will be 
acknowledged as a peculiar obligation conferred on, 
my Lord, your Lordship's most obedient servant. 



TO THE REVEREND JONATHAN BOUCHER.* 

Mount Vernon, 9 July, 1771. 

DEAR SIR, 

From several concurring causes, which exist at this 
moment, at the eve of my departure for Williamsburg, 
I have both my head and hands too full of business to 
allow me time to write more than a hasty letter. This, 
however, I shall attempt to do, in answer to yours of the 
4th instant. 

In my last I informed you, that the friends (I do not 
by this confine myself to the relations only) of Mr. Cus- 
tis were divided in opinion, as to the propriety of his 
travelling, not because they thought advantages would 
not result from it, but on account of the expense, as he 
would commence his tour with the heavy charge, which 
you thought requisite to induce you to accompany him, 
and which would at once anticipate half his income. 
His estate is of that kind, which rather comes under the 
denomination of a large than a profitable one. This di- 

* Mr. Boucher was an Episcopal clergyman residing in Annapolis. He 
was tutor to John Parke Custis, the son of Mrs. Washington by her former 
marriage. Mr. Boucher went to England when the Revolution broke out, 
and never returned. He published a volume of sermons, which he had 
preached in America, and some other writings. 

VOL. II. 46 EE 



362 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 39. 

vided opinion was a sufficient cause, I observed in my 
last, for me to be circumspect in my conduct, as I am 
accountable to another tribunal, besides that in my own 
breast, for the part I am to act on this occasion. You 
cannot but know, that every farthing, expended in be- 
half of this young gentleman, must undergo the inspec- 
tion of the General Court, in their examination of my 
guardianship accounts, and that it would be imprudent 
in me to permit him to launch into any uncommon or 
extravagant course, especially at a time when a heavy 
and expensive chancery suit is instituted against his es- 
tate, without first knowing whether such a charge would 
be approved by those, who have a constitutional right to 
judge of the expediency or propriety of the measure. 

These are the reasons why I said in my last letter, 
that my own inclinations were still as strong as ever for 
Mr. Custis's pursuing his travelling scheme, provided 
the Court should approve of the expense, and provided, 
also, that it should appear, when his judgment was a 
little more matured, that he was desirous of undertaking 
this tour upon a plan of improvement, rather than a 
vague desire of gratifying an idle curiosity, or spending 
his money. If his mother does not speak her own sen- 
timents, rather than his, he is lukewarm in the scheme ; 
and I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that his edu- 
cation, from what I have understood of his improvement, 
however advanced it may be for a youth of his age, is 
by no means ripe enough for a travelling tour. Not 
that I think his becoming a mere scholar is a desirable 
education for a gentleman, but I conceive a knowledge 
of books is the basis upon which other knowledge is to 
be built, and in travelling he is to become acquainted 
with men and things rather than books. At present, 
however well versed he may be in the principles of the 
Latin language (which is not to be wondered at, as he 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 363 

began the study of it as soon as he could speak), he is 
unacquainted with several of the classical authors, that 
might be useful to him. He is ignorant of Greek, the 
advantages of learning which I do not pretend to judge 
of, and he knows nothing of French, which is absolutely 
necessary to him as a traveller. He has little or no ac- 
quaintance with arithmetic, and is totally ignorant of the 
mathematics, than which, at least so much of them as 
relates to surveying, nothing can be more essentially 
necessary to any man possessed of a large landed es- 
tate, the bounds of some part or other of which are 
always in controversy. 

Now, whether he has time between this and next 
spring to acquire a sufficient knowledge of these studies, 
or so much of them as is requisite, I leave you to judge ; 
as also whether a boy of seventeen years old, which will 
be his age next November, can have any just notions of 
the end and design of travelling. I have already given 
it as my opinion, that it would be precipitating this 
event, unless he were to go immediately to the univer- 
sity for a couple of years, in which case he could see 
nothing of America ; which might be a disadvantage to 
him, as it is to be expected that every man, who travels 
with a view of observing the laws and customs of other 
countries, should be able to give some description of the 
situation and government of his own. 

Upon the whole, it is impossible for me at this time to 
give a more decisive answer, however strongly inclined 
I may be to put you upon a certainty in this affair, than 
I have done ; and I should think myself wanting in can- 
dor, if I concealed any circumstance from you, which 
leads me to fear, that there is a possibility, if not a prob- 
ability, that the whole design may be totally defeated. 
Before I ever thought myself at liberty to encourage 
this plan, I judged it highly reasonable and necessary, 



364 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 39. 

that his mother should be consulted. I laid your first 
letter and proposals before her, and desired that she 
would reflect well, before she resolved, as an unsteady 
behaviour might be a disadvantage to you. Her deter- 
mination was, that, if it appeared to be his inclination to 
undertake this tour, and it should be judged for his ben- 
efit, she would not oppose it, whatever pangs it might 
give her to part with him. To this declaration she still 
adheres, but in so faint a manner, that I think, with her 
fears and his indifference, it will soon be declared he 
has no inclination to go. I do not say that this will be 
the case. I cannot speak positively ; but as this is the 
result of my own reflections upon the matter, I thought 
it but fair to communicate it to you. 

Several causes, I believe, have concurred to make 
her view his departure, as the time approaches, with 
more reluctance than she expected. The unhappy sit- 
uation of her daughter has in some degree fixed her 
eyes upon him as her only hope. To what I have al- 
ready said, I can only add, that my warmest wishes are 
to see him prosecute a plan, at a proper period, which I 
may be sure will redound to his advantage, and that 
nothing shall be wanting on my part to aid and assist 
him. In the event of his going, I should think myself 
highly favored, and him much honored, by Governor 
Eden's letters of introduction. Such letters, with others 
that might be procured, could not fail of having their 
advantages. 

You will please to make my compliments to Mr. Du- 
lany, and assure him, that I have not the vestige of a 
house at the Frederic Springs, otherwise it should have 
been, if unengaged, much at his service. The two sea- 
sons I spent there I occupied a house of Mr. Mercer's. 

I am, &c. 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 365 

TO GEORGE MERCER, LONDON. 

Williamsburg, 7 November, 1771. 

DEAR SIR, 

Since you first left this country, I have been favored 
with two letters from you ; one of them serving to enter 
your own, and the claims of Captains Stobo and Van- 
braam, to part of the two hundred thousand acres of 
land, granted under Governor Dinwiddie's proclama- 
tion ; and the other, of the 18th of December, which did 
not come to my hands till about the first of last month, 
urging the expediency of prosecuting our right to those 
lands with spirit. 

In respect to the first, I have only to inform you, that 
your own claim, as well that for your brother as yourself, 
was entered before the receipt of your letter, and that 
Stobo's and Vanbraam's are also entered. In answer 
to the second, I can only add, that the same backward- 
ness, which has ever appeared in our Honorable Board 
to recognise our right to these lands, seems still to pre- 
vail, and that our business in this affair is by no means 
in that forwardness, which I could wish, owing, I believe 
I may say, to other causes, as well as to a lukewarmness 
in those from whom we seek redress. The unequal 
interest and dispersed situation of the claimants make a 
regular cooperation difficult. An undertaking of this 
kind cannot be conducted without a good deal of ex- 
pense and trouble ; and the doubt of obtaining the lands, 
after the utmost efforts, is such, as to discourage the 
larger part of the claimants from lending assistance, 
whilst a few are obliged to wade through every diffi- 
culty, or relinquish every hope. 

In this state of things, and in behalf of those, who had 
contributed to the expense of exploring and surveying 
the lands, I petitioned the Governor and Council, that 



EE* 



366 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^T. 39. 

the amount of each man's share, according to his rank, 
should be ascertained, and each claimant suffered to de- 
signate and survey his portion separately, by which means 
every man would stand upon his own footing. This 
petition I thought so reasonable, and so consistent with 
every principle of common justice, to say nothing of the 
disadvantage of being forced into large tracts, and the 
manifest inconvenience of dividing them afterwards, that 
I conceived it could not possibly be rejected ; but to my 
great astonishment it was so, and we are now compelled 
to be at the expense of surveying our whole quantity in 
twenty surveys, and then each individual subjected to 
the charge of surveying his own separately. In this 
way we are doubly taxed, while the whole is held as a 
kind of joint interest, and no man knows his property, 
or can tell how or in what manner to dispose of it. In 
short, so many glaring obstacles opposed their mode of 
proceeding, that they did not even attempt to remove 
them, but contented themselves with putting the sol- 
diers upon a worse footing, than the meanest individual 
in the community, rather than be thought to give a li- 
cense for the pillaging of his Majesty's or the Proprie- 
tary lands, when it is a fact well known, and every age 
evinces it, that no country ever was or ever will be 
settled without some indulgence. What inducements 
have men to explore uninhabited wilds, but the prospect 
of getting good lands ? Would any man waste his time, 
expose his fortune, nay, life, in such a search, if he was 
to share the good' and the bad with those that come 
after him 1 Surely not. We have surveyed ten of the 
largest tracts we can find in the district allowed us, and 
have been able to get sixty thousand acres, and for this 
tract we have been obliged to go between two and 
three hundred miles below Fort Pitt, as the lands there- 
abouts are thought to be within the Pennsylvania gov- 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 367 

ernment ; at least, they are surveyed under those rights, 
and held by such a number of individuals, that it was 
thought to be impolitic to engage in private disputes, 
whilst there appeared a gloomy prospect of getting any 
land at all. 

The claims, which have been presented to me, are 
now all given in, and the Governor and Council have 
determined, that each officer shall share according to the 
rank in which he entered the service, and that the land 
shall be distributed in the following manner, namely, 
to each field-officer fifteen thousand acres, to each 
captain nine thousand, to each subaltern six thousand, to 
the cadets two thousand five hundred each, six hundred 
to a sergeant, five hundred to a corporal, and four hun- 
dred to each private soldier. They have made a re- 
serve of thirty thousand acres, as well to provide for any 
claims, which may hereafter come in, as to compensate 
those, who have been and must necessarily continue to 
be saddled with the expense, which we find will not be 
very inconsiderable, as we have already expended near 
two hundred pounds, and the surveyor not yet paid. * 

* The Major in the expedition had been accused of cowardice at the 
affair of the Great Meadows, and his name was omitted in the vote of 
thanks to the officers by the legislature. It was- decided, however, that 
this person should have his share of the land, and the following extract 
from a letter to him on this subject will show with what spirit and tone 
Washington could retort upon rudeness, when there was occasion. 

SIR, 

" Your impertinent letter was delivered to me yesterday. As I am not 
accustomed to receive such from any man, nor would have taken the same 
language from you personally, without letting you feel some marks of my 
resentment, I would advise you to be cautious in writing me a second of 
the same tenor. But for your stupidity and sottishness you might have 
known, by attending to the public gazette, that you had your full quantity 
of ten thousand acres of land allowed you, that is, nine thousand and sev- 
enty-three acres in the great tract, and the remainder in the small tract. 

" But suppose you had really fallen short, do you think your superlative 
merit entitles you to greater indulgence than others ? Or, if it did, that I 



. 

368 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 39. 

This expense must now be greatly augmented, as we 
shall be exposed to a considerable charge in exploring 
the lands, before we can proceed to survey any more. 
From every thing we know at present, it appears im- 
possible to get two hundred thousand acres in twenty 
surveys, without including mountains and inhospitable 
hills to the amount of near one half, which will render 
the grant of little value, and be the source of much dis- 
content at a division. It behooves us, therefore, to ex- 
amine the lands well before we survey. And allow me 
to add, that it will be very proper for you to give 
Messrs. Stobo and Vanbraam a hint, that something 
more than entering their claims is necessary. I dare 
say they will hardly think it reasonable to profit by the 
labor and purse of others. It is highly incumbent on 
them, therefore, to appoint an agent in this country to 
transact their business and advance their proportion of 
the expense, if they expect to share in the lands. 

To give you a minute detail of the proceedings, re- 
specting this grant, would be a work of time, and afford 
you little entertainment. What I have here said will 
serve as a general outline, and that is all J have aimed 
at in this letter. I should not have delayed answering 
your first letter till this time, had you not mentioned 
your intention of embarking soon on your return. This 

was to make it good to'you, when it was at the option of the Governor 
and Council to allow but five hundred acres in the whole, if they had been 
so inclined? If either of these should happen to be your opinion, I am very 
well convinced, that you will be singular in it ; and all my concern is, that 
I ever engaged in behalf of so ungrateful a fellow as you are. But you 
may still be in need of my assistance, as I can inform you, that your af- 
fairs, in respect to these lands, do not stand upon so solid a basis as you 
may imagine, and this you may take by way of hint. 

" I wrote to you a few days ago concerning the other distribution, pro- 
posing an easy method of dividing our lands ; but since I find in what tem- 
per you are, I am sorry I took the trouble of mentioning the land or your 
name in a letter, as I do not think you merit the least assistance from me."

account having been frequently corroborated by your 
brother, of whom I often inquired after you, I thought a 
letter could have little chance of finding you in England. 
I have just been told by Mr. Mercer, that you are to 
remain in London for some advices from him, respecting 
the affairs of the Ohio Company.* Mrs. Washington 
makes a tender of her compliments to you, and I am r 
with very sincere regard, dear Sir, your most obedient

TO WILLIAM EDWARDS, GOVERNOR OF WEST FLORIDA. 

Virginia, 25 March, 1773. 

SIR, 

Mr. Wood, the bearer of this, is a gentleman of Vir- 
ginia, going upon a tour to Florida. He proposes, 
before his return, to explore some of the ungranted 
lands in your government ; and, as I have never yet 
been able to designate the lands to which I am em titled 
under his Majesty's proclamation of October, 1763, 
he has promised, if he meets with such lands as he 
thinks will answer my purpose, to have ten thousand 
acres surveyed for me. To five thousand acres I am 
entitled in my own right, by virtue of that proclamation j 
to the residue by purchase, certificates of which will be 
presented to your Excellency by Mr. Wood, under the 
hand and seal of Lord Dunmore, our present governor, i 

* See APPENDIX, No. VI. 

f By this proclamation, three new colonies were established in Amieri 
ca, namely, Quebec, or Canada, East Florida, and West Florida. Lands 
were also granted to the officers and soldiers, who had served in the late 
war, and who resided in America, on their personal application for the 
same, in the following quantities and proportions. To every field-officer five 
thousand acres, to every captain three thousand, to every subaltern or staff- 
ofiiccr two thousand, to every non-commissioned officer two liiuidr&d, and 

VOL. ii. 47 



370 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [jE-r. 41. 

My entire ignorance of the climate and soil, the ad- 
vantages and disadvantages, of the country of West 
Florida, is the reason why his Lordship's certificates are 
couched in such general terms ; and of my giving Mr. 
Wood a discretionary power to select the lands, or not, 
as he may be influenced by these appearances. Should 
he meet with a spot favorable to my wishes, I have no 
doubt of your Excellency's granting the land, with such 
indulgences as have been practised in similar cases, 
agreeably to his Majesty's gracious intention, with the 
terms of which I shall endeavour strictly to comply. 

Could I, Sir, a stranger, take it upon me with pro- 
priety to recommend Mr. Wood, I should briefly add, 
that he is a gentleman well esteemed in Virginia, and I 
am persuaded will duly appreciate any little civilities 
you may be pleased to bestow on him. I have the 
honor to be, Sir, with very great respect, &,c. 



TO BENEDICT CALVERT. 

Mount Vernon, 3 April, 1773. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am now set dow r n to write to you on a subject of 
importance, and of no small embarrassment to me. My 
son-in-law and ward, Mr. Custis, has, as I have been 
informed, paid his addresses to your second daughter, 
and, having made some progress in her affections, has 
solicited her in marriage. How far a union of this sort 
may be agreeable to you, you best can tell ; but I should 
think myself wanting in candor, were I not to confess, 
that Miss Nelly's amiable qualities are acknowledg- 

to every private fifty, and all to be free of quitrents for ten years. The 
lands could be chosen, however, only in one of the above three new 
colonies. 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 371 

ed on all hands, and that an alliance with your family 
will be pleasing to his. 

This acknowledgment being made, you must permit me 
to add, Sir, that at this, or in any short time, his youth, 
inexperience, and unripened education, are, and will be, 
insuperable obstacles, in my opinion, to the completion of 
the marriage. As his guardian, I conceive it my indis- 
pensable duty to endeavour to carry him through a 
regular course of education (many branches of which, I 
am sorry to add, he is totally deficient in), and to guard 
his youth to a more advanced age before an event, on 
which his own peace and the happiness of another are 
to depend, takes place. Not that I have any doubt of 
the warmth of his affections, nor, I hope I may add, any 
fears of a change in them ; but at present I do not con- 
ceive that he is capable of bestowing that attention 
to the important consequences of the married state, which 
is necessary to be given by those, who are about to enter 
into it, and of course I am unwilling he should do it till 
he is. If the affection, which they have avowed for 
each other, is fixed upon a solid basis, it will receive no 
diminution in the course of two or three years, in which 
time he may prosecute his studies, and thereby render 
himself more deserving of the lady and useful to society. 
If, unfortunately, as they are both young, there should be 
an abatement of affection on either side, or both, it had 
better precede than follow marriage. 

Delivering my sentiments thus freely will not, I hope, 
lead you into a belief, that I am desirous of breaking off 
the match. To postpone it is all I have in view ; for I 
shall recommend to the young gentleman, with the 
warmth that becomes a man of honor, (notwithstanding 
he did not vouchsafe to consult either his mother or me 
on the occasion,) to consider himself as much engaged 
to your daughter, as if the indissoluble knot were tied ; 



372 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [M-r. 41. 

and, as the surest means of effecting this, to apply 
himself closely to his studies, (and in this advice 
I flatter myself you will join me,) by which he will, 
in a great measure, avoid those little flirtations with 
other young ladies, that may, by dividing the attention, 
contribute not a little to divide the affection. 

It may be expected of me, perhaps, to say something 
of property ; but, to descend to particulars, at this time, 
must seem rather premature. In general, therefore, I 
shall inform you, that Mr. Custis's estate consists of 
about fifteen thousand acres of land, a good part of it 
adjoining the city of Williamsburg, and none of it 
forty miles from that place ; several lots in the said 
city ; between two and three hundred negroes ; and 
about eight or ten thousand pounds upon bond, and in 
the hands of his merchants. This estate he now holds 
independent of his mother's dower, which will be an 
addition to it at her death ; and, upon the whole, it ^s 
such an estate as you will readily acknowledge ought to 
entitle him to a handsome portion with a wife. But as 
I should never require a child of my own to make a 
sacrifice of himself to interest, so neither do I think it 
incumbent on me to recommend it as a guardian. 

At all times when you, Mrs. Calvert, or the young 
ladies, can make it convenient to favor us with a visit, 
we should be. happy in seeing you at this place. Mrs. 
Washington and Miss Custis join me in respectful com- 
pliments, and 

I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Mount Vernon, 13 April, 1773. 

MY LORD, 

In obedience to your Lordship's request, I do myself 
the honor to inform you, that, by letters this day receiv- 
ed from Dr. Cooper of King's College in New York, I 
find it will be about the first of next month before I 
shall set off for that place, and that it will perhaps be 
the middle of June before I return. Harvest then com- 
ing on, and seldom ending till after the middle of July, 
I could almost wish to see it accomplished ; but if the 
delay in doing it is attended with any kind of inconven- 
ience to your Lordship, I will, at all events, be ready by 
the first of July to accompany you through any and 
every part of the western country, which you may 
think proper to visit. 

I beg the favor of your Lordship to inform me, 
therefore, as nearly as you can, of the precise time you 
will do me the honor of calling here, that I may get 
ready accordingly, and give notice of it to Mr. Craw- 
ford (if your Lordship purposes to take the route of 
Pittsburg), whom I took the liberty of recommending as 
a good woods-man, and well acquainted with the lands 
in that quarter, that he may be disengaged when we 
get to his house, which is directly on that communica- 
tion. I am persuaded, that such a person will be found 
very necessary in an excursion of this sort, from his 
superior knowledge of the country, and of the inhabi- 
tants, who are thinly scattered over it. 

No person can be better acquainted with the equi- 
page and simple conveniences necessary in an under- 
taking of this sort, than your Lordship, and, therefore, 
it would be impertinent in me to mention them ; but if 
your Lordship should find it convenient to have any

thing provided in this part of the country, and will 
please to honor me with your commands, they shall be 
punctually obeyed. As, also, if your Lordship chooses 
to have an Indian engaged, I will write to Colonel 
Croghan, Deputy Indian Agent, who lives near Pitts- 
burg, to have one provided. 

The design of my journey to New York is to take 
my son-in-law, Mr. Custis, to King's College. If your 
Lordship, therefore, has any letters or commands, either 
to that place or Philadelphia, I shall think myself honor- 
ed in being the bearer of them, as well as benefited 
by means of the introduction. 

I am, with the greatest respect, your Lordship's most 
obedient and most humble servant. 



TO THE REVEREND DR. COOPER, PRESIDENT OF 
KING'S COLLEGE, NEW YORK. 

New York, 31 May, 1773. 

REVEREND SIR, 

Enclosed you have a set of bills for one hundred 
pounds sterling, which please to set at the prevailing- 
exchange, and retain the money in your own hands to 
answer Mr. Custis's expenses at college, and such calls 
as he may have for cash to defray the incident expenses 
of his abode in this city. 

In respect to the first article of charge, I submit the 
matter wholly to your better judgment, under a firm 
belief of your adopting such measures, as will most con- 
tribute to promote the principal end of Mr. Custis's 
coming here, not regarding the extra charge incurred in 
the accomplishment of it. In regard to the second, 
as I do not know what sum he ought, with propriety, to 
expend in such a place as New York, I shall not under-

take to determine it ; but hope, if, contrary to my ex- 
pectation, you should find him inclined to run into any 
kind of extravagance, you will be so good, by your 
friendly admonition, as to check its progress. 

As Mr. Custis may probably want clothing and other 
necessaries, you will please to establish a credit in his 
behalf with such merchants as you can recommend ; and 
when the deposit now lodged with you is expended in 
this and other payments, be so good as to transmit me 
a copy of the disbursements, and I shall furnish you 
with other bills whereby to lay in a new fund. 

I have nothing further to add at present, except that 
at the next vacation, or at any other time, I shall think 
myself very happy in seeing you in Virginia, and that I 
am, with very great respect and esteem, your most obe- 
dient humble servant. 



TO WILLIAM CRAWFORD. 

Mount Vernon, 25 September, 1773. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have heard, (the truth of which, if you saw Lord 
Dunmore in his way to or from Pittsburg you possibly 
are better acquainted with than I am,) that his Lordship 
will grant patents for lands lying below the Scioto, to 
the officers and soldiers, who claim under the proclama- 
tion of October, 1763. If so, I think no time should be 
lost in having them surveyed, lest some new revolution 
should happen in our political system. I have, there- 
fore, by this conveyance, written to Captain Bullitt, 
to desire he will have ten thousand acres surveyed for 
me ; five thousand of which I am entitled to in my own 
right, the other five thousand by purchase from a cap- 
tain and lieutenant. 



376 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^T. 41. 

I have desired him to get this quantity of land in one 
tract, if to be had of the first quality ; if not, then in two, 
or even in three, agreeably to the several rights under 
which I hold, rather than survey bad land for me, or 
even that which is middling. I have also desired him 
to get it as near the mouth of the Scioto, that is, to the 
western bounds of the new colony * as may be ; but for 
the sake of' better lands, I would go quite down to the 
Falls, or even below, meaning thereby to get richer 
and wider bottoms, as it is my desire to have my lands 
run out upon the banks of the Ohio. If you should go 
down the river this fall, in order to look out your own 
quantity under the proclamation, I shall be much obliged 
to you for your assistance to Captain Bullitt, in getting 
these ten thousand acres for me, of the most valuable 
land you can, and I will endeavour to make you ample 
amends for your trouble ; but I by no means wish or 
desire you to go down on my account, unless you find 
it expedient on your own. Of this I have written to 
Captain Bullitt, under cover to you, desiring, if you 
should be with him, that he will ask your assistance. 

As I have understood that Captain Thompson (by 
what authority I know not) has been surveying a good 
deal of land for the Pennsylvania officers, and that Dr. 
Connolly has a promise from our Governor of two thou- 
sand acres at the Falls, I have desired Captain Bullitt 
by no means to involve me in disputes with any person, 
who has an equal claim to land with myself, under the 
proclamation of 1763. As to the pretensions of other 
people, it is not very essential ; as I am told that the 
Governor has declared he will grant patents to none but 
the officers and soldiers, who are comprehended within 



* This new colony was " Walpole's Grant," mentioned above in the 
lotter to Lord Botetourt, April 15th, 1770. 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 377 

the proclamation aforementioned ; but even of these 
claims, if I could get lands equally as good, as conve- 
nient, and as valuable in every respect, elsewhere, I 
should choose to steer clear. 

Old David Wilper, who was an officer in our regi- 
ment, and has been with Bullitt running out land for 
himself and others, tells me, that they have already 
discovered four salt springs in that country, three oi 
which Captain Thompson has included within some sur- 
veys he has made ; and the other, an exceedingly valua- 
ble one, upon the River Kentucky, is in some kind of dis- 
pute. I wish I could establish one of my surveys there ; 
I would immediately turn it to an extensive public bene- 
fit, as well as private advantage. However, as four are 
already discovered, it is more than probable there are 
many others, and if you could come at the knowledge 
of them by means of the Indians, or otherwise, I would 
join you in taking them up in the name or names of 
some persons, who have a right under the proclamation, 
and whose right we can be sure of buying, as it seems 
there is no other method of having lands granted ; 
but this should be done with a good deal of circum- 
spection and caution, till patents are obtained. 

I did not choose to forego the opportunity of writing 
to you by the gentlemen, who are going to divide their 
land at the mouth of the great Kenhawa, though I could 
wish to have delayed it till I could hear from the Gov- 
ernor, to whom I have written, to know certainly wheth- 
er he will grant patents for the land which Captain Bul- 
litt is surveying, that one may proceed with safety ; as 
also whether a discretionary power, which I had given 
Mr. Wood to select my land in West Florida, under an 
information, even from his Lordship himself, that lands 
could not be had here, would be any bar to my survey- 
ing on the Ohio ; especially as I have heard since 

VOL. II. 48 FF*

Mr. Wood's departure, that all the lands on that part of 
the Mississippi, to which he was restricted by me, are 
already engaged by the emigrants, who have resorted 
to that country. Should I, however, receive any dis- 
couraging account from his Lordship on these heads, I 
shall embrace the first opportunity that offers afterwards 
to acquaint you with it. 

By Mr. Leet I informed you of the unhappy cause, 
which prevented my going out this fall. But I hope 
nothing will prevent my seeing you in that country in 
the spring.* The precise time, as yet, it is not in my 
power to fix ; but I should be glad if you would let me 
know how soon it may be attended with safety, ease, 
and comfort, after which I will fix upon a time to be at 
your house. 

I am in the mean while, with sincere good wishes for 
you, Mrs. Crawford, and family, your friend, &c.

DEAR SIR, 

" I last post received yours of the 12th instant, wherein you beg to be 
informed whether I propose granting patents on the Ohio to such officers 
and soldiers, as claim under his Majesty's proclamation in October, 1763.

service of this colony, I take the liberty of addressing 
your Excellency on the subject of the lands, which the 
gentlemen conceive themselves entitled to under his 
Majesty's bounty of October, 1763. 

The exception in favor of the officers and soldiers, 
contained in his Majesty's order in Council, of the 6th 
of April last, they humbly conceive is so strong an im- 
plication of your Lordship's right to grant them these 
lands, as to remove every restraint you were under be- 
fore ; and as there are no waste lands to be had in this 
colony, but such as lie upon the western waters, they 
humbly pray for leave to survey on the river Ohio, and 
its waters, below the mouth of Scioto (the western 
boundary of the new colony, should it ever take place), 
apprehending that your Excellency has an undoubted 
right to grant patents for these lands, since they have 
ever been considered as appertaining to Virginia, war- 
ranted, as they have been informed, by the Colony 
Charter, and sold by the Six Nations at the treaty of 
Fort Stanwix, in 1 768. Nor is the right thereto, it is 
humbly presumed, by any means diminished by the 
nominal line, commonly called the Ministerial Line; 
since that transaction seems to have been considered by 
government as a temporary expedient, at the instigation 
of the Indian Agent, to satisfy the southern Indians, 
who, as it is said, have disclaimed any right to the very 

I do not mean to grant any patents on the western waters, as I do not 
think I am at present empowered so to do. I did, indeed, tell a poor old 
German lieutenant, who was with me, and informed me he was very poor, 
and had ten children, that I might possibly grant him a patent contiguous 
to that, which he had under Mr. Dinwiddie's proclamation, which I suppose 
is what may have given rise to the report you have heard. As to Captain 
Bullitt, I know nothing about his surveying any lands, and did, when I waa 
at Fort Pitt, write to him and advise him to return again immediately.

lands in contest ; and no further regard has been paid 
to it by the ministers themselves. 

The officers of the Virginia troops, impressed with 
these sentiments, and having undoubted reason to be- 
lieve, that there is no other chance left them to obtain 
their lands, but on the Ohio, and knowing at the same 
time, that the officers of Pennsylvania, under a belief 
that these lands appertain to Virginia, and that patents 
will be granted for them, have surveyed two hundred 
thousand acres, would fain hope, that they may be 
allowed to proceed by authority to make their surveys 
also, anywhere upon the Ohio, or its waters, below the 
Scioto ; humbly representing to your Lordship, that a 
delay in this case is, in effect, equal to a refusal, as the 
country is becoming spread over with emigrants, and 
experience has convinced all those, who have had occa- 
sion to attend to the matter, that these people when 
once fixed are not to be dispossessed, were it politic to 
attempt it. 

The officers have an entire confidence in your Lord- 
ship's disposition to promote their just rights. They 
have no other dependence, and they hope to be put on 
an equal footing with those other officers, whose pre- 
tensions are not better founded than their own. 

The part I take in bringing this matter to a hearing 
will, I hope, meet with your Lordship's excuse, as I am, 
with the greatest respect, my Lord, your Lordship's 
most obedient and most humble servant.

TO THE REVEREND DR. COOPER, PRESIDENT OF 
KING'S COLLEGE, NEW YORK. 

Mount Veraon, 15 December, 1773. 

REVEREND SIR, 

The favorable account, which you were pleased to 
transmit to me, of Mr. Custis's conduct at college, gave 
me very great satisfaction. I hoped to have felt an in- 
crease of it by his continuance at that place, under a 
gentleman so capable of instructing him in every branch 
of useful knowledge. But this hope is at an end ; and 
it has been against my wishes, that he should quit col- 
lege, in order that he may enter soon into a new scene 
of life, which I think he would be much fitter for some 
years hence, than now. * But having his own inclina- 
tion, the desires of his mother, and the acquiescence of 
almost all his relatives to encounter, I did not care, as 
he is the last of the family, to push my opposition too 
far, and I have therefore submitted to a kind of ne- 
cessity. 

Not knowing how his expenses at college may stand, 
I shall be much obliged to you if you will render me an 
account of them. You will please to charge liberally 
for your own particular attention to Mr. Custis, and 
sufficiently reward the other gentlemen, who were en- 
gaged in the same good offices. If the money I left 
with you is insufficient to answer these purposes, please 
to advise me thereof, and I will remit the deficiency. 

I am very sorry it was not in my power to see you 
whilst in these parts. I thank you very sincerely, Sir, 
for your polite regard to Mr. Custis, during his abode at 
college, and through you beg leave to offer my ac-

knowledgments in like manner to the professors. With 
very great esteem and regard, Reverend Sir, 

I am, your most obedient humble servant. 



TO JAMES TILGHMAJNT, PHILADELPHIA. 

Mount Vernon, February, 1774. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am going to give you a little trouble, because I am 
persuaded you will excuse it. No good reason, you 
will say ; but it 'is the best I can offer for such a liberty. 

Interested as well as political motives render it neces- 
sary for me to seat the lands, which I have patented on 
the Ohio, in the cheapest, most expeditious, and effec- 
tual manner. Many expedients have been proposed to 
accomplish this, but none, in my judgment, so likely to 
succeed as the importing of Palatines. But how to do 
this upon the best terms, is a question I wish to have 
answered. Few of this kind of people ever come to 
Virginia, whether because it is out of the common course 
of its trade, or because they object to it, I am unable to 
determine. I shall take it very kind in you, therefore, to 
resolve the following questions, which I am persuaded 
you can do with precision, by inquiring of such gentle- 
men, as have been engaged in this business. 

Whether there is any difficulty in procuring these 
people in Holland? If so, from whence does it pro- 
ceed 1 Whether they are to be had at all times, or at 
particular seasons only, and when 1 Whether they are 
engaged previously to sending for them, and in what 
manner ? Or do ships take their chance after getting 
there ? Upon what terms are they generally engaged ? 
And how much for each person do they commonly 
stand the importer landed at Philadelphia. ? Is it cus- 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 383 

ternary to send an intelligent German in the ship, that 
is to bring them ? Do vessels ever go immediately to 
Holland for them, and, if they do, what cargoes do they 
carry? Or are they to go round, and where? In 
short, what plan would be recommended to me, by the 
knowing ones, as best for importing a full freight, say 
two or three hundred or more, to Alexandria ? In case 
of full freight, how are the numbers generally propor- 
tioned to the tonnage of a vessel ? 

Your favor in answering these several queries, with 
any other information, which you may think necessary 
for me to be possessed of, I shall gratefully receive, as I 
am totally unacquainted with every thing of the kind. 

I hope, though you have removed from this part of 
the world, that you do not mean to forsake us altogether, 
and that it is unnecessary to add, that I shall at all times 
be happy in seeing you at this place. My best respects 
attend your good father, sisters, and brothers ; and, with 
very sincere regard, I remain, dear Sir, &c. 



TO HENRY RIDDELL. 

Mount Vernon, 22 February, 1774. 

SIR, 

Mr. Young, hearing me express a desire of importing 
Palatines to settle on my lands on the Ohio, tells me, 
that, in discoursing of this matter in your company, you 
suggested an expedient, which might probably be at- 
tended with success ; and that if I inclined to adopt it, 
you wished to be informed before the sailing of your 
ship. 

The desire of seating and improving my lands on the 
Ohio, is founded on interested as well as political views. 
But the intention of importing Palatines for the purpose 



184 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



. 42. 



was more the effect of sudden thought, than mature 
consideration, because I am totally unacquainted with 
the manner, as well as the expense of doing it ; and I 
was led into the notion principally from a report of either 
this or some other ship of yours being blamed, for riot 
taking an offered freight of these Germans at forty shil- 
lings sterling. I was thus induced to think if this charge 
was not much accumulated by other expenses, that I 
could fall on no better expedient to settle my lands with 
industrious people, than by such an importation. 

The terms upon which I have thought of importing 
Palatines, or people from Ireland, or Scotland, are these ; 
to import them at my expense, where they are una- 
ble to transport themselves, into the Potomac River, 
and from hence to the Ohio ; to have them, in the first 
case, engaged to me under indenture ; in the second, by 
some other contract equally valid, to become tenants 
upon the terms hereafter mentioned ; as without these 
securities, I would not encounter the expense, trouble, 
and hazard of such an importation. 

But to make matters as easy and agreeable as possi- 
ble to these emigrants, I will engage, on my part, that 
the indentures shall be considered in no other light, than 
as a security for reimbursing to me every expense I am 
under, with interest, in importing them, removing them 
to the land, and supporting them there, till they can raise 
a crop for their own subsistence ; giving up the said 
indentures, and considering them altogether as freemen 
and tenants, so soon as this shall happen ; not to each 
person or family respectively, but when the whole accu- 
mulated expense shall be discharged ; as I must, for my 
own safety, consider them as jointly bound for this pay- 
ment, till the expiration of the indented terms, otherwise 
T must be an inevitable loser by every death or other 
accident ; whilst they cannot, in the worst light, be con- 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 385 

sidered as more than servants at large during the in- 
dented term. I can also engage to set them down upon 
as good land as any in that country ; and, where there 
is neither house built, nor land cleared, I will allow them 
an exemption of rent four years ; and, where there is a 
house erected, and five acres of land cleared and fit for 
cultivation, two years. 

They shall have the land upon lease for twenty-one 
years, under the usual covenants ; and also at an annual 
rent, after the first becomes due, of four pounds ster- 
ling for each hundred acres, allowing each family to take 
more or less, as inclination and convenience may prompt. 
And I will, moreover, engage to renew the leases at the 
expiration of the above tw r enty-one years ; and, in like 
manner, at the end of every seven years afterwards, upon 
an increased rent, to be agreed on between the landlord 
and tenant ; or, in order to fix the matter absolutely, if 
this should be more agreeable, the rent may be increased 
at these periods in proportion to the increased value of 
that, or the adjoining lands possessed of equal advan- 
tages of soil and situation. 

These are the terms on which I thought to import 
and plant people on my Ohio lands, which are, for the 
quantity, equal if not superior to any in that country ; 
situate altogether upon the Ohio, or Great Kenhawa, 
two fine inland navigable rivers, abounding in fish and 
wild fowl of all sorts, as the lands do in wild meats of 
the best kind. 

From Alexandria to the navigable waters of the Ohio, 
along a much frequented road used by wagons, is, ac- 
cording to the computed distance, two hundred miles. 
This land -carriage, if the inland navigation of the Poto- 
mac should be effected, than which I think nothing 

o 

easier, will be reduced to sixty miles as matters now 
stand ; some say to forty, and others to twenty. But, 

VOL. II. 49 GG 



386 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [Mr. 42 

call it the greatest distance, any commodity made upon 
any part of these lands of mine may be transported 
along a very easy water-communication to the settle- 
ment of Red-stone, where the land-carriage at this time 
begins. To say nothing, therefore, of the advantages 
of raising stock of all kinds, and horses, which will carry 
themselves to market, and are now and will, from the 
nature of things, continue to be in great demand in the 
interior parts of this great continent, hemp, flax, pot- 
ashes, indigo, and the like, will well afford the expense 
of this land-carriage, admitting it never may be reduced, 
and can be cultivated to advantage on the river bottoms 
in that country. 

Having thus exhibited a general view of my design, 
I shall now be obliged to you, Sir, to inform me with 
as much precision as you can, what certainty there is 
that your ship will go to Holland; what probability 
there is of her getting Palatines, if she does go ; when 
they may be expected in this country; what would 
be the freight; and, as near as you can judge, the 
whole incidental expense attending each person de- 
livered at Alexandria ; and, moreover, whether it 
would be expected, that the whole of these charges, 
including freight, should be paid down immediately on 
the arrival of the ship here, as it must appear rather 
hard to make a certain provision for an uncertain event. 
It may not be amiss further to observe, that I see no 
prospect of these people being restrained in the smallest 
degree, either in their civil or religious principles ; which 
I take notice of, because these are privileges, which 
mankind are solicitous to enjoy, and upon which emi- 
grants must be anxious to be informed. 

I wrote to Philadelphia by the last post for full infor- 
mation of the manner and charge of importing these 
people from Holland ; and, if your account in answer to 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 387 

this letter should prove agreeable to my wishes, I will 
send a more particular description of the lands, which I 
wish to settle, as well as copies of the plots, and do any 
other matter which may be judged necessary to further 
the design. I am, &,c.* 



TO EDWARD SNICKERS. 

Williamsburg, 16 June, 1774. 

SIR, 

Enclosed you will receive Mr. Hughes's warrant in 
his own right, for two thousand acres of land, the get- 
ting of which, at this time, he must look upon as a very 
great favor, as the Governor has dispensed with two 
positive instructions to oblige him. He would not grant 
a warrant for the other claims under Johnston. Hughes 
was very negligent in not sending the former certificates 
granted him. 

I got a gentleman of my acquaintance in Maryland to 
mention his case to Governor Eden, who promised to 
have the matter inquired into, and do what he could for 
his relief. Why it has not been done, I cannot tell ; but 
if my contributing twenty or twenty -five pounds to his 
relief will procure his liberty, you may set me down for 
that sum, and I will pay it at any time when the sub- 
scription is full. But how he is to get over the other 
matter, of giving Maryland security for his good be- 
haviour, I know not. You are best acquainted with the 
circumstances of the case. I am, &,c. f

TO BRYAN FAIRFAX.* 



Mount Vernon, 4 July, 1774. 

DEAR SIR, 

John has just delivered to me your favor of yester- 
day, which I shall be obliged to answer in a more 
concise manner, than I could wish, as I am very much 
engaged in raising one of the additions to my house, 
which I think (perhaps it is fancy) goes on better whilst 
I am present, than in my absence from the workmen. 

I own to you, Sir, I wished much to hear of your 
making an open declaration of taking a poll for this 
county, upon Colonel West's publicly declining last 
Sunday ; and I should have written to you on the sub- 
ject, but for information then received from several gen- 
tlemen in the churchyard, of your having refused to do 
so, for the reasons assigned in your letter;! upon which, 
as I think the country never stood more in need of men 
of abilities and liberal sentiments than now, I entreated 
several gentlemen at our church yesterday to press 
Colonel Mason to take a poll, as I really think Major 
Broad water, though a good man, might do as well in the 
discharge of his domestic concerns, as in the capacity 



* Afterwards Lord Fairfax. See the notes in the present volume (pp. 
51, 182,) respecting the Fairfax family in America. 

f The poll here mentioned was for the election of delegates to the 
House of Burgesses. Mr. Fairfax declined, as he said, chiefly because he 
thought he could not give satisfaction at that time ; for he should think 
himself bound to oppose strong measures, and was in favor of petitioning, 
and giving Parliament a fair opportunity of repealing their obnoxious acts. 
"There are ccarce any at Alexandria," he adds, "of my opinion; and 
though the few I have elsewhere conversed Avith on the subject are so. 
yet from them I could learn, that many thought otherwise ; so that I be- 
lieve I should at this time give general dissatisfaction, and therefore it 
would be more proper to decline, even upon this account, as well as bo- 
cause it would necessarily lead me into great expenses, which my circum- 
stances will not allow." 






PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 389 

of a legislator. And therefore I again express my wish, 
that cither you or Colonel Mason would offer. I can 
be of little assistance to either, because I early laid it 
dow r n as a maxim not to propose myself, and solicit for a 
second. 

As to your political sentiments, I would heartily join 
you in them, so far as relates to a humble and dutiful 
petition to the throne, provided there was the most dis- 
tant hope of success. But have we not tried this 
already? Have we not addressed the Lords, and re- 
monstrated to the Commons 1 And to what end 1 Did 
they deign to look at our petitions ? Does it not appear, 
as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness, that there 
is a regular, systematic plan formed to fix the right and 
practice of taxation upon us? Does not the uniform 
conduct of Parliament for some years past confirm this ? 
Do not all the debates, especially those just brought to 
us, in the House of Commons on the side of government, 
expressly declare that America must be taxed in aid of 
the British funds, and that she has no longer resources 
within herself? Is there any thing to be expected from 
petitioning after this ? Is not the attack upon the liberty 
and property of the people of Boston, before restitution 
of the loss to the India Company was demanded, a plain 
and self-evident proof of what they are aiming at ? Do 
not the subsequent bills (now I dare say acts), for de- 
priving the Massachusetts Bay of its charter, and for 
transporting offenders into other colonies or to Great 
Britain for trial, where it is impossible from the nature 
of the thing that justice can be obtained, convince us 
that the administration is determined to stick at nothing 
to carry its point? Ought we not, then, to put our vir- 
tue and fortitude to the severest test ? 

With you I think it a folly to attempt more than we 
can execute, as that will not only bring disgrace upon 

GG*

us, but weaken our cause ; yet I think we may do more 
than is generally believed, in respect to the non-impor- 
tation scheme. As to the withholding of our remittances, 
that is another point, in which I own I have my doubts 
on several accounts, but principally on that of justice ; 
for I think, whilst we are accusing others of injustice, 
we should be just ourselves ; and how this can be, whilst 
we owe a considerable debt, and refuse payment of it to 
Great Britain, is to me inconceivable. Nothing but the 
last extremity, I think, can justify it. Whether this is 
now come, is the question. 

I began with telling you, that I was to write a short 
letter. My paper informs me I have done otherwise. 
I shall hope to see you to-morrow, at the meeting of the 
county in Alexandria, when these points are to be con- 
sidered. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient and hum- 
ble servant. 



TO BRYAN FAIRFAX. 

Mount Vernon, 20 July, 1774. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your letter of the 17th was not presented to me till 
after the resolutions, which were judged advisable for 
this county to adopt, had been revised, altered, and cor- 
rected in the committee ; nor till we had gone into a 
general meeting in the court-house, and my attention 
was necessarily called every moment to the business 
before us.* I did, however, upon the receipt of it, in 

* In conformity with the spirit and practice, which now began to prevail 
in different parts of the colonies, the inhabitants of Fairfax county had as- 
sembled, and appointed a committee for drawing up resolutions expressive 
of their sentiments on the great topics, which agitated the country. 
Washington was chairman of this committee, and moderator of the meet- 
ings held by the people. An able report was prepared by the committee,

that hurry and bustle, hastily run it over, and I handed 
it round to the gentlemen on the bench, of whom there 
were many ; but, as no person present seemed in the 
least disposed to adopt your sentiments, as there ap- 
peared a perfect satisfaction and acquiescence in the 
measures proposed (except from Mr. Williamson, who 
was for adopting your advice literally, without obtaining 
a second voice on his side), and as the gentlemen, to 
whom the letter was shown, advised me not to have it 
read, as it was not likely to make a convert, and was 
repugnant, some of them thought, to every principle we 
were contending for, I forbore to offer it otherwise 
than in the manner abovementioned ; which I shall be 
sorry for, if it gives you any dissatisfaction that your 
sentiments were not read to the county at large, instead 
of being communicated to the first people in it, by offer- 
ing them the letter in the manner I did. 

That I differ very widely from you, in respect to the 
mode of obtaining a repeal of the acts so much and so 
justly complained of, I shall not hesitate to acknowledge ; 
and that this difference in opinion probably proceeds 
from the different constructions we put upon the con- 
duct and intention of the ministry may also be true ; but, 
as I see nothing, on the one hand, to induce a belief, 
that the Parliament would embrace a favorable opportu- 
nity of repealing acts, which they go on with great 
rapidity to pass, in order to enforce their tyrannical sys- 
tem ; and, on the other, I observe, or think I observe, 
that government is pursuing a regular plan at the ex- 
containing a series of resolutions, which were presented at a general meet- 
ing of the inhabitants at the court-house in Fairfax county on the 18th of 
July. See APPENDIX, No. IX. 

Mr. Bryan Fairfax, who had been present on former occasions, not ap- 
proving all the resolutions, absented himself from this meeting, and wrote 
a long letter to the chairman, stating his views and objections, with the 
request that it should be publicly read. 



392 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T. 42. 

pense of law and justice to overthrow our constitutional 
rights and liberties, how can I expect any redress from 
a measure, which has been ineffectually tried already ? 
For, Sir, what is it we are contending against? Is it 
against paying the duty of three pence per pound on 
tea because burthensome ? No, it is the right only, that 
we have all along disputed ; and to this end we have al- 
ready petitioned his Majesty in as humble and dutiful a 
manner, as subjects could do. Nay, more, we applied 
to the House of Lords and House of Commons in their 
different legislative capacities, setting forth, that, as 
Englishmen, we could not be deprived of this essential 
and valuable part of our constitution. If, then, as the 
fact really is, it is against the right of taxation that we 
now do, and, as I before said, all along have contended, 
why should they suppose an exertion of this power 
would be less obnoxious now than formerly? And 
what reason have we to believe, that they would make 
a second attempt, whilst the same sentiments fill the 
breast of every American, if they did not intend to en- 
force it if possible ? * 



* Mr. Fairfax had written ; "I come now to consider a resolve, which 
ought to be the most objected to, as tending more to widen the breach, 
and prevent a reconciliation than any other. I mean that, wherein the au- 
thority of Parliament is almost in every instance denied. Something simi- 
lar to this, though more imprudent, is the most exceptionable part of the 
conduct of some in New England. It has been asserted in the House of 
Commons, that America has been gradually encroaching ; that, as they 
have given up points, we have insisted on more. The fact is true, as to 
encroachment, but the reason assigned is wrong. It is not because they 
have given up points, but because they have not given them up, that we 
out of resentment demand more than we at first thought of. But however 
natural it is for people incensed to increase their claims, and whatever our 
anger may induce us to say, in calm deliberations we should not insist on 
any thing unreasonable. We have all along submitted to the authority of 
Parliament. From the first settlement of the colonies I believe there 
never was an act of Parliament disputed, till the famous Stamp Act. It is 
a maxim in lavr, that all the acts made since the settlement of the colonies 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 393 

The conduct of the Boston people could not justify 
the rigor of their measures, unless there had been a 
requisition of payment and refusal of it ; nor did that 
conduct require an act to deprive the government of 
Massachusetts Bay of their charter, or to exempt offend- 
ers from trial in the places where offences were com- 
mitted, as there was not, nor could there be, a single 
instance produced to manifest the necessity of it. Are 
not all these things evident proofs of a fixed and uni- 
form plan to tax us? If we want further proofs, do 
not all the debates in the House of Commons serve to 
confirm this? And has not General Gage's conduct 
since his arrival, in stopping the address of his Council, 
and publishing a proclamation more becoming a Turkish 
bashaw, than an English governor, declaring it treason 
to associate in any manner by which the commerce of 
Great Britain is to be affected, has not this exhibited an 
unexampled testimony of the most despotic system of 

do not extend here, unless the colonies are particularly named ; therefore 
all acts wherein they are included do extend here. 

" When the Stamp Act was repealed, it was said, and I did not hear it 
contradicted, that the Americans objected to internal taxes, but not to ex- 
ternal duties. When the duty on tea was laid, as an external duty, we 
objected to it, and with some reason, because it was not for the regulation 
of trade, but for the express purpose of raising a revenue. This was 
deemed a small encroachment on our first demands. Some now object to 
the authority, which has established and regulated the post-office, a very 
useful regulation. Others deny their authority in regard to our internal 
affairs. If we go on at this rate, it is impossible that the troubles of Am- 
erica should ever have an end. Whatever we may wish to be the case, it 
becomes good subjects to submit to the constitution of their country. 
Whenever a political establishment has been settled, it ought to be con- 
sidered what that is, and not what it ought to be. To fix a contrary prin- 
ciple is to lay the foundation of continual broils and revolutions. 

" The Parliament from prescription have a right to make laws binding 
on the colonies, except those imposing taxes. From prescription the 
Americans are exempt from taxation. Let us stand upon good ground in 
our opposition, otherwise many upon reflection may desert the cause. 
Therefore I hope some alteration will be made in the second resolve, 
or that nothing under this head will be mentioned."

tyranny, that ever was practised in a free government? 
In short, what further proofs are wanting to satisfy any 
one of the designs of the ministry, than their own acts, 
which are uniform and plainly tending to the same point, 
nay, if I mistake not, avowedly to fix the right of taxa- 
tion ? What hope have we then from petitioning, when 
they tell us, that now or never is the time to fix the 
matter? Shall we, after this, whine and cry for relief, 
when we have already tried it in vain ? Or shall we 
supinely sit and see one province after another fall a 
sacrifice to despotism? 

If I were in any doubt, as to the right which the Par- 
liament of Great Britain had to tax us without our con- 
sent, I should most heartily coincide with you in opinion, 
that to petition, and petition only, is the proper method 
to apply for relief; because we should then be asking a 
favor, and not claiming a right, which, by the law of 
nature and by our constitution, we are, in my opinion, 
indubitably entitled to. I should even think it criminal 
to go further than this, under such an idea ; but I have 
none such. I think the Parliament of Great Britain have 
no more right to put their hands into my pocket, without 
my consent, than I have to put my hands into yours ; 
and this being already urged to them in a firm, but de- 
cent manner, by all the colonies, what reason is there 
to expect any thing from their justice ? 

As to the resolution for addressing the throne, I own 
to you, Sir, I think the whole might as well have been 
expunged. I expect nothing from the measure, nor 
should my voice have sanctioned it, if the non-importa- 
tion scheme was intended to be retarded by it ; * for I 

* Among the Alexandria resolves, which were the subject of Mr. Fair- 
fax's letter, there was one for petitioning the King. In relation to this, he 
wrote; "I hope it will be recommended, that, if a petition should be 
agreed upon, and sent home by the general Congress, no conditional reso-

am convinced, as much as I am of my existence, that 
there is no relief for us but in their distress ; and I think, 
at least I hope, that there is public virtue enough left 
among us to deny ourselves every thing but the bare 
necessaries of life to accomplish this end. This we have 
a right to do, and no power upon earth can compel us 
to do otherwise, till it has first reduced us to the most 
abject state of slavery. The stopping of our exports 
would, no doubt, be a shorter method than the other to 
effect this purpose; but if we owe money to Great 
Britain, nothing but the last necessity can justify the 
non-payment of it ; and, therefore, I have great doubts 
upon this head, and wish to see the other method first 
tried, which is legal and will facilitate these payments. 

I cannot conclude without expressing some concern, 
that I should differ so widely in sentiments from you, on 
a matter of such great moment and general import ; and 
I should much distrust my own judgment upon the oc- 
casion, if my nature did not recoil at the thought of sub- 
mitting to measures, which I think subversive of every 
thing that I ought to hold dear and valuable, and did I 
not find, at the same time, that the voice of mankind is 
with me. I must apologize for sending you so rough a 



lution, which may be formed at the time, should be published until it is 
known, that the petition has had no effect. For we should otherwise de- 
stroy the very intention of it. To petition and to threaten at the same 
time seems to be inconsistent. It might be of service with the ministry, if 
they have evil designs, to know the dispositions of the people here. I am 
sure that sufficiently appears from what has already been published. And 
if that appears, no threatenings ought to accompany the petition. It ought 
to be as modest as possible, without descending to meanness. There is 
one expression, then, in one of our resolves, which I much object to ; that 
is, a hint to the King, that, if his Majesty will not comply, there lies but 
one appeal. This ought surely to be erased. There are two methods 
proposed to effect a repeal ; the one by petition, the other by compulsion. 
They ought then to be kept separate and distinct, and we shall find fet 
for joining them together, who arc not rather against the former."

TO BRYAN FAIRFAX. 

Mount Vernon, 24 August, 1774. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your letter of the 5th instant came to this place, for- 
warded by Mr. Ramsay, a few days after my return 
from William sbu rg, * and I delayed acknowledging it 
sooner, in the hope that I should find time, before I 
began my journey to Philadelphia, to answer it fully, 
if not satisfactorily ; but, as much of my time has been 

* In compliance with the recommendation of the deputies, who sent out 
a circular from Williamsburg on the 31st of May, town and county meet- 
ings had been held in all parts of the colony, and delegates chosen to as- 
semble in convention at Williamsburg on the 1st of August. Washington 
was elected for Fairfax county, and was present at the Convention. By 
this body were appointed delegates to meet those from other colonies 
in a general congress at Philadelphia, in the September following. The 
persons, selected were Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, George 
Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison, and Ed- 
mund Pendleton. The other important acts of the Convention were the 
instructions to these deputies (Wirt's Life of Patrick Henry, p. 101), and 
a series of resolves put forth in the form of an Association. Burk's His- 
tory of Virginia, Vol. III. p. 382. These resolves are nearly the same in 
substance and temper as those, which had been adopted two weeks before 
in Fairfax county. - After sitting six days the Convention broke up, having 
authorized the moderator, Peyton Randolph, to call the deputies together 
again on any occasion, which he might deem expedient. 

According to Governor Hutchinson, the idea of a General Congress 
originated with Dr. Franklin, and was first suggested by him in a letter to 
the Massachusetts Assembly. History of Massachusetts, Vol. III. p. 393. 
The date of this suggestion is not mentioned ; but in the early part of the 
year 1774, the necessity of such a congress began to be a popular senti- 
ment throughout all the colonies.

engrossed since I came home by company, by your 
brother's sale and the business consequent thereupon, 
in writing letters to England, and now in attending to 
my own domestic affairs previous to my departure, I 
find it impossible to bestow as much attention on the 
subject of your letter as I could wish, and, therefore, I 
must rely upon your good nature and candor in excuse 
for not attempting it. * In truth, persuaded as I am, 
that you have read all the political pieces, which com- 
pose a large share of the gazettes at this time, I should 
think it, but for your request, a piece of inexcusable ar- 
rogance in me, to make the least essay towards a change 
in your political opinions ; for I am sure I have no new 
light to throw upon the subject, nor any other argu- 
ments to offer in support of my own doctrine, than what 
you have seen ; .and I could only in general add, that an 
innate spirit of freedom first told me, that the measures, 
which the administration have for some time been, and 
now are most violently pursuing, are opposed to every 
principle of natural justice; whilst much abler heads 
than my own have fully convinced me, that they are not 
only repugnant to natural right, but subversive of the 
laws and constitution of Great Britain itself, in the es- 
tablishment of which some of the best blood in the king- 
dom has been spilt. 

* In his last letter, Mr. Fairfax had taken a wide view of the sub- 
ject, and requested a full reply. " I am uneasy to find," he says, " that 
any one should look upon the letter sent down, as repugnant to the princi- 
ple we are contending for ; and, therefore, when you have leisure, I shall 
take it as a favor if you will let me know wherein it was thought so. I 
beg leave to look upon you as a friend, and it is a great relief to unbosom 
one's thoughts to a friend. Besides, the information, and the correction 
of my errors, which I may obtain from a correspondence, are great in- 
ducements to it. For I am convinced, that no man in the colony wishea 
its prosperity more, would go greater lengths to serve it, or is at the same 
time a better subject to the crown. Pray excuse these compliments ; they 
may be tolerable from a friend."

Satisfied, then, that the acts of the British Parliament 
are no longer governed by the principles of justice, that 
they are trampling upon the valuable rights of Ameri- 
cans, confirmed to them by charter and by the constitu- 
tion they themselves boast of, and convinced beyond the 
smallest doubt, that these measures are the result of de- 
liberation, and attempted to be carried into execution 
by the hand of power, is it a time to trifle, or risk our 
cause upon petitions, which with difficulty obtain access, 
and afterwards are thrown by with the utmost con- 
tempt ? Or should we, because heretofore unsuspicious 
of design, and then unwilling to enter into disputes with 
the mother country, go on to bear more, and forbear to 
enumerate our just causes of complaint ? For my own 
part, I shall not undertake to say where the line be- 
tween Great Britain and the colonies should be drawn ; 
but I am clearly of opinion, that one ought to be drawn, 
and our rights clearly ascertained. I could wish, I own, 
that the dispute had been left to posterity to determine, 
but the crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights, 
or submit to every imposition, that can be heaped upon 
us, till custom and use shall make us tame and abject 
slaves. 

I intended to write no more than an apology for not 
writing ; but I find I am insensibly running into a length 
I did not expect, and therefore shall conclude with re- 
marking, that, if you disavow the right of Parliament to 
tax us, unrepresented as we are, we only differ in re- 
spect to the mode of opposition, and this difference 
principally arises from your belief, that they (the Parlia- 
ment, I mean,) want a decent opportunity to repeal the 
acts ; whilst I am fully convinced, that there has been a 
regular, systematic plan formed to enforce them, and 
that nothing but unanimity and firmness in the colonies, 
which they did not expect, can prevent it. By the best

advices from Boston it seems, that General Gage is ex- 
ceedingly disconcerted at the quiet and steady conduct 
of the people of the Massachusetts Bay, and at the 
measures pursuing by the other governments. I dare 
say he expected to force those oppressed people into 
compliance, or irritate them to acts of violence before 
this, for a more colorable pretence of ruling that and the 
other colonies with a high hand. 

I shall set off on Wednesday next for Philadelphia, 
where, if you have any commands, I shall be glad to 
oblige you in them ; being, dear Sir, with real regard, 

Your most obedient servant. 

P. S. Pray what do you think of the Canada Bill?

Philadelphia, 9 October, 1774.

pleasure, as I learnt thereby, that you were well, and 
might be expected at Mount Vernon in your way to or

September 13th, 1774. 

" Mr., Atcheson can sufficiently inform you of the state of this unhappy

at total independence, of the weakness and temper of the mainsprings that 
set the whole in motion, and how necessary it is, that abler heads and bet-

express my sorrow, that fortune should place you in a 
service, that must fix curses to the latest posterity upon 
the contrivers, and, if success (which, by the by, is 
impossible) accompanies it, execrations upon all those, 
who have been instrumental in the execution. 

I do not mean by this to insinuate, that an officer is 
not to discharge his duty, even when chance, not choice, 
has placed him in a disagreeable situation ; but I con- 
ceive, when you condemn the conduct of the Massachu- 
setts people, you reason from effects, not causes ; other- 
wise you would not wonder at a people, who are every 
day receiving fresh proofs of a systematic assertion of 
an arbitrary power, deeply planned to overturn the laws 
and constitution of their country, and to violate the most 
essential and valuable rights of mankind, being irritated, 
and with difficulty restrained from acts of the greatest 
violence and intemperance. For my own part, I con- 
fess to you candidly, that I view things in a very dif- 
ferent point of light from the one in which you seem to 
consider them ; and though you are led to believe by 
venal men, for such I must take the liberty of calling 
those new-fangled counsellors, who fly to and surround 
you, and all others, who, for honors or pecuniary gratifi- 
cations, will lend their aid to overturn the constitution, 
and introduce a system of arbitrary government, al- 
though you are taught, I say, by discoursing with such 

ter hearts should draw a line for their guidance. Even when this is done, 
it is much to be feared, that they will follow it no further, than it coincides 
with their present sentiments. 

"Amidst all these jarrings we have until lately lived in a camp of pleas- 
ure ; but the rebellious and numerous meetings of men in arms, their scan- 
dalous and ungenerous attacks upon the best characters in the province, 
obliging them to save themselves by flight, and their repeated but feeble 
threats to dispossess the troops, have furnished sufficient reasons to Gene- 
ral Gage to put the town in a formidable state of defence, about which we 
are now fully employed, and which will be shortly accomplished to their 
great mortification." 



PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 401 

men, to believe, that the people of Massachusetts are 
rebellious, setting up for independency, and what not, 
give me leave, my good friend, to tell you, that you are 
abused, grossly abused. This I advance with a degree 
of confidence and boldness, which may claim your belief, 
having better opportunities of knowing the real senti- 
ments of the people you are among, from the leaders of 
them, in opposition to the present measures of the ad- 
ministration, than you have from those whose business 
it is, not to disclose truths, but to misrepresent facts in 
order to justify as much as possible to the world their 
own conduct.* Give me leave to add, and I think I 
can announce it as a fact, that it is not the wish or inter- 
est of that government, or any other upon this continent, 
separately or collectively, to set up for independence ; 
but this you may at the same time rely on, that none of 
them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights 
and privileges, which are essential to the happiness of 
every free state, and without which, life, liberty, and 
property are rendered totally insecure. 

These, Sir, being certain consequences, which must 
naturally result from the late acts of Parliament relative 
to America in general, and the government of Massa- 
chusetts Bay in particular, is it to be wondered at, I 
repeat, that men, who wish to avert the impending 
blow, should attempt to oppose it in its progress, or 
prepare for their defence, if it cannot be averted? 
Surely I may be allowed to answer in the negative; and 
again give me leave to add as my opinion, that more

blood will be spilled on this occasion, if the ministry are 
determined to push matters to extremity, than history 
has ever yet furnished instances of in the annals of 
North America, and such a vital wound will be given to 
the peace of this great country, as time itself cannot 
cure, or eradicate the remembrance of. 

But I have done. I was involuntarily led into a short 
discussion of this subject by your remarks on the con- 
duct of the Boston people, and your opinion of their 
wishes to set up for independency. I am well satisfied, 
that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all 
North America ; on the contrary, that it is the ardent 
wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace 
and tranquillity, upon constitutional grounds, may be 
restored, and the horrors of civil discord prevented. 

I am very glad to learn, that my friend Stewart was 
well when you left London. I have not had a letter 
from him these five years, nor heard of him I think for 
two. I wish you had mentioned his employment. 
I remain, dear Sir, your most obedient servant. *

Your letter of the 8th, which is just handed to me, 
could not have given you more pain in writing, than it

hesitate in granting any request, that is made to me, es- 
pecially by persons I esteem, and in matters of moment, 
without feeling inexpressible uneasiness. I do not won- 
der at your solicitude on account of your only son. The

nurturing and bringing him up in a proper course is, no 
doubt, an object of great concern to you, as well as im- 
portance to him ; but two things are essentially neces- 
sary in the man to whom this charge is committed, a 
capacity of judging w r ith propriety of measures proper 
to be taken in the government of a youth, and leisure 
sufficient to attend to the execution of these measures. 
That you are pleased to think favorably of me, in re- 
spect to the first, I shall take for granted, from the re- 
quest you have made ; but to show my incapacity of 
attending to the latter, with that good faith, which I 
think every man ought to use, who undertakes a trust of 
this interesting nature, I can solemnly declare to yon, 
that, for a year or two past, there has been scarce a 
moment, that I could properly call my own. What with 
my own business, my present ward's, my mother's, 
which is wholly in my hands, Colonel Colvill's, Mrs. 
Savage's, Colonel Fairfax's, Colonel Mercer's, and the 
little assistance I have undertaken to give in the man- 
agement of my brother Augustine's concerns (for I have 
absolutely refused to qualify as an executor), together 
with the share I take in public affairs, I have been kept 
constantly engaged in writing letters, settling accounts, 
and negotiating one piece of business or another; by 
which means I have really been deprived of every kind 
of enjoyment, and had almost fully resolved to engage 
in no fresh matter, till I had entirely wound up the old. 

Thus much, Sir, candor, indeed the principle of com- 
mon honesty, obliged me to relate to you, as it is not my 
wish to deceive any person by promising what I do not 
think it in my power to perform with that punctuality and 
rectitude, which I conceive the nature of the trust would 
require. I do not, however, give a flat refusal to your 
request. I rather wish you to be fully informed of my 
situation, that you may think with me, or as I do, that,

if it should please the Almighty to take you to himself 
so soon as you apprehend (but I hope without just 
cause), your son may be placed in better hands than 
mine. If you think otherwise, I will do the best I can, 
merely as a guardian. 

You. will act very prudently in having your will re- 
vised by some person skilled in the law, as a testator's 
intentions are often defeated by different interpretations 
of statutes, which require the whole business of a man's 
life to be perfectly conversant with them. I shall not, 
after what I have here said, add any thing more than my 
wishes, which are sincerely offered, for your recovery, 
and that you may live to see the accomplishment of 
your son's education. With very great esteem, Sir, 
I am your most obedient humble servant.

stant, but as one is generally in a hurry and bustle in 
such places, and at such times, as these, I have only 
time to acknowledge it, and add, that it would have 
given me pleasure to meet you here. I shall refer you 
to Mr. Smith for an account of our proceedings up to 
this day, and you cannot fail of learning the rest from 
the 'Squire, who delights in the minutiae of a tale. I 
am in doubt whether we shall finish here this week; 
but as I shall delay little time on the road in returning, I 
shall hope to see you on your way up, or down, from 
Berkeley. I am much obliged to you for the holly-

I had like to have forgotten to express my entire ap- 
probation of the laudable pursuit you are engaged in, of 
training an independent company. I have promised to 
review the independent company of Richmond some 
time this summer, they having made me a tender of the 
command of it. At the same time I could review yours, 
and shall very cheerfully accept the honor of command- 
ing it, if occasion require it to be drawn out, as it is my 
full intention to devote my life and fortune in the cause 
we are engaged in, if needful, f 

I remain, dear Sir, your most affectionate brother. 



* Washington was now attending the second Virginia Convention, 
which met at Richmond on the 20th of March. At this Convention 
Patrick Henry introduced resolutions for putting the colony in a state of 
defence, and embodying, arming, and disciplining a sufficient number of 
men for that purpose. This was considered a bold measure, and was op- 
posed by some of the ablest patriots in the Assembly. It ,was on this 
occasion, and in defence of his resolutions, that Mr. Henry uttered his 
memorable declaration ; " We must fight ! I repeat it, Sir, we must 
fight ! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all that is left to 
us ! " The resolutions were carried, and a plan adopted for putting them 
in execution. Washington was one of the committee for drafting and 
reporting this plan. 

The former deputies were reappointed to the next Continental Congress, 
Mr. Jefferson being substituted for Peyton Randolph, in case the latter 
should not be able to attend. 

In connexion with the above declaration of Patrick Henry, it is proper 
to state, that the expression, " We must fight" was used four months pre- 
viously by the ardent patriot Major Hawley of Massachusetts, in a letter 
to Mr. John Adams, which Mr. Adams showed to Mr. Henry while they 
were together in the first Congress. Tudor's lAfe of Otis, p. 256. 

f Soon after the war broke out, spurious letters were circulated in the 
name of Washington, tending to show, that he did not engage heartily in 
the cause of his country at the beginning of her complaints. These asser- 
tions were repeated and believed ; they crept into history ; they were 
revived by his political opponents, for no good purpose, near the close of his 
life. They do not require confutation. If they did, we need only refer to 
his letter to .George Mason, dated April 5th, 1769 ; the Fairfax county 
resolves ; his letters to Bryan Fairfax and Captain Mackenzie in 1774 ; 



106 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [&T. 4a 



TO GEORGE WILLIAM FAIRFAX, ENGLAND. 

Philadelphia, 31 May, 1775. * 

DEAR SIR, 

Before this letter will come to hand, you must un- 
doubtedly have received an account of the engagement 
in the Massachusetts Bay, between the ministerial 
troops (for we do not, nor can we yet prevail upon our- 
selves to call them the King's troops), and the provin- 
cials of that government. But as you may not have 
heard how that affair began, I enclose you the several 
affidavits, which were taken after the action. 

General Gage acknowledges, that the detachment 
under Lieutenant- Colon el Smith was sent out to destroy 
private property; or, in other words, to destroy a 
magazine, which self-preservation obliged the inhabit- 
ants to establish. And he also confesses, in effect at 
least, that his men made a very precipitate retreat from 
Concord, notwithstanding the reinforcement under Lord 
Percy ; the last of which may serve to convince Lord 
Sandwich, and others of the same sentiment, that the 
Americans will fight for their liberties and property, 
however pusillanimous in his Lordship's eye they may 
appear in other respects. 

From the best accounts I have been able to collect 
of that affair, indeed from every one, I believe the fact, 
stripped of all coloring, to be plainly this, that, if the 
retreat had not been as precipitate as it was, and God 
knows it could not well have been more so, the minis- 
terial troops must have surrendered, or been totally cut 
off. For they had not arrived in Charlestown (under 

the above letter to his brother; and the uniform tenor of his conduct. See

which assembled in Philadelphia on the 10th of May.

cover of their ships) half an hour, before a powerful 
body of men from Marblehead and Salem was at their 
heels, and must, if they had happened to be up one 
hour sooner, inevitably have intercepted their retreat to 
Charlestown. Unhappy it is, though, to reflect, that a 
brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, 
and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America 
are either to be drenched with blood, or inhabited by 
slaves. Sad alternative ! But can a virtuous man hesi- 
tate in his choice ? 

I am with sincere regard, and affectionate compli- 
ments to Mrs. Fairfax, dear 'Sir, your &,c.

WASHINGTON'S EARLY PAPERS. 

AMONG the earliest papers, found in the archives at Mount Ver- 
non, were the fragments of manuscripts written by Washington 
during his boyhood and youth. These are chiefly confined to his 
school exercises in arithmetic and geometry, and are of little value. 
They are remarkable only for the neatness of the handwriting, a 
beautiful method, accuracy in drawing the geometrical figures, and 
as indicating the strong bent of his inclination to mathematical 
studies. Some of his original field-books, and a brief journal of one 
of his expeditions as a surveyor of lands, are also preserved. A few 
short extracts from these papers may not be amiss, as showing the 
turn of his mind in early youth, and other traits in some degree 
characteristic. 

The first manuscript in the order of dates was written when 
he was thirteen years old, filling thirty folio pages, and entitled 
" Forms of Writing" It consists for the most part of forms used in 
the various transactions of business, such as a note of hand, bill of 
exchange, bond, indenture, lease, and will, copied out with much 
exactness and care. Then follow two or three poetical selections, 
among which are lines on True Happiness, abounding more in sen- 
timent than poetry. But the most curious piece in the manuscript is 
a series of maxims, under the head of " Rules of Civility and Decent 
Bcharinur in Company and Conversation" One hundred and ten 
rules are here written out and numbered. The source from which 
they were derived is not mentioned. They form a minute code of 
regulations for building up the habits of morals, manners, and good 
conduct in a very young person. A few specimens will be enough to 
show their general complexion ; and whoever has studied the charac-

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX- 



ter of Washington will be persuaded, that some of its most prominent 
features took their shape from these rules thus early selected and 
adopted as his guide. 

" 1. Every action in company ought to be with some sign of re- 
spect to those present. 

" 2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with a hum- 
ming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet. 

"3. Sleep not when others speak, sit not when others stand, 
speak not when you should hold your peace, walk not when others 
stop. 

"4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking; jog 
not the table or desk on which another reads or writes ; lean not on 
any one. 

" 5. Be no flatterer ; neither play with any one, that delights not 
to be played with. 

" 6. Read no letters, books, or papers in company ; but when 
there is a necessity for doing it, you must ask leave. Come not near 
the books or writings of any one so as to read them, unless desired, 
nor give your opinion of them unasked ; also, look not nigh when 
another is writing a letter. 

" 7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious matters 
somewhat grave. 

" 8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortune of another, though 
he were your enemy. 

" 9. When you meet with one of greater quality than yourself, 
stop and retire, especially if it be at a door or any strait place, to 
give way for him to pass. 

" 10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all places 
precedency ; but whilst they are young they ought to respect those 
that are their equals in birth, or other qualities, though they have 
no public charge. 

"11. It is good manners to prefer them to whom we speak before 
ourselves, especially if they be above us, with whom in no sort we 
ought to begin. 

" 12. Let your discourse with men of business be short and com- 
prehensive. 

" 13. In visiting the sick, do not presently play the physician, if 
you be not knowing therein. 

" 14. In writing, or speaking, give to every person his due title, 
according to his degree and the custom of the place. 

"15. Strive not with your superiors in argument, but always 
submit your judgment to others with modesty. 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 413 

" 16. Undertake not to teach your equal in the art himself pro- 
fesses ; it savours of arrogancy. 

" 17. When a man does all he can, though it succeeds not well, 
blame not him that did it. 

" 18. Being to advise, or reprehend any one, consider whether 
it ought to be in public or in private, presently or at some other 
time, in what terms to do it ; and in reproving show no signs of 
choler, but do it with sweetness and mildness. 

" 19. Take all admonitions thankfully, in what time or place 
soever given ; but afterwards, not being culpable, take a time or place 
convenient to let him know it that gave them. 

" 20. Mock not, nor jest at any thing of importance ; break no 
jests that are sharp-biting, and if you deliver any thing witty, and 
pleasant, abstain from laughing thereat yourself. 

"21. Wherein you reprove another be unblamable yourself ; for 
example is more prevalent than precepts. 

" 22. Use no reproachful language against any one, neither curse, 
nor revile. 

" 23. Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement 
of any. 

" 24. In your apparel, be modest, and endeavour to accommodate 
nature, rather than to procure admiration ; keep to the fashion of 
your equals, such as are civil and orderly with respect to times 
and places. 

" 25. Play not the peacock, looking every where about you to see 
if you be well decked, if your shoes fit well, if your stockings sit 
neatly, and clothes handsomely. 

" 26. Associate yourself with men of good quality, if you esteem 
your own refutation, for it is better to be alone, than in bad com- 
pany. 

" 27. Let your conversation be without malice or envy, for it is 
a sign of a tractable and commendable nature ; and in all causes 
of passion, admit reason to govern. 

"28. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover a secret. 

"29. Utter not base and frivolous things amongst grave and 
learned men; nor very difficult questions or subjects among the 
ignorant ; nor things hard to be believed. 

" 30. Speak not of doleful things in time of mirth, nor at the 
table ; speak not of melancholy things, as death, and wounds, and 
if others mention them, change, if you can, the discourse. Tell 
not your dreams, but to your intimate friend. 

"31. Break not a jest where none takes pleasure in mirth; laugh 

II* 



414 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

not aloud, nor at all without occasion. Deride no man's misfortune, 
though there seem to be some cause. 

" 32. Speak not injurious words neither in jest nor earnest ; 
scoff at none, although they give occasion. 

"33. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the first to 
salute, hear, and answer ; and be not pensive when it is a time to 
converse. 

" 34. Detract not from others, neither be excessive in commending. 

" 35. Go not thither, where .you know not whether you shall be 
welcome or not. Give not advice without being asked, and when 
desired, do it briefly. 

"36. If two contend together take not the part of either un- 
constrained, and be not obstinate in your own opinion ; in things 
indifferent be of the major side. 

" 37. Reprehend not the imperfections of others, for that belongs 
to parents, masters, and superiors. 

" 38. Gaze not on the marks or blemishes of others, and ask not 
iiow they came. What you may speak in secret to your friend, de- 
liver not before others. 

" 39. Speak not in an unknown tongue in company, but in your 
own language, and that as those of quality do, and not as the vulgar : 
sublime matters treat seriously. 

"40. Think before you speak, pronounce not imperfectly, nor 
bring out your words too hastily, but orderly and distinctly. 

"41. When another speaks, be attentive yourself, arid disturb not 
the audience. If any hesitate in his words, help him not, nor 
prompt him without being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer 
him, till his speech be ended. 

" 42. Treat with men at fit times about business , and whisper 
not in the company of others. 

" 43. Make no comparisons, and if any of the company be com- 
mended for any brave act of virtue, commend not another for the 
same. 

" 44. Be not apt to relate news, if you know not the truth thereof. 
In discoursing of things you have heard, name not your author 
always. A secret discover not. 

"45. Be not curious to know the affairs of others, neither ap- 
proach to those that speak in private. 

" 46. Undertake not what you cannot perform, but be careful to 
keep your promise. 

" 47. When you deliver a matter, do it without passion, and with 
discretion, however mean the person be you do it to. 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 415 

" 48. When your superiors talk to any body, hearken not, neither 
speak, nor laugh. 

"49. In disputes be not so desirous to overcome, as not to give 
liberty to each one to deliver his opinion, and submit to the judg- 
ment of the major part, especially if they are judges of the dis- 
pute. 

"50. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions, 
nor repeat often the same manner of discourse. 

"51. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust. 

" 52. Make no show of taking great delight in your victuals ; feed 
not with greediness ; cut your bread with a knife ; lean not on the 
table ; neither find fault with what you eat. 

"53. Be not angry at table, whatever happens, and if you have 
reason to be so, show it not ; put on a cheerful countenance, 
especially if there be strangers, for good humor makes one dish of 
meat a feast. 

" 54. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table ; but if it be 
your due, or that the master of the house will have it so, contend 
not, lest you should trouble the company. 

"55. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it be seriously 
in reverence. Honor and obey your natural parents, although they 
be poor. 

" 56. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful. 

" 57. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celes- 
tial fire, called conscience." 

The list might be extended, but these specimens will answer the 
purpose here designed, which is to indicate the sources of some of 
the impressions, that contributed to form the character of Wash- 



ington. 



His military propensities early discovered themselves, and at the 
age of fourteen he was seized with a desire to enter the navy. His 
brother Lawrence, who was himself a military man, approved this 
choice, and procured for him a midshipman's warrant. At first his 
mother seemed to consent, though reluctantly, to this project ; but as 
the time of separation approached, her maternal feelings, and more 
mature reflection, caused her to waver in her decision, and finally to 
oppose the wishes of her son and his friends. The following is an 
extract from a letter written to Lawrence Washington by his father- 
in-law, William Fairfax, and dated September 10th, 1746. 

" George has been with us, and says he will be steady, and thank- 
fully follow your advice as his best friend. I gave him his mother's 
letter to deliver, with a caution not to show his. I have spoken to 



416 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

Dr. Spencer, who I find is often at the widow's [Mrs. Washington's], 
and has some influence, to persuade her to think better of your ad- 
vice in putting George to sea with good recommendations." 

The following extract, on the same subject, was written by 
Mr. Robert Jackson to Lawrence Washington, and dated at Freder- 
icksburg, October 18th, 1746. 

" I am afraid Mrs. Washington will not keep up to her first reso- 
lution. She seems to intimate a dislike to George's going to sea, and 
says several persons have told her it was a bad scheme. She offers 
several trifling objections, such as fond, unthinking mothers habitu- 
ally suggest ; and I find that one word against his going has more 
weight than ten for it. Colonel Fairfax seems desirous he should 
go, and wished me to acquaint you with Mrs. Washington's senti- 
ments. I intend shortly to take an opportunity to talk with her, and 
will let you know the result." 

These are the only written facts, which I have found, relating to 
this incident in the life of Washington. It is known, that his 
mother's opposition continued, and that on this account the plan of 
his going to sea was abandoned. The feelings of the mother will 
act be thought unnatural, or unreasonable, when it is remembered, 
that he was her eldest son, that his father had been dead three years 
and a half, and that she was left with four younger children. 

His predilection for mathematical studies made him soon ac- 
quainted with the art of surveying lands, and he became a practical 
surveyor at the age of sixteen. He went into the woods upon a 
surveying tour among the Allegany mountains, accompanied by 
Mr. George Fairfax, in March, 1748, being then but just sixteen 
years old. He kept a rough journal, or diary, from which the fol- 
lowing extracts are taken. 

" March V&tli. Rode to his Lordship's [Lord Fairfax's] quarter. 
About four miles higher up the river Shenandoah we went through 
most beautiful groves of sugar trees, and spent the best part of the 
day in admiring the trees and richness of the land. 

" 14^. We sent our baggage to Captain Kite's, near Frederick- 
town [afterwards Winchester], and went ourselves down the river 
about sixteen miles, (the land exceedingly rich all the way, producing 
abundance of grain, hemp, and tobacco,) in order to lay off some 
land on Gate's Marsh and Long Marsh. 

" 15th. Worked hard till night, and then returned. After sup- 
per we were lighted into a room, and I, not being so good a woods- 
man as the rest, stripped myself very orderly, and went into the bed, 
as they called it, when to my surprise I fourd it to be nothing but a

little straw matted together, without sheet or any thing else but only 
one threadbare blanket, with double its weight of vermin. 1 was 
glad to get up, and put on my clothes, and lie as my companions did. 
Had we not been very tired, I am sure we should not have slept 
much that night. I made a promise to sleep so no more, choosing 
rather to sleep in the open air before a fire. 

" 18th. We travelled to Thomas Berwick's on the Potomac, 
where we found the river exceedingly high, by reason of the great 
rains that had fallen among the Alleganies. They told us it would 
not be fordable for several day$, it being now six feet higher than 
usual, and rising. We agreed to stay till Monday. We this day 
called to see the famed Warm Springs. * We camped out in the 
field this night. 

" 20^. Finding the river not much abated, we in the evening 
swam our horses over to the Maryland side. 

"21s. We went over in a canoe, and travelled up the Maryland 
side all day in a continued rain to Colonel Cresap's, over against the 
mouth of the South Branch, about forty miles from our place of start- 
ing in the morning, and over the worst road I believe that ever wa& 
trod by man or beast. 

" 23c?. Rained till about two o'clock, and then cleared up, when 
we were agreeably surprised at the sight of more than thirty Indians 
coming from war with only one scalp. We had some liquor with us, 
of which we gave them a part. This, elevating their spirits, put them 
in the humor of dancing. We then had a war-dance. After clear- 
ing a large space and making a great fire in the middle, the men 
seated themselves around it, and the speaker made a grand speech, 
telling them in what manner they were to dance. After he had fin- 
ished, the best dancer jumped up, as one awaked from sleep, and 
ran and jumped about the ring in a most comical manner. He was 
followed by the rest. Then began their music, which was performed 
with a pot half full of water and a deerskin stretched tight over it, 
and a gourd with some shot in it to rattle, and a piece of horse's tail 
tied to it to make it look fine. One person kept rattling and another 
drumming all the while they were dancing. 

" 25M. Left Cresap's, and went up to the mouth of Patterson's 
Creek. There we swam our horses over the Potomac, and went 
over ourselves in a canoe, and travelled fifteen miles where we 
camped. 

* The mineral springs at Bath, in Virginia, afterwards and at the present 
day the resort of many visitors in the summer season.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

Travelled up to Solomon Hedge's, Esquire, one of his 
Taj 'esty's justices of the peace in the county of Frederic, where we 
camped. When we came to supper, there was neither a knife on the 
table, nor a fork to eat with ; but, as good luck would have it, we 
had knives of our own. 

'"28th. Travelled up the South Branch (having come to that 
river yesterday), about thirty miles to Mr. J. R.'s (horse-jockey), and 
about seventy miles from the mouth of the river. 

" %9th. This morning went out and surveyed five hundred acres 
of land. Shot two wild turkeys. 

"3()/j. Began our intended business of laying off lots. 

" April %d. A blowing, rainy night. Our straw, upon which 
we were lying, took fire, but I was luckily preserved by one of our 
men awaking when it was in a flame. We have run off four lots 
this day. 

" th. This morning Mr. Fairfax left us, with the intention to 
go down to the mouth of the river. We surveyed two lots, and were 
attended with a great company of people, men, women, and children, 
who followed us through the woods, showing their antic tricks. 
They seem to be as ignorant a set of people as the Indians. They 
would never speak English ; but when spoken to they all spoke 
Dutch. This day our tent was blown down by the violence of the 
wind. 

"6th. The last night was so intolerably smoky, that we were 
obliged to leave our tent to the mercy of the wind and fire. Attended 
this day by the aforesaid company. 

" 7th. This morning one of our men killed a wild turkey, that 
weighed twenty pounds. We surveyed fifteen hundred acres of land, 
and returned to Vanmeter's about one o'clock. I took my horse and 
went up to see Mr. Fairfax. We slept in Cassey's house, which was 
the first night I had slept in a house since we came to the Branch. 

"8th. We breakfasted at Cassey's, and rode down to Vanmeter's 
to get our company together, which when we had accomplished, we 
rode down below the Trough to lay off lots there. The Trough is a 
couple of ledges of mountains impassable, running side by side for 
seven or eight miles, and the river between them. You must ride 
round the back of the mountains to get below them. We camped in 
the woods, and after we had pitched our tent, and made a large fire, 
we pulled out our knapsack to recruit ourselves. Every one was his 
own cook. Our spits were forked sticks ; our plates were large 
chips. As for dishes we had none. 

. We took our farewell of the Branch and travelled over

hills and mountains to Coddy's on Great Cacapehon about forty 
miles. 

" \%th. Mr. Fairfax got safe home, and I to my brother's house 
at Mount Vernon, which concludes my journal." 

In the little volume, which contains this journal, are the rough 
drafts of letters written during the same period. They are imperfect, 
and of very little importance. One of them is descriptive of his ad- 
ventures. 

" DEAR RICHARD, 

" The receipt of your kind favor of the 2d instant afforded me un- 
speakable pleasure, as it convinces me that I am still in the memory 
of so worthy a friend, a friendship I shall ever be proud of increas- 
ing. Yours gave me the more pleasure, as I received it among bar- 
barians and an uncouth set of people. Since you received my letter 
of October last, I have not slept above three or four nights in a bed, 
but, after walking a good deal all the day, I have lain down be- 
fore the fire upon a little hay, straw, fodder, or a bearskin, whichever 
was to be had, with man, wife, and children, like dogs and cats ; and 
happy is he, who gets the berth nearest the fire. Nothing would 
make it pass off tolerably but a good reward. A doubloon is my 
constant gain every day, that the weather will permit of my going 
out, and sometimes six pistoles. The coldness of the weather will 
not allow of my making a long stay, as the lodging is rather too cold 
for the time of year. I have never had my clothes off, but have lain 
and slept in them, except the few nights I have been in Frederic- 
town." 

From the tenor of two or three of the letters it would appear, that 
the charms of some beauty among his acquaintances had made an 
early assault upon the heart of the young hero. 
" DEAR FRIEND ROBIN, 

" As it is the greatest mark of friendship and esteem, which absent 
friends can show each other, to write and often communicate their 
thoughts, I shall endeavour from time to time, and at all times, to ac- 
quaint you with my situation and employments in life, and I could 
wish you would take half the pains to send me a letter by any oppor- 
tunity, as you may be well assured of its meeting with a very wel- 
come reception. 

" My place of residence at present is at his Lordship's [Lord Fair- 
fax's], where I might, were my heart disengaged, pass my time very 
pleasantly, as there is a very agreeable young lady in the same house, 
Colonel George Fairfax's wife's sister. But that only adds fuel to 
the fire, as being often and unavoidably in company with her revives

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



my former passion for your Lowland beauty ; whereas, were I to live 
more retired from young women, I might in some measure allevia 
my sorrow, by burying that chaste and troublesome passion in ob- 
livion ; and I am very well assured, that this will be the only antidote 
or remedy." 

The desponding tone of this letter is reiterated in others. Ho 
long the tender sentiment had possession of his heart, or whether h 
ever had the courage to explain himself to the young lady, is not as- 
certained. For three years he was occupied nearly all the time, 
when the season would permit, in surveying wild lands among the 
Allegany mountains in Virginia, and on the various southern 
branches of the Potomac River. His mode of life in this occupation 
may be understood from the above extracts from his journal. It was 
exposed to peculiar hardships and privations, with none of the refine- 
ments or comforts of civilization. The country was an entire wilder- 
ness. The fatigue and endurance were such, that he was rarely out 
but a few weeks at a time. His home was with his brother, Lawrence 
Washington, at Mount Vernon, though he passed portions of his time 
with his mother at Fredericksburg. 

The following letter, dated the 5th of May, 1749, was written to 
his brother Lawrence, then in Williamsburg, probably attending as a 
member of the House of Burgesses, as it is known, that he was a 
delegate for that year. 
" DEAR BROTHER, 

" I hope your cough is much mended since I saw you last. If so, 
I trust you have given over all thoughts of leaving Virginia. As 
there is not an absolute occasion of my coming down, I hope you 
will get the deeds acknowledged without me. My horse is in very 
poor order to undertake such a journey, and is in no likelihood of 
mending, for want of corn sufficient to support him ; though if there 
be any certainty of the Assembly's not rising until the latter end of

convenience of a small mill, which he has on the water-side, that 
will not grind above three months in the twelve, and on account of 
the great inconvenience and prejudice it will be to us, I hope it will 
not be granted. Besides, I do not see where he can possibly have a 
landing-place on his side, that will ever be sufficient for a lawful 
landing, by reason of the steepness of the banks. I think we suffer 
enough from the free ferry, without being troubled with such an un- 
just and iniquitous petition as that ; but I hope, as it is only a flying 
report, that he will consider better of it, and drop his pretensions. 

" I shall be glad, if it is not too much trouble, to hear from you. 
In the mean time I remain, with my love to my sister, dear Sir, your 
affectionate brother." 

George was so much indebted on many accounts to his brother 
Lawrence, that it is proper in this place to bestow upon this brother 
the tribute of a passing notice. The father, whose name was Au- 
gustine Washington, was twice married, first to Jane Butler, and 
afterwards to Mary Ball. The fruit of the first marriage was three 
sons and a daughter ; and, of the second, four sons and two daughters. 
The eldest son by the first marriage was called Butler, who died 
young. Lawrence was the second son, and was born about the year 
1718. George was the eldest son by the second marriage. Dr. Bur- 
naby, in the appendix to the third edition of his Travels in America, 
says that Lawrence was educated in England. However this may 
be, it is evident from several of his manuscript letters, which I have 
seen, that he was a gentleman of a good education and of highly re- 
spectable parts. He joined the army, and received a captain's com- 
mission, dated June 9th, 1740. He was assigned to a company in a 
regiment to be raised in America, under the command of Colonel 
Alexander Spotswood, designed for the West India service, and to 
act in the Spanish war. The regiment was transported to Jamaica 
early in 1741, where it was united with the British forces in time to 
take a part in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena, conducted by 
Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth, in March of that year. 
After the failure of the expedition the fleet sailed back to Jamaica, 
where the land forces were stationed, except during a few months in 
the summer season, when for reasons not known they were taken to 
Cuba. Captain Washington returned to Virginia near the close of 
the year 1742, having been absent about two years. 

At this time he had an intention of joining his regiment in En- 
gland, with the view of seeking promotion in the army, where he had 
good hopes of success under the friendly auspices of General Went- 
worth. But as he soon afterwards married Anne Fairfax, daughter

of William Fairfax, and a relative of Lord Fairfax, he changed his 

7 ' O 

mind, and resolved to abandon the army. Meantime his father died, 
April 12th, 1743, leaving him, as the eldest son then living, in charge 
of his estate and family. He had already obtained the post of adju- 
tant, a colonial appointment of some consideration, from which he 
derived the rank of major, and the more substantial remuneration of 
one hundred and fifty pounds a year. When the officers of his regi- 
ment obtained a grant of half-pay in England, he declined receiving 
it, on the ground that he could not conscientiously take the oath re- 
quired, while he held the adjutancy in Virginia. He inherited an 
estate on the banks of the Potomac, which he called Mount Vernon, 
in honor of Admiral Vernon, and here he resided during the re- 
mainder of his life. His time was chiefly devoted to his private af- 
fairs, as the duties of his adjutancy were only occasional and at stated 
periods. He was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and 
likewise a principal agent in forming the Ohio Company. 

Naturally of a delicate constitution, his health began to decline 
soon after his return from the military expedition to the West Indies, 
till at length it was assailed by a consumption, which made rapid 
and fatal ravages. By the advice of his physicians he went to Eng- 
land, hoping to derive benefit from the voyage, but he returned in 
a few months without essential relief. For the same object he passed 
a summer, but with little advantage, at the Bath Springs, in Virginia, 
then surrounded by a wilderness. A voyage to the West Indies 
was the last remedy, and he sailed for Barbadoes on the 28th of Sep- 
tember, 1751, and arrived there about the 3d of November. His 
brother George, to whom he was much attached, accompanied him 
on this voyage. A few weeks after his arrival in Barbadoes, he 
wrote as follows to Lord Fairfax. 

" This climate has not afforded the relief I expected from it, so 
that I have almost determined to try the Bermudas on my return, 
and, if it does not do, the dry air of Frederic. This is the finest 
island of the West Indies, but I own no place can please me without 
a change of seasons. We soon tire of the same prospect. Our 
bodies are too much relaxed, and require a winter to brace them up. 
However, some of the country gentlemen look well, and live to a rea- 
sonable age. We have no kind of bodily diversions but dancing, 
which frequently produces yellow fever. I am obliged to ride out by 
the first dawn of the day, for by the time the sun is half an hour 
high, it is as hot as at any time of the day. The gentlemen are 
very polite and hospitable." 

Having spent the winter at Barbadoes, he went to Bermuda in 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS 423 

March, 1752, his brother George in the mean time having sailed for 
Virginia. On the 6th of April he wrote from Bermuda to a friend ; 

" I have now got to my last refuge, where I must receive my final 
sentence, which at present Dr. Forbes will not pronounce. He 
leaves me, however, I think, like a criminal condemned, though not 
without hopes of a reprieve. But this I am to obtain by meritoriously 
abstaining from flesh of every sort, all strong liquors, and by riding 
as much as I can bear through several parts of the island. These 
are the only terms on which I am to hope for life. My doctor is an 
excellent guide for me to follow, who, by a perseverance in a milk 
diet, has restored his constitution from a most desperate state. These 
are hard terms, but what he further adds is still worse, that, let me 
receive what benefit I may from this climate, the next winter in Vir- 
ginia will not only render it of no service, but will most certainly 
destroy me, the truth of which assertion I am too well convinced of, 
by coming here too soon ; for though I was much mended and had 
lost some of the worst symptoms of my disorder, yet the air being 
very keen brought all on again in a worse degree than ever, and so 
they yet continue. As my endeavour to overcome this cruel disorder 
has already cost me much money and fatigue, I should unwillingly 
give over the pursuit whilst any just foundation for hope remains. 
Six weeks will determine me what to resolve on. Forbes advises 
the south of France, or else Barbadoes." 

In the same letter he expressed a strong wish, that his wife would 
come to him, as he thought, in any event, that he should remain 
there at least a year. He proposed, that George should accompany 
her to Bermuda, but he did not insist on her undertaking this voyage, 
leaving it to the decision of herself and her friends. It would seem, 
however, that his health was not restored, in the degree he had an- 
ticipated. He soon wrote again, "The unhappy state of health, 
which I labor under, makes me uncertain as to my return. If I grow 
worse, I shall hurry home to my grave ; if better, I shall be induced 
to stay longer here to complete a cure." All his hopes were fallacious. 
Although his disorder sometimes put on a more flattering aspect, 
and inspired a momentary confidence, yet it was gradually making 
its encroachments with a sure and deadly progress. He hastened 
back to Virginia, and arrived only in time to receive the last melan- 
choly greetings of his friends. He died in his own house at Mount 
Vernon, July 26th, 1752, at the age of thirty-four, and his remains 
were deposited in the same vault, in which were afterwards en- 
tombed those of his illustrious brother. 

George kept a journal pf his voyage to Barbadoes and back, and 



424 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX 

during his short residence on the island ; but time and accident have 
made such breaches in the manuscript, that little can now be gath- 
ered from it. Among other particulars he entered each day an exact 
copy of the log-book, with his own remarks on the weather, winds, 
and nautical occurrences. A few extracts from his journal, while he 
was at Barbadoes, may not be uninteresting. 

" November 4th, 1751. This morning received a card from Major 
Clarke, welcoming us to Barbadoes, \* ith an invitation to breakfast 
and dine with him. We went, myself with some reluctance, as 
the smallpox was in his family. We were received in the most kind 
and friendly manner by him. Mrs. Clarke was much indisposed, 
insomuch that we had not the pleasure of her company, but in her 
place officiated Miss Roberts, her niece, and an agreeable young 
lady. After drinking tea we were again invited to Mr. Carter's, and 
desired to make his house ours till we could provide lodgings agree- 
able to our wishes, which offer we accepted. 

"5th. Early this morning came Dr. Hilary, an eminent physi- 
cian recommended by Major Clarke, to pass his opinion on my 
brother's disorder, which he did in a favorable light, giving great 
assurances that it was not so fixed but that a cure might be effectu- 
ally made. In the cool of the evening we rode out accompanied by 
Mr. Carter to seek lodgings in the country, as the Doctor advised, 
and were perfectly enraptured with the beautiful prospects, which 
every side presented to our view, the fields of cane, corn, fruit- 
trees, &c. in a delightful green. We returned without accomplish- 
ing our intentions. 

"1th. Dined with Major Clarke, and by him was introduced to 
the Surveyor-General and the Judges, who likewise dined there. In 
the evening they complaisantly accompanied us in another excursion 
into the country to choose lodgings. We pitched on the house of 
Captain Croftan, commander of James's Fort. He was desired to 
come to town next day to propose his terms. We returned by the 
way of Needham's Fort. 

" 8th. Came Captain Croftan with his proposals, which, though 
extravagantly dear, my brother was obliged to accept. Fifteen 
pounds a month were his terms, exclusive of liquor and washing, 
which we find. In the evening we removed some of our things up, 
and went ourselves. It is very pleasantly situated near the sea, and 
about a mile from town. The prospect is extensive by land and 
pleasant by sea, as we command a view of Carlyle Bay and the 
shipping. 

"9th. Received a card from Major Clarke, inviting us to dine 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 425 

with him at Judge Maynard's tomorrow. He had a right to ask, 
being a member of a club called the Beef-steak and Tripe, instituted 
by himself. 

" 10th. We were genteelly received by Judge Maynard and his 
lady, and agreeably entertained by the company. They have a 
meeting every Saturday, this being Judge Maynard's day. After 
dinner there was the greatest collection of fruits set on the table, that 
I have yet seen, the granadilla, sapadilla, pomegranate, sweet 
orange, water-lemon, forbidden fruit, apples, guavas, &/c. &c. We 
received invitations from every gentleman there. Mr. Warren de- 
sired Major Clarke to show us the way to his house. Mr. Hacket 
insisted on our coming Saturday next to his, it being his day to treat 
with beef-steak and tripe. But, above all, the invitation of Mr. May- 
nard was most kind and friendly. He desired, and even insisted, as 
well as his lady, on our coming to spend some weeks with him, and 
promised nothing should be wanting to render our stay agreeable. 
My brother promised he would accept the invitation, as soon as he 
should be a little disengaged from the doctors. 

" 15th. Was treated with a ticket to see the play of George 
Barnwell acted. The character of Barnwell and several others were 
said to be well performed. There was music adapted and regularly 
conducted. 

" 17th. Was strongly attacked with the smallpox. Sent for 
Dr Lanahan, whose attendance was very constant till my recovery 
and going out, which were not till Thursday the 12th of December. 

" December l%th. Went to town and called on Major Clarke's 
family, who had kindly visited me in my illness, and contributed all 
they could in sending me the necessaries, which the disorder re- 
quired. On Monday last began the grand session, and this day 
was brought on the trial of Colonel C./a man of opulent fortune 
and infamous character. He was brought in guiltless, and saved 
by a single evidence, who was generally reckoned to have been 
suborned. 

"22rf. Took leave of my brother, Major Clarke, and others, and 
embarked on board the Industry for Virginia. Weighed anchor and 
got out of Carlyle Bay about twelve o'clock. 

" The Governor of Barbadoes seems to keep a proper state, lives 
very retired and at little expense, and is a gentleman of good sense. 
As he avoids the errors of his predecessor, he gives no handle for 
complaint ; but, at the same time, by declining much familiarity, he 
is not over-zealously beloved. 

" There are several singular risings in this island one above an-

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



other, so that scarcely any part is deprived of a beautiful prospect, 
both of sea and land ; and, what is contrary to observation in other 
countries, each elevation is better than the next below. There are 
many delicious fruits, but as they are particularly described by 
Mr. Hughes, in his Natural History of the Island, I shall say nothing 
further, than that the China orange is good. The avagavo pear is 
generally most admired, though none pleases my taste so well as the 
pine. The earth in most parts is extremely rich, and as black as our 
richest marsh meadows. The common produce of the cane is from 
forty to seventy polls of sugar, each poll valued at twenty shillings, out 
of which a third is deducted for expenses. Many acres last year pro- 
duced in value from one hundred and forty to one hundred and sev- 
enty pounds, as I was informed by credible authority, though that was 
in ginger, and a very extraordinary year for the sale of that article. 
How wonderful that such people should be in debt, and not be able 
to indulge themselves in all the luxuries as well as necessaries of life. 
Yet so it happens. Estates are often alienated for debts. How 
persons coming to estates of two, three, and four hundred acres 
(which are the largest), can want, is to me most wonderful. One 
third of their land, or nearly that portion, is generally in train for 
harvest. The rest is in young cane, Guinea corn (which greatly 
supports their negroes), yams, plantains, potatoes, and the like, and 
some small part left waste for stock. Provisions are generally very 
indifferent, but much better than the same quantity of pasturage 
would afford in Virginia. The very grass, that grows among their 
corn, is not lost, but carefully gathered for provender for their stock. 
" Hospitality and a genteel behaviour are shown to every gentle- 
man stranger by the gentlemen inhabitants. Taverns they have 
none, except in the towns ; so that travellers are obliged to go to 
private houses. The people are said to live to a great age where 
they are not intemperate. They are, however, very unhappy in re- 
gard to their officers' fees, which are not paid by any law. They 
complain particularly of the provost-marshal, or sheriff-general, of 
the island, patented at home and rented at eight hundred pounds a 
year. Every other officer is exorbitant in his demands. There are 
few, who may be called middling people. They are very rich or 
very poor ; for by a law of the island every gentleman is obliged to 
keep a white person for every ten acres, capable of acting in the mili- 
tia, and consequently the persons so kept cannot but be very poor 
They are well disciplined, and appointed to their several stations; so 
that in any alarm every man may be at his post in less than two hours. 
They have large intrenchments cast up wherever it is possible to

land, and, as nature has greatly assisted, the island may not improp- 
erly be said to be one entire fortification." 

These remarks were made on his departure from Barbadoes. He 
arrived in Virginia about the 1st of February, 1752, after a tempes- 
tuous passage of more than five weeks. At the time of his brother's 
death he was at Mount Vernon, and the care and immediate affairs 
of the family devolved on him. That place continued to be his resi- 
dence, till he was called from home by public duties. Lawrence 
Washington left an only child, a daughter, who deceased at an 
early age, having been sickly from her birth. The widow married 
George Lee, and the estate at Mount Vernon became the property of 
George Washington, as an inheritance from his brother, who, from 
the time of his father's death, had shown for him a parental as well 
as fraternal attachment, and rendered him many services of kindness 
and affection. Mrs. Lee died on the 19th of November, 1761. 
Judge Marshall says, that George received an appointment as one of 
the adjutants-general of Virginia, in the year 1751, with the rank of 
major, when he was yet only nineteen years old. This post was 
probably obtained through the influence of his brother. After Gov- 
ernor Dinwiddie came to Virginia, the colony was divided into four 
military districts, and an adjutant assigned to each. George Wash- 
ington's appointment was then renewed (November, 1753), and he 
was stationed over the northern district. The duties consisted in 
exercising the officers, and inspecting the militia at stated times, in 
the manner prescribed by law. 

Intelligence had been received, from time to time, that the French 
were making encroachments on what was deemed British territory 
beyond the Allegany mountains. Messengers were sent out for ob- 
servation and inquiry, who had brought back various reports, and 
particularly that a French army was approaching from Canada, with 
a view to erect fortifications on the Ohio River, and take possession 
of the whole country, in the name of the French King. As this re- 
gion was supposed to be within the limits of Virginia, Governor Din- 
widdie regarded it as his duty, in conformity with his instructions, to 
watch the motions of the French, and make preparations for defend- 
ing the British claims. He resolved to send a commissioner duly 
authorized to demand of the principal French officer his designs, to 
ascertain facts, and to make such observations as his opportunities 
would allow. Major Washington was selected for this arduous un- 
dertaking. His knowledge of the Indians, his practical acquaintance 
with the modes of living and travelling in the woods, acquired in his 
surveying expeditions, and the marked traits of character, which he 



428 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

had already displayed, were doubtless the qualities that recommended 
him for this delicate and important mission, although he was not yet 
twenty-two years of age. The following instructions from Governor 
Dinwiddie, and extracts from letters written by him to the Board of 
Trade in London, will indicate the objects and nature of this service. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

" Whereas I have received information of a body of French forces 
being assembled in a hostile manner on the river Ohio, intending by 
force of arms to erect certain forts on the said river within this terri- 
tory, and contrary to the dignity and peace of our sovereign the King 
of Great Britain ; 

" These are, therefore, to require and direct you, the said George 
Washington, forthwith to repair to Logstown on the said river Ohio 
and, having there informed yourself where the said French forces 
have posted themselves, thereupon to proceed to such place ; arid, be- 
ing there arrived, to present your credentials, together with my letter 
to the chief commanding officer, and in the name of his Britannic 
Majesty to demand an answer thereto. 

"On your arrival at Logstown you are to address yourself to the 
Half-King, to Monacatoocha, and other the sachems of the Six Na- 
tions, acquainting them with your orders to visit and deliver my letter 
to the French commanding officer, and desiring the said chiefs to 
appoint you a sufficient number of their warriors to be your safe- 
guard, as near the French as you may desire, and to wait your fur- 
ther direction. 

" You are diligently to inquire into the numbers and force of the 
French on the Ohio, and the adjacent country ; how they are likely 
to be assisted from Canada ; and what are the difficulties and conve- 
niences of that communication, and the time required for it. 

" You are to take care to be truly informed what forts the French 
have erected, and where; how they are garrisoned, and appointed, 
and what is their distance from each other, and from Logstown ; and 
from the best intelligence you can procure, you are to learn what 
gave occasion to this expedition of the French ; how they are likely 
to be supported, and what their pretensions are. 

" When the French commandant has given you the required and 
necessary despatches, you are to desire of him a proper guard to 
protect you as far on your return, as you may judge for your safety, 
against any straggling Indians or hunters, that may be ignorant of 
your character, and molest you.

speedy return, I am, &c.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, ESQUIRE, ONE OF THE ADJUTANTS-GENERAL 
OF THE TROOPS AND FORCES IN THE COLONY OF VIRGINIA. 

" I, reposing especial trust and confidence in the ability, conduct, 
and fidelity of you, the said George Washington, have appointed you 
my express messenger ; and you are hereby authorized and empow- 
ered to proceed hence, with all convenient and possible despatch, to 
that part or place, on the river Ohio, where the French have lately 
erected a fort or forts, or where the commandant of the French forces 
resides, in order to deliver my letter and message to him ; and after 
waiting not exceeding one week for an answer, you are to take your 
leave and return immediately back.

Great Britain, &,c. &c. annoque Domini, 1753.

" Williarasburg, Virginia, 17 November, 1753. 
" RIGHT HONORABLE, 

" My last to you was on the 16th of June, to which I beg you to be 
referred. In that I acquainted you of the accounts we have had of the 
French, with the Indians in their interest, invading his Majesty's 
lands on the river Ohio. 

" The person sent as a commissioner to the commandant of the 
French forces neglected his duty, and went no further than Logstowi 
on the Ohio. He reports the French were then one hundred am 
fifty miles further up that river, and I believe was afraid to go 
them. On the application of the Indians in friendship with us on the 
Ohio, I sent Mr. William Trent, with guns, powder, and shot, to 
them, with some clothing ; and enclosed I send you his report and 
conferences with these people, on his delivering them the present. * 

" I have received, by a man-of-war sloop, orders from the Right 
Honorable Earl of Holdernesse, and instructions from his Majesty. 
In consequence thereof I have sent one of the adjutants of the militia 
out to the commander of the French forces, to know their intentions 
and by what authority they presume to invade his Majesty's do- 
minions in the time of tranquil peace. When he returns I shall 
transmit you an account of his proceedings, and the French com- 
mander's answer. Your Lordships' &,c. 

" ROBERT DINWIDDIE." 

* A copy of Trent's journal is preserved among the papers in the office of 
the Board of Trade. Trent reports his having been informed by an Indian, 
that " the French say they took possession of all the lands on the other side 
of the Allegany Hill for the King of France three years ago, by sinking iron 
plates at the mouth of several of the creeks, and putting up tin plates on the 
trees." MS. Journal. This circumstance is also mentioned in Smith's 
History of Canada, Vol. I. p. 209. 

Within a few years one of these plates has been found near the mouth of the 
Muskingum. It was a leaden and not an iron plate, eight inches by ten in 
size, and three eighths of an inch thick, with an inscription dated August 
16th, 1749. In addition to the names and words of form, the inscription af- 
firms, " We have deposited this plate as a monument and memorial of the 
reestablishment of our power in the territory, which we claim near that river 
[Ohio], and near all those which empty into it, and in all that country on both 
sides, and in the neighbourhood of the sources of those rivers, and which we 
have gained to our empire by a long line of wise and prudent princes, mail 
tained by our arms and solemn treaties, especially by those of Ryswicl 
Utrecht, and Aix-la-Chapelle." The name of the officer, who deposited 
plates, was Celeron. Communicated by Mr. William Smith, of Quebec, author 
of the History of Canada.

TO THE LORDS OP THE BOARD OF TRADE. 

" Williamsburg, Virginia, 29 January, 1754. 
" RIGHT HONORABLE, 

" This is to acquaint you, that Mr. Washington, the gentleman I 
sent to the commandant of the French forces on the river Ohio, re- 
turned here the 16th current. 

" I enclose to your Lordships copies of my commission to him, his 
instructions, a letter of protection for his safe passing and repassing 
to the French camp, and my letter to the French commander. You 
also have enclosed a copy of Mr. Washington's journal, and the 
French commander's letter in answer to mine, which you may ob- 
serve is written in a very loose style. He would have been glad if this 
messenger had been directed to proceed to Canada, which is a jour- 
ney of eight hundred miles from the fort they have erected on a creek 
that runs into the Ohio, in order to prolong time. He complains that 
I did not write particulars of the ill treatment they had done to the 
British subjects, contrary to treaties subsisting between the crowns of 
Britain and France, which I could not properly do, when Mr. Wash- 
ington left this, as it was only from reports. 

" Mr. Washington had my orders to make what observations he 
could on his journey, and to take a plan of their fort, which I now 
enclose to you, and from these directions his journal becomes so 
large. He assures me, that they had begun another fort at the mouth 
of the creek, which he thinks will be finished by the month of March. 

" There were in the fort where the commander resided about three 
hundred regular forces, and nine hundred more were gone to winter- 
quarters, in order to save their provisions, to some forts on Lake Erie, 
but were to return by the month of March. Then they fully deter- 
mined, with all the forces they could collect, which he understood 
would be fifteen hundred regulars, besides Indians, to go down the 
river Ohio, and proposed building many other forts, and that their 
chief residence would be at Logstown ; and that they had near three 
hundred canoes to transport their soldiers, provisions, and ammu- 
nition. 

" They cannot offer any reasons for this extraordinary conduct, but 
their general's orders, nor can they set up any just claim to these 
lands, but their determined resolution to possess themselves of them by 
force of arms, and the ill treatment of the British subjects in the time 
of peace, inconsistent with treaties, and I humbly think, contrary to 
the law of nations. I am, &c.

Major Washington's Journal, mentioned above, was published in 
England, and has been several times reprinted in this country. It ia 
curious, not only as a narrative, but as indicating some of the strong 
traits of the writer's character. 






MAJOR WASHINGTON'S JOURNAL OF A TOUR OVER THE ALLEGANY 

MOUNTAINS. 

"I was commissioned and appointed by the Honorable Robert 
Dinwiddie, Esquire, Governor of Virginia, to visit and deliver a 
letter to the commandant of the French forces on the Ohio, and set 
out on the intended journey on the same day ; the next, I arrived 
at Fredericksburg, and engaged Mr. Jacob Vanbraam to be my 
French interpreter, and proceeded with him to Alexandria, where we 
provided necessaries. From thence we went to Winchester, and got 
baggage, horses, &/c., and from thence we pursued the new road to 
Will's Creek, where we arrived on the 14th of November. 

" Here I engaged Mr. Gist to pilot us out, and also hired four 
others as servitors, Barnaby Currin and John McQuire, Indian 
traders, Henry Steward, and William Jenkins ; and in company with 
those persons left the inhabitants the next day. 

" The excessive rains and vast quantity of snow, which had fallen, 
prevented our reaching Mr. Frazier's, an Indian trader, at the mouth 
of Turtle Creek, on Monongahela River, until Thursday the 22d. 
We were informed here, that expresses had been sent a few days 
before to the traders down the river, to acquaint them with the 
French general's death, and the return of the major part of the 
French army into winter-quarters. 

" The waters were quite impassable without swimming our horses, 
which obliged us to get the loan of a canoe from Frazier, and to 
send Barnaby Currin and Henry Steward down the Monongahela, 
with our baggage, to meet us at the Fork of the Ohio, about ten 
miles ; there to cross the Allegany. 

" As I got down before the canoe, I spent some time in viewing 
the rivers, and the land in the Fork, which I think extremely well 
situated for a fort, as it has the absolute command of both rivers. 
The land at the point is twenty, or twenty-five feet above the com- 
mon surface of the water ; and a considerable bottom of flat, well- 
timbered land all around it, very convenient for building. The rivers 
.are each a quarter of a mile or more across, and run here very nearly 
at right angles; Allegany bearing northeast; and Monongahela

southeast. The former of these two is a very rapid and swift run- 
ning water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible fall. 

" About two miles from this, on the southeast side of the river, at 
the place where the Ohio Company intended to erect a fort, lives 
Shingiss, King of the Delawares. We called upon him, to invite 
him to council at the Logstown. 

" As I had taken a good deal of notice yesterday of the situation 
at the Fork, my curiosity led me to examine this more particularly, 
and I think it greatly inferior, either for defence or advantages ; es- 
pecially the latter. For a fort at the Fork would be equally well 
situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Mononga- 
hela, which runs up our settlement, and is extremely well designed 
for water-carriage, as it is of a deep, still nature. Besides, a fort at 
the Fork might be built at much less expense than at the other 
places. 

" Nature has well contrived this lower place for water defence ; 
but the hill whereon it must stand being about a quarter of a mile 
in length, and then descending gradually on the land side, will ren- 
der it difficult and very expensive to make a sufficient fortification 
there. The whole flat upon the hill must be taken in, the side next 
the descent made extremely high, or else the hill itself cut away : 
otherwise the enemy may raise batteries within that distance without 
being exposed to a single shot from the fort. 

" Shingiss attended us to the Logstown, where we arrived between 
sun-setting and dark, the twenty-fifth day after I left Williamsburg. 
We travelled over some extremely good and bad land to get to this 
place. 

" As soon as I came into town, I went to Monacatoocha (as the 
Half-King was out at his hunting cabin on Little Beaver Creek, 
about fifteen miles off), and informed him by John Davidson, my 
Indian interpreter, that. I was sent a messenger to the French gene- 
ral ; and was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations to 
acquaint them with it. I gave him a string of wampum and a twist 
of tobacco, and desired him to send for the Half-King, which he 
promised to do by a runner in the morning, and for other sachems'. 
I invited him and the other great men present to my tent, where 
they stayed about an hour and returned. 

" According to the best observations I could make, Mr. Gist's new 
settlement (which we passed by) bears about west northwest seventy 
miles from Will's Creek ; Shannopins, or the Fork, north by west, or 
north northwest, about fifty miles from that ; and from thence to the 
Logstown, the course is nearly west about eighteen or twenty miles:

so that the whole distance, as we went and computed it, is at least 
one hundred and thirty-five or one hundred and forty miles from our 
back inhabitants. 

"25M. - Came to town four of ten Frenchmen, who had de- 
serted from a company at the Kuskuskas, which lies at the mouth of 
this river. I got the following account from them. They were sent 
from New Orleans with a hundred men and eight canoe-loads of 
provisions to this place, where they expected to have met the same 
number of men, from the forts on this side of Lake Erie, to convoy 
them and the stores up, who were not arrived when they ran off. 

" I inquired into the situation of the French on the Mississippi, 
their numbers, and what forts they had built. They informed me, 
that there were four small forts between New Orleans and the Black 
Islands, garrisoned with about thirty or forty men, and a few small 
pieces in each. That at New Orleans, which is near the mouth of 
the Mississippi, there are thirty-five companies of forty men each, 
with a pretty strong fort mounting eight carriage-guns; and at 1 the 
Black Islands there are several companies and a fort with six guns. 
The Black Islands are about a hundred and thirty leagues above the 
mouth of the Ohio, which is about three hundred and fifty above 
New Orleans. They also acquainted me, that there was a small 
palisadoed fort on the Ohio, at the mouth of the Obaish, about sixty 
leagues from the Mississippi. The Obaish heads near the west end 
of Lake Erie, and affords the communication between the French on 
the Mississippi and those on the lakes. These deserters came up 
from the lower Shannoah town with one Brown, an Indian trader, 
and were going to Philadelphia. 

" About three o'clock this evening the Half-King came to town. 
I went up and invited him wit]^ Davidson, privately, to my tent, and 
desired him to relate some of the particulars of his journey to the 
French commandant, and of his reception there ; also, to give me an 
account of the ways and distance. He told me, that the nearest and 
levelest way was now impassable, by reason of many large, miry sa 
vannas ; that we must be obliged to go by Venango, and should not 
get to the near fort in less than five or six nights' sleep, good travel* 
ling. When he went to the fort, he said he was received in a very 
stern manner by the late commander, who asked him very abruptly 
what he had come about, and to declare his business, which he said 
he did in the following speech. 

. " ' Fathers, I am come to tell you your own speeches, what 
your own mouths have declared. Fathers, you, in former days, set a 
silver basin before us, wherein there was the leg of a beaver, and de- 



.

sired all the nations to corne and eat of it, to eat in peace and plenty, 
and not to be churlish to one another ; and that if any such person 
should be found to be a disturber, I here lay down by the edge of the 
dish a rod, which you must scourge them with; and if your father 
should get foolish, in my old days, I desire you may use it upon me 
as well as others. 

" ' Now, fathers, it is you who are the disturbers in this land, by 
coming and building your towns, and taking it away unknown to us, 
and by force. 

" ' Fathers, we kindled a fire a long time ago, at a place called 
Montreal, where we desired you to stay, and not to come and intrude 
upon our land. I now desire you may despatch to that place ; for be 
it known to you, fathers, that this is our land and not yours. 

" ' Fathers, I desire you may hear me in civimess; if not, we must 
handle that rod which was laid down for the use of the obstreperous. 
If you had come in a peaceable manner, like our brothers the En- 
glish, we would not have been against your trading with us as they 
do; but to come, father?, and build houses upon our land, and to 
-ake it by force, is what we cannot submit to. 

" ' Fathers, both you and the English are white, we live in a coun- 
try between ; therefore, the land belongs to neither one nor the other. 
But the Great Being above allowed it to be a place of residence for 
us ; so, fathers, I desire you to withdraw, as I have done our brothers 
the English ; for I will keep you at arm's length. I lay this down as 
a trial for both, to see which will have the greatest regard to it, and 
that side we will stand by, and make equal sharers with us. Our 
brothers, the English, have heard this, and I come now to tell it to 
you ; for I am not afraid to discharge you off this land.' 

" This he said was the substance of what he spoke to the general, 
who made this reply. 

" ' Now, my child, I have heard your speech ; you spoke first, but 
it is my time to speak now. Where is my wampum that you took 
away, with the marks of towns on it 1 This wampum I do not know, 
which you have discharged me off the land with ; but you need not 
put yourself to the trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you. I am 
not afraid of flies or musquitoes, for Indians are such as those ; I tell 
you down that river I will go, and build upon it, according to my 
command. If the river was blocked up, I have forces sufficient to 
burst it open, and tread under my feet all that stand in opposition, 
together with their alliances ; for my force is as the sand upon the 
sea-shore ; therefore here is your wampum ; I sling it at you. Child, 
you talk foolish ; you say tin's land belongs to you, but there is not

the black of my nail yours. I saw that land sooner than you did, 
before the Shannoahs and you were at war ; Lead was the man who 
went down and took possession of that river. It is my land, and I 
will have it, let who will stand up for, or say against it. I will buy 
and sell with the English (mockingly). If people will be ruled by 
me, they may expect kindness, but not else.' 

" The Half-King told me he had inquired of the general after two 
Englishmen, who were made prisoners, and received this answer. 

" ' Child, you think it a very great hardship that I made prisoners 
of those two people at Venango. Don't you concern yourself with 
it ; we took and carried them to Canada, to get intelligence of what 
the English were doing in Virginia.' 

" He informed me, that they had built two forts, one on Lake 
Erie, and another on French Creek, near a small lake, about fifteen 
miles asunder, and a large wagon-road between. They are both 
built after the same model, but different in size ; that on the lake 
the largest. He gave me a plan of them of his own drawing. 

"The Indians inquired very particularly after their brothers in 
Carolina gaol. 

" They also asked what sort of a boy it was, who was taken from 
the South Branch ; for they were told by some Indians, that a party 
of French Indians had carried a white boy by Kuskuska Town, 
towards the lakes. 

" QQtli. We met in council at the long-house about nine o'clock, 
where I spoke to them as follows. 

" ' Brothers, I have called you together in council, by order of 
your brother, the Governor of Virginia, to acquaint you, that I am 
sent with all possible despatch, to visit and deliver a letter to the 
French commandant, of very great importance to your brothers, the 
English ; and I dare say to you, their friends and allies. 

" ' I was desired, brothers, by your brother, the Governor, to call 
upon you, the sachems of the nations, to inform you of it, and to ask 
your advice and assistance to proceed the nearest and best road to 
the French. You see, brothers, I have gotten thus far on my 
journey. 

" ' His Honor likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your 
young men to conduct and provide provisions for us on our way, and 
be a safeguard against those French Indians, who have taken up the 
hatchet against us. I have spoken thus particularly to you, brothers, 
because his Honor our Governor treats you as good friends and allies, 
and holds you in great esteem. To confirm what I have said, I give 
you this string of wampum.' 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 437 

" After they had considered for some time on the above discourse, 
the Half-King got up and spoke. 

' ' Now, my brother, in regard to what my brother, the Governor, 
had desired of me, I return you this answer. 

' ' I rely upon you as a brother ought to do, as you say we are 
brothers, and one people. We shall put heart in hand and speak to 
our fathers, the French, concerning the speech they made to me ; 
and you may depend that we will endeavour to be your guard. 

" ' Brother, as you have asked my advice, I hope you will be ruled 
by it, and stay until I can provide a company to go with you. The 
French speech-belt is not here ; I have to go for it to my hunting- 
cabin. Likewise, the people whom I have ordered in are not yet 
come, and cannot until the third night from this ; until which time, 
brother, I must beg you to stay. 

" ' I intend to send the guard of Mingoes, Shannoahs, and Dela- 
wares, that our brothers may see the love and loyalty we bear them.' 

" As I had orders to make all possible despatch, and waiting here 
was very contrary to my inclination, I thanked him in the most suit- 
able manner I could, and told him that my business required the 
greatest expedition, and would not admit of that delay. He was not 
well pleased that I should offer to go before the time he had ap- 
pointed, and told me, that he could not consent to our going without 
a guard, for fear some accident should befall us, and draw a reflection 
upon him. Besides, said he, this is a matter of no small moment, 
and must not be entered into without due consideration ; for I intend 
to deliver up the French speech-belt, and make the Shannoahs and 
Delawares do the same. And accordingly he gave orders to King 
Shingiss, who was present, to attend on Wednesday night with the 
wampum ; and two men of their nation to be in readiness to set out 
with us the next morning. As I found it was impossible to get off 
without affronting them in the most egregious manner, I consented 
to stay. 

" I gave them back a string of wampum, which I met with at 
Mr. Frazier s, and which they sent with a speech to his Honor the 
Governor, to inform him, that three nations of French Indians, 
namely, Chippewas, Ottowas, and Orundaks, had taken up the 
hatchet against the English ; and desired them to repeat it over again. 
But this they postponed doing until they met in full council with 
the Shannoah and Delaware chiefs. 

" 27^/t - - Runners were despatched very early for the Shannoah 
chiefs. The Half-King set out himself to fetch the French speech- 
belt from his hunting-cabin.

438 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



. He returned this evening, and came with Monacatoocha, 
and two other sachems to my tent; and begged (as they had com- 
plied with his Honor the Governor's request, in providing men, &c.) 
to know on what business we were going to the French. This was 
ii question I had all along expected, and had provided as satisfactory 
answers as I could ; which allayed their curiosity a little. 

" Monacatoocha informed me, that an Indian from Venangc 
brought news, a few days ago, that the French had called all thf 
Mingoes, Delawares, &-c. together at that place ; and told them, thai 
they intended to have been down the river this fall, but the watei 
were growing cold, and the winter advancing, which obliged them 
go into quarters ; but that they might assuredly expect them in tl 
spring, with a far greater number; and desired that they might 
quite passive, and not intermeddle unless they had a mind to dra\ 
all their force upon them ; for that they expected to fight the Eng- 
lish three years (as they supposed there would be some attempts 
made to stop them), in which time they should conquer. But that if 
they should prove equally strong, they and the English would join to 
cut them all off, and divide the land between them ; that though they 
had lost their general, and some few of their soldiers, yet there were 
men enough to reinforce them, and make them masters of the Ohio. 

" This speech, he said, was delivered to them by one Captain 
Joncaire, their interpreter in chief, living at Venango, and a man of 
note in the army. 

"29M. The Half-King and Monacatoocha came very early, and 
begged me to stay one day more ; for notwithstanding they had used 
all the diligence in their power, the Shannoah chiefs had not brought 
the wampum they ordered, but would certainly be in to-night ; if not, 
they would delay me no longer, but would send it after us as soon as 
they arrived. When I found them so pressing in their request, and 
knew that the returning of wampum was the abolishing of agreements, 
and giving this up was shaking off all dependence upon the French, 
I consented to stay, as I believed an offence offered at this crisis 
might be attended with greater ill consequence, than another day's 
delay. They also informed me, that Shingiss could not get in his 
men, and was prevented from coming himself by his wife's sickness, 
(I believe by fear of the French), but that the wampum of that na- 
tion was lodged with Kustalogo, one of their chiefs, at Venango. 

" In the evening, late, they came again, and acquainted me that 
the Shannoahs were not yet arrived, but that it should not retard the 
prosecution of our journey. He delivered in my hearing the speech 
that was to be made to the French by Jeskakake, one of their old 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 439 

chiefs, which was giving up the belt the late commandant had asked 
for, and repeating nearly the same speech he himself had done 
before. 

" He also delivered a string of wampum to this chief, which was 
sent by King Shingiss, to be given to Kustalogo, with orders to re- 
pair to the French, and deliver up the wampum. 

" He likewise gave a very large string of black and white wam- 
pum, which was to be sent up immediately to the Six Nations, 
if the French refused to quit the land at this warning ; which was 
the third and last time, and was the right of this Jeskakake to 
deliver. 

"30/j. Last night, the great men assembled at their council 
house, to consult further about this journey, and who were to go ; 
the result of which was, that only three of their chiefs, with one of 
their best hunters, should be our convoy. The reason they gave for 
not sending more, after what had been proposed at council the 26th, 
was, that a greater number might give the French suspicions of some 
bad design, and cause them to be treated rudely; but I rather think 
they could not get their hunters in. 

" We set out about nine o'clock with the Half-King, Jeskakake, 
White Thunder, and the Hunter; and travelled on the road to Ve- 
nango, where we arrived the 4th of December, without any thing 
remarkable happening but a continued series of bad weather. 

" This is an old Indian town, situated at the mouth of French 
Creek, on the Ohio; and lies near north about sixty miles from 
the Logstown, but more than seventy the way we were obliged to go. 

" We found the French colors hoisted at a house from which they 
had driven Mr. John Frazier, an English subject. I immediately re- 
paired to it, to know where the commander resided. There were 
three officers, one of whom, Captain Joncaire, informed me that he 
had the command of the Ohio ; but that there was a general officer 
at the near fort, where he advised me to apply for an answer. He 
invited us to sup with them, and treated us with the greatest com- 
plaisance. 

" The wine, as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully with it, 
soon banished the restraint which at first appeared in their conver- 
sation, and gave a license to their tongues to reveal their sentiments 
more freely. 

" They told me, that it was their absolute design to take possession 
of the Ohio, and by G they would do it ; for that, although they 
were sensible the English could raise two men for their one, yet they 
knew their motions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any under- 



440 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX 

taking of theirs. They pretend to have an undoubted right to the 
river from a discovery made by one La Salle, sixty years ago; and 
the rise of this expedition is, to prevent our settling on the river or 
waters of it, as they heard of some families moving out in order 
thereto. From the best intelligence I could get, there have been 
fifteen hundred men on this side Ontario Lake. But upon the death 
of the general, all were recalled to about six or seven hundred, who 
were left to garrison four forts, one hundred and fifty or thereabout in 
each. The first of them is on French Creek, near a small lake, 
about sixty miles from Venango, near north northwest ; the next lies 
on Lake Erie, where the greater part of their stores are kept, about 
fifteen miles from the other,; from this it is one hundred and twenty 
miles to the carrying-place, at the Falls of Lake Erie, where there is 
a small fort, at which they lodge their goods in bringing them from 
Montreal, the place from whence all their stores are brought. The 
next fort lies about twenty miles from this, on Ontario Lake. Be- 
tween this fort and Montreal, there are three others, the first of 
which is nearly opposite to the English fort Oswego. From the fort 
on Lake Erie to Montreal is about six hundred miles, which, they 
say, requires no more (if good weather) than four weeks' voyage, if 
they go in barks or large vessels, so that they may cross the lake ; 
but if they come in canoes, it will require five or six weeks, for they 
are obliged to keep under the shore. 

" December 5th. Rained excessively all day, which prevented our 
travelling. Captain Joncaire sent for the Half-King, as he had but 
just heard that he came with me. He affected to be much concerned 
that I did not make free to bring them in before. I excused it in 
the best manner of which I was capable, and told him, I did not 
think their company agreeable, as I had heard him say a good deal 
in dispraise of Indians in general ; but another motive prevented me 
from bringing them into his company ; I knew that he was an inter- 
preter, and a person of very great influence among the Indians, and 
had lately used all possible means to draw them over to his interest; 
therefore I was desirous of giving him no opportunity that could be 
avoided. 

" When they came in, there was great pleasure expressed at see- 
ing them. He wondered how they could be so near without coming 
to visit him, made several trifling presents, and applied liquor so fast, 
that they were soon rendered incapable of the business they came 
about, notwithstanding the caution which was given. 

"6th. The Half-King came to my tent, quite sober, and insisted 
very much that I should stay and hear what he had to say to the 



APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 441 

French. I fain would have prevented him from speaking any thing 
until he came to the commandant, but could rfot prevail. He told 
me, that at this place a council-fire was kindled, where all their 
business with these people was to be transacted, and that the man- 
agement of the Indian affairs was left solely to Monsieur Joncaire. 
As I was desirous of knowing the issue of this, I agreed to stay ; but 
sent our horses a little way up French Creek, to raft over and en- 
camp ; which I knew would make it near night. 

" About ten o'clock they met in council. The King spoke much 
the same as he had before done to the general ; and offered the 
French speech-belt which had before been demanded, with the 
marks of four towns on it, which Monsieur Joncaire refused to re- 
ceive, but desired him to carry it to the fort to the commander. 

"7th. Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, 
and three other soldiers, came over to accompany us up. We found 
it extremely difficult to get the Indians off to-day, as every stratagem 
had been used to prevent their going up with me. I had last night 
left John Davidson (the Indian interpreter), whom I brought with me 
from town, and strictly charged him not to be out of their company, 
as I could not get them over fo my tent ; for they had some business 
with Kustalogo, chiefly to know why he did not deliver up the French 
speech-belt which he had in keeping ; but I was obliged to send 
Mr. Gist over to-day to fetch them, which he did with great per- 
suasion. 

" At twelve o'clock, we set out for the fort, and were prevented ar- 
riving there until the llth by excessive rains, snows, and bad travel- 
ling through many mires and swamps ; these we were obliged to pass 
to avoid crossing the creek, which was impassable, either by fording 
or rafting, the water was so high and rapid. 

" We passed over much good land since we left Venango, and 
through several extensive and very rich meadows, one of which, I 
believe, was nearly four miles in length, and considerably wide in 
some places. 

" VZth. I prepared early to wait upon the commander, and was 
received and conducted to him by the second officer in command. I 
acquainted him with my business, and offered my commission and 
letter; both of which he desired me to keep until the arrival of Mon- 
sieur Reparti, captain at the next fort, who was sent for and ex- 
pected every hour. 

" This commander is a knight of the military order of St. Louis, 
and named Legardeur de St. Pierre. He is an elderly gentleman, 
and has much the air of a soldier. He was sent over to take the 

VOL. ii. 56 



442 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX, 

command immediately upon the death of the late general, and arrived 
here about seven days before me. 

" At two o'clock, the gentleman who was sent for arrived, when I 
offered the letter, &c. again, which they received, and adjourned 
into a private apartment for the captain to translate, who understood 
a little English. After he had done it, the commander desired I 
would walk in and bring my interpreter to peruse and correct it ; 
which I did. 

" 13th. The chief officers retired to hold a council of war, which 
gave me an opportunity of taking the dimensions of the fort, an 
making what observations I could. 

"It is situated on the south or west fork of French Creek, near the 
water ; and is almost surrounded by the creek, and a small branch 
of it, which form a kind of island. Four houses compose the sides. 
The bastions are made of piles driven into the ground, standing more 
than twelve feet above it, and sharp at top, with port-holes cut for 
cannon, and loop-holes for the small arms to fire through. There are 
eight six-pounds pieces mounted in each bastion, and one piece of 
four pounds before the gate. In the bastions are a guard-house, 
chapel, doctor's lodging, and the commander's private store ; round 
which are laid platforms for the cannon and men to stand on. 
There are several barracks without the fort, for the soldiers' dwel- 
lings, covered, some with bark, and some with boards, made chiefly 
of logs. There are also several other houses, such as stables, smith's 
shop, &c. 

" I could get no certain account of the number of men here ; but, 
according to the best judgment I could form, there are a hundred, ex- 
clusive of officers, of whom there are many. I also gave orders to 
the people who were with me, to take an exact account of the canoes, 
which were hauled up to convey their forces down in the spring. 
This they did, and told fifty of birch bark, and a hundred and sev- 
enty of pine ; besides many others, which were blocked out, in readi- 
ness for being made. 

" Ifah. As the snow increased very fast, and our horses daily 
became weaker, I sent them off unloaded, under the care of Barnaby 
Currin and two others, to make all convenient despatch to Venango, 
and there to wait our arrival, if there was a prospect of the river's 
freezing ; if not, then to continue down to Shannopin's Town, at the 
Fork of the Ohio, and there to wait until we came to cross the Alle- 
gany ; intending myself to go down by water, as I had the offer of a 
canoe or two. 

" As I found many plots concerted to retard the Indians' business, 




APPENDIX.] EARLY PAPERS. 443 

and prevent their returning with me, I endeavoured all that lay in 
my power to frustrate their schemes, and hurried them on to execute 
their intended design. They accordingly pressed for admittance 
this evening, which at length was granted them, privately, to the 
commander and one or two other officers. The Half-King told me, 
that he offered the wampum to the commander, who evaded taking 
it, and made many fair promises of love and friendship; said he 
wanted to live in peace and trade amicably with them, as a proof of 
which, he would send some goods immediately down to the Logs- 
town for them. But I rather think the design of that is to bring 
away all our straggling traders they meet with, as I privately un- 
derstood they intended to carry an officer, with them. And what 
rather confirms this opinion, I was inquiring of the commander by 
what authority he had made prisoners of several of our English sub- 
jects. He told me that the country belonged to them ; that no Eng- 
lishman had a right to trade upon those waters ; and that he had 
orders to make every person prisoner, who attempted it on the Ohio, 
or the waters of it. 

" I inquired of Captain Reparti about the boy, that was carried by 
this place, as it was done while the command devolved on him, be- 
tween the death .of the late general, and the arrival of the present. 
He acknowledged, that a boy had been carried past; and that the 
Indians had two or three white men's scalps (I was told by some of 
the Indians at Venango, eight), but pretended to have forgotten the 
name of the place where the boy came from, and all the particular 
facts, though he had questioned him for some hours, as they were 
carrying him past. I likewise inquired what they had done with John 
Trotter and James McClocklan, two Pennsylvania traders, whom 
they had taken with all their goods. They told me, that they had 
been sent to Canada, but were now returned home. 

" This evening I received an answer to his Honor the Governor 'a 
letter from the commandant. 

" 15f A. The commandant ordered a plentiful store of liquor, 
and provision to be put on board our canoes, and appeared to be 
extremely complaisant, though he was exerting every artifice, which 
he could invent, to set our Indians at variance with us, to prevent 
their going until after our departure ; presents, rewards, and every 
thing, which could be suggested by him or his officers. I cannot say 
that ever in my life I suffered so much anxiety, as I did in this affair. 
I saw that every stratagem, which the most fruitful brain could in- 
vent, was practised to win the Half-King to their interest; and that 
leaving him there was giving them the opportunity they aimed at. I

went to the Half-King and pressed him in the strongest terms to go ; 
he told me that the commandant would not discharge him until the 
morning. I then went to the commandant, and desired him to do 
their business, and complained of ill treatment ; for keeping thei 
as they were part of my company, was detaining me. This he prom- 
ised not to do, but to forward my journey as much as he could. He 
protested he did not keep them, but was ignorant of the cause of 
their stay ; though I soon found it out. He had promised them a 
present of guns, if they would wait until the morning. As I was 
very much pressed by the Indians to wait this day for them, I 
consented, on a promise that nothing should hinder them in the 
morning. 

" 16th. The French were not slack in their inventions to keep 
the Indians this day also. But as they were obliged, according to 
promise, to give the present, they then endeavoured to try the power 
of liquor, which I doubt not would have prevailed at any other time 
than this ; but I urged and insisted with the King so closely upon his 
word, that he refrained, and set off with us as he had engaged. 

" We had a tedious and very fatiguing passage down the creek. 
Several times we had like to have been staved against rocks ; and 
many times were obliged all hands to get out and remain in the 
water half an hour or more, getting over the shoals. At one place, 
the ice had lodged, and made it impassable by water ; we were, 
therefore, obliged to carry our canoe across the neck of land, a quar- 
ter of a mile over. We did not reach Venango until the 22d, where 
we met with our horses. 

" This creek is extremely crooked. I dare say the distance be- 
tween the fort and Venango cannot be less than one hundred and 
thirty miles, to follow the meanders. 

"23c?. When I got things ready to set off, I sent for the Half- 
King, to know whether he intended to go with us or by water. He 
told me that White Thunder had hurt himself much, and was sick, 
and unable to walk ; therefore he was obliged to carry him down in 
a canoe. As I found he intended to stay here a day or two, and 
knew that Monsieur Joncaire would employ every scheme to set him 
against the English, as he had before done, I told him, I hoped he 
would guard against his flattery, and let no fine speeches influence 
him in their favor. He desired I might not be concerned, for he 
knew the French too well, for any thing to engage him in their favor; 
and that though he could not go down with us, he yet would endeav- 
our to meet at the Fork with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a speech 
for me to carry to his Honor the Governor. He told me he would

order the Young Hunter to attend us, and get provisions, &/c if 
wanted. 

" Our horses were now so weak and feeble, and the baggage so 
heavy (as we were obliged to provide all the necessaries which the 
journey would require), that we doubted much their performing it. 
Therefore, myself and others, except the drivers, who were obliged 
to ride, gave up our horses for packs, to assist along with the bag- 
gage. I put myself in an Indian walking-dress, and continued with 
them three days, until I found there was no probability of their get- 
ting home in any reasonable time. The horses became less able to 
travel every day ; the cold increased very fast ; and the roads were 
becoming much worse by a deep snow, continually freezing ; there- 
fore, as I was uneasy to get back, to make report of my proceedings 
to his Honor the Governor, I determined to prosecute my journey, the 
nearest way through the woods, on foot. 

" Accordingly, I left Mr. Vanbraam in charge of our baggage, 
with money and directions to provide necessaries from place to place 
for themselves and horses, and to make the most convenient despatch 
in travelling. 

"I took my necessary papers, pulled off my clothes, and tied myself 
up in a match-coat. Then, with gun in hand, and pack on my back, 
in which were my papers and provisions, I set out with Mr. Gist, 
fitted in the same manner, on Wednesday the 26th. The day fol- 
lowing, just after we had passed a place called Murdering Town 
(where we intended to quit the path and steer across the country for 
Shannopin's Town), we fell in with a party of French Indians, who 
had lain in wait for us. One of them fired at Mr. Gist or me, not 
fifteen steps off, but fortunately missed. We took this fellow into 
custody, and kept him until about nine o'clock at night, then let him 
go, and walked all the remaining part of the night without making 
any stop, that we might get the start so far, as to be out of the reach 
of their pursuit the next day, since we were well assured they would 
follow our track as soon as it was light. The next day we continued 
travelling until quite dark, and got to the river about two miles above 
Shannopin's. We expected to have found the river frozen, but it was 
not, only about fifty yards from each shore. The ice, I suppose, had 
broken up above, for it was driving in vast quantities. 

" There was no way for getting over but on a raft, which we set 
about, witli but one poor hatchet, and finished just after sun-setting. 
This was a whole day's work ; we next got it launched, then went on 
board of it, and set off; but before we were halfway over, we were 
jammed in the ice in such a manner, that we expected every moment

our raft to sink, and ourselves to perish. I put out my setting-pole to 
try to stop the raft, that the ice might pass by, when the rapidity of 
the stream threw it with so much violence against the pole, that it 
jerked me out into ten feet water ; but I fortunately saved myself by 
catching hold of one of the raft-logs. Notwithstanding all our ef- 
forts, we could not get to either shore, but were obliged, as we were 
near an island, to quit our raft and make to it. 

" The cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist had all his fin- 
gers and some of his toes frozen, and the water was shut up so hard, 
that we found no difficulty in getting off the island on the ice in the 
morning, and went to Mr. Frazier's. We met here with twenty 
warriors, who were going to the southward to war ; but coming to a 
place on the head of the Great Kenhawa, where they found seven 
people killed and scalped (all but one woman with very light hair), 
they turned about and ran back, for fear the inhabitants should rise 
and take them as the authors of the murder. They report that the 
bodies were lying about the house, and some of them much torn and 
eaten by the hogs. By the marks which were left, they say they 
were French Indians of the Ottoway nation, who did it. 

" As we intended to take horses here, and it required some time to 
find them, I went up about three miles to the mouth of Youghiogany, 
to visit Queen Aliquippa, who had expressed great concern that we 
passed her in going to the fort. I made her a present of a watch- 
coat and a bottle of rum, which latter was thought much the better 
present of the two. 

" Tuesday, the 1st of January, we left Mr. Frazier's house, and ar- 
rived at Mr. Gist's, at Monongahela, the 2d, where I bought a horse 
and saddle. The 6th, we met seventeen horses loaded with mate- 
rials and stores for a fort at the Fork of the Ohio, and the day after, 
some families going out to settle. This day, we arrived at Will's 
Creek, after as fatiguing a journey as it is possible to conceive, ren- 
dered so by excessive bad weather. From the 1st day of December 
to the 15th, there was but one day on which it did not rain or snow 
incessantly ; and throughout the whole journey, we met with nothing 
but one continued series of cold, wet weather, which occasioned very 
uncomfortable lodgings, especially after we had quitted our tent, 
which was some screen from the inclemency of it. 

" On the llth, I got to Belvoir, where I stopped one day to take 
necessary rest ; and then set out and arrived in Williamsburg the 
16th, when I waited upon his Honor the Governor, with the letter I 
had brought from the French commandant, and to give an account 
of the success of my proceedings. This I beg leave to do by offerin.

the foregoing narrative, as it contains the most remarkable occur- 
rences, which happened in my journey. 

" I hope what has been said will be sufficient to make your Honor 
satisfied with my conduct ; for that was my aim in undertaking the 
journey, and chief study throughout the prosecution of it." 



No. II. p. 39. 
. DEATH OF JUMONVILLE. 

The circumstances attending the death of Jumonville have been 
so remarkably misunderstood and perverted by the French historians, 
and the character of Washington, in regard to this event, has suf- 
fered so much in their hands, that the subject demands a further 
consideration. The following extracts, from three of the most recent 
and accredited French writers, will show in what light this point of 
history is still viewed by that nation. The first extract is from Flas- 
san, whose history holds a high rank in French literature, and was 
written with the approbation of Napoleon, if not in consequence of his 
suggestion. 

" M. de Jumonville," says Flassan, " setting off with an escort of 
thirty men, found himself surrounded in the morning by a body of 
English and savages. The former fired twice in rapid succession, 
and killed several Frenchmen. Jumonville made a sign, that he was 
the bearer of a letter from his commandant. The fire ceased, and 
they gathered around him tp hear the letter. He caused the sum- 
mons to be read, but the reading was not finished when the English 
reiterated their fire and killed him. The remaining Frenchmen of 
his escort were immediately made prisoners of war." * 

The next extract is from Lacretelle, whose history likewise enjoys 
a distinguished reputation in his native country. 

" An officer, by the name of Jumonville, was sent with an escort 
of thirty men. The English, ranged in a circle around him, listened 
to the representations, which he came to make. Had they premedi- 
tated so atrocious a crime ? Were they moved by a sudden impulse of 
hatred and ferocity 1 This cannot now be known ; but they disgraced 
the New World by an outrage never before heard of among civilized

' 
people, and which excited the savages to a transport of indignation. 

They assassinated Jumonville, and immolated eight soldiers, who fell 
bleeding by the side of their chief. They made prisoners of the rest 
of the escort." 

To this passage M. Lacretelle adds the following note. 

" It is painful to state, that the detachment of the English, who 
committed this atrocity, was commanded by Washington. This offi- 
cer, who afterwards displayed the purest virtues of the warrior, the 
citizen, and the sage, was then no more than twenty-two years old. 
lie could not restrain the wild and undisciplined troops, who 
marched under his orders." * 

Montgaillard, another French historian, who has sketched with 
great ability and eloquence, in the form of annals, the events of the 
French Revolution, thus speaks of Washington, after quoting the 
elegant tribute to his memory by Mallet-Dupan. 

" This great man, the only person with whom no other in modern 
history can be compared, would have enjoyed a renown without re- 
proach, his public career would have been without fault, his glory 
would have shone with an unsullied lustre, had it not been for the 
fatal event of the death of Jumonville, a young officer sent to him 
with a summons by the commandant of the French establishments on 
the Ohio. Washington, then a major in the forces of the King of 
England, commanded the post, which assassinated Jumonville. He 
was then twenty-three [twenty-two] years of age. Far from offering 
any reparation, himself attacked by the brother of Jumonville, and 
made prisoner with his troops, he received his life and liberty on the 
condition of sending back the Frenchmen, who escaped from the mas- 
sacre ; yet he violated his promise. The French could never efface 
the remembrance of this deplorable circumstance, whatever venera 
tion the political life of this illustrious citizen might have merited." t 

Many other French historians might be cited, who make the same 
statements, in almost the same words ; and even very recently the 
writer of a life of Washington in the Biographic Universelle, who 
aims apparently to be accurate and impartial, and who has done jus- 
tice for the most part to Washington's character, repeats this story 
of the assassination of Jumonville, adding, like Lacretelle, as the only 
extenuating circumstances, the youth of Washington, and the ungov- 
ernable ferocity of his soldiers.

APPENDIX.] DEATH OF JUMONVILLE. 449 

It will be seen, by comparing the above extracts, that they are in 
substance precisely the same, and must unquestionably have been de- 
rived from a common source. Every thing will depend on the degree 
of credit, that is due to this single authority, upon which alone all the 
accounts of subsequent writers are founded. A supposed fact is not 
strengthened by the repetition of one historian from another, what- 
ever merit each writer may have on the score of talents and honest 
intentions. All history is built on evidence, and if this is fallacious, 
or partial, or dubious, the deductions from it must be equally uncer- 
tain and deceptive. Of this obvious position the present instance 
affords a remarkable illustration. 

The authority, from which all the French historians have drawn 
their intelligence, is a letter written by M. de Contrecoeur to the 
Marquis Duquesne, at that time governor of Canada. This letter is 
dated June 2d, 1754. The following is a literal translation of the 
part, which relates to the subject in question. 

" Since the letter, which I had the honor of writing to you on the 
30th ultimo, in which I informed you, that I expected the return of 
M. de Jumonville in four days, it has been reported by the savages, 
that his party has been taken, and eight men killed, among whom is 
M. de Jumonville. A Canadian belonging to the party, named 
Mouceau, made his escape, who relates, that they had built cabins in 
a low bottom, where they lay during a heavy rain. At seven o'clock 
in the morning, they saw themselves encircled on one side by the 
English, and by savages on the other. Two discharges of mus- 
ketry were fired upon them by the English, but none by the sav- 
ages. M. de Jumonville called to them by an interpreter to desist, 
as he had something to say to them. The firing ceased. M. de 
Jumonville caused the summons to be read, which I had sent, ad- 
monishing them to retire, a copy of which I have the honor to en- 
close. Whilst this was reading, the said Mouceau saw the French 
gathered close around M. de Jumonville, in the midst of the English 
and the savages. At that time Mouceau escaped through the woods, 
making his way hither partly by land, and partly in a small canoe on 
the river Monongahela. 

" This, Sir, is all that I have been able to learn from Mouceau. 
The misfortune is, that our people were taken by surprise. The 
English had surrounded and come upon them before they were seen. 

" I have this moment received a letter from M. de Chauvignerie, 
which I have the honor to send you herewith, from which you will 
see, that we have certainly lost eight men, of whom M. de Jumon- 
ville is one. The savages, who were present, say, that M. de Jumon- 

VOL. II. 57 LL * i 



450 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

ville was killed by a musket-shot in the head, while he was listening 
to the reading of the summons, and that the English would im- 
mediately have destroyed the whole party, if the savages had not 
rushed in before them and prevented their attempt. M. Drouillon 
and M. de la Force were made prisoners. We are not informed 
whether M. de Boucherville and M. du Sable, two cadets, are among 
the slain. Such is the account, which we have received from the 
savages." * 

Here we have all the particulars, as they appear in the citations 
from the French historians, and almost in the same language. And 
this is the original and sole authority, from which have been derived 
all the succeeding French accounts of the conflict between the forces 
of Washington and Jumonville, which terminated so fatally to the 
latter. By what testimony is this statement of M. de Contreco3ur 
sustained ? First, by the report of a Canadian, who fled affrighted 
at the beginning of the action ; and, next, by the vague rumors 
of the savages, who were said to have been on the spot. These 
savages, if any there were, who returned to M. de Contrecoeur, must 
have come out with the French party. No such savages are men- 
tioned as being seen by the English; and consequently, if there were 
any originally with the party, they escaped, like the Canadian, at the 
beginning of the action, and could have had no knowledge of the 
manner in which it was conducted. In any other case would such 
testimony be taken as evidence of facts 1 It can certainly have no 
claim to be made the basis of a historical narrative. Much less can 
it warrant severe censures upon the character of an officer, who was 
in reality discharging his duty in the execution of his orders. 

In the year 1759, five years after these events, M. Thomas pub- 
dished his epic in four cantos, entitled " JUMONVILLE," founded on 
the incidents real and imaginary of the skirmish, in which his hero 
fell, and of the attack of M. de Villiers upon Fort Necessity, which 
soon followed. He states the subject of his poem to be, " L' Assctssinat 
de M. de Jumonville en Amerique, et la Vengeance de ce Meurtre." It 
is written with extreme warmth of patriotic passion throughout, and 
Zimmerman, in his treatise on NATIONAL PRIDE, cites the " Jumon- 
ville" of Thomas, as a remarkable instance of the effect of national 
antipathy. The preface contains an exaggerated paraphrase of 
M. de Contrecoeur's letter, as the groundwork of the author's poeti- 
cal fabric. With the materials thus furnished, and with the ma- 
chinery of the deep and wild forests, the savages, the demon of

APPENDIX.] DEATH OF JUMON VILLE. 451 

battles, and the ghost of Jumonville, his epic speedily assumes a 
tragic garb, and the scenes of horror and cries of vengeance cease 
not till the poem closes. The general merits of this piece, as a po- 
etical composition, and the high character of M. Thomas as a man 
of letters, gave it a currency in the literary world, which had the ef- 
fect of perpetuating the impressions then received, and so far of bias- 
ing prevalent opinions, as to prevent that cautious examination into 
facts, which is the first duty of a faithful historian. 

The official letters of Washington, now for the first time published, 
and also the manuscript letters of Governor Dinwiddie, throw much 
additional light upon this subject, and afford the means for drawing 
up the following accurate statement of all the essential particulars. 

When the news of the capitulation of Ensign Ward to the French 
on the Ohio, in consequence of a military summons, reached Will's 
Creek, where the Virginia troops were encamped, Colonel Washing- 
ton considered the frontiers to be actually invaded, and that, in com- 
pliance with the tenor of his orders, it was his duty to march forward 
and be prepared to meet the invading forces wherever they should 
present themselves. A council of war was immediately held, by 
which this opinion was confirmed, and it was resolved to proceed to 
the junction of Red-stone Creek with the Monongahela, thirty-seven 
miles from the fort captured by the French, construct such a fortifi- 
cation there, as circumstances would permit, and wait for reinforce- 
ments. On the 1st of May the little army, amounting to one hundred 
and fifty men, set off from Will's Creek, and advanced by slow and 
tedious marches into the wilderness. The Indians brought in fre- 
quent reports of their having seen French scouts in the woods, and 
on the 24th of May the Half-King sent a message to Washington, 
apprizing him, that a French force, in what numbers he could not 
tell, was on its march to attack the English wherever they should be 
found, and warning him to be on his guard. He was now a few 
miles beyond the Great Meadows, and on receiving this intelligence 
he hastened back to that place, and threw up an entrenchment, de- 
termined to wait there the approach of the enemy, whom he supposed 
to be coming out with a hostile intention. 

Early in the morning of the 27th, Mr. Gist arrived in camp from 
his residence, which was about thirteen miles distant, and informed 
Colonel Washington, that M. La Force with fifty men had been at 
his plantation the day before, and that on his way he had seen the 
tracks of the same party five miles from the encampment at the 
Great Meadows. Seventy-five men were immediately despatched in 
pursuit of this party, but they returned without having discovered it 



452 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

Between eight and nine o'clock the same night an express arrived 
from the Half-King, who was then six miles off, with intelligence 
that he had seen the tracks of two Frenchmen, which had been 
traced to an obscure retreat, and that he imagined the whole party 
to be concealed within a short distance. Fearing this might be a 
stratagem of the French for attacking his camp, Colonel Washington 
put his ammunition in a place of safety, and, leaving a strong guard 
to protect it, he set out with forty men, and reached the Indians' 
camp a little before sunrise, having marched through a rainy and ex- 
ceedingly dark night. 

On counselling with the Half-King, and the other Indians of his 
party, it was agreed, that they should march together and make the 
attack in concert on the French. They then proceeded in single 
file through the woods, after the manner of the Indians, till they 
came upon the tracks of the two Frenchmen, when the Half-King 
sent two Indians forward to retrace these tracks, and discover the 
position of the main body. This was found to be in a very retired 
place surrounded by rocks, and half a mile from the road. A dispo- 
sition for attack was then formed, in which the English occupied the 
right wing and the Indians the left. In this manner they advanced, 
till they came so near as to be discovered by the French, who in- 
stantly ran to their arms. Washington then ordered his men to fire, 
and a skirmish ensued. The firing continued on both sides about 
fifteen minutes, till the French were defeated, with the loss of their 
whole party, ten men being killed, including their commander, 
M . de Jumonville, one wounded, and twenty-one taken prisoners. 
Colonel Washington's loss was one man killed, and two or three 
wounded. The Indians escaped without injury, as the firing of the 
French was directed chiefly against the right wing, where Washing- 
ton and his men were stationed. 

This is a brief and simple narrative of facts, drawn from Washing- 
ton's official letters written at the time, and from the account trans- 
mitted by Governor Dinwiddie to the British ministry, which are 
both confirmed by the extracts from Washington's private journal pub- 
lished by the French government. It is worthy of remark, that this 
journal, kept for his own private use, and captured the year following 
by the French at Braddock's defeat, accords in every essential point 
with his public communications to Governor Dinwiddie. Is not this 
accordance an irrefragable proof of the fidelity of his statement, even 
if his character permitted us to demand any other proof, than his 
single declaration? Were it possible for him to give a deceptive 
coloring to his public despatches, yet there could be no conceivable 



APPENDIX.] DEATH OF JUMONVILLE. 453 

inducement for recording such deceptions among the broken minutes 
of his daily transactions, which were intended for no eye but his own. 

Let it now be -asked, what ground there can be for calling the 
death of Jumonville in this skirmish an assassination, or affixing to 
it the stigma of a crime, with which it has been marked by the 
French historians? Is this' charge authorized either by the act itself, 
or by the nature of the causes, which led to it ? 

As to the act itself, it differs in no respect from that of any other 
commander, who leads his men into an engagement, in which some 
of the enemy are slain. It was a conflict into which both parties 
entered, with such means of annoyance as they could command. 
One of Washington's men was killed by the French, and others were 
wounded. There would be just as much justice in calling the death 
of this man an assassination, as that of M. de Jumonville. It is true, 
as M. de Contrecoeur wrote to the Marquis Duquesne, that Washing- 
ton came upon the French by surprise ; but this circumstance, so far 
from being a matter of censure, is not only considered allowable 
among the stratagems of honorable warfare, but an object of praise in 
the commander who effects it with success. The report of the Cana- 
dian, that the reading of the summons was begun by M. de Ju- 
monville's order, and of the savages, that he was killed while the 
interpreter was reading it, are manifestly fictions, as these incidents 
are nowhere else mentioned. Some of the prisoners said, after they 
were taken, that, when the firing commenced, the French called out 
to the English, with the design to make known the object of their 
mission, and the purport of the summons brought by M. de Jumon- 
ville. This was not told to Washington by the prisoners, nor was he 
informed of it till after their departure. He wrote to the Governor, 
however, stating that he had heard such a report, and affirming it to 
be false. The same particulars and the same affirmation were entered 
in his journal. As he was at the head of his men, and the first per- 
son seen by the French, he believed it impossible that any such call 
should have been made without his hearing it, which was not the 
case, but, on the contrary, he saw them run to their arms and they 
immediately commenced firing. 

In regard to the causes, which led to the attack, it has been pre- 
sumed by the French writers, that hostilities had not been committed, 
and that war did not in reality exist. Without discussing the abstract 
merits of the question, it is certain that the Governor and people of 
Virginia looked upon the frontiers as at that time in a state of war, 
and supposed it lawful to repel by force the French, and Indians in 
league with them, wherever found. M. de Contrecoeur had ctppeared 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



with an army before the fort on the Ohio, which was held by a party 
of Virginia troops, had drawn up his cannon in a menacing attitude, 
demanded a surrender, and threatened to take forcible possession in 
case his demand was disregarded. Compelled by this threat, the 
chief officer of the fort had capitulated. This act, on the part of the 
French commander, was considered as the beginning of an open war. 
Governor Dinwiddie, alluding to this subject in writing to the Gover- 
nor of South Carolina, says, " I think there can be no greater act of 
hostility, than taking a fort begun to be built by his Majesty's imme- 
diate commands, and this must be esteemed the first breach from the 
French ; and what followed in taking some of their people prisoners, 
and killing others, was in consequence thereof." In his message to 
the House of Burgesses of Virginia, August 23d, 1754, the Governor 
also says, " In open contempt and violation of the treaties now sub- 
sisting between the crowns of Great Britain and France, they have 
unjustly invaded his Majesty's lands on the river Ohio, and with an 
armed force taken a fort, that by his Majesty's orders I had directed 
to be built on that river." It is moreover certain, that Colonel 
Washington acted in strict conformity with the orders he had re- 
ceived ; for the Governor approved his conduct both in writing to the 
ministry in England, and to M. Drouillon, one of the prisoners, who 
complained of his detention. It must be inferred, therefore, that, 
whatever may be the political aspect of this question, as concerning 
the relations between France and England, Washington was in no 
degree censurable for the course he pursued, but on the contrary 
was engaged in the discharge of his duty, by acting in strict obedi- 
ence to the will and directions of the government of Virginia, under 
whose authority he held his commission. 

The representations of the French prisoners, that Jumonville's de- 
tachment did not come out in a military capacity, but merely to bring 
a civil message, or summons, is well answered in Washington's let- 
ters to the Governor of Virginia. The same reasoning is used by 
the Governor himself in his reply to M. Drouillon, who made to him 
similar representations after he reached Winchester. 

" The protection due to messengers of peace," says Governor Din- 
widdie, " is so universally acknowledged, and the sacredness of their 
character so inviolably preserved, that even among the most barbarous 
nations their persons are safe and unhurt. You cannot be ignorant 
how much all the various tribes of Indians revere the calumet, and 
you must know, that a flag of truce would sooner have induced our 
protection and regard, than a body of men armed with the instru- 
ments of destruction. Thus I think the inconsistency of your ap- 




APPENDIX.] DEATH OF JUMON V1LLE. 455 

pearance with your pretensions obliges me to consider you in no 
other light, than that in which you presented yourselves. You re- 
mained several days about our camp without telling your message, 
nor would you do it till you were prepared for our destruction. You 
had neither a right to demand, nor Colonel Washington to discuss, 
the King my master's title to the land on the Ohio River. Such a 
disquisition lay only with your superiors. But it was his duty to 
preserve his Majesty's dominions in peace, and protect his subjects ; 
and they, who attempt the violation of either, must acknowledge the 
justice of their fate, if they meet with destruction. Colonel Wash- 
ington assures me of the contrary to what you represent, regarding 
the circumstances of the action ; and after it, the papers of summons 
and instructions to the Sieur Jumonville are incontestable proofs and 
justifications of his conduct, and laid him under the necessity of con- 
tinuing to act as he afterwards did." 

Again, alluding to this subject, Governor Dinwiddie writes to Lord 
Albemarle; "The prisoners said they were come on an embassy 
from their fort ; but your Lordship knows, that ambassadors do not 
come with such an armed force, without a trumpet, or any other sign 
of friendship ; nor can it be thought they were on an embassy, by 
staying so long reconnoitring our small camp, but more probably, 
that they expected a reinforcement from their fort to cut them all off." 

It may not be possible to ascertain at this time the precise object, 
for which the party under Jumonville was sent out. The tenor of 
his instructions, and the manner in which he approached Colonel 
Washington's camp, make it evident enough that he deviated widely 
from the mode usually adopted in conveying a summons ; and his con- 
duct was unquestionably such, as to create just suspicions, if not to 
afford a demonstration, of his hostile designs. His appearance on the 
route at the head of an armed force, his subsequent concealment at a 
distance from the road, his remaining there for nearly two days, his 
sending off messengers to M. de Contrecosur, were all circumstances 
unfavorable to a pacific purpose. If he came really as a peaceful 
messenger, and if any fault was committed by the attack upon him, 
it must be ascribed to his own imprudence and injudicious mode of 
conducting his enterprise, and not to any deviation from strict mili- 
tary rules on the part of Colonel Washington, who did no more than 
execute the duty of a vigilant officer, for which he received the un- 
qualified approbation of his superiors and of the public.

BATTLE OF THE GREAT MEADOWS. 

When the council of war was held at Gist's plantation, on the in- 
telligence being received that the French at Fort Duquesne were re- 
inforced, and would speedily march against the English, it was re- 
holved to send an express to Captain Mackay, then at the Great 
Meadows, desiring him to join Colonel Washington with his Inde- 
pendent Company of South Carolinians, and also to call in Captain 
Lewis and Captain Poison, who were out with separate detachments. 
Captain Mackay arrived at camp in the evening, and the two detach- 
ments the next morning, when another council of war was convened, 
and it was unanimously resolved to retreat. A good deal of labor 
had been expended at Gist's in throwing up intrenchments, with the 
intention of waiting the approach of the French at that place, but the 
news of their increased numbers rendered this an inexpedient 
measure. 

Preparations for a retreat commenced immediately. The horses 
were few, and Colonel Washington set a noble example to the officers 
by lading his own horse with ammunition and other public stores, 
leaving his baggage behind, and giving the soldiers four pistoles to 
carry it forward. The other officers followed this example. There 
were nine swivels, which were drawn by the soldiers of the Virginia 
regiment over a very broken road, unassisted by the men belonging to 
the Independent Company, who refused to perform any service of 
this kind. Nor would they act as pioneers, nor aid in transporting 
the public stores, considering this a duty not incumbent on them as 
King's soldiers. This conduct had a discouraging effect upon the 
soldiers of the Virginia regiment, by damping their ardor, and 
making them more dissatisfied with their extreme fatigue ; but the 
whole party reached the Great Meadows on the 1st of July. 

It was not the intention of Colonel Washington at first to halt at 
this place, but his men had become so much fatigued from great 
labor, and a deficiency of provisions, that they could draw the swivels 
no further, nor carry the baggage on their backs. They had been 
eight days without bread, and at the Great Meadows they found only 
a few bags of flour. It was thought advisable to wait here, therefore, 
and fortify themselves in the best manner they could, till they should 
receive supplies and reinforcements. They had heard of the arrival 
at Alexandria of two Independent Companies from New York twenty 






APPENDIX.] THE GREAT MEADOWS. 457 

days before, and it was presumed they must by this time have reached 
Will's Creek. An express was sent to hasten them on, with as much 
despatch as possible. 

Meantime Colonel Washington set his men to felling trees, and 
carrying logs to the fort, with a view to raise a breastwork, and en- 
large and strengthen the fortification in the best manner, that cir- 
cumstances would permit. The space of ground, called the Great 
Meadows, is a level bottom, through which passes a small creek, and 
is surrounded by hills of a moderate and gradual ascent. This bot- 
tom, or glade, is entirely level, covered with long grass and small 
bushes, and varies in width. At the point where the fort stood, it is 
about two hundred and fifty yards wide, from the base of one hill to 
that of the opposite. The position of the fort was well chosen, being 
about one hundred yards from the upland, or wooded ground, on the 
one side, and one hundred and fifty on the other, and so situated on 
the margin of the creek, as to afford an easy access to water. At 
one point the high ground comes within sixty yards of the fort, and 
this was the nearest distance to which an enemy could approach un- 
der the shelter of trees. The outlines of the fort were still visible, 
when the spot was visited by the writer in 1830, occupying an irreg- 
ular square, the dimensions of which were about one hundred feet on 
each side. One of the angles was prolonged further than the others, 
for the purpose of reaching the water in the creek. On the west 
side, next to the nearest wood, were three entrances, protected by 
short breastworks, or bastions. The remains of a ditch, stretching 
round the south and west sides, were also distinctly seen. The site 
of this fort, named Fort Necessity from the circumstances attending 
its erection and original use, is three or four hundred yards south of 
what is now called the National Road, four miles from the foot of 
Laurel Hill, and fifty miles from Cumberland at Will's Creek. 

On the 3d of July early in the morning an alarm was received 
from a sentinel, who had been wounded by the enemy ; and at nine 
o'clock intelligence came, that the whole body of the enemy, amount- 
ing, as was reported, to nine hundred men, was only four miles off. 
At eleven o'clock they approached the fort, and began to fire, at the 
distance of six hundred yards, but without effect. Colonel Washing- 
ton had drawn up his men on the open and level ground outside of 
the trenches, waiting for the attack, which he presumed would be 
made as soon as the enemy's forces emerged from the woods ; and he 
ordered his men to reserve their fire, till they should be near enough 
to do execution. The distant firing was supposed to be a stratagem 
to draw Washington's men into the woods, and thus to take them at 

VOL. II. 58 MM 



458 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



a disadvantage. He suspected the design, and maintained his post 
till he found the French did not incline to leave the woods, and at- 
tack the fort by an assault, as he supposed they would, considering 
their superiority of numbers. He then drew, his men back within 
the trenches, and gave them oiders to fire according to their dis- 
cretion, as suitable opportunities might present themselves. The 
French and Indians remained on the side of the rising ground, whicl 
was nearest to the fort, and, sheltered by the trees, kept up a brisl 
fire of musketry, but never appeared in the open plain below. The 
rain fell heavily through the day, the trenches were filled with water 
and many of the arms of Colonel Washington's men were out 
order, and used with difficulty. 

In this way the battle continued from eleven o'clock in the mor 
ing till eight at night, when the French called and requested a pj 
ley. Suspecting this to be a feint to procure the admission of an 
officer into the fort, that he might discover their condition, Colonel 
Washington at first declined listening to the proposal, but when the 
call was repeated, with the additional request that an officer might be 
sent to them, engaging at the same time their parole for his safety, 
he sent out Captain Vanbraam, the only person under his command, 
that could speak French, except the Chevalier de Peyrouny, an en- 
sign in the Virginia regiment, who was dangerously wounded, and 
disabled from rendering any service on this occasion. Vanbraam 
returned, and brought with him from M. de Villiers, the French 
commander, proposed articles of capitulation. These he read and 
pretended to interpret, and, some changes having been made by mu- 
tual agreement, both parties signed them about midnight. 

By the terms of the capitulation, the whole garrison was to retire, 
and return without molestation to the inhabited parts of the country, 
and the French commander promised, that no embarrassment should 
be interposed, either by his own men or the savages. The English 
were to take away every thing in their possession, except their artil- 
lery, and to march out of the fort the next morning with the honors 
of war, their drums beating and colors flying. As the French had 
killed all the horses and cattle, Colonel Washington had no means 
of transporting his heavy baggage and stores ; and it was conceded 
to him, that his men might conceal their effects, and that a guard 
might be left to protect them, till horses could be sent up to take 
them away. Colonel Washington agreed to restore the prisoners, 
who had been taken at the skirmish with Jumonville ; and as a surety 
for this article two hostages, Captain Vanbraam and Captain Stobo, 
were delivered up to the French, and were to be retained till the pris- 



APPENDIX.] THE GREAT MEADOWS. 

oners should return. It was moreover agreed, that the party capitu- 
lating should not attempt to build any more establishments at that 
place, or beyond the mountains, for the space of a year. 

Early the next morning Colonel Washington began to march from 
the fort in good order, but hehad proceeded only a short distance, 
when a body of one hundred Indians, being a reinforcement to the 
French, came upon him, and could hardly be restrained from attack- 
ing his men. They pilfered the baggage and did other mischief. 
He marched forward, however, with as much speed as possible, in 
the weakened and encumbered condition of his army, there being no 
other mode of conveying the wounded men and the baggage, than on 
the soldiers' backs. As the provisions were nearly exhausted, no 
time was to be lost ; and, leaving much of the baggage behind, he 
hastened to Will's Creek, where all the necessary supplies were in 
store. Thence Colonel Washington arid Captain Mackay proceeded 
to Williamsburg, and communicated in person to the Governor the 
events of the campaign. * 

A good deal of dissatisfaction was expressed with some of the arti- 
cles of capitulation, when they came to be made public. The truth 

* The following are the articles of capitulation, as published at the time from 
the duplicate copy retained by Colonel Washington.

is, Colonel Washington had been grossly deceived by the interpreter, 
either through ignorance or design. An officer of his regiment, who 
was present at the reading and signing of the articles, wrote as fol- 
lows on this point five weeks afterwards in a letter to a friend. 

" When Mr. Vanbraam returned Tf ith the French proposals, we 
were obliged to take the sense of them from his mouth; it rained so 
hard, that he could not give us a written translation of them ; we 
could scarcely keep the candle lighted to read them by ; and every 
officer there is ready to declare, that there was no such word as as- 
sassination mentioned. The terms expressed were, the death of 
Jumonville. If it had been mentioned, we would by all means have 
had it altered, as the French, during the course of the interview, 
seemed very condescending, and desirous to bring things to a con- 
clusion ; and, upon our insisting, altered the articles relating to 
stores and ammunition, which they wanted to detain ; and that of 
the cannon, which they agreed to have destroyed, instead of reserved 
for their use. 

" Another article, which appears to our disadvantage, is that 
whereby we oblige ourselves not to attempt an establishment beyond 
the mountains. This was translated to us, not to attempt build- 
ings or improvements on the lands of his Most Christian Majesty. 
This we never intended, as we denied he had any there, and there- 
fore thought it needless to dispute the point. 

" The last article, which relates to the hostages, is quite different 
from the translation of it given to us. It is mentioned for the secu- 
rity of the performance of this treaty, as well as for the return of the 
prisoners. There was never such an intention on our side, or men- 
tion of it made on theirs by our interpreter. Thus by the evil inten- 
tion or negligence of Vanbraam, our conduct is scrutinized by a busy 
world, fond of criticizing the proceedings of others, without con- 
sidering circumstances, or giving just attention to reasons, which 
might be offered to obviate their censures." 

Vanbraam was a Dutchman, and had but an imperfect knowledge 
of either the French or English language. How far his ignorance

The parts here marked in italics were misrepresented by the interpreter, or 
at least the meaning of them was so imperfectly and obscurely expressed by 
him, as to be misunderstood by Colonel Washington and his officers. The 
words, pendant une annee a compter de cejoitr, which occur at the end of the 
sixth article in the copy retained by Colonel Washington, are not found in 
the copy of the articles printed by the French government. 



APPENDIX.] THE GREAT MEADOWS. 461 

should be taken as an apology for his blunders is uncertain. Al- 
though he had approved himself a good officer, yet there were other 
circumstances, which brought his fidelity in question. Governor 
Dinwiddie, in giving an account of this affair to Lord Albemarle, 
says, " In the capitulation they made use of the word assassination, 
but Washington, not knowing French, was deceived by the inter- 
preter, who was a poltroon, and though an officer with us, they say 
he has joined the French." How long Vanbraam was detained as 
a hostage is not known, but he never returned to Virginia, and it was 
the general belief, that he practised an intentional deception in his 
attempts to interpret the articles of capitulation. But whether this 
be true or not, the consequence was unfortunate, as the articles in 
their written form implied an acknowledgment of the charge of assas- 
sinating Jumonville. The French writers, regarding this as an au- 
thentic public document, were confirmed by it in their false impres- 
sions derived from M. de Contrecoeur's letter concerning the fate of 
Jumonville ; and thus a grave historical error, inflicting a deep injus- 
tice on the character of Washington, has been sanctioned by emi- 
nent names, and perpetuated in the belief of the reading portion of 
the French people. 

M. de Villiers, the commander of the French forces, was the 
brother of Jumonville. His account of the march from Fort Du- 
quesne, and the transactions at the Great Meadows, was published 
by the French government, in connexion with what purported to be 
extracts from Colonel Washington's journal taken at Braddock's 
defeat. Many years afterwards, some person sent to Washington a 
translation of these papers, upon which he made a brief comment, 
which it is proper to introduce in this place, after inserting an extract 
from that part of M. de Villiers' narrative, which relates to the affair 
of the Great Meadows. 

" As we had no knowledge of the place," says M. de Villiers, 
"we presented our flank to the fort, when they' began to fire on us 
with their cannon. Almost at the same instant, that I saw the En- 
glish on the right coming towards us, the Indians as well as ourselves 
set up a loud cry, and we advanced upon them ; but they did not 
give us time to fire before they retreated behind an intrenchment ad- 
joining the fort. We then prepared ourselves to invest the fort. It 
was advantageously situated in a meadow, and within musket-shot 
of the wood. We approached as near to them as possible, and not 
uselessly expose his Majesty's subjects. The fire was spirited on 
both sides, and I placed myself in the position where it seemed to me 
most likely a sortie would be attempted. If the expression may be 

MM* 



462 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 



allowed, we almost extinguished the fire of their cannon by our mus- 
ketry. 

" About six o'clock in the evening the fire of the enemy increased 
with renewed vigor, and continued till eight. We returned it 
briskly. We had taken effectual measures to secure our posts, and 
keep the enemy in the fort all night ; and, after having put ourselves 
in the best position possible, w<; called out to the English, that, if 
they desired a parley with us, we would cease firing. They accepted 
the proposal. A captain came out, and I sent M. de Mercier to re- 
ceive him, and went to the Meadow myself, where we told him, that 
not being at war, we were willing to save them from the cruelties 
which they would expose themselves on the part of the savages by an 
obstinate resistance, that we could take from them all the hope of 
escape during the night, that we consented nevertheless to show thei 
favor, as we had come only to avenge the assassination, which the] 
had inflicted upon my brother, in violation of the most sacred laws, 
and to oblige them to depart from the territories of the King. We 
then agreed to accord to them the capitulation, a copy of which is 
hereunto annexed. 

" We considered that nothing could be more advantageous to the 
nation than this capitulation, as it was unnatural in the time of peace 
to make prisoners. We made the English consent to sign, that they 
had assassinated my brother in his camp. We took hostages for the 
French, who were in their power ; we caused them to abandon the 
lands belonging to the King ; we obliged them to leave their cannon, 
which consisted of nine pieces ; we had destroyed all their horses 
and cattle, and made them sign, that the favor we granted them was 
only to prove how much we desired to treat them as friends. That 
very night the articles were signed, and I received in camp the hos- 
tages, whom I had demanded. 

"On the 4th, at the dawn of day, I sent a detachment to take 
possession of the fort. The garrison defiled, and the number of 
their dead and wounded excited my pity, in spite of the resentment, 
which I felt for the manner in which they had taken away the life of 
my brother. 

" The savages, who in every thing had adhered to my wishes, 
claimed the right of plunder, but I prevented them. The English, 
struck with a panic, took to flight, and left their flag and one of their 
colors. I demolished the fort, and M. de Mercier caused the cannon 
to be broken, as also the one granted by the capitulation, the En- 
glish not being able to take it away. I hastened my departure, after 
having burst open the casks of liquor, to prevent the disorders which

would otherwise infallibly have followed. One of my Indians took 
ten Englishmen, whom he brought to me, and whom I sent back by 
another." Memoirs contenant le Precis des Fails, &c. p. 147. 

Such is the statement of M. de Villiers. The incident, mentioned 
at the close, of an Indian taking ten Englishmen, is so ludicrous, 
that it must necessarily cast a shade of doubt over the whole, and 
cause us to suspect the writer's accuracy of facts and soundness of 
judgment, whatever we may think of the fertility of his imagination, 
and his exuberant self-complacency. Washington's remarks on this 
extract were communicated in the following letter to a gentleman, 
who had previously written to him on the subject. 
" SIR, 

" I am really sorry, that I have it not in my power to answer your 
request in a more satisfactory manner. If you had favored me with 
the journal a few days sooner, I would have examined it carefully, 
and endeavoured to point out such errors as might conduce to your 
use, my advantage, and the public satisfaction ; but now it is out of 
my power. 

" I had no time to make any remarks upon that piece, which is 
called my journal. The enclosed are observations on the French 
notes. They are of no use to me separated, nor will they, I believe, 
be of any to you ; yet I send them unconnected and incoherent as 
they were taken, for I have no opportunity to correct them. 

" In regard to the journal, I can only observe in general, that I 
kept no regular one during that expedition ; rough minutes of occur- 
rences I certainly took, and find them as certainly and strangely 
metamorphosed ; some parts left out, which I remember were entered, 
and many things added that never were thought of; the names of 
men and things egregiously miscalled; and the whole of what I saw 
Englished is very incorrect and nonsensical ; yet, I will not pretend 
to say that the little body, who brought it to me, has not made a lite- 
ral translation, and a good one. 

" Short as my time is, I cannot help remarking on Villiers' account 
of the battle of, and transactions at, the Meadows, as it is very extra- 
ordinary, and not less erroneous than inconsistent. He says the 
French received the first fire. It is well known, that we received it 
at six hundred paces' distance. He also says, our fears obliged us to 
retreat in a most disorderly manner after the capitulation. How is 
this consistent with his other account? He acknowledges, that we 
sustained the attack warmly from ten in the morning until dark, 
and that he called first to parley, which strongly indicates that we 
were not totally absorbed in fear. If the gentleman in his account 



464 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

had adhered to the truth, he must have confessed, that we looked 
upon his offer to parley as an artifice to get into and examine our 
trenches, and refused on this account, until they desired an officer 
might be sent to them, and gave their parole for his safe return. He 
might also, if he had been as great a lover of the truth as he was of 
vainglory, have said, that we absolutely refused their first and secon 
proposals, and would consent to capitulate on no other terms th 
such as we obtained. That we were wilfully, or ignorantly, deceived 
by our interpreter in regard to the word assassination, I do aver, and 
will to my dying moment ; so will every officer that was present. 
The interpreter was a Dutchman, little acquainted with the English 
tongue, therefore might not advert to the tone and meaning of the 
word in English ; but, whatever his motives were for so doing, certain 
it is, he called it the death, or the loss, of the Sieur Jumonville. So 
we received and so we understood it, until, to our great surprise and 
mortification, we found it otherwise in a literal translation. 

" That we left our baggage and horses at the Meadows is certain ; 
that there was not even a possibility to bring them away is equally 
certain, as we had every horse belonging to the camp killed or taken 
away during the action ; so that it was impracticable to bring any 
thing off", that our shoulders were not able to bear ; and to wait there 
was impossible, for we had scarce three days' provisions, and were 
seventy miles from a supply ; yet, to say we came off precipitately is 
absolutely false ; notwithstanding they did, contrary to articles, suffer 
their Indians to pillage our baggage, and commit all kinds of irregu- 
larity, we were with them until ten o'clock the next day ; we de- 
stroyed our powder and other stores, nay, even our private baggage, 
to prevent its falling into their hands, as we could not bring it off. 
When we had got about a mile from the place of action, we missed 
two or three of the wounded, and sent a party back to bring them 
up ; this is the party he speaks of. We brought them all safe off, 
and encamped within three miles of the Meadows. These are cir- 
cumstances, I think, that make it evidently clear, that we were not 
very apprehensive of danger. The colors he speaks of as left were 
a large flag of immense size and weight; our regimental colors were 
brought off and are now in my possession. Their gasconades, and 
boasted clemency, must appear in the most ludicrous light to every 
considerate person, who reads Villiers' journal ; such preparations for 
an attack, such vigor and intrepidity as he pretends to have con- 
ducted his march with, such revenge as by his own account ap- 
peared in his attack, considered, it will hardly be thought that com- 
passion was his motive for calling a parley. But to sum up the whole, 




APPENDIX.] THE GREAT MEADOWS. 465 

Mr. Villiers pays himself no great compliment in saying, we were 
struck with a panic when matters were adjusted. We surely could 
not be afraid without cause, and if we had cause after capitulation, 
it was a reflection upon himself. 

" I do not doubt, but your good nature will excuse the badness of 
my paper, and the incoherence of my writing ; think you see me in a 
public house in a crowd, surrounded with noise, and you hit my case. 
You do me particular honor in offering your friendship; I wish I 
may be so happy as always to merit it, and deserve your correspon 
dence, which I should be glad to cultivate." 

In September, somewhat more than two months after the capitula- 
tion, Captain Mackay wrote to Washington from Will's Creek, stat 
ing that he had recently returned from Philadelphia, and adding, 
" I had several disputes about our capitulation, but I satisfied every 
person, that mentioned the subject, as to the articles in question, thaf 
they were owing to a bad interpreter, and contrary to the translation 
made to us when we signed them." 

No more needs be said to show the true light, in which the articles 
of capitulation were understood by Washington and his officers. It 
is not to be inferred, however, that M. de Villiers was knowingly 
guilty of an imposition, in regard to the clause relating to the death 
of his brother. On the contrary, it seems more than probable, that 
he really believed the report of the assassination, for he had received 
no other intelligence, or explanation, than the rumor brought to 
M. de Contrecoeur by the Canadian and the savages. This fact, 
however, does not lessen the injury done to Washington, in seriously 
using the articles of capitulation as a historical document to sanction 
a charge, equally untrue in all its essential particulars, and unjust in 
its application. 

When the Virginia House of Burgesses met in August, they reques- 
ted the Governor to lay before them a copy of the capitulation, and, up- 
on a due consideration of the subject, passed a vote of thanks to Colo- 
nel Washington and his officers " for their bravery and gallant defence 
of their country." The names of all the officers were enumerated, 
except those of the major of the regiment, and of Captain Vanbraam, 
the former of whom was charged with cowardice, and the latter of 
having acted a treacherous part in his interpretation of the articles. 
The Burgesses, also, in an address to the Governor, expressed their 
approbation of the instructions he had given to the officers and forces 
sent on the Ohio expedition. In short, all the proceedings of the 
campaign were not only approved, but applauded, by the representa- 
tives of the people, and by the public generally. A pistole was

granted to each of the soldiers, who had been in the engagement. 
To the vote of thanks Washington replied as follows. 

TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 

" Williamsburg, 23 October, 1754. 
" SIR, 

"Nothing could give me, and the officers under my command, 
greater satisfaction, than to receive the thanks of the House of Bur- 
gesses, in so particular and public a manner, for our behaviour in the 
late unsuccessful engagement with the French ; and we unanimously 
hope, that our future proceedings in the service of our country will 
entitle us to a continuance of your approbation. I assure you, Sir, I 
shall always look upon it as my indispensable duty to endeavour to 
deserve it. 

" I was desired by the officers of the Virginia regiment to make 
their suitable acknowledgments for the honor they have received in 
your thanks; I therefore hope the enclosed will be agreeable, and 
answer their, and the intended purpose of, Sir, your most obedient 
humble servant, 

" GEORGE WASHINGTON." 

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE SPEAKER, AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE 
HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 

" We, the officers of the Virginia regiment, are highly sensible of 
the particular mark of distinction, with which you have honored us, 
in returning your thanks for our behaviour in the late action, and 
cannot help testifying our grateful acknowledgments for your high 
sense of what we shall always esteem a duty to ouj country and the 
best of kings. 

" Favored with your regard, we shall zealously endeavour to de- 
serve your applause, and by our future actions strive to convince the 
worshipful House of Burgesses, how much we esteem their approba- 
tion, and, as it ought to be, regard it as the voice of our country. 
" Signed for the whole corps, 

" GEORGE WASHINGTON." 

The exact number of men engaged in the action of the Great 
Meadows cannot be ascertained. The Virginia regiment consisted 
of three hundred and five, including officers, of whom twelve were 
killed and forty-three wounded. These numbers are stated in a re- 
turn made out by Colonel Washington himself. Captain Mackay's 




APPENDIX.] THE GREAT MEADOWS. 467 

Independent Company was supposed to contain about one hundred, 
but the number of killed and wounded is not known. The two In- 
dependent Companies from New York, which arrived at Alexandria, 
never joined the Virginia regiment, although former writers, in de- 
scribing this event, have said they were present. The amount of the 
French force is also uncertain. It was believed by Colonel Wash- 
ington, from such information as he could get, to consist of nine hun- 
dred men. M. de Villiers says, that he left Fort Duquesne with five 
hundred Frenchmen and eleven Indians. The number of French is 
perhaps correct, but the Indians were much more numerous, when 
they arrived at the scene of action ; and there is good reason for be- 
lieving, that the French and Indians together made a body of at least 
nine hundred. 

It was a subject of mortification to Colonel Washington, that Gov- 
ernor Dinwiddie refused to ratify the capitulation, in regard to the 
French prisoners. The Governor thus explained his conduct in a 
letter to the Board of Trade. " The French, after the capitulation 
entered into with Colonel Washington, took eight of our people, and 
exposed them to sale, and, missing thereof, sent them prisoners to 
Canada. On hearing of this, I detained the seventeen prisoners, the 
officer, and two cadets, as I am of opinion, after they were in my 
custody, Washington could not engage for their being returned. I 
have ordered a flag of truce to be sent to the French, offering the re- 
turn of their officer and the two cadets for the two hostages they have 
of ours." This course of proceeding was not suitable to the princi- 
ples of honor and sense of equity entertained by Colonel Washington, 
but he had no further control of the affair. 

The hostages were not returned, \ as requested by the Governor's 
flag of truce, and the French prisoners were detained in Virginia, 
and supported and clothed at the public charge, having a weekly al- 
lowance for that purpose. The private men were kept in confine- 
ment, but Drouillon and the two cadets were allowed to go at large, 
first in Williamsburg, then at Winchester, and last at Alexandria, 
where they resided when General Braddock arrived. It was then 
deemed improper for them to go at large, observing the motions of 
the General's army, and the Governor applied to Commodore Keppel 
to take them on board his ships ; but he declined, on the ground that 
he had no instructions about prisoners. By the advice of General 
Braddock, the privates were put on board the transports, and sent to 
England. M. Drouillon and the cadets went passengers in another 
ship at the charge of the colony. La Force, having been only a vol- 
unteer in the skirmish, and not in a military capacity, and having

previously committed acts of depredation on the frontiers, was kept 
in prison at Williamsburg. Being a person of ready resources, and 
an enterprising spirit, he broke from prison and made his way seve- 
ral miles into the country, when his foreign accent betrayed him, 
and he was taken up, and remanded to close confinement. 

Vanbraam and Stobo were conveyed to Quebec, and retained 
there as prisoners, till they were sent to England by the Governor of 
Canada.

BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT. 

The defeat of General Braddock, on the banks of the Mononga- 
hela, is one of the most remarkable events in American history. 
Great preparations had been made for the expedition under that ex- 
perienced officer, and there was the most sanguine anticipation, both 
in England and America, of its entire success. Such was the confi- 
dence in the prowess of Braddock's army, according to Dr. Franklin, 
that, while he was on his march to Fort Duquesne, a subscription 
paper was handed about in Philadelphia to raise money to celebrate 
his victory by bonfires and illuminations, as soon as the intelligence 
should arrive. When, therefore, the news of his total defeat and 
overthrow went abroad, the effect produced on the public mind was 
like the shock of an earthquake, unexpected and astounding. Of 
the possibility of such an issue no one had dreamed, and the expres- 
sions of surprise, as well as of disappointment, were loud and univer- 
sal. The consequences were alarming to the middle colonies, as 
their frontiers were left exposed to the ravages of the French and 
Indians, in which situation they continued till Fort Duquesne was 
taken by General Forbes, more than three years afterwards. 

General Braddock landed in Virginia on the 20th of February, 
1755, with two regiments of the British army from Ireland, the forty- 
fourth and forty-eighth, each consisting of five hundred men, one of 
them commanded by Sir Peter Halket, and the other by Colonel 
Dunbar. To these was joined a suitable train of artillery, with mili- 
tary supplies and provisions. The General's first head-quarters were 
at Alexandria, and the troops were stationed in that place and its vi- 
cinity, till they marched for Will's Creek, where they arrived about 



APPENDIX.] BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT. 469 

the middle of May. It took four weeks to effect that march. In let- 
ters written at Will's Creek, General Braddock, with much severity 
of censure, complained of the lukewarmness of the colonial govern- 
ments and tardiness of the people in facilitating his enterprise, the 
dishonesty of agents, and the faithlessness of contractors. The 
forces, which he brought together at Will's Creek, however, amounted 
to somewhat more than two thousand effective men, of whom about 
one thousand belonged to the royal regiments, and the remainder 
were furnished by the colonies. In this number were embraced the 
fragments of two Independent Companies from New York, one of 
which was commanded by Captain Gates, afterwards a major-general 
in the Revolutionary war. Thirty sailors had also been granted for 
the expedition by Admiral Keppel, who commanded the squadron, 
that brought over the two regiments. 

At this post the army was detained three weeks, nor could it then 
have moved, had it not been for the energetic personal services of 
Franklin, among the Pennsylvania farmers, in procuring horses and 
wagons to transport the artillery, provisions, and baggage. The de- 
tails of the march are well described in Colonel Washington's letters. 
The army was separated into two divisions. The advanced division, 
under General Braddock, consisted of twelve hundred men besides 
officers. The other, under Colonel Dunbar, was left in the rear to 
proceed by slower marches. On the 8th of July the General arrived 
with his division, all in excellent health and spirits, at the junction of 
the Youghiogany and Monongahela Rivers. At this place Colonel 
Washington joined the advanced division, being but partially recov- 
ered from a severe attack of fever, which had been the cause of his 
remaining behind. The officers and soldiers were now in the high- 
est spirits, and firm in the conviction, that they should within a few 
hours victoriously enter the walls of Fort Duquesne. 

The steep and rugged grounds, on the north side of the Mononga- 
hela, prevented the army from marching in that direction, and it was 
necessary in approaching the fort, now about fifteen miles distant, to 
ford the river twice, and march a part of the way on the south side. 
Early on the morning of the 9th all things were in readiness, and the 
whole train passed through the river a little below the mouth of the 
Youghiogany, and proceeded in perfect order along the southern 
margin of the Monongahela. Washington was often heard to say 
during his lifetime, that the most beautiful spectacle he had ever 
beheld was the display of the British troops on this eventful morning. 
Every man was neatly dressed in full uniform, the soldiers were ar- 
ranged in columns and marched in exact order, the sun gleamed

470 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

from their burnished arms, the river flowed tranquilly on their right, 
and the deep forest overshadowed them with solemn grandeur on 
their left. Officers and men were equally inspirited with cheering 
hopes and confident anticipations. 

In this manner they marched forward till about noon, when thei 
arrived at the second crossing-place, ten miles from Fort Duquesm 
They halted but a little time, and then began to ford the river and r< 
gain its northern bank. As soon as they had crossed, they cam; 
upon a level plain, elevated but a few feet above the surface of tU 
river, and extending northward nearly half a mile from its margin. 
Then commenced a gradual ascent at an angle of about three d( 
grees, which terminated in hills of a considerable height at no great 
distance beyond. The road from the fording-place to Fort Duquesne 
led across the plain and up this ascent, and thence proceeded through 
an uneven country, at that time covered with wood. 

By the order of march, a body of three hundred men, under Colo- 
nel Gage, made the advanced party, which was immediately followed 
by another of two hundred. Next came the General with the col- 
umns of artillery, the main body of the army, and the baggage. At 
one o'clock the whole had crossed the river, and almost at this mo- 
ment a sharp firing was heard upon the advanced parties, who were 
now ascending the hill, and had got forward about a hundred yards 
from the termination of the plain. A heavy discharge of musketry was 
poured in upon their front, which was the first intelligence they had 
of the proximity of an enemy, and this was suddenly followed by an- 
other on their right flank. They were filled with the greater con- 
sternation, as no enemy was in sight, and the firing seemed to pro- 
ceed from an invisible foe. They fired in their turn, however, but 
quite at random and obviously without effect, as the enemy kept up a 
discharge in quick and continued succession. 

The General advanced speedily to the relief of these detachments ; 
but before he could reach the spot, which they occupied, they gave 
way and fell back upon the artillery and the other columns of the 
army, causing extreme confusion, and striking the whole mass with 
such a panic, that no order could afterwards be restored. The Gen- 
eral and the officers behaved with the utmost courage, and used 
every effort to rally the men, and bring them to order, but all in vain. 
In this state they continued nearly three hours, huddling together in 
confused bodies, firing irregularly, shooting down their own officers 
and men, and doing no perceptible harm to the enemy. The Vir- 
ginia provincials were the only troops, who seemed to retain their 
senses, and they behaved with a bravery and resolution worthy of a 



APPENDIX.] BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT. 471 

better fate. They adopted the Indian mode, and fought each man 
for himself behind a tree. This was prohibited by the General, who 
endeavoured to form his men into platoons and columns, as if they 
had been manoeuvring on the plains of Flanders. Meantime the 
French and Indians, concealed in the ravines and behind trees, kept 
up a deadly and unceasing discharge of musketry, singling out their 
objects, taking deliberate aim, and producing a carnage almost unpar- 
alleled in the annals of modern warfare. More than half of the 
whole army, which had crossed the river in so r proud an array only 
three hours before, were killed or wounded, the General himself had 
received a mortal wound, and many of his best officers had fallen by 
his side. 

In describing the action a few days afterwards, Colonel Orme 
wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania ; " The men were so 
extremely deaf to the exhortation of the General and the officers, that 
they fired away in the most irregular manner all their ammunition, 
and then ran off, leaving to the enemy the artillery, ammunition, pro- 
vision, and baggage ; nor could they be persuaded to stop till they got 
as far as Gist's plantation, nor there only in part, many of them pro- 
ceeding as far as Colonel Dunbar's party, who lay six miles on this 
side. The officers were absolutely sacrificed by their good behav- 
iour, advancing sometimes in bodies, sometimes separately, hoping 
by such example to engage the soldiers to follow them, but to no pur- 
pose. The General had five horses shot under him, and at last 
received a wound through his right arm into his lungs, of which he 
died the 13th instant. Secretary Shirley was shot through the 
head ; Captain Morris, wounded. Colonel Washington had two 
horses shot under him, and his clothes shot through in several places, 
behaving the whole time with the greatest courage and resolution. 
Sir Peter Halket was killed upon the spot. Colonel Burton and Sir 
John St. Clair were wounded." In addition to these, the other field- 
officers wounded were Lieutenant-Colonel Gage (afterwards so well 
known as the commander of the British forces in Boston, at the 
beginning of the Revolution), Colonel Orme, Major Sparks, and 
Brigade-Major Halket. Ten captains were- killed, and five wound- 
ed ; fifteen lieutenants killed, and twenty-two wounded ; the whole 
number of officers in the engagement was eighty-six, of whom twenty- 
six were killed, and thirty-seven wounded. The killed and wounded 
of the privates amounted to seven hundred and fourteen. Of these 
at least one half were supposed to be killed. Their bodies, left on the 
field of action, were stripped and scalped by the Indians. All the 
artillery, ammunition, provisions, and baggage, every thing in the train

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX 



of the army, fell into the enemy's hands, and were given up to be 
pillaged by the savages. General Braddock's papers were also taken, 
among which were his instructions and correspondence with the 
ministry after his arrival in Virginia. The same fate befell the papers 
of Colonel Washington, including a private journal and his official 
correspondence during his campaign of the preceding year. 

No circumstantial account of this affair has ever been published 
by the French, nor has it hitherto been known from any authentic 
source what numbers were engaged on their side. Washington 
conjectured, as stated in his letters, that there were no more th 
three hundred, and Dr. Franklin, in his account of the battle 
considers them at most as not exceeding four hundred. The trut 
is, there was no accurate information on the subject, and write 
have been obliged to rely on conjecture. 

In the archives of the War Department, at Paris, I found thre 
separate narratives of this event written at the time, all brief and 
imperfect, but one of them apparently drawn up by a person on the 
spot. From these I have collected the following particulars. 

M. de Contrecoeur, the commandant of Fort Duquesne, received 
early intelligence of the arrival of General Braddock and the British 
regiments in Virginia. After his remove from Will's Creek, French 
and Indian scouts were constantly abroad, who watched his motions, 
reported the progress of his march, and the route he was pursuing. 
His army was represented to consist of three thousand men. M. de 
Contreco3ur was hesitating what measures to take, believing his small 
force wholly inadequate to encounter so formidable an army, when 
M. de Beaujeu, a captain in the French service, proposed to head 
a detachment of French and Indians, and meet the enemy in their 
march. The consent of the Indians was first to be obtained. A 
large body of them was then encamped in the vicinity of the Fort, 
and M. de Beaujeu opened to them his plan, and requested their aid. 
This they at first declined, giving as a reason the superior force of 
the enemy, and the impossibility of success. But at the pressing 
solicitation of M. de Beaujeu, they agreed to hold a council on the 
subject, and to talk with him again the next morning. They still 
adhered to their first decision, and when M. de Beaujeu went out 
among them to inquire the result of their deliberation, they told 
him a second time that they could not go. This was a severe dis- 
appointment to M. de Beaujeu, who had set his heart upon the 
enterprise, and was resolved to prosecute it. Being a man of great 
good nature, affability, and ardor, and much beloved by the savages, 
he said to them ; "I am determined to go out and meet the ene-

BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT. 



473 



my. What ! will you suffer your Father to go out alone ? I am 
sure we shall conquer." With this spirited harangue, delivered in a 
manner that pleased the Indians, and won upon their confidence, he 
subdued their unwillingness, and they agreed to accompany him. 

It was now the 7th of July, and news came that the English 
were within six leagues of the Fort. This day and the next were 
spent in making preparations, and reconnoitring the ground for 
attack. Two other captains, Dumas and Liguery were joined with 
M. de Beaujeu, and also four lieutenants, six ensigns, and two cadets. 
On the morning of the 9th they were all in readiness, and began 
their march at an early hour. It seems to have been their first inten- 
tion to make a stand at the ford, and annoy the English while 
crossing the river, and then retreat to the ambuscade on the side of 
the hill where the contest actually commenced. The trees on the 
bank of the river afforded a good opportunity to effect this manoeuvre, 
in the Indian mode of warfare, since the artillery could be of little 
avail against an enemy, where every man was protected by a tree, 
and at the same time the English would be exposed to a point-blank 
musket-shot in fording the river. As it happened, however, M. de 
Beaujeu and his party did not arrive in time to execute this part of 
the plan. 

The English were preparing to cross the river, when the French 
and Indians reached the defiles on the rising ground, where they 
posted themselves, and waited till Braddock's advanced columns 
came up. This was a signal for the attack, which was made at first 
in front, and repelled by so heavy a discharge from the British, that 
the Indians believed it proceeded from artillery, and showed symp- 
toms of wavering and retreat. At this moment M. de Beaujeu was 
killed, and the command devolving on M. Dumas, he showed great 
presence of mind in rallying the Indians, and ordered his officers to 
lead them to the wings and attack the enemy in flank, while he with 
the French troops would maintain the position in front. This order 
was promptly obeyed, and the attack became general. The action was 
warm and severely contested for a short time ; but the English fought 
in the European method, firing at random, which had little effect in 
the woods, while the Indians fired from concealed places, took aim, 
and almost every shot brought down a man. The English columns 
soon got into confusion ; the yell of the savages, with which the woods 
resounded, struck terror into the hearts of the soldiers, till at length 
they took to flight, and resisted all the endeavours of their officers to 
restore any degree of order in their escape. The rout was complete, 
and the field of battle was left covered with the dead and wounded, 



VOL. II.

474 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

and all the artillery, ammunition, provisions, and baggage of the En- 
glish army. The Indians gave themselves up to pillage, which pre- 
vented them from pursuing the English in their flight. 

Such is the substance of the accounts written at the time by the 
French officers, and sent home to their government. In regard to 
the numbers engaged, there are some slight variations in the three 
statements. The largest number reported is two hundred and fifty 
French and Canadians, and six hundred and forty-one Indians ; and 
the smallest, two hundred and thirty-three French and Canadians, 
and six hundred Indians. If we take a medium, it will make the 
whole number led out by M. de Beaujeu at least eight hundred and 
fifty. In an imperfect return, three officers were stated to be killed, 
and four wounded ; about thirty soldiers and Indians killed, and as 
many wounded. 

When these facts are taken into view, the result of the action will 
appear much less wonderful, than has generally been supposed. And 
this wonder will be still diminished, when another circumstance is 
recurred to, worthy of particular consideration, and that is, the shape 
of the ground on which the battle was fought. This part of the de- 
scription, so essential to the understanding of military operations, and 
above all in the present instance, has never been touched upon, it is 
believed, by any writer. We have seen that Brad dock's advanced 
columns, after crossing the valley extending for nearly half a mile 
from the margin of the river, began to move up a hill, so uniform in 
its ascent, that it was little else than an inclined plane of a somewhat 
crowning form. Down this inclined surface extended two ravines, 
beginning near together, at about one hundred and fifty yards 
from the bottom of the hill, and proceeding in different directions till 
they terminated in the valley below. In these ravines the French 
and Indians were concealed and protected. At this day they are 
from eight to ten feet deep, and sufficient in extent to contain at least 
a thousand men. At the time of the battle, the ground was covered 
with trees and long grass, so that the ravines were entirely hidden 
from view, till they were approached within a few feet. Indeed, at 
the present day, although the place is cleared from trees, and con- 
verted into pasture, they are perceptible only at a very short distance. 
By this knowledge of the local peculiarities of the battle-ground, the 
mystery, that the British conceived themselves to be contending with 
an invisible foe, is solved. Such was literally the fact. They were 
so paraded between the ravines, that their whole front and right flank 
were exposed to the incessant fire of the enemy, who discharged their 
muskets over the edge of the ravines, concealed during that operation 




APPENDIX.] BRADDOCK'S DEFEAT. 475 

by the grass and bushes, and protected by an invincible barrier below 
the surface of the earth. William uutler, a veteran soldier still living 
(1832), who was in this action, and afterwards at the Plains of Abra- 
ham, said to me, " We could only tell where the enemy were by the 
smoke of their muskets." A few scattering Indians were behind 
trees, and some were killed in venturing out to take scalps, but much 
the larger portion fought wholly in the ravines. 

It is not probable, that either General Braddock or any one of his 
officers suspected the actual situation of th'e enemy, during the whole 
bloody contest. It was a fault in the General, for which no apology 
can be offered, that he did not keep scouts and guards in advance 
and on the wings of his army, who would have made all proper dis- 
coveries before the whole had been brought into a snare. This ne- 
glect was the primary cause of his defeat, which might have been 
avoided. Had he charged with the bayonet, the ravines would have 
been cleared instantly ; or had he brought his artillery to the points 
where the ravines terminated in the valley, and scoured them with 
grape-shot, the same consequence would have followed. But the 
total insubordination of his troops would have prevented both these 
movements, even if he had become acquainted with the ground in the 
early part of the action. The disasters of this day, and the fate of 
the commander, brave and resolute as he undoubtedly was, are to be 
ascribed to his contempt of Indian warfare, his overweening confi- 
dence in the prowess of veteran troops, his obstinate self-complacency, 
his disregard of prudent counsel, and his negligence in leaving his 
army exposed to a surprise on their march. He freely consulted 
Colonel Washington, whose experience and judgment, notwithstand- 
ing his youth, claimed the highest respect for his opinions ; but the 
General gave little heed to his advice. While on his march, George 
Croghan, the Indian interpreter, joined him with one hundred friendly 
Indians, who offered their services. These were accepted in so cold 
a manner, and the Indians themselves treated with so much neglect, 
that they deserted him one after another. Washington pressed upon 
him the importance of these men, and the necessity of conciliating and 
retaining them, but without effect. 

A report has long been current in Pennsylvania, that Braddock 
was shot by one of his own men, founded on the declaration of a 
provincial soldier, who was in the action. There is another tradi- 
tion, also, worthy of notice, which rests on the authority of Dr. Craik, 
the intimate friend of Washington from his boyhood to his death, and 
who was with him at the battle of the Monongahela. Fifteen years 
after that event, they travelled together on an expedition to the wes- 



476 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



tern country, with a party of woodsmen, for the purpose of exploring 
wild lands. While near the junction of the Great Kenhawa and 
Ohio Rivers, a company of Indians came to them with an interpreter, 
at the head of whom was an aged and venerable chief. This per- 
sonage made known to them by the interpreter, that, hearing Colonel 
Washington was in that region, he had come a long way to visit him, 
adding that during the battle of the Monongahela, he had singled 
him out as a conspicuous object, fired his rifle at him many times, 
and directed his young warriors to do the same, but to his utter as- 
tonishment none of their balls took effect. He was then persuaded, 
that the youthful hero was under the special guardianship of the 
Great Spirit, and ceased to fire at him any longer. He was now 
come to pay homage to the man, who was the particular favorite of 
Heaven, and who could never die in battle. Mr. Custis, of Arling- 
ton, to whom these incidents were related by Dr. Craik, has drama- 
tized them in a piece called The Indian Prophecy. 

When the battle was over, and the remnant of Braddock's army 
had gained, in their flight, the opposite bank of the river, Colonel 
Washington was despatched by the General to meet Colonel Dunbar 
and order forward wagons for the wounded with all possible speed. 
But it was not till the llth, after they had reached Gist's planta- 
tion with great difficulty and much suffering from hunger, that any 
arrived. The General was at first brought off in a tumbril ; he was 
next put on horseback, but, being unable to ride, was obliged to be 
carried by the soldiers. They all reached Dunbar's camp, to which 
the panic had already extended, and a day was passed there in the 
greatest confusion. The artillery was destroyed, and the public stores 
and heavy baggage were burnt, by whose order was never known. 
They moved forward on the 13th, and that night General Braddock 
died, and was buried in the road, for the purpose of concealing his 
body from the Indians. The spot is still pointed out, within a few yards 
of the present National Road, and about a mile west of the site of Fort 
Necessity at the Great Meadows. Captain Stewart, of the Virginia 
forces, had taken particular charge of him from the time he was 
wounded till his death. On the 17th the sick and wounded arrived at 
Fort Cumberland, and were soon after joined by Colonel Dunbar with 
the remaining fragments of the army. The French sent out a party 
as far as Dunbar's camp, and destroyed every thing that was left. 
Colonel Washington, being in very feeble health, proceeded in a few 
days to Mount Vernon.

ADDRESS OF THE OFFICERS TO COLONEL WASHINGTON, ON 
HIS RESIGNING THE COMMAND OF THE VIRGINIA FORCES 

Dated at Fort Loudoun, 31 December, 1758. 
SIR, 

We, your most obedient and affectionate officers, beg leave to ex- 
press our great concern, at the disagreeable news we have received 
of your determination to resign the command of that corps, in which 
we have under you long served. 

The happiness we have enjoyed, and the honor we have acquired 
together, with the mutual regard that has always subsisted between 
you and your officers, have implanted so sensible an affection in the 
minds of us all, that we cannot be silent on this critical occasion. 

In our earliest infancy you took us under your tuition, trained us 
up in the practice of that discipline, which alone can constitute good 
troops, from the punctual observance of which you never suffered the 
least deviation. 

Your steady adherence to impartial justice, your quick discern- 
ment, and invariable regard to merit, wisely intended to inculcate 
those genuine sentiments of true honor and passion for glory, from 
which the greatest military achievements have been derived, first 
heightened our natural emulation and our desire to excel. How 
much we improved by those regulations and your own example, with 
what alacrity we have hitherto discharged our duty, with what cheer- 
fulness we have encountered the severest toils, especially while under 
your particular directions, we submit to yourself, and flatter our- 
selves that we have in a great measure answered your expectations. 

Judge, then, how sensibly we must be affected with the loss of 
such an excellent commander, such a sincere friend, and so affa- 
ble a companion. How rare is it to find these amiable qualities 
blended together in one man ! How great the loss of such a man ! 
Adieu to that superiority, which the enemy have granted us over 
other troops, and which even the regulars and provincials have done 
us the honor publicly to acknowledge ! Adieu to that strict discipline 
and order, which you have always maintained ! Adieu to that happy 
union and harmony, which have been our principal cement ! 

It gives us additional sorrow, when we reflect, to find our unhappy 
country will receive a loss no less irreparable than our own. Where 
will it meet a man so experienced in military affairs, one so renowned 
for patriotism, conduct, and courage ? Who has so great a knowledge

of the enemy we have to deal with ? Who so well acquainted with 
their situation and strength? Who so much respected by the sol- 
diery ? Who, in short, so able to support the military character of 
Virginia? 

Your approved love to your King and country, and your uncom- 
mon perseverance in promoting the honor and true interest of the 
service, convince us that the most cogent reasons only could induce 
you to quit it ; yet we, with the greatest deference, presume to en- 
treat you to suspend those thoughts for another year, and to lead us 
on to assist in the glorious work of extirpating our enemies, towards 
which so considerable advances have been already made. In you 
we place the most implicit confidence. Your presence only will 
cause a steady firmness and vigor to actuate every breast, despis- 
ing the greatest dangers, and thinking light of toils and hardships, 
while led on by the man we know and love. 

But if we must be so unhappy as to part, if the exigencies of your 
affairs force you to abandon us, we beg it as our last request, that you 
will recommend some person most capable to command, whose mili- 
tary knowledge, whose honor, whose conduct, and whose disinter- 
ested principles, we may depend on. 

Frankness, sincerity, and a certain openness of soul, are the true 
characteristics of an officer, and we flatter ourselves that you do not 
think us capable of saying any thing contrary to the purest dictates 
of our minds. Fully persuaded of this, we beg leave to assure you, 
that, as you have hitherto been the actuating soul of our whole corps, 
we shall at all times pay the most invariable regard to your will and 
pleasure, and will always be happy to demonstrate by our actions 
with how much respect and esteem we are, &c.

THE OHIO COMPANY. 

As the Ohio Company is often mentioned in this volume, and as 
two of Washington's brothers were much concerned in it, a brief 

o * 

sketch of its history may not be unsuitable in this place. 

In the year 1748, Thomas Lee, one of his Majesty's Council in 
Virginia, formed the design of effecting settlements on the wild lands 
west of the Allegany mountains, through the agency of an associa-

tion of gentlemen. Before this date there were no English resi- 
dents in those regions. A few traders wandered from tribe to tribe, 
and dwelt among the Indians, but they neither cultivated nor occu- 
pied the lands. 

With the view of carrying his plan into operation, Mr. Lee asso- 
ciated himself with twelve other persons in Virginia and Maryland, 
and with Mr. Hanbury, a merchant in London, who formed what 
they called " The Ohio Company" Lawrence Washington, and his 
brother Augustine Washington, were among the first, who engaged 
in this scheme. A petition was presented to the King in behalf of 
the Company, which was approved, and five hundred thousand acres 
of land were granted almost in the terms requested by the Company. 

The object of the Company was to settle the lands, and to carry on 
the Indian trade upon a large scale. Hitherto the trade with the 
western Indians had been mostly in the hands of the Pennsylvanians, 
The Company conceived, that they might derive an important advan- 
tage over their competitors in this trade, from the water communica- 
tion of the Potomac and the eastern branches of the Ohio, whose 
head waters approximated each other. The lands were to be chiefly 
taken on the south side of the Ohio, between the Monongahela and 
Kenhawa Rivers, and west of the Alleganies. The privilege was 
reserved, however, by the Company, of embracing a portion of the 
lands on the north side of the river, if it should be deemed expedient. 
Two hundred thousand acres were to be selected immediately, and 
to be held for ten years free from quitrent or any tax to the King, 
on condition that the Company should at their own expense seat one 
hundred families on the lands within seven years, and build a fort, 
and maintain g garrison sufficient to protect the settlement. 

The first steps taken by the Company were to order Mr. Hanbury, 
their agent in London, to send over for their use two cargoes of 
goods suited to the Indian trade, amounting in the whole to four 
thousand pounds sterling, one cargo to arrive in November, 1749, 
the other in March following. They resolved, also, that such roads 
should be made and houses built, as would facilitate the communica- 
tion from the head of navigation on the Potomac River across the 
mountains to some point on the Monongahela. And as no attempt 
at establishing settlements could safely be made without some pre- 
vious arrangements with the Indians, the Company petitioned the 
government of Virginia to invite them to a treaty. As a preliminary 
to other proceedings, the Company also sent out Mr. Christopher Gist 
with instructions to explore the country, examine the quality of the 
lands, keep a journal of his adventures, draw as accurate a plan of 



480 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

the country as his observations would permit, and report the same to 
the board. On his first tour he was absent nearly seven months, 
penetrated the country for several hundred miles north of the Ohio, 
visited the Twigtwee Indians, and proceeded as far south as the falls 
of that river. In November following (1751), he passed down th 
south side of the river, as far as the Great Kenhawa, and spent th 
winter in exploring the lands on that route. Meantime the Indian 
had 'failed to assemble at Logstown, where they had been invited b 
the Governor of Virginia to hold a treaty. It was natural that th 
traders, who had already got possession of the ground, should e 
deavour to bias the Indians, and throw obstacles in the way of an 
interference from another quarter. The French were likewise ta 
pering with them, and from political motives were using means 
withdraw them from every kind of alliance or intimacy with the E 
glish. The Company found, that it would be in vain to expect muc 
progress in their designs, till measures had been adopted for winning 
over the Indians ; and accordingly the proposed treaty of Logstown 
took place the next year, when Mr. Gist attended as an agent from 
the Company, and the Indians agreed not to molest any settlements, 
that might be made on the south-east side of the Ohio. This treaty 
was concluded June 13th, 1752. Colonel Fry, and two other com- 
missioners, were present on the part of Virginia. 

It is remarkable, that, in the debates attending the negotiation of 
this treaty, the Indians took care to disclaim a recognition of the En- 
glish title to any of these lands. In a speech to the Commissioners, 
one of the old chiefs said, " You acquainted us yesterday with the 
King's right to all the lands in Virginia, as far as it is settled, and 
oack from thence to the sun-setting, whenever he shall think fit to 
extend his settlements. You produced also a copy of Tiis deed from 
the Onondaga Council, at the Treaty of Lancaster [1744], and de- 
sired, that your brethren of the Ohio might likewise confirm the 
deed. We are well acquainted, that our Chief Council at the Treaty 
of Lancaster confirmed a deed to you for a quantity of land in Vir- 
ginia, which you have a right to ; but we never understood, before 
you told us yesterday, that the lands then sold were to extend farther 
to the sun-setting, than the hill on the other side of the Allegany 
Hill, so that we can give you no farther answer." MS. Journal of 
the Commissioners. Hence it appears, that the Indians west of the 
Ohio, who inhabited the lands, had never consented to any treaty 
ceding them to the English, nor understood that this cession extended 
beyond the Allegany Mountains. 

When the Company was first instituted, Mr. Lee, its projector, 





APPENDIX.] THE OHIO COMPANY. 481 

was its principal organ, and most efficient member. He died soon 
afterwards, and then the chief management fell on Lawrence Wash- 
ington, who had engaged in the enterprise with an enthusiasm and 
energy peculiar to his character. His agency was short, however, as 
his rapidly declining health soon terminated in his death. Several 
of the Company's shares changed hands. Governor Dinwiddie and 
George Mason became proprietors. There were originally but twenty 
shares, and the Company never consisted of more than that number 
of members. 

Mr. Lawrence Washington had a project for inducing German set- 
tlers to take up the la'nds. He wrote to Mr. Hanbury as follows. 

" Whilst the unhappy state of my health called me back to our 
Springs [at Bath in Virginia], I conversed with all the Pennsylvanian 
Dutch, whom I met either there or elsewhere, and much recom- 
mended their settling on the Ohio. The chief reason against it was 
the paying of an English clergyman, when few understood, and none 
made use of him. It has been my opinion, and I hope ever will be, that 
restraints on conscience are cruel, in regard to those on whom they 
are imposed, and injurious to the country imposing them. England, 
Holland, and Prussia I may quote as examples, and much more Penn- 
sylvania, which has flourished under that delightful liberty, so as to 
become the admiration of every man, who considers the short time it 
has been settled. As the Ministry have thus far shown the true spirit 
of patriotism, by encouraging the extending of our dominions in Am- 
erica, I doubt not by an application they would still go farther, and 
complete what they have begun, by procuring some kind of charter 
to prevent the residents on the Ohio and its branches from being 
subject to parish taxes. They all assured me, that they might have 
from Germany any number of settlers, could they but obtain their fa- 
vorite exemption. I have promised to endeavour for it, and now do 
my utmost by this letter. I am well assured we shall never obtain it 
by a law here. This colony was greatly settled in the latter part of 
Charles the First's time, and during the usurpation, by the zealous 
churchmen ; and that spirit, which was then brought in, has ever 
since continued, so that except a few Quakers we have no dissenters. 
But what has been the consequence 1 We have increased by slow 
degrees, except negroes and convicts, whilst our neighbouring colo- 
nies, whose natural advantages are greatly inferior to ours, have be- 
come populous." 

A proposition was made by several Germans in Pennsylvania, that, 
if they could have the above exemption, they would take fifty thou- 
sand acres of the Company's land, and settle it with two hundred

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



families. Mr. Washington wrote likewise on the subject to Governor 
Dinwiddie, then in England, who replied ; " It gave me pleasure, 
that the Dutch wanted fifty thousand acres of the land granted to the 
Ohio Company, and I observe what you write about their own clergy- 
man, and your endeavour to have them freed from paying the Church 
of England. I fear this will be a difficult task to get over ; and at 
present the Parliament is so busy with public affairs, and the Minis- 
try in course engaged, that we must wait some time before we can 
reply ; but be assured of my utmost endeavours therein." No proof 
exists, that any other steps were taken in the affair. 

Soon after the treaty at Logstown, Mr. Gist was appointed th 
Company's surveyor, and instructed to lay off a town and fort a 
Shurtees Creek, a little below the present site of Pittsburg, and o 
the east side of the Ohio. The Company assessed on themselves fou 
hundred pounds towards constructing the fort. In the mean time 
Mr. Gist had fixed his residence on the other side of the Alleganies, 
in the valley of the Monongahela, and induced eleven families to set- 
tle around him on lands, which it was presumed would be within the 
Company's grant. The goods had come over from England, but had 
never been taken farther into the interior, than Will's Creek, where 
they were sold to traders and Indians, who received them at that 
post. Some progress had been made in constructing a road to the 
Monongahela, but the temper of the Indians was such, as to discour- 
age an attempt to send the goods at the Company's risk to a more re- 
mote point. 

Things were in this state, when the troubles on the frontiers broke 
out between the French and English, involving on one side or the 
other the various Indian tribes. All further operations were sus- 
pended till towards the close of the war, when hostilities had nearly 
ceased on the Virginia frontier from the capture of Fort Duquesne, 
and the weakened efforts of the French. In 1760 a state of the Com- 
pany's case was drawn up by Mr. John Mercer, secretary to the 
board, and forwarded to Mr. Charlton Palmer, a solicitor in London, 
who was employed by the Company to apply to the King for such 
further orders and instructions to the government in Virginia, as 
might enable the Company to carry their grant into execution. The 
business was kept in a state of suspense for three years, when the 
Company resolved to send out an agent, with full powers to bring it 
as speedily as possible to a close. Colonel George Mercer was se- 
lected for this commission, and instructed to procure leave for the 
Company to take up their lands, according to the conditions of the 
original grant, or to obtain a reimbursement of the money, which had 





APPENDIX.] WALPOLE'S GRANT. 483 

been paid on the faith of that grant. He repaired to London ac- 
cordingly, and entered upon his charge. But at this time the coun- 
teracting interests of private individuals in Virginia, the claims of 
the officers and soldiers under Dinwiddie's proclamation, which ex- 
tended to lands within the Ohio Company's grant, and moreover the 
schemes and application of the proprietors of IValpole's Grant, were 
obstacles not to be overcome. Colonel Mercer remained six years in 
London, without making any apparent progress in the object of his 
mission, and at last he agreed to merge the interests of the Ohio 
Company in those of Walpole's, or the Grand Company, as it was 
called, on condition of securing to the former two shares in the lat- 
ter, amounting to one thirty-sixth part of the whole. These terms 
were not approved by the members of the Ohio Company in Virginia, 
nor was it clear, that Colonel Mercer's instructions authorized him to 
conclude such an arrangement. While the subject was still in agita- 
tation, the Revolutionary war came on, and put an end, not only to 
the controversy, but to the existence of the two companies. Thus 
the Ohio Company was in action only about four years, having 
never in reality revived after its first check, at the commencement of 
hostilities with the French and Indians on the frontiers. All per- 
sons concerned were losers to a considerable amount, though at its 
outset the scheme promised important advantages both to individuals, 
and to the country at large. The original records and papers of the 
Ohio Company are now in possession of Mr. Charles Fenton Mercer, 
of Virginia, by whose politeness I have been favored with the use of 
them in drawing up this brief outline.

WALPOLE'S GRANT. 

Immediately after the peace of 1763, a plan was suggested for set- 
tling the lands on the Ohio River. During that year a pamphlet was 
published in London, entitled " The Advantages of a Settlement 
upon the, Ohio in North America," in which the subject was ably 
argued. 

o 

In the year 1766, William Franklin, governor of New Jersey, and 
Sir William Johnson, Indian agent for the northern colonies, pro- 



484 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

posed a scheme for establishing a new colony on the Ohio. They 
wrote to Dr. Franklin, who was then in London, requesting his 
agency in endeavouring to procure a grant for this purpose, includ- 
ing the territory described in Washington's letter. He pressed the 
application for more than a year; but the change of ministers, and the 
contending interests of individuals, prevented its success, and the 
project seems to have been suspended till 1770, when it was re- 
newed. In April of that year, Mr. Thomas Pownall wrote to Sir 
William Johnson ; 

" A society of us, in which some of the first people in England are 
engaged, and in which you and Colonel Croghan are made original 
partakers, have concluded a bargain with the Treasury for a large 
tract of land lying and fronting on the Ohio (part of the lands lately 
ceded by the Indians to Great Britain), large enough for a govern- 
ment. Having it suggested to us by Lord Hillsborough, that it would 
be right that we should have a charter of government, in consequence 
of this bargain so concluded, we are next to apply to the Council- 
Board, that the grant may issue. We expect to meet with opposition, 
and some objections arising from the impressions made by such op- 
position, yet have no doubt of carrying this point, as we have settled 
the main point. As soon as the grant has issued, we are to apply to 
the Lords of Trade on the subject of the charter. It will naturally 
occur to you, that on this matter I shall be a little referred to, and 
the plan I propose is, to take the charter of the province of Massa- 
chusetts Bay for the model of our government, making some few 
alterations therein, which practice and experience have shown to be 
necessary, but such only as every constituent of the proposed prov- 
ince would wish ; such as every man, who desires to become a settler 
in it, would expect, be he of what denomination or description of re- 
ligionist he may. 

" From our peculiar situation, as a frontier province and as imme- 
diately connected with the Indian country, some peculiar additional 
department will be wanting in our form of government, and that is 
an Indian Department, formed for negotiation in matters of police, for 
a just and regular intercourse in trade, and so connected with the 
military branch, as to become a principal part in the time of war. 

" On the subject of this department, and its several necessary of- 
fices and officers, as a department interwoven into the constitution of 
the government of this province, I most earnestly beg you to give me 
your plan and explanatory sentiments, such as will establish a proper 
federate connexion and intercommunion between our government 
and the Indians, founded on the one hand in justice and true 



APPENDIX.] WALPOLE'S GRANT. 485 

policy towards those Indians, and on the other creative of the only 
security, which such a province so situated can or ought to confide 
in." MS. Letter. 

At the head of the Company was Mr. Thomas Walpole, an emi- 
nent banker in London, and from this circumstance the tract of land 
solicited was usually denominated " Walpole' 's Grant." The stock 
of the Association was divided into seventy-two shares, and many 
persons of distinction were concerned in it, both in England and 
America. The proprietors, who had the management of the business 
in procuring the grant, were Thomas Walpole, Thomas Pownall, 
Dr. Franklin, and Samuel Wharton. They had a strenuous oppo- 
nent in Lord Hillsborough, who wrote a report for the Board of Trade 
hostile to their petition ; though it would seem from Mr. Pownall's 
letter, that his opposition did not show itself in the first stages of the 
application. This report was answered by Dr. Franklin, in one of 
tbe ablest tracts he ever penned. (Franklin's Works, Vol. IV. p. 250.) 
It was so conclusive and satisfactory, that the petition was granted 
by the King in Council, notwithstanding the opposition of the Board 
of Trade. 

On the 18th of December, 1770, Colonel George Mercer, agent 
for the Ohio Company in England, wrote to Washington from Dub- 
lin ; "Before I left England, I mentioned my having agreed with, or 
I may rather say prevailed with, the great Land Company there, that 
the two hundred thousand acres, claimed by the officers of the Vir- 
ginia troops, should be allowed out of their grant." This arrange- 
ment was of course not known to Washington, when he wrote on 
the subject to Lord Botetourt, and afterwards to Lord Dunmore. 

Mr. Wharton wrote to Colonel Mercer, then in London, as follows, 
August 20th, 1772. " I do myself the pleasure to inform you, that 
on the 14th instant his Majesty in Council was pleased to approve of, 
and order to be carried into execution, the report of the Committee 
of the Privy Council, in favor of the grant of land to Mr. Walpole 
and his Associates, and that a new government should be established 
thereon." The increasing troubles between the mother country and 
the colonies prevented the ultimate completion of the project. But it 
was not abandoned till the beginning of the year 1776. The Ohio 
Company had been merged in this Grand Association, by the consent 
of their agent, though not with the entire approbation of the Com- 
pany. The grant covered a large part of the tract, which that Com- 
pany claimed, as well as the two hundred thousand acres pledged to 
the officers and soldiers of Washington's first campaign by Governor 
Dinwiddie's proclamation. Other particulars relating to this subject 
are contained in Franklin's Familiar Letters, &c. pp. 275 - 285.

WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



No. VIII. p. 387. 



Colonel Washington was at this time (June, 1774) in Williamsburg, 
where he had been attending the regular sitting of the House of Bur- 
gesses. A few days after the members had assembled, news came of the 
act of Parliament for shutting up the port of Boston, which was to take 
effect on the 1st of June. Much excitement was produced by this in- 
telligence ; and when the Burgesses met on the 24th of May, they 
passed an order, that the 1st (lay of June "should be set apart by 
that House, as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, devoutly to 
implore the divine interposition for averting the heavy calamity, 
which threatened destruction to their civil rights, and the evils of civil 
war, and to give them one heart and one mind firmly to oppose, by all 
just and proper means, every injury to American rights." Governor 
Dunmore was displeased at this order, and dissolved the House the 
next morning. 

The members, however, were not driven from their purpose. They 
assembled, to the number of eighty-nine, at the Raleigh tavern, on the 
25th of May, organized themselves, and drew up an Association, 
which they all signed, enumerating some of the grievances under 
which the colonies labored, assuming the cause of Boston as common 
to all, and recommending to the Committee of Correspondence in 
Virginia to correspond with the Committees of other colonies, on the 
expediency of appointing deputies to meet annually in a general Con- 
gress, at such place as should be thought most convenient. Wirt's 
Life of Patrick Henry, 3d edit. p. 95. 

Nor did the delegates disperse, till they had performed other acts 
of duty to their country, and even of complaisance to the Governor 
and his lady. They had made arrangements for honoring Lady 
Dunmore with a ball on the 27th of May, which were carried into 
execution with the same marks of attention and respect, as if nothing 
had occurred. The Burgesses also took care to observe with strict- 
ness their order for a fast. The following brief notes are from 
Washington's diary. 

" May IQth. Came to Williamsburg. Dined at the Governor's, 
and spent the evening at Mrs. Campbell's. 

"25Z/i. Dined and spent the evening at the Governor's. 

"%6th. Rode out with the Governor to his farm, and breakfasted 
with him there. 

"27^. Dined at the Treasurer's, and went to the ball given by 
the House of Burgesses to Lady Dunmore. '

"June 1st, Wednesday. Went to church, and fasted all day.

" 16th. Dined at the Governor's, and spent the evening at An- 
derson's. 

" 20A. Set off on my return home." 

On the 23th of May, as nothing more seemed necessary to be 
done, many of the delegates departed for their homes. But on Sunday 
morning, the 29th, letters were received in Williamsburg from Bos- 
ton, giving an account of the proceedings of a town meeting, in 
which it was recommended to the colonies to enter into a general 
association, or agreement, neither to export nor import articles of any 
kind to or from Great Britain. Twenty-five of the late delegates only 
were then in Williamsburg, among whom was Washington. They 
assembled the next day, and took the subject into consideration ; but, 
disagreeing on some points, they resolved to address a circular to the 
members of the different committees, and other gentlemen in the 
colony, which contained the following sentiments and recommenda- 
tion. " Most of the gentlemen present seemed to think it absolutely 
necessary for us to enlarge our late association, and that we ought to 
adopt the scheme of non-importation to a very large extent ; but we 
were divided in our opinions as to stopping our exports. We could 
not, however, being so small a proportion of our late associates, pre- 
sume to make any alteration in the terms of our general association, 
and we resolved to invite all the members of the late House of 
Burgesses to a general meeting in this city on the 1st day of August 
next. We fixed this distant day in the hopes of accommodating the 
meeting to every gentleman's private affairs, and that they might, in 
the mean time, have an opportunity of collecting the sense of their 
respective counties. The inhabitants of this city were convened yes- 
terday afternoon, and most cheerfully acceded to the measures we 
had adopted." 

This circular was signed by Peyton Randolph as moderator, and 
by the twenty-four other delegates then present. It was printed and 
distributed through the colony.

FAIRFAX COUNTY RESOLVES 



The draft, from which the following resolves are printed, I find 
among Washington's papers in the handwriting of George Mason, 
by whom they were probably drawn up ; yet as they were adopted by 
the committee of which Washington was chairman, and reported by 
him as moderator of the meeting, they may be presumed to express 
his opinions, formed on a perfect knowledge of the subject, and after 
cool deliberation. This may indeed be inferred from his letter to Mr. 
Bryan Fairfax, in which he intimates a doubt only as to the article fa- 
voring the idea of a further petition to the King. He was opposed 
to such a step, believing enough had been done in this way already ; 
but he yielded the point in tenderness to the more wavering resolu- 
tion of his associates. 

These resolves are framed with much care and ability, and ex- 
hibit the question then at issue, and ihe state of public feeling, in a 
manner so clear and forcible, as to give them a special claim to a 
place in the present work, in addition to the circumstance of their 
being the matured views of Washington, at the outset of the great 
revolutionary struggle, in which he was to act so conspicuous a part. 

"At a general Meeting of the Freeholders and Inhabitants of the 
County of Fairfax on Monday, the 18th day of July, 1774, at the 
Court-House ; George Washington, Chairman, and Robert Har- 
rison, Clerk of the said Meeting ; 

"1. Resolved, That this colony and dominion of Virginia cannot 
be considered as a conquered country ; and if it was, that the present 
inhabitants are the descendants not of the conquered, but of the con- 
querors. That the same was not settled at the national expense of 
England, but at the private expense of the adventurers, our ancestors, 
by solemn compact with, and under the auspices and protection of, 
the British crown ; upon which we are in every respect as dependent, 
as the people of Great Britain, and in the same manner subject to all 
his Majesty's just, legal, and constitutional prerogatives. That our 
ancestors, when they left their native land and settled in America, 
brought with them (even if the same had not been confirmed by 
charters) the civil constitution and form of government of the country 
they came from ; and were, by the laws of nature and nations, en- 



APPENDIX.] FAIRFAX COUNTY RESOLVES. 489 

titled to all its privileges, immunities, and advantages ; which have 
descended to us their posterity, and ought of right to be as fully en- 
joyed, as if we had still continued within the realm of England. 

" 2. Resolved, That the most important and valuable part of the 
British constitution, upon which its very existence depends, is the 
fundamental principle of the people's being governed by no laws, to 
which they have not given their consent by representatives freely 
chosen by themselves; who are affected by the laws they enact 
equally with their constituents ; to whom they are accountable, and 
whose burthens they share ; in which consists the safety and happi- 
ness of the community ; for if this part of the constitution was taken 
away, or materially altered, the government must degenerate either 
into an absolute and despotic monarchy, or a tyrannical aristocracy, 
and the freedom of the people be annihilated. 

" 3. Resolved, Therefore, as the inhabitants of the American colo- 
nies are not, and, from their situation, cannot be represented in the 
British Parliament, that the legislative power here can of right be exer- 
cised only by our own provincial Assemblies or Parliaments, subject to 
the assent or negative of the British crown, to be declared within some 
proper limited time. But as it was thought just and reasonable, that 
the people of Great Britain should reap advantages from these colo- 
nies adequate to the protection they afforded them, the British Parlia- 
ment have claimed and exercised the power of regulating our trade 
and commerce, so as to restrain our importing from foreign countries 
such articles as they could furnish us with, of their own growth or 
manufacture, or exporting to foreign countries such articles and por- 
tions of our produce, as Great Britain stood in need of, for her own 
consumption or manufactures. Such a power directed with wisdom 
and moderation, seems necessary for the general good of that great 
body politic, of which we are a part ; although in some degree repug- 
nant to the principles of the constitution. Under this idea our an- 
cestors submitted to it ; the experience of more than a century, dur- 
ing the government of his Majesty's royal predecessors, has proved 
its utility, and the reciprocal benefits flowing from it produced mutual 
uninterrupted harmony and good will, between the inhabitants of 
Great Britain and her colonies, who, during that long period, always 
considered themselves as one and the same people ; and though such 
a power is capable of abuse, and in some instances has been 
stretched beyond the original design and institution, yet to avoid 
strife and contention with our fellow-Subjects, and strongly impressed 
with the experience of mutual benefits, we always cheerfully acqui- 
esced in it, while the entire regulation of our internal policy, and giv-

ing and granting our own money, were preserved to our own provin- 
cial legislatures. 

" 4. Resolved, That it is the duty of these colonies, on all emer- 
gencies, to contribute, in proportion to their abilities, situation, and 
circumstances, to the necessary charge of supporting and defending 
the British empire, of which they are part ; that while we are treated 
upon an equal footing with our fellow-subjects, the motives of self- 
interest and preservation will be a sufficient obligation, as was evi- 
dent through the course of the last war; and that no argument can 
be fairly applied to the British Parliament's taxing us, upon a pre- 
sumption that we should refuse a just and reasonable contribution, 
but will equally operate in justification of the executive power taxing 
the people of England, upon a supposition of their representatives 
refusing to grant the necessary supplies. 

" 5. Resolved, That the claim, lately assumed and exercised by 
the British Parliament, of making all such laws as they think fit, to 
govern the people of these colonies, and to extort from us our money 
without our consent, is not only diametrically contrary to the first 
principles of the constitution, and the original compacts by which 
we are dependent upon the British crown and government; but is 
totally incompatible with the privileges of a free people and the natu- 
ral rights of mankind, will render our own legislatures merely nomi- 
nal and nugatory, and is calculated to reduce us from a state of free- 
dom and happiness to slavery and misery. 

" 6. Resolved, That taxation and representation are in their 
nature inseparable; that the right of withholding, or of giving and 
granting their own money, is the only effectual security to a free peo- 
ple, against the encroachments of despotism and tyranny ; and that 
whenever they yield the one, they must quickly fall a prey to the 
other. 

" 7. Resolved, That the powers over the people of America now 
claimed by the British House of Commons, in whose election we 
have no share, on whose determinations we can have no influence, 
whose information must be always defective and often false, who in 
many instances may have a separate, and in some an opposite inter- 
est to ours, and who are removed from those impressions of tender- 
ness and compassion arising from personal intercourse and connex- 
ions, which soften the rigors of the most despotic governments, must, 
if continued, establish the most grievous and intolerable species of 
tyranny and oppression, that ever was inflicted upon mankind. 

" 8. Resolved, That it is our greatest wish and inclination, as 
well as interest, to continue our connexion with, and dependence 



APPENDIX.] FAIRFAX COUNTY RESOLVES. 491 

upon the British government ; but though we are its subjects, we will 
use every means, which Heaven hath given us to prevent our becom- 
ing its slaves. 

" 9. Resolved, That there is a premeditated design and system, 
formed and pursued by the British ministry, to introduce an arbitrary 
government into his Majesty's American dominions ; to which end 
they are artfully prejudicing our sovereign, and inflaming the minds 
of our fellow-subjects in Great Britain, by propagating the most malev- 
olent falsehoods, particularly that there is an intention in the Amer- 
ican colonies to set up for independent states ; endeavouring at the 
same time, by various acts of violence and oppression, by sudden and 
repeated dissolutions of our Assemblies, whenever they presume to 
examine the illegality of ministerial mandates, or deliberate on the 
violated rights of their constituents, and by breaking in upon the 
American charters, to reduce us to a state of desperation, and dis- 
solve the original compacts by which our ancestors bound themselves 
and their posterity to remain dependent upon the British crown ; 
which measures, unless effectually counteracted, will end in the ruin 
both of Great Britain and her colonies. 

" 10. Resolved, That the several acts of Parliament for raising a 
revenue upon the people of America without their consent, the creat- 
ing new and dangerous jurisdictions here, the taking away our trials 
by jury, the ordering persons, upon criminal accusations, to be tried 
in another country than that in which the fact is charged to have 
been committed, the act inflicting ministerial vengeance upon the 
town of Boston, and the two bills lately brought into Parliament for 
abrogating the charter of the province of Massachusetts Bay, and for 
the protection and encouragement of murderers in the said province, 
are part of the abovementioned iniquitous system. That the inhabi- 
tants of the town of Boston are now suffering in the common cause 
of all British America, and are justly entitled to its support and assis- 
tance; and therefore that a subscription ought immediately to be 
opened, and proper persons appointed in every county of this colony 
to purchase provisions, and consign them to some gentlemen of 
character in Boston, to be distributed among the poorer sort of people 
there. 

"11. Resolved, That we will cordially join with our friends and 
brethren of this and the other colonies, in such measures as shall be 
judged most effectual for procuring redress of our grievances, and 
that upon obtaining such redress, if the destruction of the tea at Bos- 
ton be regarded as an invasion of private property, we shall be wil- 
ling to contribute towards paying the East India Company the value ; 



. 

492 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

but as we consider the said Company as the tools and instruments of 
oppression in the hands of government, and the cause of our present 
distress, it is the opinion of this meeting, that the people of these 
colonies should forbear all further dealings with them, by refusing to 
purchase their merchandise, until that peace, safety, and good order, 
which they have disturbed, be perfectly restored. And that all tea 
now in this colony, or which shall be imported into it shipped before 
the 1st day of September next, should be deposited in some stor 
house to be appointed by the respective committees of each county, 
until a sufficient sum of money be raised by subscription to reimburse 
the owners the value, and then to be publicly burned and destroyed ; 
and if the same is not paid for and destroyed as aforesaid, that it re- 
main in the custody of the said committees, at the risk of the owners, 
until the act of Parliament imposing a duty upon tea, for raising a 
revenue in America, be repealed ; and immediately afterwards be 
delivered unto the several proprietors thereof, their agents, or at- 
torneys. 

" 12. Resolved, That nothing will so much contribute to defeat 
the pernicious designs of the common enemies of Great Britain and 
her colonies, as a firm union of the latter, who ought to regard every 
act of violence or oppression inflicted upon any one of them, as aimed 
at all ; and to effect this desirable purpose, that a Congress should be 
appointed, to consist of deputies from all the colonies, to concert a 
general and uniform plan for the defence and preservation of our 
common rights, and continuing the connexion and dependence of 
the said colonies upon Great Britain, under a just, lenient, perma- 
nent, and constitutional form of government. 

" 13. Resolved, That our most sincere and cordial thanks be 
given to the patrons and friends of liberty in Great Britain, for their 
spirited and patriotic conduct, in support of our constitutional rights 
and privileges, and their generous efforts to prevent the present dis- 
tress and calamity of America. 

" 14. Resolved, That every little jarring interest and dispute, 
which has ever happened between these colonies, should be buried in 
eternal oblivion ; that all manner of luxury and extravagance ought 
immediately to be laid aside, as totally inconsistent with the threaten- 
ing and gloomy prospect before us ; that it is the indispensable duty 
of all the gentlemen and men of fortune to set examples of tempe- 
rance, fortitude, frugality, and industry, and give every encourage- 
ment in their power, particularly by subscriptions and premiums, to 
the improvement of arts and manufactures in America ; that great 
care and attention should be had to the cultivation of flax, cotton, 




APPENDIX.] FAIRFAX COUNTY RESOLVES. 493 

and other materials for manufactures ; and we recommend it to such 
of the inhabitants, as have large stocks of sheep, to sell to their 
neighbours at a moderate price, as the most certain means of speedily 
increasing our breed of sheep, and quantity of wool. 

" 15. Resolved, That until American grievances be redressed, 
by restoration of our just rights and privileges, no goods or merchan- 
dise whatsoever ought to be imported into this colony, which shall be 
shipped from Great Britain or Ireland after the 1st day of September 
next, except linens not exceeding fifteen pence per yard, coarse wool- 
len cloth, not exceeding two shillings sterling per yard, nails, wire and 
wire cards, needles and pins, paper, saltpetre, and medicines, which 
may be imported until the 1st day of September, 1776; and if any 
goods or merchandise, other than those hereby excepted, should be 
shipped from Great Britain, after the time aforesaid, to this colony, 
that the same, immediately upon their arrival, should either be sent 
back again, by the owners, their agents, or attorneys, or stored and 
deposited in some warehouse, to be appointed by the committee for 
each respective county, and there kept, at the risk and charge of the 
owners, to be delivered to them, when a free importation of goods 
hither shall again take place. And that the merchants and venders 
of goods and merchandise within this colony ought not to take ad- 
vantage of our present distress, but continue to sell the goods and 
merchandise which they now have, or which may be shipped to them 
before the 1st day of September next, at the same rates and prices 
they have been accustomed to do, within one year last past ; and if 
any person shall sell such goods on any other terms than above ex* 
pressed, that no inhabitant of this colony should at any time, for ever 
thereafter, deal with him, his agent, factor, or storekeepers for any 
commodity whatsoever. 

" 16. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the 
merchants and venders of goods and merchandise within this colony 
should take an oath, not to sell or dispose of any goods or merchan- 
dise whatsoever, which may be shipped from Great Britain after the 
1st day of September next as aforesaid, except the articles before ex- 
cepted, and that they will, upon receipt of such prohibited goods, 
either send the same back again by the first opportunity, or deliver 
them to the committees in the respective counties, to be deposited in 
some warehouse, at the risk and charge of the owners, until they, 
their agents, or factors be permitted to take them away by the said 
committees ; the names of those who refuse to take such oath to be 
advertised by the respective committees in the counties wherein they 
reside. And to the end that the inhabitants of this colony may know 

VOL. II. PP 



494 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. 

what merchants and venders of goods and merchandise have taken 
such oath, that the respective committees should grant a certificate 
thereof to every such person who shall take the same. 

" 17. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that during 
our present difficulties and distress, no slaves ought to be imported 
into any of the British colonies on this continent ; and we take this 
opportunity of declaring our most earnest wishes to see an entire sto 
for ever put to such a wicked, cruel, and unnatural trade. 

" 18. Resolved, That no kind of lumber should be exported from 
this colony to the West Indies, until America be restored to her con- 
stitutional rights and liberties, if the other colonies will accede to a 
like resolution ; and that it be recommended to the general Congress 
to appoint as early a day as possible for stopping such export. 

" 19. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, if Ameri- 
can grievances be not redressed before the 1st day of November, 
1775, that all exports of produce from the several colonies to Great 
Britain should cease ; and to carry the said resolution more effectu- 
ally into execution, that we will not plant or cultivate any tobacco, 
after the crop now growing; provided the same measure shall be 
adopted by the other colonies on this continent, as well those who 
have heretofore made tobacco, as those who have not. And it is our 
opinion also, if the Congress of deputies from the several colonies 
shall adopt the measure of non-exportation to Great Britain, as the 
people will be thereby disabled from paying their debts, that no judg- 
ments should be rendered by the courts in the said colonies for any 
debt, after information of the said measure's being determined upon. 

" 20. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting that a 
solemn covenant and association should be entered into by the in- 
habitants of all the colonies upon oath, that they will not, after the 
times which shall be respectively agreed on at the general Congress, 
export any manner of lumber to the West Indies, nor any of their 
produce to Great Britain, or sell or dispose of the same to any person 
who shall not have entered into the said covenant and association ; 
and also that they will not import or receive any goods or merchan- 
dise which shall be shipped from Great Britain after the 1st day of 
September next, other than the before enumerated articles, nor buy 
or purchase any goods, except as before excepted, of any person 
whatsoever, who shall not have taken the oath herein before recom- 
mended to be taken by the merchants and venders of goods, nor buy 
or purchase any slaves hereafter imported into any part of this con- 
tinent until a free exportation and importation be again resolved on 
by a majority of the representatives or deputies of the colonies. And 



APPENDIX.] FAIRFAX COUNTY RESOLVES. 495 

that the respective committees of the counties in each colony, so soon 
as the covenant and association becomes general, publish by adver- 
tisements in their several counties, a list of the names of those (if any 
such there be) who will not accede thereto ; that such traitors to their 
country may be publicly known and detested. 

" 21. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that this 
and the other associating colonies should break off all trade, inter- 
course, and dealings, with that colony, province, or town, which shall 
decline or refuse to agree to the plan, which shall be adopted by the 
general Congress. 

" 22. Resolved, That should the town of Boston be forced to sub- 
mit to the late cruel and oppressive measures of government, that we 
shall not hold the same to be binding upon us, but will, notwithstand-. 
ing, religiously maintain and inviolably adhere to such measures as 
shall be concerted by the general Congress, for the preservation of 
our lives, liberties, and fortunes. 

"23. Resolved, That it be recommended to the deputies of the 
general Congress to draw up and transmit an humble and dutiful pe- 
tition and remonstrance to his Majesty, asserting with decent firm- 
ness our just and constitutional rights and privileges ; lamenting the 
fatal necessity of being compelled to enter into measures disgusting 
to his Majesty and his Parliament, or injurious to our fellow-subjects 
in Great Britain ; declaring, in the strongest terms, our duty and af- 
fection to his Majesty's person, family, and government, and our de- 
sire to continue our dependence upon great Britain ; and most hum- 
bly conjuring and beseeching his Majesty not to reduce his faithful 
subjects of America to a state of desperation, and to reflect, that from 
our sovereign there can be but one appeal. And it is the opinion of 
this meeting, that after such petition, and remonstrance shall have 
been presented to his Majesty, the same should be printed in the 
public papers, in all the principal towns in Great Britain. 

"24. Resolved, That George Washington and Charles Broad- 
water, lately elected our representatives to serve in the General As- 
sembly, be appointed to attend the convention at Williamsburg on 
the 1st day of August next, and present these Resolves, as the sense 
of the people of this county, upon the measures proper to be taken in 
the present alarming and dangerous situation of America." 

Such were the opinions of Washington, and his associates in Vir- 
ginia, at the beginning of the revolutionary contest. The seventeenth 
resolve merits attention, from the pointed manner in which it con- 
demns the slave-trade.

AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. 

It is not easy to determine at what precise date the idea of inde- 
pendence was first entertained by the principal persons in America. 
English writers, arguing from the conduct of the colonists, have com- 
monly charged them with secretly harbouring such designs at a very 
early period. This is not probable. The spirit and form of their 
institutions, it is true, led them to act frequently as an independent 
people, and to set up high claims in regard to their rights and privi- 
leges, but there is no sufficient evidence to prove, that any province, 
or any number of prominent individuals, entertained serious thoughts 
of separating entirely from the mother country, till very near the ac- 
tual commencement of the war of the revolution. 

Chalmers, who had ample means of research among the papers in 
the Board of Trade, and whose historical veracity claims respect, has 
spoken explicitly on this subject. In reference to the change, which 
took place in the affairs of the Board of Trade, in 1766, he observes; 
" None of the statesmen of that period, nor those of the preceding or 
subsequent times, had any suspicion, that there lay among the docu- 
ments in the Board of Trade, and Paper Office, the most satisfactory 
proofs, from the epoch of the revolution in 1688, throughout every 
reign, and during every administration, of the settled purpose of the 
revolted colonies to acquire direct independence" Opinions of 
Eminent Laicyers, &c. Preface, p. xvi. But this statement, un- 
supported as it is by the citation of any examples, is too vague for 
history. It indicates the impression left on the mind of Chalmers, 
but affords nothing in the nature of testimony. 

Gordon relates the following anecdote of a conversation, said to 
have taken place in the year 1759, between Mr. Pratt, afterwards 
Lord Camden, and Dr. Franklin, but he cites no authority. " For 
all what you Americans say of your loyalty," observed Mr. Pratt, " I 
know you will one day throw off your dependence upon this country ; 
and, notwithstanding your boasted affection to it, will set up for inde- 
pendence." Franklin answered, " No such idea is entertained in the 
mind of the Americans; and no such idea will ever enter their heads, 
unless you grossly abuse them." " Very true," replied Mr. Pratt, 
" that is one of the main causes I see will happen, and will produce 
the event." Gordon's Hist, of the Am. Revolution, Vol. I. p. 136. 

As early as the year 1774, Dr. Franklin began to talk of a " total

emancipation" or independence. Memoir of Josiali Quincy, Jr. 
p. 250. And Mr. Wirt represents Patrick Henry, as uttering the 
same sentiment anterior to the meeting of the first Continental Con- 
gress. Yet the manner in which it was received by his hearers 
indicates, that it was to them a novel and unexpected doctrine ; " at 
the word independence the company appeared to be startled, for they 
had never heard any thing of the kind before even suggested." 
Life of Patrick Henry, p. 94. 

Washington, in his letter to Captain Mackenzie, denies, in very 
strong terms, that such was the design of any persons, so far as his 
knowledge extended. No man, perhaps, was better informed on the 
subject by mingling in the society of others ; and it may hence be 
confidently inferred, that the topic of independence was not openly 
broached by the members of the first Congress, even in their private 
discourse among themselves. That he and his immediate friends 
had no such object in view is manifest, from a clause in the Fairfax 
County Resolves, passed on the 18th of July preceding, at a public 
meeting over which he presided. It is there stated as a cause of 
complaint, "that the British ministry are artfully prejudicing our 
sovereign, and inflaming the minds of our fellow-subjects in Great 
Britain, by propagating the most malevolent falsehoods, particularly 
that there is an intention in the American colonies to set up for inde- 
pendent states" It was the opinion of Washington, and of the 
framers of these resolves, that the colonies had the power, by with- 
holding their support of British commerce, to inflict so much distress 
on the "people of Great Britain, as to rouse the government to a sense 
of the colonial wrongs, and produce a speedy change in their meas- 
ures. And it was moreover supposed, that spirited resolutions, show- 
ing the almost universal sense of the people, that the acts of the 
British Parliament in regard to them were oppressive and unjust, 
would tend to hasten so desirable a result. Such were no doubt the 
views entertained by all classes of people, and the motives actuating 
them in the primary movements of the revolution. 

The subject being somewhat curious, as well as interesting in its 
historical aspect, I thought it not amiss to obtain the impressions of 
Mr. Madison, who could not fail to have a vivid recollection of the 
popular feeling and principal events in Virginia at the period in ques- 
tion, and to know the sentiments of the political leaders. The fol- 
lowing is an extract from his letter, dated January 5th, 1828. 

" You wish me to say whether I believe, ' that at the beginning of 
the revolution, or at the assembling of the first Congress, the leaders 
of that day were resolved on independence.' I readily express my 

VOL. ii. 63 PP * 



498 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX 

entire belief, that they were not; though I must admit, that my 
means of information were more limited, than may have been the 
case with others still living to answer the inquiry. My first entrance 
on public life was in May, 1776, when I became a member of the 
Convention in Virginia, which instructed her delegates in Congress 
to propose the Declaration of Independence. Previous to that date I 
was not in sufficient communication with any under the denomina- 
tion of leaders, to learn their sentiments, or views, on that cardinal 
subject. 

" I can only say, therefore, that so far as ever came to my knowl- 
edge, no one of them ever avowed, or was understood to entertain a 
pursuit of independence, at the assembling of the first Congress, or 
for a considerable period thereafter. It has always been my impres- 
sion, that a reestablishment of the colonial relations to the parent 
country, as they were previous to the controversy, was the real object 
of every class of the people, till despair of obtaining it, and the exas- 
perating effects of the war, and the manner of conducting it, prepared 
the minds of all for the event declared on the 4th of July, 1776, as 
preferable, with all its difficulties and perils, to the alternative of sub- 
mission to a claim of power, at once external, unlimited, irresponsible, 
and under every temptation to abuse from interest, ambition, and re- 
venge. If there were individuals, who aimed at independence, their 
views must have been confined to their own bosoms, or to a very con- 
fidential circle." 

It was the belief, before the meeting of the Congress, particularly 
of the more cautious and moderate, that petitions to the King and 
Parliament by a body of representatives assembled from all parts of 
the colonies, would be respected, and in the end procure redress. 
They, on the contrary, who, like Washington, had no confidence in 
the success of this measure, looked forward to the probable issue of 
arms, but still without any other anticipations than, by a resolute vin- 
dication of their rights, to effect a change in the conduct and policy 
of the British government, and restore the colonies to their former con- 
dition. It was not till these petitions were rejected with a show of 
indifference, if not of contempt, that the eyes of all were opened to 
the necessity of unconditional submission, or united resistance. 
From that time the word independence was boldly pronounced, and 
soon became a familiar sound to the ears of the whole people. 

On the 10th of November, 1775, Mr. Richard Penn, who had 
been governor of Pennsylvania, and had left Philadelphia in the 
preceding July, was examined before the House of Lords, while the 
petition from Congress, which had been brought over and presented 



APPENDIX.] AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. 499 

by Mr. Perm, in conjunction with the agents for the colonies, was 
under discussion. The following questions and answers occur in the 
examination. 

" Question. Are you personally acquainted with many of the 
members of Congress ? 

" Answer. I am acquainted with almost all the members of the 
Congress. 

" Quest. Do you think they levy and carry on this war for the 
purpose of establishing an independent empire 1 

" Ans. I think they do not carry on the war for independency. 
I never heard them breathe sentiments of that nature. 

" Quest. For what purpose do you believe they have taken up 
arms? 

" Ans. In defence of their liberties." Parliamentary Debates, 
November, 1775. 

It is a curious fact, that the ministers had at this moment in their 
hands two intercepted letters, written by Mr. John Adams in Con- 
gress, which expressed sentiments quite at variance with the testi- 
mony of Mr. Penn. These letters were dated on the 24th of July, 
only two weeks later than the petition to the King, taken to England 
by Mr. Penn, which was approved in Congress on the 8th. They 
were intercepted in crossing the ferry at Newport, and sent on board 
Admiral Graves's fleet, whence they found their way to Lord Dart- 
mouth. The originals are now in the State Paper Office. One of 
these letters was from Mr. Adams to his wife, in which he said ; 

" The business I have had on my mind has been as great and im- 
portant, as can be entrusted to one man, and the difficulty and in- 
tricacy of it are prodigious. When fifty or sixty men have a consti- 
tution to form for a great empire, at the same time that they have a 
country of fifteen hundred miles in extent to fortify, millions to arm 
and train, a naval power to begin, an extensive commerce to regulate, 
numerous tribes of Indians to negotiate with, a standing army of 
twenty-seven thousand men to raise, pay, victual, and officer, I really 
shall pity those fifty or sixty men." 

The other letter was to James Warren, at that time Speaker of the 
Massachusetts Assembly, and contained the following declarations. 

" We ought to have had in our hands a month ago the whole legis- 
lative, executive, and judicial power of the whole continent, and have 
completely modelled a constitution ; to have raised a naval power and 
opened all our ports wide ; to have arrested every friend to government 
on the continent, and held them as hostages for the poor victims in 
Boston ; and then opened the door as wide as possible for peace and re- 



500 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

conciliation. After this, they might have petitioned, and negotiated, 
and addressed, if they would. Is all this extravagant? Is it wild ? 
Is it not the soundest policy 1 " 

With sentiments like these, coming from a prominent member of 
Congress, it is no wonder that the ministry should be puzzled to 
reconcile the doctrines and assertions of the petition to the King, in 
which that body express their loyalty, and desire an opportunity " of 
evincing the sincerity of their professions, by every testimony of de- 
votion becoming the most dutiful subjects and the most affectionate 
colonists." No charge of insincerity, however, can attach to Mr. 
Adams. It is. well known, that he had little sympathy with the 
party, who insisted on this last petition, and that he and others 
yielded to their associates, with the view of preserving peace and har- 
mony within the walls of Congress, as the only means of ultimate 
union and success. At this stage of affairs they hoped nothing from 
petitions, and anticipated a remedy of evils from no other source, 
than strong and determined measures on the part of the representa- 
tives of the people. Whatever may have been the opinions or wishes 
of other members of Congress, it is hardly possible, that Mr. Adams 
could have written the above letters without looking forward at least 
to the possibility of a speedy separation, and an independent form of 
government. The fact of their being in the hands of the ministry, 
when the petition came under the notice of Parliament, may serve as 
a key to some of the proceedings on the subject. 

In tracing this matter farther, we shall find the opinions of Wash- 
ington, Madison, and Penn, in regard to a scheme of independence 
among the colonists anterior to the beginning of the revolution, con- 
firmed by other testimony of the highest order. In a letter, which 
Dr. Franklin wrote to his son, dated March 22d, 1775, he relates a 
conversation he had held in the August preceding with Lord Chat- 
ham, in which that statesman spoke of the prevailing belief in En- 
gland, that the colonies aimed at setting themselves up as an inde- 
pendent state. "I assured him," said Franklin, "that having more 
than once travelled almost from one end of the continent to the other, 
and kept a great variety of company, eating, drinking, and convers- 
ing with .them freely, I never had heard in any conversation from,any 
person, drunk or sober, the least expression of a wish for a separa- 
tion, or a hint that such a thing would be advantageous to America." 
Franklin's Works, Vol. I. p. 278. 

Again, Mr Jay, remarking on certain parts of Botta's History of 
the American Revolution, in a letter to Mr. Otis, January 13th, 1821, 
thus expressed himself. "During the course of my life, and until 



APPENDIX.] AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. 501 

after the second petition of Congress, in 1775, I never did hear an 
American of any class, or of any description, express a wish for the 
independence of the colonies." "It has always been, and still is my 
opinion and belief, that our country was prompted and impelled to 
independence by necessity, and not by choice. They, who know how 
we were then circumstanced, know from whence that necessity re- 
sulted." Life of John Jay, Vol. II. p. 412. 

We have likewise the opinions, uttered on the same occasion, of 
two other persons not less qualified to judge, than any that have been 
mentioned. " That there existed a general desire of independence 
of the crown," says Mr. John Adams, "in any part of America, before 
the revolution, is as far from the truth as the zenith from the nadir." 
"For my own part, there was not a moment during the revolution, 
when I would not have given every thing I possessed for a restoration 
to the state of things before the contest began, provided we could 
have had a sufficient security for its continuance." Ibid. p. 416. 
And Mr. Jefferson affirmed, " What, eastward of New York, 
might have been the dispositions towards England before the com- 
mencement of hostilities, I know not ; before that I never had heard a 
whisper of a disposition to separate from Great Britain ; and after that, 
its possibility was contemplated with affliction by all." Ibid. p. 417. 

This mass of testimony, derived from separate sources, coincident 
in every particular, vouched by the first names in American history, 
and the principal actors in producing a separation, is perfectly con- 
clusive on this point. It is moreover established, as Mr. Jay has 
remarked, by all the public documents and proceedings of the colo- 
nial legislatures, in which assurances of loyalty and allegiance are 
uniform and cordial. Any opinion, therefore, that the spirit of inde- 
pendence had an early origin, and a progressive growih, with a direct 
aim to a separation, or the prospect of such an event, must be a mere 
inference, sanctioned only by the circumstances of the free institutions 
of the colonies, and the tendency of a people. under such institutions 
to self-government and a system independent of foreign control. 

The following curious and characteristic letter from John Adams 
to Rfchard Henry Lee was written in Congress, November 15th, 
1775, nearly eight months before the declaration of independence. 
A copy was taken from the original by a merchant in Virginia, and 
forwarded to his friend in Glasgow, by whom it was transmitted to 
the British ministry. It is now in the State Paper Office. 

" The course of events," says Mr. Adams, " naturally turns the 
thoughts of gentlemen in common to the subjects of legislation and 
jurisprudence ; and it is a current problem, what form of government 



502 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

is most readily and easily adopted by a colony upon a sudden emer- 
gency. Nature and experience have already pointed out a solution 
of this problem in the choice of conventions and committees of safety. 
Nothing is wanting, in addition to these, to make a complete govern- 
ment, but the choice of magistrates for the administration of justice. 
Taking nature and experience for my guide, I have formed the fol- 
lowing sketch, which may be varied in any one particular an infinite 
number of ways, so as to accommodate it to the genius, temper, prin- 
ciples, and even prejudices of different people. 

" A legislative, executive, and judicial power comprehends the 
whole of what is meant and understood by government. It is by bal- 
ancing each of these powers against the other two, that the effort in 
human nature towards tyranny can alone be checked and restrained, 
and any degree of freedom preserved in the constitution. 

" Let a full and free representation be chosen for a house of com- 
mons. Let the house choose by ballot twelve, sixteen, twenty-four, or 
twenty-eight persons, either members of the house, or from the people 
at large, as the electors please, for a council. Let the house and 
council by joint ballot choose a governor annually, or septennially, as 
you like. Let the governor, council, and house be each a distinct 
and independent branch of legislation, and have a negative on all 
laws. Let the lieutenant-governor, secretary, commissary, attorney- 
general, and solicitor-general, be chosen annually by joint ballot of 
both houses. Let the governor, with seven counsellors, be a quorum. 
Let all officers and magistrates, civil and military, be nominated and 
appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of his 
council. Let no officers be appointed but by a general council. Let 
the judges, at least of the superior court, be incapacitated by law 
from holding any share in the legislative or executive powers, and let 
their commissions be during good behaviour, and their salaries ascer- 
tained and established by law. Let the governor have the command 
of the army, militia, forts. Let the colony have a seal, and affix it to 
all commissions. 

" In this way, a single month is sufficient, without the least con- 
vulsion or animosity, to accomplish a total revolution. If it is 
thought more beneficial, a law may be made by the new legislature, 
leaving to the people at large the privilege of choosing their governor 
and council annually, as soon as matters get into a more quiet course. 
Adopting a plan similar to this, human nature will appear in its 
proper glory, asserting its own real dignity, putting down tyrannies 
at a single exertion, and erecting such new fabrics, as it thinks best 
calculated to promote its happiness."

BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM A DIARY. 

Although Washington could hardly be considered a man of read- 
ing, or one who gathered knowledge from a deep study of books, yet 
few were better informed on all the practical topics of life, or had a 
more perfect understanding of the political principles on which the 
English government was founded, and of the true merits of the con- 
troversy between Great Britain and the colonies. No gentleman 
associated more constantly and intimately with men of the first tal- 
ents and attainments, or was more eager or better qualified to profit 
by such an intercourse. At Mount Vernon he lived in the exercise 
of an open and generous hospitality, which drew to his house the 
best part of the society of Virginia and Maryland, as well as strangers 
from other colonies. He also spent a portion of every year at Wil- 
liamsburg, as a member of the House of Burgesses, where he fre- 
quented the circles of wealth and fashion, at the same time that he 
was brought into contact with men of powerful minds in the transac- 
tion of public affairs. His manner of life was a school, in which 
every day increased his insight into human character, and sharpened 
his faculties of observation and judgment, always acute and always 
active. 

The following meagre hints from his Diary, during the whole time 
of his attendance at the first Congress in Philadelphia, are of no other 
value, than as showing how he passed his time while not occupied 
with his public duties. It will be seen, that he was constantly abroad, 
in company with the most enlightened society, and thus in a condition 
to collect the sentiments of all parties on the great subjects, which 
then agitated the country. This trait in his habits is worth recording, 
and worth remembering, as it is a key to many incidents in his 
career, not easily explained without it. In the present instance, also, 
these entries in his Diary afford an evidence of the high consider- 
ation in which he was already held, if we may judge from the eager- 
ness with which his company was sought. 

Mr. Pendleton and Patrick Henry spent a day and night with him 
at Mount Vernon, on their way to Philadelphia, and they all set off 
together for that place on the 31st of August.

The Congress met at Carpenter's Hall, in Philadelphia, on the 5th 
of September, and was dissolved on the 26th of October. Washington 
took a deep interest in the transactions of this body, and gave his 
unremitted attendance during its sittings. It was his custom thor- 
oughly to understand every important measure in which he engaged, 
to examine its grounds, and study and weigh its details. There is 
now among his papers a copy of the petition to the King, sent out by 
this Congress, carefully and handsomely written with his own hand. 
This was his habit through life. When he wished to possess himself 
perfectly of the contents of any paper, he would copy it in a fair 
hand, and apparently with deliberation, that no point might escape 
his notice, or fail of making its due impression. Another habit akin 
to this was to condense documents and papers, by writing down their 
substance in few words, and always in a distinct and clear method. 
Many papers of both these kinds have been preserved, particularly on 
political subjects after the revolution, to which we shall have occasion 
to recur hereafter. 

The opinion entertained of him, by his associates in the first Con-

gress, may perhaps be gathered from the following anecdote related 
by Mr. Wirt. 

" Congress arose in October, and Mr. Henry returned to his na- 
tive county. Here, as was natural, he was surrounded by his neigh- 
bours, who were eager to hear not only what had been done, but 
what kind of men had composed that illustrious body. He answered 
their inquiries with all his wonted kindness and candor ; and, having 
been asked by one of them, ' whom he thought the greatest man in 
Congress/ he replied, * If you speak of eloquence, Mr. Rutledge 
of South Carolina is by far the greatest orator ; but if you speak of 
solid information and sound judgment, Colonel Washington is, un- 
questionably, the greatest man on that floor.' Such was the pene- 
tration, which, at that early period of Washington's life, could pierce 
through his retiring modesty and habitual reserve, and estimate so 
correctly the unrivalled worth of his character." Life of Patrick 
Henry, p. 113. 




No. XII. p. 406. 
INDEPENDENT COMPANIES. 

It had been a custom, of several years' standing in Virginia, for 
persons in the different counties to form themselves into independent 
companies, for the purpose of military discipline. On the first pros- 
pect of hostilities, these companies were prepared to act, and became 
zealous in the cause of liberty. They chose their own officers, and, 
according to the plan of their original organization, they seem to 
have been under no other command, than that of their captains re- 
spectively. They adopted such uniforms, as they thought proper, 
and provided themselves with arms, colors, and drums. As soon as 
war was apprehended, many of these companies solicited Colonel 
Washington to take them under his command. The following are 
the resolutions of the Independent Company of Cadets, in Prince 
William county, dated November llth, 1774, and signed by William 
Grayson, as captain. 

" Resolved, That the motto of this company shall be, Aut liber 
out nullus. 

"Resolved, unanimously, that Thomas Blackburn, Richard Gra- 
ham, and Philip Richard Francis Lee, gentlemen, do wait on Colonel 



APPENDIX.] INDEPENDENT COMPANIES. 507 

George Washington, and request him to take the command of this 
company, as their field-officer, and that he will be pleased to direct 
the fashion of their uniform ; that they also acquaint him with the 
motto of their company, which is to be fixed on their colors." 

He always acceded to these requests, and assisted as far as he 
could in procuring equipments. While attending the first Con- 
gress in Philadelphia, he made contracts for articles of this sort for 
the independent company of Fairfax county. He reviewed the com- 
panies in different places, and animated them by his counsel and ex- 
ample to become expert in military science and tactics. 

On one occasion he was very near being brought into an active 
command of these companies. The hasty step of Governor Dunmore 
in causing the powder to be secretly removed from the magazine in 
Williamsburg, and placed on board one of his Majesty's ships in the 
river, roused the indignation, and kindled the martial spirit, of the 
whole colony. The independent companies flew instantly to their 
arms, and resolved to march to Williamsburg, and compel the Gov- 
ernor by force to restore the powder. The following letters will 
show the tone of feeling that prevailed. 

TO COLONEL GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

" Fredericksburg, 25 April, 1775. 
" SIR, 

" By intelligence from Williamsburg it appears, that Captain Col- 
lins of his Majesty's navy, at the head of fifteen marines, carried off 
the powder from the magazine in that city on the night of Thursday 
last, and conveyed it on board his vessel by order of the Governor. 
The gentlemen of the Independent Company of this town think this 
first public insult is not to be tamely submitted to, and determine, 
with your approbation, to join any other bodies of armed men, who 
are willing to appear in support of the honor of Virginia, as well as 
to secure the military stores yet remaining in the magazine. It is 
proposed to march from hence on Saturday next for Williamsburg, 
properly accoutred as light-horsemen. 

" Expresses are sent off to inform the commanding officers of com- 
panies in the adjacent counties of this our resolution, and we shall 
wait prepared for your instructions and their assistance. 
" We are, Sir, your humble servants, 

"HUGH MERCER, 

"G. WEEDON, 

" ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD, 

"JoiiN WILLIS. 



508 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

"P. S. As we are not sufficiently supplied with powder, it may be 
proper to request of the gentlemen, who join us from Fairfax or Prince 
William, to come provided with an over proportion of that article." 

TO COLONEL GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

" Charlottesville, 29 April, 1775. 
" SIR, 

" The county of Albemarle in general, and the gentlemen volun- 
teers in particular, are truly alarmed, and highly incensed with the 
unjustifiable proceedings of Lord Dunmore, who, we are informed, has 
clandestinely taken possession of our ammunition lodged in the mag- 
azine. We should have attended at Fredericksburg, in order to 
have proceeded to Williamsburg to demand a return of the powder, 
had the alarm reached us before an account of security being given 
for its delivery. However, to assure you arid the world of our readi- 
ness and willingness to resent any encroachment of arbitrary power, 
we now declare to you, should it be necessary, that the first company 
of Independents for Albemarle will attend in Williamsburg, prop- 
erly equipped, and prepared to enforce an immediate delivery of the 
powder (if not to be obtained otherwise), or die in the attempt. 
With respect we remain ready to obey your commands. 

" CHARLES LEWIS, Captain. 

11 GEORGE GILMER, Lieut. 

" JOHN MARKS, 2wc? Lieut. 

" P. S. The company will stand under arms all day on Tuesday 
waiting your answer." 

Three names, signed to the first letter above, were well known in 
the subsequent revolutionary history. Mercer and Weedon were 
generals, and Spotswood a colonel, in the Continental army. The 
first died of wounds received at the battle of Princeton; the two 
last were officeis of approved ability and courage. 

The excitement about the powder gradually subsided, on the 
promise of the Governor to arrange the affair to the satisfaction of 
the people. More than seven hundred men well armed had col- 
lected at Fredericksburg. (Wirt's Life of Patrick Henry, p. 135.) 
A council of deputies from the assembled multitude was held, in 
which, after much warmth of discussion, it was resolved, that they 
should all return home, but be ready to march at a moment's warn- 
ing, on any future alarm. At the close of the following letter is an 
allusion to this meeting. The letter is moreover interesting as an

indication of the public opinion at that time, both in regard to ap- 
proaching events, and to the character and influence of Washington. 

TO COLONEL GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

" Fredericksburg, 30 April, 1775. 
" SIR, 

" It is imagined, that the first thing, which will come on the carpet 
at the meeting of the Congress, will be that of establishing regular 
armies throughout the continent on pay. If such a thing should take 
place, there is not the least doubt, that you will have the command 
of the whole forces in this colony. In that case, I shall ever esteem 
you as my best friend, if you will use your interest in procuring me a 
commission ; or, should the power of choosing officers be vested in 
you, and you should think proper to confer so great an honor on me, 
as qualifying me to be one of your officers, you will find me, as I 
have always been, ready to serve my country gratis in the glorious 
cause of liberty, at the risk of my life and fortune. 

" I am extremely glad to inform you, that, after a long debate, it 
was at last agreed we should not march to Williamsburg. I am with 
respect, &c. 

" ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD." 

Four days after the date of this letter, Washington set out from 
Mount Vernon for the Continental Congress, and as he was chosen 
commander-in-chief of the American forces in June, he never had 
any further immediate connexion with the Independent Companies. 
On his way to Congress he stopped a day in Baltimore (May 6th), 
reviewed the militia companies of that city, and dined at an enter- 
tainment given by the citizens.

after he had engaged to let me have it at twenty. Found Mrs. Wash- 
ington upon my arrival broke out with the measles. 

2<7. Mrs. Barnes, who came to visit Mrs. Washington yesterday, 
returned home in my chariot, the weather being too bad to travel in 
an open carriage ; which, together with Mrs. Washington's indispo- 
sition, confined me to the house, and gave me an opportunity of post- 
ing my books and putting them in good order. 

3f7. Hauled the seine and got some fish, but was near being dis- 
appointed of my boat by means of an oysterman, who had lain at my 
landing, and plagued me a good deal by his disorderly behaviour. 

4th. The weather continued drizzling and warm, and I kept the 
house all day. Mrs. Washington seeming to be very ill, I wrote to 
Mr. Green this afternoon, desiring his company to visit her in the 
morning. 

5th. Mrs. Washington appeared to be something better. Mr. 
Green, however, came to see her about 11 o'clock, and in an hour 
Mrs. Fairfax arrived. Mr. Green prescribed, and just as we were 
going to dinner, Captain Walter Stuart appeared with Dr. Laurie. 
The evening being very cold, and the wind high, Mrs. Fairfax went 
home in the chariot. 

6th. The chariot not returning time enough from Colonel Fair- 
fax's we were prevented from going to church. Mrs. Washington 
was a good deal better to-day ; but the oysterman still continuing his 
disorderly behaviour at my landing, I was obliged in the most per- 
emptory manner to order him and his company away, which he did 
not incline to obey till the next morning. 

7th. Accompanied Mrs. Bassett to Alexandria, and engaged a 
keg of butter of Mr. Kirkpatrick, being quite out of that article. 
Wrote from thence to Dr. Craik to endeavour if possible to engage 
me a gardener from the regiment, and returned in the dusk of the 
evening. 

8th. Directed an indictment to be formed by Mr. Johnston 
against J. B. for a fraud in some iron he sold me. 

\%th. Set out with Mrs. Bassett on her journey to Port Royal. 
The morning was clear and fine, but soon clouded and threatened 
much rain or other falling weather, which is generally the case after 
a remarkable white frost, as it was to-day. We passed Occoquan 
without any great difficulty, notwithstanding the wind was something 
high, and lodged at Mr. McCrae's in Dumfries, sending the horses to 
the tavern. Here I was informed, that Colonel C. was disgusted at 
my house, and left it because he saw an old negro there resembling 
his own image. 



APPENDIX.] EXTRACTS FROM A DIARY. 511 

16th. I parted with Mr. Gisbourne, leaving Colonel Champe's 
before the family was stirring, and about ten o'clock reached my 
mother's, where I breakfasted, and then went to Fredericksburg with 
my brother Samuel, whom I found there. About noon it began 
snowing, the wind at north-west, but not cold. Was disappointed of 
seeing my sister Lewis, and getting a few things, which I wanted out 
of the stores. Returned in the evening to my mother's ; all alone 
with her. 

17th. The snow had turned to rain, and occasioned a sleet, the 
wind at north-east, and the ground covered about an inch and a half 
with snow ; the rain continued with but little intermission till noon, 
and then came on a mist which lasted till night. About noon I set 
out from my mother's, and just at dusk arrived at Dumfries. 

18th. Continued my journey home, the mist continuing till noon, 
when the wind got southerly, and being very warm occasioned a 
great thaw. I however found Potomac River quite covered with ice. 
Dr. Craik at my house. 

%3th. Visited my plantation ; severely reprimanded young Ste- 
phens for his indolence, and his father for suffering it. Found the 
new negro, Cupid, ill of a pleurisy at Dogue Run quarter, and had 
him brought home in a cart for better care of him. 

29^A. White frost, and wind at south till three o'clock, then 
north-west, but not very cold ; clear all day. Cupid was extremely 
ill all this day, and at night when I went to bed I thought him within 
a few hours of breathing his last. 

February 1st. Visited my plantations; found Foster had been 
absent from his charge since the 28th ultimo; left orders for him 
to come immediately to me upon his return; reprehended him 
severely. 

5th. Visited my plantations, and found, to my great surprise, 
Stephens constant at work. Grig and Lucy nothing better. Pass- 
ing by my carpenters, that were hewing, I found that four of them, 
viz. George, Tom, Mike, and young Billy, had only hewed one hun- 
dred and twenty feet yesterday from ten o'clock. Sat down, there- 
fore, and observed Tom and Mike, in a less space than thirty min- 
utes, clear the bushes from about a poplar stock, line it ten feet long, 
and hew each his side twelve inches deep. Then letting them 
proceed their own way, they spent twenty-five minutes more in get- 
ting the cross-cut saw, standing to consider what to do, sawing the 
stock off in two places, putting it on the blocks for hewing it square, 
and lining it. From this time till they had finished the stock en- 
tirely required twenty minutes more, so that in the space of one hour 



512 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

and a quarter, they each of them, from the stump, finished twenty 
feet of hewing ; from hence it appears very clear, that, allowing they 
work only from sun to sun, and require two hours at breakfast, they 
ought to yield each his one hundred and twenty-five feet, while the 
days are at their present length, and more in proportion as they in- 
crease. 

While this was doing, George and Billy sawed thirty feet of plank, 
so that it appears, that making the same allowance as before (but not 
for the time required in piling the stock), they ought to saw one hun- 
dred and eighty feet of plank. It is to be observed, that this hewing 
and sawing likewise were of poplar; what may be the difference, 
therefore, between the working of this wood and other, some future 
observations must make known. 

Wth. Ordered all the men from the different quarters to assem- 
ble at Williamson's quarter in the morning to move Petit's house. 

\\tli. Went out early myself, and continued with my people till 
one o'clock, in which time we got the house about two hundred and 
fifty yards; was informed then that Mr. Digges was at my house, 
upon which I returned finding him and Dr. Laurie there. The 
ground being soft and deep, we found it no easy matter with twenty 
hands, eight horses, and six oxen, to get this house along. Exceed- 
ing clear and fine ; wind northwardly. 

12Z/4. A small frost happening last night to crust the ground, 
caused the hduse to move much lighter, and by nine o'clock it was 
got to the spot on which it was intended to stand. 

l&th. Mr. Clifton came here, and we conditioned for his land ; 
namely, if he is not bound by some prior engagement, I am to have 
all, his land in the Neck (five hundred acres about his house ex- 
cepted), and the land commonly called Brent's, for one thousand six 
hundred pounds currency ; he getting Messrs. Digges to join in 
making me a good and sufficient title. But note, I am not bound to 
ratify this bargain unless Colonel Carlyle will let me have his land 
adjoining Brent's at half a pistole an acre. 

15th. Went to a ball at Alexandria, where music and dancing 
were the chief entertainment ; however, in a convenient room de- 
tached for the purpose abounded great plenty of bread and butter, 
some biscuits, with tea and coffee, which the drinkers of could not 
distinguish from hot water sweetened. Be it remembered, that 
pocket-handkerchiefs served the purposes of table-cloths and napkins, 
and that no apologies were made for either. I shall therefore distin- 
guish this ball by the style and title of the bread and butter ball. 
The proprietors of this ball were Messrs. Carlyle, Laurie, and Robert

Wilson ; but the Doctor, not getting it conducted agreeably to his own 
taste, would claim no share of the merit of it. 

%lst. Visited at Mr. Clifton's, and rode over his lands, but in an 
especial manner viewed that tract called Brent's, which pleased me 
exceedingly at the price he offered it at, viz. half a pistole an acre, 
provided Colonel Carlyle's three hundred acres just below it could be 
annexed at the same price ; and this but a few months ago he offered 
it at, but, now seeming to set a higher value upon it, and at the same 
time putting on an air of indifference, induced me to make Clifton 
another offer for his land, viz. one thousand seven hundred pounds 
currency for all his lands in the Neck, including his own plantation ; 
which offer he readily accepted, upon condition of getting his wife to 
acknowledge her right of dower to it ; and of his success in this he 
was to inform me in a few days. 

22d. Waited on Lord Fairfax at Belvoir, and engaged him to 
dine at Mount Vernon on Monday next. 

26^. Made an absolute agreement with Mr. Clifton for his land (so 
far as depended upon him) on the following terms, to wit, I am to give 
him one thousand one hundred and fifty pounds sterling for his Neck 
lands, containing one thousand eight hundred and six acres, and to 
allow him the use of this plantation he lives on till fall twelve months 
He on his part is to procure the gentlemen of Maryland, to whom his 
lands are under mortgage, to join in a conveyance, and is to put me 
in possession of the land so soon as this can be done ; he is not to 
cut down any timber, nor clear any ground, nor to use more wood, 
than shall be absolutely riecesssary for fences and firing ; neither is 
he to assent to any alterations of tenants, or transferring of leases ; 
but, on the contrary, is to discourage every practice that has a ten- 
dency to lessen the value of the land. N. B. He is also to bring 
Mr. Mercer's opinion concerning the validity of a private sale made 
by himself. Bottled thirty-five dozen of cider ; the weather very 
warm and cloudy with some rain last night. 

29#A. A very great circle round the moon. 

Marched. Mr. Clifton came here to-day, and, under pretence 
of his wife's not consenting to acknowledge her right of dower, 
wanted to disengage himself from the bargain he had made with me 
for his land, on the 26th past. 

6th. Fitted a two-eyed plough, instead of a duck-bill plough, 
and with much difficulty made my chariot wheel-horses plough. 

7th. Put the pole-end horses into the plough in the morning, and 
put in the postilion and hind horse in the afternoon, but the ground 
being well swarded over, and very heavy ploughing, I repented put-

ting them in at all, for fear it should give them a habit of stopping in 
the chariot. 

llth. Visited at Colonel Fairfax's, and was informed that Clif- 
ton had sold his land to Mr. Mason for one thousand two hundred 
pounds sterling, which fully unravelled his conduct on the 2d instant. 

13th. Mulatto Jack returned home with the mares he was sent 
for ; but so poor were they, and so much abused had they been by my 
rascally overseer, that they were scarce able to go, much less to assist 
in the business of the plantations. 

14th. Mr. Carlyle and his wife still remained here. We talked 
a good deal of a scheme of setting up iron-works on Colonel Fairfax's 
land on Shenandoah. Mr. Chapman, who was proposed as a partner, 
being a perfect judge of these matters, was to go up and view the 
conveniences and determine the scheme. 

17th. Went to my mill and took a view of the ruins, which the 
fresh had caused ; determined, however, to repair it with all expedi- 
tion, and accordingly set my carpenters to making wheel and hand 
barrows. 

ISth. Went to the court, partly on my own private business, and 
partly on Clifton's affair ; but, the commissioners not meeting, nothing 
was done in regard to the latter. Much discourse happened between 
him and me concerning his ungenerous treatment of me ; the whole 
turning to little account, it is not worth reciting here ; the result 
of which was, that for fifty pounds more than Mr. Mason offered him, 
he undertook, if possible, to disengage himself from that gentleman, 
and to let me have his land. I did not think myself restrained by 
any rules of honor and conscience from making him this offer, as his 
lands were first engaged to me by the most solemn assurance, that 
any man could give. 

Wth. Peter (my smith) and I, after several efforts to make a 
plough after a new model, partly of my own contriving, were fain to 
give it over, at least for the present. 

26th. Spent the greatest part of the day in making a new plough 
of my own invention. 

April 4th. Apprehending the herrings were come, hauled the 
seine, but caught only a few of them, though a good many of other 
sorts of fish. 

8th. Seven o'clock, a messenger came to inform me, that my mill 
was in great danger of being destroyed. I immediately hurried off all 
hands with shovels, &c. to its assistance, and got there myself just 
time enough to give it a reprieve for this time, by wheeling gravel into 
the place, which the water had washed. While I was there a very

heavy thunder-shower came on, which lasted upwards of an hour. I 
tried what time the mill required to grind a bushel of corn, and to 
my surprise found it was within five minutes of an hour. Old An- 
thony attributed this to the low head of water, but whether it was so 
or not I cannot say. The works are all decayed, and out of order, 
which I rather take to be the cause. This bushel of corn, when 
ground, measured near a peck more of meal. 

May 4:th. Warm and fine ; set out for Frederic to see my ne- 
groes, that lay ill of the smallpox. Took Church in my way to Cole- 
man's, where I arrived about sun-setting. 

5th. - Reached Mr. Stephenson's in Frederic, about four o'clock, 
just time enough to see Richard Mounts interred. Here I was in- 
formed, that Harry and Kit, the two first of my negroes that took the 
smallpox, were dead, and Roger and Phillis, the only two down with 
it, were recovering. Lodged at Mr. Stephenson's. 

7th. After taking the doctor's directions in regard to my people, 
I set out for my quarters and got there about twelve o'clock, time 
enough to go over them and find every thing in the utmost confusion, 
disorder, and backwardness, my overseer lying upon his back with a 
broken leg, and not half a crop especially of corn-ground prepared. 
Engaged Valentine Crawford to go in pursuit of a nurse to be ready 
in case more of my people should be seized with the same disorder. 

8th. Got blankets and every other requisite from Winchester, 
and settled things upon the best footing I could to prevent the small- 
pox from spreading, and, in case of its spreading, for the care of the 
negroes ; Mr. Crawford agreeing, in case any more of the people at 
the lower quarter should take it, to remove them home to his house; 
and if any of those at the upper quarter should get it, to have them 
removed into my room, and the nurse sent for. 

Ytth. Began weeding my trefoil below the hill. Got an account 
that the Assembly was to meet on Monday ; resolved to set out to- 
morrow. 

ISth. Set out in company with Mr. George Johnston ; at Col- 
chester was informed by Colonels Thornton and Chissel, that the 
Assembly would be broken up before I could get down; turned 
back, therefore, and found at my house Colonel Fairfax and his 
family. The lightning, which had been attended with a good deal 
of rain, had struck my quarter, and about ten negroes in it; some 
very badly injured, but with letting blood they recovered.

JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE OHIO RIVER. 

1770. 

October 5th. Began a journey to the Ohio, in company with 
Dr. Craik, his servant, and two of mine, with a led horse and bag- 
gage. Dined at Towlston, and lodged at Leesburg, distant from 
Mount Vernon about forty-five miles. Here my portmanteau horse 
failed. 

6th. Fed our horses on the top of the Ridge, and arrived at my 
brother Samuel's, on Worthington's Marsh, a little after they had 
dined, the distance being about thirty miles; from hence I de- 
spatched a messenger to Colonel Stephen apprising him of my arrival 
and intended journey. 

7th. My portmanteau horse being unable to proceed, I left him 
at my brother's, and got one of his, and proceeded to Samuel Pritch- 
ard's on Cacapehon. Pritchard's is a pretty good house, there 
being fine pasturage, good fences, and beds tolerably clean. 

8th. My servant being unable to travel, I left him at Pritchard's 
with Dr. Craik, and proceeded myself with Valentine Crawford to 
Colonel Cresap's, in order to learn from him (being just arrrived 
from England) the particulars of the grant said to be lately sold to 
Walpole and others, for a certain tract of country on the Ohio. The 
distance from Pritchard's to Cresap's according to computation is 
twenty-six miles. 

9th. Went up to Rumney in order to buy work-horses, and met 
Dr. Craik and my baggage ; arrived there about twelve o'clock. 

Wth. Having purchased two horses, and recovered another 
which had been gone from me near three years, I despatched my 
boy Silas with my two riding-horses home, and proceeded on my 
journey ; arriving at one Wise's (now Turner's) mill about twenty- 
two miles, it being reckoned seven to the place where Cox's Fort for- 
merly stood ; ten to one Parker's ; and five afterwards. 

llth. The morning being wet and heavy we did not set off 
till eleven o'clock, and arrived that night at one Killam's, on a 
branch of George's Creek, distant ten and a half measured miles 
from the north branch of the Potomac, where we crossed at the lower 
end of my deceased brother Augustine's land, known by the name 
of Pendergrass's. This crossing is two miles from the aforesaid mill 




APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 517 

and the road bad, as it likewise is to Killam's, the country being very 
hilly and stony. From Killam's to Fort Cumberland is the same 
distance, that it is to the crossing above mentioned, and the road 
from thence to Jolliff's by the Old Town much better. 

l%th. We left Killam's early in the morning; breakfasted at the 
Little Meadows, ten miles off, and lodged at the Great Crossing 
twenty miles further ; which we found a tolerably good day's work. 
The country we travelled over to-day was very mountainous and 
stony, with but very little good land, and that lying in spots. 

13th. Set out about sunrise ; breakfasted at the Great Meadows 
thirteen miles, and reached Captain Crawford's about five o'clock. 
The land from Gist's to Crawford's is very broken though not moun- 
tainous; in spots exceedingly rich, and in general free from stones. 
Crawford's is very fine land ; lying on the Youghiogany at a place 
commonly called Stewart's Crossing. 

I4tth. At Captain Crawford's all day. Went to see a coal-mine 
not far from his house on the banks of the river. The coal seemed 
to be of the very best kind, burning freely, and abundance of it. 

15M. Went to view some land, which Captain Crawford had 
taken up for me near the Youghiogany, distant about twelve miles. 
This tract, which contains about one thousand six hundred acres, in- 
cludes some as fine land as ever I saw, and a great deal of rich 
meadow. It is well watered, and has a valuable mill-seat, except 
that the stream is rather too slight, and, it is said, not constant more 
than seven or eight months in the year ; but on account of the fall, 
and other conveniences, no place can exceed it. In going to this, 
land, I passed through two other tracts, which Captain Crawford had 
taken up for my brothers Samuel and John. I intended to have vis- 
ited the land, which Crawford had procured for Lund Washington, 
this day also, but, time falling short, I was obliged to postpone it 
Night came on before I got back to Crawford's, where I found Colo- 
nel Stephen. The lands, which I passed over to-day, were generally 
hilly, and the growth chiefly white-oak, but very good notwithstand- 
ing; and what is extraordinary, and contrary to the property of all 
other lands I ever saw before, the hills are the richest land ; the soil 
upon the sides and summits of them being as black as a coal, and the 
growth walnut and cherry. The flats are not so rich, and a good 
deal more mixed with stone. 

16th. At Captain Crawford's till the evening, when I went to 
Mr. John Stephenson's, on my way to Pittsburg and lodged. This 
day I was visited by one Mr. Ennis, who had travelled down the 
Little Kenhawa, almost from the head to the mouth, on which he 

VOL. II. RR 



C 1 O 

518 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

says the lands are broken, the bottoms neither very wide nor rich, 
but covered with beach. At the mouth the lands are good, and con- 
tinue so up the river. About Wheeling, and Fisher's Creek, there 
is, according to his account, a body of fine land. I also saw a son 
of Captain John Harden's, who said he had been from the mouth of 
Little Kenhawa to the Big; but his description of the lands seemed to 
be so vague and indeterminate, that it was much doubted whether he 
ever was there or not. 

17th. Dr. Craik and myself, with Captain Crawford and others, 
arrived at Fort Pitt, distant from the Crossing forty-three and a half 
measured miles. In riding this distance we passed over a great deal 
of exceedingly fine land, chiefly white-oak, especially from Sewickly 
Creek to Turtle Creek, but the whole broken ; resembling, as I 
think all the lands in this country do, the Loudoun lands. We 
lodged in what is called the town, distant about three hundred yards 
from the fort, at one Mr. Semple's, who keeps a very good house of 
public entertainment. The houses, which are built of logs, and 
ranged in streets, are on the Monongahela, and I suppose may be 
about twenty in number, and inhabited by Indian traders. The fort 
is built on the point between the rivers Allegany and Monongahela, 
but not so near the pitch of it as Fort Duquesne stood. It is five- 
sided and regular, two of which near the land are of brick ; the 
others stockade. A moat encompasses it. The garrison consists of 
two companies of Royal Irish, commanded by Captain Edmondson. 

18th. Dined in the Fort with Colonel Croghan and the officers 
of the garrison; supped there also, meeting with great civility from 
the gentlemen, and engaged to dine with Colonel Croghan the next 
day at his seat, about four miles up the Allegany. 

19th. Received a message from .Colonel Croghan, that the 
White Mingo and other chiefs of the Six Nations had something to 
say to me, and desiring that I would be at his house about eleven, 
where they were to meet. I went up and received a speech, with a 
string of wampum from the White Mingo, to the following effect. 

" That as I was a person whom some of them remember to have 
seen, when I was sent on an embassy to the French, and most of 
them had heard of, they were come to bid me welcome to this coun- 
try, and to desire that the people of Virginia would consider them as 
friends and brothers, linked together in one chain ; that I would in- 
form the governor, that it was their wish to live in peace and har- 
mony with the white people, and that though there had been some 
unhappy differences between them and the people upon our frontiers, 
they were all made up, and they hoped forgotten; and concluded

with saying, that their brothers of Virginia did not come among 
them and trade as the inhabitants of the other provinces did, from 
whence they were afraid that we did not look upon them with so 
friendly an eye as they could wish." 

To this I answered, after thanking them for their friendly wel- 
come, " that all the injuries and affronts, that had passed on either 
side, were now totally forgotten, and that I was sure nothing was 
more wished and desired by the people of Virginia, than to live in 
the strictest friendship with them ; that the Virginians were a people 
not so much engaged in trade as the Pennsylvanians, which was the 
reason of their not being so frequently among them ; but that it was 
possible they might for the time to come have stricter connexions 
with them, and that I would acquaint the government with their de- 
sires." 

After dining at Colonel Croghan's we returned to Pittsburg, Colo- 
nel Croghan with us, who intended to accompany us part of the way 
down the river, having engaged an Indian called the Pheasant, and 
one Joseph Nicholson an interpreter, to attend us the whole voyage ; 
also a young Indian warrior. 

20M. We embarked in a large canoe, with sufficient store of 
provision and necessaries, and the following persons, besides Dr. 
Craik and myself, to wit, Captain Crawford, Joseph Nicholson, 
Robert Bell, William Harrison, Charles Morgan, and Daniel Ren- 
don, a boy of Captain Crawford's, and the Indians, who were in a 
canoe by themselves. From Fort Pitt we sent our horses and boys 
back to Captain Crawford's, with orders to meet us there again on 
the 14th day of November. Colonel Croghan, Lieutenant Hamilton, 
and Mr. Magee, set out with us. At two we dined at Mr. Magee's, 
and encamped ten miles below, and four above Logstown. We 
passed several large islands, which appeared to be very good, as the 
bottoms also did on each side of the river alternately ; the hills on 
one side being opposite to the bottoms on the other, which seem gen- 
erally to be about three or four hundred yards wide, and so vice 
versa. 

%lst. Left our encampment about six o'clock, and breakfasted at 
Logstown, where we parted with Colonel Croghan and company 
about nine o'clock. At eleven we came to the mouth of the Big 
Beaver Creek, opposite to which is a good situation for a house, and 
above it, on the same side, that is the west, there appears to be a 
body of fine land. About five miles lower down, on the east side, 
comes in Raccoon Creek, at the mouth of which and up it appears to 
be a body of good land also. All the land between this creek and 



520 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX, 



the Monongahela, and for fifteen miles back, is claimed by Colonel 
Croghan under a purchase from the Indians, which sale he says is 
confirmed by his Majesty. On this creek, where the branches 
thereof interlock with the waters of Shurtees Creek, there is, accord- 
ing to Colonel Croghan' s account, a body of fine, rich, level land. 
This tract he wants to sell, and offers it at five pounds sterling per 
hundred acres, with an exemption of quitrents for twenty years: 
after which, to be subject to the payment of four shillings and two 
pence sterling per hundred acres; provided he can sell it in ten- 
thousand-acre lots. At present the unsettled state of this country 
renders any purchase dangerous. From Raccoon Creek to Little 
Beaver Creek appears to me to be little short of ten miles, and about 
three miles below this we encamped ; after hiding a barrel of biscuit 
in an island to lighten our canoe. 

22 d. As it began to snow about midnight, and continued pretty 
steadily, it was about half after seven before we left our encampment. 
At the distance of about eight miles we came to the mouth of Yellow 
Creek, opposite to, or rather below which, appears to be a long bot- 
tom of very good land, and the ascent to the hills apparently gradual. 
There is another pretty large bottom of very good land about two or 
three miles above this. About eleven or twelve miles from this, and 
just above what is called the Long Island (which though so distin- 
guished is not very remarkable for length, breadth, or goodness), 
comes in on the east side of the river a small creek, or run, the 
name of which I could not learn ; and a mile or two below the isl- 
and, on the west side, comes in Big Stony Creek (not larger in 
appearance than the other), on neither of which does there seem to 
be any large bottoms or bodies of good land. About seven miles from 
the last mentioned creek, twenty-eight from our last encampment, 
and about seventy-five from Pittsburg, we came to the Mingo Town, 
situate on the west side the river, a little above the Cross Creeks. 
This place contains about twenty cabins, and seventy inhabitants 
of the Six Nations. Had we set off early, and kept constantly at it, 
we might have reached lower than this place to-day ; as the water 
in many places ran pretty swift, in general more so than yesterday. 
The river from Fort Pitt to Logstown has some ugly rifts and shoals, 
which we found somewhat difficult to pass, whether from our inexpe- 
rience of the channel, or not, I cannot undertake to say. From 
Logstown to the mouth of Little Beaver Creek is much the same 
kind of water ; that is, rapid in some places, gliding gently along in 
others, and quite still in many. The water from Little Beaver Creek 
to the Mingo Town, in general, is swifter than we found it the pre- 



APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 521 

ceding day, and without any shallows ; there being some one part or 
another always deep, which is a natural consequence, as the river in 
all the distance from Fort Pitt to this town has not widened at all, 
nor do the bottoms appear to be any larger. The hills which come 
close to the river opposite to each bottom are steep ; and on the side 
in view, in many places, rocky and cragged ; but said to abound in 
good land on the tops. These are not a range of hills, but broken 
and cut in two, as if there were frequent watercourses running 
through, which however we did not perceive to be the case. The 
river abounds in wild geese, and several kinds of ducks, but in no 
great quantity. We killed five wild turkeys to-day. Upon our arri- 
val at the Mingo Town, we received the disagreeable news of two 
traders being killed at a town called the Grape-Vine Town, thirty- 
eight miles below this; which caused us to hesitate whether we 
should proceed, or wait for further intelligence. 

23e?. Several imperfect accounts coming in, agreeing that only 
one person was killed, and the Indians not supposing it to be done 
by their people, we resolved to pursue our passage, till we could get 
a more distinct account of this transaction. Accordingly about two 
o'clock we set out with the two Indians, who were to accompany us 
in our canoe, and after about four miles came to the mouth of a creek 
on the east side. The Cross Creeks, as they are called, are not 
large ; that on the west side is biggest. At the Mingo Town we 
found and left more than sixty warriors of the Six Nations, going to 
the Cherokee country to proceed to war against the Catawbas. 
About ten miles below the town, we came to two other cross creeks ; 
that on the west side is the larger, and called by Nicholson, French 
Creek. About three miles, or a little more below this, at the lower 
point of some islands, which stand contiguous to each other, we were 
told by the Indians, that three men from Virginia had marked the 
land from hence all the way to Red-stone ; that there was a body of 
exceedingly fine land lying about this place, and up opposite to the 
Mingo Town, as also down to the mouth of Fishing Creek. At this 
place we encamped. 

24fA. We left our encampment before sunrise, and about six 
miles below it we came to the mouth of a small creek, coming in 
from the eastward, called by the Indians Split-Island Creek, from its 
running in against an island. On this creek there is the appearance 
of good land. Six miles below this again we came to another creek 
on the west side, called by Nicholson, Wheeling ; and about a mile 
lower down appears to be another small water coming in on the east 
side, which I remark, because of the scarcity of them, and to show 
VOL. II. 66 RR * 



522 



WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 



how badly furnished this country is with mill-seats. Two or three 
miles below this is another run on the west side, up which is a near 
way by land to the Mingo Town ; and about four miles lower, comes 
in another on the east, at which place is a path leading to the settle- 
ment at Red-stone. About a mile and a half below this comes in the 
Pipe Creek, so called by the Indians from a stone, which is found 
here, out of which they make pipes. Opposite to this, that is, on the 
east side, is a bottom of exceedingly rich land ; but as it seems to lie 
low, I am apprehensive that it is subject to be overflowed. This bot- 
tom ends where the effects of a hurricane appear, by the destruction 
and havoc among the trees. Two or three miles below the Pipe 
Creek is a pretty large creek on the west side, called by Nicholson, 
Fox-Grape-Vine, by others Captema, Creek, on which, eight miles 
up, is the town called the Grape-Vine Town ; and at the mouth of it 
is the place where it was said the trader was killed. To this place 
we came about three o'clock in the afternoon, and finding nobody 
there, we agreed to encamp, that Nicholson and one of the In- 
dians might go up to the town, and inquire into the truth of the re- 
port concerning the murder. 

25^. About seven o'clock, Nicholson and the Indian returned; 
they found nobody at the town but two old Indian women (the -men 
being a hunting) ; from these they learned that the trader was not 
murdered, but drowned in attempting to cross the Ohio; and that 
only one boy, belonging to the traders, was in these parts ; the trader, 
his father, being gone for horses to take home their skins. About 
half an hour after seven we set out from our encampment ; around 
which and up the creek is a body of fine land. In our passage down 
to this place we saw innumerable quantities of turkeys, and many 
deer watering and browsing on the shore-side, some of which we 
killed. Neither yesterday nor the day before did we pass any rifts, 
or very rapid water, the river gliding gently along ; nor did we per- 
ceive any alteration in the general face of the country, except that 
the bottoms seemed to be getting a little longer and wider, as the 
bends of the river grew larger. 

About five miles from the Vine Creek comes in a very large creek 
to the eastward, called by the Indians Cut Creek, from a town or 
tribe of Indians, which they say was cut off entirely in a very bloody 
battle between them and the Six Nations. This creek empties just 
at the lower end of an island, and is seventy or eighty yards wide ; 
and I fancy it is the creek commonly called Wheeling by the people 
of Red-stone. It extends, according to the Indians' account, a great 
way, and interlocks with the branches of Split-Island Creek; abound-

ing in very fine bottoms, and exceeding good land. Just below this, on 
the west side, comes in a small run ; and about five miles below it, on 
the west side also, another creek empties, called by the Indians 
Broken-Timber Creek ; so named from the timber that is destroyed 
on it by a hurricane ; on the head of this was a town of the Dela- 
wares, which is now deserted. Two miles lower down, on the same 
side, is another creek smaller than the last, and bearing, according 
to the Indians, the same name. Opposite to these two creeks, on 
the east side, appears to be a large bottom of good land. About two 
miles below the last mentioned creek, on the east side, and at the 
end of the bottom aforementioned, comes in a small creek. Seven 
miles from this is Muddy Creek, on the east side of the river, a pretty 
large creek which heads with some of the waters of Monongahela, ac- 
cording to the Indians' account, and is bordered by some bottoms of 
very good land ; but in general the hills are steep, and the country 
broken. At the mouth of this creek is the largest flat I have seen 
upon the river ; the bottom extending two or three miles up the river 
above it, and a mile below ; though it does not seem to be of the 
richest, kind. About half way in the Long Reach we encamped, op- 
posite to the beginning of a large bottom on the east side of the river. 
At this place we threw out some lines at night and found a catfish, 
of the size of our largest river catfish, hooked to one of them in the 
morning, though it was of the smallest kind here. We found no rifts 
in this day's passage, but pretty swift water in some places, and still 
in others. We found the bottoms increased in size, both as to length 
and breadth, and the river more choked up with fallen trees, and the 
bottom of the river next the shores rather more muddy, but in gen- 
eral stony, as it has been all the way down. 

26^7*. Left our encampment at half an hour after six o'clock, and 
passed a small run on the west side about four miles lower. At the 
lower end of the Long Reach, and for some distance up it, on the 
east side, is a large bottom, but low, and covered with beech near 
the river-shore, which is no indication of good land. The Long 
Reach is a straight course of the river for about eighteen or twenty 
miles, which appears the more extraordinary a's the Ohio in general 
is remarkably crooked. There are several islands in this reach, some 
containing an hundred or more acres of land ; but all I apprehend 
liable to be overflowed. 

At the end of this reach we found Martin and Lindsay, two trad- 
ers, and from them learnt, that the person drowned was one Philips, 
attempting, in company with Rogers, another Indian trader, to swim 
the river with their horses at an improper place ; Rogers himself nar-

rowly escaping. Five miles lower down comes in a large creek from 
the east, right against an island of good land, at least a mile or two in 
length. At the mouth of this creek (the name of which I could not 
learn, except that it was called by some Ball's Creek, from one Ball 
that hunted on it) is a bottom of good land, though rather too much 
mixed with beech. Opposite to this island the Indians showed us a 
buffalo's path, the tracks of which we saw. Five or six miles below 
the last mentioned creek we came to the Three Islands. Below 
these islands is a large body of flat land, with a watercourse running 
through it on the east side, and the hills back neither so high nor 
steep in appearance, as they are up the river. On the other hand, 
the bottoms do not appear so rich, though much longer and wider. 
The bottom last mentioned is upon a straight reach of the river, I 
suppose six or eight miles in length. About twelve miles below the 
Three Islands we encamped, just above the mouth of the creek, 
which appears pretty large at the mouth, and just above an island. 
All the lands from a little below the creek, which I have distin- 
guished by the name of Ball's Creek, appear to be level, with some 
small hillocks intermixed, as far as we could see into the country. 
We met with no rifts to-day, but some pretty strong water ; upon the 
whole tolerably gentle. The sides of the river were a good deal in- 
commoded with old trees, which impeded our passage a little. This 
day proved clear and pleasant; the only day since the 18th that it 
has not rained or snowed, or threatened the one or other. 

%7th. Left our encampment a quarter before seven; and after 
passing the creek near which we lay, and another of much the same 
size and on the same side, also an island about two miles in length, 
but not wide, we came to the mouth of Muskingum, distant from our 
encampment about four miles. This river is about one hundred and 
fifty yards wide at the mouth ; it runs out in a gentle current and 
clear stream, and is navigable a great way into the country for 
canoes. From Muskingum to the Little Kenhawa is about thirteen 
miles. This is about as wide at the mouth as the Muskingum, but 
the water much deeper. It runs up towards the inhabitants of Mo- 
nongahela, and, according to the Indians' account, forks about forty 
or fifty miles from the mouth, and the ridge between the two prongs 
leads directly to the settlement. To this fork, and above, the water 
is navigable for canoes. On the upper side of this river there appears 
to be a bottom of exceedingly rich land, and the country from hence 
quite up to the Three Islands level and in appearance fine. The 
Ohio running round it in the form of a horse-shoe forms a neck of 
flat land, which, added to that running up the second Long Reach 





APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 525 

aforementioned, cannot contain less than fifty thousand acres in 
view. 

About six or seven miles below the mouth of the Little Kenhawa, 
we came to a small creek on the west side, which the Indians called 
Little Hockhocking ; but before we did this, we passed another small 
creek on the same side near the mouth of that river, and a cluster of 
islands afterwards. The lands for two or three miles below thb 
mouth of the Little Kenhawa on both sides of the Ohio appear broken 
and indifferent ; but opposite to the Little Hockhocking there is a 
bottom of good land, through which there runs a small watercourse. 
I suppose there may be, of this bottom and flat land together, two or 
three thousand acres. The lower end of this bottom is opposite to a 
small island, of which I dare say little is to be seen when the river is 
high. About eight miles below Little Hockhocking we encamped op- 
posite to the mouth of the Great Hockhocking, which, though so 
called, is not a large water ; though the Indians say canoes can go 
up it forty or fifty miles. Since we left the Little Kenhawa the 
lands appear neither so level nor so good. The bends of the river 
and bottoms are longer, but not so rich as in the upper part of the 
river. 

%8th. Left our encampment about seven o'clock. Two miles 
below, a small run comes in, on the east side, through a piece of 
land that has a very good appearance, the bottom beginning above 
our encampment, and continuing in appearance wide for four miles 
down, where we found Kiashuta and his hunting party encamped. 
Here we were under a necessity of paying our compliments, as this 
person was one of the Six Nation chiefs, and the head of those upon 
this river. In the person of Kiashuta I found an old acquaintance, 
he being one of the Indians that went with me to the French in 
1753. He expressed a satisfaction at seeing me, and treated us with 
great kindness, giving us a quarter of very fine buffalo. He insisted 
upon our spending that night with him, and, in order to retard us as 
little as possible, moved his camp down the river just below the 
mouth of a creek, the name of which I could not learn. At this 
place we all encamped. After much counselling over night, they all 
came to my fire the next morning with great formality ; when Kia- 
shuta, rehearsing what had passed between me and the Sachems at 
Colonel Croghan's, thanked me for saying, that peace and friendship 
with them were the wish of the people of Virginia, and for recom- 
mending it to the traders to deal with them upon a fair and equitable 
footing; and then again expressed their desire of having a trade 
opened with Virginia, and that the governor thereof might not only 



526 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

be made acquainted therewith, but with their friendly disposition to- 
wards the white people. This I promised to do. 

29^. The tedious ceremony, which the Indians observe in their 
counsellings and speeches, detained us till nine o'clock. Opposite 
to the creek, just below which we encamped, is a pretty long bottom, 
and I believe tolerably wide ; but about eight or nine miles below the 
aforementioned creek, and just below a pavement of rocks on the 
west side, comes in a creek, with fallen timber at the mouth, on 
which the Indians say there are wide bottoms and good land. The 
river bottoms above, for some distance, are very good, and continue 
so for near half a mile below the creek. The pavement of rocks is 
only to be seen at low water. About a mile below the mouth of the 
creek there is another pavement of rocks on the east side, in a kind 
of sedgy ground. On this creek are many buffaloes, according to 
the Indians' account. Six miles below this comes in a small creek 
on the west side, at the end of a small, naked island, and just above 
another pavement of rocks. This creek comes through a bottom of 
fine land, and opposite to it, on the east side of the river, appears to 
be a large bottom of very fine land also. At this place begins what 
they call the Great Bend. Two miles below, on the east side, comes 
in another creek, just below an island, on the upper point of which 
are some dead standing trees, and a parcel of white-bodied syca- 
mores ; in the mouth of this creek lies a sycamore blown down by 
the wind. From hence an east line may be run three or four miles; 
thence a north line till it strikes the river, which I apprehend would 
include about three or four thousand acres of valuable land. At the 
mouth of this creek is the warriors' path to the Cherokee country. 
For two miles and a half below this the Ohio runs a north-east course, 
and finishes what they call the Great Bend. Two miles and a half 
below this we encamped. 

30/j. We set out about fifty minutes past seven, the weather be- 
ing windy and cloudy, after a night of rain. After about two miles we 
came to the head of a bottom, in the shape of a horse-shoe, which I 
judge to be about six miles round ; the beginning of the bottom ap- 
peared to be very good land, but the lower part did not seem so 
friendly. The upper part of the bottom we encamped on was ex- 
ceeding good, but the lower part rather thin land, covered with beech. 
In it is some clear meadow-land, and a pond or lake. This bottom 
begins just below the rapid at the point of the Great Bend. The 
river from this place narrows very considerably, and for five or six 
miles is scarcely more than one hundred and fifty or two hundred 
yards over. The water yesterday, except the rapid at the Great 




APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 527 

Bend, and some swift places about the islands, was quite dead, and 
as easily passed one way as the other ; the land in general appeared 
level and good. 

About ten miles below our encampment, and a little lower down 
than the bottom described to lie in the shape of a horse-shoe, comes 
in a small creek on the west side, and opposite to this on the east be- 
gins a body of flat land, which the Indians tell us runs quite across 
the fork to the falls in the Kenhawa, and must at least be three 
days' walk across ; if so, the flat land contained therein must be very 
considerable. A mile or two below this we landed, and after getting 
a little distance from the river, we came, without any rising, to a 
pretty lively kind of land grown up with hickory and oaks of different 
kinds, intermixed with walnut. We also found many shallow ponds, 
the sides of which, abounding with grass, invited innumerable quanti- 
ties of wild fowl, among which I saw a couple of birds in size be- 
tween a swan and a goose, and in color somewhat between the two, 
being darker than the young swan and of a more sooty color. The 
cry of these birds was as unusual as the birds themselves ; I never 
heard any noise resembling it before. About five miles below this 
we encamped in a bottom of good land, which holds tolerably flat and 
rich for some distance out. 

31st. I sent the canoe down about five miles to the junction of 
the two rivers, that is, the Kenhawa with the Ohio, and set out upon 
a hunting party to view the land. We steered nearly east for about 
eight or nine miles, then bore southwardly and westwardly, till we 
came to our camp at the confluence of the rivers. The land from 
the rivers appeared but indifferent, and very broken ; whether these 
ridges may not be those that divide the waters of the Ohio from the 
Kenhawa is not certain, but I believe they are ; if so, the lands may 
yet be good; if not, that which lies beyond the river bottoms is 
worth little. 

November 1st. Before eight o'clock we set off with our canoe up 
the river, to discover what kind of lands lay upon the Kenhawa. The 
land on both sides this river just at the mouth is very fine ; but on 
the east side, when you get towards the hills, which I judge to be 
about six or seven hundred yards from the river, it appears to be wet, 
and better adapted for meadow than tillage. This bottom continues 
up the east side for about two miles ; and by going up the Ohio a 
good tract might be got of bottom land, including the old Shawnee 
Town, which is about three miles up the Ohio, just above the mouth 
of a creek. We judged we went up the Kenhawa about ten miles 
to-day. On the east side appear to be some good bottoms, but small, 



528 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

neither long nor wide, and the hills back of them rather steep and 
poor. 

2c?. We proceeded up the river with the canoe about four miles 
farther, and then encamped, and went a hunting ; killed five buffaloes 
and wounded some others, three deer, &c. This country abounds 
in buffaloes and wild game of all kinds ; as also in all kinds of wild 
fowl, there being in the bottoms a great many small, grassy ponds, or 
lakes, which are full of swans, geese, and ducks of different kinds. 
Some of our people went up the river four or five miles higher, and 
found the same kind of bottom on the west side ; and we were told by 
the Indians, that it continued to the falls, which they judged to be 
fifty or sixty miles higher up. This bottom next the water in most 
places is very rich ; as you approach to the hills you come to a thin 
white-oak land and poor. The hills as far as we could judge were 
from half a mile to a mile from the river, poor and steep in the parts 
we saw, with pine growing on them. Whether they are generally 
so or not we cannot tell, but I fear they are. 

3rf. We set off down the river, on our return homewards, and 
encamped at the mouth. At the beginning of the bottom above the 
junction of the rivers, and at the mouth of a branch on the east side, 
I marked two maples, an elm, and hoop-wood tree, as a corner of the 
soldiers' land (if we can get it), intending to take all the bottom 
from hence to the rapids in the Great Bend into one survey. I also 
marked at the mouth of another run lower down on the west side, at 
the lower end of the long bottom, an ash and hoop- wood for the be- 
ginning of another of the soldiers' surveys, to extend up so as to in- 
clude all the bottom in a body on the west side. In coming from 
our last encampment up the Kenhawa, I endeavoured to take the 
courses and distances of the river by a pocket compass, and by 
guessing. 

4#/. After passing these hills, which may run on the river near 
a mile, there appears to be another pretty good bottom on the east 
side. At this place we met a canoe going to the Illinois with sheep ; 
and at this place also, that is, at the end of the bottom from the Ken- 
hawa, just as we came to the hills, we met with a sycamore about 
sixty yards from the river of a most extraordinary size, it measuring, 
three feet from the ground, forty-five feet round, lacking two inches ; 
and not fifty yards from it was another, thirty-one feet round. After 
passing this bottom, and about a mile of hills, we entered another 
bottom and encamped. This bottom reaches within about half a 
mile of the rapid at the point of the Great Bend. 

5th. I sent off the canoe with our baggage, and walked across 



APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 529 

the neck on foot, with Captain Crawford, the distance, according to 
our walking, about eight miles, as we kept a straight course under 
the foot of the hills, which run about south-east and were two hours 
und a half in walking it. This is a good neck of land, the soil being 
generally good, and in places very rich. There is a large proportion 
of meadow ground, and the land as high, dry, and level as one could 
wish ; the growth in most places beech intermixed with walnut, but 
more especially with poplar, of which there are numbers very large. 
The land towards the upper end is black-oak, and very good. Upon 
the whole, a valuable tract might be had here, and I judge the quan- 
tity to be about four thousand acres. After passing this bottom and 
the rapid, as also some hills, which jut pretty close to the river, we 
came to that bottom before remarked the 29th ultimo. A little 
above this bottom we encamped, the afternoon being rainy, and 
night wet. 

6th We left our encampment a little after daylight, and after 
about five miles we came to Kiashuta's hunting camp, which was now 
removed to the mouth of that creek, noted October 29th for having 
fallen timber at the mouth of it, in a bottom of good land. By the 
kindness and idle ceremony of the Indians, I was detained at Kia- 
shuta's camp all the remaining part of this day ; and having a good 
deal of conversation with him on the subject of land, he informed 
me, that it was further from the mouth of the Great Kenhawa to the 
fall of that river, than it was between the two Kenhawas ; that the 
bottom on the west side, which begins near the mouth of the Ken- 
hawa, continues all the way to the falls without the interposition of 
hills, and widens as it goes, especially from a pretty large creek that 
comes in about ten or fifteen miles higher up than where we were ; 
that in the fork there is a body of good land, and at a considerable 
distance above this, the river forks again at an island, and there be- 
gins the reed, or cane, to grow ; that the bottoms on the east side of 
the river are also very good, but broken with hills, and that the river 
is easily passed with canoes to the falls, which cannot be less than 
one hundred miles, but further it is not possible to go with them ; 
that there is but one ridge from thence to the settlements upon 
the river above, on which it is possible for a man to travel, the 
country between being so much broken with steep hills and pre- 
cipices. * 

* For the succeeding ten days the manuscript journal has been so much in- 
jured by accident, that it is impossible to transcribe it The route, however 
continued up the Ohio River, which was very much swollen by the rains.

530 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX 

17 'th. By this morning the river had fallen in the whole twenty- 
two or twenty-three feet, and was still lowering. About eight o'clock 
we set out, and passing the lower Cross Creeks we came to a pretty 
long and tolerably wide and good bottom on the east side of the river ; 
then came in the hills, just above which is Buffalo Creek. About 
three o'clock we came to the Mingo Town without seeing our horses, 
the Indian, who was sent express for them, having passed through 
only the morning before ; being detained by the creeks, which were 
too high to ford. 

Here we resolved to wait their arrival, which was expected to- 
morrow ; and here then will end our water voyage along a river, the 
general course of which from Beaver Creek to the Kenhawa is about 
south-west, as near as I could determine ; but, in its windings through 
a narrow vale, extremely serpentine ; forming on both sides of the 
river alternately necks of very good bottoms, some exceedingly fine, 
lying for the most part in the shape of a half-moon, and of various 
sizes. There is very little difference in the general width of the river 
from Fort Pitt to the Kenhawa ; but in the depth I believe the odds 
are considerably in favor of the lower parts, as we found no shallows 
below the Mingo Town, except in one or two places where the river 
was broad, and there, I do not know but there might have been a 
deep channel in some parts of it. Every here and there are islands, 
some larger and some smaller, which, operating in the nature of 
locks, or steps, occasion pretty still water above, but for the most 
part strong and rapid water alongside of them. However none of 
these is so swift but that a vessel may be rowed or set up with poles. 
When the river is in its natural state, large canoes, that will carry 
five or six thousand weight or more, may be worked against the 
stream by four hands, twenty or twenty-five miles a day ; and down, 
a good deal more. The Indians, who are very dexterous (even their 
women) in the management of canoes, have their hunting-camps and 
cabins all along the river, for the convenience of transporting their 
skins by water to market. In the fall, so soon as the hunting-season 
comes on, they set out with their families for this purpose ; and in 
hunting will move their camps from place to place, till by the spring 
they get two or three hundred or more miles from their towns ; then 
catch beaver in their way up, which frequently brings them into the 
month of May, when the women are employed in planting. The 
men are at market, and in idleness, till the autumn again, when they 
pursue the same course. During the summer months they live a 
poor and perishing life. 

The Indians who reside upon the Ohio, the upper parts of it at 



APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 531 

least, are composed of Shawanees, Delawares, and some of the Min- 
goes, who, getting but little part of the consideration that was given 
for the lands eastward of the Ohio, view the settlements of the people 
upon this river with an uneasy and jealous eye, and do not scruple 
to say, that they must be compensated for their right if the people 
settle thereon, notwithstanding the cession of the Six Nations. On 
the other hand, the people of Virginia and elsewhere are exploring 
and marking all the lands that are valuable, not only on the Red- 
stone and other waters of the Monongahela, but along the Ohio as 
low as the Little Kenhawa ; and by next summer I suppose they will 
get to the Great Kenhawa at least. How difficult it may be to con- 
tend with these people afterwards is easy to be judged, from every 
day's experience of lands actually settled, supposing these settlements 
to be made ; than which nothing is more probable, if the Indians per- 
mit them, from the disposition of the people at present. A few set- 
tlements in the midst of some of the large bottoms would render it 
impracticable to get any large quantity of land together ; as the hills 
all the way down the river, as low as I went, come pretty close, are 
steep and broken, and incapable of settlements (though some of them 
are rich), and only fit to support the bottoms with timber and wood. 
The land back of the bottoms, as far as I have been able to judge, 
either from my own observations or from information, is nearly the 
same, that is, exceedingly uneven and hilly ; and I presume there are 
no bodies of flat, rich land to be found, till one gets far enough from 
the river to head the little runs and drains, that come through the 
hills, and to the sources of the creeks and their branches. This, it 
seems, is the case with the lands upon the Monongahela and Yough- 
iogany, and I fancy holds good upon this river, till you get into the 
flat lands below the falls. The bottom land differs a good deal in 
quality. That highest up the river in general is richest ; though the 
bottoms are neither so wide nor so long, as those below. Walnut, 
cherry, and some other kinds of wood neither tall nor large, but cov- 
ered with grape vines, with the fruit of which this country at this in- 
stant abounds, are the growth of the richest bottoms ; but on the other 
hand, these bottoms appear to me to be the lowest and most subject 
to floods. The sugar-tree and ash, mixed with walnut, compose the 
growth of the next richest low grounds ; beech, poplar, and oaks the 
last. The soil of this is also good, but inferior to either of the other 
kinds ; and beech bottoms are objectionable on account of the diffi- 
culty of clearing them, as their roots spread over a large surface of 
ground and are hard to kill. 

18/A. Agreed with two Delaware Indians to take up our canoe 



532 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [APPENDIX. 

to Fort Pitt, for the doing of which I was to pay six dollars and give 
them a quart tin can. 

19th. The Delawares set off with the canoe, and, our horses nc 
arriving, the day appeared exceedingly long and tedious. Upon 
conversing with Nicholson, I found he had been two or three times 
to Fort Chartres, on the Illinois, and I got from him an account of 
the lands between this place and that, and upon the Shawnee River, 
on which he had been a hunting. 

20^. About one o'clock our horses arrived, having been pre- 
vented from getting to Fort Pitt by the freshes. At two we set out 
and got about ten miles, the Indians travelling along with us. 

%lst. Reached Fort Pitt in the afternoon, distant from our last 
encampment about twenty-five miles, and, as near as I can guess, 
thirty-five from the Mingo Town. The land between the Mingo 
Town and Pittsburg is of different kinds. For four or five miles 
after leaving the first mentioned place we passed over steep, hilly 
ground covered with white-oak, and a thin shallow soil. This was 
succeeded by a lively white-oak land, less broken ; and this again 
by rich land, the growth of which was chiefly white and red-oak 
mixed ; which lasted, with some intervals of indifferent ridges, all the 
way to Pittsburg. It was very observable, that, as we left the river, 
the land grew better, which is a confirmation of the accounts I had 
before received, that the good bodies of land lie upon the heads of 
the runs and creeks ; but in all my travels through this country, I 
have seen no large body of level land. On the branches of Raccoon 
Creek there appears to be good meadow ground, and on Shurtees 
Creek, over both of which we passed, the land looks well. The 
country between the Mingo Town and Fort Pitt appears to be well 
supplied with springs. 

22c?. Stayed at Pittsburg all day. Invited the officers and some 
other gentlemen to dinner with me at Semple's, among whom was 
one Dr. Connolly, nephew to Colonel Croghan, a very sensible, intel- 
ligent man, who had travelled over a good deal of this western coun- 
try both by land and water, and who confirms Nicholson's account of 
the good land on the Shawnee River, up which he had been near 
four hundred miles. This country (I mean on the Shawnee River), 
according to Dr. Connolly's description, must be exceedingly desir- 
able on many accounts. The climate is fine, the soil remarkably 
good ; the lands well watered with good streams, and level enough 
for any kind of cultivation. Besides these advantages from nature, 
it has others not less important to a new settlement, particularly 
game, which is so plentiful as to render the transportation of pro- 



APPENDIX.] TOUR TO THE OHIO. 533 

visions thither, bread only excepted, altogether unnecessary. Dr. 
Connolly is so much delighted with the lands and climate on that 
river, that he wishes for nothing more, than to induce one hundred 
families to go there and live, that he might be among them. A new 
and most desirable government might be established there, to be 
bounded, according to his account, by the Ohio northward and west- 
ward, by the ridge that divides the waters of the Tennessee or Chero- 
kee River southward and westward, and a line to be run from the 
Falls of the Ohio, or above, so as to cross the Shawnee River above 
the fork of it. Dr. Connolly gives much the same account of the 
land between Fort Chartres in the Illinois country, and Post St. 
Vincent, that Nicholson does, except in the article of water, which 
the Doctor says is bad, and in the summer scarce, there being little 
else than stagnant water to be met with. 

23d. After settling with the Indians and people that attended 
me down the river, and defraying the sundry expenses accruing at 
Pittsburg, I set off on my return home; and, after dining at the 
widow Miers's, on Turtle Creek, reached Mr. John Stephenson's in 
the night. 

24<7i. When we came to Stewart's Crossing at Crawford's, the 
river was too high to ford, and his canoe gone adrift. However, 
after waiting there two or three hours, a canoe was got, in which we 
passed, and swam our horses. The remainder of this day I spent at 
Captain Crawford's, it either raining or snowing hard all day. 

25th. I set out early in order to see Lund Washington's land ; 
but the ground and trees being covered with snow, I was able to 
form but an indistinct opinion of it ; though, upon the whole, it ap- 
peared to be a good tract of land. From this I went to Mr. Thomas 
Gist's and dined, and then proceeded on to the Great Crossing at 
Hogland's, where I arrived about eight o'clock. 

26^/j. Reached Killam's, on George's Creek, where we met 
several families going over the mountains to live ; some without hav- 
ing any places provided. The snow upon the Allegany Mountains 
was near knee deep. 

27M. We got to Colonel Cresap's at the Old Town, after calling 
at Fort Cumberland and breakfasting with one Mr. Innis at the 
new store opposite. 

2SM. The Old Town Creek was so high as to wet us in cross- 
ing it, and when we came to Cox's the river was impassable ; we 
were obliged therefore to cross in a canoe, and swim our horses. 
At Henry Enoch's, at the Forks of Cacapehon, we dined, and lodged 
at Rinker's

. Set out early, and reached my brother's by one o'clock. 
Dr. Craik, having business at Winchester, went that way, and was to 
meet me at Snickers's the next norning by ten o'clock. 

30th. According to appointment the Doctor and I met, and after 
breakfasting at Snickers's we proceeded to West's, where we ariived 
at or about sunset. 

December 1st. Reached home, having been absent nine weeks 
and one day.
