TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Now Windsor, 8 April, 1781. 

Sir, 

The enclosed return, made up to the first of the 
month, will show the number of recruits, who have 
joined this post of the Continental army since its formation upon the new establishment. My requests to the 
executives of the several States have been earnest, 
and my orders to the officers in them have been pointed and positive, to send forward the recruits as fast 
as possible. What to expect, or rather to apprehend, 
from these delays. Congress can more easily conceive 
than I can describe. Some States, I am told, despairing of getting their quotas for the war, or three years, 
are resorting to the old expedient of temporary enlistments, while impediments of another kind withhold 
the recruits from the army in others. 

The bare relation of these facts, without combining 
other circumstances of equal magnitude and uncertainty, or adding to them the difficulties with which we are surrounded for want of money, will convince Congress of the impracticability of my fixing at this time 
on any definitive plan of a campaign, and of my inability to carry into effect those, which have heretofore 
been the objects of contemplation. They will readily 
see, that our future operations depend upon contingencies, and that our determinations must be the result of the moment, and dependent upon circumstances. 
In this view of matters here, the progress of the enemy under Lord Cornwallis, and in consideration of 
the reinforcement which has lately gone to him, I have 
judged it expedient to order the Marquis de Lafayette 
to proceed with his detachment to the southern army, 
and put himself under the orders of Major-General Greene. The greatest objection I had to the measure, 
circumstanced as things now are, was, that the detachment was not formed for the campaign, or for so distant a service as that on which they are now ordered ; 
consequently neither officers nor men were prepared 
for it ; but the urgent call for succour to the southern 
States, the proximity of this corps to them, die expedition with which it can join the southern army, and 
the public expense that will be saved by its advance, 
have overcome all less considerations in deciding upon it. I wish the march of the Pennsylvania troops 
could be facilitated, and that Moylan's cavalry could 
be recruited, equipped, and marched without delay ; 
for every judicious officer I have conversed with from 
the southward, and all the representations I received 
thence, confirm me in the opinion, that great advantages are to be derived from a superior cavalry. Without magazines, and with an interrupted communication, I do not see how Lord Cornwallis could have 
subsisted his army, if we had outnumbered him in 
horse. 

I think it my duty to inform Congress, that there is great dissatisfaction at this lime in the Acw Vorii line 
lor want of pay. Near sixteen months' pay, I am tokl, 
is due. If it were practicable to give this and the 
Jersey troops, if they are in the same predicament, a 
small portion of their pay, it might stop desertion, 
which is frequent, and avert greater evils, which are 
otherwise to be apprehended. The four eastern States 
have given a temporary relief to their troops, which 
makes the case of others, those of New York particularly, appear more distressing and grievous to them. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New Windor, 1(5 April, 1781. 

Sir 

Previous to the receipt of your letter, I had directed the commissary of prisoners to renew a proposal, which was some time since made to the enemy, 
for exchanging General Burgoyne, and a balance of 
private prisoners due to us, for the residue of our officers on Long Island, and as many of the southern 
officers as would make up the difference. My motives 
for this proposal were these. General Burgoyne is 
said to be in ill health ; his death would deprive us in 
exchanges of the value of one thousand and forty private men, or officers equivalent, according to the tariff 
which has been settled. I thought it advisable not to risk so considerable a loss, when his exchange would 
give relief to a number of our officers in captivity, and 
disembarrass the public of the inconvenience of maintaining them there. 

The moment I received your letter, I wrote to Mr. Skinner, countermanding his instructions. I believe 
the countermand will arrive before he has done any 
thing in the matter ; but if it does not, I am persuaded 
the enemy will again reject the proposal. As soon as 
I hear from him, if things are situated as I expect, I 
will execute immediately the order for the recall of 
General Burgoyne. To the best of my recollection, 
all the officers in Europe on parole have been exchanged. I have the honor to be, &lc.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CO.VGRKSS. 

New Windsor, 17 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

The Count de Rochambeau having received despatches from the court of France by his son, the 
Viscount de Rochambeau, who arrived at Boston in 
the frigate Concorde, on the 6th instant, has requested 
an interview with me. I have appointed the place of meeting at Weathersfield, on Monday next, for which 
purpose I shall set out hence to-morrow. I am in 
hopes, that we shall be able, from the intelligence received, to settle a definitive plan of the campaign. 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that a pai-t of 
our advanced troops were surprised on Monday morning near Croton River, by about sixty horse and two 
hundred foot under the command of Colonel Delancey. 
Colonel Greene, who commanded our party, was mortally wounded in his quarters. The enemy attempted 
to cai-ry him off, but he died upon the road. Major Flagg was killed. The loss of these two officers is to 
be regretted, especially the former, who had upon several occasions distinguished himself, particularly in the 
defence of the post of Red Bank, in 1777, when he 
defeated Count Donop. I enclose a return of our loss 
upon the late occasion. 

The enemy on their return fell in with Captain Flagg 
of the New Hampshire line, who was patrolling near 
White Plains. They attempted to surround him, and cut liim otr by dint of superior numbers ; but the captain made so good a disposition of his small force, that 
he brought them off with the loss of two men only. 
The enemy had a ca[)tain antl several men killed in 
the attack. I have llic honor to be, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New Windsor, 27 May, 1781. 

Sir, 
I do myself the honor to inform Congress, that I returned from Weathersfield on the evening of the 25th. 

I met only the Count de Rochambeau at that place, 
accompanied by the Chevalier de Chastellux. The 
British fleet having appeared off Block Island, the 
Count de Barras did not think it prudent to be absent. In consequence of the measures concerted at the late interview, all the French troops, except about 
two hundred to be left as a guard over their heavy stores and baggage at Providence, are to march as 
soon as circumstances will admit, and form a junction with me upon the North River. Five lumdred militia are to be stationed upon Rliotic I>laMd for the preservation of the works, whicli have been erected for 
the security of the harbour. 

Upon a lull consideration of affairs in every point of 
view, an operation against New York has been deemed 
preferable to making further detachments to the southward, while they can only be sent by land. The principal reasons, which induced to this determination, are, 
the difficulty and expense of transportation, the lateness of the season, which would throw the troops into 
the extremity of the heat of sunmier ; the great waste 
of men, which we have ever experienced in so long a 
march at the healthiest season ; and, above all, a strong 
presumption, that the enemy, weakened as they now 
are by detachments, must cither sacrifice the valuable 
post of New York and its dependencies, or recall a 
part of their force from the southward to defend them. 

The Continental battalions, from New Hampshire to 
New Jersey inclusive, supposing them complete, aided 
by four thousand French troops, and such a reinforcement of militia as the operation alter its commencement 
may seem to require, have been deemed adequate to 
the attempt upon New York with its present garrison. 
But, as the battalions of those States are still considerably deficient, I have written in the most pressing 
manner to the respective legislatures, to make up such 
deficiencies with men for the campaign only, if they 
cannot be obtained for a longer term, and have desired 
the governors to hold certain numbers of militia ready 
for service, should I have occasion to call for them. I 
am however determined to require no more, than are 
absolutely necessar}. I shall also call on the State of 
Pennsylvania to hold sixteen hundred militia in readiness. 

Congress have been made so fully acquainted with 
the difficulties of every kind, under which the military 
department labors, that they must be sensible nothing 
but the most vigorous exertions on the part of the 
States to supply men, provisions, and the means of 
transportation, can enable me to prosecute to eflect the 
operations, which I have agreed, in conjunction with 
the army of our allies, to undertake, or indeed any 
other. At the dme I made my requisitions upon them, 
I advanced every argument in my power to induce a 
compliance ; but, should I find any hesitation, I shall 
hope for the countenance and support of Congress. 

I am very apprehensive of a formidable invasion of 
the northern frontier, as the enemy from Canada are 
midoubtedly collecting in considerable force at Crown 
Point. Should this be the case, it will cause a very 
unfortunate diversion, and be very embarrassing just at 
this time, when our whole force will be required here. 
The necessity, which I clearly foresee we shall be under, of taking every man, who can be spared from other duties, into the field, induces me to request an order for such men of the invahd corps at Boston and 
Philadelphia, as are fit for garrison duty, to march to 
West Point, where their services will be the same as 
those upon which they are now employed, and where 
they may be very useful. 

There has been a necessity of abandoning the post 
of Fort Schuyler, and removing the garrison and stores 
to the German Flats. The barracks had been, at the 
beginning of this month, consumed by fire, and the 
works so exceedingly damaged by a heavy storm of 
rain, that they were rendered indefensible ; nor could 
they be repaired in any reasonable time by the number of men, who coukl he spared as a garrison. BrigadierGeneral Clinton recommended the evacuation of the 
post, as the only alternative, to which I the more readily consented, as it had been for some time past the 
opinion of the officers best acquainted with that part 
of the country, that a post at the German Flats would 
be more easily sujiported, and equally advantageous to 
the security of the Ironlier. I am, 6cc.

TO Tin: l'l!i;SIUKNT OF CONGRKSS. 

New Windsor, Juno, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have written to the Board of War, on the subject of the removal of the convention troops, and have given it as my opinion, with my reasons, that they had best 
for the present be hahed in Pennsylvania. An exchange of those troops, on proper terms, would certainly be a desirable thing ; but under present circumstances I do not think it would be advisable to give the 
enemy any reinforcement of privates. Every man they 
get adds immediately to their force. Many of those, 
whom we obtain in exchange, are out of then- term of 
service, and consequently lost to us. 

It is as much my wish, as it can be your Excellency's, that General Gates's affair should be brought to 
a decision. You must be convinced, that nothing has 
been left undone by me to effect that purpose. General Gates informs me, that he cannot think of serving, 
until the matter shall have been properly investigated, 
and that he shall retire in the mean time to Virginia. 
I see no probal)ility of any thing further being done 
until there shall be some recess in southern operations. 

I hope the rules of promotion, which Congress have 
been pleased to establish, will be generally satisfactory. 
Individuals may be affected by the change of mode, 
but it will be impossible to devise a plan, which will 
not interfere in some degree with particulai- interests. 
I send your Excellency by this conveyance duplicates 
of my letters, the originals of which were taken in the 
last week's mail. The communication by the post from 
hence to Philadelphia has become so dangerous, that I 
cannot in future trust any despatches of importance by 
him, and I beg you will observe the same rule. The 
parties sent out know the exact time at which he may 
be expected, and cannot fail of securing him. They 
have not the same opportunity of intercepting expresses, as their times of riding are uncertain. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

iIcad-Q,uarters, near Dobbs's Ferry, 6 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency, 
that the army marched from their camp near Peekskill 
on the morning of the 2d, without either tents or baggage, and reached Valentine's Hill, about four miles on 
this side of Kingsbridge, a little alter dayliglit the 
morning following. 

General Lincoln, with a detachment of eight hundred 
men, fell down the North River in boats, landed near 
Pliillips's House before daylight on the morning of the 
3d, and took possession of the ground on this side of 
Haerlerp River, near where Fort Independence stood. 
This movement was principally intended to support and 
favor an enterprise, which I had projected against a 
corps of refugees under the command of Colonel Delancey at Morrisania, and other light troops without the 
bridge, and which was to have been executed by the 
Duke de Lauzun with his own legion, Colonel Sheldon's regiment, and a detachment of State troops of 
Connecticut under the command of Brigadier-General Waterbury. The Duke, notwithstanding the heat of 
the day of the 2d, marched from Ridgebury, in Connecticut, and reached East Chester very early next 
morning; but, upon his arrival there, finding by the 
firing that General Lincoln had been attacked, and the 
alarm given, he desisted from a frirther prosecution of 
his plan (which could only have been executed to any 
effect by surprise), and marched to the General's support, who continued skirmishing with the enemy and 
endeavouring to draw them so far into the country, that 
the Duke might turn their right and cut them off from 
their work on the east side of Haerlem River, and also 
prevent their repassing that river in boats. General Parsons had possessed the heights immediately commanding Kingsbridge, and could have prevented their 
escape by that passage. Every endeavour of this kind 
proved fruitless ; for I found, upon going down myself 
to reconnoitre their situation, that all their force, except 
very small parties of observation, had retired to York 
Island. This afforded General Duportail and myself 
the most favorable opportunity of perfectly reconnoitring the works upon the north end of the Island, and 
making observations, which may be of very great advantage in future. Finding nothing further could be 
done, I returned the day before yesterday to this 
ground, where I expect to be joined this day by his 
Excellency the Count de Rochambeau, who reached 
North Castle on the 2d instant. 

I cannot too warmly express the obligations I am under to the Count, for the readiness with which he detached the Duke de Lauzun, and for the rapidity with 
which he pushed the march of his main body, that he 
might have been within supporting distance, had any favorable stroke upon the enemy below given us an opportunity of pursuing any advantage, which might have 
been gained. General Lincoln had five or six men 
killed and about thirty wounded in his skirmish. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Head-Quarters, 21 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

The army will make a movement this evening. You will march your corps on the same route, anil in such 
time and manner as to be at East Chester between daybreak and sunrise. Your troops should be supplied, 
if possible, with three days' cooked provisions ; and the movements of the army, as well as of your troops, 
must be kept a secret until the moment you march. 

In order to prevent the enemy from obtaining any 
intelligence whatever from us, I have ordered small 
parties to waylay all the roads from the North River 
to East Chester. I must request that you will send an 
active subaltern and twenty men with good guides early 
this afternoon across the fields and woods from your 
encampment to some good position for an ambuscade, 
on the side of the road leading from New Rochelle to 
East Chcstor, as near the latter as may be without 
liazard of iliscovery. This jiarty imisl remain perfectly 
concealed, with orders to appreiiend all persons going 
towards Kingsbridge. It is essential that your party 
should not be seen by the inhabitants, as this might 
frustrate the very object of our operations. You will 
be convinced. Sir, by your own experience and good 
sense, that the profoundest secrecy is absolutely necessary in all military matters, and in no instance more 
indispensably so, than in movements towards the enemy's lines. After you have given all the necessary 
orders, I could wish you would come to head-quarters 
and dine with me, as I may have many things to communicate personally to you. I am, &.c.

TO THOMAS MCKEAN, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 21 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored by the receipt of your letter of 
the 14th and 17th of this month, with the several resolutions of Congress, and the extracts from intercepted 
letters enclosed. I am obliged by your attention in the 
communication of the extracts, although I had been 
favored with them through another channel, previous 
to the receipt of yours. The intelligence to be collected from them, if properly improved, I think may 
turn greatly to our advantage.

I take this opportunity most sincerely to congratulate 
you, Sir, on the honor conferred on you by Congress, 
in being elected to preside in that most respectable 
body. Happy, as I expect to be in your correspondence, I dare say I shall have no reason to complain 
of the mode of your conducting it, as from a knowledge of your character I flatter myself it will ever be 
performed with great propriety. I take _ the liberty, 
however, to request as a particular favor, that you will 
be so good as to convey to me, as you have opportunity, any interesting intelligence, which you may receive either from Europe, or respecting our Continental affairs. Your situation will put it particularly in your 
power to oblige nie in tliis respect, and be assured, 
Sir, that a greater obligation cannot be conferred ; 
since, for want of communication in this way, I have 
often been left in tht- dark in matters, which essentially concern the public welfare, and which, if known, 
might be very inlluential in the government of my 
conduct in the militaiy line. 

I am very happy to be informed, by accounts from 
all parts of the continent, of the agreeable prospect 
of a very plentiful supply of almost all the productions of the earth. Blessed as we are with the bounties of Providence, necessary for our support and defence, the fault must surely be our own, and great 
indeed will it be, if we do not by a proper use of 
them obtain the noble prize for which we have so 
long been contending, the establishment of liberty, 
peace, and independence. I am, dear Sir, &c.

TO TlIK rKKSIUK.NT OF CO.NUUESS. 

Hcad-Quartcrsi, Dobbs's Ferry, 8 August, 1781 

Sin, 

I do myself the honor to inform Congress, through 
your Excellency, that, at a late meeting between the 
American and British commissaries of prisoners, it has 
been proposed by the latter to go into a full exchange 
of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne and all the remaining 
officers of convention (by composition where rank will 
not apply) for the remainder of our officers in this 
quarter, and after them for those taken at the southward. One of the trrnis insisted upon is, that the prisoners surrendered by the capitulation of the Cedars, to 
the amount of four hundred and forty-three, shall be allowed. 

I have not thought myself at liberty to accede to 
these proposals without the concurrence of Congress, 
for the following reasons ; that I imagine our minister 
at the court of Versailles has been already directed to 
propose the exchange of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne 
for the Honorable Mr. Laurens ; that I do not know 
whether it would be agreeable to Congress to release 
the whole of the convention officers, before they have 
obtained a settlement for the subsistence of those 
troops ; and lastly because the refusal of the ratification of the convention of the Cedars has never been 
repealed. 

I would beg leave to remark on the two last, that 
the exchange of our full colonels can never be obtained 
but by composition, and that it is better to effect this 
by a composidon for inferior officers than for men, because the enemy gain no reinforcement by such a mode. 
To relieve the full colonels in this quarter only, who, all 
but one, have been prisoners since 1777, would take 
seven hundred privates. Should the security for the 
convention debt still be urged, I would answer, that we 
may perhaps deceive ourselves in supposing that the 
balance upon a general settlement, for the subsistence 
of all prisoners since the commencement of the war, 
will be much in our favor. I am inclined to think we 
shall find it the contrary, and owing to this, namely, 
that the British have constantly kept their accounts with 
accuracy and have vouchers ready to support them. 
We, on the other hand, shall be found very deficient 
on that score ; indeed, I fear almost totally so, except 
in the instance of the convention troops and prisoners 
of war latterly. 

Congress will judge of the expediency of repeahng 
their act i-especting the convention of the Cedars upon 
the present occasion. Mr. Skinner, the commissarygeneral of prisoners, will have the honor of delivering 
this to your Excellency. I shall be obliged by an answer to the several points contained in it, at his return, that I may instruct him accordingly. 

I have the honor to be, &,c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

King's Ferry, 21 August, 1781. 

Gentlemen, 

I have devoted the first moment of my time, which 
I could command (while the troops are halted for the 
French army at this place), to give my sentiments unreservedly on the several matters contained in your favor of the 13th instant. This I will attempt to do 
with all that frankness and sincerity, which, from your 
candor in your communications, you have a right to expect, and for doing which with the greater freedom the 
importance of the subject will be my apology. Persuaded that we are influenced by the same motives, 
and anxious in pursuit of the same object, I am only 
unhappy, that I should be forced to dissent in a single 
instance from the opinion of those, for whose judgment 
and ability I have the highest deference, respecting the 
surest and best mode for attaining that object. 

But, being at the same time fully sensible of the necessity of prosecuting the wiu- witli as much vigor as 
our circumstances will ailmit, and of using the strictest 
economy in the prosecution of it; upon these very principles, I beg leave to give it as my opinion, that a reduction of the number of ollicers and men as fixed by 
the last arrangement, or any material alteration of the 
establishment of the army for the next campaign, uoukl 
not in the present situation of alTairs be expedient, for 
the following reasons. 

In the iirst place, because the enemy must resolve to 
prosecute the war, or be disposed to make a peace ; in 
either of which cases, a respectable army in the field 
on our part will, I conceive, more than compensate the 
expenses of it, and will eventually he the best and 
most economical system of policy we can possibly act 
upon. For, should the enemy still be determined to 
carry on the war with obstinacy, not only policy, but 
even necessity, would urge us to keep up a superior 
army, as the surest and only means of forcing them to 
a peace, and freeing us from the calamities and expenses of the war ; as it is evident from many circumstances, that they have relied more for success on our 
want of exertions, than upon their own military prowess or resources, and that this has been one principal 
inducement of their persevering hitherto. But, on the 
other hand, should they be inclined to a pacification, 
a powerful and well appointed army would both enable u> to dictate our own terms at the negotiation, and 
hasten the completion of it. 

In addition to this, whoever considers how much 
more expensive and less serviceable militia are than 
Continental troops, how heavy and repeated a burden 
on the public their bounties are, when they are hired ; 
when drafted, how dis;\greeable and fretiuenlly distressing for them to be torn fi-om their families to a life with 
which they are totally unacquainted ; how precarious and 
uncertain the aid is, which may be expected from them 
hi such cases ; what glorious opportunities have been 
lost by us, and what almost ruinous advantages have 
been taken by the enemy in times of our weakness, 
for want of a permanent force in the field, — will, I am 
persuaded, be convinced, that we ought to have constantly such an army as is sufficient to operate against 
the enemy, and supersede the necessity of calling forth 
the militia except on the most extraordinary occasions. 
I will also beg leave to remind you. Gentlemen, of the 
great reduction of the number of regiments on the 
Continental establishment, namely, from one hundred 
and sixteen to fifty since the year 1777, and to observe, 
in consequence, that, in my opinion, we do not find the 
enemy so much exhausted, or their strength so debilitated, as to warrant any farther diminution of our established force. By one of the late intercepted letters 
from Lord George Germain, it appears the enemy considered the number of men, in their provincial corps 
only, greater than the whole number of men in the service of the continent. Since which time the reinforcements that have arrived from Europe amount, by the 
best accounts I have been able to obtain, to at least 
four thousand men. 

That the States are able, by proper exertions, to furnish the number of men required by the last arrangement of the army, may I think rationally be supposed ; 
as the population in many of them has rather increased 
than diminished since the commencement of the war; 
and as the greater part of them do actually, when 
called upon in an emergency, give a sufficient number 
of men for services of short duration to complete their 
Continental regiments. That the country abounds with 
supplies of all kinds is acknowledged from all quarters. 

Whctlier the men can be ohtainoil, or the resources 
drawn forth, is more ihim I will picsume with certainty 
to determine ; but one thing is certain, that it is idle 
to contend against great odds, when we have it in our 
power to do it upon equal or even advantageous terms. 

There are also several arguments, which I omit to 
enforce, that might be ailduced particularly to prove 
the impropriety of reducing the number of oilicers, or 
making any considerable alteration in the system ; 
such as our having found by experience, that the 
proportion of oilicers is not too great for the number 
of men ; that liic same or a greater proportion has 
been esteemed necessary in other more ancient services ; and that the full complement is more indispensably requisite in ours, because there is a larger number 
of levies and recruits to train and discipline annuiJly, 
than is to be found in the regiments of other nations ; 
and because a greater number of otlicers is taken from 
the line to perform the duties of the stall", than in 
most other services. It is likewise an established fact, 
that every alteration in the military system, or change 
in the arrangement, unless founded in the most obvious principles of utility, is attended with uneasiness 
among the oilicers, confusion with regard to the disposition of the men, and frequently with irregularities 
and disagreeable consequences before it is carried 
completely into execution. Perfect order throughout 
the whole army has but just been restored since the 
last arrangement took place. Another innovation in 
the present situation might be more mischievous in its 
effects. 

Thus I have, Gentlemen, from a desire of faithfully 
performing my duty, from the experience (of whatever 
degree it is) which I have acquired in the service of 
my country, and from the knowledge I have of the present state of the ai-my, given my sentiments on the 
first of your queries, which likewise involves the answer to the second. With regard to the third, I am 
of opinion, that the recruits ought if possible to be 
engaged for the war, or three years ; but, if this cannot 
be done, that the community, district, or class, furnishing a man for a shorter term of service, ought to be 
compellable to have him replaced by the period when 
his time of service expires ; and that funds ought to 
be established, if practicable, for recruiting the men 
engaged for short services, while they continue with 
the army, as it is found by experience that they may 
be enlisted with more facility and less expense, than 
under any other circumstances. With respect to the 
fourth, fifth, and sixth queries, I am in doubt whether 
any alteration can be made on those subjects, which 
shall tend essentially, all things considered, to the 
public good. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING HIS BRITANNIC 
majesty's ships of war at new YORK. 

Head-Quarters, 21 August, 1781. 

Sir, 

The almost daily complaints of the severities exercised towards the American marine prisoners in New 
York, have induced the Honorable the Congress of the 
United States to direct me to remonstrate to the 
commanding officer of his Britannic Majesty's ships of 
war in that harbour upon the subject, and to report 
to them his answer. The principal complaint now is, 
the inadequacy of the room in the prison -ships to the 
number of prisoners confined on board of them, which 
causes the death of many, and is the occasion of 
most intolerable inconveniences and distresses to those 
wliu siirvi\e. Tliis line of conduct is the more aggravating, as the want of a greater number of prisonships, or of sullicient room on shore, cannot be pleaded 
in excuse. 

As a bare denial of what has been asserted by 
so many individuals, who have unfortunately experienced the miseries I have mentioned, will not be 
satisfactory, I have to propose, that our commissarygeneral of prisoners, or any other oflicer, who shall 
be agreed upon, shall have liberty to visit the ships, 
inspect the situation of the prisoners, and make a report, from an exact survey of the situation in which 
they may be found, whether, in his opinion, there 
has been any just cause of complaint. I shall be 
glad to be favored with an answer as soon as convenient. I h;ne the honor to be, &,c.

I take the earliest opportunity to inform your Excellency, that, by a letter which the Count tie Rochambeau has received from Newport, the Count de

Chesapeake ; for which purpose he intended, if the 
winds should prove favorable, to depart from Newport on the 21st instant. This information is communicated to your Excellency, that you may take 
such measures as you shall think proper to facilitate 
the intended junction. 

From the progress already made in our march 
towards the Chesapeake, it is estimated that the troops 
may arrive at the Head of Elk by the 8th of September. That no delay may retard our embarkation, 
I take the liberty again to urge the necessity of your 
Excellency's sending up all your frigates and transports to the Head of Elk, in such time, that they 
may be sure of being there by the 8th of next month. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 

Ciiatham, 27 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Accounts brought by several vessels to Philadelphia 
and to the eastward leave little doubt, that the Count 
de Grasse must have already arrived in the Chesapeake, or that he must be very soon there. The 
Count de Rochambeau and myself have therefore 
determined that no time ought to be lost in making preparations for our transportation from Trenton 
to Christiana, and from the Head of Elk down the 
Chesapeake. I have written by this opportunity to 
Colonel Miles, and have directed him immediately to 
engage all the proper kind of craft for the navigation 
of the Delaware, which can be found in Philadelphia 
or in the creeks above and below it ; and, as your advice 
may be useful to him, more especially so far as respects procuring the vessels at a distance from Philadelphia, I have desired him to wait upon you for that 
purpose. I shall also be obliged to you for using your 
influence with the gentlemen of Baltimore, to permit 
any vessels that may be in that port to come up to 
Elk and assist us in transportation. I have little doubt, 
Ironi the cheerfulness with which they fiirnislietl the 
jManiuis last winter, that they will comply with yoiu 
requisition on the present occasion. But, lest there 
shoulil b(! a necessity for the interference of the executive of the State, I have written to Governor Lee 
upon that and other matters. I enclose the letter 
under a Hying seal for your information, and you will be 
good enough to forward it i)y a ciiain of expresses 
which is established. Any vessels, which may be procured in the Chesapeake, should rendezvous as soon 
as possible in Elk River. 

You will be pleased to make the deposit of flour, rum, 
and salt meat at the Head of Elk, which I requested 
in a former letter. I am very fearful that about fifteen 
hundred barrels of salt provisions, and thirty hogsheads of rum, which I directed to be sent from Connecticiit and Rhode Island under convoy of the Count 
de Barras, would not have been ready when the fleet 
sailed from iS'ewport. Should that have been the 
case, the disappointment will be great. I would wish 
you to see whether a like quantity of those articles 
can be procured in Philadelphia or in Maryland, if we 
should find that they have not gone round from the 
eastward. 

I must entreat you, if possible, to procure one 
month's pay in specie for the detachment, which I 
have under my command. Part of those troops have 
not been paid any thing for a long time past, and have 
upon several occasions shown marks of great discontent. The service they are going upon is disagreeable 
to the northern regiments ; but I malce no doubt that 
a douceur of a little hard money would put them in 
proper temper. If the whole sum cannot be obtained, 
a part of it will be better than none, as it may be 
distributed in proportion to the respective wants and 
claims of the men. The American detachment will 
assemble in this neighbourhood to-day ; the French 
army to-morrow. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Pliikflelphia, 2 September, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

Nothing could have afforded me more satisfaction 
than the information, communicated in your two letters of the 21st and 24th ultimo, of the measures 
you had taken, and the arrangements you were making, in consequence of the intelligence I had given 
you. Calculating upon the regular force under your 
immediate orders, the militia who have already been 
called for, and may be expected in the field, the 
French army, and the American corps now marching 
with Major-General Lincoln from the northward, in 
addition to the land forces expected on board of the 
fleet, I flatter myself we shall not experience any 
considerable difliculties from the want of men to carry 
our most favorite projects into execution. The means 
for prosecuting a siege with rapidity, energy, and success, and for supplying the troops while they are 
engaged in that service, as they are most precarious, 
have been and still continue to be the great objects of 
my concern and attention. 

Heavy cannon, ordnance stores, anil aniniunilion, to 
a pretty large amount, are now t'orwariling. General Knox, in whose iinmediate province these arrangements are, and who knows the whole of our resources, is 
making every exertion to Furnish a competent supply, 
aiul will he on the spot to remedy every deficiency, 
as far as the circumstances will possibly admit. Ilavinii also from the first moment been extremely anxious 
respecting the supplies of the army, (in which I comprehend not only provisions of the bread and meat 
kind, but also forage and the means of transportation,) 
I hail written pressingly to the governors of Maryland 
and Virginia on that subject previous to the receipt 
of your favor of the 21st of August. I have since 
reiterated my entreaties, and enforced, in the strongest 
terms I was capable of using, the requisitions for specific supplies made by Congress, and now again called 
for by the superintendent of finance from the states of 
Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland ; and, as to the supplies of Pennsylvania, we are to look for them from 
the financier himself. I hope and trust the efforts of 
these States and of Virginia will be uncommonly great, 
and proportionate to the magnitude of the object before us. 

In order to introduce some kind of system and 
method in our supplies, to know with certainty what 
may be depended upon, and to put the business in 
the best possible train of execution, I shall send forw^ard the heads of departments, as soon as their presence can be dispensed with. I have spoken to the 
surgeon-general respecting hospital stores and medicines. All that can be done will be done in that 
department. As to clothing I am sorry to inform you, 
that litde is to be expected, except in the article of 
shoes, of which a full supply will be sent on. 

In my progi-ess to the southward, I shall take care, 
as far as practicable, to make all the arrangements 
necessary for the operation in view, and to impress the 
executives with an idea of the absolute necessity of 
furnishing their quotas of supplies regularly ; as we 
have no other resources to rely upon for the support 
of the army, and especially, as I am very apprehensive, 
that a quantity of fifteen hundred barrels of salted 
provisions, which I had ordered to be shipped under 
convoy of the Count de Barras, did not arrive m time 
for that purpose. 

But, my dear Marquis, I am distressed beyond 
measure to know what has become of the Count de 
Grasse, and for fear that the English fleet, by occupying the Chesapeake, towards which my last accounts say they were steering, may frustrate all our 
flattering prospects in that quarter. I am also not a 
little solicitous for the Count de Barras, who was to 
have sailed from Rhode Island on the 23d ultimo, and 
from whom I have heard nothing since that time. Of 
many contingencies we will hope for the most propitious events. Should the retreat of Lord Cornwallis 
by water be cut olT, by the arrival of either of the 
French fleets, I am persuaded you will do all in your 
power to prevent "his escape by land. May that great 
felicity be reserved for you. 

You see how critically important the present moment is. For my own part, I am cleterniineil still to 
persist, with unremitting ardor, in my present plan, 
unless some inevitable and insuperable obstacles urc 
thrown in the way. Adirii. I am, &,e.

I do not find water-craft sufficient to embark the

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Head of Elk, G September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored by your Excellency's favor 
of the 2d instant, and do mysi-if the jilcasure to felicitate you on the happy arrival of so formidable a 
fleet of his Most Christian Majesty in the Bay of 
Chesapeake under your Excellency's command. This 
happy event I hope will be improved to the most 
salutary purposes for the united interests of both 
nations. 

Expecting to have the honor of a personal interview 
with your Excellency almost as soon as this will reach 
your h;\iu1, I shall not, in writing, give you the trouble 
of a particular detail of my designs. I will only inform you that the van of the two armies, the French 
and Americans, consisting of about two thousand men, 
(there not being transports for the whole) will embark in about two days, and will fall down the Chesapeake 
to form a junction with the troops under the command 
of the Count de St. Simon, and the ]\Iarquis de Lafayette, and to cooperate in blocking up CornwaUis m 
York River, and preventing him from making his retreat by land, or collecting any supplies from the 
country. This junction of the van of our troops is 
proposed to be made in James River, unless your Excellency and the commanders of the land troops should 
judge some other point of debarkation to be more 
favorable to our intentions; in which case you will be 
pleased to meet the transports while on their way, with 
orders to proceed to any other point which may be 
fixed on. 

The remainder of the troops from hence will be 
forwarded with all the expedition our circumstances will 
admit. In the mean time, as it will be of the greatest importance to prevent the escape of his Lordship 
from his present position, I am persuaded that every 
measure, which prudence can dictate, will be adopted 
for that purpose, until the arrival of our complete force, 
when I hope his Lordship will be compelled to yield his 
ground to the superior power of our combined forces. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

My dear Marquis, 

I have received with infinite satisfaction the information of the arrival of the Count de Grasse ; and have 
an additional pleasure in findmg, that your ideas on 
every occasion have been so consonant to my own, and 
that by your military dispositions and prudent measures you have anticipated all my wishes. Every thing has hitherto succeeded agreeably to my desires and 
expectations. The want of a sullicient number of 
vessels to transport the whole of the troops, ordnance, 
and stores at once, is only a misfortune that could not 
be avoided. 

We shall have transports enougii, I bclicvr, to embark iIr' heavy cannon, necessary stores, and the van 
of the American and French ai-mies, consisting of one 
thousand men from each, by to-morrow. No measure 
will be left unessayed, no cllbrt unattempted, to get 
forward the remainder of the troops and stores, and 
commence the operation as soon as it is possible in 
the nature of things to be done. I forl)car to enter 
into more pai-ticulars, as I shall set out for the theatre 
of action to-mon-ow, and hope to have the pleasure of 
communicating with you personally in a few days, and 
of making every arrangement, in conjunction with the 
admiral, which may be deemed necessary. I am, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to inform Congress, that I arrived 
at this place last evening ; that, soon after my arrival, 
I received the pleasing intelligence, that the Count de 
Grasse, who had put to sea on the 5th in pursuit of 
the British fleet, had returned to his former station at 
Cape Henry, having driven the British from the coast, 
taken two of their frigates, and effected a junction 
with the squadron of the Count de Barras. 

In consequence of my having been informed of the 
sailing of the fleet from the Capes, and being apprehensive that we were not assured of the security of 
our navigation in the bay, I had ordered the troops, 
who were embarked at the Head of Elk, to stop until 
we had further intelligence. Orders are this morning 
gone on to press them forward with every despatch 
possible. I am distressed to find, that the supplies of 
the army collecting here are on too precarious a footing. Already a want of provisions has been experienced. Every measure is taking, that is in my power, 
to be better assured of our supplies in future. How 
far I shall succeed in my endeavours, time must discover. I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 

Upon information of the sailing of the ileet from the 
Chesapeake Bay, I gave orders for the troops, who 
were enibarkeil, to be stopped. Since my ai-rival at 
this place, I am informed that Count de Grasse has 
been joined by Count de Barras, and, having captured two English frigates, has returned to his former 
station at the Capes. On this pleasing information 
I have sent forward Count Fersen to hurry on the 
troops with all possible despatch. Every day we now 
lose is comparatively an age. As soon as it is in our 
power with safety, we ought to take our position near 
the enemy. Hurry on then, my dear Sir, with your 
troops on the wings of speed. The want of our men 
and stores is now all that retards our immediate 
operations. Lord Cornwallis is improving every moment to the best advantage ; and every day that is 
given him to make his preparations may cost us many 
lives to encounter thoni. 

I am very sensible of your vigilance and activity. 
My impatience, however, to commence our operations 
impels me to write as I have done. You will come 
with your troops to the College Landing in James 
River, where, unless you receive other orders, you 
will debark. I am, &c.

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to receive your Excellency's letter 
of the 4th of this month soon after my arrival at this place. I am at a loss to express the pleasure, which 
I have in congratulating your Excellency on your return to your former station in the bay, and the happy 
circumstance of forming a junction with the squadron 
of the Count da Barras. I take particular satisfaction 
in felicitating your Excellency on the glory of having 
driven the British fleet from the coast, and taking 
two of their frigates. These happy events, and the 
decided superiority of your fleet, give us the happiest 
presages of the most complete success in our combined operations in this bay. 

It is with much regret, that I find the want of 
transports in the bay has retarded the progress of 
the troops expected from the northward. If it is 
possible for your Excellency to give us any assistance 
in this distress, it will be attended with inexpressible 
advantage to the prosecution of our measures, and will 
be acknowledged with the highest gratitude. Such of 
our troops, as could not be embarked at the Head of 
Elk, are marching to Baltimore, where they are to be 
put on board such transports as may be collected at 
that place. 

It is very much the wish of the Count de Rochambeau, as Avell as of myself, to have the honor of an 
interview with your Excellency ; but our particular 
circumstances render us dependent on your goodness 
for the means of conveyance. If your Excellency 
could despatch some fast-sailing cutter to receive us 
on board, and inform us as to the time and place, 
we shall be very happy to attend on you, at the earliest moment you shall fix. Count Fersen, an aid to 
Count de Rochambeau, is sent on to hurry down the 
troops that are embarking. If your Excellency can 
furnish him the means of proceeding up the bay, it will 
be very agreeable. I am, &c.

much pleasure, that your Excellency has anticipated

TO MAJOR-GENERAI. ST. CI, A IK. 

Williamsburg, 15 September, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I have to request you, in the most earnest manner, 
to send forward all the recruits that are furnished by 
the State of Pennsylvania for their line. Let it not 
be said, that those troops are kept from service for 
want of a few articles, which they could wish to be 
furnished with, when other troops doing duty in the 
field are combating almost every distress imaginable 
in the want of almost every necessary. If any thing 
in the power of the State can be instantly done towards their equipment, I wish the authorities to be 
called upon, and hope they will furnish what they can 
without delay. It is the highest absurdity in the world 
to keep those troops in a state of idleness at great 
expense, and at the same time for want of them to 
put the public to the same or much greater charge, 
by calling in the aid of militia, which we are now 
obliged to do. I beg you, therefore, to hurry on those 
troops, with all the expedition in your power, by water down the Chesapeake, embarking at Baltimore, where craft can doubtless be found by taking the 
proper precaution, and their transportation will be perfectly secure, so long as the fleet maintains its present station. The place of debarkation will be in James 
River, probably at the College Landing, unless further orders shall be given to carry them to some other place nearer the point of our operations. I am, &,c.

On my arrival at this place I tbund it would be attended with good consequences for me to see Admiral de Grasse in person. This visit I have performed, 
and met the Count on board the Ville de Paris at 
Cape Henry, from whence I have just returned. I am 
happy to inform Congress, that I found the French 
admiral disposed in the best manner to give us all the 
assistance in his power, and perfectly to cooperate 
with me in our present attempt. 

The vessels from the Head of Elk are now debarking their stores and troops, except some few w^hich 
are not yet arrived. This is accounted for from their 
being dull sailers. They are expected soon. I still 
find myself embarrassed for want of provisions, and 
sufficient means of transportation ; but by superior exertions I hope to surmount these difficulties, and to find 
myself soon before the enemy's works at York and 
Gloucester. I have the honor to be, &lc. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Williamsburg, 25 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

I cannot conceal from your Excellency the painful anxiety under which I have labored since the receipt of the letter, with which you honored me on the 2.3d 
instant. The naval movements, which your Excellency states there as possible, considering the intelligence communicated to you by Baron de Closen, 
make it incumbent upon me to represent the consequences that would arise from them, and to urge a perseverance in the plan already agreed upon. Give me 
leave, in the first place, to repeat to your Excellency, 
that the enterprise against York, under the protection 
of your ships, is as certain as any military operation 
can be rendered by a decisive superiority of strength 
and means ; that it is in fact reducible to calculation ; 
that the surrender of the British garrison will be important in itself and its consequences ; and that it must 
necessarily go a great way towards terminating the 
war, and securing the invaluable objects of it to the 
allies. 

Your Excellency's departure from the Chesapeake, 
by affording an opening for the succour of York, which 
the enemy would instantly avail themselves of, would 
frustrate these brilliant prospects ; and the consequence 
would be, not only the disgrace and loss of renouncing 
an enterprise, upon which the fairest expectations of 
the allies have been founded, after the most expensive preparations and uncommon exertions and fatigues, 
but perhaps the disbanding of the whole army for want 
of provisions. 

The present theatre of the war is totally deficient in 
the means of land transportation, being intersected by 
large rivers, and the whole dependence for interior 
communication being upon small vessels. The country 
has besides been so much exhausted by the ravages 
of the enemy, and the subsistence of our own army, 
that our supplies can only be drawn from a distance, 
and under cover of a fleet commanding the Chesapeake. I most earnestly entreat your Excellency farther to consider, that, if the present opportunity should 
be missed, and you should withdraw your maritime 
force from the position agreed upon, no future day can 
restore to us a similar occasion for striking a decisive 
blow ; that the British will be indcratigable in strengthening their most important maritime points ; and that 
the time or an honorable peace will be more remote 
than ever. 

The confidence, with which I feel myself inspired 
by ilic energy of character and naval talents, which so 
eminently distinguish your Excellency, leaves me no 
doubt, that, upon a consideration of the consequences, 
which must follow your departure from the Chesapeake, you will determine upon the measure, which 
the dearest interests of the common cause would dictate. I had invariably flattered myself, from the accounts given me by skilful mariners, that your position, 
moored in the Chesapeake, might be made so respectable as to bid defiance to any attempt on the part 
of the British fleet, at the same time that it would support the operations of a siege, secure the transportation 
of our supplies by water, and economize the most 
precious time by facilitating the debarkation of our 
heavy artillery and stores conveniently to the trenches 
in York River. It is to be observed, that the strength 
of the enemy's reinforcement under Admiral Digby, as 
we have the intelligence from the British, may not only 
be exaggerated, but altogether a finesse ; and, supposing the account consistent with truth, their total force, 
it was hoped, would not put them in a condition to 
attack with any prospect of success. 

If the stationary position, which had been agreed 
upon, should be found utterly impracticable, there is an 
alternative, which however inferior, considered relatively 
to the support and facility of our land operations, would 
save our affairs from ruin. This is, to cruise with your 
fleet within view of the Capes, so as effectually to prevent the entrance of any British vessels. 

Upon the whole, I should esteem myself deficient in 
my duty to the common cause of France and America, 
if I did not persevere in entreating your Excellency 
to resume the plans, that have been so happily arranged ; and, if invincible maritime reasons shall prevent, 
I depend as a last resource upon your pursuing the alternative above mentioned, and rendering the Chesapeake inaccessible to any enemy's vessel. 

However the British admiral may manoeuvre, and 
endeavour to divert your Excellency from the object 
in view, I can hardly admit a belief, that it can be his 
serious intention to engage in a general action with a 
fleet, whose force will be superior, supposing the most 
flattering accounts of the British to be true ; past experience having taught them to engage with caution, 
even upon equal terms, and forced from them acknowledgments, which prove the respect with which they 
have been inspired. Let me add. Sir, that even a momentary absence of the French fleet may expose us to 
the loss of the British garrison at York ; as in the 
present state of affairs. Lord Cornwallis might effect 
the evacuation with the loss of his artillery and baggage, and such a sacrifice of men as his object would 
evidently justify. 

The Marquis de Lafayette, who does me the honor 
to bear this to your Excellency, will explain many particularities of our situation, which could not well be 
comprised in a letter. His candor and abilities are well 
known to you, and entitle him to the fullest confidence 
in treating of the most important interests. I have 
earnestly requested him not to proceed any farther 
than the Capes, for fear of accidents, should your Excellency have put to sea. lu this eiise he will despatch 
a letter to you in addition to this. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

made on the present occasion, I flatter myself, that 
the result of the operations, conducted under your 
auspices, will compensate them by its utility to the 
common cause. Your Excellency may depend on every assistance, that the allied armies can give, relatively to the battery which you propose at Point Comfort, and that our utmost exertions will be used in

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Camp, near York, I October, 1781. 

Sir, 

Last evening I was honored with your Excellency's 
favor of the 21st with its enclosure. The intelligence 
contained in it, respecting the British fleet, is very 
agreeable, and has been transmitted to Admiral de Grasse. In my last I informed you, that our preparations for a near investment of the enemy at York 
were fast ripening to a point. I have now to acquaint 
your Excellency, that I marched from Williamsburg 
with the whole army on the 28th, and approached near 
to the enemy, about two miles from York, where a show 
was made of some opposition on our left ; but. Count 
de Rochambeau, who commanded that part of the army, moving some field-artillery towards them, under 
direction of the Baron Viomenil, and giving a few shot, they retired. (Jii the '2'Jl\\, the Anieriean iroops niovecl 
forward, and took their ground in front of the enemy's 
works on their left ; there being no opposition, save a 
few scattered shot from a small work by Moor's Mill, 
and a battery on the left of Pigeon Quarter. There 
was a small fire all day from our riflemen and the 
enemy's Yagers. On the 30th in the morning we discovered that the enemy had evacuated all their exterior works, and withdrawn themselves to those near 
the town. By this means we are in possession of very 
advantageous grounds, which command their line of 
works in a very near advance. All the expedition, 
that our circumstances will admit, is using to bring up 
our heavy artillery and stores to open our batteries. 
This work I hope will be executed in a few days, 
when our fire will immediately commence. 

The investment of the enemy is fully completed and 
drawn very near to their lines, saving the water communication above the town on York River. To complete that part, a request is gone to Count de Grasse, 
desiring him to push a ship or two above the town; 
which, if efl'ectcd, will answer many very valuable purposes. The position of Count de Grasse is judiciously taken, the main fleet being disposed in Lynnhaven Bay, and detachments made to secure the rivers ; and the determination of the Count seems to be 
fully to comply with our wishes in every necessary cooperation. I shall continue to keep Congress advised 
of such occurrences as are worthy the communication. 

I have the honor to be, <Scc.

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Before York, I October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I should have had the honor of acknowledging sooner the note, which your Excellency transmitted by the 
Marquis de Lafayette, but an expectation of being able 
to accompany my answer with interesting intelligence 
induced me to defer it to the present moment. With 
regard to the station, which your Excellency has determined for the main fleet, the reasons, which you are 
pleased to communicate, prove that it unites all advantages, and inspire the greatest confidence in the 
accomplishment of its object. 

I have only one proposition to submit on the subject of naval dispositions, and the objects of it are too essential not to be exposed in the fullest light. I mean 
the stationing two or three ships above the enemy's 
posts on York River. For the want of this only means 
of completing the investment of their works, the British remain masters of the navigation for twenty-five 
miles above them, and have, by their armed vessels, 
intercepted supplies of the greatest value on their way 
to our camp. The loss is redoubled, by diminishing 
our means and augmenting those of the enemy at a 
most critical time. We are even necessitated, for the 
protection of Williamsburg and the magazines in our 
rear, to leave a post of seven or eight hundred men in 
that quarter ; a diminution of our force that in present 
circumstances we can but ill support. But, unless this 
detachment is made, the enemy might in the greatest 
security land above Queen's Creek to cover their left 
flank, and by a very short march eflect the most destructive purposes; while the ch-cuitous march which 
we, from the nature of the country, should be obliged to nuike, would rciuk-r it impossible to arrive in time 
to prevent or punish them. We are besides reduced to 
the impossibility of concerting measures with the corps 
of troops at CJk)Ucester, being obliged, in order to communicate with them, to make a circuit of near ninety 
miles, whereas in the other case it would be both easy 
and expeditious. IJut what is a still more decisive consideration is, that Lord Cornwallis has, by the York 
River, an outlet for his retreat, and that he may, by 
embracing a leading wind and tide and stealing a march, 
proceed unmolested to West Point, where, upon debarking his troops, he will have the Panumky on one 
flank and the Mattapony on the other ; and that finally 
he may, by mounting the greater part of liis men, and 
by successive forced marches, push his way, with a 
compact, disciplined army, through a country whose 
population is too scattered to be collected for sudden 
opposition, and make it impossible for us to overtake 
him. Many people are of opinion, that Lord Cornwallis will embrace this as the only means of safety ; 
and it is certain, that, unless the investment is completed as above mentioned, he will have it in his power either now or in a last extremity. 

The present position of the fleet and army perfectly 
secures us against every enterprise on the part of the 
enemy in James River. 

Upon the whole, I can assure your Excellency, that 
this seems to be the only point in which we are defective. The enemy have already abandoned all their 
exterior works, and withdrawn altogether to the body 
of the place, and given us great advantages for opening the trenches. The engineers have had a near and 
satisfactory view of the works, without interruption, and 
we have most to apprehend Lord Cornwallis's escape. 

For these reasons I earnestly entreat, that you will 
be pleased to authorize and enjoin the commanding 
officer of the ships in York River, to concert measures 
with me for the purpose above mentioned. In this case 
an additional ship may be necessary to remain at the 
mouth of the river. The Experiment and two frigates, 
if your Excellency thinks proper, would be best calculated for the station above. 

If, upon mature examination of the passage, it should 
appear too great a risk for the ships, I would at least 
solicit your Excellency, that the vessels may advance 
higher up the river, and take a more menacing position 
with respect to the enemy on our right. But I must 
confess, that I am so well satisfied by experience, of 
the little eflect of land batteries on vessels passing 
them with a leading breeze, that, unless the two channels near York should be found impracticable by obstructions, I should have the greatest confidence in the 
success of this important service. 

Your Excellency's approbation of this measure would 
supersede the necessity of a defence against fire-ships. 
But the nature of the river besides renders it physically impossible to form any obstructions of the kind 
proposed. I entreat your Excellency to accept the 
sentiments of respectful attachment, with which I have 
the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 

Since mine to your Excellency of the 1st instant, 
we have been employed in repairing the enemy's works 
upon Pigeon Hill, and in constructing a new intermediate redoubt. These will serve to give security to 
our troops in making their approaches. We have been 
assiiluously eniplo}ed in making lUscines and gabions, 
and in transporting our heavy cannon, mortars, and 
stores from Trebell's Landing, on James River. In 
the last we made slow progress, until the airival of 
the wagons and teams from the northward ; but, it 
being the opinion of the engineers, that we now have 
a suflicient stock to commence operations, we shall 
this night open trenches. I take a very singular pleasure in congratulating Congress upon the very important and brilliant victory gained by General Greene 
on the 8th of September. I am, &,c.

every remark contained in your letter of the 12lh ultimo, and you may be assured, were the means of 
caiTying your wishes into effect under my control and

closed, and I hope it will terminate well, every thing 
which depends upon me, and all the influence I can 
exert, shall be used towards exterminating the British

we will at least endeavour to confine them within so 
narrow bounds, that they will scarcely have enough

My DEAR Sir, 

How happy am I, in at length having it in my power to congratulate you upon a victory as splendid as I 
hope it will prove important. Fortune must have been 
coy indeed, had she not yielded at last to so persevering a pursuer as jou have been. I hope, now she 
is yours, that she will change her appellation of fickle 
to that of constant. 

I can say with sincerity, that I feel with the highest 
degree of pleasure the good efTects, which you mention as resultiui^ from the perfect good understanding between you, the Marquis, and myself. I hope it will 
never be interrupted, and I am sure it never can be 
while we are all influenced by the same pure motive, 
that of love to our country and interest in the cause 
in wjiich we are embarked. I have happily had but 
few diflerences with those, with whom I have the honor 
of being connected in the service. With whom, and 
of what nature these have been, you know. I bore 
much for the sake of peace and the public good. My 
conscience tells me, that I acted right in these transactions ; and, should they ever come to the knowledge 
of the world, I trust I shall stand acquitted by it. 

Baron Steuben, from the warmth of his temper, had 
got disagreeably involved with the State, and an inquiry into part of Ills conduct must one day take 
place, both for his own honor and their satisfaction. I 
have for the present given him a command in this army, which makes him happy. I shall always take 
pleasure in giving Mrs. Greene's letters a conveyance ; 
and, should she persist in the resolution of undertaking so long a journey, as that from New England to 
Carolina, I hope she will make Mount Vernon, where 
Mrs. Knox now is, a stage of more than a day or two. 
With much esteem and regard, I am dear Sir, &:.c.

Head-Quarters, before York, 12 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I was yesterday honored with your favor of the 2d. 
It gives me pleasure to find so good a disposition in 
Don Bernardo de Galvez  to concert his operations in 
such a manner against the common enemy, that the 
interests of his Most Catholic Majesty and those of 
ourselves and our ally may be mutually benefited. 
You must be sensible, that, in the present political 
situation of affairs, I cannot, with any degree of propriety, in behalf of the United States propose any 
joint plan of operations to General Galvez, though I 
flatter myself that difficulty will be ere long removed. 

Neither can I at this time determine whether we 
shall be able to act offensively against the enemy in 
South Carolina and Georgia. That will in a great 
measure depend upon the naval assistance we shall 
be able to derive from our ally. Of this you may assure General Galvez, that, should any offensive plan be 
formed, which is to be undertaken by the allied arms, 
I will use my influence with the French commanders 
to give him due notice, should I not be able to open 
a correspondence with him myself. In the mean time 
you may inform him, that he cannot make a more powerful diversion in favor of the southern States, than by 
pushing his arms against East Florida. 

I am obliged by the extract of General Galvez's letter to the Count de Grasse, explaining at large the 
necessity he was under of granting the terms of capitulation to the garrison of Pensacola, which the commandant required. I have no doubt, from General Galvez's well known attachment to the cause of America, 
that he would have refused the articles, which have 
,been deemed exceptionable, had there not been very 
powerful reasons to induce his acceptance of them. 

I am, Su-, &.C.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, before York, 12 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

My last despatch to your Excellency was of the Gth. 
I then informed you, that we should open trenches that 
night. We did so, and cstahlisheil our lirst parallel 
within six hundred yards of the enemy's works, with 
the loss of only one ollicer of the French artillery 
wounded, and sixteen privates killed and wounded, the 
greater part of w lunn wcir of the French line. 

The 7th and 8th we were employed in completing 
the first parallel, and in erecting batteries somewhat 
advanced of it. On the 9th, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the American battery on the right opened, 
having six eighteen and twenty-four pounders, two 
mortars, and two howitzers ; and at three o'clock the 
French battery on the left opened, having four twelvepounders, and six mortars and howitzers. We were 
informed, that our shells did considerable execution in 
the town, and we could perceive that our shot, which 
were directed against the enemy's embrasures, mjured 
them much. The 10th, two French batteries, one of 
ten eighteen and twenty-four pounders, and six mortars and howitzers, the other of four eighteen-pounders, 
opened, as did two more American batteries, one of 
four eighteen-pounders, the other of two mortars. The 
fire now became so excessively heavy, that the enemy 
withdrew their cannon from their embrasures, placed 
them behind the merlins, and scarcely fired a shot 
during the whole day. In the evening the Charon 
frigate of forty -four guns was set on fire by a hot shot 
from the French battery on the left, and entirely consumed. Her guns and stores had been taken out. By 
the report of a deserter, our shells, w hich were thrown 
with the utmost degree of precision, did much mischief in the course of the day. 

Yesterday morning two oi" the enemy's transports 
were fired by hot shot and burnt. This has occasioned 
them to warp their shipping as far over to the Gloucester shore as possible. We last night advanced our 
second parallel within three hundred yards of the enemy's works, with little or no annoyance from them. 
Only one man was killed, and three or four wounded. 
I shall think it strange indeed, if Lord Cornwallis makes 
no vigorous exertions in the course of this night, or 
very soon after. 

I cannot but acknowledge the infinite obligations I 
am under to Count de Rochambeau, the Marquis de 
St. Simon, commanding the troops from the West Indies, 
the other general officers, and indeed the officers of 
every denomination in the French army, for the assistance which they afford me. The experience of many 
of those gendemen, in the business before us, is of the 
utmost advantage in the present operation. And I am 
sensible it must give your Excellency and Congress 
the highest pleasure to know, that the greatest harmony prevails between the two armies. They seem 
actuated by one spirit, that of supporting the honor of 
the allied arms, and pushing their approaches with the 
utmost vigor. I have the honor to be, &.c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, before York, 16 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to inform your Excellency in my 
last, of the 12th instant, that we had the evening before opened our second parallel. The 13th and 14th we wore finploycLl in completing it. Tlic engineers 
having deemed the two redoubts on the left of the enemy's line sudiciently injured by our shot and shells 
to make them practicable, it was determined to carry 
them by assault on the evening ol the 14th. The following tlisposition was accordingly made. The vsork 
on the enemy's extreme left was to be attacked by the 
American light intantry under the command of the 
Marquis de Lafayette ; the other by a detachment of 
the French grenadiers and chasseurs, commanded by 
Major-General the Biu-on Viomenil. I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that we succeeded in 
both. iVothing could exceed the lirmness and bravery 
of the troops. They advanced under the fire of the 
enemy without returning a shot, and effected the business by the bayonet only. The reports of his Excellency the Count de Rochambeau, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Lieutenant-Colonel Iliunilton, co[)ies of 
which I enclose, enter more particularly into a detail 
of the mode in which the attacks on the parts of the 
French and American columns were conducted. We 
made prisoners in both redoubts, one major, two captains, three subalterns, and sixty-seven privates. 

The works, which we have carried, are of vast importance to us. From them we shall enfilade the enemy's whole line, and I am in hopes we shall be able 
to command the communication from York to Gloucester. I think the batteries of the second parallel will be 
in sufficient forwardness to begin to play in the course 
of this day. The enemy last night made a sortie for 
the first time. They entered one of the French and 
one of the American batteries on the second parallel, 
which were unfinished. They had only time to thrust 
the points of their bayonets into the touch-holes of four 
pieces of the French and two of the American artillery, and break them ofl'; but the spikes were easily 
extracted. They were repulsed the moment the supporting troops came up, leaving behind them seven or 
eight dead, and six prisoners. The French had four 
officers and twelve privates killed and wounded, and 
we had one sergeant mortally wounded. I enclose to 
your Excellency a return of the killed and wounded 
of both armies up to the present time. It is much 
smaller thim might have been expected.

TO THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, near York, 19 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to inform Congress, that a reduction of the British army, under the command of Lord Corinvallis, is most happily eilectcd. Tlic uiiix-niittcd 
artlor, whicii actuatod every oflicer and soldier in the 
combined army on this occasion, has principally led to 
this important event, at an earlier period than my most 
sanECiiinr Imjics had induced me to expect. 

The singular spirit of emulation, which animated the 
whole army from the first commencement of our operations, has filled my mind with the highest pleasure 
and satisfaction, and had given me the happiest presages 
of success. 

On the 17th instant, a letter was received from Lord 
Cornwallis, proposing a meeting of commissioners to 
consult on terms for the surrender of the posts of 
York and Gloucester. This letter (the first that had 
passed between us) opened a correspondence, a copy 
of which I do myself the honor to enclose ; that correspondence was followed by the definitive capitulation, which was agreed to and signed on the 19tli, a 
copy of which I herewith transmit, and which, I hope, 
will meet with the approbation of Congress. 

I should be wanting in feelings of gratitude, did I 
not mention, on this occasion, with the warmest sense 
of acknowledgment, the very cheerful and able assistance, which I have received in the course of our 
operation from his Excellency the Count de Rochambeau. Nothing could equal this zeal of our allies, but 
the emulating spirit of the American officers, whose ardor would not suffer their exertions to be exceeded. 

The very uncommon degree of duty and fatigue, 
which the nature of the service required from the officers of engineers and artillery of both armies, obliges 
me particularly to mention the obligations I am under 
to the commanding and other officers of those corps. 

I wish it were in my power to express to Congress, 
how much I feel myself indebted to the Count dc Grasse and the officers of the fleet under his command, for the distinguished aid and support which have 
been aflbrded by them, between whom and the army 
the most happy concurrence of sentiments and views 
has subsisted, and from whom every possible cooperation has been experienced, which the most harmonious 
intercouj'se could afford. 

Returns of the prisoners, military stores, ordnance, 
shipping, and other matters, I shall do myself the honor 
to transmit to Congress, as soon as they can be collected by the heads of the departments to which they 
belong. 

Colonel Laurens and the Viscount de Noailles, on 
the part of the combined army, were the gentlemen 
who acted as commissioners for forming and settling 
the terms of capitulation and surrender, herewith transmitted, to whom I am particularly obliged for then 
readiness and attention exhibited on the occasion. 

Colonel Tilghman, one of my aids-de-camp, will 
have the honor to deliver these despatches to your 
Excellency ; he will be able to inform you of every 
minute circumstance, which is not particularly mentioned in my letter. His merits, which are too well known 
to need any observations at this time, have gained my 
particular attention, and I could wish that they may 
be honored by the notice of your Excellency and 
Congress. 

Your Excellency and Congress will be pleased to 
accept my congratulations on this happy event, and believe me to be, with the highest esteem, &c.

TO COUNT DE rjRASSE. 

Head-Quarters, 20 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

The surrender of York, from which so great glory 
and advantage are derived to the allies, and the honor 
of which belongs to your Excellency, has greatly anticipated our most sanguine expectations. Certain of 
this event, under your auspices, though unaltle to determine the time, I solicited your attention, in the hrst 
conference with which you honored me, to ulterior 
objects of decisive importance to the conmion cause. 
Although your answer on that occasion was unfavorable 
to my wishes, the unexpected promptness, with which 
our operations here have been conducted to their fmal 
success, having gained us time, the defect of which 
was one of your principal objections, a conviction of 
the most extensive and happy consequences engages 
me to renew my representation. 

Charleston, the principal maritime port of the British 
in the southern parts of the continent, the grand deposit and point of support for the present theatre of 
the war, is open to a combined attack, and might be 
carried with as much certainty as the place which has 
just surrendered. This capture would destroy the last 
hope, which induces the enemy to continue the war; 
for, having experienced the impracticability of recovering the populous northern States, they have determined 
to confine themselves to the defensive in that quarter, 
and prosecute a most vigorous offensive at the southward, with a view of reconquering States, whose sparse 
population and natural disadvantages render them infinitely less susceptible of defence, although their 
productions make them the most valuable in a commercial view. Their general naval superiority, previous 
to your arrival, gave them decisive advantages in the 
rapid transport of their troops and supplies, while the 
immense land marches of our succours, too tardy and 
expensive in every point of view, subjected us to be 
beaten in detail. 

It will depend upon your Excellency, therefore, to 
terminate the war, and enable the allies to dictate the 
law in a treaty. A campaign so glorious and so fertile 
in consequences could be reserved only for the Count 
de Grasse. It rarely happens, that such a combination 
of means, as are in our hands at present, can be 
seasonably obtained by the most strenuous human exertions ; a decisively superior fleet, the fortune and 
talents of whose commander overawe all the naval 
force, that the most strenuous efforts of the enemy have 
been able to collect ; an army flushed with success, 
demanding only to be conducted to new attacks ; and 
the very season, which is proper for operating against 
the points in question. 

If, upon entering into the detail of this expedition, 
your Excellency should determine it impracticable, 
there is an object, which, though subordinate to that 
above mentioned, is of capital importance to our southern operations, and may be eflected at infinitely less 
expense; I mean the enemy's post at Wilmington in 
North Carolina. Circumstances require that I should 
at this period reinforce the southern army under General Greene. This reinforcement, transported by sea 
ander your convoy, would enable us to carry the post in question with very little dilliculty, and would wrest 
Ironi the British a point of support in North Carolina, 
which is attended with the most dangerous consequences to us, and liberate another State. Tiiis object 
would require nothing more than the convoy of your 
fleet to the point of operation, and the protection of 
the debarkation. 

I entreat your Excellency's attention to the points, 
which I have the honor of laying before you, and that 
you will be pleased at the same time to inform me 
what are your dispositions for a maritime force to be 
left on the American station. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Uoad-Ciuarlere, 20 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do mv.>^eir the honor to enclose to your Excellency 
copies of returns of prisoners, arms, artillery, ordnance, 
and other stores surrendered by the enemy in their 
posts of York and Gloucester on the 19th instant, 
which were not completed at the time of my last 
despatches, and are but this moment handed to me. 
A draft of these posts, with the plan of attack and 
defence, is also transmitted, and twenty-four standards 
taken at the same time are ready to be laid before 
Con2;ress. 

Our operations against the enemy in this State being 
concluded, it becomes my duty to inform Congress 
of the disposition I have made for the future destination of the troops under my command. The Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia Continental troops 
are ordered as a reinforcement to the army under General Greene. I shall myself, with the troops of 
the States to the northward of Pennsylvania, return 
to my former position on the North River and the 
communications with it. The first mentioned division, 
composing a body of two thousand men, under the 
du-ection of the Marquis de Lafayette, will, on their 
way to South Carolina, make an expedition against 
the enemy's posts at Wilmington in North Carolina. 
To effect which purpose, they will be transported to 
a proper point of debarkation, under convoy of the 
Count de Grasse, who encourages me, if circumstances and the situation of the water will admit, to give 
them his cooperation, so long as shall be necessary to 
accomplish, by a coup de main, their object at Wilmington. Immediately upon the reduction of that post, the 
troops will proceed to join General Greene. 

That I may not, from the above arrangement, incur 
the censure of Congress, or the States, who may have 
flattered themselves with an expectation of my pushing my operations further southward than this State ; 
in justice to my own endeavours, and for the satisfaction of Congress, I find myself obliged to transmit to 
your Excellency a summary of reasons, which have 
induced my determination. In doing which, I take 
the liberty to submit to Congress copies of two propositions, which I have had the honor to make to Count 
de Grasse, with his answers to each. The first, which 
was made immediately on my arrival at Williamsburg, 
and is dated the 18th of September, will show, that 
other objects than the reduction of the British force 
under the command of Lord Cornwallis were early in 
my contemplation, and will also declare what were 
at that time the sentiments of the French admiral. 
The second proposition, made after the surrender of 
the British army, will evince with how much reluctance I was brought to relinquish a further prosecution 
of favorite views. In addition to these two communications, Congress will scarcely need to be informed, 
that, having no means of water conveyance, the transportation, by land, of the ai-my, with all their baggage, 
artillery, ordnance stores, and every appai-atus necessary for the siege of Charleston, would be impracticable, and attended with such immense troui)le, e.\pense, 
and delay, as would (exclusive of the necessity of 
naval cooperation) be suflicient to deter me from the 
undertaking ; especially as the enemy, after regaining 
the naval superiority on this coast, could reinforce or 
withdraw the garrison at pleasure. 

The prosecution, therefore, of the southern war, upon 
that broad scale which I had wished, being as I judge 
to be relinquished, nothing remained in my opinion 
more eligible, than to reinforce General Greene's army 
to such a state of respectability, as that he might be 
able to command the country of South Carolina, and 
at the same time, if possible, by that reinforcement to 
effect an accomplishment of the smaller object mentioned ; and to march myself, with the remainder of 
' the army, to the Nortli River, where they would be 
ready at the ensuing campaign to commence such 
operations against ISew York, as may be hereafter 
concerted, or to effect any other purposes that may 
be judged practicable or eligible. Add to these reasons, that Count de Rochaml)eau, from the exhausted 
state of his stores and other considerations, seemed 
inclined to take his resolution to remain in this State 
with his troops for the winter, at any rate six weeks 
to refresh them. Upon a full consideration of the 
reasons offered, I flatter myself, that my conduct will 
stand approved in the judgment of Congress, whose 
approbation I shall ever be solicitous to obtain. 

I enclose, also, for the observation of Congress, a 
copy of my letter to the ministers of the United States 
at the courts of Europe, conveying to them the intelligence of our success in this State against the British 
troops. The reasons for this conduct, as stated in that 
letter, I must rely upon, as my justification with Congress for the hberty taken by me in that communication. 

Unacquainted with the state of politics between 
Congress and the courts of Europe respecting future 
negotiations, whatever our prospects from that quarter 
may be, I cannot justify myself to my own mind 
without urging Congress in the warmest terms to make 
every arrangement for an early and efficacious campaign the ensuing year, that may be found necessary. 
Arguments, I flatter myself, need not be adduced to 
unpress on Congress the high importance of this idea. 
Whatever may be the events of the coming winter 
or ensuing summer, an effectual and early preparation 
for mihtary operations will put us upon the most respectable footing, either for war or negotiation ; while a relaxation will place us in a disreputable situation in point 
of peaceful prospects, and will certainly expose us to 
the most disgraceful disasters, in case of a continuance 
of the hostile disposition of our enemies. 

Nothing is yet heard of Admiral Digby, with his 
fleet, near these coasts. Whatever his intentions may 
be, Count de Grasse, I believe, is ready to meet him. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

P. S. October 29th. In the moment of closing my 
despatch, I am favored with the definitive determination of the Count de Grasse respecting the troops, 
whom I hoped to have transported to Wilmington by

the Martinis dc Lali\yctte, a copy of which I transmit

destined for the southern district liy land. They will 
commence their march in a few days, under the command of Major-Gcneral St. Clair. The command of 
the expedition against Wilmington had been promised 
to the Marquis, upon the contingency of the troops 
being transported by water. On the failure of this 
event, the Marquis does not proceed with the reinforcement. My present despatch being important, I have 
committed it to the care of Colonel Humphreys, one 
of my aids-dc-camp, whom for his attention, fidelity, 
and good services, I beg leave to recommend to the 
notice of Congress and your Excellency.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Camp, near York, 26 October, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

In answer to yours of the 24th, I beg leave to inform you, that as no immediate operation requires 
your presence in this country, I shall most cheerfully 
second your application to Congress for a six months' 
furlough for yourself and Colonel Gouvion, for the 
purpose of ai-ranging yom- private aflairs in France. 
The other request  appears to me to involve difficulties, that will deprive me of the pleasure, which, 
from a sense of your merit, I should feel on every 
possible occasion in promoting your views. In the 
present instance, the infringement of the rights of 
seniority in so many individuals, and the pretensions 
of some, who have particular claims upon their country, convince me that your desires could not be accomplished but at the expense of the tranquillity of 
the army. I cannot forbear adding at the same time, 
that it will always afford me the greatest pleasure to 
give the most particular testimony of the zeal, talents, 
and distinguished services of yourself and Colonel Gouvion ; and I entreat you to be persuaded of my 
earnest wish, that you may receive, at a more convenient opportunity, those rewards from Congress, 
which you deserve. I am, &,c.t

TO THE PRKSinENT AXD PROFESSORS OF THE L'MVERSITY OF WILLIAM AXD MARY. 

27 October, 1781. 

GENTLEMEy, 

I accept very kindly the address of the President 
and Professors of the University of William and ^Fary. 
The reduction of the British force in this State, for 
which I feel myself highly indebted to the noble exertions of our brave and generous allies, is a circumstance which gives me great pleasure, not only as it 
aflfords a return of peaceful security to many of my 
fellow citizens, but as it will, I hope, in its event be 
productive of more extensive good consequences. The 
seat of literature at Williamsburg has ever in my viewbeen an object of veneration. As an institution important for its communication of useful learning, and 
conducive to the diffusion of the true principles of 
rational liberty, you may be assured, that it shall 
receive every encouragement and benefaction in my 
power towards its recstabhshment. 

The sick and wounded of the army, whom my 
necessities have compelled me to trouble you with, shall 
be removed as soon as circumstances will pei-mit, an 
event which will be as pleasing to me, as agreeable to 
you. I am, &c.

TO COUNT DE GRASSE. 

Head-Quarters, 28 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency did me the honor to mention, in 
one of your letters, and subsequently in the note transmitted by the Marquis de Lafayette, that, from a desu-e to serve the United States, your Excellency would 
enter into engagements for such cooperations the next 
campaign as should not be incompatible with the orders 
of your court. This offer is too essential to the interests of the common cause, not to be embraced by 
me with the greatest eagerness, while it claims my 
warmest acknowledgments for the continuance of your 
friendly disposition towards America. As it is impossible, at this distance of time, to determine whether 
it will be most advantageous for the allies to open the 
campaign with the siege of New York, and thence 
proceed to that of Charleston, or make Charleston 
the leading operation, I take the liberty of proposing 
to your Excellency the following general dispositions, 
as equally applicable to either ; namely, that your 
Excellency would assemble a decisive naval superiority in the Bay of Chesapeake, towards the end of 
Miiy, from which central position \vc niiylit easily 
transport ourselves for a reunion of our means against 
whichever of the niiu-itime points above mentioned circumstances should render it most advisable to attack 
first. With your Excellency, I need not insist either 
upon the indispeusahle necessity of a maritime force 
capable of giving you an absolute ascendency in these 
seas, nor enlarge upon the advantages, which must be 
derived from anticipating the British in opening the 
campaign, next to the immediate prosecution of our 
present successes with the union of superior means 
now in our power, and which would infallibly terminate the war at one stroke. 

Tlie plan, which I have the honor to submit to your 
Excellency, is that which appears to me most likely to 
accomplish the great objects of the alliance. You will 
have observed, that, whatever eflbrts are made by the 
land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in 
the present contest. The court of France are convinced of it, and have declared their resolution to give 
this indispensable succour. The triumphant manner 
in which your Excellency has maintained the mastery 
of the American seas, and the glory of the French 
flag, lead both nations to look to you as the arbiter 
of the war. Public and private motives make me most 
ardendy wisli, that the next campaign may be Circulated 
to crown all your former victories. I entreat your 
Excellency to be persuaded of my regard for your glory, and of the sincere friendship with which I shall invariably continue, my dear General, &-c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Instructions. 

Sir, 

The detachment, of which you wUl have the command, for the southward is to consist of the Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia Continental troops. You 
will march them by the most convenient route, and in 
the most expeditious manner, without fatiguing the 
troops, towards Wilmington in North Carolina, or other 
posts in that State ; of which you will endeavour to 
dispossess the enemy, if their situation, from the intelligence you shall receive as you advance, shall in 
your judgment render it practicable and advisable. If 
it does not, you will continue your march to the southeiTi army, and put yourself under the command of 
Major-General Greene. 

As Wilmington and other places in North Carolina 
may cease to be objects, from a change of circumstances in the States to the southward of this, it will 
be necessary for you to open an immediate communication by letter with General Greene, and govern yourself by his advice and orders ; and it may be well to 
communicate, in confidence, to the Executive of the 
State of North Carolina the enterprise against Wilmington, that you may procure such information and aid 
as it may be in their power to give. For ordnance 
and stores, and for the means of transportation and 
other matters in the quartermaster's department, you 
will consult General Knox and Colonel Pickering, and 
win make your arrangements with the commissary, or State agent, for supplies of provision. Given at HeailQuariers, neiu- York in N'irginiii, this 2yih clay of October, 1781. 

P. S. ll there are any men upon iletaelunent, they 
are to be called in and mai-ched with their regiments. 
A suflicient number of officers must be left to carry 
on the sick and invalids as fast as they recover. Some 
good field-ollicers should remain to superintend the 
busmess.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Instructions. 

Sir, 

All the troops, who are about to return to the northward, will be under your command ; and I entreat you 
to use every means in your power to hasten them 
forward by land or water, or partly by both, as circumstances may requu'e. The ordnance, and stores 
of every kind, must be despatched, or in such train 
for it as to need no further cover or aid from the troops, 
ere they can move from their present encampment. 
The ordnance vessels, and vessels carrying stores of 
every other kind, should receive of sick, invalids, and 
weak men, as mimy as they can transport with safety 
and convenience ; after whicli, if there is not water 
transportation for the remainder, they must be marched 
by land, on the route by which the cavalry and teams 
came from the Head of Elk to this place. 

For the reputation of the troops, and preservation of 
property, you will use your utmost exertions to prevent any species of abuse on the march. Destruction 
of fences is too often among the wanton ijijuries, which are committed. A few axes, and strict attention of the 
officers, will infallibly prevent this, and I trust it will 
be done. You will be able, after informing yourself 
of the extent of the water transportation, to determine 
on the number of men, who must march by land, 
and make your arrangements with the quartermastergeneral accordingly. If there are any men upon detachment, they are to be called in and marched with 
their regiments. A sufficient number of officers must 
be left to take forward the sick and invalids, as fast 
as they recover. Some good field-officer should remain 
to superintend this business. Given at Head-Quarters,

TO GOVERNOR RUTLEDGE, SOUTH CAROLINA. 

Head-Quarters, near York, 31 October, 1781. 

Dear Sir,
 
I have to acknowledge your Excellency's two favors, and am not surprised at the urgency with which 
you express your sentiments on a subject of so much 
importance to yourself in particular, and to the general interest of the United States.f I have only to laiHL'ut, tliiit ii is not in my power to give you that satisfactory reply, which your forul liopes would lead you 
to expect. I can assure you, that every argument has 
been used with the Count de CJrasse to induce him to 
continue his stay on these coasts, and to aid with his 
lleet the combineti army in an operation against Ciiarleston ; hut without success. The advanced season, the 
orders of his court, and liis own engagements to be 
punctual to a certain time fixed upon for his ultenor 
operations, forbid a compliance on his part, and I am 
obliged to submit. 

An attempt to besiege Charleston, without the aid 
of a superior naval force, being utterly impracticable, a 
very respectable reinforcement of Continental troops is 
ordered for the support of General Greene; with which 
I flatter myself he will be able to command the country of South Carolina, and confine the enemy to the 
town of Charleston ; and I fancy to myself a future 
day, not far distant, w hen tliey will be obliged to abandon that place. As you will, before this can reach you, 
be fully informed of our success against Earl Cornwallis, I omit to add any thing on that subject, but beg 
your Excellency to accept my sincere congratulations 
on that favorable event. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, near York, 31 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a letter from General Duportail, in which he 
explains the motives of an intended application to Congress for permission to go to France, and for the promotion of himself and other officers of his corps. I 
should conceal sentiments, with which I am very strongly impressed, and do injustice to very conspicuous 
merit, if I did not upon the present occasion offer my 
testimony to the distinguished abilities and services, 
both of General Duportail and Colonel Gouvion. Their 
claim to the particular attention of Congress at this 
juncture is founded upon the practice of Europe ; 
sieges being considered as the particular province of 
the corps of engineers, and as entitling them, when 
attended with a success important in itself and its 
consequences, to the great military rewards. These 
officers, besides, are supported by a series of conduct 
in the line of their department, which makes them not 
depend merely upon the present circumstances. 

For these reasons, I am induced to recommend General Duportail's memorial to Congress for the promotions which he specifies, and the leave of absence ; the 
latter being by no means incompatible with the good 
of the service at the present period, as I am reduced, 
notwithstanding all my efforts, to the necessity of retiring into winter-quarters. The same principles as 
those above mentioned forbid me to be silent on the 
subject of General Knox, who is closely united with 
General Diiportail iti the merit of the siege ; being at 
the head ul' the artillery, which is the other principal 
instrument in conducting attacks. The resources of 
his genius have supplied, on this and many other interesting occasions, the defect of means. His distinguisheil t;ilents and services, equally important and 
indefatigable, entillc him to the same marks of the 
approbation of Congress, that they may be pleaseil to 
grant to the chief engineer. I am, &,c.

TO Tin: MAU<iUIS de lafayette. 

Mount Vernon, Virginia, 15 November, 1781. 

My dear Marquis, 

Not till the 5th instant was I able to leave York. 
Engaged in providing for the detachment that was to 
go southerly, embarking the troops that were to proceed northerly, making a distribution of the ordnance 
and stores for various purposes, and disposing of the 
officers and other prisoners to their respective places 
of destination, I could not leave that part of the country sooner. 

On that day I arrived at Eltham, the seat of Colonel Bassett, time enough to see poor Mr. Custis breathe 
his last. This unexpected and affecting event threw 
Mrs. Washington and Mrs. Custis, who were both present, into such deep distress, that the circumstance of 
it, and a duty I owed the deceased in assisting at his 
funeral, prevented my reaching this place till the 13th; 
and business here and on the road will put it out of 
my power to arrive at Philadelphia before the last days 
of the present month. 

As this may extend to a later period than your business in that city may require, I owe it to your friendship and to my affectionate regard for you, my dear 
Marquis, not to let you leave this country, without carrying with you fresh marks of my attachment to you, and new expressions of the high sense I entertain of 
your military conduct and other important services in 
the course of the last campaign, although the latter are 
too well known to need the testimony of my approbation, and the former I persuade myself you believe is 
too well riveted to undergo diminution or change. 

As you expressed a desire to know ray sentiments 
respecting the operations of the next campaign, before 
your departure for France, I will without a tedious display of reasoning declare in one word, that the advantages of it to America, and the honor and glory of it to 
the allied arms in these States, must depend absolutely 
upon the naval force, which is employed in these seas, 
luul the time of its appearance next yeai-. No land 
force can act decisively, unless it is accompanied by a 
maritime superiority ; nor can more than negative advantages be expected without it. For proof of this, 
we have only to recur to the instances of the ease and 
facility with which the British shifted their ground, as 
advantages were to be obtained at either extremity of 
the continent, and to their late heavy loss the moment 
they failed in their naval superiority. To point out the 
further advantages, which might have been obtained in 
the course of this year, if Count de Grasse could have 
waited, and would have covered a further operation to 
the southward, is unnecessary ; because a doubt did 
not exist, nor does it at this moment, in any man's 
mind, of the total extirpation of the British force in 
the Carolinas and Georgia, if he could have extended 
his cociperation two months longer. 

It follows then as certain as night succeeds the day, 
that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing 
definitive, and with it every thing honorable and glorious. A constant naval superiority would terminate 
the war speedily ; without it, I do not know that it w ill 
ever be terminated honorably. If this force should appear early, we shall have the whole campaign before 
us. The months from June to September inclusive are 
well adapted for operating in any of the States to the 
northward of this ; and the remaining months are 
equally well suited to those south ; in which time, with 
such means, I think much, I will add every thing, 
might be expected. 

How far the policy of Congress may carry them 
towards filling their Continental battalions does not lie 
with me to determine. This measure, before and since 
the capitulation, has been strongly recommended by 
me. Should it be adopted by that body, and executed 
with energy in the several States, I think our force, 
comprehending the auxiliary troops now here, will be 
fully competent to all the purposes of the American 
war, provided the British force on this continent remains nearly as it now is. But this is a contingency, 
which depends very much upon political manoeuvres in 
Europe ; and, as it is uncertain how far we may be in 
a state of preparation at the opening of the next campaign, the propriety of augmenting the present army 
under the command of Count de Rochambeau is a 
question worthy of consideration ; but, as it lies with 
Congress to determine, I shall be silent on the subject. 
If I should be deprived of the pleasure of a personal interview with you before your departure, permit me to adopt this method of making you a tender 
of my ardent vows for a propitious voyage, a gracious 
reception from your prince, an honorable reward for 
your services, a happy meeting with your lady and 
fiiends, and a safe return in the spring to, my dear 
Marquis, your affectionate friend, &c.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your

Congress of the 29lh, anil a proclamation for a day of 
public prayer and thanksgiving, and have to thank you, 
Sir, most sincerely for the very polite and affectionate 
manner in which these enclosures have been conveyed. 
The success of the combined arms against our enemies 
at York and Gloucester, as it affects the welfare and 
independence of the United States, I viewed as a most 
fortunate event. In performing my part towards its accomplishment, I consider myself to have done only my 
duty, and in the execution of that I ever feel myself

cause, I take a particular pleasure in acknowledging, 
that the interposing hand of Heaven, m the various instances of our extensive preparations for this operation, 
has been most conspicuous and remarkable. 

After the receipt of your favor, I received official

new choice of their president. While I congratulate you, Sir, on a release iVom the fatigues and troubles 
of so ariluous and important a task, I beg you to accept my sincere thanks for ibc pleasure and satisfaction, which I have received in the correspondence with

Alexandria, 20 November, 1781. 

Gentlemen, 

I accept with peculiar satisfaction the very kind and 
affectionate address of the citizens of Alexandria. The 
long experience, which in former times I have had of 
their sincerity and cordiality, stamps it with particular 
value ; and permit me to say, that, to make a peaceful 
return to this agreeable society of my fellow citizens, 
is among the most ardent of my wishes, and would 
prove my greatest comfort for all the toils and vicissitudes, which I have experienced during my absence. 

The great Director of events has carried us through 
a variety of scenes, during this long and bloody contest, in which we have been for seven campaigns most 
nobly struggling. The present prospect is pleasing. 
The late success at Yorktown is very promising, but 
on our own improvement of it depend its future good 
consequences. A vigorous prosecution of this success 
Avill, in all probability, procure us what we have so 
long wished to secure, an establishment of peace, liberty, and independence. A relaxation of our exertions 
at this moment may cost us many more toilsome campaigns, and be attended with the most unhappy consequences. 

Your condolence for the loss of that amiable youth, 
Mr. Custis, affects me most tenderly. The loss, I 
trust, will be compensated to you in some other worthy representative. 

Amidst all the vicissitudes of time or fortune, be 
assured. Gentlemen, that I shall ever regard with particular affection the citizens and inhabitants of Alexandria. I am, Gentlemen, &c.

TO GEORGE PLATER, PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, AND TH03IAS COCKEY DEY, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES, OF MARYLAND. 

Annapolis, 22 November, 1781. 

Gentlemen, 

I very sensibly feel the honor, which has this day 
been conferred upon me by the vote of thanks of so 
respectable a body, as that of the General Assembly of 
the State of Maryland. The regard, which they have 
been pleased to express for me personally, the delicate 
manner in which they have recalled to view those distant events, which in some degree led to our present 
happy situation, and the general approbation, which 
they have generously bestowed upon the whole of my 
conduct, must ever secure to them my warmest esteem, and must at the same time operate as fresh incentives to merit their future good opinion. 

It is with the highest degree of pleasure I observe, 
that a proper allowance lias been made for the capital 
share, which the land and sea forces of our great and 
good ally had in the reduction of the common enemy 
at York in Virginia. I should deem myself unpardonable, were I not upon every occasion, more especially 
upon such a one as the present, to declare, that to the 
sound counsels and vigorous exertions of their Excellencies Count de Rochambcau and Count de Grasse 
much, very much, was owing. 

While I agi-ee in sentiment with the honorable bodies 
over which you preside, that we may entertain a rational ground of belief, that, under the favor of Divine 
Providence, the freedom, independence, and happiness 
of America will shortly be established upon the surest 
foundation, I think it a duty incumbent upon me to 
observe, that those most desirable objects are not to 
be fully attained but by a continuance of those exertions, which have already so greatly humbled the power 
of our inveterate enemies. Relaxation upon our part 
will give them time to recollect and recover themselves ; whereas a vigorous prosecution of the war must 
inevitably crush their remaining force in these States, 
or put them to the necessity of entirely withdrawing 
themselves. 

I cannot conclude without expressing my warmest 
wishes for the prosperity of a State, which has ever 
stood among the foremost in her support of the common cause. I confess myself under particular obligations for the ready attention, which I have ever experienced to those requisitions, which, in the course of 
my duty, I have occasionally been under the necessity 
of making. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Dear Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge your favor of the 
6th instant, and to thank your Excellency with great 
sincerity for the very cordial and affectionate congratulations, which you are pleased to express on our late 
success in Virginia. 

I most earnestly hope, that this event may be productive of the happy consequences you mention ; and I think that its good effects cannot fail to be very extensive, unless, from a mistaken idea of the magnitude of this success, unhappily a spirit of remissness should 
seize the minds of the States, and they should set 
themselves down in quiet with a delusive hope of the 
contest being brought to a close. I iiope tliis may not 
be the case. To prevent so great an evil shall be my 
study and endeavour ; and I cannot but ihitter myself, 
that the States, rather than relax in their exertions, will 
be stimulated to the most vigorous preparations for 
another active, glorious, and decisive campaign, which, 
if properly prosecutid will, I trust, under the smiles of 
Heaven, lead us to the end of this long and tedious 
war, and set us down in the full security of the great 
object of our toils, the establislnnent of peace, liberty, 
and independence. 

Whatever may be the policy of European courts 
during this winter, their negotiation will prove too precarious a dependence for us to trust to. Our wisdom 
should dictate a serious preparation for war, and in that 
state we shall find ourselves in a situation secure 
against every event. 

Your Excellency's wish for some ships of our allies 
to be stationed at New London, I should have been 
happy to promote, if circumstances would have permitted ; but Admiral de Grasse has taken almost all 
his ships of war w ith him ; and, except a frigate or 
two left in York River for the security and aid of the 
French troops, who will have their w inter-quarters in 
the vicinity of Yorktown, not a ship of force is left 
upon the American station. The suiiply of fresh beef 
to the Island of Martinico is certainly a desirable object to our allies, and is worthy of attention, but no 
security can be given to its transportation from the 
quarter you mention. I am, &lc.

From the tenor of your private letter of this date, 
I presume you are unacquainted with my recommendation of General Knox to Congress, at the time General Dupt)rtail was nientioneel to that body by nie. If 
my expressions in his favor were not warm and lull, 
they fell as far short of my intention as of his merit, 
ami dill injustiee to both ; because I absolutely refused 
to recommend the latter without the former, wiiom I 
thought equally at least entitled upon every principle 
to promotion. If any thing further can be done by 
me, it must, I conceive, be obtained by some other 
means than a direct application to Congress. In the 
mean time I hope General Knox will take no hasty 
resolution, or at least suspend the execution of it, if 
he should. I am most sincerely yours, &,c.

I am induced to mention a subject, which has already

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 15 December, 1781. 

My dear Sir, 

I thank you for your kind congratulations on an 
event, which is certainly most important, considered in 
a public view, and which adds to my personal satisfaction, by finding that it in some degree relieves you 
from that load of difhculty and distress, with which 
you had so long been contending. The evacuation of 
the State of North Carolina is another very fortunate circumstance.

I presented your recommendation of Colonel Williams to Congress, backed by my own, urging the expediency of "filling up the vacant brigadierships ; and, 
if thought proper at this time, there is no doubt of 
Colonel Williams being promoted.f 

I hope General St. Clair has before this time joined 
you. The enemy have sent no reinforcement from 
New York to Charleston, nor do I learn that any preparations are making for such a measure. If it should 
be the opinion, that the British force in South Carolina 
is adequate to the maintenance of Charleston, I should 
not be surprised, if Sir Henry Clinton were to content 
himself with acting upon the defensive in that quarter, 
at least until the pleasure of the ministry can be 
known ; because an adilitional force, sullicient to regain and make establishments in the country, is more 
than can ucll be spared from New York. I am informed, that the English prints of a late date speak 
of a reinforcement pre[)aring from that city for Carolina 
and Florida ; and I think it not improbable, for I fancy 
Lord Cornwallis's private despatches, after the battle of 
Guilford, painted his affairs in no very favorable light. 

I am apprehensive that the States, elated by the late 
success, and taking it for granted that Great Britain 
will no longer support so losing a contest, will relax 
in their preparations for the next campaign. I am detained here by Congress to assist in the arrangements 
for the next year; and I siiall not fail, in conjunction 
with the financier, the minister of foreign allairs, and 
the secretary at war, who are all most heartily well 
disposed, to impress upon Congress, and get them to 
impress upon the respective States, the necessity of the 
most vigorous exertions. 

I really know not what to say on the subject of retaliation. Congress have it under consideration, and 
we must await their determination. Of this I am convinced, that of all laws it is the most dilTicult to execute, 
where you have not the transgressor himself in your 
possession. Humanity will ever interfere and plead 
strongly against the sacrifice of an iimocent person for 
the guilt of another ; and, as to destruction of property 
within the enemy's lines, it is in fact destroying our 
own. It will be to the eternal disgrace of the nation, 
which drives us to the disagreeable necessity of thinking 
of means to curb their barbarity. I am with the 
warmest sentiments of esteem, &.c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

PhUadelphia, 27 December, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with the resolves of the 20th 
instant, directing me to make inquiry into the power 
and conduct of the Board of Directors of the Associated 
Loyalists in New York. I shall pursue such steps as 
will be most likely to promote the ends which Congress 
have in view. 

I have taken the liberty of enclosing the copies of 
two letters from the commissary-general of prisoners, 
setting forth the debt, which is due from us on account 
of naval prisoners, the number remaining in captivity, 
their miserable situation, and the Uttle probability there 
is of procuring their release for the want of proper 
subjects in our hands. 

Before we proceed to an inquiry into the measures, 
which ought to be adopted to enable us to pay our debt, 
and to effect the exchange of those, who still remain 
in captivity, a matter which it may take some time to 
determine, humanity and policy point out the necessity of administorinnj to the pressing wants of a number of 
the most valuable subjeets of the repuljlic. Had they 
been taken in the Continental service, I should have 
thought myself authorized, in conjunction with the minister of war, to apply a remedy ; but as the greater 
part of them were not thus taken, as appears by Mr. Skinner's representation, I must await the decision of 
Congress upon the subject. Had a system, some time 
ago planned by Congress and recommended to the 
several States, been adopted and carried fully into execution, I mean that of obliging all captains of private 
vessels to deliver over their prisoners to the Continental 
commissioners upon certain conditions, I am persuaded 
that the numbers taken and brought into the many ports 
of the United States would have amounted to a sufliciency to have exchanged those taken from us ; but, 
instead of that, it is to be feared, that few in proportion 
are secured, and that the few, who are sent in, are so 
partially applied, that it creates great disgust in those 
remaining. The consequence of which is, that, conceiving themselves neglected and seeing no prospect of 
relief, many of them enter into the enemy's service, 
to the very great loss of our trading interest. Congress 
will, therefore, I hope, see the necessity of renewing 
their former or making some similar recommendation to 
the States. 

In addition to the motives above mentioned, for wishing that the whole business of prisoners of war might 
be brought under one general regulation, there is another 
of no small consideration, which is, that it would probably put a stop to those mutual complaints of ill treatment, which are frequently urged on each part. For 
it is a fact, that, for above two years, we have had 
no reason to complain of the treatment of the Continental land prisoners in New York, neither have we 
been charged with any improper conduct towards those in our hands. I consider the sufferings of the seamen 
for some time past, as arising in a great measure from 
the want of that general regulation, which has been 
spoken of, and without which there will constantly be 
a great number remaining in the hands of the enemy. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Philadelphia, 30 December, 1781. 

My DEAR Sir, 

You have enhanced the value of the trophies, with 
which Congress have been pleased to honor me in 
their resolve of the 29th of October, by the polite and 
affectionate manner of presenting them. When I consider how much I am indebted, for this singular mark 
of public esteem, to the exertions of the generals, and 
indeed of all the other officers, who accompanied me 
to that field of glory to the allied armies, I feel a sensation of gratitude, which I cannot express. Believe me 
sincere when I assure you, that I hold myself under 
very particular obligations for your able and friendly 
counsel in the cabinet and vigor in the field. I am 
with truth, my dear Sir, your very affectionate humble 
servant

TO THOMAS CHITTENDEN, VERMONT.

Philadelphia, I January, 1782. 

Sir, 

I received your favor of the 14th of November, by Mr. Brownson. You cannot be at a loss to know why I have not liLTctolbre, and wliy I cannot now, address 
you in your public character, or answer you in mine ; 
but the confidence, which you have been pleased to 
repose in me, gives nie an opportunity of ollering you 
my sentiments, as an individual wishing must ardently 
to see the peace and union of his country preserved, 
and the just rights of the people of every part of it 
fully and firmly estabhshed. 

It is not my business, neither do I think it necessary 
now, to discuss the origin of the right of a number 
of inhabitants to that tract of country, formerly distinguished by the name of the New Hampshire Grants, 
and now known by that of Vermont. I will take it for 
grantetl, that their right was good, because Congress 
by their resolve of the 7th of August imply it, and by 
that of the 21st are willing fully to confirm it, provided 
the new State is confined to certain described bounds. 
It appears therefore to me, that the dispute of boundary 
is the only one which exists, and that, this being removed, all further dilliculties would be removed also, 
and the matter terminated to the satisfaction of all parties. Now, I would ask you candidly whether the 
claim of the people of Vermont was not for a long time 
confined solely, or very nearly, to that tract of country 
which is described in the resolve of Congress of the 
21st of August last, and whether, agreeably to the tenor 
of your own letter to me, the late extension of your 
claim upon New Hampshire and New York was not 
more of a political manoeuvre, than one in which you 
conceived yourselves justifiable. If my first question 
be answered in the afhrmative, it certainly bars your 
new claim ; and, if my second be well founded, your end 
is answered and you have nothing to do but withdraw your jurisdiction to your old limits, and obtain an acknowledgment of independence and sovereignty, under 
the resolve of the 21st of August, for so much territory as does not interfere with the ancient established 
bounds of New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. I persuade myself you will see and acquiesce in the reason, the justice, and indeed the necessity 
of such a decision. 

You must consider. Sir, that the point now in dispute 
is of the utmost political importance to the future union 
and peace of this great country. The State of Vermont, if acknowledged, will be the first new one admitted into the confederacy, and, if suffered to encroach 
upon the ancient established boundaries of the adjacent 
ones, will serve as a precedent for others, which it may 
hereafter be expedient to set off, to make the same 
unjustifiable demands. Thus, in my private opinion, 
while it behoves the delegates of the States now confederated to do ample justice to a body of people 
sutliciently respectable by their numbers, and entitled 
by other claims to be admitted into that confederation, 
it becomes them also to attend to the interests of their 
constituents, and see, that, under the appearance of 
justice to one, they do not materially injure the rights 
of others. I am apt to think this is the prevailing opinion 
of Congress, and that your late extension of claim has, 
upon the principles I have above mentioned, rather 
diminished than increased the number of your friends, 
and that, if such extension should be persisted in, it will 
be made a common cause, and not considered as only 
affecting the rights of the States immediately interested in the loss of territory, a loss of too serious a 
nature not to claim the attention of any people. 

There is no calamity within the compass of my foresight, which is more to be dreaded, than a necessity of coercion on the part of Congress ; and consequently 
every endeavour should be used to prevent the execution of so disagreeable a measure. It must involve the 
ruin of that State against which the resentment of the 
others is pointed. 

I will only atkl a few words upon the subject of the 
negotiations, which have been cari-ied on between you 
and the enemy in Canada and in New York. I will 
take it for granted, as you assert it, that they were so 
far innocent, that there never was any serious intention 
of joining (ireat Britain in their attempts to subjugate 
your country ; but it has had this certain bad tendency ; 
it has served to give some ground to that delusive opinion of the enemy, upon which they in a great measure 
lound their hopes of success, that they have numerous 
friends among us, who only want a proper opportunity 
to show themselves openly, and that internal disputes 
and feuds will soon break us in pieces ; at the same time 
the seeds of distrust and jealousy are scattered among 
ourselves by a conduct of this kind. If you are sincere 
in your professions, these will be additional motives for 
accepting the terms, which have been offered, and 
which appear to me equitable, and thereby convincing 
the common enemy, that all their expectations of disunion are vain, and that they have been worsted in 
the use of their own weapon, — deception. 

As you unbosomed yourself to mo, I thought I had 
the greater right of .speaking my sentiments openly and 
candidly to you. I have done so ; and if they should 
produce the etFects, which I most sincerely wish, that 
of an honorable and amicable adjustment of a matter, 
which, if carried to hostile lengths, may destroy the 
future happiness of my country, I shall have attained 
my end, while the enemy will be defeated in theirs. 
Believe me to be, with great respect, Sir, &.c.

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE, AT PARIS. 

Philadelpliia, 4 January, 1789. 

My dear Marquis, 

I cannot suifer Colonel Gimat to leave this city tor 
France without a remembrance from me to you. I 
have remained at this place ever since you left it, and 
am happy in having discovered the best disposition imaginable in Congress to prepare vigorously for another 
campaign. They have resolved to keep up the same 
number of corps that constituted the army of last year, 
and have urged the States warmly to complete them. 
Requisitions of money are also made ; but how far the 
ability and inclinations of the individual States to tax 
heavily Avill coincide with the views of Congress, is 
more than I am able, at this early period, to inform 
you. A further pecuniary aid from your generous nation, and a decisive naval force upon this coast, in the 
latter end of May or beginning of June, unlimited in 
its stay and operations, would, unless the resources of 
Great Britain are inexhaustible, or she can form powerful alliances, bid fair to finish the war in the course of 
the next campaign. 

Aid in money would enable our financier to support the expenses of the war with ease and credit, without 
anticipating or deranging those funds, which Congress are endeavouring to establish, and which will be productive, though they may be slow in the establishment. 
A naval superiority would compel the enemy to draw their whole force to a point, which would not only disgrace their arms by the relinquishment of posts and the States which they aflect to have conquered, but might 
eventually be fatal to their army ; or, by attempting 
to hold these posts, they might be cut off" in detail ; so 
that, in either case, the most important good consequences would result from the measure. 

General Lincoln has accepted his appointiiiuui ol 
secretary of war. Proper plans of economy are ailoptini; in every depai-tnient, aiid I do not despair of seeing 
ere long our all'airs under nuich better management 
than they have been ; which will open a new fieid productive, it is to be hoped, of a fruitful harvest. As you 
will have received, in a more direct channel than I'rom 
hence, the news of the surprise and recapture of St. 
Eustatia l)y the arms of France, I shall only congratulate you on that event, and add, that it marks in a 
striking point of view the genius of the Marquis de 
Boullie for enteiprise, and for intrepidity and resources 
in didicult circumstances. His conduct upon this occa 
sion does him inhnite honor. 

I shall be impatient to hear of your safe arrival in 
France, and to receive such communications as you 
know will be interesting to the cause we espouse, and 
in which we are actors. Though unknown to Madame 
de Lafayette, I beg you to present me to her as one of 
her greatest admirers. Be so good also as to make a 
tender of my best wishes to the Duke de Lauzun, and 
other gentlemen of the army of Count de Rochambeau, 
who may be in the circle of your friends, and with 
whom I have the honor of an acquaintance. With 
sentiments of purest affection and most perfect regard, 
I am, my dear Marquis, your assured friend, &,c. 

P. S. — Januanj Hlh. Since writing the foregoing, I 
have had the letter and resolves, herewith sent, put into 
my hands by the delegates from Virginia in Congress. 
I have a peculiar pleasure in becoming the channel, 
through which the just and grateful plaudits of my 
native State are communicated to the man I love. By 
advices just received from South Carolina, the enemy 
have evacuated all their posts in that State, and have concentred their whole force in Charleston. Wilmington is also evacuated, and North Carolina is freed from 
its enemies. The disaffected part of the State are suing 
for mercy, and executing, it is said, some of their own 
leaders for having misguided them.

TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Circular to the States. 

Philadelphia, 22 January, 1782. 

Sir, 

Although it may be somewhat out of my province to 
address your Excellency on a subject not immediately 
of a military nature, yet I consider it so nearly connected with, and so essential to, the operations under my direction, that I flatter mysell' my interference will 
not be deemed impertinent. 

Upon applying to the superintendent of finance to 
know how f;ir I might depend upon him for the pay, 
feeding, and clothing of the army for the current year, 
and for the sums necessary to put it and keep it in motion, he very candidly laid open to me tiie state of our 
moneyed aflairs, and convinced me, that although the assistance we had derived from abroad was considerable, 
yet it would be by no means adequate to our expenses. He informed me further, that, to make up the deficiency, the States had been called upon by Congress 
for eight millions of dollars for the service of the year 
1782, and showed me the copy of a circular letter from 
himself to the several legislatures, in which he had 
so fully and clearly pointed out the necessity of a compliance with the requisition, that it is needless for me 
to say more on that head, than that I entirely concur 
with him in opinion, so fai- as he has gone into the matter. But there are other reasons, which could not be 
so well known to him as they are to me, as having 
come under my immediate observation, and which, 
therefore, I shall take the liberty to mention. 

Your Excellency cannot but remember the ferment, 
into which the whole army was thrown twelve months 
ago for the want of pay and a regular supply of clothing and provisions ; and with how^ much difficulty they 
were brought into temper, by a partial supply of the 
two first, and a promise of more regular supplies of 
all in future. Those promises the soldiery now begin 
to claim ; and, although we shall be able to satisfy them 
tolerably in respect to clothing, and perfectly in regard 
to provisions, if the financier is enabled to comply with his contracts, yet there is no prospect of obtaining pay, 
until a part of the money required of the States can 
be brought into the public treasury. You cannot conceive the uneasiness, which arises from the total want of 
so essential an article as money, and the real diiiiculties 
in which the officers in particular are involved on that 
account. The favorable aspect of our afiairs, and the 
hopes that matters are in a train to aflbrd them relief, 
contribute to keep them quiet ; but I cannot answer for 
the effects of a disappointment. 

Enabling the financier to comply with his contracts is 
a matter of the utmost consequence ; the veiy existence of the army depends upon it. Should he fail in 
his payments, the contract ceases, and there is no alternative left, but to disband or live upon the seizure of 
the neighbouring property. The saving to the public, 
by feeding an army by contract, is too well known to 
need any illustration, and that alone ought to be a sufficient inducement to the States to find the means of adhering to it. 

It will perhaps be urged, that the sum called for is 
immense, and beyond the ability of the country to pay. 
There is one plain answer to that objection, should it 
be made. It is, that, if the war is carried on, a certain 
expense must be incurred, and that such expense must 
be drawn from the people, either by a partial, cruel, and 
I may say illegal seizure of the property, which lies 
most convenient to the army, or by a regular and equitable tax in money or specific articles. Money, if it can 
be procured, is to be preferred, because it is neither 
liable to waste, nor is it expensive in the mode of collection or transportation. Whereas I think I may venture to say, that a great proportion of the specific 
articles has been wasted after the people have furnished 
them, and that the transportation alone of what have reached (he army has in numberless instances cost 
more than the vakie of the articles tlienisclves. 

To bring this war to a speedy and happy conclusion 
must be the fervent wish of every lover of his country ; 
and sure I am, that no means are so likely to elicct 
these as vigorous preparations for another cami)aigii. 
^Vhether, then, we consult our true interest, substantial 
economy, or sound policy, we shall find, that relaxation 
and languor are of all things to be avoided. Conduct 
of that kind on our part will produce fresh hopes and 
new exertions on that of the enemy ; whereby the war, 
which has already held out beyond the general expectation, may be protracted to such a length, that the 
people, groaning under the burthen of it, and despairing 
of success, may think any change a change for the 
better. 

I will close with a request, that your Excellency will 
be good enough to take the first opportunity of laying 
these sentiments before the legislature of your State. 
From the attention, which they have ever been pleased 
to pay to any former requisitions or representations of 
mine, I am encouraged to hope, that the present, which 
is equally important with any I have ever made, will 
meet with a favorable reception. 

I have the honor to be, &.c.

TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 

Philadelphia, 25 January, 1782. 

Sir, 

By a letter, which General Lincoln addressed to me 
before he went to the eastward, I find that you approve 
of my plan of sending officers to the four New England 
States particularly, with the returns of their deficiencies of troops, and with instructions to attend upon the 
legislatures, and endeavour to impress them with the 
expediency, and indeed necessity, of filling llieir battalions previously to the opening of the caiiipiiign. 

He informed me, also, that you would be glad to give 
the same officers some instructions relative to the business of your dL'i):irtnH'nt. If so, I could wish you 
woulil have your letters ready to go by the next post, 
by which time I expect to have the returns prepared. 
I have not yet fixed upon the gentlemen, but you can 
leave blanks for the inserUon of the names of those, 
who may be chosen. 

As w-e may reasonably expect to hear soon again 
from Sir Henry Clinton, on the subject of the meeting 
of commissioners, I think it would be well to be preparing the substance of the powers to be delegated 
to the gentlemen, to whom the transaction of the proposed business will be committed. What I would wish 
you to prepare particularly, is so much as will relate to 
the liquidation of the accounts of prisoners, and to 
making provision for their maintenance in future. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO PHILIP SCHUYLEK. 

Philadelphia, 29 January, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

I have no doubt, from the various and essential services you have rendered to your country, that you must 
be extremely obnoxious to the enemy. To protect 
your person against any insidious attempts from them, 
a guard was therefore ordered from the New York line ; 
but, as it is important that the troops should be collected, and the corps be kept together as much as 
possible this winter, I should wish all the men, who 
are able, might join their regiments at Pompton. And, in the mean time, I have enclosed an order to the 
commanding oflicer of the New Hampshire line to furnish a guard to replace the former, while those regiments continue at the northward. I hope in the spring 
there may be such a provision made of State troops, 
or levies, that this guard may also be relieved or taken 
off without hazard or inconvenience. 

Every information tending to prove, that the affairs 
respecting the Grants may be speedily and happily accommodated, gives me singular satisfaction. I will flatter myself, that both the articles of intelligence you 
have received are well grounded, and that it will be 
the unremitting effort of every one, who is well affected 
to the general cause, to prevent the horrors of civil 
discord in any part of the United States. It has been 
intimated, that some of the enemy's shipping and armed 
vessels have been detained by the ice in Lake Champlain in such a manner, that they might be destroyed 
and the cannon brought off. If the fact is so, I will 
thank you for as early and explicit information as possible, that measures may be taken accordingly. The 
destruction of those vessels, would, I think, greatly 
impede any future incursions from that quarter. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Circular to the States. 

Philadelphia, 31 January, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have the honor of transmitting herewith accurate returns of the number of men now actually in service from your State, in order that measures may be taken 
for completing the re,i;;iinents to tiie full estahlisliment, 
agreeably to the resolution of Congress on the 10th of 
December. I rannt)t omit so favorable an occasion 
of expressing to your Excellency my sentiments on 
that subject, and of entreating, in the most earnest 
manner, that there may be a speedy, pointed, and 
effectual compliance with those requisitions. 

It will, I flatter myself, be unnecessary to recapitulate 
all the arguments I made use of in the circular letter 
I had the honor to address to the governors of the 
several States, at the close of the campaign of 1780; 
in which, it must be remembered, I took the liberty to 
urge, from the knowledge I had of our alfairs and a 
series of experience, the policy, the expediency, the 
necessity of recruiting the army, as the only probable 
means of biinging the war to a speedy and happy 
conclusion. If those arguments had any influence at 
that time, if the consequent exertions were crowned 
with any success, if the present crisis exhibits new 
and more forcible inducements for still greater eflbrts, 
let me point your Excellency and the legislature to 
those considerations ; and especially let me recommend, 
in the warmest terms, that all the fruits of the successes, which have been obtained the last campaign, 
may not be thrown away by an inglorious winter of 
languor and inactivity. 

However, at this advanced stage of the war, it might 
seem to be an insult to the understanding to suppose 
a long train of reasoning necessary to prove, that a respectable force in the field is essential to the establishment of our liberties and independence ; yet, as I 
am apprehensive the prosperous issue of the combined 
operation in Virginia may have (as is too common in 
such cases) the pernicious tendency of lulling the country into a lethargy of inactivity and security ; and as I 
feel my own reputation, as well as the interest, the 
honor, the glory, and happiness of my country, intimately connected with the event, I will ask the indulgence to speak more freely on those accounts, and to 
make some of the observations, which the present moment seems to suggest. 

The broken and perplexed state of the enemy's affairs, and the successes of the last campaign on our 
part, ought to be a powerful incitement to vigorous 
preparations for the next. Unless we strenuously exert ourselves to profit by these successes, we shall not 
only lose all the solid advantages that might be derived 
from them, but we shall become contemptible in our 
own eyes, in the eyes of our enemy, in the opinion of 
posterity, and even in the estimation of the whole 
world, which will consider us as a nation unworthy of 
prosperity, because we know not how to make a right 
use of it. 

Although we cannot, by the best concerted plans, 
absolutely command success, although the race is not 
always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, yet, 
without presumptuously waiting for miracles to be 
wrought in our favor, it is our indispensable duty, with 
the deepest gratitude to Heaven for the past, and humble confidence in its smiles on our future operations, 
to make use of all the means in our power for our defence and security. This period is particularly important, because no circumstances since the commencement of the war have been so favorable to the recruiting service as the present, and because it is to be 
presumed, from the increase of population and the 
brilliant prospects before us, that it is actually in our 
power to complete the army before the opening of the 
campaign. However flattering these prospects may be, iiukIi slill rc'inains to be clone, which cannot probably 
l)e etlcctCLl unless the army is recruited to its cstablislmient; and consequently the continuance or termination of the war seems principally to rest on the Aigor 
and decision of the States in this interesting point. 
And, finally, it is our first object of policy, under every 
supposuble or possible case, to have a pouerl'ul army 
early in tiir field; for we must suppose the enemy are 
either disposed to j)rosecute the war, or to enter into a 
negotiation for peace. There is no other alternative. 
On the former supposition, a respectable army becomes 
necessary to counteract the enemy, and to prevent 
the accumulating expenses of a lingering war ; on the 
latter, nothing hut a decidedly superior force can enable 
us boldly to claim our rights and dictate the law at the 
pacification. So that, whatever the disposition of the 
enemy may be, it is evidently our only interest and 
economy to act liberally, and exert ourselves gready 
during the present winter to cut ofi" at once all the 
expenses of the war by putting a period to it. 

And soon might that day arrive, and we might hope 
to enjoy all the blessings of peace, if we could see 
again the same animation in the cause of our country 
inspiring every breast, the same passion for freedom 
and military glory impeUing our youths to the field, and 
the same disinterested patriotism pervading every rank 
of men, that was conspicuous at the commencement 
of this glorious revolution ; and I am persuaded, that 
only some great occasion was wanting, such as the 
present moment exhibits, to rekindle the latent sparks 
of that patriotic fire into a generous fianie, to rouse 
again the unconquerable spirit of liberty, which has 
sometimes seemed to slumber for awhile, into the full 
vigor of action. 

I cannot now conclude this letter without expressing my full expectation, that the several States, animated 
with the noblest principles and convinced of the policy 
of complying faithfully with the requisitions, ^\■ill be only 
emulous which shall be foremost in furnishing its quota 
of men; that the calculations of the numbers wanted 
to fill the deficiencies may be so ample as, allowing for 
all the casualties and deductions, will be sufficient certainly to complete the battalions ; that the measures for 
this purpose may be so explicit, pointed, and energetic, 
as will inevitably furnish the recruits in season; and 
that such checks may be established to prevent imposition, as to the quality of the men, that no recruits 
may be accepted but those, who ai-e in fact able-bodied 
and effective. Should any of a different description be 
sent to the army, they must be rejected, the expense 
thrown away, and the service injured, though others 
are required to fill their places ; for it is only deceiving 
ourselves with having a nominal instead of a real force, 
and consuming the public provisions and clothing to 
no eflect, to attempt to impose decrepit and improper 
men or boys upon us as soldiers. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Philadelphia, 9 February, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your Excellency's favor of 
the 12th and 22d ultimo, the latter enclosing copies 
of General Greene's letter to you and your answer. 
After mforming you that I concur with you in opinion, 
that it would not be politic at this moment to move a 
detachment from your main body to the southward, 
permit me to assure you, that I very sensibly feel your goodness in cleterminins to advance the legion as soon 
as possible lo the huiitiers of North Carolina. I have 
only to request, that the commanding ollicer may have 
orders to proceed further or not as circumstances may 
reijuire. The move of the legion will be perplexing to 
the enemy ; and, as it has been heretofore tiie advance 
corps of your army, you may, I think, give out, and it 
will ciu-ry w ith it strong marks of probability, that your 
whole army is to follow, as soon as the weather will 
admit of the march. Supposing the enemy sliould receive the reinforcement from Ireland, I do not imagine 
that they will, after the many severe blows they have 
felt from plunging themselves into the country, march 
to any great distance from Charleston ; especially if they 
consider, that, while France has a naval superiority ia 
the West Indian or American seas, a body of troops 
might be easily thrown in between them and the town, 
whereby their ruin would be inevitable. 

It would certainly be our true interest, if it could be 
done, to give General Greene sucli a force, that he 
should be able, under all circumstances, to keep the 
enemy confined to their posts upon the coasts of South 
Carolina and Georgia ; but, should your excellent and 
valuable body of men be made use of for that purpose, it might possibly interfere with the plan of the 
campaign, which we may shortly expect from your 
court. Those States, whose troops compose the southem army, will be pressed to send forward reinforcements to General Greene as early and as expeditiously 
as possible. 

I am apprehensive that your Excellency will think 
me unmindful of a most agreeable piece of duty, which 
I have been directed to perform by Congress. It is 
the presentation of two of the field-pieces taken at 
York, with an inscription engraved on them expressive of the occasion. I find a difficulty in getting the engraving properly executed. When finished, I shall with 
peculiar pleasure put the cannon into your possession. 

In an address, which I have lately received from the 
Senate of the State of Virginia, on account of the surrender of York and Gloucester, I am desired to make 
their most grateful acknowledgments to your Excellency and to the officers and men under your command, for your eminent services upon that occasion, 
and to assure you, that they see with pleasure the 
harmony, which subsists between the inhabitants of the 
State and their generous allies. I take the first opportunity of making this agreeable communication. 

In my letter of the 14th of January, I requested 
that Lord Rawdon might be exchanged for BrigadierGeneral Moultrie of South Carolina, in preference to 
any of the colonels mentioned by Sir Henry Clinton ; 
it being more conformable to our practice than to make 
exchanges by composition. I now take the hberty of 
confirming that request. I am, &lc.

TO COLONEL ARMAND, AT CHARLOTTESVILLE. f 

PhUadelphia, 13 February, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

I am favored with your letter of the 25th of January, 
and am happy to inform you, that Colonel Ternant and 
the other gentlemen of your corps are exchanged. 
Arrangements are made with the financier respecting 
the recruidng money, of which Colonel Ternant will 
give you a satisfactory account ; and also acquaint you 
with the steps, that have been taken to procure the greater part of the hor=;es liy confraet. Colonel Carringtoii, quartermaster to the soutlieni army, wlio is 
now in this town, before he returns to Virginia, will 
be enableil to make such provision for furni.-shing tlic 
supplies reqiiiretl from that ileparlmeiil, as I hope will 
free you from further trouble on that subject. The 
secretary at wai- will inform you whether the addition of an oflicer to each troop of cavalry was meant 
to extend to the legionary corps or not. 

I have to request, that you will not lose a moment's 
time in marching as large a number of your legion as 
possible to join the army under the orders of MajorGeneral Greene. By arriving at a critical period the 
corps may possibly have an opportunity of signalizing 
itself, and rendering essential service to the public. 
Colonel Ternaiit, wlio is the bearer of this, will be 
able more fully to enforce the reasons of my sentiments and wishes. You will perceive that oflicer is 
appointed inspector to the southern army. It is an office of importance, and requires a gentleman of ability 
and activity to perform the duties of it with propriety. 
I pray you will be persuaded, that I can never be 
unmindful of the zeal and attachment you have always 
discovered for the service, and (hat, I am, with great 
regard, dear Sir, &,c.

TO Till". PRESIDENT OF CO.VGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 18 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to enclose copies of the reports of the commissary-general of prisoners, who has 
just returned from New York, with copies of the papers to which he refers. Your Excellency will perceive thereby, that the restriction upon the exchange 
of Lieutenant-General Earl Cornwallis operates against 
the hberation of Brigadier-General Scott, seven colonels and two lieutenant-colonels, who, upon the principles of the tarifl' established between us and the enemy, are equivalent to his Lordship in value. 

I also enclose the copy of a letter from Sir Henry 
Clinton, by which it would appear that the exchange 
of Mr. Laurens might be effected for Earl Cornwallis, 
should Congress think proper to accede to the proposal. I beg leave to remark upon that letter, that there 
has been some misconception either on the part of 
Colonel Laurens or Lord Cornwallis, as to what passed on the subject in Virginia. Colonel Laurens asked 
me there, whether, supposing an exchange could be 
effected between his father and his Lordship, I should 
have any objection to it. I answered, none personally, 
and that, as Congress had made no difficulty in offering General Burgoyne for Mr. Laurens, I thought they 
might now probably offer Lord Cornwallis, but that the 
matter did not depend upon me. This I find has 
been construed into absolute consent on my part. 

With i-espect to the policy of prohibiting the exchange of Lord Cornwallis I will not pretend to determine. I cannot, however, help observing, that it operates disagreeably in giving uneasiness to those officers 
of ours, who can only be exchanged by composition, 
and who are by the enemy set against him, and that it 
may be considered as a departure from the spirit of 
the terms of the capitulation of York. 

Mr. Sproat's proposition of the exchange of British 
soldiers for American seamen, if acceded to, will immediately give the enemy a very considerable reinforcement, and will be a constant draft hereafter upon 
the prisoners of war in our hands. It ought also to be considered, that few or none of the naval prisoners 
in New York and elsewhere belong to the Continental 
service. I however feel for the situation of these nnfortunate people, and wish to see them relieved by any 
mode, which will not materially allect the public good. 
In some former letters upon this subject I have mentioned a plan, by which I am certain they might be 
liberated nearly as fast as captured. It is by obliging 
the captains of all armed vessels, both public and private, to throw their prisoners into common stock under the direction of the commissary-general of prisoners. By these means they would be taken caie ol 
and regularly applied to the exchange of those in the 
hands of the enemy. Now the greater part are dissipated, and the few that remain are applied partially. 
I shall be obliged to your Excellency for obtaining and 
transmitting to me the sentiments of Congress upon 
these subjects as early as convenient, 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS.

Philadelphia, 18 February, 1782. 

My dear Laurens, 

I have had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 10th of December, and also the report of the judicious and successful movement of General Greene, by which 
he compelled the enemy to abandon their out-posts. This brilliant manccuvre is another proof of the singular abilities which that officer possesses. 

Since my last despatches from South Carolina I have been informed, by way of Virginia, of the intelligence General Greene had received, that a reinforcement was 
expected from Ireland, of the application he had made in consequence to the Count de Rochambeau, and of the resolution the Count had taken of detaching the 
legion of Lauzun to his aid. I hope this force, together with the corps of Armand, will give such a decided superiority of cavalry, as will prevent the enemy from reoccupying and ravaging the country again, 
should the whole reinforcement from Ireland arrive. 
And I must confess, that I cannot entirely rely upon 
it, as I have not heard the intelligence from any other 
quarter, although a frigate has just arrived at New 
York with the King of England's speech, and despatches from administration. Nothing however has 
transpired except the speech, from the complexion of 
which no decisive opinion can be formed. 

But I think a little time will disclose what the enemy's intentions are, should they still persist in the 
prosecution of the war, and whether they mean to occupy the two great posts of New York and Charleston, or concentrate the whole of their force together. 
In the former case, reinforcements may undoubtedly 
be expected ; and I know of nothing, which can be 
opposed to them with such a prospect of success, as 
the corps you have proposed should be levied in 
Carolina. To make the campaign decisive is our 
great object. I wish that the States might be impressed with the necessity of taking their measures 
accordingly, and that the war might not be procrastinated by want of exertion on our part. Believe me, my dear Laurens, I am convinced, under all circum-stances, of your unbountled zeal in the service of your 
country. That success may ever attend you in the pursuit of person;\l glory anil public felicity, is the eai-nest wish of your atlectionate friend, &c.

TO Tin: IMIKSIDENT OF CONGRKSS. 

Philadelphia, 20 J^bruary, 1782. 

Sir, 

Since ray letter to your Excellency of the 18tli instant, I have been honored with the pubhc and secret 
resolves of Congress of the same date ; the former 
empowering me to appoint commissioners for the purposes therein mentioned, the latter prohibiting the exchange of Lieutenant-General Lord Cornwallis by composition, which is the only mode by which he ever 
can be exchanged, except for civil characters, we having no military grade answerable to his.

I find myself so exceedingly embarrassed by the 
operation of the secret resolve, that I hope Congress 
will excuse me for pointing out the difficulties in which 
it involves me personally, and the manner in which it 
affects, as I conceive, the public good. By the public 
resolve all former restrictions are taken off, and I am 
at liberty to go into a general exchange without limitation. When it therefore shall be found, that Lord 
Cornwallis is still detained, those officers of ours (particularly our full colonels, most of whom can only be 
exchanged on composition), who will be sufferers on 
that account, will naturally apply to me for the reasons. I must either submit to their opinions of a conduct so apparendy strange, or, to justify myself, must 
be under the necessity of betraying a secret vote of 
Congress. 

In order more clearly to point out the manner, in 
which the secret resolve, if adhered to, will operate 
against the public interest, I must beg leave to request the attention of Congress to a short recital of 
the reasons, which induced me, at this particular time, 
to propose a meeting of commissioners to the British 
Commander-in-chief. 

On my return from Virginia, the superintendent of 
finance informed me, that the subsistence of the prisoners of war had now become so serious a matter, that 
there was an absolute necessity of endeavouring to obtain paymont of the money already due to us upon 
tliat account, and at all events to fix uj)()n some certain an(l regular mode of payment for llieir maintenance in future. In order to efTect these objects, he 
advised my makin;^ propositions to Sir Henry Clinton 
lo a|ipoinl commissioners, not only to licjuidate the accounts of prisoners, but to endeavour, by the establishment of a permanent cartel (a matter, which we 
have never yet been able to obtain), to adjust a number of points relating to the exchanges and accommodation of prisoners, for want of which, individuals, as 
well the subjects of the United States as those of 
Great Britain, are daily sufiering. 

Sir Henry Clinton, after several letters had passed 
between us on the subject, acceded to the proposition 
in the most extensive sense. Commissioners were 
named, and I only waited for the authority of Congress to enable me to invest the commissioners on 
our part with proper powers. This by the public resolve of the 18th is amply granted, but by the subse 
quent secret resolve it is in a manner done away. 
The powers of our commissioners can only have reference to the public resolve, and whatever stipulations 
are entered into will be upon a confidence, that no 
further obstructions will be thrown in the way. The 
exchange of Lord Cornwallis (as heretofore) would be 
one of the first things demanded ; and, should that be 
rejected, as it must be, the enemy would not only 
have it in their power to tax us with a breach of 
faith, but thev might recede in turn from any part of 
their agreements ; and it is to be feared, that they 
would pitch upon that respecting the payment for the 
maintenance of their prisoners, as it will be a weighty 
matter to them, and one which they can evade with 
less inconvenience than almost any other, as we have a very great number of theirs to support, and they few of ours. 

In addition to what I have said, I have only further 
to remark, that the gentlemen, who have been named 
by me to execute the commission, have objections to 
going upon it, unless they can meet those from the 
British on fair and open terms. This can only be done 
either by withdrawing the secret vote entirely, or by 
adhering publicly to the resolution of detaining Lord 
Cornwallis, and trying what can be effected under such 
circumstances. The last would remove my present 
scruples, if it should not be deemed a violation of the 
capitulation ; but I fear, as I before mentioned, that the 
general interest would suffer by the measure. We 
never can expect that such a cartel, as will be really 
beneficial to us, will be acceded to while an officer of 
Lord Cornwallis's high rank and family influence is 
excepted, nor indeed while a power is reserved or 
implied of being able to deprive of the right of exchange any other officer, who may hereafter as a prisoner of war become entided to the advantages of a 
stipulation of such a nature as a cartel. 

I ever with diffidence enter into discussions of the 
above kind, and I am now more than commonly apprehensive, that my conduct may appear reprehensible, as 
Congress have been pleased, upon several late applications, to adhere to their former opinions respecting 
Lord Cornwallis. Had I not seen new difficulties 
arising from restricting his exchange, I should have deemeil myself as inexcusable in further controverting 
the will of Congress, as I should have been, had I remained silent when I thought my voice might have conduced to the general good. That this has been my 
only motive for taking up so much of your time I beg 
you will believe, as sincerely as that I am, with the 
utmost respect, &,c.

TO SIR HENRY CLINTON. 

Philadelphia, 26 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have appointed the meeting of our respective commissioners to be at Elizabethtown on the 15th of next 
month. If I hear nothing further from your Excellency, I shall take it for granted, that you accede to the 
time and place. And I would propose, as is usual in 
such cases, that a cessation of hostilities should take 
place, during the meeting, from Amboy to Newark, 
both included. 

As my commissioners will go fully authorized to 
treat of the exchanges of Lord Cornwallis and the 
Honorable Mr. Laurens, I have no occasion to be particular in my answer to your Excellency's letter on 
that subject. I shall only observe, that I apprehend 
Lord Cornwallis misunderstood Colonel Laurens, in 
the conversation they had upon that matter in Virginia. I could never have given an assurance, that 
his Lordship should be exchanged for Mr. Laurens, 
the father of the colonel, as I had no authority to 
make any such stipulation. 

I have the honor to be, &,c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL WILLIAM IRVINE. 

Instructions. 

Sir, 

You will proceed with all convenient despatch to Fort Pitt, the object of your command, and you will take such measures for the security of that post and 
for the defence of the western frontier, as your Continental force combined with the militia of the neighbouring country will admit. Under present appearances 
and circumstances, I can promise no further addition to your regular force, than a proportion of recruits for 
the Virginia and Pennsylvania regiments, which are already upon the western station ; consequently offensive 
operations, except upon a small scale, cannot just now 
be brought into contemplation. You may, however, 
still continue to keep yourself informed of the situation of Detroit, and the strength of the enemy at that 
place. 

With respect to the subject of the letters, which you 
have lately received from Colonel Gibson, I can only 
repeat what I have said to you personally. You must 
endeavour to convince both officers and men, that 
measures are actually taking to put them upon such a 
footing with regard to their provisions, clothing, and 
pay, that it is to be hoped they will ere long have no 
reason to complain. They will have already found the 
difference between their past and present mode of obtaining provisions and clothes ; and they cannot therefore doubt, that the only remaining difficulty, which is 
on account of pay, will be removed as soon as the 
financier can reap the advantages of the taxes for the 
current year, which are but just laid, and cannot therefore come yet into use. The officers and men must, 
upon a moment's reflection, be convinced of the wisdom dl" applying? the public money in hand to prociirinj;- vicliial.s and clotiu'S. Tiu-y cannot be dispensed 
with even for a day; and whru \»>\\\ are assured that 
certificates of pay, due to the 1st of the present yeai-, 
will be i^ivon with interest, and that pay thenceforward 
will be more regular anil as frequent as the public 
treasury will admit, they ought to be satisfied. 

Should the troops composing the western garrison 
be discontented with their situation, and think that they 
are partially dealt by, you may make them an oiler of 
being relieved and of taking their chance of the emoluments, which they may suppose accrue to those serving 
with either the noilhern or southern armies. There 
may be policy in this oiler, because, if I am not mistaken, most of the men, who have connexions in the 
upper country, would rather remain there at some disadvantage than be brought away from their families. 

You will make such arrangements, as shall comport 
with the above instructions and the strictest principles 
of economy, with General Knox and the quartermastergeneral respecting military and other stores necessary 
for the posts under your orders ; and you will, I am 
persuaded, use every means in your power to prevent 
any waste or embezzlement of them. Given at HeadQuarters, at Pliiladelphia, the 8th of March, 1782. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Instructions. 

Gentlemen, 

The powers of equal date herewith authorize you 
to proceed to Elizabelhtown, in the State of New Jersey, in order to meet commissioners on the part of the 
enemy, on Friday the 15th instant, for the purposes 
in the powers fully recited. 

You will consider the settlement of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners of all descriptions from the 
commencement of the war to ; obtaining payment, or security for the payment, of the large 
balance, which it is presumed was due to the United States at that period, and establishing some certain arrangements for the regular payment of the subsistence of prisoners from that time forward, as the 
principal objects of your commission. 

From the want of an appointment of a commissary 
of prisoners until some time after the commencement 
of the war, from the variety of hands to which the 
charge of prisoners was committed, and from the little 
attention, which was for a long time paid to the sums 
expended for their support, I fear it will be difficult for 
you to collect the materials necessary to form our account with sufficient accuracy to satisfy yourselves, or 
to gain credit with the commissioners on the part of the 
enemy. And it is also probable, that the accounts, 
which will be produced by them, will be alike subject 
to many objections for want of proper vouchers and 
other causes. 

You are therefore at liberty, if you find no probability of being able to make a regular settlement, to 
compound the matter, by fixing upon such a sum as 
shall appear to you reasonable, which sum shall, upon 
payment, be looked upon as a full and final discharge 
of all demands on the part of the United States from 
the commencement of the war to the time which you 
shall specify. Y'ou air, then, in order to prevent ;)11 
luture disputes, to determine, ot" what a ration for the 
support of a prisoner of war sluill niutuaily consist ; 
the value of that ration, not only in whole, hut in its 
component parts ; what vouchers shall he esteemed mutually valid ; and to obtain and give proper assurances 
lor the reguhir monthly and (juarterly payments of the 
balances, as they may respectively become due. 

Before you proceed to the negotiation of exchanges, 
you will pay due regard to the resolve of Congress 
of the 23d of February last, with a copy of which 
you are furnished, which authorizes the exchange of 
Lieutenant-General Earl Cornwallis only upon certain 
conditions therein specified. By the word liberulcd, 
in the resolve referred to, it is not to be understood, 
that Mr. Laurens is to be given up without any equivalent. At what the enemy will rate him is uncertain. 
Congress once oflered a lieutenant-general for him; and, 
if the same should be demanded now, and insisted upon, you are at liberty to comply. If circumstances 
should render the exchange of Lord Cornwallis impracticable, the respective commissaries of prisoners 
may proceed to the exchange of other officers ; and, 
if the enemy should persist in their resolution of detaining a certain number of our officers of rank, as a 
counter security to our detention of Lord Cornwallis, 
it may be submitted to, upon the following principle, 
that it will be better for four or five gentlemen (the 
number who will be involved) to remain in captivitVj 
than the whole, amounting to considerably above one 
hundred. 

In compliance with a resolve of Congress of the 20th 
of December last, a copy of which and some papers 
relating to it you have herewith, you will enter into a 
discussion with the British commissioners upon the powers and conduct of the Board of Dii-ectors of the 
Associated Loyalists in New York, and you will endeavour to devise some means for the prevention of 
that kind of depredation, which is complained of. On 
this subject you will do nothing conclusive, but report 
to me the substance of the measure, which may have 
seemed to the British commissioners and yourselves 
most likely to answer the end. 

I recommend to your particular attention the case 
of one Summers, a native of Pennsylvania, taken in 
1778, and yet detained upon Long Island, notwithstanding every reasonable offer has been made to procure his exchange. The commissary of prisoners can 
inform you fully of his situation and circumstances. 

Should you enter into either a general or special 
cartel, you will endeavour to stipulate, that, in future, 
citizens not in arms shall not be considered as subjects of capture, but in particular cases, such as for 
guides, for intelligence, and such hke purposes ; and 
that they shall be well treated, and discharged after 
the ends for which they were captured are answered. 

Should the admiral accede to my proposition of 
sending commissioners to meet you, on the subject of 
tlie treatment and exchange of marine prisoners, you 
will endeavour in the first place to obtain a change in 
the mode of keeping our seamen confined. The daily 
complaint of the miseries incident to confinement on 
board prison-ships will authorize you to remonstrate 
warmly on that head, and to insist upon an alteration 
of conduct. In respect to the support and mode of 
payment for the subsistence of seamen, you will be 
guided by the instruction relating to the rations of 
soldiers. 

You are acquainted with the difficulties under which 
we labor, as to the means of procuring the exchange of the Aiiiericau seamen, \vli() fall into the hands of the 
enemy. It but rarely happens, that those captured l)y 
private vessels of war are given up to the Continental 
commissaries. Some are taken into our service, many 
escape through negligence, and therefore it is that the 
balance of marine prisoners has been generally greatly 
against us. The mode proposed by Admiral Digby 
of giving up land prisoners for seamen is altogether 
inadmissible. It would prove a constant source of reinforcement to the enemy. Under present circumstances I do not see, that you can come to any final 
determination upon the mode of exchanging or liberating seamen. Should commissaries meet you on that 
subject, you w^ll in conjunction with them form a plan, 
which may be deemed mutually equitable and convenient, and report upon it. 

You have herewith the copies of the letters, whicli 
have passed between the British general and admiral 
and myself upon the subject of your commission. The 
superintendent of finance will furnish you with materiEds for stating our claims for subsistence of prisoners, 
so far as he has been able to obtain them ; and the 
commissary of prisoners will furnish you with any official papers, which may be in his possession, and 
which may be found necessary to the accomplishment 
of a general or special cartel. Given under my hand 
and seal, at Philadelphia, the Uth day of March, 1782. 

P. S. Since the above, I have been furnished by 
Congress with a number of representations respecting 
the treatment of our marine prisoners. I have thought 
it proper to put them into your hands, that you may 
make the necessary use of them.

TO JAMES MCHENRY. 

Philadelphia, 12 March, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

The fair hand, to whom your letter of the 20th of 
January was committed, presented it safely, and, as you 
rightly observed, the value of it was enhanced thereby. 
Good laws, ample means, and sufficient powers, may 
render the appointment of your intendant  a public 
benefit ; and, from the spirit of your people, I hope 
these are provided. Without them, the appointment 
must be nugatory. Never, since the commencement 
of the present revolution, has there been in my judgment a period, when vigorous measures were more consonant with sound policy than the present. The speech 
of the British King, and the addresses of the Lords 
and Commons, are proofs to my mind of two things ; 
namely, their wishes to prosecute the American war, 
and their fears of the consequences. My opinion of 
the matter is, therefore, that the minister will obtain 
supplies for the current year, prepare vigorously for another campaign, and then prosecute the war, or treat 
of peace, as circumstances and fortuitous events may 
justify ; and that nothing will contribute more to the 
first, than a relaxation or apparent supineness on the 
p.irt of these States. The debates upon the addresses 
evidently prove, what I have here advanced, to be true ; 
for these addresses, as explained, are meant to answer 
any purpose the ministers may have in view. What 
madness then can be greater, or what policy and economy worse, than to let the enemy again rise upon our folly 
and want of exertion I Shall we not be justly chargeable for all the blood anil treasure, which shall be 
wasted in a lingering war, procrastinated by ialse expectations of peace, or timid measures for the prosecution of it ? Surely we shall ; and much is it to be 
himented, that our endeavours do not at all times accord with our wishes. Each State is anxious to see 
the end of our wariare accomplished, but shrinks when 
it is called upon for the means ; and either withholds 
them altogether, or grants them in such a way as to 
defeat the end. Such, it is to be feared, will be the 
case in many instances respecting the requisitions of 
men and money. 

I ha\e the pleasure, however, to inform you, that the 
Assembly of this State, now sitting, have passed their 
supply-bill without a dissenting voice, and that a laudable spirit seems to pervade all the members of that 
body ; but I fear, notwithstanding, that they will be deficient in their quota of men. It is idle at this late period of the war, when enthusiasm is cooled, if not done 
awav, when the minds of that class of men, who are 
proper subjects for soldiers, are poisoned by the high 
bounties which have been given, and the knowledge 
of the distresses of the army so generally difiused 
through every State, to suppose that our battalions can 
be completed by voluntary enlistment. The attempt is 
vain, and we are only deceiving ourselves and injuring 
the cause by making the experiment. There is no 
other efTectual method to get men suddenly, but that 
of classing the people, and compelling each class to 
furnish a recruit. Here every man is interested ; every 
man becomes a recruiting ollicer. If our necessity for 
men did not press, I should prefer the mode of voluntary enlistment ; as it does, I am sure it will not answer, and that the season for enterprise will be upon 
us long ere we are ready for the field. 

The anxious state of suspense, in which we have 
been for some time, and still remam, respecting the 
naval engagement in the West Indies and the attempt 
upon Brimstone Hill in the Island of St. Kitl's, is disagreeable beyond description. The issue of these 
events must be very interesting, and may give a very 
unfavorable turn to affairs in that quarter, and to America in its consequences. With much sincerity and affection, I am, &c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

PhUadelphia, 18 March, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

It gives me the more pain to hear of your distresses 
for want of clothing and other necessaries, as you are 
at so great a distance, that you cannot be suddenly relieved, even if we had the means. I am not, however, 
without hopes, that, should the war be continued to the 
southward (of which I have my doubts, for reasons 
which I shall presently give), matters will be put into a 
much better train than they have hitherto been. The 
arrangements made already, by the superintendent of 
finance, have been attended with infinite public advantages, and he is extending those arrangements as fast as 
circumstances will possibly admit. I am sorry to see a 
jealousy, arising from a supposition that there has been 
a partiality of conduct. I am certain there has been no 
such intention, and that, instead of a charge of having 
done too little, it will soon be a matter of wonder how 
Mr. Morris has done so much with so small means. As 
I know he corresponds with you on the affairs of his 
department, I shall content myself with saying, that, before Colonel Carrington leaves town, measures will be 
taken to enable him to make provision in future for the 
ready transportation of stores, and for the accommodation of troops moving to the southward. It is agreed 
that the laboratory shall be removed from Richmond to 
New London. 

In my former letters upon this subject, I acquainted 
you with the reasons, which operated against Count de 
Rochambeau's detaching more than the legion of Lauzun towards South Carolina, upon yom requisition for a 
reinforcement. Although my instructions to you did 
not mention a power to call upon the Count for assistance, yet I look upon it as implied in my desire to you 
to correspond with him. The circumstances of the 
moment must determine whether any or what can be 
spared by him. 

By late advices from Europe, and from the declarations of the British ministers themselves, it appears, that 
they have done with all thoughts of an excursive war, 
and that they mean to send but small, if any further reinforcements to America. It may be also tolerably plainly 
seen, that they do not mean to hold all their present 
posts, and that New York will be occupied in preference to any other. Hence, and from other indications, 
I am induced to believe that an evacuation of the southern States will take place. Should this happen, we must concentrate our force as the enemy do tliL-irs. You 
will, tliciLTore, upon tlic appearance of such an event, 
immediately malic preparations for the march of the 
arm) uiulcr your command to the northwartl. What 
troops shall, in that case, be left in the southern Stales, 
will be a matter of future discussion. 

No other reinforcement went from New York to 
South Carolina, than that of the four hundred who had 
arrived. Letters, which you had not received when 
you last wrote, will have informed you, that our first 
intelligence respecting the number of men embarked 
was false. With the highest sentiments of esteem, I 
am, my dear Sir, &,c.

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Philadelphia, 19 March, 1782. 

Sir, 

Under present appearances, I think General de Choisy 
should not move beyond Charlotte Court-House. There 
are several reasons to induce a belief, that the enemy 
mean to evacuate South Carolina and Georgia. If such 
an event is to take place we must soon know it. I requested the minister of finance to inform you, thai 
whenever it became necessary I would meet you at 
this place. Mount Vernon, exclusive of the happiness 
of entertaining you at my own house, would be very 
agreeable to me, but I could not at the openmg of the 
campaign go so far from the army. I congratulate your 
Excellency upon the total surrender of the Islands of St. Kjtt's and Nevis, which is fully confirmed. Montserrat must, I think, fall of course. I have also the 
pleasure to inform you, that the Marquis de Lafayette, 
and the gentlemen who went with him, all arrived safe 
in France after a passage of twenty-two days. I shall 
set out for the army to-morrow. I am, &c.

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR MORRIS, AT ELIZABETHTOWN. 

Morristown, 28 March, 1782. 

Gentlemen, 

I have had intimations, that, under the idea of the 
cessation of hostilities within certain limits, a number 
of people intend to come over from New York to our 
hues. To prevent all intercourse of this kind is the 
principal design of this letter. Sir William Howe, on a 
former occasion, proposed that a neutrality should take 
place to a certain distance from the spot where our 
commissioners were to assemble, in order that they 
might not meet with any interruption in the transaction of their business, from the hostilities and alarms, 
which might otherwise have happened in the neighbourhood. It was upon this principle, and for this reason, 
that the present proposal was made on my part; nor 
was it indeed, nor could it be construed, to extend any 
farther. 

It is therefore my particular desire, that no persons 
coming from the enemy be permitted to land, except 
the commissioners and those immediately connected 
with them. And, as I think it expedient, not only to 
prevent new channels of communication with the enemy 
from being opened, but as far as practicable to shut the 
former, I could wish you would take the trouble to inform yourselves of the practice of scnclin<f and receiving llags on tiie lines, and point out such allenitions 
and regulations as you shall deem proper to prevent the 
evils, which have been complained of, as resulting liom 
too frequent an intercourse with the enemy. 

I have been informed by the commissary of pris<^ners, that the enemy are preparing to send out a considerable quantity of goods, under the sanction of passports granted by me for bringing out clothing and 
necessaries for the use of their prisoners. Tiiis is so 
contrary to my intention, and may be productive of such 
ill consequences, that I have sent Colonel Smith to 
explain the matter to you, and to request that you will 
examine the list, and signify what articles should be 
considered as necessaries, and what quantity ought to 
be permitted to be sent out. Mr. Skinner is directed 
to give you the necessary information. He will also 
expliiin to you the mode, which has prevailed, of making partial exchanges. This subject I need not recommend particularly, as it is comprehended within the limits of your commission. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Instructions. 

Sir, 

The spirit of enterprise, so conspicuous in your plan 
for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the 
Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby, merits applause ; and you have my authority to make the attempt, in any manner, and at such a time, as your own 
judgment shall direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is 
unnecessary to caution you against ofl'ering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince and Admiral, should 
you be so fortunate as to capture them ; but it may not 
be amiss to press the propriety of a proper line of conduct upon the party you command. 

In case of success, you will, as soon as you get them 
to a place of safety, treat them with all possible respect; 
but you are to delay no time in conveying them to 
Congress, and reporting your proceedings with a copy 
of these orders. Take care not to touch upon the 
ground, which is agreed to be neutral, namely, from 
Newark to Rahway and four miles back. Given at 
Head-Quarters, this 28th day of March, 1782.

Gentlemen, 

I have been favored with your letter of the 16th of 
April by General Forman. Convinced from the state of 
facts, which has been exliibited to me, that justice, expediency, and necessity requii-e, that satisfaction should 
be obtained for the murder of Captain Huddy, I have 
in the first instance made a representation to Sir Henry 
Clinton and demanded, that the officer, who commanded the party, or, if he was not a captain, such a number of agents in the execution, as are equal by tariflf 
to that rank, should be delivered up to condign punishment. In case of refusal, I have formed the resolution, that retaliation shall take place upon a British 
officer of equal rank. It therefore remains with the 
enemy alone to prevent this distressing alternative ; 
for, having formed my opinion upon the most mature 
reflection and deliberation, I can never recede from it. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 

The enclosed representation from the inhabitants of 
the county of Monmouth, with testimonials to the facts, 
which can be corroborated by other unquestionable 
evidence, will bring before your Excellency the most 
wanton, unprecedented, and inhuman murder, that ever 
disgraced the arms of a civilized people. 

I shall not, because I believe it to be altogether unnecessary, trouhle your E.xcclluncy witli any animadversions ujion this transaction. Candor obliges me to 
be explicit. To save the innocent, I demand the guilty. 
Captain Lippencot, therefore, or the ollicer who commaiuled at the execution of Captain Huddy, must be 
given up ; or, if that otricer was of inferior rank to 
him, so many of the perpetrators as will, according to 
the tarirt' of exchange, be an equivalent. To do this, 
will mark the justice of your Excellency's character. 
In failure of it, I shall hold myself justifiable, in the 
eyes of God and man, for the measure to which I shall 
resort. 

I beg your Excellency to be persuaded, that it cannot be more disagreeable to you to be addressed in 
this language, than it is to me to offer it ; hut the subject requires frankness and decision. I have to request 
your speedy determination, as my resolution is suspended but for your answer. I am, Sir, &lc.

TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Newburg, 22 April, 1782. 

Dear Sir,
 
I have received, since my arrival at these quarters, 
your favor of the 12th of February, respecting the exchange of your honorable father for Lord Cornwallis. 
I am sorry to inform you, that, upon my arrival at 
Philadelphia, and for a long time after I had been there, 
I experienced the greatest disinclination in Congress to the exchange of Lord Cornwallis upon any terms ; 
and that it was not till after I had combated their objections in different ways, and at several meetings of 
their commhtees, that I got the matter placed upon such 
a footing, as to leave me at liberty to negotiate the exchange of that officer at any rate. The principal difficulties are now so far removed, as to admit commissioners on each side to meet, and they are now sitting 
at Elizabeth town for the purpose of exchanges (in 
which Mr. Laurens's is particularly given in charge), 
and for settling of accounts ; and I hope, unless some 
untoward impediment should intervene in the prosecution of this business, that you will soon meet the accomplishment of your wishes. 

It has been my uniform opinion since the capitulation 
of Yorktown, that, unless the enemy can send such 
reinforcements to this continent, as will in their judgment place their two principal posts of New York and 
Charleston in a state of perfect security, or unless they 
are sure of having a naval superiority on this coast 
during the operations of the campaign, they will concentrate their force at one of those points ; and further 
it has as invariably been my opinion, that New York 
will be the last hold they will quit in the United States. 
If I am mistaken in the first, I shall beUeve, that a negotiation of peace or a truce is near at hand, and, that 
they hazard much for the uti possidetis, which, from 
present appearances, and my conception of the views 
of the British government, I have not the smallest idea 
of; I mean peace this year. 

With the greatest truth and sincerity, 
I am, dear Sir, 
your most affectionate servant.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Newburg, 23 April, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

Your apprehensions, in consequence of the movement of the legion of Lau/un, need not be much alarmed ; the present situation of the enemy in New York, I 
am persuaded, will not aflbrd any reinforcements to 
your quarter. 

The i-ecruits raising in the States, from which your 
army is drawn, are completing as far as cii-cumstances 
will admit, and, if needed, will be ready to go to you 
as early as the operations of the campaign are decided ; 
which, at present, from a variety of circumstances, 
among which a want of intelligence from Europe is not 
the least, are held in uncertainty. The State of INIaryland had some time ago about three hundred men enlisted, and waiting only for their clothes, which have 
been sent on from Philadelphia. A number also is 
collected in Pennsylvania. But, until our information 
respecting the enemy's intentions, and their future mode 
of war, is more clearly ascertained, as well as our 
knowledge of the support and assistance, which we 
expect from our ally, it may not be well to hasten on 
the recruits to your army. You are not insensible of 
the disadvantages we have ever experienced in attempts to reinforce at your distance by land ; it having 
hitherto proved a weakening of the main army, without 
any essential augmentation to yours. 

In present circumstances, without the aid of naval 
forces and water conveyance, your own experience and 
the general knowledge you have of the country will 
readily decide upon the impracticability of transporting 
by land such heavy stores and artillery, as would be 
necessary for great operations. So that you have only to content yourself with such a force as will be competent to the purpose of confining the enemy to their 
lines, and prevent them from carrying their ravages into 
the country. I wait with impatience for intelligence, 
which will decide the intentions of the enemy, and fix 
the operations of the campaign on our part. This, I 
hope, is not far distant. I am, &c.

I have had the honor to receive your Excellency's

the Count means to offer to the consideration of Congress, appears to be pi-qjected on a liberal scale, and,

well worthy of their attention. This gentleman is fully 
possessed of my sentiments on the subject of his proposals, and is at liberty to make such use of them as 
he thinks proper. He will have the honor of communicating them to your Excellency, and of informing you, 
that, as they involve political as well as military considerations, I have confined my opinion to the latter 
parts of the plan. I shall take an early occasion to 
address you on the subject of your letter. In the mean

and with much personal attachment,

TO COUNT DE BIENIEWSKY. 

Nowburg, 27 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

At your request, and in consequence of a letter from 
the Chevalier de la Luzerne, I have given to the plan, 
which you propose to present to Congress, all the consideration I am capable of, and beg leave to observe 
thereupon, that the utility of your plan for introducing 
a legionary corps of Germans into the service of the 
United States of America depends, in my opinion, upon 
the political state of allairs in Europe, the probability 
of the war's continuing, and the mode of conducting it ; 
as also upon the time, which will be required to bring 
this corps into action. 

Of the first, I have not the means of judging, but 
I think the second is not so problematical, as to induce 
Congress to reject a contract, which, with some alterations, imd a surety of receiving the men in twelve 
months from this date, may be attended with considerable advantages. 

Political considerations must, no doubt, have their influence in determining upon a plan of this nature and 
magnitude ; and there may be an impropriety in my 
hazarding an opinion too pointedly on the policy of it ; 
but, at your request, and at the desire of the minister 
of France, I shall oiler my sentiments on the several 
articles in the order, in which they stand in the plan before me. With much esteem and regard, I am. Sir, &c.

TO GOVERNOR GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 27 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

Though it is by no means my opinion, that the 
enemy will divide their force and again take possession of Rhode Island, there are some circumstances, 
which seem to carry such an appearance. I therefore 
think it would be highly imprudent, on our part, to leave 
any fortifications standing on the Island of Rhode Island, 
vvliich may be of use to them in such an event. The 
works round Newport can, under no circumstances, be 
of any advantage to us, and I must therefore request 
your Excellency to cause them to be levelled immediately. 

I am not well enough acquainted with the situation 
and nature of the work on Butts's Hill, to determine 
positively whether it ought to be destroyed or not. It 
appears to me, that, in case the enemy should reoccupy 
the island, it would be important for us to have possession of that ground; but whether, in such an event, 
possession could be kept, your Excellency must determine. I have no troops to spare to garrison it. If the 
work is tenable, might not a small guard be kept in it, 
and such arrangements be made, that, at the first signal 
of the appearance of a fleet, a number of militia might 
be thrown in sufficient to keep possession of it ? Should 
you think this impracticable, I would wish the works to 
be destroyed. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THE SECIIKTAUY AT WAR. 

Newburg, 27 April, 1762. 

Dear Sir, 

Finding the commissioners appointed to licjiiidate the 
accounts of moneys due for the maintenance of prisoners, and make permanent provision for their future 
support, have sepi^ated without accomplishing any tiling, 
1 think it highly expedient, that measures should be 
adopted, at this moment, for taking the German prisoners of war into our service. As this measure has been 
considerably agitated, I shall not amplify upon the justice and propriety of it, which to me seem very obvious. 
I am equally well persuaded of the policy there will be 
in augmenting every company with at least ten of these 
men, or more if they can be obtained ; for I am 
convinced, that, by such an uacorporation, they will 
make exceedingly cheap and valuable recruits, and, being able-bodied and disciplined men, they will give a 
strength and solidity to our regiments, which they will 
not otherwise acquire this campaign. All my accounts 
respecting the recruiting service are unfavorable ; indeed, not a single recruit has arrived, to my knowledge, 
from any State except Rhode Island, in consequence 
of the requisitions of Congress in December last. 

Should the plan be adopted by Congress, the sooner it is carried into execution the better. In that case, I 
think the men ought to be recruited for the continent, and not carried to the credit of the quotas of the State 
with whose lines they are to serve. For, without making any alteration in the establishment, they may be 
annexed to the regiments in such a manner, that they 
can be formed into distinct corps whenever their fidelity 
and attachment shall be sufficiently evinced, if circumstances should then require it. All the matters of 
bounty and encouragement being arranged with the 
financier, and the particulars of the scheme adjusted, 
as soon as provision shall be made for their subsistence 
on the journey, I would detach a captain and subaltern 
from every regiment, to receive and conduct them to 
the army, so that they may certainly join the respective 
regiments, at farthest, by the 1st of June. In the interim, I would beg leave to propose, lest the enemy 
should attempt to counteract the design, that the business should be kept secret, undl it is ripe for execution ; 
and then be negotiated by some gendemen of address 
appointed for the purpose. I request an answer as 
speedily as possible. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

Newburg, 28 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

I receive with much gratitude the remembrance and 
comphments of the principal officers of the French 
army in Virginia, and thank your Excellency for the 
trouble of being the bearer of them to me, and of the 
letter from Count de Rochambeau. 

With equal sensibility and pleasm-e I received the 
communications from your court, and now acknowledge 
my obligations to your Excellency for them. Though 
not decisive, they are nevertheless important. The late 
instance of their generous aid, hinted at by your ExcelleiK-y and particiiliu-ized by Mr. IMorris, is one among 
a variety of important considerations, which ought to 
bind America to France in bonds of indelible Iriendsliip and gratitude, never, I iio[)o, to be sundered. Induced by that entire conlidencc, which I repose in 
your Excellency, and a lull conviction that a nation, 
which combines her force with ours for purposes of 
all others most interesting to humanity, ought not to be 
deficient in any information I can give to ailapt objects to means, that an accordance of them may be inseparable, I shall without hesitation exhibit to you our 
present force, and my ideas of the increase of it by 
recruits, according to the best view of it which lies before me. 

It can scarcely be necessary to inform your Excellency, that our military establishment for the present 
year consists of four regiments of artillery, four legionary and two partisan corps, and fifty regiments of infantry, besides the corps of invalids ; or that Congress 
have called in pointed terms upon each State to complete its regiments to the establishment, the aggregate 
of which, if complied with, would amount to thirty-four 
thousand three hundred and eight men, exclusive of 
commissioned officers, sergeants, and music, Hazen's 
regiment, and the corps of invalids. Of this force, one 
legiomrv corps, two regiments of artillery, and twentytwo of infantry, besides Ilazen's regiment and the invalids, compose the northern army. But as Hazen's regiment is fostered by no State, discouraged from recruiting by all, and without funds, it must soon dwindle to nothing, being now very weak. 

The present totality of the rank and file, exclusive 
of sergeants, of the regiments composing the northern army, amounts to nine thousand one hundred and 
forty-six. From this number the sick, men in different 
branches of the staff department, and such as are employed on other extra duties, whom the pecuUarity of 
our circumstances compels me to furnish from the army, being deducted, will reduce the efficient operating 
force of these corps to seven thousand five hundred 
and fifty-three rank and file ; and I should be uncandid 
if I were not to acknowledge, that I do not expect it 
will be increased by recruits in the course of the campaign to more than ten thousand fit for duty in the 
field. This, Sir, in my opinion, will be the full amount 
of the established regiments of the States east of 
Pennsylvania. To ascertain the number of militia, 
which may be assembled for occasional offensive operations, is more than I can do. The general opinion 
is, that there will be no want of militia for any enterprise we can have in view. Be this as it may, this 
one thing is certain, that militia are not only slow in 
their movements, but, undertaking to judge also of the 
propriety of them, will wait till the necessity for acting 
strikes them; which, in most cases, is as injurious to 
the service as inability or want of inclination ; disappointment being the consequence of delay. This observation I could not refrain from making, because, in 
all combined operations, especially those which may 
depend upon the season or a limited period for their 
execution, it is of the utmost importance to know the 
fact. 

The enclosed return, which is a copy of the last state of the force under the orders of Mujor-Gcaeral Greene 
that has come to my hands, will give your Excellency 
every information in my power respecting the state 
and condition of that ai-my ; which was to be augmented by the partisan corps of Colonel Armand, consisting of about two hundred horse and foot. Independently of those, theie are two small legiments at 
Fort Pitt, one from the State of Pennsylvania, the other 
from Virginia, which are included in the general estabhshmcnt of the army ; but no partirular return is here 
given of them. 

What measures are adopted by the States of Georgia and North and South Carolina to recruit their battalions, I know not. Virginia marched about four hundred men near the end of February for the southern 
army, and, by an act of the legislature passed at their 
last session, resolved to raise more ; but in what forwardness they are, or what is to be expected from the 
act, I am equally uninformed. Maryland and Pennsylvania depend upon voluntary enlistments, and are proceeding very slowly in the business of recruiting, especially the latter. It is impossible for me, therefore, 
to say to what number that army will be increased. 

This, Sir, is an accurate state of the force we have 
at present, and my expectation of what it may be, independent of militia. 

The enemy's force, from the best information I have 
been able to obtain of it, may stand thus. At New 
York, regulars, including their established corps of provincials, rank and file, nine thousand ; militia of the city, 
refugees, and independent companies, four thousand ; 
(sailors and marines, according to the number of ships, 
which may be in the harbour, and, this being uncertain, 
no number is given ;) at Charleston about three thousand three hundred ; at Savannah about seven hundred. 
In Canada, including British, German, and established 
provincials, five thousand ; at Penobscot about five hundred ; at Halifax and its dependencies, uncertain, say 
three thousand five hundred ; in all, twenty- six thousand. 

The above estimate, so far as it respects New York, 
Charleston, and Savannah, is I beUeve to be depended 
upon. The force in Canada by some accounts is more, 
by others less, than five thousand. The regular British 
and German troops in that country cannot exceed four 
thousand ; but, in addition to these, are the corps of 
Sir John Johnson and others, which I am told have 
been considerably increased by the disaffected of this 
and other States, who have fled to Canada. But it is 
to be observed, that this force, be it what it may, is 
employed in the occupation of posts between Quebec 
and Michilimackinac, and on Lake Champlain, through 
an extent of not less than seven or eight hundred 
miles, and that all these posts are dependent upon the 
first for provision and supplies of every kind. I am 
less certain of the enemy's force in Nova Scotia than 
elsewhere. The number here given is not from recent intelligence, and may be erroneous, as their garrisons are w^eakened or strengthened according to circumstances. Cumberland, Windsor, Annapolis, and St. 
John's River are posts dependent upon Halifax, and 
included in the three thousand five hundred men here 
mentioned. 

If this state of matters be satisfactory to you, or 
useful in the formation of any plans against the common enemy, I shall be very ha]5py in having given it. 

Permit me now. Sir, to express the high sense I 
have of the honor you have done me in communicating the favorable opinion entertained of my conduct 
by the coui-t and nation of France, and to acknowledge my obligation to those oflicers, who have inspired these sentiments. To stand well in the eyes 
ol" a nation, which I view as one of the lirst in the 
world, and in the opinion of a monarch, whom I consider as the supporter of the rights of humanity, and 
to whom I am personally indebted for the command 
he has been pleased to honor me with, is highly llattering to my vanity, at the same time it has a first 
claim to all my gratitude. It is unnecessary, I hope, 
to add fresh assurances of the respect and esteem, 
with which I have the honor to be, &,c.

an ample account of your proceedings in consequence 
of the commission you were charged with by me. I 
have also received from Sir Henry Clmton an abstract 
of the same negotiations, as stated by his commissioners. From the whole aspect of the matter, I have litde doubt, that the reasons you mention, as the operating principles with the enemy, have been the real

to their decision the subject of future exchanges ; not 
less lamenting the unreasonableness of our enemies, 
than regretting the miseries of war, which may be augmented and protracted by such unreasonable conduct. 
I should do injustice to my own feelings on this occasion, if I did not express something beyond my bare 
approbation of the attention, address, and abihty exhibited by you, Gendemen, in the course of this tedious and fruitless negotiation. The want of having

wisdom of Congress, and have only to beg for my 
own direction, that I may be early informed of their

which has been formerly adopted for that purpose. I 
beg leave to point the attention of Congress particularly to that part of the commissioners' letter to me, 
which mentions the extension of a p;u-don to the refugees in the service of the enemy. Their ideas on this subject are so perfectly consonant to my own, ibmied 
on the principles of policy and expediency, that I cannot omit to notice it, and to submit to the consideration of Congress, whether the adopting of this measure under proper restrictions may not be attended wilh 
happy consequences to our cause, and be equally productive of ruin and confusion to the British interest in 
America. Lamenting that the benevolence of my intentions has been so totally defeated, by the unhappy

TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL HAZEN. 

Head-Quarters, 3 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

The enemy, persisting in that barbarous line of conduct, which they have pursued during the course of 
this war, have lately most inhumanly executed Captain Joshua Huddy, of the Jersey State troops, taken prisoner by them at a post on Tom's River ; and in consequence I have written to the British Commanderin-chief, that, unless the perpetrators of that horrid 
deed were dehvered up, I should be under the disagreeable necessity of retaliating, as the only means left 
to put a stop to such inhuman proceedings. 

You will, therefore, immediately on receipt of this, 
designate by lot for the above purpose a British captain, who is an unconditional prisoner, if such a one is 
in your possession ; if not, a lieutenant under the same 
circumstances from among the prisoners at any of the 
posts, either in Pennsylvania or Maryland. So soon 
as you have fixed on the person, you will send him 
under a safeguard to Philadelphia, where the minister of war will order a proper guard to receive and conduct him to the place of liis destination. 

For your intbrniation respeciing the ollicers, who are 
prisoners in our possession, I have ordered tiie commissary of prisoners tt) fiirnisii you with a list of them. 
It will be forwarded with this. I need not mention to 
you, that every possible tenderness, that is consistent 
with the security of him, should be shown to the person whose unfortunate lut ii may be to sulFer.

TO LIEUTE>A>'T-GEXKUAL JAMES UOBEKTSON. 

Head-Quarters, 4 May, 1762. 

Sir, 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 
Ist instant. Your Excellency is acquainted with the 
determination expressed in my letter of the 21st of 
April to Sir Henry Clinton. I have now to inform you, 
that, so far from receding from that resolution, orders 
are given to designate a British officer for retaliation. 
The time and p'.;ce are fixed ; but I still hope the result of your couii-martial will prevent this dreadful alternative. 

Sincerely lamenting the cruel necessity, which alone 
can induce so distressing a measure in the present instance, I do assure your Excellency, that I am as 
earnestly desirous as you can be, that the war may be carried on agreeably to the rules, which humanity formed, and the example of the politest nations recommends, and shall be extremely happy in agreeing with 
you to prevent or punish every breach of the rules of 
war within the spheres of our respective commands. 

I am unacquainted with the circumstances of the detention of Badgely and Hatfield. The matter shall be 
exammed into and justice done ; but I must inform you, 
that in my opinion deserters, or characters, who for the 
crimes they have committed are amenable to the civil 
pov.'er, cannot on either side be protected under the 
sanction of a flag. I do not pretend to say, that the 
abovementioned persons are in that predicament. 

Recrimination would be useless. I forbear, therefore, 
to mendon numerous instances, which have stained the 
reputation of your arms, marked the progress of this 
war with unusual severity, and disgraced the honor of 
human nature itself. While I wave this ungrateful discussion, I repeat the assertion, that it is my most ardent desire, not only to soften the inevitable calamides 
of war, but even to introduce on every occasion as 
great a share of tenderness and humanity, as can possibly be exercised in a state of hostility. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Newburg, 4 May, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

By the letter to Brigadier-General Hazen, which I have enclosed to you under a flying seal for your inspection, you will observe the distressing alternative to which we are at last reduced. I must request you will 
give that letter a safe and speedy conveyance. 

As soon as the British officer, whose unfortunate lot 
it is to be desij^natcd as the object of retaliation, shall 
arrive in Fliihulel[)hia, it will be necessary to have a 
suflicient escort, under the command of a very discreet and vigilant ollicer, in readiness to receive and 
conduct him to the cantonment of the New Jersey 
troops. I pray you will be pleased to give the orders 
proper for the occasion, and direct the officer commanding the party to apply to the commandant of the 
Jersey line, who will have final instructions respecting 
the matter. 

Keenly wounded as my feelings will be, at the deplorable destiny of the unhappy victim, no gleam of 
hope can arise to him but fiom the conduct of the 
enemy themselves. This he may be permitted to 
communicate to the British Commander-in-chief, in 
whose power alone it rests to avert the impending 
vengeance from the innocent by executing it on the 
guilty. At the same time it may be announced, that 
I will receive no application nor answer any letter on 
the subject, which does not inform me that ample satisfaction is made for the death of Captain Huddy on 
the perpetrators of that horrid deed. 

I have the honor to be, «Slc.

TO MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Circular to the States. 

Head-Quarters, 4 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

I find myself arrived at that period, at which I hoped 
to have seen the battalions of the several States completed to their establishment, in conformity to the requisitions of Congress of the 19th of December last. 

The enclosed retui-ns of recruits, which I have caused to be made up to the 1st instant, will show how 
totally short of my expectations the exertions of the 
States have fallen. From your State you will find that 
only recruits have joined the army in consequence of the above requisition. 

All my accounts from Europe concur in declaring, 
that the British King and ministers are still determined 
to prosecute the war. It becomes, therefore, our decided duty to be prepared to meet these hostile intentions, in whatever way they are to be can-ied into 
execution ; to do which, our utmost exertions are now 
called for. You ■will suffer me therefore to entreat, 
that, if your State has any expectation from the military operations of this season, not another moment may 
be lost in providing for and carrying into most effectual execution the full completion of its battalions. It 
is scarcely necessary to inform you, that on this expectation all our calculations must be formed, and on 
this event must rest the hopes of the ensuing campaign. 

My intelligence of the actual aid we may expect 
from our allies is not yet so explicit as to lead me to 
decide absolutely on the mode of operations for this 
campaign ; but w^ere our expectations of support from 
that quarter ever so promising, yet, from the negligence 
and languor of the States, from whence our own exertions are to spring, I am not at this day enabled to 
give any assurance of our being prepared to cooperate 
with our allies in any great objects equal to their expectations or our own ability. I am sorry to acquaint 
your Excellency, that I have the best authority to assure 
you, that the court of France is much dissatisfied with 
this want of vigor and exertion in tlic Slates, and with 
that dispusition, which apiicar-s willing at least, il' nut 
desirous, to cast all the burthen of the American war 
upon them. Waving the injustice and impolicy of such 
a temper, which to me appear very conspicuous, how 
humiliating is the idea, that our dependence for support 
should rest on others, beyond the point which absolute necessity dictates; hew discouraging to our allies, 
and how dishonorable to ourselves must be our want 
of vigor and utmost exertion, at a time when, if we 
are not wanting to ourselves, our prospects are the fairest that our wishes could extend to. 

I find from the proceedings of the several States, 
that their calculation of dehciencies, formed on application to the several towns, which furnish the men, are 
greatly different from the returns sent from the army. 
I forbear mentioning many reasons, which might be assigned to produce this diHerence, and which in my 
opinion originate principally within the States, and will 
content myself with this one observation, that, should 
the States deceive themselves in this respect, and fail 
to furnish the expected force in the field, they will not 
only cast an essential injury upon the army, but the 
unhappy consequences of a tailure in their expectations from a military operation will return upon themselves, whilst recrimination can have no effect towards 
alleviating our protracted misfortunes and distress. 

Although money matters are not within the line of 
my duty, yet, as they are so intimately connected with 
all military operations ; and being lately informed by the 
financier in answer to some small requisitions upon 
him, that he has not yet received one penny in money 
from any one State, upon the requisition of Congress 
for the eight millions of dollars, but that, on the contrary, some of the States are devising ways to draw 
from him the small sums he has been able otherwise 
to establish, and that he is at this time barely able to 
feed the army, and that from hand to mouth ; I cannot 
forbear to express my apprehensions from that quarter, and to urge, with the warmth of zeal and earnestness, the most pointed and effectual attention of your 
State to the actual raising and collecting of its proportion of the requisition. Upon the present plan of noncompHance with requisitions for men and supplies, let 
me seriously ask your Excellency, How is it possible for 
us to continue the war ? How is it possible to support 
an army in money or recruits ? To what a wretched 
state must we soon be reduced? How dangerous is it 
to suffer our affairs to run at hazard, and to depend 
upon contingencies ? To what do the present measures 
tend, but to the utter ruin of that cause, which we 
have hitherto so long and nobly supported, and to 
crush all the fair hopes, which the present moment 
places before us, were we only to exert the power and 
abilities with which Providence has bountifully blessed 
this country ? But if the States will not impose, or do 
not collect and apply, taxes for support of the war, the 
sooner we make terms the better ; the longer we continue a feeble and ineffectual war, the greater will be 
our distress at the houi- of submission. For my own 
part, I am fully convinced, that, without the means of 
execution, no officer, whoever he may be, who is 
placed at the head of the military department, can be 
answerable for the success of any plans he may propose or agree to. 

Upon this subject I will only add, that, from past 
experience and from present prospects, I am persuaded, 
that, if the States would furnish the supplies agreeably 
to the late requisition, and would suffer the pay, clothing, and subsistence of the army to go through one common channel, two tliirtls of their former expenses 
would be saved ; and many partialities, discontents, and 
jealousies, which now subsist, would be removed and 
cease, and an establishment of order, regularity, and 
harmony in our general affairs would be experienced, which cannot arise from the present disjointed and different systems of finance adopted by separate States. 

While acting in my milittuy capacity, I am sensible 
of the impropriety of stepping into the line of civil 
polity. INIy anxiety for the general good, and an earnest desire to bring this long protracted war to a happy issue, when I hope to retire to that peaceful state 
of domestic pleasures,, from which the call of my country has brought me to take an active part, and to 
which I most ardently wish a speedy return, I trust 
will furnish my excuse with your Excellency and the 
legislature, while I request your pardon for this trespass. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Head-Quarters, 5 May, 1782. 

SlK, 

If the enemy ever had any intention to evacuate Charleston, that idea, I believe, is now given up. Great revolutions in the British councils have lately taken 
place. The particulars, brought by the March packet, will be conveyed to you in the enclosed New York Gazette, which I send for your perusal. General Robertson, who has for sonic time past been governor or 
New York, is lately appointed commander-in-chief in 
America. This information I have from his own letter. 

Port Mahon, and the whole isliind of Minorca, are 
certainly surremlcred to his Catholic Majesty's arms. 
This event is deckued in New York ; but I am possessed of but few particulars concerning the capitulation. My most cordial congratulations attend your Excellency, and the ollicers of your army, upon the favors, 
which you inform me have, with so much justice, been 
conferred by his Most Christian Majesty. Be assured, Sir, I shall ever feel a most hvely interest and 
pleasure in every event, which bestows honor or emolument on such deserving characters. The favorable 
mention, which the King is pleased to make of me, 
demands my warmest and most particular acknowledgments. This honor done me will form an additional 
tie to the gratitude, which already binds me to the 
person and interests of his Majesty. 

Convinced that the works at Newport would be of 
no use to us, and that they might be of infinite importance to the enemy, should they have an intention 
to establish a post there, from a bare apprehension of 
such an event I iiavc requested the governor of Rhode 
Island to have them levelled ; pointing him at the same 
time to the necessity of preserving Butts's Hill, if possible. The plans for the campaign depending entirely 
upon the succours, which will be sent by his Most 
Christian Majesty, I can do nothing more than form 
opinions upon certain hypotheses. If we should have a 
naval superiority, and a Wnxe suHicient to attempt New 
York, and you have not secure means of transporting your troops by water, for their greater ease, to the Head 
of Elk, the route you propose for their march by land 
is, I am persuaded, the best that can be. It is to be 
feared, that the manoeuvre your Excellency suggests 
will hardly have its intended effect, as it will be performed in so short a space, as to give no time for its 
operation, before the deception you propose would be 
disclosed. 

If your march should take place before our intended 
interview, the time of its commencement must be determined absolutely by your Excellency, in consequence 
of the advice you may receive from your court, and of 
knowing the time at which the succours may be expected on this coast. To delay it beyond this point 
would waste the campaign ; and to commence at an 
earlier period Avould disclose our plans and prepare 
the enemy for an approach. Every attention, consistent with my means, has been bestowed on the boats, 
and I hope to be tolerably provided with them. 

I shall, by this opportunity, communicate your request 
for militia to Governor Harrison. I persuade myself, 
that, knowing how expensive the militia are, and with 
what difficulty they are drawn out, you will be as 
moderate as possible in your requisition, and, that you 
will leave nothing, when it can well be avoided, to 
their protection. I am, &c.

TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Head-Quarters, 6 Hay, 1782. 

Sir, 

On receiving information, by a representation from 
the inhabitants of IMonmouth county, of the cruel mur- diT of Captain Joshua HinKly, ol the Jersey State 
troops, by a party of refugees from New York, I inimediately informed the British commander-in-chief, 
that, unless he delivered up the perpetrators of that 
horrid deed, I should he reduced to die disagreeable 
necessity of retaliating. 

In answer to my letter the British general informs 
me, that a court-martial is ordered for the trial of the 
persons complained of; but at the same time says, that 
those people ofl'er, in justification of the fact, a number 
of instances of cruelty committed by us, and particularly 
in Monmouth county. Though this is by no means 
admitted, but on the contrary orders are given to designate and send to camp a British olliccr, who, if my demand is not complied witii, will be executed ; yet I 
cannot forbear observing to your Excellency, that, whilst 
I demand satisfaction from the enemy for the violences 
they commit, it becomes us to be particularly careful, 
that they have not a like claim on us ; and I must beg 
you to make it known to all persons acting in a militarycapacity in your State, that I shall hold myself obliged 
to deliver up to the enemy, or otherwise to punish, 
such of them as shall commit any act, which is in the 
least contrary to the laws of war. I doubt not of your 
doing the same with those, who come under the civil 
power. 

The enemy also complain of the detention of Hatfield and Badgely, who, they say, were out by direction of our commissaiy of prisoners under sanction of 
a flag. I must beg your Excellency to inform me, as 
soon as possible, of the circumstances attending their 
capture, and the causes of their detention. If those 
causes are not strictly just, I could wish they were 
sent in. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Head-Quarters, 8 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to receive your Excellency's favor 
of the 24th of April, enclosing a copy of your letter to 
Congress on the subject of American prisoners confined in England, with your sentiments on the necessity 
of retaliation. 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that a meeting of commissioners, which had among other matters 
been concerted for the purposes of a general exchange, 
comprehending a release of our countrymen prisoners 
in Europe, as well as others, has unhappily been dissolved, without effecting any one of those benevolent 
purposes, which were the object, on our part, of their 
mission. This circumstance, I fear, will be a means 
of placing any future exchanges at a great distance. 
No measure, however, in my power shall be omitted to 
effect so desirable an event. 

I have the honor to concur in sentiment with your 
Excellency on the subject of retaliation, and to inform 
you, that the circumstances attending the death of Captain Huddy are likely to bring that matter to a point. 
A demand has been made by me for the principal 
perpetrators of that horrid deed. The reply to this 
demand, received from General Robertson, is not satisfactory. I have therefore informed him, that orders are 
given to designate by lot a British officer of the rank 
of Captain Huddy for retaliation ; that the time and 
place for his execution are fixed ; and that nothing can 
stay my resolution from being carried into complete 
effect, but a strict compliance with my first requisition. 
General Robertson's answer will bring this ungrateful 
business to an issue. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO TIIK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 10 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
the enclosed papers. They contain a continuance of 
the correspondence, whicii has been produced between 
me, General Robertson, and Sir Henry Clinton, in the 
case of Captain IKuIdy. That from Sir Henry did 
not come to hand till some days after the receipt 
of General Robertson's letter, and after my reply to 
tlic laUrr. I am in daily expectation of an answer from 
General Robertson, which I hope will bring this ungrateful business to a conclusion. 

I take this opportunity to convey to Congress sundry 
English and New York newspapers, which have within 
a few days past been put into my hands. Their contents are new and interesting, and I talie the earliest 
occasion to present them to Congress. 

Although I view the debates, so far as they import 
proposals of pacification to America, to be idle and delusory, yet I cannot Imt express my fears for the effect 
they may have upon the exertions of the States, which 
are already too feeble and void of energy. The people, 
so far as I am informed, are catching at the idea of 
peace with great eagerness ; and the industry which 
the enemy are using for its propagation is to me a very 
suspicious circumstance. For my own part, I view 
our situation such, that, instead of relaxing, we ought to 
improve the present moment as the most favorable to 
our wishes. The British nation appear to me to be 
staggered and almost ready to sink beneath the accumulating weight of debt and misfortune. If we follow 
the blow with vigor and energy, I think the game is our own. 

Just as I was closing these despatches, I received a 
letter from Sir Guy Carleton, covering sundry printed 
papers, a copy of which, with the papers, I have now 
the honor to enclose to your Excellency, with the copy 
of my answer to him ; and I flatter myself, that my 
conduct therein will be agreeable to the wishes of Congress. I have the honor to be, &c.

I luid the honor last evening to receive your Excellency's letter of the 7tli, with the several papers enclosed. Ever since the commencement of tliis unnatural war, my conduct has borne invariable testimony 
against those inhuman excesses, which, in too many 
instances, have marked its various progress. With respect to a late transaction, to which I presume your 
Excellency alludes, I have already expressed my resolution, a resolution formed on the most mature deliberation, and from which I shall not recede. I have to 
inform your Excellency, that your request of a passport for Mr. Morgann, to go to Philadelphia, shall be 
conveyed to Congress by the earUest opportunity ; and 
I will embrace the first moment, that I shall have it in 
my power, to communicate to you their determination 
thereon. 

Many inconveniences and disorders having arisen 
from an improper admission of flags at various posts of 
the two armies, which have given rise to complaints on 
both sides ; to prevent abuses in future, and for the 
convenience of communication, I have concluded to receive all flags, from within your lines, at the post of 
Dobbs's Ferry, and nowhere else, so long as the headquarters of the two armies remain as at present.

A variety of circumstances at this time conspire to 
prevent an ultimate decision upon the operations of 
the campaign. Before this can reach you, a total 
change of men and measures, whicli has taken place 
in Great Britain, will be announced to you. What 
will be the consequences of this revolution, cannot 
with certainty be declared. Alreaily Sir Guy Carleton 
has arrived at New York, charged, as he says, with 
a commission of peace, in conjunction with Admiral 
Digby. His terms of conciliation, which have been 
sent to me, bear the aspect of those brought by former commissioners, in the year 1780, merely ostensible 
and delusory. 

As soon as our phin of operations is fixed, which I 
hope will soon be done, you will be informed of every 
measure necessary to be communicated to you. In the 
mean time I forbear entering into any particular detail. 
General St. Clair is not arrived at my camp. I shall 
defer making any reply to your proposed regulations 
of the array till I have seen him. I am very glad to 
hear of the safe arrival of Mrs. Greene at your quarters, 
and most sincerely give you joy of the event. Mrs. 
Washington joins me in cordial compliments to JMrs. 
Greene, and hearty good wishes for her and your 
health and happiness.

Dauphin of France has been formally announced to 
Congress by the minister of France. Its celebration 
has been observed in Philadelphia, and is directed to be 
noticed in the army with such demonstrations of joy as 
aie tliought proper for the occasion. This will be done here, and I now make the communication to you, that 
the officers of your army may take an opportunity to participate in the general joy. I am, &c.

Sir, 

~With a mixture of great surprise and astonishment, 
I have read with attention the sentiments you have 
submitted to my perusal. Be assured, Sir, no occurrence in the course of the war has given me 
more painful sensations, than your information of there 
being such ideas existing in the army, as you have 
expressed, and I must view with abhorrence and reprehend with severity. For the present the communication of them will rest in my own bosom, unless some 
further agitation of the matter shall make a disclosure 
necessary. 

I am much at a loss to conceive what part of my 
conduct could have given encouragement to an address, 
which to me seems big with the greatest mischiefs, 
that can befall my country. If I am not deceived in 
the knowledge of myself, you could not have found 
a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. 
At the same time, in justice to my own feelings, I must 
add, that no man possesses a more sincere wish to 
see ample justice done to the army than I do ; and, as 
far as my powers and influence, in a constitutional way, 
extend, they shall be employed to the utmost of my 
abilities to effect it, should there be any occasion. Let 
me conjure you, then, if you have any regard for your 
country, concern for yourself or posterity, or respect for 
me, to banish these thoughts from your mind, and never communicate, as from yourself or any one else, a sentiment of the like nature. I am, Sir, your most obedient servant.

I have received your favor of the 27th of May, and am much concerned to find, that Captain Asgill has been sent on, notwithstanding the information, which 
you had received, of there being two unconditional prisoners of war in our possession. I much fear, that the enemy, knowing our delicacy respecting the propriety of retaliating upon a capitulation officer in any case, and being acquainted that unconditional prisoners are within our power, will put an unfavorable construction upon this instance of our conduct. At least, under present circumstances. Captain Asgill's application to Sir Guy Carleton will, I fear, be productive of remonstrance and recrimination only, which may possibly tend to place the subject upon a disadvantageous footing might occasion further mistake and delay, Captain AsgiU 
will be detained until I can learn the certainty of Lieutenant Turner's or some other officer's answering our 
purpose ; and, as their detention will leave the young

Head-Quarters, 4 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I am just informed by the secretary at war, that Captain Asgill, of the British guards, an unfortunate officer, who is destined to be the unhappy victim to 
atone for the death of Captain Huddy, had arrived in Philadelphia, and would set off very soon for the Jersey line, the place assigned for his execution. He will 
probably arrive as soon as this will reach you, and will be attended by Captain Ludlow, his friend, whom he wishes to be permitted to go into New York, with an 
address to Sir Guy Carleton in his behalf. 

You will therefore give permission to Captain Ludlow to go by the way of Dobbs's Ferry into New York, with such representation as Captain Asgill shall please 
to make to Sir Guy Carleton. At the same time, I would wish you to intimate to the gentlemen, that, although I am deeply affected with the unhappy fate, to 
which Captain Asgill is subjected, yet, that it will be to no purpose for them to make any representation to 
Sir Guy Carleton, which may serve to draw on a discussion of the present point of retaUation ; that, in the stage to which the matter has been sullered ti) run, 
all argumentation on the subject is entirely precludeil on my part ; that my resohitions have been grounded 
on so mature deliberation, that they must remain unalterably li\ed. You will also inform the gentlemen, 
that, while my duty calls me to make this decisive determination, humanity prompts a tear for the unfortunate otlering, and inilines me to say, that I most devoutly wish his life may be saved. This happy event 
may be attained ; but it must be effected by the British Commandfr-in-chicf. lie knows the alternative, 
which will accomplish it ; imd he knows, that this alternative only can avert the dire extremity from the innocent, and that in this way alone the manes of the 
murdered Captain Huddy will be best appeased. 

In the mean time, while this is doing, I must beg 
that you will be pleased to treat Captain Asgill with 
every tender attention and politeness (consistent with 
his present situation), which his rank, fortune, and connexions, together with his unfortunate state, demand.

for retaliation, and what prospect he has of relief from 
his application to Sir Guy Carleton, which I have been 
informed he has made through his friend Captain Ludlow. I have heard nothing yet from New York in 
consequence of this application. His fate will be suspended till I can be informed of the decision of Sir Guy Carleton ; but I am impatient, lest this should be 
unreasonably delayed. The enemy ought to have 
learned before this, that my resolutions are not to be 
trilled with. I am, &lc. 

P. S. I am informed that Captain Asgill is at Chatham Avithout guard, and under no constraint. This, if 
true, is certainly wrong. I wish to have the young 
gentleman treated with all the tenderness possible, 
consistent with his present situation ; but, until his fate 
is determined, he must be considered as a close prisoner, and be kept in the greatest security. I request, 
therefore, that he be sent immediately to the Jersey

TO ARCHIBALD CARY. 

Newburg, 15 June, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

I have been honored with your favor of the 25th 
ultimo enclosing sundry resolutions of your Assembly, 
respecting the insidious manoeuvres of the enemy, who, 
it is evident, cannot mean well, because they take indirect steps to obtain that, to which a plain road is opened, and which every good man is desirous of obtaining 
upon honorable terms. I thank you, my good Sir, for 
the resolves, which you did me the honor to enclose. 
They breathe a proper spirit, and with others of a like 
kind in the different assemblies will, it is to be hoped, 
convince the enemy, that it is both their interest and 
policy to be honest. 

It gives me much pleasure to learn from so good 
authority as your pen, that the Assembly of Virginia is better composed tliiiii it lias been for several years. 
Much, I think, may bo expected iVom it ; the path we 
are to tread is certainly a plain one ; the oI)jcct is full 
in our view, but it will not come to us ; we must work 
our way to it by proper advances, and the means of 
doing this are men and money. In vain is it to expect, that our aim is to be accomplished by fond wishes 
for peace ; and equally unijcnorous as fruitless will it be 
for one State to depciul u\nm aiuiilicr to bring this to 
pass. If I may be allowed to speak figuratively, our 
asseml)li('s, in politics, are to be compared to the wheels 
of a clock in mechanics. The whole, for the general 
purposes of war, should be set in motion by the great 
wheel, Congress ; and, if all will do their parts, the machine will work easily ; but a failure in one disorders 
the whole. Without the large one, which sets the 
whole in motion, nothing can be done. It is the united 
wisdom and exertions of the whole in Congress, that 
we are to depend upon. Without this we are no better than a rope of sand, and as easily broken asunder. 
I write thus openly and freely to you, my dear Sir, 
because I pant for retirement, and am persuaded that 
an end of our warfare is not to be obtained but by 
vigorous exertions. The subjugation of America, so far 
at least as to hold it in a dependent state, is of too 
much importance for Great Britain to yield the palm to 
us whilst her resources exist, or our inactivity, want of 
system, and dependence upon other powers prevail. I 
can truly say, that the first wish of my soul is to return speedily into the bosom of that country, which 
gave me birth, and, in the sweet enjoyment of domestic 
happiness and the company of a few friends, to end 
my days in quiet, when I shall be called from this 
stage. With great truth and sincerity, I am, «Scc.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 17 June, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

When pressed by necessity to adopt a measure, a 
choice is scarcely left to us. In answer, therefore, to 
your letter of the 12th instant, I am obliged to observe, 
that the tardiness of the States will compel us to do 
that, which in my opinion policy forbids. 

At this critical moment, inclination w-ould not lead 
me to consent to disbanding any corps of the army. 
But if the States cannot, or, what is the same, will not 
recruit the regiments, which are assigned as their quotas, nor furnish the supplies necessaiy for their support, 
we must next consider what kind of troops under the 
present view of the matter can be dispensed with ; in 
doing which, I cannot hesitate to declare, that cavalry, 
in present circumstances and the probable operations 
of the campaign, will be least useful, and for that reason 
ought to be the first to be reduced. But how to effect this purpose appears difficult, the corps being very 
much dispersed, and the sentiments of the officers 
quite unknown to me. I confess I am at a loss howto point out any particular mode. To make it a matter 
of arrangement with the officers to determine among 
themselves who should go out, and who should remain 
in service, would be a work of time. To select the 
best from among the whole, is not only an invidious 
business, but requu-es a perfect knowledge of each individual character, a knowledge, which, with a few exceptions, I confess myself not possessed of. And to 
retain the corps or officers by seniority may, and I am 
sure in some instances would, give the most indifferent 
officers in the whole line of the cavalry. Not being 
able to hit on any method, which is satisfactory to myself, I submit this point to your decision. 

If the regiments of artillery, allotted to the States of 
Pennsylvania and Virginia, cannot be completed, an 
event of which I see hut little prospect, however inconsistent it may be with policy, and whatever consequence it may involve, I readily subscribe to the opinion of blending the two into one. Nothing surely can 
be more inconsistent with every principle of economy, 
than to keep up whole corps of officers for the sake 
of a handful of men. There cannot, I think, be a doubt 
of the propriety of reducing Hazen's regiment. The 
Canadian part of it may be formed into one or more 
companies according to their number, and be employed 
as watermen, or in other services suited to their circumstances ; the remainder may be turned over to the 
States to which they respectively belong. 

What prospects the States south of the Delaware 
have of getting their regiments filled, under the several 
modes adopted by them, I know not ; therefore I can 
give no opinion respecting them, but am certain that no 
regiment of infantry belonging to any State north of 
the Delaware ought to be reduced. Most of the staff 
departments of the army have undergone a recent 
change. Those, I presume, cannot want a revision. 
The cjuartermaster's department has been regulated 
without any participation of mine, and I know too little of its present constitution to form any judgment 
upon it. The same is the state of my knowledge respecting the clothier's department. I can only observe 
to you that, upon an application to me from the assistant clothier here for provisions, it appeared to me, 
thai he had more persons employed under him than 
were necessary, and on that principle I refused to give 
him an order for his full request. 

Thus, Sir, I have given you my sentiments on your queries. If they shall prove of any use in effecting the salutary purposes you wish, I shall think myself 
happy in contributing in this way to the general weal. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO JOHN DICKINSON, PRESIDENT OF DELAWARE. 

Head-Q,uarters, 19 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

I feel myself much obliged by the friendly communication of your sentiments to me on the subject of 
retaliation, conveyed under your favor of the 30th of 
May, a subject truly disagreeable and distressing to me. 
The horrid circumstances of barbarity, which introduced the instance now attracting our particular attention, came to me under the representation of so respectable a body of citizens, that they could not but 
gain my notice and interposition ; especially from a consideration, that, if it was not taken up in this line, the 
people, strongly provoked by their feelings, would probably have assumed the matter upon their own decision, and brought it to an issue under their own 
power, which mode of proceeding, if permitted, would 
have involved circumstances still more lamentable and 
calamitous. 

In taking my resolutions, I also found myself supported by many repeated declarations of Congress on 
this subject. And, after my resolutions were taken, I 
had the satisfaction to receive the fullest and most decided approbation of that honorable body in this particular instance. But, under all these circumstances, 
although I never had a doubt on the general propriety 
of the measure, yet it was not my intention, could it 
be avoided, to take, as a subject of retaliation, an officer 
under sanction of capitulation or convention ; and my first orders were issued agreeably to that idea ; but unIbrtunatclv it was rt'ported to nic, that no ollicer of an 
unc()ntliiii)nal ilcsciiptiun was in our possession, which 
laid niu under a necessity of giving further orders, exceeding my original intentions, in con^icquence of which 
the unhappy lot has fallen upon Captain Asgill, a prisoner under the capitulation of Vorktown. 

I feel myself exceedingly distressed on this occasion ; but, niy resolutions having been taken upon the 
most mature deIil)eralion, supported by the approbation 
of Congress, and grounded on tiie general concurrence 
of all the principal officers of the army, who were particularly consulted, they cannot be receded from. Justice to the army and the public, my own honor, and, I 
think I may venture to say, universal benevolence, require them to be carried into full execution. It rests, 
therefore, with the British commander-in-chief to prevent this unhappy measure from taking effect. An 
application is gone to Sir Guy Carleton from Captain Asgill, begging his interposition to avert his fate. The 
matter is now in agitation ; and I am told that a strict 
inquiry is making into the conduct of Lippencot, who 
is charged as being the principal perpetrator of the 
cruel murder of Captain liuddy. Should this inquiry 
lead to a giving of satisfaction, by a compliance with 
my original demand to Sir Henry Clinton, my feeUngs 
will be greatly relieved, and I need not assure you, 
that I shall receive the highest pleasure from such an 
event. I am, &,c.

Your favor of the 20th of June I have had the honor to receive. Could I view your Excellency's proposal for a meeting, as intended to involve objects of 
a military nature, I should have no objection to complying with your request ; but, if its purpose embraces (as would seem from your letter) only points of civil

TO COUNT DE KOCHAMBEAU. 

Newburg, 24 June, 1782. 

My dear Count, 

I have looked with anxious impatience ibr those despatches from your court, the arrival of which to you was 
to be the basis of our interview at Philadelphia. I have 
been in such daily expectation of this event, that I have 
not ventured more than fifteen miles from this place, 
lest your summons should arrive here in my absence. 

The season for operating in this quarter is flying 
away rapidly ; and I am more and more embarrassed 
in determining on the measures, which are proper to be 
pursued. If the aids, which are designed for us by 
your generous nation, are sufiiciently powerful, and arrive in season to warrant the enterprise against New 
York, not a moment should be lost in commencing 
your march this way. On the other hand, if the naval 
superiority, destined by his Most Christian Majesty for 
this coast, should be late in coming, or if, when it does 
arrive, our force should be judged inadequate to the 
siege of New York, and our arms are to be turned 
against Charleston, as the next object of importance, 
every step, which the French army under your Excellency's command might make this way, would not only 
serve to fatigue them, but the baggage, teams, and artillery horses, which are provided for the service of the 
campaign, would, by such a movement, be rendered 
unfit to perform a march to South Carolina, and every 
other expense incident to this manoeuvre would be 
needlessly increased. 

lu tliis state of uncertainty, which may also be accompanied by unexpected embarrassments occasioned 
by tiic late events in tiie West Indies, I lind myseH' at 
a loss to determine upon any thing, and could wish our 
interview to take place even under these circumstances, 
that we mi^^ht, by a live intercourse of sentiments upon 
certain hypotheses, mature matters in such a manner, 
as to facilitate any operations to which our force shall 
be adjudged competent (having regard to the season), 
when the plans of your court are aiuiouuccd to us. If 
you approve of such a meeting before you receive your 
despatches, you have only to inform me of it, and I 
shall attend to your time at Philadelphia, or any other 
place, at the shortest notice. 

I am at this moment on the point of setting out for 
Albany, on a visit to my posts in the vicinity of that 
place. My stay will not exceed eight or ten days, and 
will be shortened if any despatches should be received 
from you in the mean time.

Head-Quarters, 9 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

In answer to your letter of yesterday's date, containing the following queries, 

"Is the department of inspector-general necessary 
in the army, or is it not ? Has this department been 
conducted during the course of five years agreeably 
to your wishes ; and have the consequences resulting 
from my exertions as chief of the department answered

I give it as my clear opinion, that it has been of the 
Utmost Utility, and continues to be of the greatest importance, I'or reasons too plain and obvious to need 
enumeration ; but more especially tor having established one uniform system ot" mancEuvres and regulations 
in an army, composed of the troops of thirteen States 
(each having its local prejudices), and subject to constant interruptions and deviations from the frequent 
changes and dissolutions it has undergone. 

It is equally just to declare, that the department, 
under your auspices, has been conducted with an intelligence, activity, and zeal, not less beneficial to the 
public than honorary to yourself, and that I have had 
abundant reason to be satisfied with your abilities and 
attention to the duties of your office, during the four

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 9 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

Having found a moment's leisure to examine, myself, 
into the situation of aflairs on the frontiers of this State, 
I have lately made a journey up the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers as far as Saratoga and Schenectady. Just 
before my arrival there, a party of three or four hundred of the enemy, consisting of British, refugees, and 
savages, had made an incursion down the Mohawk, 
attacked, and captured (after a gallant defence) a small 
guard of Continental troops, who were stationed at the 
only remaining mill in the upper setdements, which 
they also destroyed. 

By a deserter from this party we are informed, that 
the enemy are taking post at Oswego, and are either 
rebuilding the old, or erecting new fortifications there. 

Whatever the design of the enemy may be by thus 
CK-cuijyiriii; a new post, and extending themselves on the 
frontier, I consider it my tUuy to inform Congress thereof, and have for that purpose taken the liberty to forward this liy tiie earliest safe conveyance since my 
return from the northward. 

I lia\ e the honor to enclose to your Excellency copies and extracts of sundry letters, which have lately 
passed between the British commander-in-chief and 
myself. The subjects contained in them being principally of a civil nature, I must beg leave to submit them 
to the consideration and direction of Congress. I think 
it only necessaiy to remark, that, notwithstanding the 
plausibility of the terms on which Sir Guy Carleton 
proposes the exchange of American seamen for British 
soldiers, in his letter of the 7th instant, it must still be 
obvious, that it would amount to nearly the same thing 
to have the prisoners so exchanged employed against 
our allies in the West Indies, as it would to have them 
acting against ourselves on the continent. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Newburg, 9 July, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

Your letter of the 22d of April, also your two favors of the 19th of May with the returns of the army 
under your command, have been duly received ; but, 
having been in momentary expectation, that intelligence would arrive from Europe, or some other event turn 
up, which might disclose the intentions of the enemy, 
and give a clue for the final determination of the operations of the campaign, I have delayed for a few days 
giving you my answer. Notwithstanding I am at this 
hour as much in the dark as ever, I can defer no longer 
the pleasure I always experience from indulging myself in a free communication and interchange of sentiments with you. To participate and divide our feelings, 
hopes, fears, and expectations with a friend, is almost 
the only source of pleasure and consolation left us, in 
the present languid and unpromising state of our atiairs. 

It gives me infinite satisfaction to find, that, by your 
prudence and decision, you have put a period to the 
progress of a dangerous mutiny, and, by your example 
of patience and firmness, reclaimed the army amidst all 
their aggravated sufferings to that good disposition, 
which it has been your great merit to preserve in your 
command through the worst of times. Their distresses are truly deplorable; and, while the almost insurmountable difliculty of transporting clothing and the 
smaller supplies (which, General St. Clair reports, are 
still detained on the road for want of the means of conveyance) gives me the most sensible pain and anxiety, 
it but too clearly proves the impracticability of removing 
by land, under our present prospects of finance, the 
siege artillery and immense quantity of stores necessary for a serious operation against Charleston. 

The disastrous event of the naval action in the West 
Indies may, indeed, and probably will now give a total 
alteration to the complexion of the campaign. This 
will, in all human probability, operate more than any 
other circumstance against the evacuation of the soudiern States ; for what would have before been a very 
hazardous fine of conduct, and would have exposed the enemy to a fatal blow in case of a naval coiiperation 
on this coast, may now be considered as a rational and 
prudent measure on their part. But the mode of defensive war (which the enemy alfect to have adopted, 
in which I would however place but very little confidence), and especially the detachment from Charleston, 
which must have weakened them considerably, will, I 
hope, enable you at all events to hold your own ground 
until the southern and middle States shall have made 
some eflbrts for your reinforcement, and initil the pecuniary affairs of the continent in general shall be put 
in a better situation. Some little, I flatter myself, will be 
done, although I must confess my expectations tor the 
campaign are not very sanguine. I feel with you, my 
dear friend, all the regret and mortification, that can 
possibly be conceived, li-om a consideration that we 
shall be able to avail ourselves so imperfectly of the 
weakness and embarrassments of our enemv ; while, on 
the other hand, I think there is reason to apprehend 
from some late indications the enemy have given, by 
taking post at Oswego and extending themselves on 
the frontier, that they mean, availing themselves of our 
languor and looking forwartl to the hour of pacification, 
to occupy as much territory as they are able to do, 
before a negotiation shall be entered upon. I wish we 
may be in a capacity to counteract their designs. 

I have given my opinion to Congress through the 
secretary at war, that it will be advisable to make a 
permanent incorporation of all the troops southward 
of the Delaware in the manner you propose ; but, as 
the observations did not apply to the other troops, 
these regiments ought to remain on their present establishment. 

As to the movement and tlisposition of the French 
ai-my, I will tell you exactly my idea and plan respecting it, and how the matter now rests. While we continued in the state of uncertainty, which has so long 
perplexed and prevented us from forming any projects 
whatever, I wished to have the corps of the Count de 
Rochambeau remain in a situation equally capable of 
looking either way, as circumstances might eventually 
require, being well persuaded in my own mind, that 
with their assistance (without the aid of a naval force) 
we should not at this time be able to do any thing 
effectual against New York, defended by its present 
garrison ; and, presuming still greater difficulties would 
oppose themselves to an attempt against Charleston, I 
proposed to postpone my final resolution until we should 
hear from the other side of the Atlantic. For, allowing 
your army, in conjunction with the French troops, to 
be completely competent to the object, the transportation by land of heavy artillery stores and apparatus appeared to me an inevitable obstacle, which I have fuUy 
explained in my letter of the 23d of April last. Besides, the diminution of an army in so long a march, 
and the innumerable advantages the enemy must derive from the command of the water, were considerations with me. And, as I flattered myself we might be 
able to keep the enemy in check with our present 
force, both in the northern and southern departments, 
I therefore thought it expedient, that the select corps 
of our allies in Virginia should continue unimpaired as 
a corps de reserve in that State, until new information or circumstances should produce new orders from 
me ; unless the Count de Rochambeau should first be 
apprized of some contingence or event, which should 
render a movement in his opinion proper; in which 
case the matter was left to his determination. I 
have this moment learned from his Excellency, the 
Minister of France, that the Count has already commenced his march northward. What circumstances 
have led to this, I am uiia!)le to say ; but expect to 
see the Count liimsch' in a lew ilays (by appointment) 
at Philadelphia, where it is jM-oposcd to enter into a 
discussion of the possible objects and views of the 
cainpais^n, so far as our i^eneral and imperfect knowledge of allairs will admit, and from whence I shall have 
the pleasure to inform you of any thing of moment, 
that niav in itu- mean time take place, or ultimately be 
in contemplation. 

Under an idea, that the French troops would certainly be withdrawn from Virginia at some moment of 
the campaign, and perhaps unexpectedly, I have long 
since written to Governor Harrison on that subject, 
imd requested that a body of men might be in readiness for the defence of the State on that occasion. Indeed I have written almost incessantly to all the States, 
urging, in the most forcible terms I could make use 
of, the absolute necessity of complying with the requisitions of Congress in furnishing their contingents of 
men and money, and am vinhappy to say the success 
of these applications has not been equal to my expectation. 

I am happy to assure you there was no foundation 
for the report of my having had a narrow escape in 
passing the Clove. In return, we have had a similar 
account respecting yourself, which I hope was equally 
groundless. Believe me, my dear Sir, I shall always 
consider myself deeply interested in whatever concerns you, and shall ever rejoice at your health, safety, 
and felicity. 

Mrs. Washington, who is just setting out for Virginia, joins me in most affectionate regards to Mrs. 
Greene and yourself. I am, dear Sir, with the most 
perfect esteem, &,c. 

P. S. Although the campaign does not promise 
much activity, yet I shall wish you to keep me as 
regularly and accurately informed of the state of your 
department as possible, noting the strength, movements, 
and position of your own army, and that of the enemy. It may also be essential for me to be made acquainted with the resources of the country and every 
thing of a military or political nature, which may be 
interesdng to our future plans and operations.

Head-Quarters, 10 July, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

The last post brought me your letter of the 19th of 
May. I must confess, that I am not at all astonished 
at the failure of your plun. That spirit of fieedoin, 
which at the commencement of this contest would 
have gladly sacriliced every thing to the attainment 
of its object, has long since subsided, and every selfish passion has taken its place. It is nut the public, 
but private interest, which inlluences tiie generality of 
mankind, nor can the Americans any longer boast an 
exception. Under these circumstances, it would rather 
have been surprising if you had succeeded, nor will 
you I fear have better success in Georgia. 

At the present moment, there is very little prospect 
of the campaign being much more active in this quarter tlian in yours. However, little can be positively 
determined, till we have some advices from Europe, 
which I am anxiously waiting for. When they arrive, 
I shall be better able to tell you what we may expect. Sir Guy Carleton is using every art to soothe 
and lull our people into a state of security. Admiral 
Digby is capturing all our vessels, and suflbcating as 
fast as possible in prison-ships all our seamen, who 
will not enlist into the service of his Britannic Majesty ; and Hiddimand, with his savage allies, is scalping 
and burning on the frontiers. Such is the line of conduct pursued by the dilferent commanders, and such 
their politics. You have my best wishes, being always sincerely yours.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 6 August, 1782. 

My DEAR Sir, 

In my last letter, I mentioned my expectation of 
soon meeting the Count de Rochambeau in Philadelphia, and my intention of writing to you from that 
place, in case any thing of moment should turn up in 
the mean while ; but as our hopes, that public despatches would have arrived from France before our 
meeting, have been disappointed, I can only inform you, 
that matters now rest in the same situation as described 
in my former letters, except with regard to the negotiations, which are said to be carrying on by the belligerent powers in Europe. 

Indeed, I hardly know what to think or believe of 
the disposition of the court of Britain. Certain it is, 
the new administration have made overtures of peace 
to the several nations at war, apparently with a design 
to detach some one or other of them from the 2;eneral combination ; but, not having succeeded in their 
efforts for a separate negodation, how far the necessity 
of affairs may carry them in their wishes for a general 
pacification upon admissible terms, I cannot undertake 
to determine. From the former infatuation, duplicity, 
and perverse system of British policy, I confess I am 
induced to doubt every thing, to suspect every thing ; 
otherwise I should suppose, from the subsequent extract of a letter from Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral 
Digby to me, dated the 2d instant, that the prospects 
of, and negotiation for, a general peace would be very 
favorable.

The speedy return of peace prevented the execution of this order, as 
well as that for the removal of the troops.

" We are acqiKiinled, Sir, by autliority, that negotiations for a general peace have already comniencetl at 
Paris, and that Mr. (Jrenville is invested witli full powers to treat with all parties at war, and is now at Paris 
in the execution of his commission. And we are likewise. Sir, further made accjuainted, that his Majesty, 
in order to remove all obstacles to that peace, which 
he so ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his 
ministers to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independency 
of the thirteen provinces should be proposed by him, 
in the first instimce, instead of making it a condition 
of a general treaty ; however, not without the highest 
confidence, that the loyalists shall be restored to their 
possessions, or a full compensation made them for whatever confiscations may have taken place." 

These communications, they say, had just arrived by 
a packet. They farther add, that iVIr. Laurens was 
enlarged from all engagements, and that transports were 
prepared for conveying all American prisoners to this 
country to be exchanged here. Whatever the real intention of the enemy may be, I think the strictest attention and exertion, which have ever been practised 
on our part, instead of being diminished, ought to be 
increased thereby. Jealousy and precaution, at least, 
can do no harm. Too much confidence and supinencss may be pernicious in the extreme. 

There having been a vague report, that a small embarkation of cavalry and inlantry was to take place at 
New York, to relieve part of the garrison of Charleston, I have made use of this occasion to desire the 
secretary at war to put Armand's legion immediately 
in motion to join you, and have requested he will use 
his endeavours to have the means afforded to facilitate and expedite the movement.

328 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [^t. 50. 

between Philadelphia and Trenton, in which, I am informed, there were letters from you to me. These 
were probably of the same date as your despatches to 
Congress, wherein the correspondence between General Leslie and yourself was enclosed. I mention this 
circumstance, that you may forward duplicates in case 
you should judge it necessary. 

You will, I imagine, have heard, before this reaches 
you, of the arrival of M. Vaudreuil with a fleet of thirteen ships of the line on this coast. I can give you no 
particulars, as I have no official account of his arrival. 
The army of the Count de Rochambeau, having, as I 
advised you in my last, marched towards the northward, it was concluded at our meeting in Philadelphia, 
upon a consideration of all circumstances, that this 
corps should proceed to join the army on the Hudson. They were at Baltimore by the last intelligence 
from that quarter. 

Since the receipt of the letter from the commissioners. Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby, I have seen 
a New York paper of the 3d instant, in which is a 
speech of General Conway, and some other articles, 
which appear to be designed to propose independence 
to America on certain conditions not admissible, namely, that the legislature of America should be totally 
independent of the Parliament of Great Britain, but 
that the King of England should have the same kind 
of supremacy here as in Ireland. I have not information sufficient to determine, whether this is the kind 
of independence alluded to in the letter of the commissioners, or not. I hope my suspicions, however, 
may be ill-founded. Wishing you all the success and 
happiness you can desire, I am, my dear Sir, with the

upon the practicability of the enterprise. It appears 
also from the same communication, that the French 
general has given him a partial, yet pretty plain disapprobation of the attempt, and has referred him to my 
opinion on the subject, which the Count de Rochambeau in his letter to me particularly requests tne to 
communicate to the Marquis on his arrival. 

However desirable the object may be, to dispossess 
the enemy from that troublesome post, yet under present circumstances and prospects I have not judged the 
attempt to be advisable, and have therefore given the 
French admiral my opinion decidedly against it. My 
particular sentiments on the subject will be conveyed 
to you in the copy of my letter to the Marquis, which 
I do myself the honor to enclose to your Excellency 
for your own observation, and that of the executive 
of your State. 

If, notwithstanding my sentiments and present appearances, other more favorable circumstances should turn up, or prospects should so alter as to make the 
attempt appear practicable in the judgment of the 
French admiral and General de Choisy, as also in the 
opinion of your executive, I have no doubt that your 
State will afford every assistance, in the most expeditious manner, in men, cannon, mortars, and military 
stores, that may be found necessary to carry the operation into effect. The distance of the army from 
Boston, with other circumstances, will render it impossible to give any timely aid from this quarter. 

I am, dear Sir, &c.

Having been informed that Major-General Gates is

TO COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Newburg, 1(3 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

Were we certain, that a pacification had advanced so far as your Excellency thinks it has, or could we he assured that the British ministry were really sincere in 
their offers, whicii have been communicated through their Commander-in-chief, Sir Guy Carleton, I should think you might, without any inconvenience or danger, 
await the orders of your court where you now are, 
and dismiss all your wagons. But when we consider, 
that negotiations are sometimes set on foot merely to 
gain time, that there are yet no offers on the part of 
the enemy for a general cessation of hostihties, and that, 
although their commanders in this country are in a 
manner tied down by the resolves of their House of 
Commons to a defensive war only, yet they may be at 
liberty to transport part of their force to the West Indies, I think it highly necessary, for the good of the common cause, and especially to prevent the measure, 
which I have last mentioned, to unite our force upon 
the North River ; and in this opinion I am confirmed by 
the sentiments contained in a letter trom the minister 
of France to the Marquis de Vaudreuil, which he has 
been good enough to leave open for my inspection. 

" From the different accounts I can collect," says he, 
"it seems to be the design of England to make a general peace ; but the demands on one side and the other 
will render a conclusion extremely difficult ; and in such 
a case that power will spare nothing to effectuate a 
peace with the United States, and turn all their efforts 
against us. As to a separate peace with the United 
States it will not take place. I am certain they will 
not make peace but in concert with us." The minister also says to me; "You will judge better than I 
can, whether it is proper to march the French army 
or not. It is certain, that it will be necessary, if the 
English show any disposition to detach a considerable 
force to the West Indies." What are the intentions of 
the enemy in this respect, it is impossible for me precisely to determine. Accounts from New York, but 
not on very good authority, still continue to mention an 
embarkation for the West Indies. The garrison of Savannah has arrived at New York, and there are some 
grounds for believing that Charleston will be evacuated. 
Should that event take place, and the garrison also 
come to New York, they might without danger detach 
considerably, should our force continue divided. 

Upon the whole. Sir, I hardly imagine you will think 
it prudent to dismiss your carriages under present appearances and circumstances ; and, if you do not, the 
cattle will be as easily and cheaply subsisted upon a 
march as in a settled camp. Should an accommodation take place, and should the orders of your court

call you iVoiu the cotitincat, your cmbarUation might be 
as easily iiuule upon (he Delaware or the Hudson, as 
upon the Chesapeake. I am of opinion, therefore, that 
no <roocl consequences can result from your remaining 
at Baltimore, but that many advantages may attend 
your marching forward, and forming a junction with this 
army. Actuated by no motives, but those which tend 
to the general good, I have taken the liberty of giving 
my sentiments with that freedom, wiili which I am 
convinced you would ever wish me to deliver them. 
I beg leave to return my thanks for the attention you 
have paid to the exchange, not only of Colonel Laumoy, but of several others of our officers. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 18 August, 1782. 

^Iv DEAR Sir, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your private 
letter of the 12th instant. I cannot but think the conduct respecting the release of Lord Cornwallis very 
extraordinary. Is it reasonable that Mr. Laurens should 
be at full liberty, and acting as a commissioner in Europe, while Lord Cornwallis, for whose liberation he 
pledged his own honor, and consequently as a public 
man that of the States, is held bound by his parole ? 
Either disavow the propriety of Mr. Laurens's conduct, 
and let him be remanded by the British ministry, or 
set Lord Cornwallis at equal liberty. I am placed in a 
very delicate situation. Sir Guy Carleton has given me 
official information of the ti-ansaction, and has called for 
a confirmation of Rlr. Laurens's act. I have referred 
the matter to the proper place, and I can obtain no 
answer. In my letters to General Carleton I am obliged 
to be for the present silent, but I certainly must expect 
to hear from him again. Do, my good Sir, endeavour 
to obtain a decision upon this matter. 

Your public letter of the 12th covers a resolve of the 
same date, authorizing me to propose a meeting of commissioners for establishing a cartel. Here again I am 
somewhat embarrassed, never having yet received either the approbation or disapprobation of Congress upon 
the proceedings of the former commissioners, General Knox and Mr. Gouverneur Morris, although they were 
transmitted so long ago as the 30th of April last. It 
appears by the report of those gentlemen, that the negotiation was broken off principally on account of the 
disposition, which plainly appeared on the part of the 
British commissioners to procure the exchange of their 
soldiers in our hands without settlement of accounts, or 
making any payment, or giving any security for the 
payment, of the large sum wliicli, we conceive, is due. 
Now Congress, in the resolve to which I have just referrcil, make no reference to any former transaction, but 
authorize me to settle a cartel, "taking care that the 
iiciuidation of accounts and settlement of the balance 
due for the maintenance of prisoners be provided for 
therein." From this it may possibly be inferred, that 
tin y do approve the former proceedings, and mean to 
make the settlement of accounts a preliminary ; but this 
is an inference only, and may be a Adse one ; and 
tlierelbre I wisii you to endeavour to find out the true 
meaning of the House, and to procure a determination 
upon the former proceedings. 

The same commissioners will probably be appointed 
upon our part, and, could they be assured their former 
principles were thought good, they would proceed with 
more confidence upon a future occasion. I confess to 
you, that I have found so many diniculties thrown in 
the way of all former transactions of this nature, that I 
could ever wish Congress to be as full and explicit as 
possible, as to the points which they would have either 
conceded or demanded. I would prefer that mode on 
many accounts to unlimited powers, as you may easily 
conceive. But what I princip;xlly now want to be assured of is, whether they do or do not approve the 
conduct of the former commissioners, and the principles 
which they seemed desirous of establishing. With 
much truth and affection, I am, &.C. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 19 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

Congress have been already furnished with copies of 
all letters, which had passed between the commandersin-chief of the British forces in New York and myself, 
respecting the murder of Captain Huddy previous to 
the last of July. I have now the honor to enclose Sir 
Guy Carleton's letter of the 1st instant, in reply to 
mine of the 30th ultimo, and that of the 13th, which 
accompanied the proceedings of the general courtmartial for the trial of Captain Lippencot. The proceedings, together with such other documents as relate to that unfortunate transaction, I also transmit by 
this opportunity. 

As Sir Guy Carleton, notwithstanding the acquittal 
of Lippencot, reprobates the measure in unequivocal 
terms, and has given assurance of prosecuting a further 
inquiry, it has changed the ground I was proceeding 
upon, and placed the matter upon an extremely delicate footing. 

It would be assuming in me to ascribe causes 
for actions different from those, which are ostensibly 
and plausibly assigned ; but, admitting that General Carleton has no other object than to procrastinate, he 
has, by disavowing the act, by declaring that it is held 
in abhorrence, by not even sanctioning the motives, 
which appear to have influenced Lippencot to become 
the executioner of Huddy, and by giving the strongest 
assurances that further inquisition shall be made, so 
far manifested the appearance of an earnest desire to 
bring the guilty to punishment, that I fear an act of retaliation upon an innocent person before the result of 
his inquisition is known, w^ould be considered by the impartial and unprejucliced world in an unfavorable and 
perhaps an unjuslifiahle point of view ; and more especially as the great end proposed by retaliation, which 
is to prevent a repetition, of outrages, has been in a 
manner answered. For, you will please to observe, by 
the extract from General Clinton's letter of the 2Gth of 
April to Governor Franklin, that he had exjiressly forbidden the Board of Directors to remove or exchange 
in future any prisoners of w ar in the custody of their 
commissary without having fn-st obtained his approbation and orders. 

The same reasons, which induced me to lay the 
first steps I took in this affair before Congress, urge me 
to submit it to them at its present stage. It is a great 
national concern, upon which an individual ought not to 
decide. I shall be glad to be favored with the determination of Congress as early as possible, as I shall 
.suspend giving any answer to Sir Guy Carleton, until 
I am informed how far they are satisfied with iiis conduct hitherto. 

I cannot close this letter without making a remark 
upon that part of Sir Guy Carleton's, in which he 
charges me with want of humanity in selecting a victim from among the British ollicers so early as I did. 
He ought to consider, that, by the usages of war and 
upon the principles of retaliation, I should have been 
justified in executing an ofliccr of equal rank with 
Captain Huddy immediately upon receiving proofs of 
his murder, and then informing Sir Henry Clinton that 
I had done so. Besides, it was impossible for me to 
foresee, that it would be so very long before the matter would be brought to some kind of issue.f 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Head-Q,uarters, 28 August, 1782. 

Sir, 

I do myself the honor to inform your Excellency, 
that, in obedience to the resolve of Congress of the 
12th instant, I proposed to Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Dighy a meeting of commissioners, for the purpose of settling a general cartel, which has been acceded to upon their part. Previously to the meeting 
of the respective commissioners, and before I can instruct those, who shall be appointed in behalf of the 
United States, it is absolutely necessary that I should 
be made acquainted with the determination of Congress upon the following points ; whether I am to confirm the exchange of Lord Cornwallis for Mr. Laurens ; and whether it is their intention, that the proposal contained in the letter of Sir Guy Carleton and 
Admiral Digby, of the 2d of August, "to exchange 
soldiers for sailors," on the conditions mentioned by 
those gendemen, should be acceded to. The latter, 
should we be fortunate enough to obtain a liquidation 
of accounts (and we must go prepared on the supposition ilmt \vc shall be able to effect it), will be the 
great point in controversy ; and, as it is one of vast 
political importance, I wish to be explicitly instructed 
upon it by Congress. As I cannot proceed I'urther in 
the business before I ara favored with answers to the 
foregoing, I must request your Excellency to be kind 
enough to furnish me  with them as soon as Congress 
shall have decided upon the several matters.

Instructions. 

SiK, 

You are hereby appointed to the command of West 
Point and its dependencies. But, as the army will lie 
for some time upon Verplanck's Point, you will consider yourself as relieved (ill I'urther orders from the 
care of attending to that post. Stony Point, and Dobbs's 
Ferry, which are part of the dependencies, except so 
far as relates to their being constantly supplied with 
the proper quantity of ordnance. I have so thorough a 
confidence in you, and so well am I acquainted with 
your ability and activity, that I think it needless to 
point out to you the great outlines of your duty. I 
recommend the following matters to your attention. 

To visit the redoubts frequently ; to see that they are 
kept in proper order ; that the garrisons allotted to 
them are alert, and that they make it an invariable 
rule to sleep within the works. They should each be 
furnished constantly with ten days' wood and water; and, if the contractors keep up such a magazine of 
salt provision upon the Point, as they ought to do by 
contract, the detached works should be provided with 
ten days' provision also. The rolls to be frequently 
called. No officer to be absent without your leave, 
and no non-commissioned officer or soldier without 
the leave of a field-officer. 

The quarter-master having reported a scarcity of 
tents, you will be pleased to remove the tenth Massachusetts regiment into the bari-acks, that their tents 
may be delivered up. No buildings, either public or 
private, are to be erected without your knowledge ; and, 
when applications are made to you for that purpose, 
you will, if they are admitted, direct the commanding 
engineer to point out the situations, that they may not 
interfere with the defences of the place. The public 
buildings now carrying on, and the alterations and repairs of the works, will engage your particular attention. You know the necessity of bringing them to a 
certain state before the frost sets in. Given at HeadQuarters, at Newburg, the 29th of August, 1782.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, Verplanck's Point, I September, 1789. 

Dear Sir, 

The late New York papers announce the evacuation 
of Charleston, as a matter which would certainly take place soon after the 7th of Auajiist. I h;i\ e, upon this 
informatiDn, written to Major-General Sinaliwood and 
Colonel Butler to send forward to this army the recruits of Maryland and Pennsylva»i;i, who are at Annapolis and Carlisle. I enclose the letters under fl} ing 
seals to you, that you may take the sense of Congress 
upon the matter, before the orders are carried into 
execution. 

Congress having determined what troops should compose the southern ai-my, I do not think myself absolutely at liberty to withdraw those, which are already 
there, or to stop the reinforcements intended for them, 
without first consulting Congress, which I mean to do 
through you. So long ago as the 18th of March last, 
I calculated from appearances upon the evacuation of 
the southern States; and I then wrote to General Greene to hold himself in readiness to march to the 
northward the moment such an event should seem certain. In my idea, the infantry apportioned to the two 
Carolinas and Georgia will be sullicient to be left in 
the southern quai-ter. The South Cai-olina regiment 
of artillery having been reformed, it may be thought 
necessary to leave the small remains of Harrison's and 
late Procter's there. It will be necessary, also, to consider what corps of horse shall remain. If Armand's 
legion have not yet removed from Charlottesville, they 
certainly ought not to proceed. After having consulted 
Congress, and made the proper arrangements, you will 
please to inform Major- General Greene of the result, 
that he may govern himself accordingly. The difficulty 
and enormous expense of supporting troops at the 
southward are sufficient inducements to draw as many 
from thence as we possibly can. 

The whole army, the garrison at West Point excepted, which is left under the command of Major-General Knox, moved down to this ground yesterday. 
I have sent Major-General Lord Stirling to Albany, to 
take the command of the two Continental regiments 
and the State troops upon the northern frontiers. The 
New York and Jersey lines have joined me here. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 8 September, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to reply to your Excellency's letter 
of the 23d of August, and to inform you, that MajorGenerals Heath and Knox are nominated by me to 
meet Lieutenant-General Campbell and Mr. Elliot, as 
commissioners for the purpose of settling a general 
cartel for an exchange of prisoners. I propose, Sir, 
that the meeting be held at Tappan, as an intermediate and convenient place, and that it commence on the 
18th day of this month, at which time my commissioners will attend, and will be accompanied by the commissary of prisoners. Your Excellency's favor of the 
29 th, enclosing a copy of Governor Livingston's letter 
to you of the 10th, came in due time to my hands. 
I am at a loss to discover for what purpose it was 
communicated to me ; especially as I have more than 
once observed to you, that in matters of civil resort 
I have ever avoided any interference, and have transmitted to you the approbation of the sovereign power 
of these United States for my so doing. And of this nature appears to be the case of Ezekicl Tilton, who is 
the subject of your correspondence with the Governor. 

I cannot help remariiing, that your Excellency has 
several times lately taken occasion to mention, that "all 
hostilities stand suspended on your part." I must confess, that, to me, this expression wants explanation. I 
can iiave no conception of a suspension of hostilities, 
but that which arises from a mutual agreement of the 
powers at w ar, and which extends to naval as well as 
land operations. That your Excellency has thought 
proper, on }our part, to make a partial suspension, may 
be admitted ; but, whether this has been owing to political or other motives, it is not for me to decide. It 
is, however, a well known fact, that at the same time 
the British cruisers on our coasts have been more than 
usu;ilJy alert ; and, while Americans are admitted to understand their real interests, it will be difficult for them, 
when a suspension of hostilities is spoken of, to separate 
the idea of its extending to the sea as well as land. 

I cannot ascribe the inroads of the savages upon our 
northwestern frontier to the causes, from which your 
Excellency supposes them to originate ; neither can I 
allow, that they are committed without directions from 
the commander-in-chief in Canada. For by prisoners and deserters it is apparent, that those ravaging 
parties are composed of white troops, uikK r the command of officers regularly commissioned, as well as 
savages; and it would be a solecism to suppose, that 
such parties could be out, without the knowledge of 
their commander-in-chief. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO JAMES MCHENRT, 

Verplanck's Point, 13 September, 1762. 

My dear Sir, 

Our prospects of peace ai-e vanishmg. The death 
of the Marquis of Rockingham has given a shock to the 
new administration, and disordered its whole system. 
Fox, Burke, Lord John Cavendish, Lord Keppel,' and I 
believe others, have left it. Earl Shelburne takes the 
lead, as first lord of the treasuiy, to which oflice he 
was appointed by the King, the moment the vacancy 
happened by the death of Lord Rockingham. This 
nobleman declares, that the sun of Great Britain will 
set the moment American independence is acknowledged, and that no man has ever heard him give an 
assent to the measure. The Duke of Richmond, on 
the other hand, asserts, that the ministry, of which Lord 
Shelburne is one, came into office upon the express 
condition, and pledged to each other, that America 
should be declared independent ; that he will watch 
him, and, the moment he finds him departing therefrom, 
he will quit the administration, and give it every opposition in his po\Aer. 

That the King will push the war, as long as the nation will find men or money, admits not of a doubt in 
my mind. The whole tenor of his conduct, as well as 
his last proroguing speech, on the 11th of July, plainly 
indicates it, and shows in a clear point of view the impolicy of relaxation on our part. If we are wise, let us 
prepare for the worst. There is nothing, which will 
so soon produce a speedy and honorable peace, as a 
state of preparation for war; and we must either do 
this, or lay our account to patch up an inglorious peace, 
after all the toil, blood, and treasure we have spent. 
This has been my uniform opinion ; a doctrine I have endeavouretl, amidst the universal expectation of an 
approafhiiii^ peace, to iiieiikate, and whicli I am sure 
the event will justify. WiUi much truth, I am, &.C.

Sir, 

1 Iiave the pleasure to acknowledge your favor, informing me of your proposal to present me with fifty 
copies of your last publication t for the amusement of 
the army. For this intention you have my sincere 
thanks, not onlv on my own account, but for the pleasure, which I doul)t not the gentlemen of the army 
will receive from the perusal of your pamphlets. 

Your observations on the period of seven years, as it 
applies to British minds, are ingenious, and I wish it 
may not fail of its effects in the present instance. 
The measures and the policy of the enemy are at present in great perplexity and embarrassment. But I 
have my fears, whether their necessities, the only operating motives with them, have yet arrived to that point, 
which must drive them unavoidably into what they will 
esteem disagreeable and dishonorable terms of peace ; 
such, for instance, as an absolute, unequivocal admission of American independence, on the terms upon 
which we can accept it. For this reason, added to 
the obstinacy of the King, and the probable consonant 
principles of some of the chief ministers, I have not 
so full confidence in the success of the present negotiation for peace as some gentlemen entertain. Should events prove my jealousies to be ill I'ounded, I shall 
make myself happy uinler the mistake, consoling myself with the idea of having erred on the safest side, 
and enjoying with as much satisfaction as any of my 
countrymen the pleasing issue of our severe contest.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Verplanck'a Point, 23 September, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

I hope before this reaches you, that you will be in 
possession of Charleston, and will have found a glorious 
end to your dilliculties and distresses in the southern 
quarter. 

An application from the government of South Carolina produced the resolve, of which the enclosed is a 
copy, and which, I doubt not, was immediately transmitted to you. From your being upon the spot, and 
from your thorough knowledge of southern affairs, I 
shall leave the execution of the resolve in a great 
measure to your own judgment. As you observe in 
your letter of the 12th of August, when my directions 
of the 18th of March last were given, they were upon 
a presumption, that the enemy might evacuate Charleston in such season, that the troops destined to return 
to the northward miglit be here time enough to render 
service before the close of the campaign ; l)ur, that not 
being the case, their immediate removal does not become so essential ; and therefore I leave it with you, 
either to retain the corps, which you may ultimately 
determine to send northward, until the weather becomes favorable for marching in the spring, or to send 
them forward immediately as far as Virginia at least, if you find their subsistence more difficult and expensive, than it would be in the middle States. I will 
just give you a hint, that I fear subsistence will be 
upon a very precarious footing here during the winter ; 
and you know the inconvenience of having troops arrive 
at the cantonment late in the season. 

The arrangement made by you for the distribution 
of the southern army agrees perfectly, in the main, with 
my own judgment. I think, for the following reason, 
that the first and third regiments of cavalry had best 
be left in Carolina. They both belong to Virginia, and 
will more than probably be incorpoi-ated the next year. 
Their separation, therefore, would render the incorporation difficult ; and, as cavalry are of no great use in this 
quarter in offensive operations, and more easily subsisted southward than here, I am not anxious to have 
Lee's legion. But with this you will do as you think 
best. Armand's legion will not advance. I shall recommend their wintering in Virginia, as forage will be 
extremely scarce in all this country, owing to the severest drought ever known. 

By the resolve before alluded to, I am directed to 
make the necessary inquiry into the circumstances of 
the southern States, and to employ such force therein 
as I may think proper, and to direct you, whilst in the 
southern department, to employ the troops under your 
command offensively or defensively in such manner as 
may be most conducive to the interest of the United 
States. 

The execution of the foregoing, I must, for the reasons 
mentioned in the beginning of my letter, leave also to 
you. Should the enemy evacuate the southern States, 
I know of no offensive operations but against St. Augustine, or the savages. The former I believe is out of our power, even were we authorized to undertake 
siicli ;m expedition ; and ilic latter must depend upon contingencies. I do not apprcliend nnidi ilangcr l'a)ni 
the savages, when tlic British ai-e expelled I'roiu the seacoast. 

You will perceive it is the intention of Congress, 
that you should remain personally at the southward 
until further orders. You will, I doubt not, use every 
iirgument to induce those States to exert themselves 
in raising a permiment force tin- their own defence. 
They cannot expect, that, if the enemy evacuate the 
southern States, and keep a footing at New York, and 
at other places to the northward and eastward, the foi-ce 
of almost half the Union should be kept in the southern 
States for defence only. 

The situation of politics, I mean European, is upon 
so precarious a footing, that I really know not what 
account to give of them. Negotiations were still going 
on at Pans in the middle of July ; but the prospects of 
a peace were checked by the death of the Marquis of 
Rockingham. Dr. Franklin's laconic description of the 
temper of the British nation seems most apt. "They 
are," says he, " unable to carry on the war, and too 
proud to make peace." I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 

I shall be obliged to you, or some friend in Congress, 
to inform me what has been or is likely to be done with 
respect to my reference of the case of Captain Huddy. 
I cannot forbear complaining of the cruel situation, 
which I now am and oftentimes have been placed 
in, by the silence of Congress in matters of high 
importance, which the good of the service, and my 
official duty have obliged me to call upon them, as the 
sovereign power of these United States, to decide. It 
is only in perplexing and intricate cases, that I have 
requested their orders, being always willing to bear my 
proportion of public embarrassments, and take a full 
share of responsibility. Conscious that I have treated 
that honorable body, and all their measures, with as 
much deference and respect as any officer in the United States, I expected this aid. 

Wliv, tlien, if policy forbids a decision upon the dilHcult points I have referred, I am not to be informed 
of it, is beyond my conception, unless I were to ascribe it to causes, which I Hatter myself do not exist. 
When I refer a matter to Congress, every proceeding 
on my part is suspended, until their pleasure is transmitted ; and for this it is well known I have waited 
with unexampled patience. But when no notice is 
taken of my application ; when measures, which I 
might otherwise adopt, are suspended ; when my own 
feelings are wounded, and others perhaps are suH'ering 
by the delay, how is it possible for me to forbear expressing my disquietude I 

The particuUu" cause of it at this time arises from two 
things. First, while I am totally silent to the public, 
vvaitinEC the decision of Con!=rress on the case of Huddv, 
I see publications on this head (importing reflections) 
in one of the Pennsylvania papers, which no man could 
have made, that had not access to my oHicial letter of 
the 19th of August to Congress; and, secondly, because I feel exceedingly for Captain Asgill, who was 
designated by lot in retaliation for the death of Captain Iluddy. While retaliation was apparently necessary, 
however disagreeable in itself, I had no repugnance to 
the measure. But, when the end proposed by it is 
answered, by a disavowal of the act, by a dissolution 
of the boanl of refugees, and by a promise (whether 
with or without meaning to comply with it, I shall not 
determine), that further inquisition should be made into 
the matter, I thought it incumbent upon me, before I 
proceeded any farther in the matter, to have the sense 
of Congress, who had most explicitly approved, and 
impliedly indeed ordered retaliation to take place. To 
this hour I am held in darkness. 

The letter of Asgill, a copy of which I enclose, and the situation of his father, which I am made acquainted 
with by the British prints, work too powerfully upon 
my humanity not to wish, that Congress would chalk a 
Hue for me to walk by in this business. To effect this, 
is the cause of the trouble you now receive from, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 2 October, 1782. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency will have been informed, by your 
commissioners, of the causes which obstructed their 
proceeding upon business at the late meeting at Tappan. The commissioners on the part of the United 
States laid before those appointed by your Excellency 
and Admiral Digby a remonstrance, on the subject of 
the immense expense arising from the support of so 
great a number of British prisoners as we now have 
in our possession, without any present compensation 
or proper security for the payment hereafter. This 
remonstrance your commissioners did not think themselves at Uberty to accept. I am, therefore, under the 
necessity of furnishing your Excellency with a copy of ir, and of assuring yoii, a<;;rocal)ly to my instructions, 
from tiie liononibie tlic Congress of tiie United States, 
" that, if this, Hke former representations, should produce no cllect, it will be high time to take measures, 
however disagreeable, for diminishing a burthen which 
is become intolerable." I have the honor to be, &lc.

TO THE SECRETARY AT WAR. 

Head-Quarters, 2 October, 1783. 

My dear Sir, 

Painful as the task is to describe the dark side of 
our affairs, it sometimes becomes a matter of indispensable necessity. Without disguise or palliation, I will 
inform you candidly of the discontents, which at this 
moment prevail universally throughout the army. 

The evils, of which they complain, and which they 
suppo.se almost remediless, are the total want of money 
or the means of existing from one day to another, the 
heavy debts they have already incurred, the loss of 
credit, the distress of their families at home, and the 
prospect of poverty and misery before them. It is vain. 
Sir, to suppose, that military men will acquiesce contentedly with bare rations, when those in the civil walk 
of life, unacquainted with half the hardships they endure, are regularly paid the emoluments of office. 
While the human mind is inlluenced by the same passions and inclinations, this cannot be. A military man 
has the same turn for sociability as a person in civil 
life. He conceives himself equally called upon to live 
up to his rank, and his pride is hurt when circumstances restrain him. Only conceive, then, the mortification they must suffer (even the general officers), 
Avhen they cannot invite a French officer, a visiting 
friend, or a travelling acquaintance, to a better repast, 
than bad whiskey (and not always that) and a bit of 
beef without vegetables will afford them. 

The officers also complain of other hardships, which 
they think might and ought to be remedied without 
delay ; such as the stopping of promotions, where there 
have been vacancies open for a long time ; the withholding of commissions from those, who are justly entitled to them, and have wairants or certificates of their 
appointments from the executives of their States ; and 
particularly the leaving of the compensation for their 
services in a loose, equivocal state, without ascertaining 
their claims upon the public, or making provision for 
the future payment of them. 

While I premise, that no one I have seen or heard 
of appears opposed to the principle of reducing the 
army as circumstances may require, yet I cannot help 
fearing the result of the measure in contemplation, under present circumstances, when I see such a number 
of men, goaded by a thousand stings of reflection on 
the past and of anticipation on the future, about to be 
turned into the world, soured by penury and what they 
call the ingratitude of the pubhc, involved in debts 
without one fartliing of money to carry them home, after having spent the flower of their days, and many 
of them their patrimonies, in establishing the freedom 
and independence of their country, and suffered every 
thing that human nature is capable of enduring on this 
side of death. I repeat it, that when I consider these 
irritating circumstances, without one thing to soothe 
their feelings or dispel the gloomy prospects, I cannot 
avoid apprehending that a train of evils will follow, of a 
very serious and distressing nature. On the other hand, could the ollicers be placed in as good a situation, as when they came into service, the contention, I 
am persuaded, would be, not who siiould continue in 
the field, but who should retire to private hfe. 

I wish not to heighten the shades of the picture so 
far as the reality would justify nie in doing it. I could 
give anecdotes of patriotism and distress, which have 
scarcely ever been paralleled, never surpassed in the 
history of mankind. But, you may rely upon it, the patience and long-sullering of this army are almost exhausted, and that there never was so great a spirit of 
discontent as at this instant. While in the field, I think 
it may be kept from breaking out into acts of outrage ; 
but when we retire into winter-quarters, unless the 
storm is previously dissipated, I cannot be at ease respecting the consequences. It is high time for a peace. 

To you, my dear Sir, I need not be more particular 
in describing my anxiet}- and the grounds of it. You 
are too well acquainted, from your own service, with 
the real sufferings of the army, to require a longer detail. I will, therefore, only add, that, exclusive of the 
common hardships of a military life, our troops have 
been and still are obliged to perform more services 
foreign to their proper duty, without gratuity or reward, than the soldiers of any other army; for example, the immense labors expended in doing the duty 
of the artificers in erecting fortifications and military 
works, the fatigue of building for themselves barracks 
or huts annually, and of cutting and transporting 
wood for the use of all our posts and garrisons without any expense whatever to the public. 

Of this letter, which, from the tenor of it, must be 
considered in some degree of a private nature, you may 
make such use as you shall think proper, since the 
principal objects of it are, by displaying the merits, 
the hardships, the disposition, and critical state of the army, to give information that may eventually be useful, and to convince you with what entire confidence 
and esteem, I am, my dear Sir, &.c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 18 October, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

The death of Colonel Laurens I consider as a very heavy misfortune, not only as it affects the public at large, but particularly so to his family, and all his private iVicnds and connexions, to whom his amiable and useful cluinictor has rciKlercd him peculiarly dear. 

The campaign in this quarter is coming lo a close, 
without any events of great importance. The intentions of the enemy at New York still remain undecided. 
Their fleet continues in the harbour, making every 
preparation for sailing, which I fancy is delayed in 
expectation of the arrival of the packet, which is hourly looked for. It is not yet known, but strongly conjectured, that a detachment of troops will go from 
New York to the West Indies with the fleet. Sir 
Guy Carleton has called in most of his out-posts, contracted his lines near the city, and is making his garrison of New York as compact as possible. Many 
have flattered themselves, that an evacuation would 
take place before Avinter, but I have no such idea. 
With much regard and esteem, &c.

TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Head-Q.uarters, 18 October, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with two favors of your Excellency, one presented by the Count de Segur, of 
the 2d of April, the other delivered by the Prince de 
Broglie,t of the 8th, both of which were rendered 
doubly agreeable by the pleasure I had in receiving 
them from the hands of two such amiable and accomplished young gentlemen. Independently of my esteem for your Excellency, be assured. Sir, that my respect and regard for the French nation at large, to 
whom this country is under so great obligations, as well 
as the very favorable impressions I have conceived for 
their particular characters, will secure my warmest attention to the persons of these distinguished young 
noblemen. 

I am much obliged by the political information, which 
you have taken the trouble to convey to me, but feel 
myself much embarrassed in my wish to make you a 
return in kind. Early in the season, the expectations 
of America were much raised in coasetjueiice of the 
chani;e of the British ministry, and tiie measures of 
Parliajuent ; i)Ut events have shown that our iiopes have 
risen too high. The ih-ath of the Marquis of Rockingiiam, the advancement of the Earl of Shelburne, 
antl the delays of ne.i^otiation, have given us very different impressions from those we at lirst received. 
We now begin again to rellect upon the persevering 
obstinacy of the King, the wickedness of his ministry, 
and the haughty pride of the nation, wliieh recall to 
our minds very disagreeable recollections, and a probable continuance of our present troubles. The military 
operations of the campaign are drawing to a close without any very important events on this side of the water, 
unless the evacuation of Chai-leston, which is generally 
expected, but not yet known to me, should take place, 
and form a paragraph in the page of this year's history. 
The British (leet from the West Indies still continues 
in New York. I have not been able yet to decide on 
the enemy's intentions there. It is generally thought, 
that a detachment of their troops will sail, when the 
fleet returns to the West Indies, where it is conjectured their efforts for the winter will be prosecuted 
with vigor. I have the honor to be, &.c.

TO GOVERNOR CLINTOX. 

Head-Quartere, 19 October, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have received your favor of the l.'Sth instant with 
the enclosures ; and, though at the same time it is true, 
I have the general command of the allied army, as to 
all its movements and operations, yet I have never considered myself as having an absolute right to interfere 
with the internal police and regulations of the French 
army, under the immediate orders of his Excellency 
the Count de Rochambeau ; with which army it appears the persons mentioned in the papers contained in 
your letter are connected. I have, however, in order 
to produce an amicable settlement of the matter, communicated the contents to Colonel Wadsworth, and requested him to use his utmost endeavours to prevent 
any altercations and quarrels between the citizens of 
this State and the people employed by him. As he has 
engaged, that they will not impede the due execution 
of the civil authority, and as he writes to you by this 
conveyance, I cannot but hope matters will be explained to your satisfaction. 

For my own part I shall still continue to exert all 
my influence and authority to prevent the interruption 
of that harmony, which is so essential, and which has 
so generally prevailed between the army and the inhabitants of the country ; and I need scarcely add, that 
in doing this I shall give every species of countenance 
and support to the execution of the laws of the land. 

In the present quiet state of the frontiers, and with 
assurances fiom Sir Guy Carleton, that the incursions of 
the savages are stopped by authority, I have it in contemplation to withdraw the Continental troops from the 
northward. There are many reasons, which will make 
that measure eligible, unless the troops, who have been 
raised on purpose for the defence of the frontiers of 
this State, should be thought incompetent to the duty, 
even taking into consideration the inactivity of the season aiitl the situation of ad'airs ; for, indeed, I confess, 
I til) not consider the late reports of the L-nemy's being 
in force at the Isle-au-Noix to indicate any thing farther than an attention to their own security. The 
severity of the a]>proaching season, and every other circumstance, appear to me to militate against an attack 
upon our possessions this winter, and we shall not be 
at so great a distance, but that succour may be afforded 
as early in the s[iring as shall be necessary. At any 
rate, some measures n)ust be immediately taken relative to the troops now there. I should be happy in 
receiving your sentiments as soon as may be, and am 
with great esteem and regard, &,c.

just come to my hands by a flag of truce from New

interposition in favor of the life of Captain Asgill. I

Head-Quarters, 13 November, 1782. 

Sir, 

It affords me singular pleasure, to have it in my 
power to transmit to you the enclosed copy of an act 
of Congress, of the 7th instant, by which you are released from the disagreeable circumstances in which 
you have so long been. Supposing that you would 
Avish to go into New York as soon as possible, I also 
enclose a passport for that purpose. 

Your letter of the 18th of October came regularly 
to my hands. I beg you to believe, that my not answering it sooner, did not proceed from inattention to 
you, or a want of feeling for your situation. I daily 
expected a determination of your case, and I thought it 
better to await that, than to feed you with hopes, that 
might, in the end, prove fruitless. You will attribute 
my detention of the enclosed letters, which have been 
in my hands about a fortnight, to the same cause. 

I cannot take leave of you. Sir, without assuring 
you, that, in whatever light my agency in this unpleasing affair may be viewed, I was never influenced, 
through the whole of it, by sanguinary motives, but by 
what I conceived to be a sense of my duty, which 
loudly called upon me to take measures, however disagreeable, to prevent a repetition of those enormities, 
which have been the subject of discussion. And that 
this important end is likely to be answered, without 
the effusion of the blood of an innocent person, is not 
a greater relief to you, than it is to, Sir, your most

judge-advocate to make further inquisition, and to collect evidence for the prosecution of such other persons 
as may appear to have been criminal in this transaction." In full confidence, that measures have been 
taken to carry your Excellency's intentions into execution, I have to request the favor of you to inform

TO COUNT DE VERGENNES. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 21 November, 1782. 

Sir, 

After I had the honor of receivmg your Excellency's 
letter of the 29th of July, I lost not a moment in 
transmitting it to Congress, who had then under deliberation the proceedings of the British court-martial upon Captain Lippencot for the murder of Captain Huddy, and the other documents relating to that inhuman 
transaction. What would otherwise have been the determination of that honorable body, I will not undertake 
to say ; but I think I may venture to assure your Excellency, that your generous interposition had no small 
degree of weight in procuring that decision in favor of 
Captain Asgill, which he had no right to expect from 
the very unsatisfactory measures, which had been taken 
by the British commander-in-chief to atone for a crime 
of the blackest dye, not to be justified by the practices of war, and unknown at this day amongst civilized nations. I however flatter myself, that our enemies have been brought to view this transaction in its 
true light, and that we shall not experience a repetition of the like enormity. 

Captain Asgill has been released, and is at perfect 
liberty to return to the arms of an aflectionate parent, 
whose pathetic address to your Excellency could not 
fail of interesting every feeling heart in her behalf. I 
have no right to assume any particular merit from the 
lenient manner in which this disagreeable aflair has terminated. But I beg you to believe. Sir, that I most 
sincerely rejoice, not only because your humane intentions are gratified, but because the event accords with 
the wishes of his Most Christian Majesty, and his royal 
and amiable consort, who, by their benevolence and 
munificence, have endeared themselves to every true 
American. I have the honor to be, &c.

impressions of esteem, which opportunities and your 
own benevolent niiuil have since improved into a deep

TO JOSKl'll JONKS, I.V CONGRESS. 

Nfivburg, M December, 1782. 

Dk.vr Sir, 

In the course of a few days, Congress will, I expect, 
receive an aiklress from the army on the subject of 
their grievances. This adilress, though couched in very 
respectful terms, is one of those things, which, though 
unpleasing, is just now unavoidable. For I was very 
apprehensive once, that matters would take a more 
untiuorable turn, from the variety of discontents which 
prevail. 

The temper of the army is much soured, and has 
become more irritable than at any period since the 
commencement of the war. This consideration alone 
prevented me (for every thing else seemed to be in a 
state of inactivity and almost tranquillity) from requesting leave to spend this winter in Virginia, that I might 
give some attention to my long-neglected private concerns. The dissatisfactions of the army had arisen to 
a great and alarming height, and combinations among 
the ofiicers to resign at given periods in a body were 
beginning to take place, when, by some address and 
management, their resolutions have been converted into 
the form in which they will now appear before Congress. What that honorable body can or will do in the matter, does not belong to me to determine ; but policy, 
in my opinion, should dictate soothing measures ; as it 
is an uncontrovertible fact, that no part of the community has undergone equal hardships, and borne them 
with the same patience and fortitude, as the army 
has done. 

Hitherto the officers have stood between the lower 
order of the soldiery and the public ; and in more instances than one, at the hazard of their lives, have 
quelled very dangerous mutinies. But if their discontents should be suffered to rise equally high, I know 
not what the consequences may be. The spirit of enthusiasm, which overcame every thing at first, is now 
done away. It is idle, therefore, to expect more from 
military men, than from those discharging the civil departments of government. If both were to fare alike, 
with respect to the emoluments of office, I would answer for it, that the military character should not be the 
first to complain. But it is an invidious distinction, and 
one that will not stand the test of reason or policy, that 
one set should receive all, and the other no part (or 
that which is next to it), of their pay. In a word, the 
experiment is dangerous ; and, if it succeeded, would 
only prove, that the one class are actuated by more 
zeal than the other, not that they have less occasion 
for their money. I am, with sincere esteem, &,c.

TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

Newburg, 8 January, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

The Marquis, in his letter to me, is not very explicit 
in his sentiments respecting the negotiations of peace, 
but refers me to his ofllcial letter to you for his thoughts 
at large. In general lie holds up an idea, which perfectly accords with my opinion, that nothing will be 
concluded until the meeting of the British Parliament; 
ami, if matters are not brought to a favorable issue in 
a month afterwards, that the war will rage in all its fury. 

Ever since the secession of Mr. Fox and others from 
the administration, I have been decidedly of opinion, 
that peace would not take place before that epoch ; 
that it would depend upon the strength of the contending parties and their inlliu'nce on the nation, whether it would then happen or not ; and that the intermediate space would be employed in intriguing, in an 
investigation of powers, in hearing propositions, and in 
probing the intentions of one another to the bottom. 
These I suppose would have been pretty well understood on all sides by the 26th of November,t as the 
ground on which Lord Shclhurne is placed also would. 
It follows then, in my judgment, that the ministry 
would communicate to, and take the sense of Parliament on the terms upon which peace could be obtained ; and leave it with the nation to accept them, or 
furnish the means of prosecuting the war vigorously. 
The power given to IMr, Oswald, to treat with any 
commissioner or commissioners properly authorized 
from the United States of America, is more than I 
expected would happen before the meeting of Parliament. But, as the gentlemen on the part of America 
could not treat with him unless such powers were 
given, it became an act of necessity to cede them to 
effect their other purposes. Thus I account for the 
indirect acknowledgment of our independence by the King, who, I dare say, felt some severe pangs at the 
lime he put his hand to the letters patent. It is not, 
however, less efficacious or pleasing on that account ; 
and breaking the ice is a great point gained. There 
can be but very little doubt, I believe, of the conclusion 
of the commercial treaty with Holland ; but I have apprehensions, that that power will be the most difficult 
to satisfy at the general treaty of peace. 

It is with great pain I hear of the repeal of the impost law in Virginia. What could induce it ? What 
office is Mr. Jeflerson appointed to, that he has, you 
say, lately accepted? If it is that of commissioner of 
peace, I hope he will arrive too late to have any hand 
in it. My best respects to him when he arrives ; and 
compliments to Mrs. Livingston, in which Mrs. Washington joins. I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO BUSHROD WASHINGTON.f 

Newburg, 15 January, 1783. 

Dear Bushrod, 

You will be surprised, perhaps, at receiving a letter 
from me ; but if the end is answered for which it is 
written, I shall not think my time misspent. Your father, who seems to entertain a very favorable opinion 
of your prialencc, and I hope you merit it, in one or 
two of his letters to me  speaks of the eliHieulty he ie 
under to make you remittances. Whether this arises 
from the scantiness of his funds, or tiie extensivcness 
of your demands, is matter of conjecture with me. I 
hope it is not the latter; because common prudence, and 
every other consideration, which ought to iiave weight 
in a reflecting mind, are opposed to your retjuiring more 
than his convenience and a regard to his other children 
will enable him to pay ; and because he holds up no 
idea in the letter, which would support me in the conclusion. Yet when I take a view of the inexperience 
of youth, the temptations and vices of cities, and the 
distresses to which our A'irginia gentlemen are driven 
by an accumulation of taxes and the want of a market, 
I am almost inclined to ascribe it in part to both. 
Therefore, as a friend, I give you the following advice. 
Let the object, which carried you to Philadelphia, be 
always before your eyes. Remember, that it is not 
the mere study of the law, but to become eminent in 
the profession of it, that is to yield honor and profit. 
The first was your choice ; let the second be your 
ambition. Dissipation is incompatible with both ; the 
company, in which you will improve most, will be least 
expensive to you ; and yet I am not such a stoic as to 
suppose that you will, or to think it right that you 
should, always be in company with senators and philosophers ; but of the juvenile kind let me advise you 
to be choice. It is easy to make acquaintances, but 
verj- dilFicult to shake them off, however irksome and 
unprofitable they are found, after we have once committed ourselves to them. The indiscretions, which very often they involuntarily lead one into, prove equally distressing and disgraceful. 

Be courteous to all, but intimate with few ; and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and 
must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation. 

Let your heart feel for the afflictions and distresses 
of every one, and let your hand give in proportion to 
your purse ; remembering always the estimation of the 
widow's mite, but, that it is not every one who asketh, 
that deserveth charity ; all, however, are worthy of the 
inquiry, or the deserving may suffer. 

Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine men, 
any more than fine feathers make fine birds. A plain, 
genteel dress is more admired, and obtains more credit, 
than lace and embroidery, in the eyes of the judicious 
and sensible. 

The last thing, which I shall mention, is first in importance ; and that is, to avoid gaming. This is a vice, 
which is productive of every possible evil ; equally injurious to the morals and health of its votaries. It is 
the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity, and the 
father of mischief. It has been the ruin of many worthy tamilies, the loss of many a man's honor, and the 
cause of suicide. To all those who enter the lists, it is 
equally fascinating. The successful gamester pushes his 
good fortune, till it is overtaken by a reverse. The losing gamester, in hopes of retrieving past misfortunes, goes 
on from bad to worse, till grown desperate he pushes 
at every thing and loses his all. In a word, kw gain by 
this abominable practice, while thousands ai-e injured. 

Perhaps you will say, « My conduct has anticipated 
the advice," and " Not one of the cases applies to 
me." I shall be heartily glad of it. It will add not a 
little to my happiness, to find those to whom I am so 
nearly connected pursuing the right walk of life. It will be the sure road to my favor, and to those honors 
and places of profit, which their country can bestow ; 
as merit rarely goes unrewarded. I am, dear Bushrod, 
vour allectionate uncle.

TO LADY STIRLING. 

Newburg, 20 January, 1783. 

Having been informed by a letter from Captain Sill, 
of the unspeakable loss which your Ladyship has experienced, I feel the sincerest disposition to alleviate 
by sympathy those soitows, which I am sensible cannot be removed or effaced. For this pui-pose, I would 
also have suggested every rational topic of consolation, 
were I not fully persuaded, that the principles of philosophy and religion, of which you are possessed, had 
anticipated every thing that I could say on the subject. 

It only remains, then, as a small but just tribute to 
the memory of Lord Stirling, to express how deeply I 
share in the common affliction, on being deprived of the 
public and professional assistance, as well as the private friendship, of an officer of so high rank, with whom 
I had lived in the strictest habits of amity ; and howmuch those military merits of his Lordship, which rendered him respected in his lifetime, are now regretted 
by the whole army. It will doubtless be a soothing 
consideration in the poignancy of your grief, to find, 
that the general officers are going into mourning for him. 

Mrs. Washington joins me in requesting, that your 
Ladyship and Lady Kitty will be assured, that we feel the tenderest sensibility on this melancholy occasion. 
With sentiments of perfect esteem and respect, I am 
your Ladyship's most obedient and humble servant.

TO ELIAS BOUDINOT, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 30 January, 1783. 

Sir, 

I should not have undertaken at this time to address 
myself through your Excellency to Congress, on the 
present state of our military and political affairs, which 
are so blended as scarcely to admit of separation in the 
discussion, did I not apprehend that my silence might 
perhaps be construed into remissness in my official 
duties or inattention to the public interests, and that 
some inconvenience might be experienced by the neglect or delay. Influenced by these motives, and an 
ardent desire to carry the wishes of Congress into 
effect, I shall hope to be excused, after suggesting a 
few things, for entreating to be made acquainted, so far 
as may be deemed expedient, with their sentiments and 
expectations relative to our future operations. 

It scarcely needs be remarked here, as it is a fact 
of great notoriety, that the tranquillity, leisure, and inactivity of winter-quarters have ever been considered 
by all well informed warlike nations, when in a state 
of hostility, as the only proper season for taking into 
contemplation the probable operations of the ensuing 
campaign, and for making the best arrangements in their power tor carrying such projects as were finally determined upon into execution. It was not sini[»ly in conformity with tliis practice, but upon a perfect conviction 
of the propriety and expediency of it, that at the close 
of my former campaigns I have thought myself not 
only warranted, but impelled by the strongest ilictales 
of reason and duty, to exert all my inlluence and abilities in endeavouring to augment our force, and to make 
the greatest possible provision in every depai-tment for 
enabling us to act with vigor at the opening of the next 
campaign ; and, in thus attempting to perform my duty, 
I derived no small share of satisfaction from a consciousness, that I should meet with the approbation 
and assistance of my country ; being at the same time 
so fully acquainted with the designs of the enemy on 
the one hand, and with the inclinations of Congress on 
the other, that I could not hesitate a moment in my 
own mind to decide what general system of measures 
was proper to be adopted. But, as the complexion 
of our political and military atfairs is now entirely 
changed by the negotiations for peace, which are carrying on in Europe ; as Congress have determined by 
the reduction which has lately taken place, that the 
number of men engaged on the present establishment 
is adequate to the services before us ; and as that honorable body have much better opportunities, than any 
individual can have, for collecting and comparing the 
intelligence necessary to judge, with a degree of certainty, whether peace will be concluded in the course 
of the winter, so as to supersede the necessity of any 
further military preparations ; I could not think myself 
at liberty, without having recourse to their sentiments, 
to take the same measures and give the same orders, 
that I had on all former occasions deemed myself competent to do. On the contrary, I feared to delay any longer to express my apprehensions, that very fair opportunities might be lost, anil that very great, if not 
irreparable injuries might be experienced, (if the war 
should be continued, especially if it should begin to rage 
again,) in case we should not also on our part be in a 
state of preparation for such an event. 

In addition to every other consideration of a foreign, 
a military, or political nature, the embarrassed state of 
our finances, the necessity of using the strictest economy and preventing every unnecessary expenditure of 
public money in conducting our military affairs, have 
in an especial manner prompted me to make this representation, that the sovereign power may determine, 
what is the proper line of conduct to be pursued under 
our present circumstances ; whether any and what 
preparations ought to be made during the winter ; and 
what our situation wUl be at the period proper for opening the campaign (supposing the war should continue 
and require any defensive operations on our part), unless many of the essential articles which are wanting, 
particularly in the quartermaster's department, should 
in the mean time be effectually and fully supplied. 
Amongst the most indispensable and yet most expensive of which, I must beg leave to mention the 
means of transportation, namely, horses for artillery, 
and teams and wheel-carriages for ordnance, stores, and 
baggage ; without which, it is well known, an army 
becomes perfectly harmless and perfectly helpless ; for, 
so far from being able to annoy and operate against its 
enemy, it is neither able to take the field, nor to advance or retire a single step, let the occasions or prospects be of a nature ever so pressing and important. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing observations, I hope it 
will be clearly understood, that it is very far from being 
my wish or desire, that our military preparations should be increased in the smallest degree beyond what the 
exigence of the eircunistanccs may appear to deinanil. 
But, while I candidly confess, that I believe there is no 
in:ui, who more earnestly wishes a speedy period may 
be put to the contest than myself, I must take the liberty to suggest, whether, in case a peace should not 
take place in consequence of the present negotiations, it 
would not be far more eligible in point of national policy 
and economy to attempt, by one great and decisive effort, to expel the enemy from the remaining part of their 
possessions in the United States, than to sulTer them 
with their enl'eebled force to liold a post and protract the 
war, until the accumulating expenses of our languid and 
defensive measures shall amount to such an aggregate 
sum, as would have furnished the means of attempting 
tlie siege of New York with a prospect of success? 

In order that your Excellency and Congress may 
have a comprehensive and complete view of our efficient force, our military apparatus, and the principal 
articles, which would be required for a vigorous campaign, I have thought it expedient to forward the enclosed returns and estimates (the estimate of the engineer being omitted, because the articles in his department will be principally provided by the labors of the 
armv) ; and I flatter myself it will be found, that the 
troops under my orders are at this moment as much 
collected and as well appointed, as could possibly be 
expected under our circumstances ; and that all the 
means, which have been afforded, so far as depended 
on military arrangements, have been economized in the 
most prudent manner. I wait with great solicitude to hear the sentiments, expectations, and final pleasure 
of Congress, on the several points contained in this 
letter ; and, in the mean time, 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Newburg, 6 February, 1783. 

My DEAR Sir, 

It is with a pleasure, which friendship only is susceptible of, that I congratulate you on the glorious end 
you have put to hostilities in the southern States. The 
honor and advantage of it, I hope and trust you will 
long live to enjoy. When this hemisphere will be 
equally free, is yet in the womb of time to discover. 
A httle while, it is presumed, will disclose the determinations of the British senate with respect to peace or 
war, as it seems to be agreed on all hands, that the 
present premier, especially if he should lind the opposition powerful, intends to submit the decision of these 
matters to Parliament. The speech, the addresses, and debates, for which we are looking in every direction, 
will give data, IVoni which the l)iii;lit rays of the one or 
the gloomy prospect of tiie otiier may be discovered. 
If historiographers should he hardy enough to fill the 
page of history with the advantages, that have been 
gained with unequal numbers, on the part of America 
in the course of this contest, and attempt to relate the 
distressing circumstances under which they have been 
obtained, it is more than probable, that posterity will 
bestow on their labors the epithet and marks of fiction ; 
for it will not be believed, that such a force as Great 
Britain has employed for eight years in this country 
could be ballled in their plan of subjugating it, by numbers infinitely less, composed of men oftentimes half 
starved, always in rags, without pay, and experiencing 
at times every species of distress, which human nature 
is capable of undergoing. 

I intended to write you a long letter on sundry 
matters ; but Major Burnet came in unexpectedly at a 
time, when I was preparing for the celeliration of the 
day, and was just going to a review of tiie troops, 
previous to the feu dc joic As he is impatient, from 
an apprehension that the sleighing may tail, and as he 
can give you the occurrences of this quarter more in 
detail than I have time to do, I will refer you to him. 
I cannot omit informing you, however, that I let no opportunity slip to inquire after your son George at Princeton, and that it is with pleasure I hear he enjoys good health and is a fine, promising boy. With 
great truth and sincerity, and every sentiment of friendship, I am, &,c.

TO JOSEPH JOJVES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 11 February, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I am about to write you a letter on a subject equally 
important and delicate, which may be extensive in its 
consequences and serious in its nature. I shall confine 
myself to the recital of what I believe to be facts, and 
leave it with you to make deductions. 

The printed remonstrance of Mr. Chittenden and his 
Council, addressed to the president of Congress and 
founded upon the resolves of the 5th of December 
last, contains a favorable recital in their own behalf, of 
what I suppose to be facts ; but, if my memory serves 
me, it is an uncandid performance, inasmuch as it keeps 
out of view an important transaction of theirs, which 
was consequent on those resolves. Be this as it may, 
matters seem to be approaching too fast to a disagreeable issue, for the quiet of my mind. The resolves on 
one hand, and the remonstrance on the other, unless 
it should be annulled by the legislature at their next 
meeting, which I do not expect, seem to leave litde 
room for an amicable decision. 

Affairs being thus situated, permit me to ask how far, 
and by what means, coercion is to be extended ? The 
army, I presume, will be the answer to the latter. Circumstances (for there can be no determination after blood is once drawn) alone can prescribe bounds to the 
fornuT. It lias been said, Imt of this you can juilge 
bolter than I, that the delegates from the New England 
States in Congress, or a niajority of thc^ni, are willing 
to admit these people into liie Federal Union, as an independent and sovereign State. Be this as it may, two 
things I am sure of, namely, that they have a powerful 
interest in those States, and pursued very politic measures to strengthen and increase it, long before I liatl any 
knowledge of the matter, and before the tendency of it 
was seen into or suspected, by granting upon very advantageous terms large tracts of land, in which, I am sorry to find, the army in some degree have participattul. 

Let me next ask, by whom is that district of country 
principally settled? And of whom is your present army 
(I do not confine the question to this part of it, but 
will extend it to the whole) composed? The answers 
are evident, — New England men. It has been the 
opinion of some, that the appearance of force would 
awe these people into submission. If the General Assembly ratify and confirm what Mr. Chittenden and his 
Council have done, I shall be of a very different sentiment ; and, moreover, that it is not a trilling force that 
will subdue them, even supposing they derive no aid 
from the enemy in Canada ; and that it would be a 
very arduous task indeed, if they should, to say nothing 
of a diversion, which may and doubdess Wduld he made 
in their favor from New York, if the war with Great 
Britain should continue. 

The country is very mountainous, full of defiles, and 
extremely strong. The inhabitants, for the most part, 
are a hardy race, composed of that kind of people, 
who are best calculated for soldiers ; in truth, who are 
soldiers ; for many, many hundreds of them are deserters from this army, who, having acquired property 
there, would be desperate in the defence of it, well knowing that they were fighting with halters about their necks. 

It may be asked, if I am acquainted with the sentiments of the army on the subject of this dispute. I 
readily answer, No, not intimately. It is a matter of 
too delicate a nature to agitate for the purpose of information. But I have heard many officers of rank and 
discernment, and have learned by indirect inquiries 
that others, express the utmost horror at the idea of 
shedding blood in this dispute ; comparing it in its consequences, though not in its principles, to the quarrel 
with Great Britain, who thought she was only to hold 
up the rod and all would be hushed. I cannot at this 
time undertake to say, that there would be any difficulty 
with the army, if it were to be ordered upon this service, but I should be exceedingly unhappy to see the 
experiment. For, besides the reasons before suggested, 
I believe there would be a great and general unwillingness to embrue their hands in the blood of their brethren. I have to add, that almost at the same instant a 
number of the printed copies of the remonstrance were 
disseminated through the army. What effect it will 
have, I know not. The design is obvious. 

I promised in the beginning of this letter, that I 
should content myself with a simple relation of facts. 
I shall only lament, therefore, that Congress did not 
in the commencement of this dispute act decidedly. 
This matter, as you well know, was much agitated last 
winter, and a committee of Congress, with whom I had 
the honor to be in conference, and of which I believe 
you were one, approved of my writing an answer to the 
effect it was given. With great regard, I am, &c.

VO Tin: I'KESIUK.NT OF CONGRKSS. 

Head-Quarters, Nowburg, 25 February, 173. 

Sir, 

I am sorry to acquaint your Excellency, for the inlorniation of Congress, that a project, which I had formed for attacking the enemy's post at Oswego, as soon 
as the sleighing should be good and the ice of the 
Oneida Lake should have acquired suflicient thickness 
to admit the passage of the detachment, has miscarried. 
The report of Colonel Willett, to wliom I had entrusted 
the command of the pai-ty, consisting of a pai-t of the 
Rhode Island regiment, and the State troops of New 
York, in all about five hundred men, will assign reasons 
for the disappointment. 

Although the expedition has not been attended with success, the officers and soldiers employed on it are 
entitled to great credit for the spirit, activity, and patience exhibited by them in the course of the attempt; 
and, I am certain, nothing that depended upon Colonel Willett to give efficacy to it was wanting. 

Major Tallmadge, whom I had placed contiguous to the purpose of interrupting as much as possible on 
that side the trade with New York, has been more successful, as will appear by his report, a copy of which 
is likewise enclosed. The zeal and activity of Major Tallmadge, and the promptness and braveiy of the 
party acting under his orders on this occasion, have 
merited and received my thanks. The detachments 
also belonging to the command of Brigadier-General Hazen, which are occasionally advanced to Bergen, 
Newark, and Elizabethtown, to intercept the illicit commerce in that quarter, appear to have been very alert, 
and they have succeeded in several instances. I flatter myself Congress will be persuaded, that nothing on 
my part has been omitted to carry fully into execution 
the resolution of the 30th of October last.t But at 
the same time I am under the necessity of declaring, 
in my own vindication, that, unless the civil powers of 
the different States will adopt the most energetic measures, and make the greatest exertions to carry them 
into effect, it will be impossible to put a stop to an 
evil, which has increased to an alarming height, and 
which, notwithstanding all our efforts, is still increasing, and, I am informed, prevails nowhere in such an 
uncontrolled manner as on the seacoast of Connecticut. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO LIKirrK.VAXT-COLONKl. WILLIA.M S. SMITH. 

Ncwburg, 3 March, 1783. 

Dkau Silt, 

It is imirli to be regretted, that, while I am using 
every means in my power to comply with the orders 
of Congress, founded in my judgment on our true interest and policy, there should be such a counteraction as we daily experience from individuals. But lamentable indeed is our situation, when States, or the 
administration of them, are leaping over those bounds, 
which should ever be deemed the sacred barrier between us and the enemy, without which all opposition to their measures must soon cease, or dwindle 
into something ridiculous. 

That the intercourse with New York by way of the 
Sound is in a manner without restriction, I have little 
doubt ; and that the very boats, which are armed and 
commissioned for the purpose of cutting off the communication, are employed in facilitating the trade, I 
have a recent instance in one caught by INIajor Tallmadge in the act and with the goods on board. We 
have only to persevere, and with the means that we 
possess give all the checks to it in our power. Every officer, who exerts himself in this business, will 
meet all the support I can give, and will undoubtedly 
merit the apj)rohati()n of Congress. 

With respect to the other matters contained in your 
letter,t I have to entreat, that you will keep an attentive eye towards them, and that you may be able to 
give me the best information respecting them, when 
required, that the nature of the case will admit. Let 
the motives to these inquiries be hidden from those 
about you, and confined to yom- own breast. I have 
reasons for giving you this caution, but cannot entrust 
them to paper. I am, &c.

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 4 March, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your favor of February, and thank 
you for the information and observations which it has 
conveyed to me. I shall always think myself obliged 
by a free communication of sentiments, and have often 
thought, but suppose I thought wrong, as it did not accord with the practice of Congress, that the public interest might be benefited if the Commander-in-chief of 
the army were let more into the political and pecuniary 
state of our affairs than he is. Enterprises, and the 
adoption of military and other arrangements, that might 
be exceedingly proper in some circumstances, would be 
altogether improper in others. It follows, then, by a fair 
deduction, that, where there is a want of information, there must be a chance-medley ; and a man may be upon the brink of a precipice before he is aware of his 
(laiif^tT, when a little tbrcknowletif^c might enable him 
to avoid it. But this hy the \>y. 

The hint contained in your letter, and the knowledge 
I have derived from the public gazettes, respecting the 
non-payment of taxes, contains ;J1 the information which 
I have received of the danger, that stares us in tiie 
face on account of our funds ; and, so far was I from 
conceiving, that our finances were in so deplorable a 
state at this time, that I had imbibed ideas from some 
source of information or other, that, with the prospect 
of a loan from Holland, we should be able to rub along 
yet a little further. 

To you, who have seen the danger, to which the 
army has been exposed, of a political dissolution for 
want of subsistence, and the unhappy spirit of licentiousness, which it imbibed by becoming in one or two 
instances its own provider, no observations are necessary to evince the fatal tendency of such a measure ; 
but I shall give it as my opinion, that it would at this 
day be productive of civil commotions and end in blood. 
Unhappy situation this ! God forbid we should be involved in it. 

The predicament, in which I stand as a citizen and 
soldier, is as critical and delicate as can well be conceived. It has been the subject of many contemplative 
hours. The sufferings of a complaining army on one 
hand, and the inability of Congress and tardiness of 
the States on the other, are the forebodings of evil, 
and may be productive of events, which are more to 
be deprecated than prevented. But I am not without 
hope, if there is such a disposition shown, as prudence 
and policy will dictate, to do justice, that your apprehensions in case of peace are greater than there is 
cause for. In this, however, I may be mistaken, if 
those ideas, which you have been informed are propagating in the army, should be extensive ; the source of 
which may be easily traced, as the old leaven it is said, 
for I have no proof of it, is again beginning to work 
under a mask of the most perfect dissimulation and apparent cordiality. 

Be these things as they may, I shall pursue the same 
steady line of conduct, which has governed me hitherto ; fully convinced, that the sensible and discerning 
pai-t of the army cannot be unacquainted, although I 
never took pains to inform them, with the services I 
have rendered it on more occasions than one. This, 
and pursuing the suggestions in your letter, which I am 
happy to find coincide with my practice for several 
months past (which has turned the business of the army into the channel where it now is), leave me under no great apprehension of its exceeding the bounds 
of reason and moderation, notwithstanding the prevailing sentiment is, that the prospect of compensation for 
past services will terminate with the war. 

The just claims of the army ought, and it is to be 
hoped will have their weight with every sensible legislature in the United States, if Congress point to their demands, and show, if the case is so, the reasonableness of 
them, and the impracticability of complying with them 
without their aid. In any other point of view, it would 
in my opinion be impolitic to introduce the army on 
the tapis, lest it should excite jealousy and bring on its 
concomitants. The States cannot surely be so devoid 
of common sense, common honesty, and common policy, as to refuse their aid on a full, clear, and candid 
representation of facts from Congress ; more especially 
if these should be enforced by members of their own 
body, who might demonstrate what the inevitable consequences of failure will lead to. 

In my opinion it is a matter worthy of consideration, how far an adjournment of Congress for a few 
months is ailvisahle. The tielegates in lliat case, if 
they are in union themselves respecting the great defects of our constitution, may represent them fully and 
boldly to their constituents. To me, who know nothing 
of the business which is l)efore Congress, nor of the 
arcamx, it appears that such a measure would tend to 
promote the public weal ; for it is clearly my o{)inion, 
unless Congress have powers competent to all general 
purposes, that the distresses we have encfunitered, the 
expense we have incurred, and the blood we have spilt, 
will avail us nothing. 

The contents of your letter are known only to myself. Your pruilence will be at no loss to know what 
use to make of these sentiments. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

Head-Quarters, 7 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

While applications are making in favor of others, I 
cannot refrain from mentioning to Congress the case 
of Colonel Armand with respect to promotion. Justice 
to that gentleman obliges me to express the esteem I 
have of him, as an intelligent, active, and very deserving officer ; one who has been zealous in the service 
of the United States, and who, I am persuaded, has 
expended considerable sums for the establishment of 
his corps, which he probably will be a considerable 
time out of, if he expects to be refunded. 

I take particular pleasure in pointing the attention 
of Congress to Colonel Armand, as his character and 
merits have gained my respect, and his promotion, I think, may take place without inconvenience, he being 
among the oldest colonels in the service of the United 
States. I am, &c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 12 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

It is with inexpressible concern I make the following report to your Excellency. Two days ago, anonymous notifications were circulated in the army, requesting a general meeting of the olRcers the next day. 
A copy of one of these papers is enclosed. About 
the same time, another anonymous writing, purporting 
to be an address to the officers of the army, was 
handed about in a clandestine manner. It is also enclosed. To prevent any precipitate and dangerous 
resolutions from being taken at this perilous moment, 
while the passions were all inflamed, as soon as these 
things had come to my knowledge the next morning, 
I issued the enclosed order. In this situation the affair now rests. 

As all opinion must be suspended until after the 
meeting on Saturday next, I have nothing further to 
add, except a wish that the measure I have taken to ' 
dissipate a storm, which had gathered so suddenly and 
unexpectedly, may be acceptable to Congress ; and to 
assure them that, in every vicissitude of circumstances, 
still actuated with the greatest zeal in their service, I shall continue my utmost exertions to promote the 
WL'lt'aro of my cuuutry, under the ino>t lively expectation, that Congress have the best intention of doing 
ample justice to the army as soon as circumstances 
will possibly ailinil. I Ikuc the honor to be, &,c.

TO JOSKl'H JO.VES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 12 March, 1783 

Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 26th ultimo, and 
thank you for your information and the freedom of your 
communications. My ollicial letter to Congress of this 
date will inform you of what has happened in this quarter ; in addition to which, it may be necessary that it 
should be known to you, and to such others as you 
may think proper, that the army, though very irritable 
on account of their long protracted sufferings, have 
been apparently extremely quiet while their business 
was depending before Congress, until four days past. 
In the mean time, it should seem, reports have been 
propagated in Philadelphia, that dangerous combinations were forming in the army ; and this at a time, 
when there was not a syllable of the kind in agitation in camp. 

It also appears, that, upon the arrival of a certain 
gentleman from Philadelphia in camp, whose name at 
present I do not incline to mention, such sentiments as 
these were immediately and industriously circulated ; 
that it was universally expected the army would not disband until they had obtained justice ; that the public 
creditors looked up to them for redress of their grievances, would afford them every aid, and even join them 
in the field if necessary ; that some members of Congress wished the measure might take eifect, in order 
to compel the public, particularly the delinquent States, 
to do justice ; with many other suggestions of a similar nature. From whence, and a variety of other considerations, it is generally believed, that the scheme was 
not only planned but also digested and matured in 
Philadelphia, and that some people have been playing 
a double game, spreading at the camp and in Philadelphia reports, and raising jealousies, equally void of 
foundation, until called into being by their vile artifices ; for, as soon as the minds of the army were 
thought to be prepared for the transaction, anonymous 
invitations were circulated, requesting a general meeting 
of the officers the next day. At the same instant many copies of the address to the officers of the army 
were scattered in every State line of it. 

So soon as I obtained a knowledge of these things, 
I issued the order of the 11th, transmitted to Congress, 
in order to rescue the foot, that stood wavering on the 
precipice of despair, from taking those steps, which 
would have led to the abyss of misery, while the passions were inflamed and the mind tremblingly alive 
with the recollection of past sufferings, and with present feelings. I did this upon the principle, that it is 
easier to divert from a wrong to a right path, than to 
recall the hasty and fatal steps, that have been already 
taken. 

It is comiuDiily supposed, that, if the officers had 
met agreeably to the anonymous summons, resolutions 
might have been formed, tiie consecjuences of whicli 
may be more easily conceived than expressed. Now 
they will have leisure to view the matter more calmly 
and seriously. It is to be hoped, that they will be induced to ailopt more rational measures, and wait a 
whiK- loiiL^ir for the settlement of their accounts, the 
postponing of which gives more uneasiness in the army 
than any other thing. There is not a man in it, who 
will not acknowletlge that Congress have not the means 
of payment; but why not, say they one and all, Tujuidate the accounts and certify our dues? Are we to 
be disbanded and sent home without this ? Are we 
afterwards lo make individual applications for such settlements at Philadelphia, or any auditing ofllce in our 
respective States ; to be shifted perhaps from one 
board to another, dancing attendance at all, and finally 
postponed till we lose the substance in pursuit of the 
shadow ? While they are agitated by these considerations, there are not wanting insidious characters, who 
tell them it is neither the wish nor the intention of the 
public to settle their accounts ; but to delay this business under one pretext or another, until peace, which 
we are on the eve of, and a separation of the army 
takes place ; when, it is well known, a general settlement never can be effected, and that individual loss 
in this instance becomes public gain. 

However derogatory these ideas are to the dignity, 
honor, and justice of the government, yet when a matter 
so interesting to the army, and at the same time so easy 
to be effected by the public, as that of liquidating the 
accounts, is delayed without any apparent or obvious 
necessity, they will have their place in a mind that is 
soured and irritated. Let me entreat you, therefore my good Sir, to push this matter to an issue ; and, if 
there are delegates among you, who are really opposed 
to doing justice to the army, scruple not to tell them, 
if matters should come to extremity, that they must 
be answerable for all the ineffable horrors, which may 
be occasioned thereby. I am most sincerely and affectionately yours.

Head-Quarters, 16 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to inform your Excellency, for the 
satisfaction of Congress, that the meeting of the officers, which was mentioned in my last, was held yesterday ; and that it has terminated in a manner, which 
I had reason to expect, from a knowledge of that good 
sense and steady patriotism of the gentlemen of the 
army, which on frequent occasions I have discovered. 
The report of the meeting, with the other papers, 
which will be necessary to accompany it, I shall do 
myself the honor to transmit to Congress, as soon as 
they can possibly be prepared. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO THE president OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, Newburg, 18 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

The result of the proceedings of the grand convention of officers, which I have the honor of enclosing 
to your Excellency for the inspection of Congress, will, 
I flatter myself, be considered as the last glorious proof of patriotism, which could have been given by 
men, who aspired to the distinction of a patriot army, 
anil will not only confnm their clain\ to tiie justice, 
but will increase their title to the gratitude, of their 
country. 

Having seen the proceedings on the part of the army terminate witli perfect unanimity, and in a manner 
entirely consonant to my wishes ; being impressed with 
the liveliest sentiments of affection for those, who have 
so long, so patiently, and so cheerfully suffered and 
fought under my immediate direction ; having from motives of justice, duty, and gratitude, spontaneously offered myself as an advocate for their rights ; and having been requested to write to your Excellency, earnestly entreating the most speedy decision of Congress 
upon the subjects of the late address from the army 
to that honorable body ; it now only remains for me 
to perform the task I have assumed, and to intercede 
in their behalf, as I now do, that the sovereign power 
will be pleased to verify the predictions I have pronounced, and the confidence the army have reposed 
in the justice of their country. 

And here I humbly conceive it is altogether unnecessary, while I am pleading the cause of an army, 
which has done and suffered more than any other army ever did in the defence of the rights and hberties 
of human nature, to expatiate on their claims to the 
most ample compensation for their meritorious services ; 
because they are perfectly known to the whole world, 
and because, although the topics are inexhaustible, 
enough has already been said on the subject. 

To prove these assertions, to evince that my sentiments have ever been uniform, and to show what my 
ideas of the rewards in question have always been, I 
appeal to the archives of Congress, and call on those 
sacred deposits to witness for me ; and, in order that 
my observations and arguments in favor of a future 
adequate provision for the officers of the army may be 
brought to remembrance again, and considered in a single point of view, without giving Congress the trouble 
of having recourse to their files, I will beg leave to 
transmit herewith an extract from a representation 
made by me to a committee of Congress, so long ago 
as the 29th of January, 1778, and also the transcript 
of a letter to the President of Congress, dated near 
Passaic Falls, October Uth, 1780. That, in the critical and perilous moment when the last mentioned communication was made, there was the utmost danger 
that a dissolution of the army would take place, unless measures similar to these recommended had been 
adopted, will not admit a doubt. That the adoption 
of the resolution, granting half-pay for life, has been 
attended with all the happy consequences I had foretold, so far as respected the good of the service, let 
the astonishing contrast between the state of the army 
at this instant, and at the former period, determine ; and 
that the establishment of funds and securides, for the 
payment of all the just demands of the army, will be 
the most certain means of preserving the national faith, 
and the future tranquillity of this extensive continent, is 
my decided opinion. 

By the preceding remarks it will readily be imagined, 
that, instead of retracting and reprehending, from farther experience and reflection, the mode of compensation so strenuously urged in the enclosures, I am more and more conlirincd in the sentiment ; :uul, il' in the 
wrong, siiUcr me to please mysell" witli the grateful delusion. For if, besides the simple payment of their 
wages, a farther compensation is not due to the sufferings and sacrifices of the oflicers, then have I been 
mistaken indeed. If the whole army have not merited 
Avhatever a grateful people can bestow, then have I 
been beguiled by prejudice, and built opinion on the 
basis of error. If this country should not in the event 
perform every thing, which has been requested in the 
late memorial to Congress, then will my belief become 
vain, and the hope, that has been excited, void of 
foundation. And if, as has been suggested, for the 
purpose of inflaming their passions, " the othcers of the 
iU'my tu'e to be the only sullerers by this revolution ; if, 
retirmg from the field, they are to grow old in poverty, wretchedness, and contempt ; if they are to wade 
through the vile mire of dependency, and owe the 
miserable remnant of that life to charity, vshich has 
hitherto been spent in honor;" then shall I have learned what ingratitude is, then shall I have realized a 
tale, which will embitter every moment of my future 
life. But I am under no such apprehensions. A country, rescued by their arms from impending ruin, will 
never leave unpaid the debt of gratitude. 

Should any intemperate or improper warmth have 
mingled itself in the foregoing observations, I must entreat your Excellency and Congress, that it may be 
attributed to the effusion of an honest zeal in the best 
of causes, and that my peculiar situation may be my 
apology ; and I hope I need not, on this momentous 
occasion, make any new protestations of personal disinterestedness, having ever renounced for myself the 
idea of pecuniary reward. The consciousness of having attempted faithfully to discharge my duty, and the approbation of my country, will be a sufficient recompense for my services. I have the honor to be, with 
perfect respect, &c.

TO JOSEPH JOJVES, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 18 Marcli, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

The storm, which seemed to be gathering with unfavorable prognostics when I wrote to you last, is dispersed, and we are again in a state of tranquillity. But 
do not suffer this appearance of tranquillity to relax 
your endeavours to bring the requests of the army to 
an issue. Believe me, the officers are too much pressed by their present wants, and rendered too sore by 
the recollection of their past sufferings, to be touched 
much longer upon the string of forbearance, in a matter 
wherein they can see no cause for delay ; nor would 
I have further reliance placed upon any influence of 
mine to dispel other clouds, if any should arise from 
the causes of the last. 

By my official letter to Congress, and the papers 
enclosed in it, you will have a full view of my assurances to, and the expectations of, the army ; and I persuade myself, that the well-wishers to both and to their 
country will exert themselves to the utmost to eradicate the seeds of distrust, and give every satisfaction 
that justice requires, and the means which Congress 
possess will enable them to do. 

In a former letter I observed to you, that a liquidation of accounts, in order that the balances might be 
ascertained, is the great object of the army ; and certainly nothing can be more reasonable. To have the 
balances discharged at this or in any short time, however desirable, they know is impracticable, and do not 
expect it ; ;illliougli in the meaii time they must laiior 
under the pressure of these sufferings, which is felt 
more sensibly by a comparison of circumstances. 

The situation of these gentlemen merits the attention of every thinking and grateful mind. As ollicers, 
they have been ohlii^ed to dress and appeal- in character, to effect wliicii they have been oblii^ed to anticipate their pay, or ilraw from their estates. By the 
former, debts have been contracted ; i)y the latter, their 
patrimony is injured. To disband men, therefore, under these circumstances, before their accounts are liquidated imd the balances ascertained, woukl be to set 
open the doors of the jails, and then to shut them upon seven years' faithful and painful services. Under 
any circumstances, which the nature of the case will 
admit, they must be considerable sullerers ; because 
necessity will compel them to part with their certificates for whatever they will fetch, to avoid the evils 
I have mentioned above ; and how much this will 
place them in the hands of unfeeling, avaricious speculators, a recurrence to past experience will suiliciently 
prove. 

It may be said by those, who have no disposition to 
compensate the services of the army, that the oliicers 
have too much penetration to place dependence, in 
any alternative, upon the strength of their own arm. 
I will readily concede to those gentlemen, that no good 
could result from such an attempt ; but I hope they 
will be equally candid in acknowledging, that much 
mischief may (low from it ; and that nothing is to be 
expected from men, who conceive they are ungratefully and unjustly dealt by ; especially too, if they can 
suppose that characters are not wanting to foment every passion, which leads to discord, and that there are 
— but time shall reveal the rest. 

Let it suffice, that the very attempt would imply a 
want of justice, and fix an indelible stain upon our 
national chai-acter ; since the whole world, as well from 
the enemy's publications (without any intendon to serve 
us), as our own, must be strongly impressed with the 
sufferings of this army from hunger, cold, and nakedness, in almost every stage of the war. Very sincerely 
and affectionately, I am, &c.

Head-Quarters, 19 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to acknowledge your Excellency's 
favor of the 12th instant, and to thank you most sincerely for the intelligence you were pleased to communicate. The articles of treaty between America 
and Great Britain are as full and as satisfactory as we 
had reason to expect ; but, from the connexion in 
which they stand with a general pacification, they are 
very inconclusive and contingent. From this circumstance, compared with such other intelligence as I have 
been able to collect, I must confess, I have my fears 
that we shall be obliged to worry through another 
campaign before we arrive at that happy period, which 
is to crown all our toils. 

Any intelligence from your Excellency will be at 
all times very agreeable to mc. But, should it be in 
your power to announce a general peace, you could 
not make me more happy than by ilie conmmnication 
of such an event. I have the Iiohdi- to be, &,c.

TO GOVERNOR HARRISON. 

Newburg, 19 March, 1783. 

Dkak Sir, 

About the first of this month I wrote you a long 
letter. I touched upon the state of the army and the 
situation of public creditors, and wished to know from 
you as a friend, what causes had induced the Assembly 
of Virginia to withdraw their assent to the impost law, 
and how the Continental creditors without adequate 
funds were to come at or obtain security for their 
money. I little expected at the time of writing that 
letter, that we were on the eve of an important crisis to this army, when the touchstone of discord was 
to be applied, and the virtue of its members to undergo the severest trial. 

You have not been altogether unacquainted, I dare 
say, with the fears, the hopes, the apprehensions, and 
the expectations of the army, relative to the provision, 
which is to be made for them hereafter. Although a 
firm reliance on the integrity of Congress, and a belief that the public would finally do justice lo all its 
servants and give an indisputable security for the payment of the half-pay of the ofiicers, had kept them 
amidst a variety of sufferings tolerably quiet and contented for two or three years past ; yet the total want 
of pay, the little prospect of receiving any from the 
unpromising state of the public finances, and the absolute aversion of the States to establish any Continental 
funds for the payment of the debt due to the army, 
did at the close of the last campaign excite greater 
discontents, and threaten more serious and alarming 
consequences, than it is easy for me to describe or you 
to conceive. Happily for us, the officers of highest 
rank and greatest consideration interposed ; and it was 
determined to address Congress in an humble, pathetic, 
and explicit manner. 

While the sovereign power appeared perfectly well 
disposed to do justice, it was discovered that the States 
would enable them to do nothing ; and in this state 
of affairs, and after some time spent on the business 
in Philadelphia, a report was made by the delegates of 
the army, giving a detail of the proceedings. Before 
this could be fully communicated to the troops, while 
the minds of all were in a peculiar state of inquietude 
and irritation, an anonymous writer, though he did 
not step forth and give his name boldly to the world, 
sent into circulation an address to the officers of the 
army, which, in point of composition, in elegance and 
force of expression, has rarely been equalled in the 
English language, and in which the dreadful alternative 
was proposed, of rehnquishing the service in a body, if 
the war continued, or retaining their arms in case of 
peace, until Congress should comply with all their demands. At the same time, and at the moment when 
their minds were inflamed by the most pathetic representations, a general meeting of the officers was summoned by another anonymous production. 

It is impossible to say what would have been the 
consequences, had the author succeeded in his first 
plans. But, measures having been taken to postpone 
the meeting, so as to give time for cool reflection and 
counteraction, the good sense of the officers has terminateil this alVair in a manner, which rellcct.s the greatest glory on themselves, and demands the highest expressions of gratitude from tiieir country. 

The proceedings have been reported to Congress, 
and will probably be published for the satisfaction of 
the people of these United States. In the mean time 
I thought it necessary to give you these particulars, 
principally with a design to communicate to you without reserve my opinion on this interesting subject 
For, notwithstanding the storm has now passed over, 
notwithstanding the officers have in despite of their 
accumulated suflferings given the most unequivocal and 
exalted proofs of patriotism, yet I believe, unless justice 
shall be done, and funds effectually provided for the 
payment of the debt, the most deplorable and ruinous 
consequences may be apprehended. Justice, honor, 
gratitude, policy, every thing is opposed to the conduct 
of driving men to despair of obtaining their just rights, 
after serving seven years a painful life in the field. I 
say in the field, because they have not during that period had any thing to shelter them from the inclemency 
of the seasons but tents, and such houses as they 
could build for themselves. 

Convinced of this, and actuated as I am, not by private and interested motives, but by a sense of duty, a 
love of justice, and all the feelings of gratitude towards 
a body of men, who have merited infinitely well of 
their country, I can never conceal or suppress my sentiments. I cannot cease to exert all the abilities I am 
possessed of, to show the evil tendency of procrastinated justice (for I will not suppose it is intended ultimately to withhold it), nor fail to urge the establishment of such adequate and permanent funds, as will 
enable Congress to secure the payment of the public 
debt, on such principles as will preserve the national faith, give satisfaction to the army, and tranquillity to 
the public. With great esteem and regard, I am, &,c. 

P. S. The author of the anonymous address is yet 
behind the curtain ; and, as conjecture may be grounded on error, I will not announce mine at present.

Head-Quarters, 10 March, 1783. 

Sir, 

I am exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for 
your communication of the 15th. The articles of treaty between America and Great Britain, as they stand 
in connexion with a general pacification, are so very 
inconclusive, that I am fully in sentiment with your 
Excellency, that we should hold ourselves in a hostile 
position, prepared for either alternative, peace or war. 
I shall confer with the Duke de Lauzun on the subjects you are pleased to mention ; and, as I have ever 
viewed the practice of the States in supplying the enemy in New York with the means of subsistence as 
a very pernicious one in its tendency, both to ourselves and our allies, you may depend upon me to 
exert every measure in my power to prevent it. 

I am at all times happy in receiving intelligence 
from your Excellency ; and, should it be in your power to announce a general peace, you cannot make a 
more pleasing communication to me. Persuaded of 
the pure and benevolent intentions, which animate the 
breast of his Most Christian Majesty, I am assured, if 
that happy event should not result from the present 
negotiation, that the failure will not rest on his part.

proofs of the zeal of this young nobleman, his attachment to the American cause, and his important services in it, to entertain a doubt of the proj)nety of his

The news of a general peace, which your Excellency has been so good as to announce to me, has 
filled my mind with inexpressible satisfaction ; and 
permit me to add, that the joy I feel on this great 
event is doubly enhanced by the very obliging manner in which you have been pleased to express your 
congratulations to me and to the army on this happy occasion. 

The part your Excellency has acted in the cause 
of America, and the great and benevolent share you 
have taken in the establishment of her independence, 
are deeply impressed in my mind, and will not be effaced from my remembrance, or that of the citizens 
of America. You will accept, Sir, my warmest acknowledgments and congratulations, with assurances 
that I shall always participate, with the highest pleasure, in every event, which contributes to your happiness and satisfaction. 

The articles of the general treaty do not appear so 
favorable to France, in point of territorial acquisitions, 
as they do to the other powers. But the magnanimous and disinterested scale of action, which that great 
nation has exhibited to the world during this war, and 
at the conclusion of peace, will insure to the King 
and nation that reputation, which will be of more consequence to them than every other consideration.

TO ALEXA.VDER HAMILTON, IX CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 31 March, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I have duly received your favors of the 17th and 24th ultimo. I rejoice most exceedingly that there is an end to our warfare, and that such a field is opening 
to our view, as will, with wisdom to direct the cultivation of it, make us a great, a respectable, and happy people ; but it must be improved by other means than 
State politics, and unreasonable jealousies and prejudices, or it requires not the second sight to see, that we shall be instruments in the hands of our enemies, 
and those European powers, who may be jealous of our greatness in union, to dissolve the confederation. But, to obtain this, although the way seems extremely plain, is not so easy. 

My wish to see the union of these States established upon liberal and permanent principles, and inclination to contribute my mite in pointing out the defects 
of the present constitution, are equally great. All my private letters have teemed with these sentiments, and, 
whenever this topic has been the subject of conversation, I have endeavoured to diffuse and enforce them ; 
but how far any further essay by me might be productive of the wished-for end, or appear to arrogate 
more than belongs to me, depends so much upon popular opinion, and the temper and dispositions of 
the people, that it is not easy to decide. I shall be obliged to you, however, for the thoughts, which you 
have promised me on this subject, and as soon as you can make it convenient. 

No man in the United States is or can be more deeply impressed with the necessity of a reform in our present confederation than myself. No man perhaps 
has felt the bad effects of it more sensibly ; for to the defects thereof, and want of power in Congress, may 
justly be ascribed the prolongation of the war, and consequently the expenses occasioned by it. More than half the perplexities I have experienced in the course 
of my command, and almost the whole of the difficulties and tlistivss of the army, have had their origin 
here. But still, the prejudices of some, the designs of otliers, and the mere machinery of the majority, make address and management necessary to give weight to 
opinions, which are to combat the doctrines of those diderent nhisses of men in the field of politics. 

I would have been more full on this subject, but the 
bearer (in the clothing department) is waiting. I wish 
you may understand what I have written. I am, &.c. 

P. S. The enclosed extract of a letter to Mr. Livingston I give you in confidence. I submit it to your 
consideration, fully persuaded, that you do not want 
inclination to gratify the Marquis's wishes, as far as is 
consistent with our national honor.

TO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Head-Quarters, 5 April, 1783. 

My DEAR Marquis, 
It is easier for you to conceive, than for me to express, the sensibility of my heart at the communications 
in your letter of the 5th of February from Cadiz. It 
is to these communications we are indebted for the only 
account yet received of a general pacification. INIy 
mind, upon the receipt of this intelligence, was instantly 
assailed by a thousand ideas, all of them contending for 
preeminence ; but, believe me, my dear friend, none 
could supplant, or ever will eradicate that gratitude, 
which has arisen from a lively sense of the conduct of 
your nation, and from my obligations to many of its 
illustrious characters (of whom, I do not mean to flatter, when I place you at the head), and from my admiration of the virtues of your august sovereign, who, 
at the same time that he stands confessed the father 
of his own people, and defender of American rights, has 
given the most exalted example of moderation in treating with his enemies. 

We are now an independent people, and have yet 
to learn political tactics. We are placed among the 
nations of the earth, and have a character to estabhsh ; 
but how we shall acquit ourselves, time must discover. 
The probability is (at least I fear it), that local or State 
politics will interfere too much with the more liberal and 
extensive plan of government, which wisdom and foresight, freed from the mist of prejudice, would dictate ; 
and that we shall be guilty of many blunders in treading this boundless theatre, before we shall have arrived 
at any perfection in this art ; in a word, that the experience, which is purchased at the price of difficulties 
and distress, will alone convince us, that the honor, 
power, and true interest of this country must be measured by a Continental scale, and that every departure 
therefrom weakens the Union, and may ultimately break 
the band which holds us together. To avert these 
evils, to form a new constitution, that will give consistency, stability, and dignity to the Union, and sufficient 
powers to the great council of the nation for general 
purposes, is a duty incumbent upon every man, who 
wishes well to his country, and will meet with my aid as 
far as it can be rendered in the private walks of life. 

The armament, which was preparing at Cadiz, and 
in which you were to have acted a distinguished part, 
would have carried such conviction with it, that it is not 
to be wondered at, that Great Britain should have been 
impressed with the force of such reasoning. To this 
cause, I am persuadctl, the peace is to be ascribed. 
Your soini; to Madrid from thence, instead of coming 
immediately to this country, is another instance, my 
dear Marquis, of your zeal for the American cause, and 
lays a fresh claim to the gratitude of her sons, who will 
at all times receive you with open arms. As no oHicial tlespatches are yet received, either at Philadelphia 
or New York, concerning the completion of the treaty, 
nor any measures taken for the reduction of the army, 
niv detention with it is quite uncertain. Where I may 
be, then, at the time of your intended visit, is too uncertain even for conjecture ; but nothing can be more 
true, than that the pleasure, with which I shall receive 
you, will be equal to your wishes. I shall be better 
able to determine then, than now, on the practical)ility 
of accompanying you to France, a country to which I 
shall ever feel a warm affection ; and, if I do not pay it 
that tribute of respect, which is to be derived from a 
visit, it may be ascribed with justice to any other cause, 
than a want of inclination, or the pleasure of going 
there under the auspices of your friendship. 

I have already observed, that the determination of 
Congress, if they have come to any, respecting the 
army, is yet unknown to me. But, as you wish to be 
informed of every thing that concerns it, I do, for your 
satisfaction, transmit authentic documents of some very 
interesting occurrences, which have happened within 
the last six months. But I ought first to premise, that, 
from accumulated sufferings and little or no prospect 
of relief, the discontents of the officers last fall put on 
the threatening appearance of a total resignation, till the 
business was diverted into the channel, which produced 
the address and petition to Congress, which stand first 
on the file herewith enclosed. I shall make no comment on these proceedings. To one so well acquainted 
with the sufferings of the American army as you are, 
it is unnecessary. It will be sufficient to observe, that 
the more its virtue and forbearance are tried, the more 
resplendent it appears. My hope is, that the military 
exit of this valuable class of the community will exhibit 
such a proof of amor patrice, as will do them honor 
in the page of history. 

These papers, with my last letter, which was intended to go by Colonel Gouvion, containing extensive 
details of military plans, will convey to you every information. If you should get sleepy and tired of reading them, recollect, for my exculpation, that it is in compliance with your request I have run into such prolixity. 
I made a proper use of the confidential part of your 
letter of the 5th of February. 

The scheme, my dear Marquis, which you propose 
as a precedent to encourage the emancipation of the 
black people in this country from that state of bondage 
in which they are held, is a striking evidence of the 
benevolence of your heart. I shall be happy to join 
you in so laudable a work ; but will defer going into a detail of the business, till I liavu the pleasure of seeing you. 

Lord Stirling is no more. He ilifd at Albany in 
January last, very much regretted. Colonel Barber 
was snatched from us, about the same time, in a way 
eciualiy unexpected, sudden, antl distressing ; leaving 
many friends to bemoan his fate. 

Tilghman is on the point of matrimony \vitii a namesake and cousin, sister to Mrs. Carroll of Baltimore. It 
only remains for me now, my dear Marquis, to make a 
tender of my respectful compliments, in which Mrs. 
Washington unites, to Madame de Lafayette, and to 
wish you, her, and your little offspring, all the happiness this life can afford. I will extend my compliments to the gentlemen in your circle, with whom I 
have the honor of an acquaintance. I need not add 
how happy I shall be to see you in America, and more 
particularly at Mount Vernon, or with what truth and 
warmth of aflection I am, &,c.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Head-Quarters, 9 April, 1783. 

Sir, 
I feel great satisfaction from your Excellency's despatches bv Captain Stapleton, conveying to me the joyful annunciation of your having received official accounts of the conclusion of a general peace, and a cessation of hostihties. Without official authority from 
Congress, but perfectly relying on your communication, 
I can at this time only issue my orders to the American 
out-posts, to suspend all acts of hostilities until further 
orders. This shall be instantly done ; and I shall be 
happy in the momentary expectation of having it in 
my power to publish to the American army a general 
cessation of all hostilities between Great Britain and 
America. 

To your observations respecting particular articles 
of the peace I am obliged to reply, that it rests with 
Congress to direct measures for the observance of all 
the articles contained in the provisional treaty. You 
may be assured, that, as soon as I i-eceive my instructions from the sovereign power of the United States, 
I shall rejoice in giving every facility in my power to 
carry into complete execution that article of the treaty, 
which respects the restitution of all prisoners of war, 
being perfectly disposed to contribute to diffusing, as 
much as possible, the happy effects of this great event. 

I thank your Excellency for the assurances you are 
pleased to express, of your readiness to cultivate that 
spirit of perfect good will and conciliation, which you 
wish would take place between the King of Great 
Britain and the United States, and the citizens and 
subjects of both countries ; and I beg, Sir, that you 
will please to accept a tender from me of reciprocal 
good will and attention, accompanied with sincere congratulaUons on this joyful restoration of peace and general tranquillity, with an earnest wish, that, resting on the firm basis of mutual intorrst and good will, it may 
prove as lasting as it is happy. 

I have the honor to he, &,c.

My dear Baro.v, 

A committee of Congress is appointed to consider 
what arrangements it will be proper to adopt in the 
dilferent depai-tments with reference to a peace. Colonel Hamilton, who is chairman of this committee, has 
written to me on this subject, wishing to know my 
sentiments at large on such institutions of every kind 
for the interior defence of these States, as may be 
best adapted to their circumstances, and conciliate security with economy and with the principles of our 
government 

I wish, therefore, to be favored with your thoughts 
on this su!)ject, as soon as possible, that I may compare 
them with my own, and be able to comply with the 
request of the committee, in as full a manner and with 
as little delay as can be. I am, &,c.

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON, IN CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 16 April, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

My last letter to you was written in a hurry, when I 
was fatigued by the more public yet confidential letter, 
which, with several others, accompanied it. Possibly I 
did not on that occasion express myself, in what I intended as a hint, with so much perspicuity as I ought. 
Possibly, too, what I then dropped might have conveyed more than I intended, for I do not now recollect 
the force of my expressions. 

My meaning, however, was only to inform you, that 
there were different sentiments in the army, as well as 
in Congress, respecting Continental and State funds, 
some wishing to be thrown upon their respective States, 
rather than the continent at large, for payment ; and 
that, if an idea should generally prevail, that Congress, 
or part of its members or ministers, bent upon the latIcr, slioulil ilclay doing tlicin justice, or liazard il in 
pursuit of their Ihvorito object, it might create such 
divisions in ilu- army, as would weaken rather than 
strengthen the iiands of those, who were disposed to 
support Continental measures, and might tend to defeat the end tiiey themselves had in view, by endeavouring to interest the army. 

For these reasons I said, or meant to say, the army 
was a dangerous engine to work with, as it might be 
made to cut both ways ; antl, considering the sud'erings 
of it, would more than probably throw its weight into 
that scale, which seemed most likely to preponderate 
towards its immediate relief, without looking, under the 
pressure of necessity, to future consequences with the 
eyes of politicians, in tliis light, also, I meant to apply 
my observation to Mr. Morris, to whom, or rather to 
Mr, Gouvcrneur Morris, is ascribed in a great degree 
the groundwork of the superstructure, which was intended to be raised in the army by the anonymous 
addresser.

That no man can be more opposed to State funds or 
local prejudices than myself, the whole tenor of my 
conduct has been one continual evidence of. No man, 
perhaps, has had better opportunities to see and feel 
the pernicious tendency of the latter than I have ; and 
I endeavour (I hope not altogether incnectuall\) to 
inculcate this upon the officers of the army, upon all 
proper occasions ; but their feelings are to be attended 
to and soothed, and they must be assured, that, if 
Continental funds cannot be established, they will be 
recommended to their respective States for payment. 
Justice must be done them. 

I should do injustice to report what I believe to be the opinion of the army, were I not to inform you, that 
they consider you as a friend, zealous to serve them, 
and one who has espoused their interests in Congress 
upon every proper occasion. It is to be wished, as I 
observed in my letter to Colonel Bland, that Congress 
would send a committee to the army with plenipotentiary powers. The matters requested of me in your letter, as chairman of a committee, and many other 
things, might then be brought to a close with more 
despatch and in a happier manner, than it is likely they 
will be by an intercourse of letters at the distance of 
a hundred and fifty miles, which takes our expresses a 
week at least to go and return. At this moment, being 
without any instructions from Congress, I am under 
great embarrassment with respect to the soldiers for 
the war, and shall be obliged more than probably, from 
the necessity of the case, to exercise my own judgment, without waiting for orders as to the discharge of 
them. If I should adopt measures, which events will 
approve, all will be well ; if otherwise, " Why, and by 
what authority, did you do so ? " 

How far a strong recommendation from Congress to 
observe all the articles of peace as well as the 

may imply a suspicion of good faith in the people of this country, I pretend not to judge ; but I am 
much mistaken if something of the kind will not be 
found wanting, as I already perceive a disposition to 
carp at and to elude such parts of the treaty, as 
affect different interests, although you do not find a 
man, who, when pushed, will not agree, that, upon the 
whole, it is a more advantageous peace than we could 
possibly have expected. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

TO THK I'RESIDKNT OF CONGRESS. 

Ilcad-Quartors, 18 April, 178a 

Sir, 

I fiiul ii a duly incumbent on me  to communicate to 
your Excellrncy the pre.-^ciit di.sj)o.silion and tamper of 
part of the army. The accounts of peace, which have 
been received at diirerent times, have raised an expectation in the mind,-; of the men engaged for the war, 
that a speetly chscliarge must be the consequence. 
This idea has been so deeply impressed, that it has 
become difficult to hold them under that sense of 
discipline, which is necessary to bind together the 
subjects of an army. The dilatory manner, in which 
the intelligence of peace has arrived to us, has served 
to heighten this idea, and has led those men to some 
suspicion, that official despatches have not been forwarded, or ollicial declarations of peace have been 
postponed through design, that they might be held 
beyond the term of their engagements ; by which 
means they have in some instances scarcely been restrained from acts of excess. To such a description 
of men as the army is formed of, this idea is perhaps 
not an unnatural one. 

In this situation the proclamation of Congress for a 
cessation of hostilities found us on its aiTival yesterday. 
This act, being unaccompanied with any instructions for 
my conduct respecting the discharge of this part of the 
army if it should be found necessary, or any intimations of Congress upon that head, has thrown me into 
a most disagreeable situation. Knowing the temper 
of the men for the war, to suppress the publication 
would increase their suspicions ; and knowing their 
expectations, to publish it to men, who have not learnt 
to distinguish between a proclumatiou for a cessation of hostilities and a definitive declaration of peace, when 
they have authentic information that peace has already 
taken place, would serve to strengthen their ideas of 
immediate discharge, and stamp any claim to their further services with an appearance of injustice. In this 
dilemma, and being totally ignorant of the designs of 
the enemy in New York, who, from all I can collect, are 
making no show of an early evacuation of that city, 
I found it difficult to decide on the line of my duty. 
I therefore called a full council of the general officers 
of the army on the occasion. It was their unanimous judgment, that it would be equally impracticable 
and impolitic to attempt to suppress the proclamation, 
and that it should be issued in this day's orders. At 
the same time, the general officers are deeply impressed 
with an idea of the litde remaining hold, which, after 
this publication, we may expect to have upon the men 
for the loar, and of the absolute necessity there is, that 
Congress should come to some speedy determination 
upon this interesting point, as to what is to be the period of these men's service, and that they should give 
the earliest communication to me of their decision for 
my instruction towards effecting this important object. 
It has been seriously motioned to me, that I should 
hint to Congress the propriety and expediency of their 
appointing a committee of their own body, with plenazy 
powers, who may immediately repair to camp, and Avho 
may decide on the necessary arrangements for this important period. For my own part, I am fully in sentiment with this opinion, as such a measure would not 
only tend to quiet our present uneasiness, and help us 
over the difficulty of the moment, but would expedite 
the execution of many other arrangements, which will 
be found necessary, preparatory to our disbanding the 
present army. It might also serve to facilitate any negotiations, which it may be found expedient to enter 
into with Sir Guy Curlcton, for his speedy evacuation 
of New Yoriv, an object which at present seems at loo 
great a distance for our circumstances. Many other 
matters will undoubtedly present themselves which we 
cannot foresee, and which will occasion fi-ecjuent references to Congress; and, as much time is lost in communications between the army and that sovereign body, 
a committee on the spot, who might give immediate 
decision, would be of great importance, and perhaps 
suppress many disagreeable consequences which might 
arise merely from delay. One circumstance has already 
occurred, as Congress will perceive by the enclosed 
petition from the troops of the Now .Jersey line ; another I have this day heard of in the Connecticut Hne, extending to a claim of half-pay or commutation for the 
non-commissioned officers of that line. How far their 
ideas, if not suppressed by some lucky expedient, may 
proceed, it is beyond my power to divine. 

Notwithstanding the length of this letter, I must beg 
the liberty to suggest to Congress an idea, which has 
been hinted to me, and which has afTectcd my mind 
very forciljly. That is, that, at the discharge of the men 
for the war. Congress should suder those men, noncommissioned officers and soldiers, to take with them 
as their own property, and as a gratuity, the arms and 
accoutrements they now hold. This act would raise 
pleasing sensations in the minds of those worthy and 
faithful men, who, from their early engaging in the 
war at moderate bounties, and from their patient continuance under innumerable distresses, have not only 
deserved nobly of their country, but have obtained an 
honorable distinction over those, who, with shorter 
times, have gained large pecuniary rewards. This, at 
a comparatively small expense, would be deemed an honorable testimonial from Congress of the regard they 
bear to those distinguished worthies, and the sense they 
have had of their suliering virtues and services, which 
have been so happily instrumental towards the establishment and the security of the rights, liberties, and independence of this rising empire. These constant companions of their toils, preserved with sacred attention, 
would be handed down from the present possessors to 
their children, as honorary badges of bravery and military merit ; and would probably be brought forth, on 
some future occasion, with pride and exultation, to be 
hnproved with the same military ardor and emulation 
m the hands of posterity, as they have been used by 
then- forefathers in the present establishment and foundation of oiu" national independence and glory. 

Congress will suffer me to repeat my most earnest 
wish, that they will be pleased, either by themselves at 
large, or by their committee, to pay the earliest attention to the matters now referred to their consideration ; 
for I can only add, that, unless the most speedy arrangements for the war men are adopted, I contemplate 
with anxiety the disagreeable consequences, which, I 
fear, will be the result of much longer delay. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO SIK GUY CAKLETOX. 

llead-Quartors, 21 April, 178a 

Sir, 

I have the satisfaction of enclosing to your Excellency a proclaiiialiuii, which I have received from the 
sovereign power of the United States, ordering a general cessation of hostilities, as well by sea as land, with 
directions that the same should he published to all their 
subjects under my commtmd. In compliance with these 
instructions, the same was made public in the American 
cam[) on the 19th, \\ith my orders that it should be 
made known at all the out-posts of the American army 
as soon as possible. 

In consequence of this declaration, and in conformity 
to the articles of the treaty, Congress have been pleased 
to pass their resolutions of the 15th instant, directing 
arrangements to be formed for the liberation of all 
prisoners, and other purposes, which your Excellency 
will collect from the enclosed copy, which I transmit 
for your observation. 

In a conference, which I had yesterday with the 
minister at war, agreeably to the terms of the above mentioned resolutions, it has been agreed between us, 
that the land prisoners should be liberated as soon as 
possible, and that orders should be immediately given 
for commencing their march towards New York. But 
as their situation, by being removed to the interior of 
the countiy, is far distant from New York, which will 
make their march disagreeable and long, we have 
agreed to submit it to your option, whether to have 
them marched the whole distance through the country, 
or to have them delivered at the nearest water, where 
it may be convenient for your ships to receive them. 
Should you choose the latter, the following arrangement 
has been determined. The prisoners, who are lodged 
at Fredericktown and Winchester, in the States of 
Virginia and Maryland, in number about fifteen hundred, including women and children, will begin their 
march on the route towards Baltimore, where they 
may arrive on the 10th of May; at which time, should 
your ships be ready to receive them there, they may 
be embarked, and proceed to New York. If ships are 
not directed to receive them at the time mentioned at 
Baltimore, they will proceed by land to the Delaware. 
The remainder of the prisoners, being in Pennsylvania, amounting to about four thousand five hundred, 
may all (except those at Reading, between three and 
four hundred,) be embarked at Philadelphia, and also 
those from Fredericktown and Winchester, should they 
not be received at Baltimore, provided your ships 
are there by the 5th of May at farthest. Should ships 
not be ordered by your Excellency to take them by 
water, they will be marched in convenient detachments, 
of about five hundred each, through the country to 
Elizabethtown, with all convenient expedition. In any 
case, those from Reading, being in the upper part of 
Pennsylvania, will march directly to Elizabethtown. 

It is also suliniittcd lo your option to .send or nut, 
as you sliall think proper, an additional number of officers to attend tlic march of the prisoners through the 
coimtry, and to prevent any iiregularities that (H.sorderiy persons may he disposctl to commit. 

In either alternative respecting the receipt of the 
prisoners, you will be pleased to give the earliest informalion, to the minister at war in Philadelphia, of your 
determinations, that he may be able to make the necessary and timely dispositions to pay all proper attention 
to your choice. To expedite this purpose, and for the 
convenience of transportation, I enclose a passport for 
such odicers as you shall think proper to charge with 
your despatches on this occasion. 

Respecting the other subjects contained in the i nclosed resolution of Congress, as they may be discussed 
with more precision and despatch by a personal interview between your E.xcellency and myself, at some 
convenient time and intermediate place, such as may 
be agreed upon between your Excellency and Colonel Humphreys, my aid-de-camp, who will have the honor to deliver this letter, I would only suggest, that, in 
point of time, the earliest day you can name will be 
most agreeable to me. Should an interview be consented to on your part, the governor of this State, 
being particularly interested in any arrangements, which 
respect the restitution of the post of New York, will 
attend me on this occasion. I am, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 3 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I take the liberty to mention to your Excellency, 
that, in attending to the resolutions of Congress of the 
1.5th of April, respecting the posts in the United States 
occupied by the British troops, I find it necessary to 
apply for some more particular explanation of the intentions of Congress than is there expressed.

Taking it for granted, that the northern and western 
posts are included within the ideas of Congress, as 
well as New York, arrangements for receiving possession of those posts are to be made with General Haldimand, who commands in the district of Canada. As 
our communication will be distant and take much time, 
previous to commencing this coirespondence it will be 
necessary that I should be as fully instructed as circumstances will admit, as to the intentions of Congress 
respecting these frontier posts ; particularly what footing they will determine to place them upon in their 
peace estabhshment, and what number of men shall be 
sent to maintain them. Congress will also be impressed with the necessity of adopting the earliest measures 
possible for procuiinj^ the nu-ii, u lio will be necessary 
lor garrisoning the forts. Wliether this shall be effected by detaching the three years' men of the present army, or raising them in some other manner, will 
be also to be detennined. 

The posts should certainly be occupied by United 
States troops the moment they are evacuated by the 
British. Should this be neglected, I have my fears, 
that they may be burned or destroyed by the Indians, 
or some other evil-mindeil persons, whose disallt'ction 
to the government of the United States may lead them 
to such enormities. 

Arrangements for transporting the necessary artillery, 
stores, amnumitioii, and provisions, will take time, and 
will need immediate attention. The season for doing 
this is now at hand ; and if suffered to pass off, it will 
be exceedingly difficult if not impracticable to effect 
their transportation, particularly through the small water communications, which at the present season will 
be found very convenient, but which the summer heats 
will render so low, as to become almost impassable. 

Persuaded that Congress will view these subjects 
in the same important light that I do, I promise myself that I shall I)c favored with their instructions at 
the earliest moment possible. I am, &,c.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Orangetown, 6 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

In my letter of the 21st of April, I enclosed to your 
Excellency a copy of a resolution of Congress of the 
15th, instnicUng me in three points, which appeared 
necessary for carrying into effect the terms of the treaty between Great Britain and the United States 
of America ; and I informed you, that such part as 
rested upon my decision, and which regarded the release of prisoners, had been determined, and was then 
ordered to be carried into execution. Upon the other 
two points, as they respected the receiving possession 
of the posts in occupation of the British troops, and 
the carrying away any negroes or other property of the 
American inhabitants, and both being within your control, I had the honor to propose a personal interview 
with your Excellency, that the subject might be freely 
discussed, and that measures might be agreed upon, 
for carrying into execution those points of the seventh 
article of the treaty, agreeably to their true intent and 
spirit. 

Having been favored this day with a personal conference, I have now, to prevent misapprehension or 
misconstruction, and that I may be enabled to fulfil my 
instructions with fidelity and with candor, the honor to 
propose, agreeably to our conversation, that your Excellency will be pleased to give me in writing information as to what measures are adopting, on your part, 
for carrying into execution that point of the treaty, 
which regards the evacuation of the posts now in possession of the British troops and under your Excellency's command ; and also at what time it is probable those posts, or any of them, may be relinquished, 
and the fleets and armies of his Britannic Majesty 
withdrawn. 

Respecting the other point of discussion, in addition to what I mentioned in my communication of the 21st 
ultimo, I took occasion in our conference to inform your Excellency, that, in consequence of your letter 
of the 14th of April to Robert R. Livingston, Esquire, Congress had been pleased to make a further reference to me of that li'tttT, and had directed me to take sucii 
measures as shoultl be found necessary for carrying 
into ell'ect the several matters mentioned by you therein. Ill the course of our conversation on this point, 
I was surprised to hear you mention, that an embarliation had already taken place, in which a large number 
of negroes had been canietl away. Whether this conduct is consonant to, or how far it may be deemed an 
mfraction of the treaty, is not for me to decide. I 
cannot, however, conceal from you, that my private 
opinion is, that the measure is totally dilFerent from the 
letter and spirit of the treaty. But, waving the discussion of the point, and leaving its decision to our respective sovereigns, I find it my duty to signify my 
readiness, in conjunction with your Excellency, to enter into any agreement, or to take any measures, which 
may be deemed expedient, to prevent the future carrying away of any negroes, or other property of the American inhabitants. I beg the favor of your Excellency's reply, and have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE DUKE DE LAUZUN. 

Head-Quarters, 10 May, 1783. 

Sir, 

I had not the honor of receiving your favor of the 
1st instant until the 7th. Being at that time at Orangetown on a conference with Sir Guy Carleton, it had a 
circuitous route to make before it reached me. This 
circumstance you will be so good as to admit as an 
apology for my not giving an earlier reply. 

I have now the honor to mention to you, as I did 
some time ago to the minister of France, that, viewing 
the peace so near a final conclusion, I could not hold 
myself justified in a desire to detain the troops under 
your command from the expectations of their sovereign, or to prevent their own wishes of a return to 
their native country and friends. 

Nor can I omit, on this occasion, to express to you, 
Sir, and to all the brave officers and soldiers of your 
corps, the high esteem I have for them, and the regard I shall ever entertain for their services in the 
cause of the United States, to whose independence 
and establishment as a nation they have contributed a 
noble share. 

Your particular services. Sir, with the politeness, 
zeal, and attention, which I have ever experienced 
from you, have made a deep and lasting impression on 
my mind, and will serve to endear you to my remembrance. It would have been a great satisfaction to me to have hail further o[)portuiiity lo give you, in person, the assurances of my regard, could your orders 
have admitted your longer continuance in the country. 
But my regret at parting with you will be somewhat 
softened by the flattering hope you are pleased lo 
give me, that I may have the satisfaction of emi)racing 
you again in America ; where you may be assured I 
shall ever most sincerely rejoice in an opportunity of 
having it in my power to convince you of the very 
particular esteem and attaclunent, with which I have 
the honor to be, &,c.

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 20tli ol .May I received with much 
pleasure ; for I can assure you, that, among the many 
worthy and meritorious officers, with \\ horn I have had 
the happiness to be connected in service through the 
course of this war, and from whose cheerful assistance 
and advice I have received much support and confidence, in the various and trying vicissitudes of a complicated contest, the name of Putnam is not forgotten ; 
nor will it be but with that stroke of time, which shall 
obliterate from my mind the remembrance of all those 
toils and fatigues, through which we have struggled for 
the preservation and establishment of the rights, Uberties, and independence of our country. 

Your congratulations on the happy prospects of our 
peace and independent security, with their attendant 
blessings to the United States, I receive with great satisfaction ; and beg that you w'ill accept a return of my 
gratulations to you on this auspicious event ; an event, 
in which, great as it is in itself, and glorious as it will 
probably be in its consequences, you have a right to 
participate largely, from the disUnguished part you have 
contributed towards its attainment. 

But while I contemplate the greatness of the object 
for w^hich we have contended, and felicitate you on the 
happy issue of our toils and labors, which have terminated with such general satisfaction, I lament that you 
should feel the ungrateful returns of a country, in whose 
service you have exhausted your bodily health, and expended the vigor of a youthful constitution. I wish, 
however, that your expectations of returning sentiments 
of liberality may be verified. I have a hope, that they 
may ; but, should they not, your case will not be a singular one. Ingratitude has been experienced in all 
ages, and republics in particular have ever been famed 
for the exercise of that unnatural and sordid vice. 

The secretary at war, who is now here, informs me 
that you have been considered as entitled to full pay 
since your absence from the field ; and that you will be 
still considered in that Hght till the close of the war, 
at which period you will be equally entitled to the same 
emoluments of half-pay or commutation as other officers of your rank. The same opinion is also given by 
the paymaster-general, who is now with the army, empowered by Mr. Morris for the settlement of all their 
accounts, and who will attend to yours whenever you 
shall think proper to send on for the purpose ; which 
it wdll probably be best for you to do in a short time. 

I anticipate with ploasiirc the day, and that I trust 
not far otV, when I sliall (jiiit the busy scenes of a military employment, anil retire to the more tranquil walks 
of domestic life, la 'hai, or in whatever other situation 
Providence may dispose my future days, the rememhrance of the many frienilsliips and connexions I have 
had the happiness to contract with the gentlemen of 
the armv will be one of my most grateful reflections. 
Under this contemplation, and impressed with the sentiments of benevolence and regard, I commend you, 
my dear Sir, my other friends, and with them the interests and happiness of our dear country, to the 
keeping and protection of Almighty God. 

I have the honor to be, &.c.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Head-Quarters, G June, 1783. 

Sir, 

Before I make a reply to the subject of the address 
of the generals and officers, commanding the regiments 
and corps of this army, presented by yourself yesterday, I entreat that those gentlemen will accept my 
warmest acknowledgment for the confidence they have 
been pleased to repose in me. They may be assured 
it shall never be abused ; and I beg they will be persuaded, that, as no man can possibly be better acquainted than I am wiih the past merits and services 
of the army, so no one can possibly be more strongly 
impressed with their present ineligible situation, feel a 
keener sensibility at their distresses, or more ardently 
desire to alleviate or remove them. But it would be unnecessary, perhaps, to enter into a detail of what I 
have done, and what I am still attempting to do, in order to assist in the accomplishment of this interesting 
purpose. Let it be suflicient to observe, that I do not 
yet despair of success ; for I am perfectly convinced 
that the States cannot, without involving themselves in 
national bankruptcy and ruin, refuse to comply with the 
requisitions of Congress; who, it must be acknowledged, have done every thing in their power to obtain 
ample and complete justice for the army ; and whose 
great object in the present measure undoubtedly was, 
by a reduction of expense, to enable the financier to 
make the three months' payment to the army, which 
on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely and indispensably necessary. To explain this matter, I beg 
leave to insert an extract of a letter from the supermtendent of finance, dated the 29th ultimo. 

It is now a month since the committee conferred 
with me on that subject, and I then told them no payment could be made to the army, but by means of a 
paper anticipation ; and, unless our expenditures were 
immediately and considerably reduced, even that could 
not be done. Our expenditures have nevertheless been 
continued, and our revenues lessen, the States growing 
daily more and more remiss in their collections. The 
consequence is, that I cannot make payment in the 
manner first intended. The notes issued for this pm'pose would have been payable at two, four, and six 
months from the date, but at present they will be at 
six months, and even that will soon become impracticable, unless our expenses be immediately curtailed. 

I shall cause such notes to be issued for three 
months' pay to the army ; and I must entreat. Sir, that 
every influence be used with the States to absorb them, 
together with my other engagements, by taxation."

riuuc days ago, a inossfiigcr was despatched by me 
ti) urge the necessity ot" lorwai-iling these notes with 
the greatest possible expedition. Under this stale of 
circumstances, I need scarcely acUi, that tl\e ex[)ense 
of every day, in feeding the whole army, will increase 
very consitkrably the inability of the public to discharge 
the debts already incurred, at least for a considerable 
time to come. Although (Ik,' officers of the army very 
well know my ollicial situation, that I am only a servant 
of the public, and that it is not for me to dispense 
with onlcrs, which it is my duty to carry into execution ; yet, as furloughs in all services are considered as 
a matter of indulgence, and not of compulsion ; as 
Congress, I am persuaded, entertain the best disposition towards the army ; and as I apprehend in a very 
short time the two principal articles of complaint will be 
removed ; I shall not hesitate to comply with the wishes 
of the army, under these reservations only, that officers 
suflicient to conduct the men, who choose to receive 
furloughs, will attend them, either on furlough or by 
detachment. The propriety and necessity of this measure must be obvious to all ; it need not, therefore, be 
enforced ; and, with regard to the non-commissioned 
officers and privates, such, as from a peculiarity of circumstances wish not to receive furloughs at this time, 
will give in their names by twelve o'clock to-morrow 
to the commanding officers of their regiments, that, on 
a report to the adjutant-general, an equal number of 
men, engaged for three years, may be furloughed, which 
will make the saving of expenses exactly the same to 
the pubhc. 

I cannot but hope the notes will soon arrive, and 
that the settlement of accounts may be completed, by 
the assistance of the paymasters, in a very few days. 
In the mean time, I shall have the honor of laying the sentiments of the generals and officers, commanding 
regiments and corps, before Congress ; they are expressed in such a decent, candid, and affecting manner, that I am certain every mark of attention will be 
paid to them. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THK PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 7 June, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose to your Excellency the 
copy of an address to me, from the generals and officers commanding regiments and corps, together with 
my answer to it. These enclosures will explain the 
distresses, which resulted from the measures now carrying into execution, in consequence of the resolution 
of the 26th of May ; but the sensibility occasioned by 
a parting scene under such peculiar cii-cumstances will 
not admit of description. 

The two subjects of complaint with the army appear to be, the delay of the three months' payment, 
which had been expected, and the want of a setdement of accounts. I have thought myself authorized 
to assure them, that Congress had attended and would 
attend particularly to their grievances, and have made 
some little variations respecting furloughs from what 
was at first proposed. The secretary at war will be 
able to explain the reason and propriety of this alteration. 

While I consider it a tribute of justice on this occasion, to mention the temperate and orderly behaviour 
of the whole army, and particularly the accommodating 
spirit of the officers in arranging themselves to the 
command of the battaUons, which will be composed 
of the three years' men, permit me to recall to mind 
all their former suflTerings and merits, and to recommend their reasonable request to the early and favorable notice of Congress. I am, Sec

CIRCULAR LETTER ADDRESSKU TO THE GOVERNORS OF ALL THE STATES O.V IMSUANDI.NU THE AK.MY. 

Head-Quarters, Ncwburg, 8 June, 17e3. 

Sir, 

The great object, for which I had the honor to hold 
an appointment in the service of my country, being 
accomplishcii, I am now preparing to resign it into the 
hiuuls of Congress, and to return to that domestic retirement, which, it is well known, I left with the greatest reluctance; a retirement for which I have never 
ceased to sigh, through a long and painful absence, and 
in which (remote from the noise and trouble of the 
world) I meditate to pass the remainder of life, in a 
state of undisturbed repose. But before I carry this 
resolution into eHVct, I think it a duty incumbent on 
me to make this my last ollicial communication ; to 
congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven 
has been pleased to produce in our favor ; to oder my 
sentiments respecting some important sul)jects, which 
appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquillity of the United States ; to take my leave of your 
Excellency as a public character ; anil to give my final 
blessing to that country, in whose service I have spent 
the prime of my life, for whose sake I have consumed SO many anxious days and watchful nights, and whose 
happiness, being extremely dear to me, will always 
constitute no inconsiderable part of my own. 

Impressed with the liveliest sensibility on this pleasing occasion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the 
more copiously on the subjects of our mutual fehcitation. When we consider the magnitude of the prize 
we contended for, the doubtful nature of the contest, 
and the favorable manner in which it has terminated, 
we shall find the greatest possible reason for gratitude 
and rejoicing. This is a theme that will afford infinite 
delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether 
the event in contemplation be considered as the source 
of present enjoyment or the parent of future happiness ; and we shall have equal occasion to felicitate 
ourselves on the lot which Providence has assigned us, 
whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral 
point of light. 

The citizens of America, placed in the most enviable 
condition, as the sole lords and proprietors of a vast 
tract of continent, comprehending all the various soils 
and climates of the world, and abounding with all the 
necessaries and conveniences of life, are now, by the 
late satisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be possessed of absolute freedom and independency. They 
are, from this period, to be considered as the actors 
on a most conspicuous theatre, which seems to be peculiarly designated by Providence for the display of human greatness and felicity. Here they are not only 
surrounded with every thing, which can contribute to 
the completion of private and domestic enjoyment ; but 
Heaven has crowned all its other blessings, by giving 
a fairer opportunity for political happiness, than any 
other nation has ever been favored with. Nothing can 
illustrate these observations more forcibly, than a recollcction oF the happy conjuncture of times and circumstances, under which our republic assumed its rank 
among the nations. The foundation of our empire was 
not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and superstition ; but at im epocha wlicn Uie rigiits of mankind were 
better understood and more cleaily defmed, than at 
any former period. The researches of the human mind 
after social happiness have been carried to a great 
extent ; the treasures of knowledge, acquired by the 
labors of philosophers, sages, and legislators, through 
a long succession of years, are laid open for our use, 
and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in 
the establishment of our forms of government. The 
free cultivation of letters, the unbounded extension of 
commerce, the progressive refinement of manners, the 
growing liberality of sentiment, and, above all, the pure 
and benign light of Revelation, have had a meliorating 
inlluence on mankind and increased the blessings of 
society. At this auspicious period, the United States 
came into existence as a nation ; and, if their citizens 
should not be completely free and happy, the fault will 
be entirely their own. 

Such is our situation, and such are our prospects ; 
but, notwithstanding the cup of blessing is thus reached 
out to us ; notwithstanding happiness is ours, if we 
have a disposition to seize the occasion and make it our 
own ; yet it appears to me there is an option still left 
to the United States of America, that it is in their 
choice, and depends upon their conduct, whether they 
will be respectable and prosperous, or contemptible and 
miserable, as a nation. This is the time of their political 
probation ; this is the moment when the eyes of the 
whole world are turned upon them ; this is the moment 
to establish or ruin their national character for ever; 
this is the favorable moment to give such a tone to our federal government, as will enable it to answer the ends 
of its institution, or this may be the ill-fated moment for 
relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the confederation, and exposing us to become 
the sport of European politics, which may play one 
State against another, to prevent their growing importance, and to serve their own interested purposes. 
For, according to the system of policy the States shall 
adopt at this moment, they will stand or fall ; and by 
their confirmation or lapse it is yet to be decided, 
whether the revolution must ultimately be considered 
as a blessing or a curse ; a blessing or a curse, not to 
the present age alone, for with om fate will the destiny 
of unborn millions be involved. 

With this conviction of the importance of the present 
crisis, silence in me would be a crime. I will therefore 
speak to your Excellency the language of freedom and 
of sincerity without disguise. I am aware, however, 
that those who differ from me in political sentiment, may 
perhaps remark, that I am stepping out of the proper line 
of my duty, and may possibly ascribe to arrogance or 
ostentation, what I know is alone the result of the purest 
intention. But the rectitude of my own heart, which 
disdains such unworthy motives ; the part I have hitherto acted in life ; the determination I have formed, of not 
taking any share in public business hereafter ; the ardent desire I feel, and shall continue to manifest, of 
quietly enjoying, in private life, after all the toils of 
Avar, the benefits of a wise and Hberal government, 
will, I flatter myself, sooner or later convince my 
countrymen, that I could have no sinister views in 
delivering, with so little reserve, the opinions contained in this address. 

There are four things, which, I humbly conceive, are 
essential to the well-being, I may even ventui-e to say, to the existence of the United States, as an independent power. 

First. An indissoluble union of the States under one 
federal head. 

Second. A sacred regard to public justice. 

Third. The adoption of a proper peace establishment ; and, 

Fourth. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly 
disposition among the people of the United States, 
which will induce them to forget their local prejudices 
and policies ; to make those mutual concessions, which are requisite to the general prosperity ; and, in some 
instances, to sacrifice their individual advantages to the interest of the community. 

These are the pillars on which the glorious fabric 
of our independency and national character must be 
supported. Liberty is the basis ; and whoever would 
dare to sap the foundadon, or overturn the structure, 
under whatever specious pretext he may attempt it, 
will merit the bitterest execration, and the severest 
punishment, which can be inllicted by his injured 
country. 

On the three first articles I will make a few observations, leaving the last to the good sense and serious consideration of those immediately concerned. 

Under the first head, although it may not be necessary or proper for me, in this place, to enter into a particular disquisition on the principles of the Union, and 
to take up the great question which has been frequently 
agitated, whether it be expedient and requisite for the 
States to delegate a larger proportion of power to Congress, or not ; yet it will be a part of my duty, and 
that of every true patriot, to assert without reserve, 
and to insist upon, the following positions. That, unless the States will suffer Congress to exercise those prerogatives they are undoubtedly invested with by the 
constitution, every thing must very rapidly tend to anarchy and confusion. That it is indispensable to the 
happiness of the individual States, that there should be 
lodged somewhere a supreme power to regulate and 
govern the general concerns of the confederated republic, without which the Union cannot be of long duration. 
That there must be a faithful and pointed compliance, 
on the part of every State, with the late proposals and 
demands of Congress, or the most fatal consequences 
will ensue. That whatever measures have a tendency 
to dissolve the Union, or contribute to violate or lessen 
the sovereign authority, ought to be considered as hostile to the liberty and independency of America, and the 
authors of them treated accordingly. And lastly, that 
unless we can be enabled, by the concurrence of the 
States, to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and 
enjoy the essential benefits of civil society, under a form 
of government so free and uncorrupted, so happily 
guarded against the danger of oppression, as has been 
devised and adopted by the articles of confederation, it 
will be a subject of regret, that so much blood and 
treasure have been lavished for no purpose, that so 
many sufferings have been encountered without a compensation, and that so many sacrifices have been made 
in vain. 

Many other considerations might here be adduced 
to prove, that, without an entire conformity to the spirit 
of the Union, we cannot exist as an independent power. 
It will be sufficient for my purpose to mention but one 
or two, which seem to me of the greatest importance. 
It is only in our united character, as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our power can be 
regarded, or our credit supported, among foreign nations. The treaties of the European powers with the 
United States of Amcricii will have no validity on a 
dissolution of the Union. We sliall he left nearly in a 
state ot' nature ; or we may find, hy our own unhappy 
experience, that there is a natural and necessary progression from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme 
of tyranny, antl that arhitrary power is most easily 
established on the ruins of liberty, abused to licentiousness. 

As to the second article, which respects the performance of public justice. Congress liave, in their late 
address to the United States, almost exhausted the 
subject ; they have explained their ideas so fully, and 
have enforced the obligations the States are under, to 
render complete justice to all the public creditors, with 
so much dignity and energy, that, in my opinion, no real 
friend of the honor and independency of America can 
hesitate a single moment, respecting the propriety of 
complybg with the just and honorable measures proposed. If their arguments do not produce conviction, 
I know of nothing that will have greater influence ; 
especially when we recollect, that the system referred 
to, being the result of the collected wisdom of the continent, must be esteemed, if not perfect, certainly the 
least objectionable of any that could be devised ; and 
that, if it shall not be carried into immediate execution, 
a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable consequences, will take place, before any difierent plan can possibly be proposed and adopted. So pressing are the 
present circumstances, and such is the alternative now 
oflTered to the States. 

The ability of the country to discharge the debts, 
which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be 
doubted ; an inclination, I flatter myself, w ill not be 
wanting. The path of our duty is plain before us ; honesty will be found, on every experiment, to be the best and only true policy. Let us then, as a nation, be just ; 
let us fulfil the public contracts, which Congress had 
undoubtedly a right to make for the purpose of carrying 
on the war, with the same good faith we suppose ourselves bound to perform our private engagements. In 
the mean time, let an attention to the cheerful performance of their proper business, as individuals and as 
members of society, be earnestly inculcated on the 
citizens of America ; then will they strengthen the 
hands of government, and be happy under its protection ; every one will reap the fruit of his labors, 
every one will enjoy his own acquisitions, without 
molestation and without danger. 

In this state of absolute freedom and perfect security, who will grudge to yield a very little of his 
property to support the common interest of society, 
and insure the protection of government? Who does 
not remember the frequent declarations, at the commencement of the war, that Ave should be completely 
satisfied, if, at the expense of one half, we could defend the remainder of our possessions ? Where is 
the man to be found, who wishes to remain indebted 
for the defence of his own person and property to 
the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, 
without making one generous effort to repay the debt 
of honor and of gratitude I In what part of the continent shall we find any man, or body of men, who 
would not blush to stand up and propose measures, 
purposely calculated to rob the soldier of his stipend, 
and the public creditor of his due ? And were it 
possible, that such a flagrant instance of injustice 
could ever happen, would it not excite the general 
indignation, and tend to bring down upon the authors 
of such measures the aggravated vengeance of Heaven ? 
If, after all, a spirit of disunion, or a temper of obstinacy 
and pen-crscness should manitl'st itself in any of the 
States ; if such an un;i;racious disposition should attempt 
to frustrate all the happy eflects that might be expected 
to How from the Union ; if there should be a refusal to 
comply with the requisitions for funds to discharge the 
annual interest of the \ni\)\\c debts; and if that refusal 
should revive again all those jealousies, and produce 
all tliose evils, which ai-e now happily removed, Congress, who have, in all their transactions, shown a great 
degree of magnanimity and justice, will stand justified 
in the sight of God and man ; and that State alone, 
which puts itself in opposition to the aggregate wisdom 
of the continent, and follows such mistaken and pernicious counsels, will be responsible for all the consequences. 

For my own part, conscious of having acted, while 
a servant of the public, in the manner I conceived best 
suited to promote the real interests of my country ; 
having, in consequence of my lixed belief, in some 
measure pledged myself to the army, that their country would finally do them complete and ample justice ; 
and not wishing to conceal any instance of my oflicial 
conduct from the eyes of the vvoild, I have thought 
proper to transmit to your Excellency the enclosed collection of papers, relative to the half-pay and commutation granted by Congress to the olFicers of the ai-my. 
From these communications, my decided sentiments 
will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclusive reasons which induced me, at an early period, 
to recommend the adoption of the measure, in the 
most earnest and serious manner. As the proceedings of Congress, the army, and myself, are open to all, 
and contain, in mv opinion, sufTicient information to remove the prejudices and errors, which may have been 
entertained by any, I think it unnecessary to say any 
thing more than just to observe, that the resolutions 
of Congress, now alluded to, are undoubtedly as absolutely binding upon the United States, as the most 
solemn acts of confederation or legislation. 

As to the idea, -which, I am informed, has in some 
instances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation 
are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a pension, it ought to be exploded for ever. That provision 
should be viewed, as it really was, a reasonable compensation offered by Congress, at a time A\hen they 
had nothing else to give to the officers of the army for 
services then to be performed. It was the only means 
to prevent a total dereliction of the service. It was a 
part of their hire. I may be allowed to say, it was the 
price of their blood, and of your independency ; it is 
therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of 
honor ; it can never be considered as a pension or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly discharged. 

With regard to a distinction between officers and 
soldiers, it is sufficient that the uniform experience of 
every nation of the world, combined with our own, 
proves the utihty and propriety of the discrimination. 
Rewards, in proportion to the aids which the public 
derives from them, are unquestionably due to all its 
servants. In some lines, the soldiers have perhaps 
generally had as ample compensation for their services, 
by the large bounties which have been paid to them, as 
their officers will receive in the proposed commutation ; 
in others, if, besides the donation of lands, the payment 
of arrearages of clothing and wages (in which articles 
all the component parts of the army must be put upon 
the same footing), we take into the estimate the bounties 
many of the soldiers have received, and the gratuity 
of one year's full pay, which is promised to aU, possibly 
their situation (every circumstance being duly considered) will not be deemed less eligible than that of the 
oflict-rs. ShoiiKl a iiiither reward, however, be judged 
equitable, I will venture to assert, no one will enjoy 
greater satisfaction than myself, on seeing an exemption from taxes for a limited time, (which has been 
petitioned for in some instances,) or any other adequate immunity or compensation granted to the brave 
defentlers of their country's cause ; but neither the 
adoption nor rejection of this proposition will in any 
manner allect, much less militate against, the act of 
Congress, by which they have offered five years' full 
pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been 
before promised to the otlicers of the army. 

Before I conclude the subject of public justice, I 
cannot omit to mention the obligations this country 
is under to that meritorious class of veteran noncommissioned officers and privates, who have been 
discharged for inability, in consequence of the resolution of Congress of the 23d of April, 178-2, on an 
annual pension for life. Their peculiar sufferings, their 
singular merits, and claims to that provision, need only 
be known, to interest all the feelings of humanity in 
their behalf. Nothing but a punctual payment of their 
annual allowance can rescue them from the most complicated misery ; and nothing could be a more melancholy and distressing sight, than to behold those, who 
have shed their blood or lost their limbs in the service 
of their country, without a shelter, without a friend, 
and without the means of obtaining any of the necessaries or comforts of life, compelled to beg their daily 
bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend 
those of thistlescription, belonging to your State, to the 
warmest patronage of your Excellency and your legislature. 

It is necessary to say but a few words on the third topic which was proposed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic ; as there can be little 
doubt that Congress will recommend a proper peace 
establishment for the United States, in which a due 
attention will be paid to the importance of placing the 
militia of the Union upon a regular and respectable 
footing. If this should be the case, I would beg leave 
to urge the great advantage of it in the strongest terms. 
The militia of this country must be considered as the 
palladium of our security, and the first efiectual resort 
in case of hostility. It is essential, therefore, that the 
same system should pervade the whole ; that the formation and discipline of the militia of the continent 
should be absolutely uniform, and that the same species of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, 
should be introduced in every part of the United 
States. No one, who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expense, and 
confusion, which result from a contrary system, or 
the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed. 
If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude 
than usual has been taken in the course of this address, the importance of the crisis, and the magnitude 
of the objects in discussion, must be my apology. It 
is, however, neither my wish nor expectation, that the 
preceding observations should claim any regard, except so far as they shall appear to be dictated by a 
good intention, consonant to the immutable rules of 
justice, calculated to produce a liberal system of policy, and founded on whatever experience may have 
been acquired by a long and close attention to public 
business. Here I might speak with the more confidence, from my actual observations ; and, if it would 
not swell this letter (already too prolix) beyond the 
bounds I had prescribed to myself, I could demonstrate, to every iiiiml open to conviction, lh;il in Irss time, and 
willi much less expense, than lias been incurred, the 
war might have been brought to the same happy conchision, if the resources of the continent could have 
been properly drawn lorlh ; that the distresses and 
disappointments, which have very often occurred, have, 
in too many instances, resulted more Irom a want of 
enernv in the Continental government, than a deficiency 
ot" means in the particular States ; that the inellicacy 
of measures arising from the want of an adequate authority in the supreme power, from a partial compliance 
with the requisitions of Congress in some of the States, 
and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it 
tended to damp the zeal of those, who were more 
willing to exert themselves, served also to accumulate 
the expenses of the war, and to frustrate the best concerted plans ; and that the discouragement occasioned 
by the complicated didiculties and embarrassments, in 
which our adairs were by this means involved, would 
have long ago produced the dissolution of any army, 
less patient, less virtuous, and less persevering, than 
that which I have had the honor to command. But, 
while I mention these things, which are notorious facts, 
as the defects of our federal constitution, particularly 
in the prosecution of a war, I beg it may be understood, that, as I have ever taken a pleasure in gratefully 
acknowledging the assistance and support I have derived from every class of citizens, so shall I always be 
happy to do justice to the unparalleled exertions of the 
individual States on many interesting occasions. 

I have thus freely disclosed what I wished to make 
known, before I surrendered up my public trust to 
those who committed it to me. The task is now accomplished. I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magistrate of your State, at the same time 
I bid a last farewell to the cares of office, and all the employments of public life. 

It remains, then, to be my final and only request, that 
your Excellency will communicate these sentiments to 
your legislature at their next meeting, and that they 
may be considered as the legacy of one, who has 
ardently wished, on all occasions, to be useful to his 
country, and who, even in the shade of retirement, will 
not fail to implore the Divine benediction upon it. 

I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would 
have you, and the State over which you preside, in his 
holy protection ; that he would incline the hearts of 
the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and 
obedience to government ; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow citizens 
of the United States at large, and particularly for their 
brethren who have served in the field ; and finally, that 
he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all 
to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves 
with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, 
which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of 
our blessed reUgion, and without an humble imitation 
of whose example in these things, we can never hope 
to be a happy nation. 

I have the honor to be, with much esteem and respect, Sir, your Excellency's most obedient and most 
humble servant.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Newburg, 24 June, 1783. 

Sir, 

It was not until three o'clock this afternoon, that I 
had the first information of the infamous and outrageous 
mutiny of a part of the Pennsylvania troops. It was 
then I received your Excellency's letter of the 2 1st by 
your express, and, agreeably to your request contained 
in it, I instantly ordered three complete regiments of 
infantry and a detachment of artillery to be put in motion as soon as possible. This corps, which, you will 
observe by the return, is a large proportion of our whole force, will consist of upwards of fifteen hundred effectives. As all the troops, who composed this gallant 
little army, as well those who are rurl()Ui;hed, as those 
who remain in service, are men of trictl falclit}', I could 
not have occasion to make any choice of corps ; and I 
have only to regret, that there exists a necessity, that 
they should be employed on so disagreeable a service. 
I dare say, however, they will on this and all other 
occasions perform their duty, as brave and faithful soldiers. 

While I suffer the most poignant distress, in observing that a handful of men, contemptible in numbers, 
and equally so in point of service (if the veteran troops 
from the southward have not been seduced by their 
example), and who are not worthy to be called soldiers, 
should disgrace themselves and their country as the 
Pennsylvania mutineers have done, by insulting the 
sovereign authority of the United States and that of 
their own, I feel an inexpressible satisfaction, that even 
this behaviour cannot stain the name of the American 
soldiery. It cannot be imputable to, or reflect dishonor 
on, the army at large ; but on the contrary, it will, by 
the striking contrast it exhibits, hold up to public view 
the other troops in the most advantageous point of 
light. Upon taking all the circumstances into consideration, I cannot sufficiently express my surprise and 
indignation at the arrogance, the folly, and the wickedness of the mutineers ; nor can I sufficiently admire the 
fidelity, the bravery, and the patriotism, which must for 
ever signalize the unsullied character of the other 
corps of our army. For, when we consider, that these 
Pennsylvania levies, who have now mutinied, are recruits and soldiers of a day, who have not borne the 
heat and burden of the war, and who can have in 
reality very few hardships to complain of; and when we at the same time recollect, that those soldiers, \vho have 
lately been furloughed from this army, are the veterans 
who have patiently endured hunger, nakedness, and 
cold, who have suffered and bled without a murmur, 
and who, with perfect good order, have retired to their 
homes without a settlement of their accounts, or a 
farthing of money in their pockets ; we shall be as 
much astonished at the virtues of the latter, as we are 
struck with horror and detestation at the proceedings 
of the former; and every candid mind, without indulging ill-grounded prejudices, will undoubtedly make the 
proper discrimination. 

I intended only to wait until the troops were collected, and had occupied their new camp, in order to 
make a full report to Congress of the measures, which 
have been taken in consequence of the resolution of 
the 26th of May. notwithstanding the option, which 
was given in my answer to the address of the generals 
and officers commanding regiments and corps, which 
has been already sent to your Excellency, no soldiers, 
except a very few, whose homes are within the enemy's lines, and a very small number of officers, have 
thought proper to avail themselves of it, by remaining 
with the army. A list of those who remain is herewith transmitted. The men engaged to serve three 
years were then formed into regiments and corps in 
the following manner ; namely, the troops of Massachusetts compose four regiments ; Connecticut, one regiment ; New Hampshire, five companies ; Rhode Island, 
two companies ; Massachusetts artillery, three companies ; and New York artillery, two companies. The 
total strength will be seen by the weekly state, which 
is also forwarded. 

The army being thus reduced to merely a competent garrison for West Point, that being the only object of importance in this quarter, and it being necessary to 
employ a considerable part of the men in building an 
arsenal and magazines at that post, agreeably to the 
directions given by the secretary at war, the troops 
accordingly broke up the cantonment yesterday, and 
removed to that garrison, where Major-General Knox 
still retains the command. The detachment, which 
marches for Philadelphia, will be under the orders of 
Major-General Howe, Major-General Heath having, at 
his own particular request, retired from the field. The 
brigadiers now remaining with the army are Paterson, 
Huntington, and Greaton, besides the adjutant-general. 
Thus have I given the present state of our military 
affairs, and I hope the arrangements will be satisfactory to Congress. I have the honor to be, &lc. 

P. S. Should any thing turn up, which may prevent the necessity of the troops proceeding to Philadelphi;i, I am to request your Excellency will send 
the earliest intimation to the commanding officer, that 
the detachment may return immediately. The route 
will be by Ringwood, Pompton, Morristown, Princeton, 
and Trenton, on which your express may meet the 
corps.

TO MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Instructions. 

Sir, 

You are to take the command of the detachment, 
ordered to march to Philadelphia, in consequence of 
the letter of the President of Congress of the 21st 
instant. You will move with as much expedition as 
you can, consistently with the health and comfort of 
the troops. This corps will be absolutely light and 
unencumbered with baggage, having only two pieces 
of field-artillery. You will make arrangements with 
the quartermaster-general for the transportation, and 
with the contractors for a supply of provisions and 
rum. Your route will be by way of Ringwood, Pompton, Morristown, and Princeton to Trenton, where it 
would be most convenient, if you could make arrangements for embarking the troops, to proceed from thence 
by water to Philadelphia; but this must depend upon 
circumstances, and will require circumspection to prevent the mutineers from taking advantage and annoying your landing. 

The object of your command is to suppress a mutiny, which has taken place amongst a part of the 
Pennsylvania troops ; in the accomplishment of which 
you will be governed by your own discretion, until 
you can receive the orders of Congress, Should the 
tumult have subsided, you will meet directions from 
the President, countermanding your march. You will 
then return by easy movements. 

In all cases you will be pleased to pay particular 
attention to the order and discipline of the troops, and 
you will regulate youi- marches early in the morning 
(ir at evening, in such manner that the men may rest 
in the heat of the day ; and be as conveniently accommodated in every respect as the nature of the 
circumstances will admit. Given at Head-Quarters,

Head-Quarters, 30 June, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's favor of the '26ih, and to thank you for the 
information contained in it. 

If Congress should have already taken up, or should 
they be about to determine on the subject of receiving possession of the posts on the western frontier, 
which was mentioned in my letters of the 3d of May 
and 7th of June, I would take the liberty to recommend Major-General the Baron Steuben, who will have 
the honor of delivering this letter, as a gentleman very 
much acquainted with military dispositions, as well as 
with the language commonly spoken in Canada ; and 
on those accounts particularly calculated to make the 
arrangements, which may be necessary on this occasion. The Baron will not hesitate to undertake the 
negotiation with General Ilaldimand, if it should be 
agreeable to the sentiments of Congress ; and I need 
only add, that, from the zeal and intelligence he has 
always manifested in the public service, a judgment 
may be formed of the attention and fidelity, which 
may be expected of him in the performance of this 
or any other duty, which shall be committed to his 
charge. I have the honor to be, Si.c.

Head-Quarters, State of New York, 10 July, 1783. 

Sir, 

You profess not to be a panegyrist, while you are 
bestowing the most exalted praise ; but, compliments 
apart, I received your very polite letter of the 25th 
of March with much pleasure. It recalled to my remembrance some of the pleasing occurrences of my 
past life, and reminded me of the acquaintances I had 
formed in it ; for whom, though separated by time, 
distance, and political sentiments, I retain the same 
friendship. 

I was opposed to the policy of Great Britain, and 
became an enemy to her measures ; but I always distinguished between a cause and individuals ; and, while 
the latter supported their opinions upon liberal and 
generous grounds, personally I never could be an enemy to them. 

I have only to request, therefore, that you will suffer me to retain that place in your friendship, which 
you assure me I now hold ; and that you will accept 
my sincere thanks for the favorable sentiments you 
have been pleased to express of me, and will do me 
the justice to believe, that, with great esteem and regard, I have the honor to be, &c.

r.\-tiiiF.r or Tin: hkiiisii troops in (anada. 

Ilcad-Quartore, on Hudson's River, 12 July, 1783. 

Sin, 

The Congress of the United States having instructed 
me to make the proper arrangements with the Comnuuuler-in-chiet" of (he British forces in America, for 
receiving possession of the posts in the United States 
occupied l)y the troops of his Britannic Majesty, and 
from which his Majesty's troops are to be withdrawn, 
agreeably to the seventh article of the provisional treaty, 
I have to inform your Excellency, that I have desired 
Major-GenenU the Baron Steuben, who will have the 
honor to deliver this letter, to proceed for that purpose 
into Canada ; and I have fully empowered and authorized him to form every arrangement with your Excellency, which may be found necessary, for receiving 
possession of the posts and fortresses on the northwestern and western frontier of the territory of the 
United States, now under your direction ; and I beg 
you to be persuaded, that whatever agreements this 
officer shall form with your Excellency, respecting 
this business, will be punctually observed on the part 
of the United States. 

Baron Steuben is instructed to visit the posts within 
the boundary of the United States upon the River St. 
Lawrence and the Lakes above, and to report to me 
his opinion of the measures necessary for the garrisoning and support of them. In this tour, and in the 
execution of this business, I flatter myself he will receive the necessary passports from your Excellency, 
and derive such aids as will enable him to fulfil the 
objects of his commission. 

As a foreigner, and an officer of rank and reputation, I beg leave to recommend the Baron to your 
Excellency's particular notice and attention. As a gentleman, you will find him every way worthy of your 
civilities. I have the honor to be, &,c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO BARON STEUBEN. 

Instructions. 

In consequence of powers in me invested for that 
purpose, I do hereby authorize and desire you to proceed, with such despatch as you shall find convenient, 
into Canada, and there concert with General Haldimand, or other British commander-in-chief in that province, all such measures as you shall find necessary for 
receiving possession of the posts now under his command within the territory ceded to the United States, 
and at present occupied by the troops of his Britannic 
Majesty, and from which his said Majesty's troops are 
to be withdrawn, agreeably to the seventh article of 
the provisional treaty between his said Majesty and the 
United States of America. 

In accomplishing this negotiation, you will obtain, if 
possible, from General Haldimand his assurances and 
orders for the immediate possession, by the United 
States, of the posts in question, or at least a cession 
of them at an early day. But if this cannot be done, 
you will endeavour to procure from him positive and 
definitive assurances, that he will, as soon as possible, 
give information of the time that shall be fixed on for 
the evacuation of those posts, and that the troops of 
his Britannic Majesty shall not be drawn therefrom, 
until sufficient previous notice shall be given of that 
event, that the troops of the United States may be ready to occupy the fortresses as soon as they shall 
be abancloned by those of his Britannic Majesty. 

You will propose to General Haldirnand, an exchange 
of such arlillcry and stores now in the posts as you 
shall think proper, and which you shall judge will be 
ol" benefit to the United States, agreeing with the British commander-in-chief, that an equal number of cannon, and an ecjual cjuantity and kind of stores, to what 
he may consent to exchange, shall be replaced to his 
Britannic Majesty by the United States, at such time 
and place as shall be fixed on by you for the purpose. 

Having formed your arrangements with General Haldirnand, you will be pleased to proceed, in such manner as you shall think best, to visit the several posts 
and fortresses on the h'ontier territory of the United 
States as far as Detroit. View their diflerent situation, strength, and circumstances ; and, forming your 
judgment of their relative jjosition, and probable advantages to the United States, you will report the same to 
me, with your opinion of such of them as you shall 
think it most expedient for the United States to retain 
and occupy. In passing Lake Champlain you will critically observe the width of the waters at the northern 
extremity, and the nature of the ground adjoining ; 
with a view to determine whether there is any spot 
south of the 45th degree of north latitude, and near 
our extreme boundary, on which it will be convenient, 
should Congress judge it expedient, to erect fortifications, which would command the entrance from Canada 
into that lake. 

At Detroit you will find a very considerable settlement, consisting mostly of French people from Canada. To these you will please to intimate in the fullest 
manner the good disposition of Congress and the 
inhabitants of the United States for their welfare and protection; expressing at the same time to them our 
expectations of finding the like disposition in them lowards us, and the post which we may establish there, 
and any future settlement which may be formed in 
their neiglibourhood by the subjects of the United 
States. As the advanced season, or other unforeseen 
accidents, may render it difficult to get a detachment 
of American troops to that place before it may be convenient for the British garrison to be withdrawn from 
that post, you will do well to engage, in this case, some 
one or more of the respectable and well disposed inhabitants of the district to provide a company of militia (if there be any) or others, at the expense of the 
United States, to take charge of the works and buildings of the fortress, assuring them such reasonable pay 
as shall be deemed adequate to their service, or as 
you may condition for. You will also make particular 
inquiry, whether the farmers or merchants at Detroit 
are able or willing to supply an American garrison at 
that post with provisions and other necessaries, and 
upon what terms. 

You will please to keep me informed as fully as you 
can, and as often as opportunity will permit, of the 
progress you shall make in executing the business committed to your conduct. 

Confiding perfectly in your general knowledge, your 
sense, judgment, and discretion, in the fulfilment of this 
commission, I forbear any further detail of instructions ; 
but wish you success in your negotiations, with pleasure and security in the prosecution of your tour. Given at Head -Quarters, Newburg, this 12th day of July, 
1783.

TO PHILIP SCIIUYI.EIl. 

Hcad-Ciuartcrs, Ncwburg, 15 July, 1783. 

Df.ak Sir, 

I have always entertained a great desire to see the northern part of this State, before I returned to the southward. The present iriisome interval, while we 
are waiting for the definitive treaty, affords an opportunity of gratifying this inclination. I have therefore concerted with Governor Clinton to make a tour to 
reconnoitre those places, where the most remarkable posts were established, and the ground which became famous by being the theatre of action in 1777. On 
our return from thence, we propose to pass across the Mohawk River, in order to have a view of that tract of country, which is so much celebrated for the 
fertility of its soil and the beauty of its situation. We shall set out by water on Friday the 18th, if nothing should intervene to prevent our journey. 

Mr. Dimler, assistant quartermaster-general, who will have the honor of delivering this letter, precedes us to make arrangements, and particularly to have some 
light boats provided and transported to Lake George, that we may not be delayed on our arrival there. 

I pray you, my dear Sir, to be so good as to advise Mr. Dimler in what manner to proceed in this business, to excuse the trouble I am about to give 
you, and to be persuaded that your kind information and direction to the bearer will greatly increase the obligations, with which I have the honor to be, &c. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, IG July, 1783. 

Sir, 
The enclosed memorial was handed to me from some 
officers of Hazen's regiment, refugees from Canada. 
Anxious for their relief from the most distressing situation, and finding myself without the means or the 
power of doing it, I beg leave to refer their circumstances to the particular attention and regard of Congress. These, with many others, they will say, are the 
men who have left their country, their friends, their 
substance, their all, in support of the liberties of America ; and have followed our fortunes through the various 
scenes of a distressing contest, until they find it to 
have terminated in the happiest manner for all but 
themselves. Some provision is certainly due to those 
people, who now are exiled from their native country 
and habitations, without any mention made of them in 
the treaty, any stipulation for their return, or any means 
for their subsistence, in a country which their arms have 
contributed to secure and establish. When Congress 
recollect the encouragements, the promises, and assurances, which were published by them and by their orders 
in Canada in the years 1775 and 1776, I am persuaded 
they will take into their most serious consideration the 
case of those unhappy persons, who placed confidence 
in those proclamations, and make ample amends by some effectual provision for their sufferings, patience, 
and perseverance. 

I would not presume to dictate ; but, if Congress cannot procure liiiuls for their compensation and subsistence from the ample confiscations, which are making 
within the different States, I should think a grant could be made to them from iIr- unlocated lands in the interior part of our territory, and some means advanced 
to place them on such a tract. This perhaps might 
prove satisfactory, and would enable them to form a 
settlement, which may be beneficial to themselves, 
and useful to the United States. I will say no more, 
but repeat my recommendation of their case to the 
grateful remembrance of Congress, and beg, that a 
speedy attention may be given to the application, which 
I have advised them to make without delay. 

Finding myself in most disagreeable circumstances 
here, and likely to be, so long as Congress are pleased 
to continue me in this awkward .situation, anxiously 
expecting the definitive treaty ; without command, and 
with little else to do, than to be teased with troublesome applications and fruitless demands, which I have 
neither the means nor the power of satisfying ; in this 
distressing tedium I have resolved to wear away a little time, in performing a tour to the northward, as far 
as Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and perhaps as far 
up the Mohawk River as Fort Schuyler. I shall leave 
this place on Friday next, and shall probably be gone 
about two weeks, unless my tour should be interrupted 
by some special recall. One gentleman of my family 
will be left here to receive any letters or commands, 
and to forward to me any thing that shall be necessary. With great respect and esteem, I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO JAMES MCHEXRY, IN CONGRESS. 

Head-Quarters, 6 August, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

After a tour of at least seven hundred and fifty 
miles, performed in nineteen days, I returned to this 
place yesterday afternoon, where I found your favor of 
the 31st ultimo, intimating a resolution of Congress for 
calling me to Princeton, partly, as it would seem, on 
my own account, and partly for the purpose of giving 
aid to Congress ; but the President not having sent on 
the resolution, I am left ignorant of the particular objects Congress have in view, any further than can be 
collected from the expressions of his and your letters. 
So far then, as they may relate to a peace establishment, my sentiments in the fullest manner have been 
communicated to a committee, of which Colonel Hamilton was chairman. If the principal object in view, 
by my attendance, respects Congress, I cannot hesitate 
a moment to make the earliest compliance in my 
power. But, if the resolution is calculated for my own 
convenience, I cannot say, that it will render my situation more eligible than the present, especially taking 
into consideration the inconvenience of a removal for 
so small a distance, and a new establishment of a 
household, which must be formed in consequence of 
breaking up the menial part of my family here. 

My principal intention, in my letter of the 16th ultimo, was to express the disagreeableness of my present situation, waiting as I am, with little business and 
less command, for the definitive treaty, when I have 
so anxious a desire of retiring from public business, 
and reestabUshing myself in domestic life, where my 
private concerns call loudly for my presence. 

I wish you, therefore, my dear Sir, to transmit to me by the earliest opportunity a copy of the resolution, uitli an explanation of the particular reasons and 
principal motives, which have inlluenced Congress to 
pass it, that I may be enabled to regulate my conduct accordingly. I am, &,c.

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

IIcad-Q,uarters, 6 August, 1783. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's several favors of the 17th, 2 1th, 
and 31st of July, were received at head-quarters during my absence, and have been presented to me on 
my return last evening, which I effected by water from 
Albany. 

My tour having been extended as far northward as Crown Point, and westward to Fort Schuyler and its 
district, and my movements having been pretty rapid, my horses, which are not yet arrived, will be so much 
fatigued, that they will need some days to recruit This circumstance, with some arrangements that will 
be necessary previous to my leaving this place, will prevent my complying with the pleasure or Congress, 
intimated in yours of the 31st, so soon perhaps as may be expected. In the mean time, your Excellency will 
have an opportunity to transmit to me the resolution mentioned, that I may be acquainted" with the objects 
Congress have in view, by my attendance at Princeton, and that I may prepare myself to fulfil their expectations to the utmost of my power. 

Another Letter of the same date. — I was the more 
particularly induced by two considerations to make the 
tour, which, in my letter of the 16th ultimo, I informed 
Congress I had in contemplation, and from which I 
returned last evening. The one was an inclination 
to see the northern and western posts of this State, 
with those places which have been the theatre of important military transactions; the other, a desire to facilitate, as far as is in my power, the operations, which 
will be necessary for occupying the posts which are 
ceded by the treaty of peace, as soon as they shall 
be evacuated by the British troops. 

Aware of the difficulties we shall have to encounter 
in accomplishing the last mentioned object, on account 
of the advanced season, and the want of money to give 
vigor to our movements, I inserted a clause in the instructions to Baron Steuben, a copy of which I have 
the honor to enclose, authorizing him, in case those 
difficulties should be insurmountable, or in case the 
airival of the definidve treaty should be delayed beyond expectation, to agree with some of the respectable and well affected inhaliitants of Detroit to preserve 
the fortifications and public buildings at that place, 
until such time as a garrison could be sent with provisions and stores sufficient to take and hold possession 
of them. The propriety of this measure has appeared in a more forcible point of lij^ht, since I have been uj) 
the Mohawk River, and taken a view of the situation 
of things in that (juarUT ; for, upon a careful inquiry, 
I find it is tiie opinion of those, who are best acquainted 
with the distances and communications, that nothing 
short of the greatest exertions, and a sum adequate 
to the transportation, can even at this season furnish 
us with boats, and enable us to forward provisions and 
stores sullicient for a garrison to be supported at Detroit during the ensuing winter ; and, that without an 
immediate supply of money, it would be in vain to 
make the attempt. 

Inlluenced by this information, believing there was 
not a moment to be lost, and apprehending that Baron 
Steuben might be retarded in his progress by some 
unforeseen event, I engaged at Fort Rensselaer a gentleman, whose name is Cassaty, formerly a resident at 
Detroit, and who is well recommended, to proceed 
without loss of time, find out the disposition of the inhabitants, and make every previous inquiry, which might 
be necessary for the information of the Baron on his 
arrival, that he should be able to make such final arrangements, as the circumstances might appear to justify. This seemed to be the best alternative on failure 
of furnishing a garrison of our own troops ; which, for 
many reasons, would be infinitely the most eligible 
mode, if the season and your means would possibly 
admit. 

I have at the same time endeavoured to take the 
best preparatory steps in my power for supplying all 
the garrisons on the western waters by the provision 
contract. I can only form my magazine at Fort Herkimer, on the German Flats, which is thirty-two miles 
by land and almost fifty by water from the carryingplace between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek. 

The route by the former is impracticable in its present 
state for carriages ; and by the other extremely difhcult for batteaux, as the river is very much obstructed 
with fallen and floating trees, from the long disuse of 
the navigation. That nothing, however, which depends 
upon me, might be left undone, I have directed ten 
months' provision for five hundred men to be laid up 
at Fort Herkimer, and have ordered Colonel Willett, 
an active and good officer commanding the troops of 
this State, to repair the roads, remove the obstructions 
in the river, and, as far as can be effected by the labors of the soldiers, build houses for the reception of 
the provisions and stores at the carrying-place, in order 
that the whole may be in perfect readiness to move 
forward, so soon as the arrangement shall be made with 
General Haldimand. I shall give instructions to MajorGeneral Knox, to have such ordnance and stores forwarded to Albany, as in the present view of matters 
may be judged necessary for the western posts ; and I 
will also write to the quartermaster-general, by this 
conveyance, on the subject of batteaux and the other 
articles, which may be required from his department. 
However, as I before observed, without money to provide some boats, and to pay the expense of transportation, it will be next to impossible to get these things 
even to Niagara. I have the honor to be, &c.

By the last post I was honored with your Excellency's favor of the 1st instant, enclosing the resolve 
of Congress directing my attendance at Princeton. 

Notwithstanding my horses had arrived hut a day 
or two before, I should have set out immediately, had 
it not been for the indisposition of Mrs. Washington, 
who had been seized with a fever during my absence, 
has had a return of it since, and is now very weak and 
low. This circumstance, together with a desire of 
packing my papers and making arrangements for a 
final remove, (being uncertain of the objects Congress 
have in view, or how long I may be detained at Princeton,) will, I hope, avail as an excuse for my delay. 

I propose to set out on Monday next, provided Mrs. Washington's health will admit, or I should have 
nothing from Congress in the mean time, which should 
prevent the execution of my intentions. I am, &lc.

Notwithstamliiii^ Conn;rcss seem to estimate tlic value of my lil'e beyoiul any services I have been al)lo to

presage of our future happiness. 

Highly gratified by the favorable sentiments, which 
Congress are pleased to express of my past conduct, 
and amply rewarded by the confidence and affection of my fellow citizens, I cannot hesitate to contribute my best endeavours towards the establishment 
of the national security, in whatever manner the sovereign power may think proper to direct, until the 
ratification of the definitive treaty of peace, or the final 
evacuation of our country by the British forces ; after 
either of which events, I shall ask permission to retire 
to the peaceful shades of private life. 

Perhaps, Sir, no occasion may offer more suitable 
than the present, to express my humble thanks to God, 
and my grateful acknowledgments to my country, for 
the great and uniform support I have received in every 
vicissitude of fortune, and for the many distinguished 
honors, which Congress have been pleased to confer 
upon me in the course of the war.

Rocky Hill, 31 August, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

I received your favor of the 26th, and am much 
obliged by your attention in procuring the articles I 
had requested. I am also glad to find there is at 
length a prospect, that the British will in reality soon 
take their departure from the United States. 

Whatever my private sentiments as an individual 
may be respecting the violent policy, which seems in 
some instances to be adopted, it is not for us, as military characters, to dictate a different line of conduct. 
But I should suppose the encouragement you have 
given to those British and foreign soldiers, who have 
been discharged, that they would be permitted to remain in the country, was very unexceptionable and 
proper. The same indulgence, however, cannot be 
extended to such natives of the country as have served 
in their new corps, without the particular interference 
of the States to which they belong. And I think it 
necessary you should be advised, that granting passports to citizens, of any description, for the purpose 
of giving protection in coming from New York into the 
country, may not only be considered as an assumption 
beyond the limits of any commission, which has been 
derived from Congress, but will probably be productive of altercations with the civil powers, and at the 
same time involve us in very disagreeable consequences in many other respects. I am, dear Sir, with very 
great esteem yours, &c.

a repetition of them therefore by me would be unnecessary. But, independent of the ar,u;uments made 
use of by him, the following considerations have no 
small weight in my mind. 

To suffer a wide-extended country to be overrun 
with land jobbers, speculators, and monopolizers, or 
even with scattered settlers, is in my opinion inconsistent with that wisdom and policy, which our true interest dictates, or which an enlightened people ought to 
adopt ; and, besides, it is pregnant of disputes both with 
the savages and among ourselves, the evils of which 
are easier to be conceived than described. And for 
what, but to aggrandize a few avaricious men, to the 
prejudice of many and the embarrassment of government ? For the people engaged in these pursuits, without contributing in the smallest degree to the support 
of government, or considering themselves as amenable to its laws, will involve it, by their unrestrained conduct, in inextricable perplexities, and more than probably in a great deal of bloodshed. 

My ideas, therefore, of the hne of conduct proper 
to be observed, not only towards the Indians but for 
the government of the citizens of America, in their 
settlement of the western country, which is intimately 
connected therewith, are simply these. 

First, and as a preliminary, that all prisoners, of 
whatever age or sex, among the Indians, shall be delivered up. 

That the Indians should be informed, that, after a 
contest of eight years for the sovereignty of this country, Great Britain has ceded all the lands to the United 
States within the limits described by the article of the 
provisional treaty. 

That as they (the Indians), maugre all the advice 
and admonition that could be given them at the commencement and during the prosecution of the war, 
could not be restrained from acts of hostility, but were 
determined to join their arms to those of Great Britain 
and to share their fortunes, so consequently, with a less 
generous people than Americans, they would be made 
to share the same fate, and be compelled to retire along 
with them beyond the Lakes. But, as we prefer peace 
to a state of warfare; as we consider them as a deluded 
people; as we persuade ourselves that they are convinced, from experience, of their error in taking up the 
hatchet against us, and that their true interest and safety 
must now depend upon our friendship ; as the country 
is large enough to contain us all; and as we are disposed 
to be kind to them and to partake of their trade, we 
will, from these considerations and from motives of compassion, draw a veil over what is past, and establish a 
boundary line between them and us, beyond which we will endeavour to restrain our people from hunting or 
settling, and within which they shall not come but for 
the purposes of trading, treating, or other hu.siness 
unexcepiioiiuble in its nature. 

In establishing this line, in the first instance, care 
should be taken neither to yield nor to grasp at too 
much ; but to endeavour to impress the Indians with 
an idea of the generosity of our disposition to accommodate them, and of the necessity we are under, of 
proviiling for our waixiors, our young people who are 
growing up, and strangers who are coming from other 
countries to live among us ; and if they should make a 
point of it, or appear dissatisfied with the line we may 
find it necessary to establish, compensation should be 
made to them for their claims within it. 

It is needless for me to express more explicitly, because the tendency of my observations evinces it is my 
opinion, that, if the legislature of the State of New York 
shoulil insist upon expelling the Six Nations from all 
the country they inhabited previous to the war, within 
their territory, as General Schuyler seems to be apprehensive, it will end in another Indian war. I have every 
reason to believe from my inquiries, and the information 
I have receiveil, that they will not sufl'er their country 
(if it were our policy to take it before we could settle 
it) to be wrested from them without another struggle. 
That they would compromise for a part of it, I have 
very little doubt ; and that it would be the cheapest way 
of coming at it, I have no doubt at all. The same observations, I am persuaded, will hold gooil \\ ith respect 
to Virginia, or any other State, which has powerful tribes 
of Indians on its frontiers; and the reason of my mentioning New York is because General Schuyler has 
expressed his opinion of the temper of its legislature, 
and because I have been more in the way of learning 
the sentiments of the Six Nations on the subject, than 
of any other tribes of Indians. 

The hmits being suthciently extensive, in the new 
country, to comply with all the engagements of government, and to admit such emigrations as may be supposed to happen within a given time, not only from the 
several States of the Union but from foreign countries, 
and, moreover, of such magnitude as to form a distinct 
and proper government; a proclamation, in my opinion, should issue, making it felony (if there is power for 
the purpose, if not, imposing some very heavy restraint) 
for any person to survey or settle beyond the line ; and 
the officers commanding the frontier garrisons should 
have pointed and peremptory orders to see that the 
proclamation is carried into eirect. 

Measures of this sort would not only obtain peace 
from the Indians, but would, in my opinion, be the 
surest means of preserving it ; and would dispose of 
the land to the best advantage, people the counti-y progressively, and check land jobbing and monopolizing, 
which are now going forward with great avidity, while 
the door would be open and the terms known for every 
one to obtain what is proper and reasonable for himself, 
upon legal and constitutional ground. 

Every advantage, that could be expected or even 
wished for, would result from such a mode of procedure. Our settlements would be compact, government 
well established, and our barrier formidable, not only for 
ourselves but against our neighbours ; and the Indians, 
as has been observed in General Schuyler's letter, will 
ever retreat as our settlements advance upon them, and 
they will be as ready to sell, as we are to buy. That 
it is the cheapest, as well as the least distressing way 
of dealing with them, none, who is acquainted with the 
nature of Indian warfare, and has ever been at the 
trouble of cstimntins the oxponsc of ono, and comparinj5 it wiili llic cost of piircliasing their laiuls, will hesitate to acknowledge. 

Unless some such measures, as I have here taken 
the lihcrty of su^gostinii, are speedily adopted, one of 
two capitiil evils, in my opinion, will inevitably result, 
and is near at hand ; either the settling, or rather overspreading, of the western country will take place by a 
parcel of banditti, who will bid defiance to all authority, 
while they are skimming and disposing of the cream of 
the country at the expense of many suflering officers 
and soldiers, who have fought and bled to obtain it, and 
■.\re now waiting the decision of Congress to point them 
to the promised reward of their past dangers and toils ; 
or a renewal of hostilities with the Indians, brought 
about more than probably by this very means. 

How fiu- agents for Indian aflairs are indispensably 
necessary, I shall not take upon me to decide ; but, if 
any should be appointed, their powers should be circumscribed, accurately defined, and themselves rigidly 
punished for every infraction of them. A recurrence 
to the conduct of these people, under the British administration of Indian atTairs, will manifest the propriety 
of this caution, as it will there be found that self-interest 
was the principle by which their agents were actuated ; 
and to promote this by accumulating lands and passing 
large quantities of goods through their hands, the Indians were made to speak any language they pleased 
bv their representation, and were pacific or hostile as 
their purposes were most likely to be promoted by the 
one or the other. No purchase under any pretence 
whatever should be made by any other authority than 
that of the sovereign power, or the legislature of the 
State in which such lands may happen to be ; nor 
should the agents be permitted directly or indirectly 
to trade, but have a fixed and ample salary allowed 
them, as a full compensation for their trouble. 

Whether in practice the measure may answer as 
well as it appears in theory to me, I will not undertake 
to say ; but I think, if the Indian trade was conducted 
on government account, and with no greater advance 
than what would be necessary to defi-ay the expense 
and risk, and bring in a small profit, that it would supply the Indians on much easier terms than they usually 
are, engross their trade, and fix them strongly in our 
interest, and would be a much better mode of treating 
them, than that of giving presents, where a few only 
are benefited by them. I confess there is a difficulty 
in getting a man, or set of men, in whose abiUties 
and integrity there can be a perfect reliance, without 
which the scheme is liable to such abuse as to defeat 
the salutary ends, which are proposed from it. At any 
rate, no person should be suffered to trade with the 
Indians without first obtaining a license, and giving security to conform to such rules and regulations as shall 
be prescribed, as was the case before the war. 

In giving my sentiments in the month of May last 
(at the request of a committee of Congress) on a peace 
establishment, I took the liberty of suggesting the propriety, which in my opinion there appeared, of paying 
particular attention to the French and other settlers at 
Detroit and other parts within the limits of the western country. The perusal of a late pamphlet, entitled 
" Observations on the Commerce of the American 
States with Europe and the West Indies," impresses 
the necessity of it more forcibly than ever on my mind. 
The author of that piece strongly recommends a liberal 
change in the government of Canada ; and, though he is 
too sanguine in his expectations of the benefits arising 
from it, there can be no doubt of the good policy of the measure. It belioves us, therefore, to counteract 
them by anticipation. These people have a disposititJii 
towards us susceptible of favorable impressions ; but, 
as no arts will be left unattempted by the British to 
withilraw them from our interest, the present moment 
should be employed by us to fix them in it, or we may 
lose them for ever, and with them the advantages 
consequent on the choice they may make. From the 
best information and maps of that country it would 
appear, that tiie tciritory from the mouth of the Great 
Miami River, which empties into the Ohio, to its confluence with the INIad River, thence by a line to the 
Miami fort and village on the other Miami River, which 
empties into Lake Eric, and thence by a line to include 
the settlement of Detroit, would, with Lake Erie to the 
northward, Pennsylvania to the eastward, and the Ohio 
to the southward, form a government sufficiently extensive to fulfil all the public engagements, and to receive moreover a large population by emigrants ; and 
to confine the setdement of the new State within these 
bounds would, in my opinion, be infinitely better, even 
supposing no disputes were to happen with the Indians, 
and that it was not necessary to guard against these 
other evils that have been enumerated, than to suffer 
the same number of people to roam over a country of 
at least five hundred thousand square miles, contributing 
nothing to the support, but much perhaps to the embarrassment, of the federal government. 

Were it not for the purpose of comprehending the 
settlement of Detroit within the jurisdiction of the new 
government, a more compact and better shaped district 
for a State would be, for the line to proceed from the 
Miami fort and village along the river of that name to 
Lake Erie ; leaving in that case the settlement of Detroit, and all the territory north of the rivers Miami 
and St. Joseph's between the Lakes Erie, St. Clair, 
Huron, and Michigan to form hereafter another State 
equally large, compact, and water-bounded. 

At first view it may seem a little extraneous, when 
I am called on to give an opinion upon the terms of a 
peace proper to be made with the Indians, that I should 
go into the formation of new States. But the settlement of the western country, and making a peace with 
the Indians, are so analogous, that there can be no 
considerations of the one, without involving those of 
the other ; for, I repeat it again, and I am clear in my 
opinion, that policy and economy point very strongly to 
the expediency of being upon good terms with the Indians, and the propriety of pm-chasing their lands in 
preference to attempting to drive them by force of arms 
out of then- country ; which, as we have already experienced, is like driving the wild beasts of the forest, 
which will return as soon as the pursuit is at an end, 
and faO perhaps upon those that are left there ; when 
the gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire ; both being 
animals of prey, though they differ in shape. In a 
word, there is nothing to be obtained by an Indian war, 
but the soil they live on, and this can be had by purchase at less expense, and without that bloodshed and 
those distresses, which helpless women and children 
are made partakers of in all kinds of disputes with 
them. 

If there is any thing in these thoughts, which I have 
fully and freely communicated, worthy of attention, I 
shall be happy, and am, Sir, your most obedient and 
most humble servant.

Rocky Hill, U September, 1783. 

My DEAK Sin, 

It was with great concern I heard of your indisposiiit)i>. Later accounts say you were on the recovery, 
and nothing would give me more pleasure, than the 
confirmation of it, from under your own hand. 

I am not able to give you any information on the 
point you requested at our parting. Congress have 
come to no determination yet, respecting a peace 
establishment, nor am I able to say when they will. 
I have lately had a conference with a committee on 
this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, 
but it appears to me, that there is not a suflicient 
representation to discuss great national points ; nor do 
I believe there will be, while that honorable body continue their sessions at this place. The want of accommodation, added to a disinclination in the southern 
delegates to be further remove.! than they formerly 
were from the centre of the emp'u-e, and an aversion 
in the others to ^Ive up what they conceive to be a 
point gained by the late retreat to this place, keep 
matters in an awkward situation, to the very great interruption of national concerns. Seven States, it seems, 
by the articles of confederation, must agree, before any 
place can be fixed upon for the seat of the federal 
government ; and seven States, it is said, never will 
agree ; consequently, as Congress came here, here 
they are to remain to the dissatisfaction of the majority and a great let to business, having none of the public 
offices about them, nor any places to accommodate 
them, if they were brought up ; and the members, from 
this or some other cause, are eternally absent. With 
the sincerest esteem and regard, I am, dear Sir, &c.

TO LUND WASHINGTON. 

Rocky Hill, 20 September, 1783. 

Dear Lund, 

Mrs. Custis has never suggested in any of her letters 
to Mrs. Washington (unless ardent wishes for her return, that she might then disclose it to her, can be so 
construed) the most distant attachment to D. S. ; but, 
if this should be the case, and she wants advice upon 
it, a father and mother, who are at hand and competent 
to give it, are at the same time the most proper to be 
consulted on so interesting an event. For my own 
part, I never did, nor do I believe I ever shall, give 
advice to a woman, who is setting out on a matrimonial 
voyage ; first, because I never could advise one to 
marry without her own consent ; and, secondly, because I know it is to no purpose to advise her to refrain, when she has obtained it. A woman very rarely 
asks an opinion or requires advice on such an occasion, 
till her resolution is formed ; and then it is with the 
hope and expectation of obtaining a sanction, not that 
she means to be governed by your disapprobation, 
that she appUes. In a word, the plain English of the 
application may be summed up in these words ; " I wish 
you to think as I do ; but, if unhappily you differ from 
me in opinion, my heart, I must confess, is fixed, and I 
have gone too far 71010 to retract." 

If Mrs. Custis should ever suggest any thing of this 
kind to me, I will give her my opinion of the measure, 
not of the man, with candor, and to the following effect. 
" I never expected you would spend the residue of 
your days in widowhood ; but in a matter so important, 
and so interesting to yourself, children, and connexions, 
I wish you would make a prudent choice. To do which, 
many considerations are necessary ; such as the family and connexions of tht; man, his fortune (which is not 
tiie most usst'iitiai in my eye), the line of conduct he 
has observed, antl the disposition and ti-ame of his 
mind. You sliould consider what prospect there is 
of his provini? kind and aflectionatc to you ; just, generous, and attentive to your children ; and iiow I'ar his 
connexions will be agreeable to you ; for when they 
are once formed, agreeable or not, the die being cast, 
your fate is fix(Ml." Thus far, and no ftvrther, I shall go 
iu my opinions. I am, dear Lund, &,c.

I do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
a copy of a letter I have received from Colonel Kosciuszko, on the subject of his promotion. The general 
promotion now before Congress, should it take place, 
would have included him ; but this does not seem to 
be his wish. As a foreigner, I suppose a particulai 
promotion would be more consonant to his views and

TO THE CHEVALIER DE CHASTELLUX. 

Princeton, 12 October, 1783. 

My dear Chevalier, 

I have not had the honor of a line from you since 
the 4th of March last ; but I will ascribe my disappointment to any cause, rather than to a decay of your 
friendship. 

Having the appearance, and indeed the enjoyment 
of peace, without a final declaration of it, I, who am 
only waiting for the ceremonials, or till the British forces 
shall have taken leave of New York, am placed in an 
awkward and disagreeable situation, it being my anxious 
desire to quit the walks of public life, and to seek those 
enjoyments and that relaxadon, which a mind, that has 
been constantly upon the stretch for more than eight 
years, stands so much in need of. 

I have fixed this epoch at the arrival of the definitive 
treaty, or the evacuation of my country by our newly 
acquired friends. In the mean while, at the request of 
Congress I spend my time with them at this place, 
where they came in consequence of the riots at Philadelphia, of which you have doubtless (for it is not a 
very recent transaction) been fully apprized. They 
have lately determined to make a choice of some convenient spot near the Falls of the Delaware for the 
permanent residence of the sovereign power of these 
United States ; but where they will hold their sessions 
till they can be properly established at that place, is 
yet undecided. 

I have lately made a tour through the Lakes George 
and Champlain, as far as Crown Point. Thence returning to Schenectady, I proceeded up the Mohawk 
River to Fort Schuyler (formerly Fort Stanwix), and 
crossed over to Wood Creek, which empties into the 
Oiiciila Luke, and allbrils the water commiinicatiim 
with Ontario. I then traversed tl)e counlry to the 
heail 1)1" the eastern l)raneh of the Siistjuehanna, and 
viewed the Lake Otsego, and the portage between 
that Lake and the Mohawk River at Canajoharie. 
Prompted by these actual observations, I could not 
help taking a more extensive view of the vast inland 
navigation of these United States, from maps and the 
information of others ; and could not but be struck 
with the immense extent and importance of it, and with 
the goodness of that Providence, which has dealt its 
favors to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God 
we may have wisdom enough to improve them. I sh;i]l 
not rest contented, till I have explored the western 
country, and traversed those lines, or great part of 
them, which have given hounds to a new empire. 
But when it may, if it ever shall, happen, I dare not 
say, as my first attention must be given to the deranged situation of my private concerns, which are not a 
httle injured by almost nine years' absence and total 
disregard of them. With every wish for your health 
and happiness, and with the most sincere and aflectionate regard, I am, my dear Chevalier, &,c.

Rocky Hill, I'.' October, 17ey. 

Dear Sir, 

General Laumoy and Colonel Gouvion did me justice in mentioning the regret I feel at your intention of 
leaving this country. The personal attachment, which 
naturally grows out of such a length of service together, had I no other motive, would occasion a regret at 
parting ; but it is considerably heightened by your quitting the service, and thereby depriving me of the 
hope of seeing you return to Ijenefit the country by 
your abilities and experience in your profession, if such 
an establishment, as this great empire ought to adopt 
for the peace of it, should be finally agreed to, but 
which at this moment is undecided. 

It would afford me much pleasure to tell you this 
personally before your departure ; but if I should not 
have this satisfaction, I beg you to be assured that you 
carry ^vith you every good wish I can form for you, and 
that I shall ever retain a grateful sense of the aids I 
have derived from your knowledge and advice, and 
more especially for the repeated testimonials I have received of your friendship and attachment to me.

I was extremely glad to hear by a letter from Colonel Varick, that though not yet restored to your usual

many circumstances I think it now pretty evident, that 
the British will leave New York in all next month. 
Sir Guy Carleton has informed me verbally, through 
Mr. Parker, that he expects to evacuate the city by the 
20th, and that, when the transports, which were gone to 
Nova Scotia, returned, he should be able to fix the day

and I am sorry to learn from it that you are still in such 
a low state of health. The propriety of putting the 
troops, who may move towards the city, under your 
Excellency's direction, strikes me very forcibly, and I 
have mentioned it in a postscript to the letter to General Knox. It will accordingly form part of the arrangement, which you may both agree on. I shiill with

FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES. 

Rocky Hill, near Princeton, 2 November, 1783. 

The United States in Congress assembled, after giving the most honorable testimony to the merits of the 
federal armies, and presenting them with the thanks of 
their country for their long, eminent, and faithful services, having thought proper, by their proclamation 
bearing date the 18th day of October last, to discharge 
such part of the troops as were engaged for the war, 
and to permit the officers on furloughs to retire from 
service, from and after to-morrow ; which proclamation 
having been communicated in the public papers for the 
information and government of all concerned, it only 
remains for the Commandcr-in-chiof to address himself 
once more, tmd that for the last time, to the armies of 
the United States (however widely dispersed the individuals wiio composed them may be), and to bid them 
an affectionate, a long farewell. 

But before the Commander-in-chief takes his final 
leave of those he holds most dear, he wishes to indulge himself a few moments in calliiig to mind a slight 
review of the past. He will then take the liberty of 
exploring with his military friends their future prospects, of advising the general line of conduct, which, 
in his opinion, ought to be pursued ; and he will conclude the address by expressing the obligations he feels 
himself under for the spirited and able assistance he has 
experienced from them, in the performance of an arduous office. 

A contemplation of the complete attainment (at a 
period earlier than could have been expected) of the 
object, for which we contended against so formidable a 
power, cannot but inspire us with astonishment and 
gratitude. The disadvantageous circumstances on our 
part, under which the war was undertaken, can never 
be forgotten. The singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could 
scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving ; 
while the unparalleled perseverance of the armies of 
the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long 
years, was little short of a standing miracle. 

It is not the meaning nor within the compass of this 
address, to detail the hardships peculiarly incident to 
our service, or to describe the distresses, which in 
several instances have resulted from the extremes of 
hunger and nakedness, combined with the rigors of an 
inclement season ; nor is it necessary to dwell on the 
dark side of our past affairs. Every American officer 
and soldier must now console himself for any unpleasant circumstances, which may have occurred, by a recollection of the uncommon scenes in which he has been 
called to act no inglorious part, and the astonisliins; 
events of which he has been a witness ; events, which 
have seldom, if ever before, taken place on the stage 
of human action ; nor can they probably ever happen 
again. For who has before seen a disciplined army 
formed at once from such raw maten;xls ? Who, that 
was not a witness, could imagine, that the most violent 
local prejudices would cease so soon ; and that men, 
who came from the diffi-rent parts of the continent, 
strongly disposed by the habits of education to despise 
and quarrel with each other, would instantly become but 
one patriotic band of brothers I Or who, that was not 
on the spot, can trace the steps by which such a wonderful revolution has been eirected, and such a glorious 
period put to all our warlike toils ? 

It is universally acknowledged, that the enlarged 
prospects of happiness, opened by the confirmation of 
our independence and sovereignty, almost exceed the 
power of description. And shall not the brave men, 
who have contributed so essentially to these inestimable 
acquisitions, retiring victorious from the field of war to 
the field of agriculture, participate in all the blessings, 
which have been obtained ? In such a republic, who 
will exclude them from the rights of citizens, and the 
fruits of their labor? In such a country, so happily 
circumstanced, the pursuits of commerce and the cultivation of the soil will unfold to industry the certain 
road to competence. To those hardy soldiers, who 
are actuated by the spirit of adventure, the fisheries 
will afford ample and profitable employment ; and the 
extensive and fertile regions of the West will yield a 
most happy asylum to those, who, fond of domestic 
enjoyment, are seeking for personal independence. Nor is it possible to conceive, that any one of the United 
States will prefer a national bankruptcy, and a dissolution of the Union, to a compliance with the requisitions of Congress, and the payment of its just debts ; 
so that the officers and soldiers may expect considerable 
assistance, in recommencing their civil occupations, from 
the sums due to them from the public, which must and 
will most inevitably be paid. 

In order to effect this desirable purpose, and to remove the prejudices, which may have taken possession 
of the minds of any of the good people of the States, 
it is earnestly recommended to all the troops, that, with 
strong attachments to the Union, they should carry with 
them into civil society the most conciliating dispositions, 
and that they should prove themselves not less virtuous 
and useful as citizens, than they have been persevering 
and victorious as soldiers. What though there should 
be some envious individuals, who are unwilling to pay 
the debt the public has contracted, or to yield the tribute due to merit ; yet let such unworthy treatment 
produce no invectives, nor any instance of intemperate 
conduct. Let it be remembered, that the unbiassed 
voice of the free citizens of the United States has 
promised the just reward and given the merited applause. Let it be known and remembered, that the reputation of the federal armies is established beyond the 
reach of malevolence ; and let a consciousness of their 
achievements and fame still incite the men, who composed them, to honorable actions ; under the persuasion that the private virtues of economy, prudence, and 
industry, will not be less amiable in civil life, than the 
more splendid qualities of valor, perseverance, and 
enterprise were in the field. Every one may rest assured, that much, very much, of the future happiness 
of the officers and men, will depend upon the wise and manly conduct, which slnill be adopted by them when 
they are mingled uitli tin; great body of the community. And, alUiough the General lias so frecjuently 
given it as his opinion in the most public and explicit 
miuuiLT, that, unless the principles of the Federal Government were properly supported, and the powers of 
the Union increased, the honor, dignity, and justice of 
the nation would be lost for ever ; yet he cannot help 
repeating, on this occasion, so interesting a sentiment, 
and leaving it as his last injunction to every olRcer and 
every soldier, who may view the subject in the same 
serious point of light, to add his best endeavours to 
those of his worthy fellow citizens towards eflecting 
these great and valuable purposes, on which our very 
existence as a nation so materially depends. 

The Commander-in-chief conceives little is now 
wanting, to enable the soldiers to change the military 
character into that of the citizen, but that steady and 
decent tenor of behaviour, which has generally distinguished, not only the army under his immediate command, but the ditl'crent detachments anil separate armies, through the course of the war. From their good 
sense and prudence he anticipates the happiest consequences ; and, while he congratulates them on the glorious occasion, which renders their services in the field 
no longer necessary, he wishes to express the strong 
obligations he feels himself under for the assistance he 
has received from every class and in every instance, 
lie presents his thanks in the most serious and affectionate manner to the general officers, as well for their 
counsel on many interesting occasions, as for their ardor in promoting the success of the plans he had adopted ; to the commandants of regiments and corps, and 
to the other officers, for their great zeal and attention 
in carrying his orders promptly into execution ; to the staff, for their alacrity and exactness in performing the 
duties of their several departments ; and to the noncommissioned officers and private soldiers, for their extraordinary patience and suffering, as well as their invincible fortitude in action. To the various branches of 
the army, the General takes this last and solemn opportunity of professing his inviolable attachment and 
friendship. He wishes more than bare professions were 
in his power ; that he were really able to be useful to 
them all in future life. He flatters himself, however, 
they will do him the justice to believe, that whatever 
could with propriety be attempted by him has been 
done. 

And being now to conclude these his last public 
orders, to take his ultimate leave in a short time of the 
military character, and to bid a final adieu to the armies he has so long had the honor to command, he can 
only again offer in their behalf his recommendations to 
their grateful country, and his prayers to the God of 
armies. May ample justice be done them here, and 
may the choicest of Heaven's favors, both here and 
hereafter, attend those, who, under the Divine auspices, 
have secured innumerable blessings for others. With 
these wishes and this benediction, the Commander-inchief is about to retire from service. The curtain of 
separation will soon be drawn, and the military scene 
to him will be closed for ever.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Rocky HiU, 6 November, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 3d of October, acquainting me with the arrangements your Excellency li;ul made for the removal of the troops and 
stores of his Britannic Majesty from the post of Penobscot. 

In consequence of the iiitiirmaiion, -^iven by your 
Excellency to Congress some lime past, that you had 
received orders for the evacuation of New York, antl 
of the verbal message you were pleased to send by 
Mr. Parker to me, respecting the period of embarkation, 
I am now induced to request, that you will be so obliging as to inform me of the particulai- time, or even the 
certain day, if possible, when this event will happen. 

This information would be extremely interesting for 
my private as well as public arrangements. Indeed, I 
should not have troubled your Excellency with the request, but for my peculiar circumstances and tln^ advanced season, which render it essential for me to be 
ascertained of the period of your embarkation, as early 
as may be convenient ; and which, I entreat, may be 
considered as my apology for the present application. 

Colonel Cobb, one of my aids-de-camp, will have the 
honor of delivering this letter, and of bearing your answer to me. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Sir, 

I had the honor yesterday to receive, by Major Beckwith, your Excellency's favor of the 12th. Today I will see the governor of this State, and concert with him the necessary arrangements for taking possession of the city of New York, and the other posts 
mentioned in your letter, at the times therein specified. For the information of which, you will please to accept my thanks. I have the honor to be, &,c.

Sir, 

I have at length the pleasure to inform your Excellency and Congress, that Sir Guy Carleton has 
fixed upon the time at which he proposes to evacuate the city of New York. The particulars are more 
fully explained in his letter of the 12th instant, f a 
copy of which, together with my answer, is enclosed. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

Haerlem, 22 November, 1783. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your Excellency's letter 
of the 19th instant; and for a reply to the proposition contained in it, I must beg leave to refer you Id his Excellency Governor Clinton, who will inform you by 
this conveyance, that the council instituted for the temporary i;()vernnu'nt of the State have acceded to )Our 
reservations, in full confidence that the embarkation 
will be expedited as much as the circumstances will 
admit. 

With regard to the information, that a deliberate 
combination has been formed to plunder the city of 
New York, I have to observe, that the intelligence 
appears to me not to be well-founded ; at least, no 
intimations of the kind had ever before come to my 
knowledge ; and I can assure your Excellency, that 
such arrangements have been made, as will, in my 
opinion, not only utterly discountenance, but effectually 
prevent, any outrage or disorder, unless the evacuation 
should be delayed until a much larger number of people shall be collected from the country, than have been 
assembled as yet for the purpose of going into town 
on its being relinquished by your troops ; in which case 
the difficulty of establishing civil government and maintaining good order may be greatly increased. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Walker will have the honor to 
deliver this letter to your Excellency, and to assure 
you of the respectful consideration with which 

I am. Sir, Sec

TO THOMAS MIFFLIN, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

New York, 3 December, 1783. 

Sir, 

In my last letter to your Excellency, I had the honor to acquaint Congi-ess with the arrangement Sir Guy Carleton had made for the evacuation of New York 
on the 2:kl ultimo. I liavc now to inform you, that 
the cmbaiivation was postponed two days on account 
of the badness of the weather. 

On the 2.5th of November the British troops left this 
citv, and a detaclimeut of our army marched into it. 
The civil power was immediately put in possession, and 
I have the happiness to assure you, that the most perfect regularity and good order have prevailed ever 
since ; on which pleasing events I congratulate your 
Excellency and Congress. A copy of the last letter 
I have received from Sir Guy Ciu-leton is enclosed.

Annapolia, 20 December, 1783. 

Sir,
 
I take the earliest opportunity to inform Congress of my arrival in this city, with the intention of asking 
leave to resign the commission I have the honor of 
holding in their service. It is essential for me to know 
their pleasure, and in what manner it will he most 
proper to offer my resignation, whether in writing, or 
at an audience. I shall therefore request to be honored with the necessary information, that, being apprized of the sentiments of Congress, I may regulate 
my conduct accordingly. I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Annapolis, 21 December, 1783. 

Sir, 

In my last despatch to your Excellency, I had the 
honor to inform Congress, that the American troops 
had taken possession of the city of New York, and had 
delivered it to the government of the State ; and that 
the British troops had retired to Staten and Long Islands. I had also the honor to enclose to you Sir Guy 
Carleton's last letter, informing me of his intention to 
take his final departure from the continent, with the 
troops under his command, on the 4th of this month. 

As there was no longer a necessity for retaining so 
many troops in service for the posts at present in our 
possession, and as the terms of service of the men 
were expiring so fast, that fifteen hundred or two 
thousand would have been discharged by June next, 
I thought it most consistent with the state of our public affairs to lessen the expense as soon as possible ; 
and I therefore gave directions to Major-General Knox 
before I left New York, to reduce the whole of the 
troops to one battalion of infantry of five hundred rank 
and file, and about one hundred artillery, and these 
to be of the men, who had the longest time to serve. 

To carry this arrangement into effect, and to collect 
and put into a state of preservation the ordnance and 
other valuable military stores belonging to the United 
States, it was necessary that there should be some 
officer of rank and abilities ; and, as the latter business 
was in the particular line of General Knox, and none 
understood or could attend to it so well, I directed that officer to continue in command, until the further 
pleasure of Congress should be made known to him.

Among the officers of the army, who have been 
obliged to retire at the conclusion ot" the war, are many, who, from various motives, are desirous of being arranged on any peace establishment that may take 
place. I take the liberty to lay before Congress the 
several applications, that have been made to me on the 
subject ; and in addition to the testimony, which accompanies them, I can only add mine, that most of the 
gentlemen whose names are on the list are personally 
known to me, as some of the best officers who were 
in the army. I am, &,c.

TO BARON STEUBEN. 

Annapolis, 23 December, 1783. 

My dear Baron, 

Although I have taken frequent opportunities, both 
in public and private, of acknowledging your great zeal, 
attention, and abilities, in performing the duties of your 
office ; yet I wish to make use of this last moment 
of my public life to signify, in the strongest terms, my 
entire approbation of your conduct, and to express my 
sense of the obligations the public is under to you, 
for your faithful and meritorious services. 

I beg you will be convinced, my dear Sir, that I 
should rejoice if it could ever be in my power to serve 
you more essentially, than by expressions of regard 
and affection ; but, in the mean time, I am persuaded 
you will not be displeased with this farewell token of my sincere friendship and esteem for you. 

This is the last letter I shall write, while I continue 
in the service of my country. The hour of my resignation is fixed at twelve to-day ; after which, I shall 
become a private citizen on the banks of the Potomac, where I shall be glad to embrace you, and testify the great esteem and consideration with which I 
am, my dear Baron, &.c.

GENERAL AVASHINGTOn's ADDRESS TO CONGRESS ON RESIGNING HIS COMMISSION. 

Annapolis, 23 December, 1783. 

Mr. President, 

The great events, on which my resignation depended, having at length taken place, I have now the honor 
of offering my sincere congratulations to Congress, and 
of presenting myself before them, to surrender into 
their hands the trust committed to me, and to claim 
the indulgence of retiring from the service of my 
country. 

Happy in the confirmation of our independence and sovereignty, and pleased with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming a respectable nation, I 
resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence ; a diffidence in my abilities to accomplish so arduous a task, which, however, was superseded 
by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause, the support of the supreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven. 

The successful termination of the war has verified 
the most sanguine expectations ; and my gratitude for 
the interposition of Providence, and the assistance I have received from my countrymen, increases with every review of the momentous contest. 

While I repeat my obligations to the army in general, I should do injustice to my own feelings not to 
acknowledge, in this place, the peculiar services and 
distinguished merits of the gentlemen, who have been 
attached to my person during the war. It was impossible that the choice of confidential officers to compose my family should have been more fortunate. Permit me. Sir, to recommend m particular those, who 
have continued in service to the present moment, as 
worthy of the favorable notice and patronage of Congress. 

I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last 
solemn act of my official hfe, by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence 
of them to his holy keeping. 

Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great dicatre of acdon ; and, bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body, under whose 
orders I have so long acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.
