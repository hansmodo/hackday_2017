</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In my last, by Mr. Stewart, I slightly mentioned the 
objection, which many had against enlisting, to wit, not 
knowing who was to be paymaster, or the times for 
payment. It is now grown a pretty general clamor ; 
and some of those, who were among the first enlisted, 
being needy, and knowing it to be usual for his Majesty's soldiers to be paid once a week, or at most every fortnight, are very importunate to receive their 
due. I have soothed and quieted them as much as 
possible, under pretence of receiving your instructions 
in this particular at the arrival of the colonel. 
</p><p>
I have increased my number of men to about 
twenty-five, and dare venture to say, that I should 
have had several more, if the excessive bad weather 
did not prevent their meeting agreeably to their officers' commands. 
</p><p>
We daily experience the great necessity for clothing the men, as we find the generality of those, who 
are to be enlisted, loose, idle persons, quite destitute 
of house and home, and, I may truly say, many of 
them of clothes ; which last renders them very incapable of the necessary service, as they must unavoidably be exposed to inclement weather in their marches, 
and can expect no other than to encounter almost 
every difficulty, that is incident to a soldier's life. 
There are many of them without shoes, others want 
stockings, some are without shirts, and not a few that 
have scarce a coat or waistcoat to their backs. In short, 
they are as ill provided as can well be conceived ; but I 
really believe every man of them, for his own credit's 
sake, is willing to be clothed at his own expense. They 
are perpetually teazing me to have it done, but I am not 
able to advance the money, provided there w r as no risk 
in it, which there certainly is, and too great for me to 
run ; though it would be nothing to the country, as a 
certain part of their pay might be deducted and appropriated to that use. Mr. Carlyle, or any of the merchants 
here, would furnish them with proper necessaries, if 
there was a certainty of any part of their pay being 
stopped to reimburse the expense. 
</p><p>
But I must here in time put a curb to my requests, 
and remember that I ought not to be too importunate ; 
otherwise I shall be as troublesome to you, as the soldiers are to me. Nothing but the necessity of the 
thing could urge me to be thus free ; but I shall no more 
press this affair, as I am well assured, that whatever you 
may think for the benefit of the expedition, you will 
cause to have done. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In a conversation with you at Green Spring, you 
gave me some room to hope for a commission above 
that of major, and to be ranked among the chief officers 
of this expedition. The command of the whole forces 
is what I neither look for, expect, nor desire ; for 1 
must be impartial enough to confess, it is a charge too 
great for my youth and inexperience to be entrusted 
with. Knowing this, I have too sincere a love for my 
country, to undertake that which may tend to the 
prejudice of it. But if I could entertain hopes, that you 
thought me worthy of the post of lieutenant-colonel, 
and would favor me so far as to mention it at the 
appointment of officers, I could not but entertain a true 
sense of the kindness. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself, that, under a skilful commander, or 
man of sense, (whom I most sincerely wish to serve 
under,) with my own application and diligent study of 
my duty, I shall be able to conduct my steps without 
censure, and, in time, render myself worthy of the 
promotion, that I shall be favored with now. I am, Sac.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter by Mr. Stewart, enclosing a lieutenant-colonel's commission, and I hope 
my future behaviour will sufficiently testify the true sense I have of this kindness.
</p><p>
At present there are about seventy-five men at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, near fifty of whom I have enlisted. The 
others have been sent by Messrs. Poison, Mercer, and 
Waggener to this place. Very few officers have repaired hither yet, which has occasioned a fatiguing time 
to me, in managing a number of self-willed, ungovernable people. I shall implicitly obey your commands, 
and march out with all expedition. Major Carlyle is 
now preparing wagons for the conveyance of provisions, 
which till now could not move, on account of the heavy 
roads. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor has been informed before 
this of Mr. Vanbraam's ill success in Augusta, by the 
express, who was sent from thence for that purpose. 
</p><p>
Major Muse's promotion, and Messrs. Rose and 
Bently's declining, will occasion a w r ant of officers ; in 
which case I would beg leave to mention Mr. Vanbraam for a command, who is the oldest lieutenant, 
and an experienced soldier. Unless the officers come 
in, I shall be obliged to appoint him to that office, till I 
have your Honor's further directions. It would be conferring a very great obligation on him, were you to 
confirm the appointment. I verily believe his behaviour 
would not render him displeasing to you. I have given 
Captain Stephen orders to be in readiness to join us at 
Winchester with his company, as they were already in 
that neighbourhood, and raised there. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to add at present, but my sincere thanks for the indulgent favors I have met with, 
and I am your Honor's most obedient, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, 25 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
Captain Trent's ensign, Mr. Ward, has this day arrived 
from the Fork of the Monongahela, and brings the disagreeable account, that the fort, on the 17th instant, 
was surrendered at the summons of Monsieur Centre cceur to a body of French, consisting of upwards of one 
thousand men, who came from Venango with eighteen 
pieces of cannon, sixty batteaux, and three hundred 
canoes. They gave him liberty to bring off all his men 
and working-tools, which he accordingly did the same day. 
</p><p>
Immediately upon this information I called a council 
of war, to advise on proper measures to be taken in this 
exigency. A copy of their resolves, with the proceedings, I herewith enclose by the bearer, whom I have 
continued express to your Honor for more minute 
intelligence. 
</p><p>
Mr. Ward has the summons with him, and a speech 
from the Half-King, which I also enclose, with the 
wampum. He is accompanied by one of the Indians 
mentioned therein, who were sent to see where we 
were, what was our strength, and to know the time to 
expect us out. The other young man I have prevailed 
upon to return to the Half- King with the following 
speech. 
</p><p>
" Sachems, Warriors of the Six United Nations, 
Shannoahs, and Delawares, our friends and brethren. I received your speech by the Buck's brother [Mr. Ward], 
who came to us with the two young men five sleeps 
after leaving you. We return you thanks from hearts 
glowing with affection for your steadfast adherence to 
us, for your kind speech, and for your wise counsels 
and directions to the Buck's brother. 
</p><p>
" The young man will inform you where he met a 
small part of our army advancing towards you, clearing 
the road for a great number of our warriors, who are 
immediately to follow with our great guns, our ammunition, and our provisions. 
</p><p>
" I could not delay to let you know our hearts, and 
have sent back one of the young men with this speech 
to acquaint you with them. I have sent the other, 
according to your desire, to the governor of Virginia, 
with the Buck's brother, to deliver your speech and 
wampum, and to be an eyewitness of the preparations 
we are making to come in haste to support you, whose 
interest is as dear to us as our lives. We resent the 
usage of the treacherous French, and our conduct will 
henceforth plainly show you how much we have it at 
heart. 
</p><p>
"I cannot be easy without seeing you before our 
forces meet at the fork of the roads, and therefore I 
have the greatest desire that you and Escuniate, or one 
of you, should meet me on the road as soon as possible 
to assist us in council. 
</p><p>
" To assure you of the good will we bear you, and to 
confirm the truth of what has been said, I herewith present to you a string of wampum, that you may thereby 
remember how much I am your brother and friend." 
</p><p>
I hope my proceedings in these affairs will be satisfactory to your Honor, as I have, to the utmost of my 
knowledge, consulted the interest of the expedition and 
good of my country ; whose rights, while they are asserted in so just a cause, I will defend to the last 
remains of life. 
</p><p>
Hitherto the difficulties I have met with in marching 
have been greater, than I expect to encounter on the 
Ohio, when possibly I may be surrounded by the enemy, 
and these difficulties have been occasioned by those, 
who, had they acted as becomes every good subject, 
would have exerted their utmost abilities to forward our 
just designs. Out of seventy-four wagons impressed 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, we got but ten after waiting a week, 
and some of those so badly provided with teams, that 
the soldiers were obliged to assist them up the hills, 
although it was known they had better teams at home. 
I doubt not that in some points I may have strained the 
law; but I hope, as my sole motive was to expedite the 
march, I shall be supported in it, should my authority 
be questioned, which at present I do not apprehend, 
unless some busybody intermeddles. 
</p><p>
Your Honor will see by the resolves in council, that I 
am destined to the Monongahela with all the diligent despatch in my power. We will endeavour to make the 
road sufficiently good for the heaviest artillery to pass, 
and, when we arrive at Red-stone Creek, fortify ourselves as strongly as the short time will allow. I doubt 
not that we can maintain a possession there, till we are 
reinforced, unless the rising of the waters shall admit 
the enemy's cannon to be conveyed up in canoes, and 
then I flatter myself we shall not be so destitute of 
intelligence, as not to get timely notice of it, and make 
a good retreat. 
</p><p>
I hope you will see the absolute necessity for our 
having, as soon as our forces are collected, a number 
of cannon, some of heavy metal, with mortars and grenadoes to attack the French, and put us on an equal 
footing with them. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may also be thought advisable to invite 
the Cherokees, Catawbas, and Chickasaws to march to 
our assistance, as we are informed that six hundred 
Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down Scioto 
Creek to join the French, who are coming up the Ohio. 
In that case I would beg leave to recommend their 
being ordered to this place first, that a peace may be 
concluded between them and the Six Nations; for I am 
informed by several persons, that, as no good harmony 
subsists between them, their coming first to the Ohio 
may create great disorders, and turn out much to our 
disadvantage. 
</p><p>
As I had opportunities I wrote to the governors 
of Maryland and Pennsylvania, acquainting them with 
these advices, and enclosed the summons and Indian 
speech, which I hope you will not think me too forward 
in doing. I considered that the Assembly of Maryland 
was to sit in five days, that the Pennsylvania Assembly 
is now sitting, and that, by giving timely notice, something might be done in favor of this expedition, which 
now requires all the force we can muster. 
</p><p>
By the best information I can get, I much doubt whether any of the Indians will be in to treat in May. 
Are the Indian women and children, if they settle amongst us, to be maintained at our expense ? They 
will expect it. I have the honor to be, &LC.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest concern I acquaint you, that 
Mr. Ward, ensign in Captain Trent's company, was 
compelled to surrender his small fort at the Fork of 
the Monongahela to the French, on the 17th instant, who 
fell down from Venango, with a fleet of three hundred 
and sixty batteaux and canoes, upwards of one thousand men, and eighteen pieces of artillery, which they 
planted against the fort, drew up their men, and sent 
the enclosed summons to Mr. Ward, who, having but an inconsiderable number of men, and no cannon, to 
make a proper defence, was obliged to surrender. 
They suffered him to draw off his men, arms, and 
working- tools, and gave leave that he might retreat 
to the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
I have heard of your Honor's great zeal for his Majesty's service, and for all our interests on the present 
occasion. You will see, by the enclosed speech of the 
Half-King, that the Indians expect some assistance from 
you ; and I am persuaded you will take proper notice 
of their moving speech, and their unshaken fidelity. 
</p><p>
I thought it more advisable to acquaint your Honor 
with it immediately, than to wait till you could get intelligence by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> and the young man, 
as the Half-King proposes. 
</p><p>
I have arrived thus far with a detachment of one hundred and fifty men. Colonel Fry, with the remainder 
of the regiment and artillery, is daily expected. In the 
mean time, we advance slowly across the mountains,, 
making the roads, as we march, fit for the carriage of our great guns ; and are designed to proceed as far as 
the mouth of Red-stone Creek, which enters the Monongahela about thirty-seven miles above the fort taken 
by the French, from whence we have a water carriage 
down the river. And there is a storehouse built by 
the Ohio Company, which may serve as a receptacle 
for our ammunition and provisions. 
</p><p>
Besides these French, that came from Venango, we 
have credible accounts, that another party are coming 
up the Ohio. We also have intelligence, that six hundred of the Chippewas and Ottawas are marching down 
Scioto Creek to join them. I hope your Honor will 
excuse the freedom I have assumed in acquainting you 
with these advices ; it was the warm zeal I owe my 
country, that influenced me to it, and occasioned this 
express. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect and regard, your Honor's 
most obedient and very humble servant.

SIR,

</p><p>
I acquainted you by Mr. Ward with the determination, which we prosecuted four days after his departure, 
as soon as wagons arrived to carry our provisions. 
The want of proper conveyances has much retarded 
this expedition, and at this time it unfortunately delays 
the detachment I have the honor to command. Even 
when we came to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, my disappointments 
were not less than before ; for there I expected to find a 
sufficient number of packhorses provided by Captain 
Trent, conformably to his promise, and to Major Carlyle's letters and my own, that I might prosecute my 
first intention with light, expeditious marches ; but instead 
of that, there was none in readiness, nor any in expectation that I could perceive, which reduced me to the 
necessity of waiting till wagons could be procured from the Branch, forty miles distant. However, in the mean 
time, I detached a party of sixty men to make and mend 
the road, which party since the 25th of April, and the 
main body since the 1st instant, have been laboriously 
employed, and have got no farther than these Meadows, 
about twenty miles from the New Store. We have 
been two days making a bridge across the river, and 
have not done yet.
</p><p>
The great difficulty and labor, that it requires to mend and alter the road, prevent our marching above two, 
three, or four miles a day ; and I fear, though no diligence shall be spared, that we shall be detained some 
considerable time before it can be made good for the 
carriage of the artillery with Colonel Fry. 
</p><p>
We daily receive intelligence from Ohio by one or 
another of the traders, who are continually retreating to 
the inhabitants with their effects. They all concur, that 
the French are reinforced with eight hundred men; 
and this day, by one Kalendar, I received an account, 
which he sets forth as certain, that there are six hundred at the Falls of the Ohio, from whence they intend 
to move up to the lower Shawnese Town, at the mouth 
of Scioto Creek, to erect fortresses. He likewise says, 
that the forces at the Fork are erecting their works with 
their whole strength ; and as he was coming he met at 
Mr. Gist's new settlement Monsieur La Force with four 
soldiers, who, under the specious pretence of hunting 
after deserters, were reconnoitring and discovering the 
country. He also brings the agreeable news, -that the 
Half-King has received, and is much pleased with, the 
speech I sent him, and is now upon his march with fifty 
men to meet us. The French down the river are sending presents and invitations to all the neighbouring 
Indians. 
</p><p>
We have heard nothing from the Catawbas, or any of 
the Southern Indians, though this is the time we mostly 
need their assistance. I have not above one hundred 
and sixty effective men with me, since Captain Trent's 
have left us, whom I discharged from this detachment, 
and ordered them to wait your commands at Captain 
Trent's ; for I found them rather injurious to the other 
men, than serviceable to the expedition, till they could 
be upon the same establishment with us, and come 
under the rigor of martial law. I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am heartily concerned, that the officers have such 
real cause to complain of the Committee's resolves ; and 
still more to find my inclinations prone to second their 
just grievances. 
</p><p>
I have endeavoured, as far as I was able, to see in the 
best light I could the trifling advantages that may accrue ; 
yet nothing prevents their throwing down their commissions, (with gratitude and thanks to your Honor, whose 
good intentions of serving us we are all well assured of,) 
but the approaching danger, which has too far engaged 
their honor to recede till other officers are sent in their 
room, or an alteration made regarding their pay, during 
which time they will assist with their best endeavours 
voluntarily, that is, without receiving the gratuity allowed 
by the resolves of the Committee. 
</p><p>
Giving up my commission is quite contrary to my 
intention. Nay, I ask it as a greater favor, than any 
amongst the many I have received from your Honor, to 
confirm it to me. But let me serve voluntarily ; then I 
will, with the greatest pleasure in life, devote my services to the expedition without any other reward, than 
the satisfaction of serving my country ; but to be slaving 
dangerously for the shadow of pay, through woods, 
rocks, mountains, I would rather prefer the great toil 
of a daily laborer, and dig for a maintenance, provided I 
were reduced to the necessity, than serve upon such 
ignoble terms ; for I really do not see why the lives of 
his Majesty's subjects in Virginia should be of less value, 
than of those in other parts of his American dominions ; 
especially when it is well known, that we must undergo 
double their hardship. 
</p><p>
I could enumerate a thousand difficulties that we have 
met with, and must expect to meet with, more than other 
officers who have almost double our pay ; but as I know 
you reflect on these things, and are sensible of the hardships we must necessarily encounter, it would be needless to enlarge. 
</p><p>
Besides, as I have expatiated fully (and, perhaps, too 
warmly) in a letter to Colonel Fairfax, who, I suppose, 
will accompany you to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, upon the motives 
that occasion these my resolves, I shall not trouble you 
with them ; for the subject leads me too far when I 
engage in it.
</p><p>
Another thing resolved by the Committee is, that only 
one sergeant and one corporal be allowed to a company ; 
with whom it is as much impossible to do the necessary 
duty, as it is to conquer kingdoms with my handful of 
men. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I find so many clogs upon the expedition, that I quite despair of success ; nevertheless, I 
humbly beg it, as a particular favor, that your Honor 
will continue me in the post I now enjoy, the duty 
whereof I will most cheerfully execute as a volunteer, 
but by no means upon the present pay. 
</p><p>
I hope what I have said will not be taken amiss; for I 
really believe, were it as much in your power, as it is 
your inclination, we should be treated as gentlemen and 
officers, and not have annexed to the most trifling pay, 
that ever W 7 as given to English officers, the glorious 
allowance of soldier's diet, a pound of pork, with 
bread in proportion, per day. Be the consequence what 
it will, I am determined not to leave the regiment, but 
to be amongst the last men that quit the Ohio, even if I 
serve as a private volunteer, which I greatly prefer to 
the establishment we are now upon. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Honor's favor by Mr. Ward, who 
arrived here last night, just as two Indians came to us 
from the Ohio. 
</p><p>
These Indians contradict the report of the French 
having received reinforcements, though they agree that 
eight hundred men are very shortly expected. Those 
on the spot are busily employed in erecting the fort, 
which they have removed to the point I recommended 
for the country's use, whose walls they have now made 
two fathoms thick, and raised them breast high. 
</p><p>
They are daily sending out scouts, some of whom 
about five days ago were seen within six or seven miles 
of our camp ; but as I did not receive timely notice of 
it, they may have escaped, unless they have fallen in 
with a party sent out about eight days ago to Red- stone 
Creek, to reconnoitre the country thereabouts, and to 
get intelligence of the motions of the French. 
</p><p>
It is imagined that the Half-King will be here in two 
or three days, but to hurry him I have sent the Indian, 
that came up with Mr. Ward, with a short speech, 
acquainting him with my desire of his coming as expeditiously as possible, to receive the speech which your 
Honor sent by Mr. Ward, and which Colonel Fry wrote 
me I was to deliver. When he arrives I will endeavour 
to send him on to meet you at Winchester. 
</p><p>
These Indians, and all the traders that I have been 
able to get any information from, of late, agree that it is 
almost impracticable to open a road, in which a wagon 
can pass from this to Red-stone Creek. But most of 
them assure me, that, except at one place, water carriage may be had down this river, which will be a most 
advantageous discovery if it proves true, as it will save 
forty miles' land carriage over almost impassable roads 
and mountains. 
</p><p>
The water is now so high, that we cannot possibly 
cross over with our men, which likewise secures us from 
any immediate attacks of the enemy. I have therefore 
resolved to go down the river to the fall, which is at the 
Turkey Foot, to inform myself concerning the nature 
and difficulty attending this fall. I have provided a 
canoe, and shall, with an officer and five men, set out 
upon this discovery to-morrow morning. 
</p><p>
Captain Trent's men, who by their refractory behaviour obliged me to separate them from the other 
soldiers, have now left the New Store and dispersed, 
contrary to my positive orders till they received your commands. 
</p><p>
As I shall have frequent communications with the 
Indians, which are of no effect without wampum, I hope 
you will order some to be sent. Indeed, we ought to 
have shirts, and many other things of this sort, which 
are always expected by every Indian that brings a message, or good report Also the chiefs, who visit and 
converse in council, look for the same. If it would not 
be thought too bold in me, I would recommend some 
of the treaty goods to be sent for that purpose with 
Colonel Fry, or after him. This is the method the 
French pursue, and a trifle judiciously bestowed, and in 
season, may turn to our advantage. If I find this river 
navigable, I am convinced it cannot but be agreeable to 
your Honor, that we should build canoes in order to 
convey our artillery down. As the road to this place is 
made as good as it can be, much time and great labor 
having been spent upon it, I believe a wagon may 
travel now with fifteen or eighteen hundred weight, by 
doubling the teams at one or two places only. I am, &c.

TO COLONEL JOSHUA FRY. 
</p><p>
23 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This day I returned from my discoveries down the 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a>, which, I am sorry to say, can never be 
made navigable. We traced the watercourse near 
thirty miles, with the full expectation of succeeding in 
the much desired aim ; but, at length, we came to a fall, 
which continued rough, rocky, and scarcely passable, for 
two miles, and then fell, within the space of fifty yards, 
nearly forty feet perpendicular. 
</p><p>
As I apprehended there would be difficulty in these 
waters, I sent the soldiers forward upon the road, when 
I left the camp, which was as soon as they could cross ; 
therefore, no time has been lost ; but the roads are so 
exceedingly bad, that we proceed very slow. 
</p><p>
By concurring intelligence, which we received from 
the Indians, the French are not above seven or eight 
hundred strong, and by a late account we are informed, 
that one half of them were detached in the night, without even the Indians' knowledge, on some secret expedition ; but the truth of this, though it is affirmed by an 
Indian lately from their fort, I cannot yet vouch for, nor tell where they are bound. 
</p><p>
I would recommend, in the strongest terms possible, 
your writing to the Governor for some of the treaty 
goods, or any others suitable for the Indians. Nothing 
can be done without them. All the Indians that come 
expect presents. The French take this method, which 
proves very acceptable; besides, if you want one or 
more to conduct a party, to discover the country, to 
hunt, or for any particular service, they must be bought ; 
their friendship is not so warm, as to prompt them to 
these services gratis ; and that, I believe, every person, 
who is acquainted with the nature of Indians, knows. 
The Indian, that accompanied me down the river, would 
go no further than the Forks, about ten miles, till I 
promised him a ruffled shirt, which I must take from my 
own, and a watch-coat. He said the French always 
had Indians to show them the woods, because they paid 
well for so doing; and this may be laid down as a 
standing maxim amongst them. I think were the goods 
sent out, and delivered occasionally, as you see cause, 
that four or five hundred pounds' worth would do more good, than as many thousands given at a treaty. 
</p><p>
I hope I may be excused for offering my opinions so 
freely, for I can aver we shall get no intelligence, or 
other services from them, unless we have goods to 
apply to these uses. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
On the 25th ultimo, by an express from Colonel Fry, 
I received the news of your arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and 
desire of seeing the Half-King and other chiefs of the 
Six Nations. I have by sundry speeches and messages 
invited him, Monacawacha, and others, to meet me, and 
have reason to expect the Half-King is on his way, as 
he only designed to settle his people to planting, at a 
place up the Monongahela chosen for that purpose. 
But fearing something might have retarded his march, 
I immediately, upon the arrival of the express, despatched a messenger with a speech. He is not yet 
returned. About four days ago I received a message from the Half- King to the following purport ; 
</p><p>
" To the first of his Majesty's officers, whom this may concern. 
</p><p>
" It is reported, that the French army is coming to 
meet Major George Washington. I exhort you, therefore, my brethren, to be on your guard against them, 
for they 'intend to strike the first English, whom they 
shall see. They have been on their march two days. 
I know not their number. The Half-King and the rest 
of the Chiefs will be with you in five days to hold a 
council. No more at present, but my remembrance to 
my brothers the English." 
</p><p>
His account was strengthened in the evening by 
another, that the French were at the Crossing of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a> about eighteen miles distant. I hereupon hurried to this place as a convenient spot. We have, with 
nature's assistance, made a good entrenchment, and, by 
clearing the bushes out of these meadows, prepared a 
charming field for an encounter. I detached, immediately upon my arrival here, a small light party of 
horse (wagon horses) to reconnoitre the enemy, and 
discover their strength and motion. They returned 
yesterday without having seen any thing of them; nevertheless, we were alarmed in the night, and remained 
under arms from two o'clock till near sunrise. We 
conceived them to be our own men, as six of them 
deserted, but cannot be certain whether it was they or 
our enemies. Be it as it will, they were fired at by my 
sentries, but I believe without damage. 
</p><p>
This morning Mr. Gist arrived from his place, where 
a detachment of fifty men was seen yesterday at noon, 
commanded by M. La Force. He afterwards saw their 
tracks within five miles of our camp. I immediately 
detached seventy-five men in pursuit of them, who, I 
hope, will overtake them before they get to Red-stone, 
where their canoes lie. As Mr. Gist has been an eyewitness of our proceedings, and is waiting for this without my knowing till just now that he intends to visit you, 
I refer you to him for particulars. I expect my messenger in to-night from the Half-King, and shall write 
more fully to-morrow by the express that came from 
Colonel Fry. 
</p><p>
The numbers of the French have been greatly magnified, as your Honor may see by a copy of the enclosed 
journal of a person, whom I sent out to gain intelligence. 
I have received letters from the Governors of Pennsylvania and Maryland, copies of which I also enclose. 
I am, &,c.

TO COLONEL JOSHUA FRY. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 29 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
This is by an immediate express, whom I send to 
inform you, that yesterday I engaged a party of French, 
whereof ten were killed, one wounded, and twenty-one 
taken, with the loss of only one of mine killed and two or 
three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant Waggener. 
By some of their papers we can discover, that large 
detachments are expected every day, which we may 
reasonably suppose are to attack us, especially since we 
have begun. 
</p><p>
This is therefore to acquaint you with the necessity 
of a reinforcement, which I hope you will detach immediately, as you can be in no manner of danger in your 
march ; for the French must pass our camp, which I 
flatter myself is not practicable without my having intelligence of it, especially as there will be Indians always 
scouting. If a sufficient reinforcement does not come, 
we must either quit our ground and retreat to you, or fight very unequal numbers, which I will do, before I 
will give up one inch of what we have gained. The 
great haste I am in, to despatch the bearer, prevents me 
from being particular at this time. I shall conclude, Sir, 
with assuring you how sincerely concerned I am for 
your indisposition, which I hope you will soon recover 
from, and be able to join us, with the artillery, that we 
may attack the French in their forts. I am, &,c.

<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
Camp at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 29 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In answering your letter by Mr. Birney, I shall begin 
with assuring you, that nothing was farther from my 
intentions than to recede, though I then pressed, and still desire, that my services may be voluntary, rather 
than on the present pay. I am much concerned, that 
you should seem to charge me with ingratitude for your 
generous, though undeserved favors ; for I assure you, 
Sir, nothing is more a stranger to my breast, or a sin 
that my soul more abhors, than that black and detestable one of ingratitude. I retain a true sense of your 
kindness, and want nothing but opportunity to give my 
testimony of willingness to oblige you, as far as my life 
or fortune will extend. 
</p><p>
I could not object to the pay before I knew it. I 
dare say you remember, that the amount allowed by the 
first estimate to a lieutenant-colonel was fifteen shillings, 
and to a major twelve shillings and sixpence, of which I 
then complained very much, till your Honor assured me 
that we were to be furnished with proper necessaries, 
and offered that as a reason why the pay was less than 
that of British officers. After this, when you were so 
kind as to prefer me to the command I now hold, and 
at the same time informed me, that I was to have but 
twelve shillings and sixpence, after this, influenced also by 
some other reasons, I was induced to acquaint Colonel 
Fairfax with my intention of resigning, which he must 
well remember, as it happened at Bellhaven ; and it was 
there that he dissuaded me from it, and promised to 
represent the trifling pay to you, who would endeavour 
(as I at the same time told him that the Speaker thought 
the officers' pay too small) to have it enlarged. 
</p><p>
As to the numbers that applied for commissions, and 
to whom we were preferred, I believe, had those gentlemen been as TV ell acquainted with this country, and 
as sensible of the difficulties that would attend a campaign here as I then was, that your Honor would not 
have been so troublesomely solicited as you were. Yet 
I do not offer this as a reason for quitting the service. 
</p><p>
For my own part I can answer, that I have a constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most 
severe trials, and, I flatter myself, resolution to face 
what any man dares, as shall be proved when it comes 
to the test, which I believe we are upon the borders of. 
</p><p>
There is nothing, Sir, I believe, more certain, than 
that the officers in the Canada expedition had British 
pay allowed, while they were in the service. Lieutenant Waggener, Captain Trent, and several others, 
whom I have conversed with on that head, and who 
were engaged in that expedition, affirm it for truth. 
Therefore, Sir, as this cannot be allowed, suffer me to 
serve as a volunteer, which, I assure you, will be the 
next reward to British pay; for, as my services, so far as 
I have knowledge, shall equal those of the best officer, 
I make it a point of honor not to serve for less, or accept 
a medium. 
</p><p>
Nevertheless, I have communicated your sentiments 
to the other officers, and, as far as I could put on the 
hypocrite, set forth the advantages that may accrue, and 
advised them to accept the terms, as a refusal might 
reflect dishonor upon their character, leaving it to the 
world to assign what reason it pleases for their quitting 
the service. I am very sensible of the pernicious consequences that will attend their resigning, as they have 
gained some experience of the military art, have a 
tolerable knowledge of the country, having been most 
of them sent out at different times with parties, and are 
now accustomed to the hardships and fatigues of living 
as we do, which, I think, were it truly stated, would 
prevent your Honor from many troublesome solicitations 
from others for commissions. This last motive has 
induced and will induce me to do what I can to reconcile matters, though I really believe there are some, who 
will not remain long without an alteration. They have 
promised to consider it, and give you an answer. I 
was not ignorant of the allowance, which Colonel Fry 
has for his table ; but, being a dependent there myself, I 
am deprived of the pleasure of inviting an officer, or 
friend, which to me would be more agreeable, than any 
benefits I shall meet with there. 
</p><p>
And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more 
in your letter on this head, which, too, is more fully 
expressed in a paragraph of Colonel Fairfax's letter to 
me, as follows; "If, on the British establishment, 
officers are allowed more pay, the regimentals they are 
obliged annually to furnish, and their necessary table 
and other incidental expenses, being considered, little 
or no savings will be their portion." 
</p><p>
I believe it is well known, that we have been at the 
expense of regimentals, and it is still better known, that 
regimentals, and every other necessary, which we were 
under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this 
expedition, were not to be bought for less in Virginia currency, than they would cost British officers in sterling 
money ; which ought to have been the case, to put us 
upon a parity in this respect. Then Colonel Fairfax 
observes, that their table and other incidental charges 
prevent them from saving much. They have the enjoyment of their pay, which we neither have in one sense 
nor the other. We are debarred the pleasure of good 
living ; and, Sir, I dare say you will acknowledge, that, 
with one who has always been used to it, it must go 
somewhat hard to be confined to a little salt provision 
and water, and to do duty, hard, laborious duty, which is 
almost inconsistent with that of a soldier, and yet have 
the same reductions as if he were allowed luxuriously. 
My pay, according to the British establishment and 
common exchange, Avould be near twenty shillings per 
day ; in the room of which, the Committee (for I cannot 
in the least imagine your Honor had any hand in it) has 
provided twelve shillings and sixpence, so long as the 
service continues, whereas one half of the other is confirmed to British officers for life. Now if we should 
be fortunate enough to drive the French from the Ohio, 
as far as your Honor would please to have them sent, in 
any short time, our pay will not be sufficient to discharge 
our first expenses. 
</p><p>
I would not have you imagine from this, that I have 
said all these things to have the pay increased, but to 
justify myself, and show you that our complaints are not 
frivolous, but founded upon strict reason. For my own 
part, it is a matter almost indifferent whether I serve for 
full pay, or as a generous volunteer; indeed, did my 
circumstances correspond with my inclinations, I should 
not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter ; for the 
motives that have led me here are pure and noble ; I 
had no view of acquisition, but that of honor, by serving 
faithfully my king and country. 
</p><p>
As you have t recommended Mr. Willis, you may 
depend I shall with pleasure do all I can for him. 
But above all, Sir, you may rely, that I shall take 
all possible means of procuring intelligence, and guarding against surprises; and be assured nothing but 
very unequal numbers shall compel me to submit or retreat. 
</p><p>
Now, Sir, as I have answered your letter, I shall beg 
leave to acquaint you with what has happened since I 
wrote by Mr. Gist. I then informed you, that I had 
detached a party of seventy-five men to meet fifty of 
the French, who, we had intelligence, were upon their 
march towards us. About nine o'clock the same night 
I received an express from the Half-King, who w? 
encamped with several of his people about six miles off, 
that he had seen the tracks of two Frenchmen crossing 
the road, and that, behind, the whole body were lying 
not far off, as he had an account of that number passing 
Mr. Gist's. 
</p><p>
I set out with forty men before ten, and it was from 
that time till near sunrise before we reached the Indians' 
camp, having marched in small paths, through a heavy 
rain, and a night as dark as it is possible to conceive. 
We were frequently tumbling one over another, and 
often so lost, that fifteen or twenty minutes' search 
would not find the path again. 
</p><p>
When we came to the Half- King, I counselled with 
him, and got his assent to go hand-in-hand and strike 
the French. Accordingly, he, Monacawacha, and a few 
other Indians set out with us ; and when we came to the 
place where the tracks were, the Half-King sent two 
Indians to follow their tracks, and discover their lodgement, which they did at half a mile from the road, in a 
very obscure place surrounded with rocks. I thereupon, 
in conjunction with the Half-King and Monacawacha, 
formed a disposition to attack them on all sides, which 
we accordingly did, and, after an engagement of about 
fifteen minutes, we killed ten, wounded one, and took 
twenty -one prisoners. Amongst those killed was M. de 
Jumonville, the commander. The principal officers taken are M. Drouillon and M. La Force, of whom your 
Honor has often heard me speak, as a bold enterprising 
man, and a person of great subtlety and cunning. With 
these are two cadets. 
</p><p>
These officers pretend they were coming on an embassy; but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring, as 
you will see by the Instructions and Summons enclosed. 
Their instructions were to reconnoitre ^the country, 
roads, creeks, and the like, as far as the Potomac, which 
they were about to do. These enterprising men weie 
purposely chosen out to procure intelligence, which they 
were to send back by some brisk despatches, with the 
mention of the day that they were to serve the summons ; which could be with no other view, than to get 
a sufficient reinforcement to fall upon us immediately 
after. This, with several other reasons, induced all the 
officers to believe firmly, that they were sent as spies, 
rather than any thing else, and has occasioned my 
detaining them as prisoners, though they expected, or 
at least had some faint hope, that they should be continued as ambassadors. 
</p><p>
They, finding where we were encamped, instead of 
coming up in a public manner, sought out one of the 
most secret retirements, fitter for a deserter than an 
ambassador to encamp in, and stayed there two or three 
days, sending spies to reconnoitre our camp, as we are 
told, though they deny it. Their whole body moved 
back near two miles, and they sent off two runners to 
acquaint Contrecoeur with our strength, and where we 
were encamped. Now thirty-six men would almost 
have been a retinue for a princely ambassador, instead 
of a petit. Why did they, if their designs were open, 
stay so long within five miles of us, without delivering 
their message, or acquainting me with it ? Their waiting could be with no other design, than to get detachments to enforce the summons, as soon as it was given. 
They had no occasion to send out spies, for the name 
of an ambassador is sacred among all nations; but it 
was by the track of those spies, that they were discovered, and that we got intelligence of them. They 
would not have retired two miles back without delivering the summons, and sought a skulking-place (which, 
to do them justice, was done with great judgment), but 
for some special reason. Besides, the summons is so 
insolent, and savors so much of gasconade, that if two 
men only had come to deliver it openly, it would have 
been too great an indulgence to send them back.
</p><p>
The sense of the Half-King on this subject is, that 
they have bad hearts, and that this is a mere pretence ; 
that they never designed to come to us but in a hostile 
manner, and if we were so foolish as to let them go 
again, he never would assist us in taking another of 
them. Besides, La Force would, if released, I really 
think, do more to our disservice, than fifty other men, 
as he is a person whose active spirit leads him into all 
parties, and has brought him acquainted with all parts 
of the country. Add to this a perfect use of the Indian 
tongue, and great influence with the Indians. He ingenuously enough confessed, that, as soon as he saw 
the commission and instructions, he believed, and then 
said he expected some such tendency, though he pretends to say he does not believe the commander had 
any other than a good design. 
</p><p>
In this engagement we had only one man killed and two or three wounded, among whom was Lieutenant 
Waggener slightly, a most miraculous escape, as our right wing was much exposed to their fire and received it alLf 
</p><p>
The Half-King received your Honor's speech very 
kindly, but desired me to inform you, that he could not 
leave his people at this time, thinking them in great 
danger. He is now gone to the Crossing for their families, to bring them to our camp ; and he desired I would 
furnish some men and horses to assist them up, which I 
have accordingly done. I have sent thirty men and upwards of twenty horses. He says, if your Honor has 
any thing to say, you may communicate it by me, and 
that, if you have a present for them, it may be kept till 
another occasion, after sending out some things for their 
immediate use. He has declared that he will send these 
Frenchmen's scalps, with a hatchet, to all the nations of 
Indians in union with them, and did that very day give a 
hatchet, and a large belt of wampum, to a Delaware man 
to carry to Shingiss. He promised me to send down the 
river for all the Mingoesf and Shawanees to our camp, 
where I expect him to-morrow with thirty or forty men, 
and their wives and children, to" confirm what he has 
said here. He has sent your Honor a string of wampum. 
</p><p>
As these runners went off to the fort on Sunday last, 
I shall expect every hour to be attacked, and by unequal numbers, which I must withstand if there are five 
to one; for I fear the consequence will be, that we shall 
lose the Indians, if we suffer ourselves to be driven 
back. I despatched an express immediately to Colonel 
Fry with this intelligence, desiring him to send me reinforcements with all imaginable speed. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may depend I will not be surprised, let 
them come at what hour they will ; and this is as much 
as I can promise. But my best endeavours shall not 
be wanting to effect more. I doubt not, if you hear 
I am beaten, but you will hear at the same time, that 
we have done our duty, in fighting as long as there was 
a shadow of hope. 
</p><p>
I have sent Lieutenant West, accompanied by Mr. Spiltdorph and a guard of twenty men, to conduct the 
prisoners in, and I believe the officers have told him 
what answer to return to you. 
</p><p>
Monsieur La Force and Major Drouillon beg to be 
recommended to your notice, and I have promised that 
they shall meet with all the favor due to prisoners of 
war. I have shown all the respect I could to them 
here, and have given them some necessary clothing, by 
which I have disfurnished myself; for, having brought no 
more than two or three shirts from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, that 
we might be light, I was ill provided to supply them. 
I am, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have neither seen nor heard any particular account of the Twigtwees since I came on these waters.
We have already begun a palisadoed fort, and hope to have it up to-morrow. I must beg leave to acquaint 
you, that Captain Vanbraam and Ensign Peyrouny have behaved extremely well since they came out, and I 
hope they will meet with your favor, t

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
Without date. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since writing my last I have still stronger presumption, indeed almost confirmation, that they were sent as 
spies, and were ordered to wait near us, till they were 
truly informed of our intentions, situation, and strength, 
and were to have acquainted their commander therewith, and to have lain lurking here for reinforcements 
before they served the summons, if served at all. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but they will endeavour to amuse you with many smooth stories, as they did me ; but they 
were confuted in them all, and, by circumstances too 
plain to be denied, almost made ashamed of their assertions. I dare say you will treat them with respect, 
which is due to all unfortunate persons in their condition. 
But I hope you will give no ear to what they will have 
an opportunity for displaying to the best advantage, 
having none present to contradict their reports. 
</p><p>
I have heard, since they went away, that they should 
say they called to us not to fire; but that I know to be 
false, for I was the first man that approached them, and 
the first whom they saw, and immediately upon it they 
ran to their arms, and fired briskly till they were 
defeated. 
</p><p>
We have heard of another being killed by the Indians, 
that made his escape from us ; so that we are certain of 
thirty-three killed and taken. I thought it expedient 
to acquaint your Honor with the above, as I fancy they 
will have the assurance of asking the privileges due to 
an embassy, when in strict justice they ought to be 
hanged as spies of the worst sort, being authorized by 
their commander, at the expense of a character, which 
should be sacred to all nations, and never trifled with or 
used in an equivocal way. t I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 10 June, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
Yours I received by the post, and return you my 
hearty thanks for your kind congratulation on our late 
success, which I hope to improve without risking the 
imputation of rashness, or hazarding what a prudent 
conduct would forbid. I rejoice that I am likely to be 
happy under the command of an experienced officer, 
and man of sense. It is what I have ardently wished for.  I shall here beg leave to return my grateful thanks 
for your favor in promoting me to the command of the 
regiment. Believe me, Sir, when I assure you, that my 
breast is warmed with every generous sentiment, which 
your goodness can inspire. I want nothing but opportunity to testify my sincere regard for your person, to 
whom I stand indebted for so many unmerited favors. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may depend, I shall myself, and will 
endeavour to make my officers, show Captain Mackay 
all the respect due to his rank and merit ; but I should 
have been particularly obliged, if you had declared 
whether he was under my command, or independent of 
it.f However, I shall be studious to avoid all disputes 
that may tend to the public prejudice, but, as far as I 
am able, will inculcate harmony and unanimity. I hope 
Captain Mackay will have more sense, than to insist 
upon any unreasonable distinction because he and his 
officers have commissions from his Majesty. Let him 
consider, though we are greatly inferior in respect to 
advantages of profit, yet we have the same spirit to 
serve our gracious King as they have, and are as ready and willing to sacrifice our lives for our country's good. 
And here, once more, and for the last time, I must say, 
'that it will be a circumstance, which will act upon some 
officers of this regiment beyond all measure, to be 
obliged to serve upon such different terms, when their 
lives, their fortunes, and their operations are equally, and, 
I dare say, as effectually exposed, as those of others, 
who are happy enough to have King's commissions. 
</p><p>
I have been solicitous on this head, and have earnestly 
endeavoured to reconcile the officers to their appointments, and flatter myself that I have succeeded, having 
heard no mention thereof lately. I considered the pernicious consequences, that would attend a disunion, and 
was therefore too much attached to my country's interests to suffer it to ripen, after I received your letters. 
</p><p>
I am very thankful to you for ordering an assortment of Indian goods, which we daily find still more 
necessary. I shall take care, while they are under my 
direction, that they are judiciously applied, and shall 
be particularly careful in consulting Mr. Croghan and 
Mr. Montour, by whom I shall be advised in all Indian 
affairs agreeably to your directions.
</p><p>
I shall with great pleasure wear the medal, which you 
were pleased to compliment me with, and shall present 
the others to Indian chiefs, as I have already done one 
to the Half-King. 
</p><p>
We have been extremely ill used by Major Carlyle's 
deputies, which I am heartily sorry for, since he is a 
gentleman so capable of the business himself, and has 
taken so much pains to give satisfaction. He, I believe, 
has been deceived, and we have suffered by those under him, and by those who have contracted for provisions. We have been six days without flour, and 
there is none upon the road for our relief that we know 
of, though I have by repeated expresses given him timely 
notice. We have not provisions of any sort enough in 
camp to serve us two days. Once before we should 
have been four days without provisions, if Providence 
had not sent a trader from the Ohio to our relief, for 
whose flour I was obliged to give twenty-one shillings

In a late letter to Major Carlyle, I have complained 
of the tardiness of his deputies. I likewise desired, that 
suitable stores of ammunition might be sent up speedily, 
for till that is done we have it not in our power to 
attempt any advantageous enterprise ; but must wait its 
arrival at Red-stone, for which I shall set off the moment 
provisions arrive to sustain us on the march. Major 
Carlyle mentioned a contract he had made with Mr. 
Croghan for flour, likewise Mr. Croghan's offer of furnishing more if required. I have therefore desired to 
have all that Mr. Croghan can furnish. 
</p><p>
Major Muse, with Captain Montour, joined us yesterday, and brought the wampum you sent to the HalfKing, which I presented, with the medal and speech. 
He is very thankful for the notice you have taken of 
him. Major Muse brought nine of the swivels, with 
some powder and balls ; and this day I have engaged 
fifty or sixty horses to bring up more of the balls and 
other stores from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, if there should be no 
provisions to load them with. The balls are to be 
brought in leather bags made for the purpose. I hear 
that Captain Mackay, who was to have brought the 
artillery, has marched without it, as wagons could not 
be procured. I shall write to Mr. Gist to procure wagons, if he is obliged to go to Pennsylvania for them, to 
bring out the artillery, if not, when Colonel Innes comes 
up we shall have nothing in readiness, and shall let slip 
this best season for action. 
</p><p>
The Indians are drawing off from the River daily, one 
of whom last night brought news of Monacawacha. He 
went from Logstown about five nights ago with the 
French scalps, and four hatchets, with which he intended 
to visit the four tribes of Indians between this and Lake 
Erie, and present to each tribe a scalp and hatchet, and 
at the same time acquaint them that it was expected, 
as the English and Six Nations had hand-in-hand 
struck the French, they would join our forces. This 
messenger likewise says, that Monacawacha was determined not only to counsel with the chiefs of those tribes, 
but with their great warriors also, which is customary in 
these cases, and was to return as soon as possible, 
which he imagined would be in fifteen days; but in 
case he should not return in that time, he left orders 
for the Indians at Logstown to set off for Red-stone 
Creek, so that they would all meet at Red-stone to join 
their brothers the English. He also desired there might 
be no attack made against the French fort, till he should 
return, by which time he hoped all the forces would be 
gathered, and then they would make a general attack 
together, and gain a complete victory at once. 
</p><p>
The Half-King has sent messengers to other places 
for warriors, who are to meet us also at Red-stone 
Creek. Besides these, he has sent two messengers, 
by the advice of Mr. Croghan, Mr. Montour, and myself, 
one to invite the Shawanees to come and receive one 
of their men, who was imprisoned in Carolina, and to 
counsel with us, and the other to the Delawares for the 
same purpose, as we hear both these nations have 
accepted the hatchet against us. This report was first 
brought by an Indian sent from Logstown to the HalfKing, and since confirmed by nine French deserters, 
who arrived at our camp to-day. These men farther 
say, that the fort at the Fork is completed, and proof 
against any attempts, but with bombs, on the land side. 
There were not above five hundred men in it, when 
they left it, but they suppose by this time two hundred 
more are arrived. Nine hundred were ordered to follow them, who might be expected in fourteen or fifteen 
days. 
</p><p>
I was as much disappointed when I met these persons 
to-day, as ever I was in my life. By misunderstanding 
the scouts that brought me intelligence, that is, mistaking ninety for nine, I marched out at the head of one 
hundred and thirty men (the major part of the effective 
men in the regiment), full with the hope of procuring 
another present of French prisoners for your Honor. 
Judge then my disappointment at meeting nine only, 
and those coming for protection. I guarded against all 
casualties, that might happen to the camp, and ordered 
Major Muse to repair into the fort, and erect the small 
swivels for the defence of the place, which he could do 
in an hour's time. 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your desire I shall here mention the 
names of the gentlemen, who are to be promoted. 
Lieutenant George Mercer will worthily succeed to a 
captaincy. Captain Vanbraam has acted as captain 
ever since we left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>. He is an experienced, 
good officer, and very worthy of the command he has 
enjoyed. Mr. James Towers is the oldest ensign, for 
whom you will please to send a lieutenancy. To Captain Stephen I have already given a major's commission, 
finding one blank among Colonel Fry's papers. If 
merit, Sir, will entitle a gentleman to your notice, 
Mr. Peyrouny may justly claim a share of your favor. 
His conduct has been governed by the most consummate prudence, and all his actions have sufficiently 
testified his readiness to serve his country, which I 
really believe he looks upon Virginia to be. He was 
sensibly chagrined, when I acquainted him with your 
pleasure, of giving him an ensigncy. This he had twelve 
years ago, and long since commanded a company. 
He was prevailed on by Colonel Fry, when he left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, to accept the former commission, and assist 
my detachment, as I had very few officers, till we all 
met on the Ohio, which commission he would now have 
resigned, and returned to Virginia, but for my great 
dissuasion to the contrary. I have promised to solicit 
your Honor to appoint him adjutant, and continue him 
ensign, which will induce a very good officer to remain 
in the regiment. The office of adjutant, Sir, is most 
necessary to a regiment, in distributing the daily orders, 
receiving all reports, and seeing orders executed. In 
short, an adjutant is an indispensable officer. Should 
you be pleased to indulge me in this request, I shall 
look upon it in a very particular light, as I think the 
personal merit of the gentleman, his knowledge of military duty, and his activity will render him highly worthy 
of the favor. An ensign is still wanting, whom I hope 
you will send, if you know of any one suitable for the 
office. A young man in the camp, who came with 
Captain Lewis, has solicited, but I am yet ignorant of 
his character and qualities. He is a volunteer, and 
recommended by Captain Lewis. 
</p><p>
In a letter by Mr. Ward, you acquainted me, that 
you had given orders to Colonel Fry to examine into 
the proceedings of Captain Trent, and his lieutenant, 
Frazier, by a court-martial. I shall be glad if you will 
repeat your orders and instructions to me, or rather 
to Colonel Innes ; for an officer cannot be tried by those 
of his own regiment only, but has a right to be heard in a general court-martial. Captain Trent's behaviour 
has been very tardy, and has convinced the world of 
what they before suspected, his great timidity. Lieutenant Frazier, though not altogether blameless, is much 
more excusable, for he would not accept of the commission, till he had a promise from his captain, that he 
should not reside at the fort, nor visit it above once a week, or as he saw necessary. 
</p><p>
Queen Aliquippa desired that her son, who is really 
a great warrior, might be taken into council, as he was 
declining and unfit for business, and that he should 
have an English name given him. I therefore called 
the Indians together by the advice of the Half-King, 
presented one of the medals, and desired him to wear 
it in remembrance of his great father, the King of England, and called him by the name of Colonel Fairfax, 
which he was told signified the first of the council. This 
gave him great pleasure. I was also informed, that an 
English name would please the Half-King, which made 
me presume to give him that of your Honor, and call him 
Dinwiddie ; interpreted in their language, the head of 
all. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. These deserters corroborate what the others 
said and we suspected. La Force's party were sent out as spies, and were to show that summons if discovered, or overpowered, by a superior party of ours. 
They say the commander was blamed for sending so small a party. 
</p><p>
Since writing the foregoing, Captain Mackay, with 
the Independent Company, has arrived, whom I take 
to be a very good sort of a gentleman. For want of 
proper instructions from your Honor, I am much at a 
loss to know how to act, or proceed in regard to his 
company. I made it my particular study to receive 
him (as it was your desire) with all the respect and 
politeness, that were due to his rank, or that I was 
capable of showing ; and I do not doubt from his appearance and behaviour, that a strict intimacy will ensue, 
when matters shall be put in a clear light. But at present, 
I assure you, they will rather impede the service, than 
forward it ; for, as they have commissions from the King, 
they look upon themselves as a distinct body, and will 
not incorporate and do duty with our men, but keep 
separate guards, and encamp separately. I have not 
offered to control Captain Mackay in any thing, nor 
showed that I claimed a superior command, except in 
giving the patrole and countersign, which must be the 
same in an army consisting of different nations, to distinguish friends from foes. He knows the necessity of 
this, yet does not think he is to receive it from me. 
Then who is to give it '] Am I to issue these orders to 
a company 1 Or is an independent captain to prescribe 
rules to the Virginia regiment ? This is the question. 
But its absurdity is obvious. 
</p><p>
It now behoves you, Sir, to lay your absolute commands on one or the other to obey. This is indispensably necessary, for nothing clashes more with reason, 
than to conceive our small bodies can act distinctly, 
without having connexion with one another, and yet be 
serviceable to the public. I do not doubt that Captain 
Mackay is an officer of sense, and I dare say will do the 
best for the service ; but, Sir, two commanders are so 
incompatible, that we cannot be as useful to one another, 
or the public, as we ought ; and I am sincerely sorry, 
that he has arrived before your instructions by Colonel 
Innes, who I doubt not will be fully authorized how to 
act. But as we have no news of Colonel Innes, I have, 
in the mean time, desired Major Carlyle to send this by 
an immediate express to you, who, I hope, will satisfy 
these doubts. 
</p><p>
Captain Mackay and I have lived in the most perfect 
harmony since his arrival, and have reasoned on this 
calmly ; and, I believe, if we should have occasion to 
exert our whole force, we shall do as well as divided 
authority can do. We have not had the least warmth 
of dispute. He thinks you have not a power to give 
commissions, that will command him. If so, I can very 
confidently say, that his absence would tend to the public advantage. I have been particularly careful in discovering no foolish desire of commanding him, neither 
have I intermeddled with his company in the least, nor 
given any directions concerning it, except, in general, 
the countersign, and place to repair to in case of an 
alarm, none of which he thinks he should receiveo I 
have testified to him, in the most serious manner, the 
pleasure I should take in consulting and advising with 
him upon all occasions, and I am satisfied that we shall 
never differ after you have decided this point. I am 
convinced, that your own just discernment and consideration will prove to you, that there can be no medium. 
The nature of the thing will not allow of it. Before orders will be observed, it must be known who is to 
command ; and I am very confident you will see the 
absurdity, and consider the effects, of Captain Mackay's 
having the direction of the regiment ; for it would certainly be the hardest thing in life, if we are to do double 
and treble duty, and neither be entitled to the pay nor 
rank of soldiers. That the first column of the Virginia 
regiment has done more for the interest of this expedition, than any company, or corps, that will hereafter 
arrive, must be obvious to all. This, Sir, Captain Mackay 
did not hesitate one moment to allow, since he has seen 
the work we have done upon the roads. We shall part 
to-morrow. I shall continue my march to Red-stone, 
while his company remains here. This, Sir, I found 
absolutely necessary for the public interest. Captain 
Mackay says, that it is not in his power to oblige his 
men to work on the road, unless he will engage them a 
shilling sterling a day, which I would not choose to do. 
And to suffer them to march at their ease, whilst our 
faithful soldiers are laboriously employed, carries with it 
an air of such distinction, that it is not to be wondered 
at, if the poor fellows were to declare the hardship of it. 
He also assures me, that this is not peculiar to his company, but that no soldiers subject to martial law can be 
obliged to work for less. I shall continue to complete 
the work we have begun with my own men. We shall 
have the whole credit, as no others have assisted. 
</p><p>
I hope, from what has been said, your Honor will see 
the necessity of giving your speedy order on this head ; 
and I am sensible you will consider the evil tendency, 
that will accompany Captain Mackay's arrival. The 
rank of office to me, Sir, is much more important than the pay. 
</p><p>
Captain Mackay brought none of the cannon, very little ammunition, about five days' allowance of flour, 
and sixty beeves. I am much grieved to find our stores 
so slowly advancing. God knows when we shall be 
able to do any thing to deserve better of our country.
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with the most sincere and unfeigned regard, 
your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last to you, I have received, by Mr. Spiltdorph, the letter therein alluded to, the contents of 
which are nearly the same as in the one received from the Virginia regiment, and left Captain Mackay with his company to guard 
Fort Necessity. Thus the difficulty ahout command was for the time removed. He advanced slowly as far as Gist's house, thirteen miles from 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, employing the soldiers on the way in repairing the 
road, and sending out scouting parties to watch the motions of the French. 
In the mean time, he held councils with several Indian chiefs, who came to 
him for that purpose, delivered speeches, exchanged belts of wampum, and 
went through the usual ceremonies on such occasions. But all to little 
purpose, for some of the Indians were treacherous spies from the French, 
and others had no higher motive than that of obtaining presents of goods 
and provisions. In this mode of gaining friends, the French were much 
the most successful, as they were better supplied with all the articles 
wanted by the Indians. A party of men was likewise despatched to clear 
the road beyond Gist's house, towards the junction of Red-stone Creek 
with the Monongahela.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 20 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Peyrouny, soliciting for leave to attend the Assembly, with the hope of having some allowance made 
for his loss of clothes and other articles, which he sustained in common with us all, and being not thoroughly 
cured of his wounds, which have hitherto rendered 
him unfit for duty, I thought it proper to indulge him in 
this request. By him I again take the liberty of reminding your Honor of the great necessity there is of a 
regulation in the soldiers' pay, and that a deduction be 
made for the country to furnish them with clothes; 
otherwise they never will be fit for service ; they are 
now naked, and cannot get credit even for a hat, and 
are teazing the officers every day to furnish them with 
these and other necessaries. 
</p><p>
Another thing, which should be fixed indisputably, is 
the law we are to be guided by, whether martial or 
military. If the former, I must beg the favor of your 
Honor to give me some written orders and indemnification ; otherwise I cannot give my assent (as I am liable 
for all proceedings) to any judgment of a court-martial, 
that touches the life of a soldier ; though at this time 
there is an absolute necessity for it, as the soldiers are deserting constantly. Yesterday, while we were at 
church, twenty-five of them collected, and were going 
off in the face of their officers, but were stopped and imprisoned before the plot came to its height. 
</p><p>
Colonel Innes did not fill up any commissions for the 
Virginia regiment, which has given those entitled to 
promotion some uneasiness. His reasons were, that it 
would be an unnecessary expense to the country, till 
there were orders to recruit ; but this, I think, should 
not have been considered, while it is remembered how 
small encouragement is shown them upon every occasion. Another motive, which, I believe, served to prevent it, was his dislike to the form of the commissions, 
as it savoured so much of the militia. He told me he 
would send down another form for your approbation, and 
Colonel Fairfax has also taken another, both of which 
are greatly preferable to those by which we act. And 
here I must beg leave to acquaint you, that the one you 
sent me is not signed. 
</p><p>
The officers are uneasy about their pay, and think it 
hard to be kept out of it so long. They hope you will 
order the dates of their commissions to be from the time 
of the vacancies that happened, of which I have enclosed 
a list for your information, hoping with them, that you 
will be kind enough to fill them up yourself, and return 
such commissions as were sent for precedents. 
</p><p>
Mr. West, lieutenant of Vanbraam's company, has 
resigned his commission, which I herewith send. I also 
enclose a list of medicines, which the doctor desires may 
be procured for the use of the regiment. He solicits 
much for an assistant, and I believe it necessary, as he 
often has more business than he can well manage, and, 
were a large detachment sent upon duty, it would be 
imprudent to go without the surgeon. 
</p><p>
If you should think proper to promote Mr. Peyrouny, we shall be at a loss for a good disciplinarian to do adjutant's duty, which requires a perfect knowledge of all 
the kinds of duty. I should, therefore, take it extremely 
kind, if you would be pleased to confer the office upon 
Mr. Frazier, whom I think I can fully answer for, let his 
former conduct have been what it may. 
</p><p>
We have caught two deserters, whom I shall keep 
imprisoned till I receive your answer how far the martial 
law may be extended. It is necessary that an example 
be made of some, as a warning to others; for there is 
scarcely a night, or an opportunity, when there are not 
desertions, and often two, three, or four at a time. We 
always advertise and pursue them as quickly as possible, 
but seldom to any purpose. The expenses attending 
this will fall heavily upon the country while this spirit 
prevails. I am, &,c.

SIR,

As I wrote so lately and fully to you, by Mr. Poison, 
on the subject of the orders I had received, I have little 
to add now, only to acquaint your Honor, that as far as 
it is in my power, I shall endeavour to comply with 
them. What men we can, we do enlist ; but to send 
officers into different parts for that purpose, would be 
unavailing, as they neither have money, nor can get any. 
I have given Major Carlyle memorandums of several 
questions to ask your Honor, to which I beg your answers, that I may be governed thereby. I have also sent 
some of the soldiers' accounts, in hope of getting the 
money for them, as they are uneasy on that head. 
Others of them are rendered useless by their late wounds ; therefore I hope you will recommend it to the 
consideration of the Assembly, that some provision may 
be made to keep them from want. 
</p><p>
I have also desired Major Carlyle to mention to you 
the great necessity there is for regulation in the soldiers' 
pay ; and that a certain part may be deducted and appropriated for clothing. Unless this be done, we shall 
ever be in the distressed condition we are in at present, 
concerning which Major Carlyle can fully inform you. 
I refer you to him for many particulars, especially the 
consequences of going as high as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, if we 
cannot march farther ; as, for the reasons which have

</p><p>
15 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter from Rousby Hall, of 
the 4th instant. It demands my best acknowledgments 
for the particular marks of esteem you have expressed 
therein, and for the kind assurances of his Excellency 
Governor Sharpe's good wishes towards me. I also 
thank you, and sincerely, Sir, for your friendly intention 
of making my situation easy, if I return to the service ; 
and I do not doubt, could I submit to the terms, that opinion, that the progress of the French will never be effectually opposed, 
but by means of an act of Parliament to compel the colonies to contribute 
to the common cause independently of Assemblies, who in these parts are 
either ignorant, or do not foresee danger at a distance, or at least are so obstinate as to pay little regard to it." And, again, to the Secretary of State ; 
" I know of no method to compel them to their duty to the King, but by an 
act of Parliament for a general poll-tax of two shillings and sixpence a 
head from all the colonies on this continent." Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. 
</p><p>
Had this counsel of Governor Dinwiddie been followed, it would probably have hastened the Revolution a few years, which, as it was, happened 
only twenty years afterwards. From the tenor of this correspondence, we 
may also learn what kind of intelligence and advice the government in 
England was in the habit of receiving from its governors, and may account in some degree for the extraordinary delusion, that finally prevailed, 
respecting the character, temper, and feelings of the colonists. 
</p><p>
I should be as happy under your command in the absence of the General, as under any gentleman's whatever. 
But I think the disparity between the present offer of a 
company and my former rank too great, to expect any 
real satisfaction or enjoyment in a corps, where I once 
had, or thought I had, a right to command ; even if his 
Excellency had power to suspend the orders received 
in the Secretary of War's letter ; which, by the by, I 
am very far from thinking he has, or that he will attempt 
to do it, without fuller instructions than I believe he has 
received ; especially, too, as there has been a representation of this matter by Governor Dinwiddie, and, I 
believe, the Assembly of this province. 
</p><p>
All that I presume the General can do, is, to prevent 
the different corps from interfering, which will occasion 
the duty to be done by corps, instead of detachments ; 
a very inconvenient way, as found by experience.
</p><p>
You make mention in your letter of my continuing in the service, and retaining my colonel's commission. 
This idea has filled me with surprise ; for, if you think 
me capable of holding a commission, that has neither 
rank nor emolument annexed to it, you must entertain a very contemptible opinion of my weakness, 
and believe me to be more empty than the commission 
itself. 
</p><p>
Besides, Sir, if I had time, I could enumerate many 
good reasons, that forbid all thoughts of my returning ; 
and which to you, or any other person, would, upon the 
strictest scrutiny, appear to be well founded. I must 
be reduced to a very low command, and subjected to 
that of many, who have acted as my inferior officers. 
In short, every captain, bearing the King's commission, 
every half-pay officer, or others appearing with such a 
commission, would rank before me. For these reasons 
I choose to submit to the loss of health, which I have, 
however, already sustained, (not to mention that of 
effects,) and the fatigue I have undergone in our first 
efforts, rather than subject myself to the same inconveniences, and run the risk of a second disappointment, 
</p><p>
I shall have the consolation of knowing, that I have 
opened the way, when the smallness of our numbers 
exposed us to the attacks of a superior enemy ; that I 
have hitherto stood the heat and brunt of the day, and 
escaped untouched in time of extreme danger ; and that 
I have the thanks of my country, for the services I have 
rendered it.
</p><p>
The information I have received shall not sleep in 
silence, that those peremptory orders from home, which 
you say could not be dispensed with, for reducing the 
regiment into Independent Companies, were generated 
and hatched at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>. Ingenuous treatment and plain dealing I at least expected. It is to be hoped 
the project will answer ; it shall meet with my acquiescence in every thing except personal services. I herewith enclose Governor Sharpe's letter, which I beg you 
will return to him, with my acknowledgments for the 
favor he intended me. Assure him, Sir, as you truly 
may, of my reluctance to quit the service, and of the 
pleasure I should have received in attending his fortunes. 
Inform him, also, that it was to obey the call of honor, 
and the advice of my friends, that I declined it, and not 
to gratify any desire I had to leave the military line. 
My inclinations are strongly bent to arms. 
</p><p>
The length of this letter, and the small room I have 
left, tell me how necessary it is to conclude; which 
I will do, with the assurance that you shall always 
find me 
</p><p>
Truly and sincerely your most humble servant.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The arrival of a good deal of company (among whom 
is my mother, alarmed at the report of my intention to attend your fortunes,) deprives me of the pleasure of 
waiting upon you to-day, as I had designed. I therefore 
beg, that you will be kind enough to make my compliments and excuse to the General, who I hope to hear 
is greatly recovered from his indisposition, and recruited 
sufficiently to prosecute his journey to Annapolis, t 
</p><p>
I find myself much embarrassed with my affairs, having no person in whom I can confide, to entrust the 
management of them with. Notwithstanding, I am determined to do myself the honor of accompanying you, 
upon this proviso, that the General will be kind enough 
to permit my return, as soon as the active part of the 
campaign is at an end, if it is desired ; or, if there should 
be a space of inaction, long enough to admit a visit to 
my home, that I may be indulged in coming to it. 
</p><p>
I need not add, how much I should be obliged by 
joining you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, instead of doing it at an 
earlier period, t 
</p><p>
These things, Sir, in whatever light they may appear to you at first sight, will not, I hope, be thought unreasonable, when it is considered how unprepared I am to 
quit a family, and an estate I was just about to settle, 
which is in the utmost confusion. 
</p><p>
I enclose a letter from Colonel Fairfax to Governor 
Shirley, which, with his compliments, he desired might 
be given to that gentleman. He also sends his blessing 
to you. At present he entertains sanguine hopes of you ; 
this for your comfort. 
</p><p>
I herewith send you a small map of the back country, 
which, though imperfect and roughly drawn, for want 
of proper instruments, may give you a better knowledge of the designated parts, than you have hitherto 
had an opportunity of acquiring. 
</p><p>
I shall do myself the honor of waiting upon the General, as soon as I hear of his return from Annapolis. 
My compliments attend him, and Mr. Shirley. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I little expected, when I wrote you last, that I should 
so soon engage in another campaign ; but, in doing it, I 
may be allowed to claim some merit, if it is considered 
that the sole motive, which invites me to the field, is the 
laudable desire of serving my country, not the gratification of any ambitious or lucrative plans. This, I flatter 
myself, will manifestly appear by my going as a volunteer, without expectation of reward, or prospect of 
obtaining a command, as I am confidently assured it is not in General Braddock's power to give me a commission that I would accept. Perhaps by many others the 
above declaration might be construed into self-applause, 
which, unwilling to lose, I proclaim myself. But by you, 
Sir, I expect it will be viewed in a different light, because you have sympathized in my disappointments, 
and lent your friendly aid to reinstate me in a suitable command ; the recollection of which can never be 
lost upon a mind, that is not insensible of obligations, 
but always ready to acknowledge them. 
</p><p>
This is the reason why I am so much more unreserved in the expression of my sentiments to you, than 
I should be to the world, whose censures and criticisms 
often place good designs in a bad light. But, to be 
ingenuous, I must confess I have other intentions in 
writing you this letter ; for, if there is any merit in my 
case, I am unwilling to hazard it among my friends, 
without this exposition of facts, as they might conceive 
that some advantageous offers had engaged my services, 
when, in reality, it is otherwise, for I expect to be a 
considerable loser in my private affairs by going. It is 
true I have been importuned to make this campaign by 
General Braddock, as a member of his family, he conceiving, I suppose, that the small knowledge I have had 
an opportunity of acquiring of the country, Indians, &c., 
is worthy of his notice, and may be useful to him in the 
progress of the expedition. 
</p><p>
I heartily wish a happy issue to all your resolves, and 
am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant

</p><p>
DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I cannot think of quitting Fairfax, without embracing 
this last opportunity of bidding you farewell. I shall 
this day set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>, where I expect to 
meet the General, and to stay, I fear, too long, as the 
march must be regulated by the slow movements of the 
train ; which, I am sorry to say, will be tedious, very 
tedious indeed, as I have long predicted, though few 
believed. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> has been honored with five governors hi consultation ; a favorable presage, I hope, not 
only of the success of this expedition, but of the future 
greatness of that town ; for surely such a meeting must 
have been occasioned by the commodious and pleasant 
situation of the place, which prognosticates population, 
and increase of a flourishing trade. 
</p><p>
I have had the honor to be introduced to several governors, and of being well received by them ; especially 
Mr. Shirley, whose character and appearance have perfectly charmed me. I think his every word and action 
discover in him the gentleman and politician. I heartily 
wish the same unanimity may prevail among us, as 
appeared to exist between him and his Assembly, 
when they, to expedite the business, and to forward his 
journey hither, sat till eleven and twelve o'clock every 
night. 
</p><p>
It will be needless, as I know your punctuality requires no stimulus, to remind you of an affair, about 
which I wrote some time ago ; therefore I shall only beg 
my compliments to Mr. Nicholas and his lady, and to 
all friends who think me worthy of their inquiries. I 
am, &,c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I overtook the General at Frederic Town, in Maryland. Thence we proceeded to this place, where we 
shall remain till the arrival of the second division of the 
train, which we hear left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> on Tuesday last. 
After that, we shall continue our march to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>; 
from whence, it is imagined, we shall not stir till the 
latter end of this month, for want of wagons and other 
conveniences of transport over the mountains. 
</p><p>
You will naturally conclude, that to pass through 
Maryland, when no object required it, was an uncommon, and an extraordinary route for the General and for 
Colonel Dunbar's regiment to .this place. The reason, 
however, was obvious. Those who promoted it had 
rather the communication should be opened that way, 
than through Virginia; but I believe the eyes of the 
General are now opened, and the imposition detected ; 
consequently, the like will not happen again. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
As wearing boots is quite the mode, and mbe are in 
a declining state, I must beg the favor of you to procure 
me a pair that are good and neat, and send them to Major Carlyle, who, I hope, will contrive to forward 
them, as quickly as my necessity requires. 
</p><p>
I see no prospect of moving from this place soon, as 
we have neither horses nor wagons enough, and no forage, except what is expected from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; therefore, I am well convinced, that the trouble and difficulty 
we must encounter in passing the mountains, for the 
want of proper conveniences, will equal all the difficulties of the campaign ; for I conceive the march of such 
a train of artillery, in these roads, to be a tremendous 
undertaking. As to any danger from the enemy, I look 
upon it as trifling, for I believe the French will be 
obliged to exert their utmost force to repel the attacks 
to the northward, where Governor Shirley and others, 
with a body of eight thousand men, will annoy their settlements, and attempt their forts. 
</p><p>
The General has appointed me one of his aids-decamp, in which character I shall serve this campaign 
agreeably enough, as I am thereby freed from all commands but his, and give his orders, which must be 
implicitly obeyed. 
</p><p>
I have now a good opportunity, and shall not neglect 
it, of forming an acquaintance, which may be serviceable 
hereafter, if I find it worth while to push my fortune in 
the military line. 
</p><p>
I have written to my two female correspondents by 
this opportunity, one of whose letters I have enclosed 
to you, and beg your deliverance of it. I shall expect 
a particular account of all that has happened since my 
departure.

</p><p>
DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
Immediately upon our leaving the camp at George's Creek, on the 14th instant, from whence I wrote to you, 
I was seized with a violent fever and pain of the head, which continued without intermission until the 23d, 
when I was relieved, by the General's absolutely ordering the physician to give me Dr. James's powders, one 
of the most excellent medicines in the world. It gave me immediate ease, and removed my fever and other 
complaints in four days' time. My illness was too violent to suffer me to ride ; therefore I was indebted to a 
covered wagon for some part of my transportation ; but even in this, I could not continue far. The jolting was 
so great, that I was left upon the road with a guard, and some necessaries, to wait the arrival of Colonel 
Dunbar's detachment, which was two days' march behind us, the General giving me his word of honor, that I 
should be brought up, before he reached the French fort. This promise, and the doctor's declaration, that, if 
I persevered in my attempts to go on, in the condition I then was, my life would be endangered, determined me to halt for the above mentioned detachment. 
</p><p>
As the communication between this and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a> 
must soon be too dangerous for single persons to pass, 
it will render the intercourse of letters slow and precarious ; therefore I shall attempt (and will go through it 
if I have strength) to give you an account of our proceedings, our situation, and prospects at present ; which I 
desire you will communicate to Colonel Fairfax, and 
others, my correspondents, for I am too weak to write 
more than this letter. 
</p><p>
In the letter, which I wrote to you from George's 
Creek, I acquainted you, that, unless the number of 
wagons was retrenched, and the carriage-horses increased, we should never be able to see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
This, in two days afterwards (which was about the time 
they got to the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, with some of their foremost wagons, and strongest teams), they themselves 
were convinced of; for they found, that, besides the 
extreme difficulty of getting the wagons along at all, 
they had often a line of three or four miles in length ; 
and the soldiers guarding them were so dispersed, that, 
if we had been attacked either in front, centre, or rear, 
the part so attacked must have been cut off, or totally 
routed, before they could be sustained by any other 
corps. 
</p><p>
At the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a> a second council was called 
(for there had been one before), wherein the urgency 
for horses was again represented to the officers of the 
different corps, and how laudable a farther retrenchment of their baggage would be, that the spare ones 
might be turned over for the public service. In order 
to encourage this, I gave up my best horse, which I 
have never heard of since, and took no more baggage 
than half my portmanteau would easily contain. It is 
said, however, that the number reduced by this second 
attempt was only from two hundred and ten or twelve, 
to two hundred, which had no perceivable effect. 
</p><p>
The General, before they met in council, asked my 
private opinion concerning the expedition. I urged him, 
in the warmest terms I was able, to push forward, if he 
even did it with a small but chosen band, with such artillery and light stores as were necessary ; leaving the 
heavy artillery, baggage, and the like with the rear division 
of the army, to follow by slow and easy marches, which 
they might do safely, while we were advanced in front. 
As one reason to support this opinion, I urged, that, if 
we could credit our intelligence, the French were weak 
at the Fork at present, but hourly expected reinforcements, which, to my certain knowledge, could not arrive 
with provisions, or any supplies, during the continuance 
of the drought, as the Buffalo River (Riviere aux Boeufs), 
down which was their only communication to Venango, 
must be as dry as we now found the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a> of 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a>, which may be passed dry-shod. 
</p><p>
This advice prevailed, and it was determined, that 
the General, with one thousand two hundred chosen 
men, and officers from all the different corps, under the 
following field officers, viz. ; Sir Peter Halket, who acts 
as brigadier ; Lieutenant- Colonel Gage, LieutenantColonel Burton, and Major Sparks, with such a number of wagons as the train would absolutely require, 
should march as soon as things could be got in readiness. This was completed, and we were on our march, 
by the 19th, leaving Colonel Dunbar and Major Chapman behind, with the residue of the two regiments, some 
Independent Companies, most of the women, and, in 
short, every thing not absolutely essential, carrying our 
provisions and other necessaries upon horses. 
</p><p>
We set out with less than thirty carriages, including 
those that transported the ammunition for the howitzers, 
twelve-pounders, and six-pounders, and all of them 
strongly horsed ; which was a prospect that conveyed 
infinite delight to my mind, though I was excessively ill 
at the time. But this prospect was soon clouded, and 
my hopes brought very low indeed, w r hen I found, that, 
instead of pushing on with vigor, without regarding a 
little rough road, they were halting to level every molehill, and to erect bridges over every brook, by which 
means we were four days in getting twelve miles. 
</p><p>
At this camp I was left by the Doctor's advice, and 
the General's positive orders, as I have already mentioned, without which I should not have been prevailed 
upon to remain behind ; as I then imagined, and now 
believe, I shall find it no easy matter to join my own 
corps again, which is twenty-five miles in advance. 
Notwithstanding, I had the General's word of honor, 
pledged in the most solemn manner, that I should 
be brought up before he arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
They have had frequent alarms, and several men have 
been scalped ; but this is done with no other design, 
than to retard the march, and to harass the men, who, 
if they are to be turned out every time a small party 
attacks the guards at night (for I am certain they have 
not sufficient force to make a serious assault), the enemy's aim will be accomplished by the gaining of time. 
</p><p>
I have been now six days with Colonel Dunbar's 
corps, who are in a miserable condition for want of 
horses, not having enough for their wagons ; so that the 
only method he has of proceeding, is to march with as 
many wagons as these will draw, and then halt till the 
remainder are brought up with the same horses, which 
requires two days more ; and shortly, I believe, he will 
not be able to stir at all. There has been vile management in regard to horses. 
</p><p>
My strength will not admit of my saying more, though 
I have not said half that I intended concerning our 
affairs here. Business I shall not think of, but depend 
solely upon your management of all my affairs, not 
doubting that they will be well conducted. I am, &c. 
</p><p>
July 2d. A serious inconvenience attended me in 
my sickness, and that was losing the use of my servant ; 
for poor John Alton was taken about the same time that 
I was, and with nearly the same disorder, and was confined as long ; so that we did not see each other for 
several days. He is also tolerably well recovered. 
</p><p>
We are advanced almost as far as the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>, 
and I shall set out to-morrow morning for my own corps, 
with an escort of one hundred men, who are to guard 
some provisions up, so that my fears and doubts on that 
head are now removed. 
</p><p>
I had a letter yesterday from Orme, who writes me 
word, that they have passed the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=youghiogany" rel="city">Youghiogany</a> for the 
last time ; that they have sent out parties to scour the 
country thereabouts, and have reason to believe the 
French are greatly alarmed at their approach.

</p><p>
DEAR ORME, 
</p><p>
I came to this camp on Thursday last, with the rear 
of Colonel Dunbar's detachment, and should have continued on with his front to-day, but was prevented by rain. 
</p><p>
My fevers are very moderate, and, I hope, near terminating. Then I shall have nothing to encounter but 
weakness, which is excessive, and the difficulty of getting to you, arising therefrom ; but this I would not miss 
doing, before you reach Duquesne, for five hundred pounds. However, I have no doubt now of doing it, as 
I am moving on, and the General has given me his word of honor, in the most solemn manner, that it shall be effected. 
</p><p>
As the Doctor thinks it imprudent for me to use much 
exercise for two or three days, my movements will be 
retarded. I should be glad, therefore, to be advised of 
your marches from Gist's, and how you are likely to 
proceed, for you may rest assured, that Colonel Dunbar 
cannot remove from this present encampment in less 
than two or three days ; and I believe, really, it will be 
as much as he possibly can do to reach the Meadows at 
all, so that you will be greatly in advance of him. 
</p><p>
I am too weak to add more, than my compliments to 
the General and the family, and again to desire, that you 
will oblige me in the above request, and devise the most 
effectual means for me to join you. I am, dear Orme, 
your most obedient servant.

Captain Orme, being confined to his litter, and not

of yours. He begs the favor of you to have the room 
the General lodged in prepared for Colonel Burton, himself, and Captain Morris, who are all wounded ; also, 
that some small place may be had convenient for cooking ; and, if any fresh provision, and other necessaries 
for persons in their condition, may be had, that you will 
engage them. 
</p><p>
The horses, which carry the wounded gentlemen in 
litters, are so much fatigued, that we dread their performance ; therefore, it is desired that you will be kind 
enough to send out eight or ten fresh horses for their 
relief, which will enable us to reach the fort this evening.

I doubt not but you have had an account of the poor 
gentlemen's death by some of the affrighted wagoners,

</p><p>
HONORED MADAM, 
</p><p>
As I doubt not but you have heard of our defeat, and, 
perhaps, had it represented in a worse light, if possible, 
than it deserves, I have taken this earliest opportunity 
to give you some account of the engagement as it happened, within ten miles of the French fort, on Wednesday the 9th instant. 
</p><p>
We marched to that place, without any considerable 
loss, having only now and then a straggler picked up by 
the French and scouting Indians. When we came there, 
we were attacked by a party of French and Indians, 
whose number, I am persuaded, did not exceed three hundred men; while ours consisted of about one thousand 
three hundred well-armed troops, chiefly regular soldiers, 
who were struck with such a panic, that they behaved 
with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive. The 
officers behaved gallantly, in order to encourage their 
men, for which they suffered greatly, there being near 
sixty killed and wounded; a large proportion of the 
number we had. 
</p><p>
The Virginia troops showed a good deal of bravery, 
and were nearly all killed ; for I believe, out of three 
companies that were there, scarcely thirty men are left 
alive. Captain Peyrouny, and all his officers down to a 
corporal, were killed. Captain Poison had nearly as 
hard a fate, for only one of his was left, f In short, the 
dastardly behaviour of those they call regulars exposed 
all others, that were inclined to do their duty, to almost 
certain death ; and, at last, in despite of all the efforts 
of the officers to the contrary, they ran, as sheep pursued by dogs, and it was impossible to rally them. 
</p><p>
The General was wounded, of which he died three days after. Sir Peter Halket was killed in the field, 
where died many other brave officers. I luckily escaped without a wound, though I had four 'bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me. Captains Orme and Morris, two of the aids-de-camp, were wounded 
early in the engagement, which rendered the duty harder upon me, as I was the only person then left to 
distribute the General's orders, which I was scarcely able to do, as I was not half recovered from a violent illness, that had confined me to my bed and a wagon for 
above ten days. I am still in a weak and feeble condition, which induces me to halt here two or three days 
in the hope of recovering a little strength, to enable me 
to proceed homewards ; from whence, I fear, I shall not 
be able to stir till towards September ; so that I shall 
not have the pleasure of seeing you till then, unless it 
be in Fairfax. Please to give my love to Mr. Lewis 
and my sister; and compliments to Mr. Jackson, and 
all other friends that inquire after me. I am, honored 
Madam, your most dutiful son.

As I have heard, since my arrival at this place, a circumstantial account of my death and dying speech, I 
take this early opportunity of contradicting the first, and 
of assuring you, that I have not as yet composed the 
latter. But, by the all-powerful dispensations of Providence, I have been protected beyond all human probability or expectation ; for I had four bullets through my 
coat, and two horses shot under me, yet escaped unhurt, 
although death was levelling my companions on every 
side of me ! 
</p><p>
We have been most scandalously beaten by a trifling 
body of men, but fatigue and want of time prevent me 
from giving you any of the details, until I have the happiness of seeing you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, which I now

A feeble state of health obliges me to halt here for 
two or three days, to recover a little strength, that I 
may thereby be enabled to proceed homewards with 
more ease. You may expect to see me there on Saturday or Sunday fortnight, which is as soon as I can 
well be down, as I shall take my Bullskin Plantations

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I must acknowledge you had great reason to be terrified at the first accounts, that were given of our unhappy 
defeat ; and, I must own, I was not a little surprised to 
find, that Governor Innes was the means of alarming 
the country with a report so extraordinary, without having better confirmation of the truth, than the story of an 
affrighted wagoner ! 
</p><p>
It is true, we have been beaten, shamefully beaten, 
by a handful of men, who only intended to molest and 
disturb our march. Victory was their smallest expectation. But see the wondrous works of Providence, 
and the uncertainty of human things ! We, but a few 
moments before, believed our numbers almost equal to 
the Canadian force ; they only expected to annoy us. 
Yet, contrary to all expectation and human probability, 
and even to the common course of things, we were 
totally defeated, and sustained the loss of every thing. 
This, as you observe, must be an affecting story to the 
colony, and will, no doubt, license the tongues of people 
to censure those, whom they think most blamable; 
which, by the by, often falls very wrongfully. I join 
very heartily with you in believing, that when this story 
comes to be related in future annals, it will meet with 
unbelief and indignation, for had I not been witness to the fact on that fatal day, I should scarcely have given credit to it even now.

Whenever it suits you to come into Fairfax, I hope you will make your home at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>. I assure

DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
The pleasure of your company at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> 
always did, and always will, afford me infinite satisfaction ; but, at this time, I am too sensible how needful 
the country is of all the assistance of its members, to 
have a wish to hear that any are absent from the Assembly. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely wish, that unanimity may prevail in 
all your counsels, and that a happy issue may attend 
your deliberations at this important crisis. 
</p><p>
I am not able, were I ever so willing, to meet you in 
town, for, I assure you, it is with some difficulty, and 
much fatigue, that I visit my plantations ; so much has 
a sickness of five weeks' continuance reduced me. But 
though it is not in my power to meet you there, I can 
nevertheless assure you, and others "whom it may concern," (to borrow a phrase from Governor Innes,) that, 
so little am I dispirited at what has happened, I am always ready, and always willing, to render my country 
any services that I am capable of, but never upon the 
terms I have done ; having suffered much in my private 
fortune, besides impairing one of the best of constitutions. 
</p><p>
I was employed to go a journey in the winter, when, 
I believe, few or none would have undertaken it, and 
what did I get by it ? My expenses borne ! I then was 
appointed, with trifling pay, to conduct a handful of men 
to the Ohio. What did I get by that? Why, after 
putting myself to a considerable expense, in equipping 
and providing necessaries for the campaign, I went out, 
was soundly beaten, and lost them all ! came in, and 
had my commission taken from me, or, in other words, 
my command reduced, under pretence of an order from 
home ! I then went out a volunteer with General Braddock, and lost all my horses, and many other things. 
But this being a voluntary act, I ought not to have mentioned it ; nor should I have done it, were it not to show, 
that I have been upon the losing order ever since I entered the service, which is now nearly two years. So 
that I think I cannot be blamed, should I, if I leave my 
family again, endeavour to do it upon such terms, as to 
prevent my suffering ; to gain by it being the least of 
my expectations. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but you have heard the particulars of our 
shameful defeat, which really was so scandalous, that I 
hate to mention it. You desire to know what artillery 
was taken in the late engagement. It is easily told. 
We lost all that we carried out, excepting two sixpounders, and a few cohorns, which were left with 
Colonel Dunbar ; and the cohorns have since been destroyed to accelerate his flight. You also ask, whether 
I think the forces can march out again this fall. I answer, I think it impossible, at least, for them to do the 
French any damage (unless it be by starving them), for the want of a proper train of artillery ; yet they may be 
very serviceable in erecting small fortresses at convenient places to deposit provisions in, by which means 
the country will be eased of an immense expense in the 
carriage, and it will also be a means of securing a retreat, if we should be put to the rout again. The 
success of this measure, however, will depend greatly 
upon what Governor Shirley does at Niagara ; for, if he 
succeeds, their communication with Canada will be entirely cut off. 
</p><p>
It is impossible for me to guess at the number of 
recruits, that may be wanted, as that must depend altogether upon the strength of the French on the Ohio, 
which, to my great astonishment, we were always 
strangers to. 
</p><p>
I thank you, very heartily, for your kind offer of a 
chair, and for your goodness in sending my things ; and, 
after begging you to excuse the imperfections of this 
letter, which, in part, are owing to my having much 
company that hurries me, I shall conclude, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate brother.

If it is in my power to avoid going to the Ohio again, I shall ; but if the command is pressed upon me, by the 
general voice of the country, and offered upon such terms as cannot be objected against, it would reflect 
dishonor upon me to refuse it ; and that, I am sure, must or ought to give you greater uneasiness, than my going 
in an honorable command. Upon no other terms will I accept of it. At present I have no proposals made to

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After returning you most sincere and grateful thanks, 
for your kind condolence on my late indisposition, and 
for the generous and (give me leave farther to say) partial 
opinion, you have entertained of my military abilities, I 
must express my concern for not having it in my power 
to meet you, and other friends, who have signified their 
desire of seeing me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. 
</p><p>
Your letter only came to hand at nine last night, and 
you inform me, that the Assembly will break up the 
latter end of the week, which allows a time too short in 
which to perform a journey of a hundred and sixty 
miles, especially 'by a person in my feeble condition; 
for, although I am happily recovered from the disorder, 
which brought me to so low an ebb, by a sickness 
of nearly five weeks' continuance, yet my strength is not returned. Had I received timely notice, I would 
have attempted the ride, by slow and easy journeys, if it 
had been only for the satisfaction of seeing my friends, 
who, I flatter myself, from what you say, are kind enough 
to sympathize in my good and evil fortunes. 
</p><p>
The chief cause, next to indisposition, that prevented 
me from going down to this Assembly, was a determination not to offer my services ; and that determination 
proceeded from the following reasons. First, a belief 
that I could not get a command upon such terms as I 
should incline to accept; for I must confess to you, that 
I never will quit my family, injure my fortune, and, above 
all, impair my health, to run the risk of such changes 
and vicissitudes, as I have met with, but shall expect, if 
I am employed again, to have something certain. Again, 
were I to accept the command, I should insist upon 
some things, which ignorance and inexperience made 
me overlook before, particularly that of having the officers appointed, in some measure, with my advice and 
with my concurrence. It appears to me strange, that a 
commanding officer should not have this liberty, when 
it is considered how much the conduct and bravery of 
an officer influence the men, how much a commanding 
officer is answerable for the behaviour of the inferior 
officers, and how much his good or ill success, in time 
of action, depends upon the conduct of each particular 
one, especially too, in this kind of fighting, where, being 
dispersed, each and every one of them has a greater 
liberty to misbehave, than if he were regularly and 
compactly drawn up under the eyes of his superior. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, how little credit is given to a 
commander, who, after a defeat, in relating the cause of 
it, justly lays the blame on some individual, whose cowardly behaviour betrayed the whole to ruin. How little 
does the world consider the circumstances, and how apt are mankind to level their vindictive censures against the 
unfortunate chief, who perhaps merited least of the blame. 
</p><p>
Does it not appear, then, that the appointing of officers is a thing of the utmost consequence ; a thing that 
requires the greatest circumspection 1 Ought it to be 
left to blind chance, or, what is still worse, to partiality ? 
Should it not be left to a man, whose life, and, what i 
still dearer, whose honor, depends on their good behaviour 
</p><p>
Officers are yet wanting, for whom no provision h 
been made. A small military chest is so necessary, 
that it is impossible to do without it, nor .can any man 
conduct an affair of this kind, who has it not. 
</p><p>
These things I should expect, if the appointment should fall upon me. 
</p><p>
But, besides all these, I had other reasons, which 
withheld me from offering my services. I believe our 
circumstances are brought to such an unhappy dilemma, 
that no man can gain any honor by conducting our forces 
at this time, but will rather lose in his reputation if he 
attempts it. I am confident, that the progress of military movements must be slow, for want of conveniences 
to transport our provisions, ammunition, and stores, over 
the mountains ; occasioned, in a great measure, by the 
late ill treatment of the wagoners and horse- drivers, 
who have received little compensation for their labor, 
and nothing for their lost horses and wagons ; wilich 
will be an infallible cause of preventing all from assisting, 
who are not compelled. Hence I am fully sensible, that 
whoever undertakes this command will meet with such 
insurmountable obstacles, that he will soon be viewed in 
the light of an idle, indolent body, have his conduct 
criticized, and meet perhaps with abuse, when it may 
be as much out of his power to avoid delays, as it would 
be to command the raging seas in a storm. 
</p><p>
This view of things has had no small influence upon 
me, as I am very apprehensive I should lose, what at 
present constitutes the chief part of my happiness, that 
is, the esteem and notice, which the country has been 
pleased to honor me with. 
</p><p>
It is possible you may infer from what I have said, 
that my intentions are to decline, at all events ; but this 
is not my meaning. I am determined not to offer ; because to solicit the command, and, at the same time, to 
make my proposals, w r ould be a little incongruous, and 
carry with it the face of self-sufficiency. But if the 
command should be offered to me, the case will then be 
altered, as I should be at liberty to make such objections, 
as reason and my small experience have pointed out
</p><p>
I am, dear Warner, your most affectionate friend, and obedient servant.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES, VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 11 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
After a small halt at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, to issue orders 
to the recruiting officers appointed to that rendezvous, 
I proceeded to this place, in order to collect a return of 
the provisions and clothing, that were lodged here ; an 
exact copy of which I herewith send you. I find, after 
the soldiers have their short allowances, there will arise 
great inconveniences, if stores of clothing are not laid in 
to supply their wants ; particularly shoes, stockings, and 
shirts, for these are the least durable and most needed. 
</p><p>
The method I would recommend is, for the country 
to provide these things, and lodge them, or a convenient 
part of them, in the hands of the quartermaster, who 
may be appointed to receive and deliver them to the 
soldiers, by particular orders from their captains, taking 
care to produce these orders and proper vouchers for 
the delivery, each pay-day, when the amount must be 
deducted out of the soldier's pay, who receives them. 
This, I think, will be a means of keeping them always 
provided and fit for duty, and of preventing the officers 
from supplying the men, which is generally attended 
with misunderstandings. It will also be a means of 
discouraging followers of the army from demanding 
such exorbitant prices, as is usually practised on these 
occasions. 
</p><p>
However, I only offer this as the most efficacious 
method I can at present think of. If any more eligible 
one can be found, I should be glad to see it executed, as 
something of the kind must be done, otherwise the soldiers will be barefoot, which is always a plea for exemption from duty ; and, indeed, in the approaching season 
it will be a very just one. You will be a judge, when you see the returns, what had best be done with the 
provisions. The quantity is too great for the present 
consumption, and to wagon it up can never answer the expense. 
</p><p>
Major Carlyle thinks the West India market best, as 
the returns will be in rum, which he can soon turn into flour at the camp. 
</p><p>
I am afraid I shall not be able to push things with 
vigor this fall, for want of a commissary who will act 
with spirit. Mr. Dick seems determined not to enter 
into any further contracts, unless he is better supported, 
or until he meets the Committee in October ; by which 
time the best season for engaging beef will be almost 
over. The Governor, by the advice of Sir John St. Clair, 
expressed, just as I was coming away, his desire of having him continued ; so that I am entirely ignorant how 
to act. The making of contracts myself is foreign to my 
duty ; neither have I time ; and to see the service suffer 
will give me infinite uneasiness, as I would gladly conduct every thing, as far as I am capable, with life and 
spirit. This never can be done unless a fund of money 
is lodged in camp for defraying the contingent charges. 
As I believed it difficult to get all the clothing in any 
one part of the country, I engaged it where I could, and 
have got shoes, stockings, shirts, and hats enough upon 
tolerably good terms, as you may see by the enclosed. 
</p><p>
Major Carlyle is also willing to engage one hundred 
complete suits, as good as those imported, for three 
pounds, or less ; with which I have acquainted the Governor. I believe them to be as cheap as can be got 
below, as it is the making chiefly, that occasions the 
difference between those imported, and those provided 
here. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived at this place in less than three hours after I 
wrote you from Colonel Baylor's. Shortly afterwards 
arrived also Colonel Stephen, who gives a worse account, than he related in his letter; but as he is the 
bearer of this, I shall be the less prolix, referring to him 
for particulars. 
</p><p>
I shall set out this evening for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, where I 
expect to be joined by the recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> and 
this place, as soon as they can possibly march that distance ; also, by one hundred men from Prince William 
and Frederic. I have written to Fairfax county, desiring that a troop of horse may hold themselves in 
readiness to march at an hour's warning. So that I doubt 
not, that, with this assistance, I shall be able to repulse 
the enemy, if they are still committing their outrages 
upon the inhabitants. We are at a loss for want of 
almost every necessary, tents, kettles, arms, ammunition^ and cartridge-paper. I hope, as your Honor 
did not send to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> for them, you will, if 
possible, endeavour to get them below, and send them 
</p><p>
ing the necessary orders, and collecting returns of the provisions and 
clothing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and stores at Rock Creek, I proceeded to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, where I arrived on the 14th of September. Thence I went to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and took upon me the command of the troops there, 
issuing the daily orders, and giving such instructions and directions as appeared necessary. Thence to Fort Dinwiddie on Jackson's River. After 
examining the state of things there, I set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and arrived 
on the 2d of October. On the 5th reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> in my way to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. Continued my journey to Colonel Baylor's, where I was 
overtaken by an express sent from Colonel Stephen (commanding at Fort 
Cumberland), informing me that a body of Indians had fallen upon the inhabitants, killed many of them, and destroyed and burnt several of their 
houses. Thereupon I wrote to the Governor, and returned immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>." 
</p><p>
I must again take the liberty of mentioning to you 
the necessity of putting the militia, when they are drawn 
out into actual service, under better regulation than they 
are at present, as well as of putting us under a military 
law. Otherwise we shall only be a burthensome charge 
to the country, and the others will prove its ruin. That 
this may not appear an unmeaning expression, I refer 
you to Lieutenant- Colonel Stephen, who can give you 
some late proofs of their disobedience and inconsistent 
behaviour. 
</p><p>
As these affairs will take some time, I find I cannot 
possibly be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> till the 6th, 7th, or 8th of 
November, when I should be glad to meet a committee, 
in order to settle with them and your Honor some 
points, that are very necessary for the good of the expedition. 
</p><p>
Colonel Stephen has orders to receive some money 
below, that we may be enabled to pay the troops, keep 
them in spirits, and answer such immediate charges as 
cannot be dispensed with, until I come down. I should 
be glad if your Honor would order him to repair therewith (as soon as he has done his business with the committee) to Winchester ; and from thence, with a proper 
guard, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I hope the treasury will 
have a sufficient sum of money prepared against I come 
down, that I may meet with no delay. 
</p><p>
There are about seventy recruits at this place, and I 
left twenty-five at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>. I suppose they are augmented before this time by officers, who, I am sorry to 
say, have paid slight regard to orders, by not being in at 
the time appointed. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
As I think it my indispensable duty to inform you 
particularly of my proceedings, and to give the most 
plain and authentic accounts, from time to time, of our 
situation, I must acquaint you that, immediately after 
giving" the necessary orders at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, and 
despatching expresses to hurry the recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, I rode post to this place. I passed by Lord 
Fairfax's, who was not at home, but was here, where I 
arrived yesterday about noon, and found every thing in 
the greatest hurry and confusion, by the back inhabitants 
flocking in, and those of this town moving out, which I 
have, as far as was in my power, prevented. I was desirous of proceeding immediately, at the head of some 
militia, to put a stop to the ravages of the enemy, believing their numbers to be few; but I was told by 
Colonel Martin, who had attempted to raise the militia 
for the same purpose, that it was impossible to get above 
twenty or twenty-five men, they having absolutely refused to stir, choosing, as they say, to die with their 
wives and families. 
</p><p>
Finding this expedient likely to prove abortive, I 
sent off expresses to hurry on the recruits from below, 
and the militia from Fairfax and Prince William, who 
had been ordered out by Lord Fairfax. I also hired 
spies to go out and discover the numbers of the enemy, 
and to encourage the rangers, who, we were told, were 
blocked up by the Indians in small fortresses. But, if I 
may offer my opinion, I believe they are more encompassed with fear, than by the enemy. I have also 
impressed wagons and sent them to Conococheague for 
flour, musket-balls, and flints. Powder, and a trifling quantity of paper, bought at extravagant prices, for cartridges, I expect from below. 
</p><p>
Six or eight smiths are now at work, repairing the 
firearms that are here, which are all that we have to depend upon. A man was hired, on the 24th of last 
month, to do the whole, but neglected it, and was just 
moving off to Pennsylvania in wagons. I impressed his 
wagons, and compelled him by force to assist in this 
work. In all things I meet with the greatest opposition. 
</p><p>
No orders are obeyed, but such as a party of soldiers, 
or my own drawn sword, enforces. Without this, not 
a single horse, for the most earnest occasion, can be 
had, to such a pitch has the insolence of these people 
arrived, by having every point hitherto submitted to 
them. However, I have given up none, where his Majesty's service requires the contrary, and where my proceedings are justified by my instructions; nor will I, 
unless they execute what they threaten, that is, " blow 
out our brains." 
</p><p>
I have invited the poor distressed people, who were 
driven from their habitations, to lodge their families in 
some place of security, and to join our parties in scouring the woods, where the enemy lie ; and I believe 
some will cheerfully assist. I have also taken, and shall 
continue to take, every previous step to forward the 
march of the recruits, as soon as they arrive here. Your 
Honor may depend, that nothing in my power shall be 
wanting for the good of the service. I would again hint 
the necessity of putting the militia under a better regulation, had I not mentioned it twice before, and a third 
time may seem impertinent. But I must once more 
beg leave to declare, for here I am more immediately 
concerned, that, unless the Assembly will pass an act to 
enforce the military law in all its parts, I must, with 
great regret, decline the honor that has been so generously intended me. I am urged to this, by the foreknowledge I have of failing in every point, that might 
justly be expected from a person invested with full 
power to execute his authority. I see the growing 
insolence of the soldiers, and the indolence and inactivity 
of the officers, who are all sensible how limited their 
punishments are, compared with what they ought to be. 
In fine, I can plainly see, that under the present establishment, we shall become a nuisance, an insupportable 
charge to our country, and never answer any one expectation of the Assembly. And here I must assume 
the freedom to express some surprise, that we alone 
should be so tenacious of our liberty, as not to invest a 
power, where interest and policy so unanswerably demand it, and whence so much good must consequently 
ensue. Do we not know, that every nation under the 
sun finds its account therein, and that, without it, no order 
or regularity can be observed 1 Why then should it be 
expected from us, who are all young and inexperienced, 
to govern and keep up a proper spirit of discipline without laws, when the best and most experienced can 
scarcely do it with them ? If we consult our interest, I 
am sure it loudly calls for them. I can confidently 
assert, that recruiting, clothing, arming, maintaining, and 
subsisting soldiers, who have since deserted, have cost 
the country an immense sum, which might have been 
prevented, were we under restraints, that would terrify 
the soldiers from such practices. 
</p><p>
One thing more on this head I will recommend, and 
then quit the subject ; that is, to have the inhabitants 
liable to certain heavy fines, or corporal punishments, 
for entertaining deserters, and a reward offered for taking them up. If this were done, it would be next to an 
impossibility for a soldier to escape ; but, as things now 
stand, they are not only seduced to run away, but are also harboured and assisted with every necessary means 
to do it. 
</p><p>
Sunday noon. Last night arrived an express, just 
spent with fatigue and fear, reporting that a party of 
Indians were seen about twelve miles off, at the plantation of one Isaac Julian, and that the inhabitants were 
flying in the most promiscuous manner from their dwellings. I immediately ordered the town guards to be 
strengthened, Perkins's lieutenant to be in readiness 
with his companies, some recruits, who had only arrived 
about half an hour before, to be armed, and sent two 
men, well acquainted with the roads, to go up that road, 
and lie in wait, to see if they could discover the number and motion of the Indians, that we might have 
timely notice of their approach. This morning, before 
we could parade the men, arrived a second express, ten 
times more terrified than the former, with information, 
that the Indians had got within four miles of the town, 
and were killing and destroying all before them, and that 
he himself had heard constant firing, and shrieks of the 
unhappy murdered ! Upon this, I immediately collected 
what force I could, which consisted of twenty -two men, 
recruited for the rangers, and nineteen of the militia, 
and marched directly to the place, where these horrid 
murders were said to be committed. When we came 
there, whom should we find occasioning all this disturbance, but three drunken soldiers of the light-horse, 
carousing, firing their pistols, and uttering the most 
unheard-of imprecations ? These we took, and marched 
them as prisoners to town, where we met the men I 
sent out last night, and learned that the party of Indians, 
discovered by Isaac Julian, proved to be a mulatto and 
negro, seen hunting cattle by his child, who alarmed the 
father, and the father the neighbourhood. 
</p><p>
These circumstances are related only to show what a panic prevails among the people ; how much they are 
alarmed at the most usual and customary cries; and yet how impossible it is to get them to act in any respect 
for their common safety. As an instance of this, Colonel Fairfax, who arrived in town while we were upon a 
scout, immediately sent to a noble captain, not far off, to repair with his company forthwith to Winchester. With 
coolness and moderation this great captain answered, that his wife, family, and corn were all at stake; so 
were those of his soldiers ; therefore it was impossible for him to come. Such is the example of the officers ; 
such the behaviour of the men ; and upon such circumstances depends the safety of our country ! 
</p><p>
Monday morning. The men I hired to bring intelligence from the Branch returned last night, with letters 
from Captain Ashby, and the other parties there ; by which I learn, that the Indians are gone off; scouts 
having been dispersed upon those waters for several days, without discovering tracks or other signs of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I am also informed, that it is believed their numbers 
amounted to about one hundred and fifty ; that seventy 
of our men are killed and missing, and several houses 
and plantations destroyed, but not so great havoc made 
as was represented at first. The rangers, and a small 
company of militia, ordered there by Lord Fairfax, I am 
given to understand, intend to march down on Monday 
next. They will be immediately followed by all the 
inhabitants of those parts, that had come together under 
their protection. I have, therefore, sent peremptory 
orders to the contrary ; but what obedience will be paid 
to them a little time will reveal. I have ordered those 
men, that were recruited for the rangers, to join their 
respective companies. A party of militia, commanded 
by Captain Harden, also marched with them. Captain 
Waggener is this instant arrived with thirty recruits, 
whom he marched from Bellhaven in less than three 
days, a great march indeed ! Major Lewis and his 
recruits from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> I expect in to-morrow, 
when, with these and twenty-two of Captain Bell's now 
here, I shall proceed by quick marches to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, in order to strengthen that garrison. Besides 
these, I think it absolutely essential, that there should 
be two or three companies exclusively of rangers, to 
guard the Potomac waters, until such time as our regiment is completed. Indeed, the rangers and volunteer 
companies in Augusta, with some of their militia, should 
be properly disposed of on those frontiers, for fear of an 
attack from that quarter. But this is submitted to your 
Honor's judgment, and waits your orders for its execution, if thought expedient. 
</p><p>
Captain Waggener informs me, that it was with 
difficulty he passed the Ridge for crowds of people, 
who were flying as if every moment was death. He 
endeavoured, but in vain, to stop them ; they firmly 
believing that Winchester was in flames. I shall send 
expresses down the several roads in hopes of bringing 
back the inhabitants, who are really frightened out of 
their senses. I despatched an express immediately 
upon my arrival at this place, with a copy of the enclosed letter to Andrew Montour, who I heard was at a 
place called Long Island, with three hundred Indians, 
to see if he could engage him and them to join us. I 
also wrote to Gist, acquainting him with the favor you 
intended him, and desired he would repair home, in 
order to raise his companies of scouts. 
</p><p>
I shall defer writing to the Speaker and Committee 
upon any other head, than that of commissary, still hoping to be down by the time mentioned in my last, 
provided no new disturbances happen, having some 
points to settle, that I am uneasy and urgent about. I 
have been obliged to do duty very foreign to my own ; 
but that I shall never hesitate about, when the good of 
the service requires it. 
</p><p>
In a journey from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> to Fort Dinwiddie, which I made purposely to see the situation of our 
frontiers, how the rangers were posted, and how troops might be disposed of for the defence of the country, I 
purchased six hundred and fifty beeves, to be delivered at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> by the 1st of November, at ten 
shillings per hundred weight, except a few for which I was obliged to give eleven shillings. My own bonds 
are now out for the performance of these covenants. This is the commissary's business, who, I am sorry to 
say, has hitherto been of no use, but of disservice to me, in neglecting my orders, and leaving this place without 
flour, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> without any provisions for the recruits, although he had timely notice. I must beg, 
that, if Mr. Dick will not act, some other person may be appointed ; for, if things remain in this uncertain situation, the season will pass without having provision made 
for the winter, or the summer campaign. 
</p><p>
I have appointed Captain George Mercer (whose seniority entitled him to it) my aid-de-camp ; and 
Mr. Kirkpatrick, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, my secretary, a young man bred to business, of good character, well recommended, and a person of whose abilities I had not the least doubt. 
</p><p>
I hope your Honor will be kind enough to despatd 
Colonel Stephen, with orders to repair hither immediately, and excuse the prolixity of this letter. I was 
willing to give a circumstantial account of our situation, 
that you may be the better enabled to judge what orders 
are necessary. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Last night by the return of the express, who went to 
Captain Montour, I received the enclosed from Mr. Harris at the Susquehanna. I think no means should be 
neglected to preserve the few Indians, who still remain 
in our interest. For which reason I shall send Mr. Gist, 
as soon as he arrives (which I expect will be to-day), 
to Harris's Ferry, in hopes of engaging and bringing 
with him the Belt of Wampum and other Indians at that 
place. I shall further desire him to send an Indian express to Andrew Montour, to try if he cannot be brought 
with them. 
</p><p>
In however trifling a light the attempts of the French 
to alienate the affections of our southern Indians may at 
first appear, I must look upon it as a thing of the utmost 
consequence, requiring our greatest and most immediate 
attention. I have often wondered at not hearing this 
was attempted before, and had it noted among other 
memorandums to acquaint your Honor with, when I 
should come down. 
</p><p>
The French policy in treating with the Indians is so 
prevalent, that I should not be in the least surprised, 
were they to engage the Cherokees, Catawbas, and 
others, unless timely and vigorous measures are taken 
to prevent it. 
</p><p>
A pusillanimous behaviour now will ill suit the times ; 
and trusting to traders and common interpreters, who 
will sell their integrity to the highest bidder, may prove 
the destruction of these affairs. I therefore think, that 
if a person of distinction, acquainted with their language, 
is to be found, his price should be come to at any rate. 
If no such person can be had, a man of sense and character, who may conduct the Indians to a council, or 
superintend any other matters, will be found extremely 
necessary. It is impertinent, I own, in me to offer my 
opinion in these affairs, when better judges may direct ; 
but my steady and hearty zeal for the cause, and the 
great impositions I have known practised by the traders 
upon these occasions, would not suffer me to be quite 
silent. I have heard, from undoubted authority, that 
some of the Cherokees, introduced to us as sachems 
and princes by the interpreter, who shares the profits, 
have been no other than common hunters, and bloodthirsty villains. 
</p><p>
We have no accounts yet of the militia from Fairfax. 
This day I march with about one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland. Yesterday an express informed me of 
eighty recruits at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, whom I have ordered 
to proceed to this place ; but, for want of that regularity 
being observed, by which I should know where every 
officer is, my orders are only conditional, and always confused. The commissary is much wanted. I hope 
you will send him up immediately ; if not, things will greatly suffer here. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your two letters by Jenkins last night, and was greatly surprised to hear that Commissary Walker was not arrived at camp, when he came away. He set 
out from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> about the 12th instant, with orders to proceed immediately up ; but such disobedience 
of commands, as I have generally met with, is insufferable, and shall not go unpunished. The account you 
enclosed of the method of receiving the beef, I suppose, is customary ; but for want of knowledge in those affairs, I can neither applaud nor condemn it. 
</p><p>
The Governor did not seem inclined to promote the removal of the fort; however, the Committee have lodged a discretionary power in my hands, and have 
resolved to pay for all extraordinary labor. I would, therefore, have as little labor lost at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> as possible ; at least, until I come up, which will be very 
shortly, my stay here being only for a few days, in order to receive recruits, and hurry up the stores to Winchester. 
</p><p>
I believe those, who say Governor Sharpe is to command, can only wish it. I do not know that General 
Shirley has a power to appoint a chief to our forces, to regulars he may. As to that affair of turning the store-house into a dwelling-room, I do not know what 
better answer to give, than saying, that this is one among the many instances, which might be offered, of the inconvenience of having the fort in Maryland. As 
soon as I hear from Governor Shirley, which is hourly expected, I can then send a more determinate answer. 
</p><p>
There has been such total negligence among the recruiting officers in general, such disregard of the service 
they were employed in, and such idle proceedings, that I am determined to send out none until we all meet, 
when each officer shall have his own men, and have 
only this alternative, either to complete his number, or 
lose his commission. Several officers have been out six 
weeks, or two months, without getting a man, spending 
their time in all the gayety of pleasurable mirth, with 
their relations and friends ; not attempting, nor having 
possible chance to recruit any but those, who, out of 
their inclination to the service, will proffer themselves. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to have ten or twelve wagons sent 
to this place. Salt enough may be had here to load that 
number, and it is obtained upon easier terms than at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, by sixpence or eight pence per bushel. 
Those stores at Watkins's Ferry should be hurried up 
as fast as the water affords opportunities, if it were only 
to prevent disputes. 
</p><p>
If the paymaster is at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and not on his 
way to Fort Dinwiddie, order him down here immediately. If he should be going with pay to Captain Hogg, 
he is to proceed with despatch ; but if he is at Fort 
Cumberland, order him down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, to wait 
there until I arrive. I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Captain John Mercer only returned last night from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and brings no satisfactory answers to any thing I questioned the Governor upon. 
</p><p>
The express, that was sent to General Shirley, has 
returned without seeing him. However, the Governor 
writes that he expects answers to his letters by Colonel 
Hunter, who is now at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and waits the arrival 
of the General at that place. The Governor is very 
strongly of opinion, that Captain Dag worthy has no 
right to contend for the command ; and in his letter he 
says, after mentioning the return of the express, and his 
expectation of satisfactory letters, " But I am of opinion 
you might have obviated the inconsistent dispute with 
Captain Dagworthy, by asking him if he did not command a provincial company by virtue of Governor 
Sharpe's commission ; as that he had formerly from his 
Majesty now ceases, as he is not on the half-pay list. 
If so, the method you are to take is very obvious, as 
your commission from me is greater than what he has." 
And in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, when I was down there, both he 
and Colonel Fitzhugh told me, that Dagworthy could 
have no more pretensions to command me, or either of 
the field-officers of the Virginia regiment, than we have 
to command General Shirley; and further gave it as 
their opinion, that as Dagworthy's was only a botchedup commission at best, and as he commanded a provincial company, and by virtue of a governor's commission, 
he ought to be arrested for his presumption. They say, 
allowing his commission from the King to be valid, yet, 
as he is not there by order of his Majesty, he can have 
no better pretensions to assume the command, than a 
visiting half-pay officer, who transiently passes through the camp. 
</p><p>
I wish you would sound him on this head, and hear 
how he will answer these things, and let me know when 
you come down, which I desire may be immediately, as 
I want much to consult you upon several accounts. The 
paymaster, and commissary, if not very much engaged, 
must accompany you. Desire both to have their accounts settled, and brought with them, as that is necessary before I can give more money. 
</p><p>
I have sent you one of the mutiny bills, which I 
received from below, but I believe it is necessary, as we 
still want the power, to postpone trials until after your 
return. 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a commission for Captain Waggener, 
which I have neglected giving before. Desire him, as 
the command upon your leaving the place will devolve 
upon him, to be very circumspect in his duty, and to 
see that the troops are duly drawn out and trained to 
their exercise, and practised to bush-fighting.

As I expect in a very few days to have the pleasure 
of seeing you, I shall only add, I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am sorry it has not been in my power to acknowledge the receipt of yours until now. At the time your 
letter came to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> ;. before I got back, it was conveyed thither ; and so from 
place to place it has been tossing almost until this time. 
</p><p>
There is nothing more necessary than good intelligence to frustrate a designing enemy, and nothing that 
requires greater pains to obtain. I shall, therefore, 
cheerfully come into any measures you can propose to 
settle a correspondence for this salutary end ; and you 
may depend upon receiving (when the provinces are 
threatened) the earliest and best intelligence I can 
procure. 
</p><p>
I sympathized in a general concern to see the inactivity of your province in a time of imminent danger ; 
but am pleased to find, that a feeling sense of wrongs has roused the spirit of your martial Assembly to vote 
a sum, which, with your judicious application, will turn to a general good.
</p><p>
We took some pretty vigorous measures to collect a 
force upon our frontiers, upon the first alarm, which has 
kept us peaceable ever since. How long this may last 
is uncertain, since that force, which consisted of militia, 
is disbanded, and the recruiting service almost stagnated. 
</p><p>
If you propose to levy troops, and their destination is 
not a secret, I should be favored w r ere I let into the 
scheme, that we may act conjunctly, so far as the nature of things will admit.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Major Lewis, being at Winchester when your letter 
came to hand, was immediately despatched to Augusta, 
to take upon him the command of the troops destined 
against the Shawanese Town ; with orders to follow 
such directions as he should receive from you. This 
scheme I am apprehensive will prove abortive, as we 
are told that those Indians are removed up the river, 
into the neighbourhood of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
I have given all necessary orders for- training the men 
to a proper use of their arms, and the method of Indian 
fighting, and hope in a little time to make them expert. 
I should be glad to have your Honor's express commands, either to prepare for taking the field, or for 
guarding our frontiers in the spring, because the steps 
for these two operations are very different. I have 
already built two forts on Patterson's Creek, which have 
caused the chief part of the inhabitants to return to their 
plantations ; and have now ordered Captain Waggener 
with sixty men to build and garrison two others, at 
places I have pointed out high up the South Branch, 
which will be a means of securing near a hundred miles 
of our frontiers, exclusive of the command at Fort Dinwiddie, on Jackson's River. And, indeed, without a 
much greater number of men than we have a prospect 
of raising, I do not see how it is possible to think of 
passing the mountains, or acting more than defensively. 
This seems to be the full determination of the Pennsylvanians; so that there can be no hope of assistance 
from that quarter. If we only act defensively, I would 
most earnestly recommend the building of a strong fort at some convenient place in Virginia, as that in Maryland [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>], not to say any thing of its 
situation, which is extremely bad, will ever be an eyesore to this colony, and attended with more inconveniences than it is possible to enumerate. One instance 
of this I have taken notice of, in a letter that accompanies this, and many more I could recite, were it 
necessary. 
</p><p>
If we take the field, there is not time to carry on a 
work of this kind, but we should immediately set about 
engaging wagons, horses, forage, pack-saddles, &c. 
And here I cannot help remarking, that I believe it will 
be impossible to get wagons or horses sufficient, unless 
the old score is paid off; as the people are really ruined 
for want of their money, and complain justly of their 
grievances. 
</p><p>
I represented in my last the inconveniences of the 
late act of Assembly, which obliges us first to send to 
your Honor for a commission to hold general courtsmartial, and then to delay execution until a warrant can 
be had from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. I hope you will take the 
thing into consideration. We have several deserters 
now on hand, whom I have taken by rigorous measures, 
and who should be made examples to others, as this 
practice is continued with greater spirit than ever. 
</p><p>
Unless clothing is soon provided, the men will be unfit 
for any kind of service. And I know of no expedient to 
procure clothes, but by sending to the northward, as 
cloth cannot be had here. I left, among other returns, 
an exact account of the clothing at every place, when I 
was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. I shall not care to lay in provisions for more than a thousand men, unless I have 
your orders. We have put out such of the beeves as 
were unfit for slaughtering. If they survive the winter, 
they may be useful in the summer. 
</p><p>
Ensign Poison has received a commission in Colonel Gage's regiment, and has thus left a vacancy, which, 
with your approbation, will be filled by Mr. Dennis M c Carty, whom you once appointed a captain. He has 
continued a volunteer ever since, and has recruited several men. I hope your Honor will allow me the liberty, 
as you once promised, of filling up the vacancies, as they happen, with the volunteers, who serve with that 
expectation. We have several with us, who appear to be very deserving young gentlemen. I shall observe 
the strictest justice hi promoting them according to their merit, and their time of entering the service. 
</p><p>
The skipper of the vessels has embezzled some of the stores ; but for want of a particular invoice of them, 
we cannot ascertain the loss. He is kept in confinement until your Honor's pleasure is known. I am, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
When I was down, the Committee among other things 
resolved, that the Maryland and Carolina companies 
should not be supported with our provisions. This resolve, I think, met with your approbation ; upon which 
I wrote to Colonel Stephen, desiring him to acquaint 
Captain Dagworthy therewith, who paid slight regard to 
it, saying they were in the King's garrison, and all the 
troops had an equal right to draw provisions with us, by 
his order, as commanding officer, and that we, after the 
provisions were put there, had no power to remove 
them without his leave. I would, therefore, request 
your Honor's peremptory orders what to do in this case, 
as I do not care to act without instructions, lest it should 
appear to proceed from pique and resentment at having 
the command disputed. This is one among the numberless inconveniences of the fort being in Maryland. 
Captain Dagworthy, I dare venture to affirm, is encouraged to say this by Governor Sharpe, who we know 
has written him to keep the command. With this Captain Dagworthy himself acquainted Colonel Stephen. 
</p><p>
As I have not yet heard how General Shirley has 
answered your request, I fear for the success of it, especially as it is next to an impossibility (since Governor 
Sharpe has been there to plead Captain Dagworthy's 
cause) to make the General acquainted, by writing, with 
the nature of the dispute. The officers have drawn up a 
memorial to be presented to the General, and, that it 
may be properly strengthened, they humbly beg your 
solicitation to have us put upon the establishment, as we 
have certain advices that it is in his power. This would 
at once put an end to contention, which is the root 
of evil, and destructive to the best operations ; and it 
w r ould turn all our movements into a free and easy 
channel. 
</p><p>
They have urged it to me, in the warmest manner, 
to appear personally before the General for that end. 
This I would gladly do, even at this disagreeableseason, 
if I had your permission ; which I the more freely ask, 
since I am determined to resign a commission, which 
you were generously pleased to offer me, and for which 
I shall always retain a grateful sense, rather than submit 
to the command of a person, who has not such superlative merit as to balance the inequality of rank. However, he adheres to what he calls his rights, in which 
I know he is supported by Governor Sharpe. He says, 
that he has no commission from the province of Maryland, but acts by virtue of that from the King ; that this 
was the condition of his engaging in the Maryland service; and that, when he was sent up there the 1st of 
last October, he was ordered by Governor Sharpe and 
Sir John St. Clair not to give up his right. To my 
certain knowledge his rank was disputed before General 
Braddock, who gave it in his favor ; and he accordingly 
took place of every captain upon the expedition, except 
Captain James Mercer and Captain Rutherford, whose 
commissions were older than his ; so that I should not 
by any means choose to act, as your Honor hinted in 
your last, lest I should be called to an account myself.  
</p><p>
I have, during my stay at Winchester from the 20th 
of December to this time, disposed of all the men and 
officers, that are not recruiting, and can be spared from 
the fort, in the best manner I could for the defence of 
the inhabitants, and they will need no further orders till 
I could return. And the recruiting officers are allowed 
till the 1st of March to repair to their rendezvous, which 
leaves at present nothing to do at the fort, but to train 
and discipline the men, and prepare and salt the provisions. For the better perfecting both these, I have 
left full and clear directions. 
</p><p>
Besides, in other respects, I think my going to the 
northward might be of service, as I should thereby become acquainted with the plan of operations, so far as it 
may be thought proper to be communicated. 
</p><p>
Should you comply with my request, I would thank 
you for such letters, as you think may enforce the petition to the General, or any of the governors in my way. 
I am, &c.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Looking upon our affairs at this critical juncture to be 
of such importance, and having a personal acquaintance 
with General Shirley, which I thought might add some 
weight to the strength of our memorial, I solicited leave, 
which is obtained, to visit him in person. I shall accordingly set out in two days for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, having procured letters from the Governor. You may depend I 
shall leave no stone unturned for this salutary end ; and, 
I think, if reason, justice, and every equitable right can 
claim attention, we deserve to be heard. 
</p><p>
As I have taken the fatigue of this tedious journey 
upon myself, which I had never thought of until I left 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, I hope you will conduct every thing in my 
absence for the interest and honor of the service. And 
I must exhort you in the most earnest manner to strict 
discipline and due exercise of arms. 
</p><p>
You may tell Mr. Livingston from me, that, if the 
soldiers are not skilled in arms equal to what may reasonably be expected, he most assuredly shall answer 
for it at my return. And I must frankly tell you, that I 
also expect to find them expert at bush-fighting. You 
are to order a particular account to be taken of the provisions, that are delivered to the Maryland and Carolina 
companies by the commissary. 
</p><p>
The Governor seems determined to make the officers 
comply with the terms of holding their commissions, or 
forfeit them. He approves of Dekeyser's suspension, 
and orders, that he shall not be admitted into the camp. 
He seems uneasy at what I own gives me much concern, namely, that gaming is introduced into the camp. 
</p><p>
I am ordered to discourage it, and must desire that you 
will intimate the same. 
</p><p>
As money may be wanted for paying the troops, and 
other incidental charges, order the paymaster down to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, where he may receive of Mr. Kirkpatrick 
the sum requisite.

I think of nothing else at present ; so, with once more

I can but return my very hearty thanks for your kind 
condescension in suffering me to wait upon General 
Shirley, as I am very well assured it was done with the 
intention to favor my suit. 
</p><p>
There is as yet an unanswerable argument against our 
taking the field, which I forgot to mention in my last; 
that is, the want of a train of artillery, and, what is full 
as necessary, engineers to conduct the affair, if we hope 
to approach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
By the advices, which we have received hitherto from 
the northward, the Pennsylvanians are determined to 
act defensively. For that purpose they have posted 
their newly raised levies upon their frontiers at different 
passes, and have received the additional strength and 
favor of a detachment or two from the regulars. 
</p><p>
I have ordered, besides the forts that are built, and 
now building, that a road which I had reconnoitred, 
and which proves nearer and better, should be immediately opened for the more easy transportation of stores 
from Winchester to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> ; so there is not 
the least fear that the soldiers will be corrupted through idleness. 
</p><p>
The commission for calling general courts -martial appears to me imperfect, notwithstanding it was drawn by 
the attorney-general, as it rather, by the words, appoints 
me, or whomever it is directed to, president of the said 
court, than invests a power to hold a court-martial without its being first ordered by you ; whereas, the commission should empower the officer to appoint a court, 
of which he is to be president. But as I hope there 
will be little occasion for any, until I come back, it may 
be deferred until then, when that and other things, I 
trust, will be properly settled. 
</p><p>
I have always, so far as was in my power, endeavoured to discourage gaming in the camp ; and always 
shall while I have the honor to preside there. 
</p><p>
I have delivered the skipper to Mr. Carlyle, who proposes, in order to save expense, to send him round by 
water, in the vessel that brought up the stores. The 
evidences in this affair will be Mr. Carlyle, Ensigns 
Buckner and Deane, and one of the men now in the 
vessel. 
</p><p>
I cannot help observing, that your Honor, if you have 
not seen the clothes lately sent up, has been imposed 
upon by the contractors, for they are really unfit for use; 
or, at least, will soon be so. 
</p><p>
I have nothing in particular to add, but to assure you, 
that I shall use my utmost diligence in the prosecution 
of my journey and pretensions, and that I am, with very 
great esteem, your Honor's, &c.  .

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday, and think it advisable to 
despatch an express (notwithstanding I hear two or three are already sent down) to inform you of the unhappy situation of affairs in this quarter. The enemy 
have returned in greater numbers, committed several murders not far from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and even are so daring as to attack our forts in open day, as you may see 
by the enclosed letters and papers. Many of the inhabitants are in a miserable situation by their losses, and 
so apprehensive of danger, that, I believe, unless a stop 
is put to the depredations of the Indians, the Blue Ridge 
will soon become our frontier. 
</p><p>
I find it impossible to continue on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, until a body of men can be raised. I have advised 
with Lord Fairfax, and other officers of the militia, who 
have ordered each captain to call a private muster, and 
to read the exhortation enclosed (for orders are no 
longer regarded in this county), in hopes that this expedient may meet with the desired success. If it should, 
I shall, with such men as are ordered from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> to join these, scour the woods and suspected 
places, in all the mountains and valleys, on this part of 
our frontiers ; and doubt not but I shall fall in with the 
Indians and their more cruel associates. I hope the 
present emergency of affairs, assisted by such good 
news as the Assembly may by this time have received 
from England, and from the Commissioners, will determine them to take vigorous measures for their own and 
country's safety, and no longer depend on an uncertain 
way of raising men for their own protection. However 
absurd it may appear, it is nevertheless certain, that five 
hundred Indians have it more in their power to annoy 
the inhabitants, than ten times their number of regulars. 
Besides the advantageous way they have of fighting 
in the woods, their cunning and craft, their activity 
and patient sufferings, are not to be equalled. They 
prowl about like wolves, and, like them, do their mischief by stealth. They depend upon their dexterity in 
hunting and upon the cattle of the inhabitants for provisions. For these reasons, I own, I do not think it 
unworthy of the notice of the legislature to compel the 
inhabitants (if a general war is likely to ensue, and 
things are to continue in this unhappy situation for any 
time,) to live in townships, working at each other's farms 
by turns, and to drive their cattle into the thickly settled 
parts of the country. Were this done, they could not 
be cut off by small parties, and large ones could not 
subsist without provisions. 
</p><p>
It seemed to be the sentiment of the House of Burgesses when I was down, that a chain of forts should 
be erected upon our frontiers, for the defence of the 
people. This expedient, in my opinion, without an inconceivable number of men, will never answer their 
expectations. 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor has had a particular account of Major Lewis's unsuccessful attempt to get to 
the Shawanese Town. It was an expedition, from 
which, on account of the length of the march, I always 
had little hope, and often expressed my uneasy apprehensions on that head. But since they are returned, 
with the Indians that accompanied them, I think it 
would be a very happy step to prevail upon the latter 
to proceed as far as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. It is in their power to be of infinite use to us ; and without Indians, 
we shall never be able to cope with those cruel foes to our country.
</p><p>
I would therefore beg leave to recommend in a very earnest manner, that your Honor would send an express 
to them immediately for this desirable end. I should 
have done it myself, but was uncertain whether it might 
prove agreeable or not. I also hope you will order 
Major Lewis to secure his guides, as I understand he attributes all his misfortunes to their misconduct. Such 
offences should meet with adequate punishment, or else 
we may ever be misled by designing villains. I am 
your Honor's, &c. 
</p><p>
P. S. Since writing the above, Mr. Paris, who commanded a party, is returned. He relates, that, upon the 
North River, he fell in with a small body of Indians whom 
he engaged, and, after a contest of half an hour, put 
them to flight. Monsieur Donville, commander of the 
party, was killed and scalped, and his instructions found 
about him, which I enclose. We had one man killed, 
and two wounded. Mr. Paris sent the scalp by Jenkins; 
and I hope, although it is not an Indian's, they will meet 
with an adequate reward. The whole party jointly 
claim the reward, no person pretending solely to assume 
the merit. 
</p><p>
Your Honor may in some measure penetrate into the 
daring designs of the French by their instructions, in 
which orders are given to burn, if possible, our magazine 
at Conococheague, a place that is in the midst of a 
thickly settled country. 
</p><p>
I have ordered the party there to be made as strong 
as time and our present circumstances will permit, lest 
they should attempt to execute the instructions of 
Dumas.  I have also ordered up an officer and twenty 
recruits to assist Joseph Edwards, and the 'people on 
those waters. The inhabitants of this town are under 
dreadful apprehensions of an attack, and all the roads 
between this and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> are much infested. 
As I apprehend you will be obliged to draft men, I hope 
care will be taken, that none shall be chosen but active, 
resolute men, who are practised in the use of arms, and are marksmen.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It gave me infinite concern to find in yours by Governor Innes, that any representations should inflame the 
Assembly against the Virginia regiment, or give cause 
to suspect the morality and good behaviour of the officers. How far any of the individuals may have deserved 
such reflections, I will not take upon me to determine, 
but this I am certain of, and can call my conscience, and 
what, I suppose, will be a still more demonstrative proof 
in the eyes of the world, my orders, to witness how 
much I have, both by threats and persuasive means, endeavoured to discountenance gaming, drinking, swearing, 
and irregularities of every other kind ; while I have, on 
the other hand, practised every artifice to inspire a laudable emulation in the officers for the service of their 
country, and to encourage the soldiers in the unerring 
exercise of their duty. How far I have failed in this 
desirable end, I cannot pretend to say. But it is nevertheless a point, which does in my opinion merit some 
scrutiny, before it meets with a final condemnation. 
Yet I will not undertake to vouch for the conduct of 
many of the officers, as I know there are some, who 
have the seeds of idleness very strongly implanted in 
their natures ; and I also know, that the unhappy difference about the command, which has kept me from Fort 
Cumberland, has consequently prevented me from enforcing the orders, which I never failed to send. 
</p><p>
However, if I continue in the service, I shall take care 
to act with a little more rigor, than has hitherto been 
practised, since I find it so necessary. 
</p><p>
I wrote your Honor in my last how unsuccessfully we 
attempted to raise the militia, and that I was reduced to the necessity of waiting here for the arrival of an escort 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. The garrison there is barely manned. The rest are out on parties ; yet the Indians 
continue to haunt the roads, and pick up straggling persons. This you may see by the enclosed from Captain 
John Mercer, who, being out with a scouting party of one hundred men, has been ordered to search the 
Warm- Spring Mountain, where, it is lately reported, the Indians rendezvous. The commission you have sent 
for holding courts -martial is yet insufficient, as it is copied, I suppose, too literally after Governor Innes, who 
had no power to hold a general court-martial, or to try commissioned officers. But this may be postponed 
until I come down, which will be in a short time after I arrive at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I am your Honor's, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since writing my letter of yesterday's date, the enclosed came to hand, by which you will be informed of 
a very unlucky affair.
</p><p>
I immediately consulted Governor Innes, and such 
officers of my regiment as were at this place, on the 
necessary steps to be taken. They unanimously advised, that I should remain here with the fifty recruits 
that are in town, for the defence of the place, until the 
militia be raised, that we may thereby be enabled to 
compose a formidable body, and march out against the enemy. 
</p><p>
This engagement happened within twenty miles of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and the sergeant, who brought the letter, 
assures me there is reason to imagine, that their numbers are greater than the letter informs. He says there 
were many French among them, and that the chief part 
of the whole were mounted on horseback ; so that there 
is a great probability of their having a design upon this 
place. 
</p><p>
I have sent an express to Lord Fairfax, with a copy 
of Stark's letter, and have desired, in the most earnest 
manner, that he will be expeditious in calling the militia ; 
but, alas ! that is an unhappy dependence ; yet the only 
one we have. I am your Honor's, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This encloses several letters, and the minutes of a 
council of war, which was held upon the receipt of 
them. Your Honor may see to what unhappy straits 
the distressed inhabitants and myself are reduced. I 
am too little acquainted, Sir, with pathetic language to 
attempt a description of the people's distresses, though 
I have a generous soul, sensible of wrongs, and swelling 
for redress. But what can I do ? I see their situation, 
know their danger, and participate their sufferings, without having it in my power to give them further relief, 
than uncertain promises. In short, I see inevitable 
destruction in so clear a light, that, unless vigorous 
measures are taken by the Assembly, and speedy assistance sent from below, the poor inhabitants that are 
now in forts, must unavoidably fall, while the remainder 
are flying before the barbarous foe. In fine, the melancholy situation of the people, the little prospect of 
assistance, the gross and scandalous abuses cast upon 
the officers in general, which is reflecting upon me in 
particular, for suffering misconduct of such extraordinary 
kinds, and the distant prospect, if any, of gaining honor 
and reputation in the service, cause me to lament the 
hour, that gave me a commission, and would induce me, 
at any other time than this of imminent danger, to resign, without one hesitating moment, a command, from 
which I never expect to reap either honor or benefit ; 
but, on the contrary, have almost an absolute certainty 
of incurring displeasure below, while the murder of 
helpless families may be laid to my account here ! 
</p><p>
The supplicating tears of the women, and moving petitions of the men, melt me into such deadly sorrow, 
that I solemnly declare, if I know my own mind, I could 
offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy, 
provided that would contribute to the people's ease. 
</p><p>
Lord Fairfax has ordered men from the adjacent 
counties, but when they will come, or in what numbers, 
I cannot pretend to determine. If I may judge from 
the success we have met with here, I have but little 
hope, as three days' incessant endeavours have produced but twenty men. 
</p><p>
I have too often urged my opinion for vigorous measures, and shall only add, that, besides the accounts you 
will receive in the letters, we are told from all parts, that 
the woods appear to be alive with Indians, who feast 
upon the fat of the land. As we have not more than a 
barrel or two of powder at this place, the rest being at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I could wish that some might be sent 
up. I have written to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a>, 
desiring that two barrels may be sent from each place, 
but whether there is any at either, I know not. I have 
sent orders to Captain Harrison to be diligent on the waters where he is posted, and to use his utmost endeavours to protect the people; and, if possible, to 
surprise the enemy at their sleeping-places. Ashby's 
letter is a very extraordinary one. The design of the 
Indians was only, in my opinion, to intimidate him into 
a surrender. For which reason I have written him 
word, that if they do attack him, he must defend that 
place to the last extremity, and when bereft of hope, 
lay a train to blow up the fort, and retire by night to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
A small fort, which we have at the mouth of Patterson's Creek, containing an officer and thirty men guarding 
stores, was attacked smartly by the French and Indians ; 
they were as warmly received, upon which they retired. 
Our men at present are dispersed in small bodies, 
guarding the people and public stores.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Not an hour, nay scarcely a minute, passes, that doe 
not produce fresh alarms and melancholy accounts. 
Nor is it possible to give the people the necessary assistance for their defence, on account of the small number of men we have, or that are likely to be here for 
some time. The inhabitants are removing daily, and in 
a short time will leave this country as desolate as 
Hampshire, where scarce a family lives. 
</p><p>
Three families were murdered the night before last, 
at the distance of less than twelve miles from this place ; 
and every day we have accounts of such cruelties and 
barbarities, as are shocking to human nature. It is not 
possible to conceive the situation and danger of this 
miserable country. Such numbers of French and Indians are all around, that no road is safe ; and here we 
know not the hour when we may be attacked. 
</p><p>
As it is not in my power to give you a full account of 
every thing, I have sent Captain Peachey to wait upon 
you, who can be more ample and satisfactory in every 
point, that requires your notice. I have written for the 
militia of Fairfax, Prince William, and Culpeper, and 
expect them here in a very few days. But how they 
are to be supplied with ammunition and provisions, I am 
quite at a loss to know. The distance of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> from us, where these supplies are, renders them 
useless, in a manner, and puts us to the greatest straits ; 
and as the inhabitants are leaving their farms, it will be 
impossible for the militia to subsist without a supply of 
provisions, which are now very scarce, and will be more 
so. I should therefore be glad if your Honor would 
send up arms, ammunition, and provisions, and give immediate orders for the Irish beef at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, which 
cannot be had without your consent. 
</p><p>
You spoke of sending some Indians to our assistance, 
in which no time should be lost, nor any means omitted 
to engage all the Catawbas and Cherokees, that can 
possibly be gathered, and immediately to despatch them 
hither. Unless we have Indians to oppose Indians, we 
may expect but small success. And I should think it 
no bad scheme, while the Indians remain here in such 
numbers, to have a detachment sent out with some 
friendly Indians to make an attempt upon the hostile 
towns, though this should be executed with all imaginable secrecy. 
</p><p>
I hear the Assembly is for augmenting the forces in 
pay to fifteen hundred only, which are far too few to 
defend the frontiers against so numerous an enemy. 
But I have often written you my sentiments upon this 
and other subjects, and shall not now enlarge. I have 
also written to the Speaker by Captain Peachey, who 
will, I imagine, communicate to you what demands your 
immediate regard. 
</p><p>
I wish your Honor would inform me, whether the 
militia expected here must be supplied out of the public 
stock of provisions laid up for the soldiers, or are to 
supply themselves. The want of due direction in matters of this nature causes great inconvenience. Give 
me leave to urge your speedy care in sending men and 
ammunition to our assistance, else the consequence may 
prove very fatal in a little time. 
</p><p>
I have been just now told, that numbers about the 
neighbourhood hold councils and cabals for very dishonorable purposes, and unworthy the thoughts of a 
British subject. Despairing of assistance and protection 
from below (as they foolishly conjecture), they talk of 
capitulating and agreeing upon terms with the French and Indians, rather than lose their lives and fortunes 
through obstinacy. My force, at present, is very weak, 
and unable to take the necessary measures, as to those 
suspected persons ; but, as soon as the militia arrive, be 
assured I will do my utmost to detect and secure such 
pests of society, if my information is not groundless, 
which I should be pleased to find so. 
</p><p>
I enclose a copy of a council of war lately held here, 
and copies of some letters received since my last to you ; 
one of which, for Colonel Martin, has been just sent to 
me from Fort Hopewell, on the South Branch. They 
have had an engagement there, with the French and 
Indians, the particulars of which you will see by the enclosed. Captain Waggener, with a party of his men, 
joined them the next day, and went in pursuit of the 
enemy, but could not come up with them. The waters 
were so high, that although Captain Waggener heard 
them engaged, he could send them no assistance. From 
these and other circumstances, you may form but a 
faint idea of the wretched situation of this country, nor 
can it be adequately conceived.

My extreme hurry, confusion, and anxiety must plead 
an excuse for incorrectness. I am your Honor's, &,c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I received yours by Mr. Kirkpatrick, and 
am sorry to hear of the reflections upon the conduct of 
the officers. I could wish that their names had been 
particularized, that justice might be done to the innocent and guilty ; for it is extremely hard, that the whole 
corps should suffer reproaches for the inadvertence and 
misconduct of a few.
</p><p>
The deplorable situation of this people is no more to 
be described, than my anxiety and uneasiness for their 
relief. You may expect, by the time this comes to 
hand, that, without a considerable reinforcement, Frederic county will not be mistress of fifteen families. 
They are now retreating to the securest parts in droves 
of fifties. In short, every thing has too melancholy an 
appearance for pen to communicate. I have therefore 
sent an officer, whose good sense and judicious observations will be a more effectual way of transmitting an 
account of the people's distresses. 
</p><p>
I wish the Assembly had given two thousand, instead 
of fifteen hundred men, and that I had been acquainted 
with the dispositions they intended to make. Since I 
am ignorant of these, I hope it will not be thought presuming in me to offer my sentiments upon the subject. 
</p><p>
We are, Sir, first to consider, that, if a chain of forts is to be erected upon our frontiers, it will be done with 
a design to protect the people ; therefore, if these forts are more than fifteen or eighteen miles, or a day's march, 
asunder, and garrisoned with less than eighty or a hundred men each, the object is not answered, and for these 
reasons. First, if they are at greater distances, it will 
be inconvenient for the soldiers to scout, and will allow 
the enemy to pass between undiscovered. Secondly if 
they are garrisoned with less than eighty or a hundred 
men, the number will be too few to afford detachments. 
Then, again, our frontiers are so extensive, that, were 
the enemy to attack us on the one side, they might, before the troops on the other could reach the spot, overrun and destroy half the country. And it is mere than 
probable, if they had a design in one direction, they 
would make a feint in another. We are also to consider 
what sums the building of twenty forts, and the removing of stores and provisions to each, would cost. In the 
last place, we are to inquire where and when this expense will end. For, unless we endeavour to remove 
the cause, we shall be liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now, if the war continues, and the 
enemy is allowed to remain on the Ohio. 
</p><p>
I shall next give the reasons, which I think make for 
a defensive plan. If the neighbouring colonies refuse 
us their assistance, we have neither strength nor ability 
to conduct an expedition ; and, if we had, and were the 
whole to join us, I do not see to what purpose, since we 
have neither a train of artillery, artillery -men, nor engineers to execute any scheme beyond the mountains 
against a regular fortress. Again, we have neither 
stores nor provisions, arms nor ammunition, wagons nor 
horses, in any degree proportioned to the service ; and 
to undertake an affair, where we are sure to fall through, 
would be productive of the worst consequences. By 
another defeat we should entirely lose the interest of every Indian. 
</p><p>
If, then, we cannot act offensively with a prospect of 
success, we must be upon the defensive ; and that there 
is no way to protect the people, or save ourselves, but 
by a chain of forts, is certain. 
</p><p>
I would beg leave, in that case, to propose that a 
strong fort should be erected at this place, for a general 
receptacle of all the stores, and a place of residence for 
the commanding officers, which may be garrisoned by 
one company for the security of the stores, serving also 
as escorts for wagons, that are going higher up. It is 
the most public and convenient post for intelligence of 
any in the country, and approaches nearest to the parts, 
that will ever be attacked by numbers. 
</p><p>
I have found by experience, that being just within 
the inhabitants is essential, in giving orders for the defence of the people ; and that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is of no 
more use towards that defence, than Fort George at 
Hampton. For the people, as soon as they are alarmed, 
immediately fly inwards, and at this time there is not an 
inhabitant living between this place and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, except a few settlements upon the Manor around 
a fort we built there, and a few families at Edwards's, on 
Cacapehon River, with a guard of ours, which makes 
this very town at present the outermost frontier. Though 
a place trifling in itself, it is yet of the utmost importance, as it commands the communication from east to 
west, and from nortfy to south. At this place almost 
all the roads centre. It secures the great roads from 
one half our frontiers to the markets of the neighbouring 
colonies, as well as to those on Rappahannoc and Potomac. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> I would have one company 
garrisoned to secure the place, to procure the earliest 
intelligence, and to cover the detachments that may be 
sent towards the Ohio, which is all the use it can ever 
be put to. In the next place, I would propose, that a good fort should be erected between this and Fort 
Cumberland, in a line with the chain of forts across the 
country, and garrisoned by two companies. This I 
would advise, because, as I before observed, if we are 
ever attacked by a large body, it must be here, since 
there is no other road to our frontiers, either for transporting men or necessaries. 
</p><p>
These three forts will employ four companies, which 
will be a tolerable body, if the companies are large, as 
they would be, according to the plan I sent you. And 
it would be a trifling expense to augment each company 
to one hundred privates, making two thousand, exclusive of officers, who were included in the scheme last 
sent. 
</p><p>
After this is done, I would post the remaining companies equidistant, or at proper passes, along our frontiers, agreeably to the enclosed sketch, and order 
communications to be opened between fort and fort, and 
large detachments to scout and discover the tracks of 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
It needs now only to be inquired, upon what part of our 
frontiers these forts are to be built. The Great Ridge, 
or North Mountain, so called in Evans's map, to which 
I refer, is now become our exterior bound, there not 
being one inhabitant beyond, on all the Potomac waters, 
except a few families on the South Branch, and at 
Joseph Edwards's, on Cacapehon, as already mentioned. 
So that it requires some consideration to determine 
whether we are to build near this place, with a view to 
protect the present inhabitants ; or on the South Branch> 
or at Patterson's Creek, in the hope of drawing back 
those, who have forsaken their dwellings. 
</p><p>
If we do not build there, that country will ever want 
settlers ; and if we do, there is so great a blank, with 
such a series of mountains between, that it will be next to impossible to guard the people effectually. I could 
again wish, that the Assembly had given two thousand 
men, exclusive of officers, to be formed into two battalions of ten companies each. Indeed, fifteen hundred 
men are a greater number than ever was in a regiment 
of only one battalion, and they should be divided into 
two, with four field-officers, who should be so posted as 
to have the immediate care of a certain number of forts, 
with orders to draw from one to another, as occasion 
should require.
</p><p>
I could add more on this subject, but I am so hurried, 
that I am obliged to refer you for further particulars to 
the bearer, who will tell you, that, to carry on all these 
works, a number of tools, as well as many other necessaries, will be wanting. 
</p><p>
I have given my opinion with candor, and submit to 
correction with the greatest pleasure. Confusion and 
hurry must be an apology for the incoherence and 
incorrectness of this letter.

I am, dear Sir, yours, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I sent an express to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> on Tuesday 
last, who is just returned with the enclosed letters, 
which I forward, to prevent the trouble of extracting a 
part. 
</p><p>
In my letter to Colonel Stephen, I informed him, 
among other things, of the accusations laid to his charge, 
and that he must expect to have, the matter inquired 
into. You will see what he says upon the subject. 
</p><p>
Desolation and murder still increase, and no prospects 
of relief. The Blue Ridge is now our frontier, no men 
being left in this county, except a few that keep close 
with a number of women and children in forts, which 
they have erected for that purpose. There are now no 
militia in this county. When there were, they could 
not be brought to action. If the inhabitants of the adjacent counties pursue the same system of disobedience, 
the whole must fall an inevitable sacrifice ; and there is 
room to fear, that they have caught the infection, as I 
have sent, besides divers letters to Lord Fairfax, express after express to hurry them on, and yet I have no 
tidings of their march. We have the greatest reason to 
believe, that the number of the enemy is very considerable, as they are spread all over this part of the country ; 
and that their success, and the spoils with which they have enriched themselves, dished up with a good deal 
of French policy, will encourage the Indians of distant 
nations to fall upon our inhabitants in greater numbers, 
and, if possible, with greater rapidity. They enjoy the 
sweets of a profitable war, and will no doubt improve 
the success, which must ever attend their arms, unless 
we have Indians to oppose theirs. I would therefore 
advise, as I often have done, that there should be neither 
trouble nor expense omitted to bring the few, who are 
still inclined, into our service, and that, too, with the 
greatest care and expedition. A small number, just to 
point out the wiles and tracks of the enemy, is better 
than none ; for which reason I must earnestly recommend, that those, who accompanied Major Lewis, 
should be immediately sent up, and such of the Catawbas as can be engaged in our interest. If such another 
torrent as this has been, (or may be ere it is done,) 
should press upon our settlements, there will not be a 
living creature left in Frederic county ; and how soon 
Fairfax and Prince William may share its fate is easily 
conceived, if we only consider a cruel and bloodthirsty 
enemy, conquerors already possessed of the finest part 
of Virginia, plenteously filled with all kinds of provisions, pursuing a people overcome with fear and consternation at the inhuman murders of these barbarous 
savages. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants, who are now in forts, are greatly distressed for the want of ammunition and provision, and 
are incessantly importuning me for both; neither of 
which have I at this place to spare. And if I had, I 
should be much embarrassed to know how to act, as I 
could not be safe in delivering them without your orders ; but to hear the cries of the hungry, who have fled 
for refuge to these places, with nothing more than they 
carried on their backs, is exceedingly moving. I hope, therefore, that you will give directions concerning this matter. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Assembly, setting forth the 
great necessity of erecting a large and strong fort at this 
place, to serve as a receptacle for all our stores, and a 
place of refuge for the women and children in times of 
danger. Were this work completed, the men would 
upon any alarm, as they say themselves, immediately 
lodge their families here, and turn out against the enemy. 
But without some such place of defence, they must 
always fly in the manner they have done, in order to 
secure their wives and children. 
</p><p>
This is the place generally fixed upon, as it has a free 
and open communication with all the country, from its 
peculiar situation. It also secures the communication 
with the neighbouring colonies, and is conveniently situated for procuring intelligence. This is now fully proved 
by the experience I have had since I came here. From 
the time the first murders were committed by the Indians, I have never missed of receiving intelligence of 
their motions, while Colonel Stephen has, in a manner, 
lived in total ignorance. The reason is obvious. Fort 
Cumberland is detached so far beyond the inhabitants, 
that no person thinks of alarming it, but immediately, 
upon the first fright, they retire within the settlements. 
</p><p>
You will observe some parts of Colonel Stephen's letters, about reinforcements from the second division, and 
the number of men, which were only meant as a finesse, 
in case they should fall into the enemy's hands. The 
letters, conveying the true accounts, were put into the 
pummel of the saddle, as were mine to him. 
</p><p>
I have been formerly, and am at present, pretty full 
in offering my opinion and counsel upon matters, which 
regard the public safety and interest. These have been 
solely the object of all my thoughts, words, and actions ; 
and, in order to avoid censure in every part of my conduct, I make it a rule to obey the dictates of your Honor, 
the Assembly, and a good conscience. 
</p><p>
I shall not hereafter trouble you further on these topics, as I can add nothing to what I have said. 
</p><p>
I am your Honor's, &,c.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 3 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have sent down an Indian scalp, which was taken 
at the place where Captain Mercer had his engagement. 
He was found thrust under some rocks, with stones 
piled up against them. They believe more were killed, 
from the quantity of blood found on the ground, and 
from other discoveries of their attempts to make more 
graves. But a hard shower of rain prevented their making a farther search. 
</p><p>
We have reason to believe, that the Indians have returned to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, as some scouts from Fort 
Cumberland saw their tracks that way ; and many corroborating accounts affirm, that the roads over the 
Allegany Mountains are as much beaten, as they were 
last year by General Braddock's army. From these 
and other circumstances we may judge their numbers to 
have been considerable. Whether they are gone for the 
season, or only to bring in a larger party, I am at a loss 
to determine. 
</p><p>
For this reason, and on account of the scarcity of 
provisions on this side of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I must beg 
leave humbly to offer it to your Honor's superior judgment, if it would not be advisable to stop all the militia, 
that are ordered from the ten counties, save about five 
or six hundred from the adjacent ones. These will 
serve to cover our frontiers in this quarter, (which is the 
only part that ever will or can be much exposed,) until 
the regiment is completed by drafts, and until they can 
erect fortresses. Drafts, if they are judiciously chosen, 
will be of infinitely more service, and much less expensive to the country, and they can be immediately sent 
to their posts. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that, if your Honor has a mind to 
stop any part of the militia, you will have full time, notwithstanding they are ordered to rendezvous at this 
place on the 10th instant. I never yet knew any to appear within ten days of the time they were expected ; 
and I am also apprehensive, that having so many of the 
militia out will be the means of retarding the drafts, 
which, above all things, I wish to see completed. 
</p><p>
Though I have often troubled you on this head, I 
must again beg leave to desire your particular instructions and information, as, being in a state of uncertainty, 
without knowing the plan of operations, or what scheme 
to go upon, I am much embarrassed, and left to guess at 
every thing. Orders, that are essential one day, appear 
the next as necessary to be countermanded ; so that I 
really cannot tell how to act for the good of the service, 
or the satisfaction of any individual. Were the regiment complete, and things put on a proper footing, the 
whole would go on smoothly and regularly, which is 
now rendered impossible. So much am I kept in the 
dark, that I do not know whether to prepare for the offensive or defensive ; yet, what might be absolutely 
necessary in the one, would be quite useless in the 
other. 
</p><p>
Great inconveniences arise from our being so dispersed through the country. The men cannot be regularly paid or supplied. If every company had its 
post assigned, their pay might be sent to them, and necessaries always provided in due season. We could 
also have the same advantages were we collected into one place. But there are now so many detachments 
out, that one officer may command men of every company of the regiment, and when necessaries are sent, he 
may be removed from his command, and those things cannot be stopped out of their pay. By this method 
the country loses money, the men are badly supplied, and always discontented. 
</p><p>
I find the act of Assembly against mutiny and desertion quite insufficient, except in those two particular 
crimes. No court-martial can be held, by virtue of this 
act, for trying any officer or soldier charged with cowardice, holding correspondence with the enemy, quitting 
or sleeping upon his post, nay, many other crimes, 
which are provided against in the articles of war. I 
think, at this time, it would be for the good of the service to make an act to enforce the articles of war in 
general, except two or three particular ones, such as impressing wagons, and the like. They are in force in our 
mother country, where they are thought best calculated 
for keeping soldiers under discipline ; and none of them 
would prove burthensome, or inconvenient, either to the 
public or any individual. 
</p><p>
About one hundred and fifty of the Fairfax militia are now in town. Three hundred are expected from Prince 
William. With the soldiers and militia now here, I intend to go out and scour the woods hereabouts for three 
or four days until the others arrive. 
</p><p>
Clothes for the men are very much wanted. We have none in store, and some men, who have been enlisted these two months, and to whom we could give 
nothing but a blanket, shoes, and shirt, are justly dissatisfied at having two pence per day stopped from their 
wages. Provision here is scarce, and the commissary 
much wanted to lay in more. I have been, and still am, 
obliged to do this duty, as well as most others, which I 
would take upon me, rather than let any thing in my 
power be wanted for the good of the country. 
</p><p>
I enclose your Honor the sentence of a general courtmartial, which was held here upon a sergeant for running 
away with his party. They have, I think, very justly 
adjudged him to suffer death, which sentence I hope 
you will approve, as there never was a fitter object to 
make an example of, this being the second time he has 
been guilty of the same crime. I am your Honor's, &c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I doubt not but your Honor will be as much surprised, 
as I have been concerned and vexed, at my stay here. 
</p><p>
When I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, I did it with a design to 
proceed with the utmost expedition to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fredericksburg" rel="city">Fredericksburg</a> to dinner, the day 
after I left your Honor, at one o'clock, and gave the 
officer, posted at that place, a List of such tools as were 
wanted to build the chain of forts, and ordered them to 
be sent by a wagon, pressed for that purpose, immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, to which place I repaired to get 
every thing in readiness, and wait their coming to escort 
them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I thought it needless to 
proceed without them, as nothing can be done for want 
of tools. I have sent two or three expresses to hurry 
them on, and shall make no delay when they arrive. 
I intend to take the advice of a council of war, when I 
arrive at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, as to the line on which these 
forts are to be erected, and shall visit all the grounds 
that I conveniently can, and direct the building. 
</p><p>
It is a work, that must be conducted tediously for 
these reasons, namely, the scarcity of tools, the smallness of our numbers, and the want of conductors. 
</p><p>
The strength of our forces will not admit of many 
divisions, because, in that case, each party may probably 
be diminished. We can, therefore, only attempt, with 
such men as can be drawn out of the garrisons already 
established, to build fort after fort, and not, by attempting 
too many at a time, thereby run the risk of having the 
whole demolished. To go on in the manner above 
mentioned must be extremely tedious, unless you will 
be pleased to put the militia upon our southern frontiers 
under the command of Captain Hogg, and order them 
to begin on the Mayo River, and proceed in their building until they meet our parties, who will advance southward. I can point out no other method at present to 
expedite this necessary work. 
</p><p>
If you approve this scheme, and will let me know it 
by an express, I shall despatch another with the information to Captain Hogg, and enclose to him such a plan, 
as the whole will be directed by. Your orders to the 
militia, and indeed to the inhabitants of these parts, to 
assist with their advice in fixing upon the places, and 
with their labor in forwarding the work, are absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
Your Honor never gave me a decisive answer to a 
question I asked, about assigning companies to the fieldofficers. For this reason I have presumed to repeat it 
again, because there are two companies now vacant, by 
the death of .Captain John Mercer, and the resignation 
of Captain Savage, and they should either be given to 
field-officers, or to the oldest lieutenants. No advantage can possibly arise to the field-officers from having 
companies, since they are allowed, I suppose, the same 
pay now, as they would receive in such a case. 
</p><p>
Two hundred and forty -six drafts are the total 
number brought in. Of these several have deserted. 
Three were discharged, being quite unfit for service, 
(and indeed several more ought to be discharged, if men 
were not so scarce,) and there remain now in confinement six Quakers, who will neither bear arms, work, 
receive provisions or pay, nor do any thing that tends, in 
any respect, to self-defence. I should be glad of your 
directions how to proceed with them. I cannot yet return to you the names of the volunteers, that will be appointed to the vacancies, but as soon as I arrive at Fort 
Cumberland I shall acquaint you according to request. 
</p><p>
Governor Sharpe is building a fort on Potomac River, 
about fifteen miles above Conococheague, which may be 
of great service towards the protection of our people on 
that side. It is thought the fort will cost the province 
of Maryland near thirty thousand pounds, before it is 
finished. I am, &,c.

SIR,

</p><p>
Giving the necessary orders and directions, about the 
chain of forts to be built on the frontiers, has kept me 
so closely employed, that I could not write fully to yoi 
until this time. But I have got that trouble now pretty 
well off my hands, as I have despatched orders, plans, 
and tools to all the officers appointed to that duty. 
</p><p>
By the enclosed proceedings of a council held at Fort 
Cumberland, you will see our determination, and where 
it is necessary to erect the forts. Although we have not 
kept strictly to the act of Assembly, I hope it will be 
overlooked, as I am sensible that this will be the best 
chain that can possibly be erected ior the defence of the 
people, and that the Assembly aimed at that, but, being 
unacquainted with the situation of the country, had fallen into an error.
</p><p>
I make no doubt, that you have ere this heard of the 
defeat of Lieutenant Rutherford of the Rangers, escorting an express to me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and of the 
dastardly behaviour of the militia, who ran off without 
one half of them having discharged their pieces, although they were apprised of the ambuscade by one of 
the flanking parties, before the Indians fired upon them ; 
and ran back to Ashby's Fort, contrary to orders, persuasions, and threats. They are all ordered in, as soon 
as the people have secured their harvest. Those of 
King George and Caroline counties are already here. 
The rest I expect shortly. Through the passive behaviour of their officers they are very refractory. 
</p><p>
expedient or impracticable. Herring's Laws of Virginia, Vol. VII. p. 18. 
The chain was built according to the decisions of the Council. . 
</p><p>
The following extract from the Orderly Book, issued in general orders 
by the Commander two days after he reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, will show 
that he enforced rigid rules of discipline. 
</p><p>
" Colonel Washington has observed, that the men of his regiment aro 
very profane and reprobate. He takes this opportunity to inform them of 
his great displeasure at such practices, and assures them, that, if they do 
not leave them off, they shall be severely punished. The officers are desired, if they hear any man swear, or make use of an oath or execration, 
to order the offender twenty-five lashes immediately, without a courtmartial. For the second offence, he will be more severely punished." 
</p><p>
To a captain he also wrote, about the same time ; " Your suffering 
such clamors among the men argues very great remissness in you. I imagined your being put there over them was partly with an intent to keep 
them quiet and passive, but this express, sent purely to humor them, would 
indicate that you are afraid to do your duty. Let me tell you, in your own 
words, that ' I was very much surprised ' at the contents of your letter, 
written in such a commanding style. And your demands were so express 
and peremptory, that the direction was the only thing, which gave me the 
least room to suspect it could be written to any but John Roe, or some 
other of your menial servants. 
</p><p>
" I am sorry to find your conduct so disagreeable to all the officers, as 
to occasion two, who were appointed to your company, to resign. I must 
therefore desire you will act circumspectly, as I assure you, if I have any 
just complaints made against you, you may expect to answer them." 
</p><p>
This captain was much older in years, than the Commander-in-chief, and 
had probably taken some liberties on that ground.

There is an act of Parliament to allow all servants to 
enlist, and the owners to be paid a reasonable allowance 
for them. If we had this privilege, we could soon complete the regiment; and I doubt not but his Majesty 
would order them to be paid for, if we enlisted them, as 
soon as for the regulars ; nay, should he not, the ten 
pounds' fine through the country would go a considerable way towards it. And this we may depend upoi 
if we have not this liberty granted us, the servants wil 
all run off to the regular officers, who are recruiting 
around us ; and that would be to weaken our colony 
much, when it could receive no immediate benefit from 
it. For my part, I see no other expedient.  
</p><p>
he is to remain at his fort, and act as lieutenant of the Rangers, until further orders. Tell him, also, not to stir from his post at his peril, until he 
has leave ; if he does, I will arrest him for his disobedience of orders, and 
try him as soon as he arrives here.'' 
</p><p>
 The servants mentioned in this paragraph were emigrants from Europe, or persons imported, whose services were purchased for a term of 
years, either from the masters of vessels, who brought them over, or from 
the individuals themselves. By a law of Virginia, all servants, except convicts, imported without indenture, if they were Christians or of Christian 
parentage, and above nineteen years of age, could be required to serve 
only five years ; if under nineteen, their term of service was limited to the 
age of twenty-four. No such person could ever be sold as a slave. 
Hening, Vol. VI. p. 356. These servants were exempt from military duty. 
</p><p>
When Lord Loudoun succeeded Governor Shirley, as commander of the 
forces in America, he was empowered to raise a regiment in the colonies, 
consisting of four battalions, to be commanded by officers bearing the 
King's commission, and called the Royal Jlmerican Regiment. He was 
authorized, also, to enlist servants of the above description, paying to their 
masters a proper compensation for the time they had yet to serve. Recruiting officers were now employed in Virginia, enlisting men for the 
Royal Regiment, and interfered essentially with the enlistments for the 
service of the colony. The Governor endeavoured to prevail on the Assembly to draft militia for this regiment, but without success. They voted 
eight thousand pounds to be paid for enlisting men, and transporting them 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Dinwiddie's Letter-Books. 
</p><p>
The Maryland Assembly appropriated five thousand pounds to aid enlistments in that colony for the Royal Regiment, and resolved to raise three 
hundred men. A bounty was given not exceeding five pounds for each 
man enlisted. A letter was received by the Governor from Henry Fox

You perceive plainly what effect the act of Assembly, 
in regard to the drafts, has had, and how little our 
strength has been augmented by that scheme, and in 
three or four months we shall not be the better for 
them. They are then to be discharged. 
</p><p>
I could wish we were clear of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. It 
takes a great part of our small force to garrison it, and I 
see no service that it renders to our colony ; for since 
the Indians have driven the inhabitants so low down, 
they do not hesitate to follow them as far as Conococheague and this place. There have been several 
families murdered within two miles of the mouth of 
Conococheague, on the Maryland side, this week ; and 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is now so much out of the way, that 
the forces there seldom hear of those things within a 
month after they are done. 
</p><p>
Our men want many necessaries, until the arrival of 
their regimentals, which cannot be had without sending 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; and the great loss, which we shall suffer by sending our paper money for them, has prevented 
my purchasing them, until the men are almost naked. 
</p><p>
I could by no means bring the Quakers to any terms. 
They chose rather to be whipped to death than to bear 
arms, or lend us any assistance whatever upon the fort, 
or any thing for self-defence. Some of their friends

one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, directing that the compensation to masters for enlisted servants should be paid by the colony ; 
but the Assembly refused to comply with this order by a majority of more 
than two to one. See Totes and Proceedings for September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
The " ten pounds' fine" spoken of in the text, was the penalty imposed 
on such of the drafted militia as refused to march. This fine was so low, 
that many of the drafts preferred to pay it, and stay at home. 
</p><p>
Governor Dinwiddie said in reply; "If you can enlist servants agreeably to the act of Parliament, the masters of such servants shall be paid 
for the time they have to serve in proportion to the first purchase, but 1 
think you should be careful not to enlist any convicts, who probably may 
be factious and bad examples to the others."

I observe your proposal to Lord Loudoun of carrying

to stay at home to defend their ow r n possessions. But 
we are quite unprepared for such an undertaking. If it 
is fixed upon, now is the time for buying up provisions, 
and laying them in at the most convenient places. The 
Pennsylvania butchers are buying quantities of beef here, 
which should be put a stop to, if we are to march towards the Ohio. If we are still to remain on the defensive, and garrison the chain of forts, provisions must 
be laid in at each of them ; and I much fear, if we march 
from the frontiers, all the inhabitants will quit their plantations. Your sentiments and orders on this head will 
be very agreeable to me, and shall be punctually complied with. I am, &,c.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 5 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> at present contains all our provisions and valuable stores, and is not capable of an hour's 
defence, if the enemy were only to bring a single halfpounder against it; which they might do with great 
ease on horseback. Besides, it lies so remote from this 
place, as well as from the neighbouring inhabitants, that 
it requires as much force to keep the communication 
open to it, as a fort at the Meadows would do, and employs one hundred and fifty men, who are a dead charge 
to the country, as they can be of no other use than just 
to protect and guard the stores, which might as well be 
lodged at Cox's Fort ;  indeed better, for they would 
then be more contiguous to this place, to the inhabitants, 
and to the enemy, and more serviceable, if we should 
ever carry an expedition over the mountains, by opening 
a road where the Indians have blazed, t A strong garrison there would not only protect the stores, but also 
the few remaining inhabitants on the Branch, t and at the 
same time waylay and annoy the enemy, as they pass 
and repass the mountains. Whereas, the forces at Fort 
Cumberland, lying in a corner quite remote from the inhabited parts, to which the Indians always repair to 
commit their murders, can have no intelligence of any 
thing that is doing, but remain in total ignorance of all 
transactions. When I was down, I applied to the Governor for his particular and positive directions in this affair. The following is an exact copy of his answer. 
" <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> is a King's fort, and built chiefly at 
the charge of the colony, therefore properly under our 
direction, until a governor is appointed." Now whether 
I am to understand this ay or no, to the plain, simpl< 
question asked, " Is the fort to be continued or removed 1" I know not. But in all important matters 
I am directed in this ambiguous and uncertain way. 
</p><p>
Great and inconceivable difficulties arise in the execution of my commands, as well as infinite loss and disrepute to the service, by my not having power to pay 
for deserters. I would, therefore, humbly recommend it 
to the consideration of the Committee, whether it would 
not be more for the interest of the country, were I allowed to pay these demands, rather than have them 
levied in the public claims. Many of our deserters are 
apprehended in Maryland, and some in Pennsylvania, 
and, for the sake of the reward, are brought hither. But 
since they, who apprehend them, are to receive certificates only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds 
of tobacco, and those certificates are to be presented to 
a court of claims, there to lie perhaps till they are quite 
forgotten, so much dissatisfaction is created, that many, 
I believe, rather than apprehend one, would aid fifty 
to escape, and this, too, among our own people. 
</p><p>
Another thing, which I should be glad to know, is, 
whether the act of Assembly prohibits the whole forces, 
or only the drafts, from marching out of Virginia, and 
whether it is contrary to law, even to take the drafts out, 
provided it is done with their own consent. If we can
 On this head Mr. Speaker Robinson replied ; " The Committee were 
all in opinion with you, that the keeping of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> was an unnecessary expense ; but upon my mentioning their opinion to the Governor, 
he appeared very warm, and said Lord Loudoun might do what he pleased, 
but for his part he would not remove the garrison, nor order the fort to be 
demolished." 
</p><p>

</p><p>
not take any of the forces out of the colony, the disadvantages, which the country may labor under, are not to 
be described ; for the enemy, in that case, may commit 
the most unheard-of cruelties, and, by stepping across 
the Potomac, evade pursuit, and mock our best endeavours to scourge them. 
</p><p>
The inconveniences that arise from paying the soldiers in large bills, are not to be conceived. We are 
obliged to give the pay of two or three soldiers to one 
man. He, ten to one, drinks, games, or pays it away ; 
by which means the parties are all dissatisfied, and perpetually complaining for want of their pay. It also 
prevents them from laying out their pay for absolute 
necessaries, and obliges them many times to drink it 
out ; for they put it into the tavern-keeper's hands, who 
will give no change, unless they will consent to receive 
the greatest part in liquor. In short, for five shillings 
cash you may at any time purchase^ a month's pay from 
the soldiers ; in such contempt do they hold the currency. Besides small bills, if the thing is practicable, I 
should be extremely glad to receive some part of the 
money in Spanish and Portugal gold and silver. Many 
things are wanted for the use of the regiment, which 
cannot be had here, and may be obtained at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>; but the depreciation of our money, out of the 
colony, has prevented my sending thither. 
</p><p>
At the repeated instances of the soldiers, I must pay 
so much regard to their representations, as to transmit 
their complaints. They think it extremely hard, as it is 
indeed, Sir, that they, who perhaps do more duty, and 
undergo more fatigue and hardship, from the nature of 
the service and situation of the country, than any other 
troops on the continent, should be allowed the least pay, 
and smallest encouragements in other respects. The 
Carolinians receive British pay ; the Marylanders, I believe, the same ; Pennsylvania is exorbitant in rewarding 
her soldiers ; as to the Jerseys and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I am not 
informed ; but the New England governments give more 
than a shilling per day, our money, besides an allowance of rum, pease, tobacco, vinegar, ginger, and the lik( 
</p><p>
Our soldiers complain, that their pay is insufficient, 
even to furnish shoes, shirts, and stockings, which theii 
officers, in order to keep them fit for duty, oblige them 
to provide. This, they say, deprives them of the means 
of purchasing any of the conveniences or necessaries of 
life, and compels them to drag through a disagreeable 
service, in the most disagreeable manner. That their 
pay will not afford more than enough to keep them in 
clothes, I should be convinced for these reasons, if experience had not taught me. The British soldiers are 
allowed eight pence sterling per day, with many necessaries that ours are not, and can buy what is requisite 
upon the cheapest terms ; and they lie one half the year 
in camp, or garrison, when they cannot consume the 
fifth part of what ours do in continual marches over 
mountains, rocks, and rivers. Then, Sir, is it possible 
that our men, who receive a fourth less, have two pence 
per day stopped for their regimental clothing, and all 
other stoppages made that British soldiers have, and are 
obliged, by being in continual action, to lay in triple the 
quantity of ammunition and clothes, and at double the 
price, should be able to clear themselves ? It is not to 
be done, and this is the reason why the men have 
always been so bare of clothes. 
</p><p>
And I dare say you will be candid enough to allow, 
that few men would choose to have their lives exposed 
to the incessant insults of a merciless enemy, without 
some view or hope of a reward. Another thing gives 
them great uneasiness, and that is, seeing no regular 
provision made for the maimed and wounded. They acknowledge the generosity of the Assembly, and have 
the highest veneration for that respectable House ; they 
look with gratitude on the care, which has been taken 
of their brother soldiers ; but they say, this is only an 
act of will, and another Assembly may be much less 
liberal. They have no certainty, that this generosity 
will continue, and consequently can have nothing in 
view but the most gloomy prospects, and no encouragement to be bold and active ; for as soon as they become 
unfit for service by their wounds, they may be discharged, and turned upon an uncharitable world to beg, 
steal, or starve. In short, they have a true sense of all 
that can happen, and do not think slightly of the fatigues 
they encounter, in scouring these mountains with their 
provisions on their backs, lying out and watching for the 
enemy, with no other covering to shelter them from the 
inclemency of the weather, than the trees and rocks. 
The old soldiers are affected, and complain of their 
hardships and little encouragement in piteous terms ; 
and they give these as reasons for so much desertion. 
The money expended in paying for deserters, expresses, horse-hire, losses and abuse of horses, would 
go a great length towards advancing their pay, which I 
hope would contribute not a little to remove the cause of this expense. 
</p><p>
I would not have it understood, however, that I mean 
to recommend any thing extraordinary ; no, I would 
give them British pay, and allow them the same privileges during their stay in the service, and this as a 
reward or compliment for their toil, rather than a matter 
of right. Were the country to give them one suit of 
regimental clothes a year, without receiving the two 
pence stoppage, it would be a full allowance, and cause 
great content and satisfaction. All they want is to be 
entitled to the privileges and immunities of soldiers, of which they are well informed, by some who have been 
a number of years in the army. They would then think 
it no hardship to be subject to the punishments and fatigues. Were this done, and an order given by the 
Committee empowering me to provide for them, according to the rules and customs of the army, I then shoul( 
know what I am about. I could do it without hesitation 
or fear, and, I am convinced, to the satisfaction and interest of the country. As the case now stands, we arc 
upon such an odd establishment, under such uncertaii 
regulations, and subject to so much inconvenience, that 
I am wandering hi a wilderness of difficulties, and am 
ignorant of the ways to extricate myself, and to act for 
the satisfaction of the country, the soldiers, or myself. 
Having no certain rules for the direction of my conduct, 
I am afraid to turn to this hand or to that, lest it should 
be censured. If such an order, as I before spoke of, 
were to issue from your Board, I would then immediately provide upon the best terms a quantity of all kinds 
of ammunition and clothes for the use of the regiment, 
and deliver them out to each company, as their wants 
required, taking care to deduct the value of all such 
things from their pay. By these means the soldiers 
would be always provided and fit for duty, and would 
do it cheerfully, and the country sustain no other loss, 
than advancing the money for a few months to lay in 
those stores, as this money would always be restored by the soldiers again.
</p><p>
I have hitherto been afraid to advance any sums of 
money for this salutary purpose, and have always bought 
the articles at extravagant prices, and been obliged to 
send to different parts, ere they could be had, which has also contributed to cause the nakedness of the soldiers. The officers are almost as uneasy and dispirited 
as the men, doing every part of duty with languor and 
indifference. When ordered to provide themselves 
with suitable necessaries, they complain of an uncertain 
establishment, and the probability of being disbanded, 
and the things rendered useless. So that I really and 
most heartily wish for a change. The surgeon has entreated me to mention his case, which I shall do by 
enclosing his letters. He has behaved extremely well, 
and discharged his duty, in every capacity, Since he 
came to the regiment. He has long discovered an inclination to quit the service, the encouragement being so 
small ; and I Relieve he would have done it, had not the 
officers, to show their regard and willingness to detain 
him, subscribed each one day's pay in every month. 
This, as they are likely to be so much dispersed, and 
can receive no benefit from him, they intend to withdraw, and therefore he begs me to solicit the gentlemen 
of the Committee in his behalf; otherwise he will be 
obliged to seek some other method of getting his livelihood. 
</p><p>
I beg, Sir, with very great earnestness, that the 
gentlemen of the Committee will communicate their 
sentiments fully upon all these several matters, and approve or disapprove every thing therein. I only wait to 
know their intention, and then to act in strict conformity 
with it. 
</p><p>
If the Committee find my account satisfactory and 
distinct, as I have no doubt they will, it would be conferring a great obligation, if they would make a final 
settlement to that date, and begin a new account, as it 
would be the means of keeping matters more clear and 
intelligible hereafter. Long accounts, and references to 
doubtful points, instead of gaining any light, are but darkened and confused by procrastination. The late 
regulation of our companies will occasion more regularity 
in the paymaster's account, and be more satisfactory in 
every shape, for the future. Besides, the gentlemen of 
the Committee will find little trouble, or difficulty, in 
looking over a short account, kept in a regular method, 
plain and perspicuous, which is the very life of business. 
I would again entreat your regard to my request, for 
these and many other reasons.

I am, dear Sir, yours, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The return of the express, that came with the account 
of La Force's escape, (for which accident I am extremely concerned, and fear its consequences if he is 
not retaken,) affords me an opportunity to inform you 
of some occurrences, which have happened since my 
last 
</p><p>
Repeated complaints and applications from all quarters for men, but more especially from the garrisons, 
which secure the communication with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
obliged me to order a company from Captain Wag
 La Force, it will be remembered, was one of the prisoners taken in 
the skirmish with Jumonville's party. He was capable, enterprising, active, and had been instrumental, before his capture, in exciting the Indians 
to commit depredations on the frontiers. This was deemed a sufficient 
reason, by the Governor of Virginia, for retaining him in custody, contrary 
to the articles of capitulation at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great meadows" rel="city">Great Meadows</a>. He was thrown into 
the jail at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>. From this abode, after more than two years' 
confinement, he had the address to escape, but was seized before he 
had advanced far into the country, remanded to prison, and loaded with 
ii\;ns.

</p><p>
geners detachment (for none else could spare a man) 
to reinforce and enable those garrisons to send escorts 
with wagons and expresses, going to and returning from 
that fort. Captain Waggener's command was thus reduced to a number insufficient to disperse parties among 
the settlers, and retain a strength to conduct the building of the forts. The grand point then turned on this ; 
whether he was to neglect the inhabitants and build the 
forts, or neglect the forts and protect the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
His council were of the latter opinion unanimously, 
and sent to know my sentiments, which I own corresponded with theirs, and for these reasons. First, I look 
upon it, that the protection of the inhabitants was the 
motive for ordering these forts ; and to lose them, while 
we are at work, would be perverting the intention. 
Secondly, we have built some forts and altered others, 
as far south on the Potomac waters as any settlers have 
been molested ; and there only remains one body of inhabitants, at a place called the Upper Tract, who need 
a guard. Thither I have ordered a party. Beyond 
this, if I am not misinformed, there is nothing but a continued series of mountains uninhabited, until we get 
over to the waters of James River, not far from the fort, 
which takes its name from your Honor; and thence to 
Mayo River. Captain Hogg, by your orders, is to have 
the direction. If I have done amiss, in not adhering to 
the letter of the law, I hope you will intimate the same, 
and give directions how I am to proceed. 
</p><p>
Two or three men have been killed and scalped at 
different places, since my last, though every precaution 
has been taken to prevent it. The fatiguing service, 
low pay, and great hardships in which our men have 
been engaged, cause, notwithstanding the greatest care 
and vigilance to the contrary, great and scandalous desertions. Yesterday I received an account, from Captain Stewart, of sixteen men deserting in a party. 
Frequently two or three went off before, as they have 
done from this place. We never fail to pursue, and use 
all possible means to apprehend them ; but seldom with 
success, as they are generally aided and assisted by the 
inhabitants. Two parties are now in pursuit of these 
fellows, who have made towards the northward to enlist with the recruiting officers in Pennsylvania. Unless 
a stop can be put to it, I fear we shall lose numbers of 
our men. 
</p><p>
A report prevailed in town yesterday, said to come 
from a man, who had it from a person that was at Governor Morris's treaty with the Indians, and heard them 
say, that a large body composed of different nations, and 
headed by some French, intended to attack <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> this fall. Reports of this kind often take rise 
without good foundation ; yet, as this is an affair of great 
importance, the slightest intelligence ought not to be 
discountenanced, especially when we consider that our 
provision, and, what is still more valuable, all our ammunition and stores, are lodged in that defenceless place. 
The consequence of a successful enterprise of this sort, 
and the absolute impossibility (considering the weakness 
of the place, badness of situation, and division of our 
force) of preventing its falling, are, without previous 
notice, motives sufficient for apprehending the worst. 
Therefore, notwithstanding I enlarged upon this subject 
in a former letter, I think it my duty to hint it again, and 
to ask directions how I am to proceed. 
</p><p>
It is true, I give no credit to this intelligence, because 
I flatter myself such important information as this would 
be communicated, in the most distinct and expeditious 
manner, by Governor Morris ; yet, it being an expedition they cannot fail of succeeding in, what should deter 
them from attempting it ? We have certain advice, that two of our deserters have reached <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, who 
were heard to speak in high terms, before they escaped, of the reward that would be got for communicating the 
weakness of the works and garrison at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
As a general meeting of all the persons concerned in 
the estate of my deceased brother is appointed to be 
held at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, about the middle of September next, 
for making a final settlement of all his affairs, and as I 
am very deeply interested, not only as an executor, and 
heir of part of his estate, but also in a very important 
dispute, subsisting between Colonel Lee, who married 
the widow, and my brothers and self, concerning a devise in the will, which brings the whole personal estate 
in question, I say, as this is a matter of very great 
moment to me, I hope your Honor will readily consent 
to my attending this meeting, provided no disadvantage 
is likely to arise during my absence ; in which case, I 
shall not offer to quit my command. 
</p><p>
If war is to be declared at this place, I should be glad 
if your Honor would direct the manner. I know there 
is ceremony required, but the order I am ignorant of.

TO LORD FAIRFAX. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 29 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
It is with infinite concern, that I see the distresses o 
the people, and hear their complaints, without being 
able to afford them relief. I have so often troubled you 
for aid from the militia, that I am almost ashamed to repeat my demands ; nor should I do it again, did I not 
think it absolutely necessary at this time to save the most valuable and flourishing part of this county from 
immediate desertion. And how soon the remaining 
part, as well as the adjacent counties, may share the 
same fate, is but too obvious to reason, and to your 
Lordship's good sense. The whole settlement of Conococheague in Maryland is fled, and there now remain 
only two families from thence to Fredericktown, w r hich 
is several miles below the Blue Ridge. We are thus 
quite exposed, and have no better security on that side, 
than the Potomac River, for many miles below the Shenandoah ; and how great a security that is to us, may 
easily be discerned, when we consider, with what facility 
the enemy have passed and repassed it already. That 
the Maryland settlements are all abandoned is certainly 
a fact, as I have had the accounts transmitted to me by 
several hands, and confirmed yesterday by Henry 
Brinker, who left Monocosy the day before, and who 
also affirms, that three hundred and fifty wagons had 
passed that place to avoid the enemy, within the space 
of three days. 
</p><p>
I thought it expedient to communicate this intelligence, that your Lordship may know the reasons for 
asking succours for these unhappy people, and how 
absolutely necessary it is to use, without delay, such 
vigorous measures as will save that settlement from 
total desolation. 
</p><p>
We see, my Lord, the absurdity of the people's arguments, and the consequences of leaving one county, 
nay, one part of a county, or, to go still farther, a single 
company, that is more exposed than another, to defend 
itself and the parts in danger. When Hampshire was 
invaded, and called on Frederic for assistance, the people of the latter refused their aid, answering, " Let them 
defend themselves, as we shall do if they come to us." 
Now that the enemy have forced through that county, and begin to infest this, those a little removed from danger are equally infatuated ; and it will thus be, I fear, 
until all in turn fall a sacrifice to an insulting and merciless enemy. 
</p><p>
These observations may be improperly offered to 
your Lordship, but they occur in so strong a light to 
me, that I could not resist the impulse to make them. 
I am so weak-handed here, that I cannot, without stopping the public works, spare a man to these people's 
assistance. Yet I look upon the retaining of them to be 
so essential to the well-being of the county in general, 
that I have ordered all the men, that can possibly be 
spared, to march thitherwards ; and they will accordingly set out to-morrow morning, to remain there until 
your Lordship can relieve them, that they may return to 
these works, which in my opinion are of no little importance to the safety of the county, if we should be attacked 
by numbers, as we have reason to apprehend. I hope 
your Lordship will exert your authority in raising men 
for this salutary end, and that you will think it advisable 
to make every company furnish its quota. This will 
remove the complaints of the people below, who say 
they cannot leave their families to the mercy of the 
enemy, while they are scouring the woods. 
</p><p>
This is the reason given by some why Caton's party 
consists of but ten men, while others say it proceeds 
from dislike to the man. I acquainted the Governor 
with your Lordship's order for raising fifty men for this 
service, who approved it, and has been pleased to direct 
me to continue them as long as I see cause. 
</p><p>
I cannot conclude without again mentioning how 
agreeable it would be, if your Lordship would order a 
party immediately to those parts, that I may withdraw 
my men to their duty at this place. 
</p><p>
I am, my Lord, &c.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 23 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Under your kind indulgence I came to this place a 
few days ago, expecting to meet the executors of my 
deceased brother, in order to make a final settlement of 
his affairs. I was disappointed in this design, by the 
Assembly having called away the principal persons concerned. 
</p><p>
I shall remark, in obedience to your request, such 
things relating to the Virginia regiment as occur to me 
now, and require the Assembly's attention ; and if any 
thing further presents itself, I shall communicate it from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, for which place I shall set out this afternoon. I have often urged, for one thing, the necessity 
of enforcing the articles of war in all their parts, where 
it is not incompatible with the nature of this service. I 
have been surprised, as often as I have reflected upon this 
subject, and really cannot devise any reason, why the 
Assembly should be so much averse to fixed rules for 
the regulation of their forces, of which long experience 
in established armies fully evinces the necessity. My 
surprise is yet increased, when I consider how cautiously 
worded the act of Parliament is, to preserve the rights 
and liberties of the people against the arbitrary proceedings of the military officers. 
</p><p>
We are under a kind of regulation at present, that 
renders command extremely difficult and precarious, as 
no crimes, I believe, are particularly noticed in the act 
of Assembly, except mutiny and desertion, notwithstanding there are many others equally punishable by 
act of Parliament. 
</p><p>
One thing 'more, which particularly requires attention, is the billeting, quartering, and dieting of soldiers 
upon the inhabitants, which in many cases cannot be avoided. 
</p><p>
I have, in several letters to your Honor, expressed 
my opinion with candor and freedom, about the situation, works, and garrison at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I shall, 
nevertheless, as you command me to lay before you 
such things as require the Assembly's notice, repeat on 
this occasion my fears once more for that place, that I 
may avoid, if any accident should happen to it, the malicious reflections, which inseparably attend misfortunes 
of this kind. I have upon all occasions said, that Fort 
Cumberland is a place of no strength, and never can be 
tenable from the badness of the ground. It is far remote 
from any of our inhabitants, exposed to the insults of 
the enemy, contains all our valuable stores (save what 
I have removed to Winchester), and a garrison of one 
hundred and seventy men, which is too large a number 
to be spared from other places, merely to defend the 
stores at this, and too small to afford detachments to 
waylay and surprise the enemy. I shall, therefore, beg 
leave to observe, in regard to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, that if 
it is continued, we must be confined to act defensively, 
and keep our forces dispersed as they now are. The 
place must be fortified with strong works, or else it will 
inevitably fall, garrison and stores, into the enemy's 
hands. I enclose Colonel Stephen's letter on this head, 
in answer to one I wrote to him. 
</p><p>
I did, from the beginning, express my sentiments 
against having small garrisons in a chain of forts along 
our frontiers. We have a frontier of such immense extent, that to build forts at convenient distances would 
employ such numbers of men, and divide our troops 
into such trifling parties, that no one part could defend itself, much less the inhabitants, were the country invaded. 
</p><p>
The most effectual way that I can see, though none can answer while we act defensively, is to have no more 
than three or four large, strong forts, built at convenient 
distances, upon our frontiers ; in which strong garrisons 
must be maintained, that parties able to cope with the 
enemy may be sent out, and these parties kept in constant succession ranging and scouring the country. 
Here a difficulty will arise, as others will in every defensive plan, that can be offered. How are these ranging parties, sent out in this manner, and probably 
remaining on the scout from ten to fourteen days, to be 
supplied with provisions, the inhabitants being so thinly 
settled, and the forts so far extended? The difficulty 
is great, yet not sufficient to render this plan inferior to 
the former. For in the other case, when the enemy is 
heard of, the garrison can only send out parties, more fit 
to reconnoitre than oppose. These parties, if they 
prove too small (which in all probability they may), are 
certain of falling a prey to the enemy, whose numbers 
cannot be known until thus proved. I could urge many 
things more on this head, but believe it useless. What 
I have already said, I hope, is sufficient to give your 
Honor a hint of the matter, and that is all I aim at. We 
may form many schemes to defend ourselves, but experience will show, that none but removing the cause of the 
difficulties will prove effectual. Unless the Assembly 
concerts some measures to augment their force, the country, I fear, must inevitably fall. The frontiers, within 
twelve months, have been totally deserted for fifty miles 
and upwards from north to south, and all below that distance greatly thinned by the removal of numbers ; occasioned in some measure by Maryland and Pennsylvania 
giving ground so much faster than we do, which exposes 
a very fine country of ours on that side, as low as Monocosy in Maryland, several miles on this side of the Blue Ridge. 
</p><p>
I believe I might also add, that no person, who regards his character, will undertake a command without 
the means of preserving it ; since his conduct is culpable 
for all misfortunes, and never right but when successful. 
</p><p>
I cannot think any number under two thousand men 
sufficient to cover our extensive frontiers, and with that 
number it would be impossible to prevent misfortunes, 
however easy the world may think it. What means can 
be used to raise these men, I know not, unless the enlisting of servants is thought expedient; and that alone 
will prove ineffectual. Some determination should be 
had about the ranging companies. Under what regulations those are in Augusta, and what service they have 
done the country, I know not. Those in this quarter 
have done little, and both companies amount to about 
thirty men only at this time. I apprehend it will be 
thought advisable to keep a garrison always at Fort 
Loudoun ; for which reason I would beg leave to represent the number of tippling-houses in Winchester as a 
great nuisance to the soldiers, who, by this means, in 
despite of the utmost care and vigilance, are, so long as 
their pay holds out, incessantly drunk, and unfit for 
service. 
</p><p>
The rates of their liquor are immoderately high, and 
the publicans throughout the country charge one shilling 
a meal, currency, for soldier's diet; and the country 
only allows the recruiting officer eight pence a day for 
the maintenance of a soldier, by which means he loses 
in proportion as he obtains men, which is much complained of, and is in reality a discouraging circumstance 
demanding redress. The want of a chaplain, I humbly 
conceive, reflects dishonor on the regiment, as all other 
officers are allowed. The gentlemen of the corps are 
sensible of this, and proposed to support one at their 
private expense. But I think it w r ould have a more graceful appearance were he appointed as others are. 
I could wish some method were practised to bring the 
commonalty acquainted with the laws against entertaining deserters, and to enforce those laws. 
</p><p>
An officer of the American Regiment is recruiting at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, and purposes to go through the country, 
and pass into Carolina. He has enlisted some servants, 
and intends to take all he can meet with. This, I believe, may evince the necessity of our following his 
example, otherwise we shall suffer our .colony to be 
weakened without receiving any immediate advantage ; 
though I imagine the expense will be nearly the same 
to the country, whether they are in the Bang's or country's service. 
</p><p>
I am, with all due respect, your Honor's, &c.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a>, 10 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
This day within five miles of the Carolina line, as I was proceeding to the southernmost fort in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a>, I 
met Major Lewis on his return from the Cherokees, with seven men and three women only of that nation. 
The causes of this unhappy disappointment I have desired him to communicate, that you may take measures 
accordingly. This account is sent by express, to give the earliest notice while the Assembly is sitting. 
</p><p>
I shall defer going into a particular detail of my observations on the situation of our frontiers, until I return 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, as I expect by that time to be more intimately acquainted with the unhappy circumstances of 
the people. Yet I shall not omit mentioning some occurrences, which have happened in my tour to this 
place. I wrote to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, that I should set out the next day for Augusta. I accordingly did so, 
September 29th, with Captain M c Neil ; and hearing at the Court-House, that the Indians still continued their 
. depredations, although not so openly as at first, I applied to Colonel Stewart, then present, to raise a party of the 
militia, and proposed to head them myself, march to Jackson's River, scour the woods, and, if possible, fall in 
with the enemy. He gave me very little encouragement to expect any men, yet desired I would wait four 
days, till Monday, and he would use his endeavours to collect a body. Until Tuesday I waited, and only five 
men appeared. This being too inconsiderable a number to expose to a triumphant enemy, I was advised to 
apply to Colonel Buchanan for men, between whom and Colonel Stewart there was contention about command. 
</p><p>
Colonel Buchanan resided at Luney's Ferry, on James River, sixty miles along the road to Vass's, on the Roanoke, w r here Captain Hogg was building a fort, and to 
which place I intended to proceed, if I could get men to range along the frontiers with me. I set out immediately for his house, attended by Captain Preston, who 
was kind enough to be my conductor; and I acquainted the Colonel with the motives that brought me thither. 
He told me with very great concern, that it was not in his power to raise men; for that, three days before, some 
of the militia, in a fort, about fifteen miles above his house, at the head of Catawba Creek, commanded by 
one Colonel Nash, were attacked by the Indians, which occasioned all that settlement to break up totally, even 
as far as the ferry at Luney's ; that he had ordered three companies to repair thither, and march against the 
enemy, and not one man came, except a captain, lieutenant, and seven or eight men from Bedford. 
</p><p>
Finding that it was impossible to get a party to range 
and scour the frontiers, it remained only to proceed 
without men to see the situation of the forts, or to return back. The latter I was loath to do, since I had 
come thus far, and was anxious to see what posture of 
defence they were in. I therefore determined to come 
forward, at least to Vass's, and accordingly set out in 
company with Colonel Buchanan, who, being desirous 
that I might see and relate their unhappy condition, undertook to accompany me. We arrived safely at Vass's, 
where Captain Hogg, with only eighteen of his company, 
was building a fort, which must employ him till Christmas, without more assistance. One Captain Hunt from 
Lunenburg, was there with thirty men ; but none of 
them would strike a stroke, unless I would engage to 
see them paid forty pounds of tobacco a day, which is 
provided by act of Assembly for militia carpenters. 
This I certainly could not do, as your Honor, who I 
thought had ordered them purposely out for this duty, 
had given no directions in the affair. Whatever expectations your Honor may have had from the militia's 
assistance, I am told they never lent a hand, save a few, 
that first came out with Captain Hogg, whom he has 
paid after the same rates with our men, at sixpence a 
day. Vass's place is a pass of very great importance, 
affording a road for the enemy, but secure, if strongly 
garrisoned. 
</p><p>
From Vass's I came off with a servant and a guide, 
to visit the range of forts in this county. In less than 
two hours after, two men were killed along the same 
road, as will appear by Captain M c Neil's letter, which I 
have just received, and herewith send, to let you see, 
by the account of Captain Hunt's behaviour, what dependence may be put on the militia. The inhabitants 
are so sensible of their danger, if left to the protection 
of these people, that not a man will stay at his place. 
This I have from their own mouths, and the principal 
persons of Augusta county. The militia are under such 
bad order and discipline, that they will go and come 
when and where they please, without regarding time, 
their officers, or the safety of the inhabitants, consulting 
solely their own inclinations. There should be, according to your orders, one third of the militia of these parts 
now on duty at once ; instead of that, I believe scarce 
one thirtieth is out. They are to be relieved every 
month. More than that time is taken up in marching 
to and from their stations, and they will not wait one 
day longer than the limited time, whether they are relieved or not, let the necessity for it be ever so urgent. 
An instance of this kind happened in my presence about 
four days ago, in the case of Captain Daniel from Albemarle, who was intreated by Colonel Buchanan to stay 
at the time he was gathering or attempting to gather 
men, upon the alarm at the Catawba settlement before 
mentioned. The Captain's month was out, and go he 
must and did. Nay, I believe I may venture to say, 
that, whether his month had been out or not, this circumstance would have induced him to go; for the same 
gentleman went away from Vass's, because he thought 
it a dangerous post, giving that for his reason, and left 
Captain Hogg with eighteen men, exposed to the insults 
of the enemy. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may be thought I am partial in my relation, 
and reflect unjustly. I really do not, Sir. I scorn to 
make unjust remarks on the behaviour of the militia, as 
much as I despise and contemn the persons, who detract from mine and the character of the regiment. 
Were it not, that I consult the good of the public, and think these garrisons merit attention, I should not 
deem it worth mentioning. I only wish to make the 
country sensible, how ardently I have studied to promote its cause, and desire very sincerely, that my successor may fill my place more to its satisfaction in every 
respect, than I have been able to do. I mentioned in 
my last, that I did not think a less number than two 
thousand men would be sufficient to defend our extensive and much exposed frontiers from the ravages of 
the enemy. I have not had one reason to alter my 
opinion, but many to strengthen and confirm it. And I 
flatter myself, that the country will, when my determinations are known, be convinced that I have no sinister 
views, no vain motives of commanding a number of men, 
which urge me to recommend this number, but that it 
proceeds from the knowledge I have acquired of the 
country and people to be defended. 
</p><p>
Your Honor, I hope, will give directions about laying 
in provisions on our southern frontiers. It is not in my 
pow r er to do it, as I know not what troops can or will be 
put there. The regiment is at present too weak to 
allow any men to march from the quarter in which they 
are now stationed. I shall set out this day on my return to the fort, at the head of Catawba Creek, where 
Colonel Buchanan promised to meet me with a party to 
conduct me along our frontiers, up Jackson's River to 
Fort Dinwiddie, and higher if needful. If he does not 
meet me, I shall immediately proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 
as it will be impossible to do any thing without men. 
</p><p>
If you think proper to advance the pay of the militia, 
in order to engage them to work, please to acquaint 
Captain Hogg therewith, and send him money for that 
purpose. Were more men ordered to cover his party, 
and assist in the work, it would be highly advantageous, for he is greatly exposed. Major Lewis is extremely unwell. 1 am hurried a good deal, but have 
given a plain account of all the several matters mentioned in the foregoing sheet. I am, &c.

<p>
TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 9 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=halifax" rel="city">Halifax</a> I promised a particular detail of 
my observations upon the situation of our frontiers, 
when I arrived at this place. Although I was pretty 
explicit in that letter, I cannot avoid recapitulating part 
of the subject now. 
</p><p>
From Fort Trial on Smith's River, I returned to Fort 
William on the Catawba, where I met Colonel Buchanan 
with about thirty men, chiefly officers, to conduct me up 
Jackson's River, along the range of forts. With this 
small company of irregulars, with whom order, regularity, circumspection, and vigilance were matters of 
derision and contempt, we set out, and, by the protection of Providence, reached Augusta Court-House in 
seven days, without meeting the enemy ; otherwise we 
must have fallen a sacrifice, through the indiscretion of 
these whooping, hallooing gentlemen soldiers ! 
</p><p>
This jaunt afforded me an opportunity of seeing the 
bad regulation of the militia, the disorderly proceedings 
of the garrisons, and the unhappy circumstances of the 
inhabitants. 
</p><p>
First, of the militia. The difficulty of collecting them 
on any emergency, I have often spoken of; and I appeal 
to sad experience, how great a disadvantage it is, that 
the enemy should have every opportunity to plunder, 
kill, and escape, before the militia can afford any assistance. And not to mention the expensiveness of their 
service in general, I can instance several cases, where a 
captain, lieutenant, and, I may add, an ensign, with two 
or three sergeants, and six or eight men, will go upon 
duty at a time. The proportion of expense in this case 
is so unjust and obvious, that your Honor wants it not 
to be proved. 
</p><p>
Then these men, when raised, are to be continued 
only one month on duty, half of which time is lost in 
their marching out and home, especially those from the 
adjacent counties, who must be on duty some time before they reach their stations, by which means double 
sets of men are in pay at the same time, and for the 
same service. Again, the waste of provision they make 
is unaccountable ; no method or order in being served 
or purchasing at the best rates, but quite the reverse. 
Allowance for each man, as in the case of other soldiers, 
they look upon as the highest indignity, and would 
sooner starve, than carry a few days' provision on their 
backs for conveniency. But upon their march, when 
breakfast is wanted, they knock down the first beef 
they meet with, and, after regaling themselves, march 
on till dinner, when they take the same method, and so 
for supper, to the great oppression of the people. Or, 
if they chance to impress cattle for provision, the valuation is left to ignorant and interested neighbours, who 
have suffered by those practices, and, despairing of their 
pay, exact high prices, and thus the public is imposed 
upon at all events. I might add, I believe, that, for the 
want of proper laws to govern the militia (I cannot ascribe it to any other cause), they are obstinate, selfwilled, perverse, of little or no service to the people, 
and very burthensome to the country. Every individual 
has his own crude notions of things, and must undertake 
to direct. If his advice is neglected, he thinks himself 
slighted, abused, and injured ; and, to redress his wrongs, will depart for his home. These, Sir, are literally matters of fact, partly from persons of undoubted 
veracity, but chiefly from my own observations. 
</p><p>
Secondly, concerning the garrisons. I found them 
very weak for want of men ; but more so from indolence 
and irregularity. I saw none in a posture of defence, 
and few that might not be surprised with the greatest 
ease. An instance of this appeared at Dickinson's Fort, 
where the Indians ran down, caught several children 
playing under the walls, and had got to the gate before 
they were discovered. Was not Vass's Fort surprised, 
and a good many souls lost, in the same manner ? They 
keep no guard, but just when the enemy is about, and 
they are under fearful apprehensions ; nor ever stir out 
of the forts, from the time they reach them, till relieved 
on their month being expired ; at which time they 
march off, be the event what it will. Of the ammunition 
they are as careless as of the provisions, firing it away 
frequently at targets for wagers. On our journey, as 
we approached one of their forts, we heard a quick fire 
for several minutes, and concluded for certain that they 
were attacked ; so we marched in the best manner to 
their relief ; but when we came up, we found they were 
diverting themselves at marks. These men afford no 
assistance to the unhappy settlers, who are driven from 
their plantations, either in securing their harvests, or 
gathering their corn. Lieutenant Bullitt, commanding 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, sent to Major Lewis of Albemarle, 
who commanded a party of sixty militia at Miller's, 
about fifteen miles above him, where were also thirty 
men of Augusta, for some men to join his small parties 
to gather the corn. Major Lewis refused assistance, 
and would not divide his men. I wrote to him, but got 
no answer. Mr. Bullitt has done what he could with 
his few men, not quite thirty. Of the many forts, which I passed by, I saw but one or two that had their captains present, they being absent chiefly on their own 
business, and had given leave to several of the men to 
do the same. Yet these persons, I will venture to say, 
will charge the country their full month's pay. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the wretched and unhappy situation of the 
inhabitants needs few words, after a slight reflection on 
the preceding circumstances. They are fully sensible 
of their misery ; they feel their insecurity in relying on 
militia, who are slow in coming to their assistance, indifferent about their preservation, unwilling to continue, 
and regardless of every thing but their own ease. In 
short, they are so affected with approaching ruin, that 
the whole back country is in a general motion towards 
the southern colonies ; and I expect that scarce a family 
will inhabit Frederic, Hampshire, or Augusta, in a little 
time. They petitioned me in the most earnest manner 
for companies of the regiment. But alas ! it is not in 
my power to assist them with any, unless I leave this 
dangerous quarter more exposed than they are. I 
promised, at their particular request, to address your 
Honor and the Assembly in their behalf, that a regular 
force may be established in lieu of the militia and ranging companies, which are of much less service, and of 
infinitely more cost to the country. Were this done, 
the whole w r ould be under one direction, and any misbehaviour could never pass with impunity. Whereas 
the others are soldiers at will. And, indeed, the manner in which some of the ranging captains have obtained 
their commissions, if I am rightly informed, is by imposture and artifice. They produce a list, I am told, to 
your Honor, of sundry persons, who are willing to serve 
under them. One part, it is said, consists of fictitious 
names ; another, the names of persons who never saw 
the list ; and the remainder are persons drawn into it by fallacious promises, that cannot be performed without detriment to the service. But were it otherwise, 
surely any person, who considers the pay of the soldiers 
and that of the militia, will find a considerable difference, though both under the best regulations. 
</p><p>
As defensive measures are evidently insufficient for 
the security and safety of the country, I hope no arguments are requisite to prove the necessity of altering 
them to a vigorous offensive war, in order to remove 
the evil. But, should the Assembly still indulge that 
favorite scheme of protecting the inhabitants by forts 
along the frontiers, in which too many of them put their 
dependence, and as the building of these forts has been 
encouraged and confirmed by an act of Assembly, I 
take the liberty to present your Honor with a plan of 
the number of forts, and strength necessary to each, 
reaching entirely across our frontiers from north to 
south. This plan is calculated upon the most moderate 
and easy terms for sparing expense to the country, and, 
I believe, with tolerable propriety to answer the wishedfor design of protecting the settlers. Besides, most of 
the forts are already built by the country-people or soldiers, and require but little improvement, save one or 
two, as Dickinson's and Cox's. Your Honor will see 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> excluded in this list.
</p><p>
The advantage of having the militia in Augusta under one command, I have already hinted at ; and I 
think Major Lewis should have your Honor's orders to take that duty in hand, with directions to secure 
those important passes of Dickinson's and Vass's, by 
building a fort in the neighbourhood of Dickinson's, or 
by some other means. Were it practicable to get the 
people to assemble in little towns contiguous to these 
forts, it would contribute much to their mutual peace 
and safety, during the continuance of the Indian war. 
The Augusta people complain greatly for want of 
money. 
</p><p>
The other day eleven Indians of the Catawba tribe 
came here, and we undoubtedly might have had more 
of them, had the proper means been used to send trusty 
guides to invite and conduct them to us ; but this is neglected. One Matthew Tool makes his boast of stopping 
them until he shall be handsomely rewarded for bringing them ; and Major Lewis can inform you of one 
Bemer, who uses every method to hinder the Cherokees from coming to our assistance. Complaint should 
be made to Governor Littleton of these persons. Indian goods are much wanted to reward the Catawbas, 
and encourage them to engage in our service. 
</p><p>
Your Honor and the Assembly should determine 
several essential points ; namely, a proper method of 
paying rewards for taking up deserters, the present 
one being very discouraging, as it delays payment until 
Courts of Claims have decided ; means to replace the 
drafts, that must be discharged in December; ascertaining the pay of workmen employed on all public 
works, or empowering the commanding officer to agree 
on the cheapest terms he can with them ; how the masters of servants enlisted for the Virginia regiment are to 
be paid. We have already recruited more than fifty, 
and are daily dunned for payment by the masters. A 
report prevails, to my great surprise, though disbelief, 
that your Honor had told some persons, who applied to you for satisfaction for their servants, that I had 
no orders to enlist any. This false rumor occasions 
strange reflections, and must make me appear in a very 
unjust light to the world. I have, therefore, desisted 
from recruiting until you direct me in what manner 
those already obtained are to be paid for ; and I beg 
you will give me immediate advice on the affair, as the 
people are impatient, and threaten us with prosecutions 
from all quarters. 
</p><p>
Your Honor has herewith a copy of the council of 
war, held in behalf of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, in which the 
arguments are justly and fully laid down, both with regard to Virginia in particular, and to the three colonies 
in general. On the back of the copy are my sentiments candidly offered, and to your Honor I leave the 
determination of this important affair, f 
</p><p>
As to a chaplain, if the government will grant a subsistence, we can readily get a person of merit to accept 
the place, without giving the commissary any trouble on that point.
</p><p>
Your Honor has had advice of two spies, that were 
taken at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> ; one of whom they quickly 
hung up as his just reward, being a deserter ; the other 
was sent to Governor Sharpe, to give information of the 
infernal practices followed by some of the priests of that 
province, in holding correspondence with our enemy.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 2 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
When I wrote to 'you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, I expected to 
have been at or near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> by this time; 
but, upon coming here, and expecting wagons and provisions in readiness to go up with this escort, 1 received 
the enclosed from the commissary, which I send to 
evince that no delays or protracting of orders proceed 
from me. The return of our strength, which I called in as soon as I arrived, is herewith sent, signed by the 
adjutant, amounting, exclusive of the drafts, to eightyone effectives, including the sick, and young drummers, 
who were sent here to learn. 
</p><p>
When Captain Mercer went down, our strength consisted of about twenty-five more, including drafts, who 
have been sent over, since the middle of October, to 
Conococheague and Swearingham's Ferry, to encourage 
the inhabitants there to stay at their places, who otherwise were determined to forsake them. Your late and 
unexpected order has caused the utmost terror and 
consternation in the people, and will, I fear, be productive of numberless evils, not only to this place, and the 
public works erecting here, but to the people in general, 
who seem to be in the greatest dread of the consequences. The stores of every kind have all been 
brought from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, save those indispensably necessary there, at a very great expense, and lie 
in the court-house and other public buildings, to the no 
small inconvenience and detriment of the county. I 
have frequently been importuned by the members of 
the court, and other public officers, to remove them, and 
have as often by gentle persuasives protracted the time ; 
which was the more cheerfully granted, as it was evident there were no other places to receive them, and 
that I strove with the utmost diligence to prepare the 
proper receptacles. What course to take now, I know 
not, and hope you will direct. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, were you informed how much this 
place (which is in every respect our extreme and 
most exposed frontier, there being no inhabitants between this and the South Branch, and none there but 
such as are forted in,) I say, I am convinced, if you 
were truly informed of the situation of this place, of its 
importance and danger, you would not think it prudent 
to leave such a quantity of valuable stores exposed to 
the insults of a few ; for a very few indeed might reduce 
them and the town to ashes. In the next place, as I 
observed in my last letter, the works, which have been 
begun and continued with labor and hardship, lie open, 
untenable, and exposed to the weather, to say no more ; 
the materials, which have been collected with cost and 
infinite difficulty, will be at the mercy of every pillager ; 
our timber and scantling, used and burnt by the town's 
people ; our plank, which has been brought from afar, 
stolen and destroyed ; and the lime, if not stolen, left to 
be wasted. And this is not the worst. A building, 
which in time might and would have been very strong 
and defensible, and an asylum in the greatest danger, 
must be in a manner totally abandoned. As the case 
now stands, we have no place tenable, no place of 
safety ; all is exposed and open to attacks ; and by not 
having a garrison kept at this place, no convoys can get 
up to us at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and the communication 
with the inhabitants is entirely cut off, so that soldiers 
and inhabitants cannot assist each other. 
</p><p>
In regard to my residing at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, I shall 
lay before you such inconveniences as must unavoidably arise, while we pursue these defensive measures ; 
in doing which, I think I only do my duty. First, as 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> lies more advanced, and wide of all 
other forts, I shall be prevented from having the immediate direction of any but that. Secondly, the stores 
being at this place, and I at that, it will be impossible to 
deliver them regularly. I must either trust to a subaltern officer to order them discretionally, or else an 
express must be first sent to me, and then I must send 
to the storekeeper to deliver the necessaries wanted for 
each garrison. Moreover, there is no travelling to Fort 
Cumberland without endangering life, except with a 
pretty strong escort. Thirdly, by being at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> a total stagnation of business must ensue, because money is lodged with me for discharging all 
contingent expenses arising in the service, and no persons will, or can, come to me there. Consequently 
they will be slack in furnishing us with wagons and 
necessaries of every kind, which now by due payment 
may be had at call. Lastly, Winchester is in the centre, as it were, of all the forts, and is convenient for 
receiving intelligence and distributing orders. It also 
lies in a vale of land, that has suffered more than any 
other from the incursions of the enemy. 
</p><p>
I hope, after receiving a peremptory order, the mentioning of these things will not appear presuming or 
odd. I do not hesitate a moment to obey. On the 
contrary, I shall comply as soon as I can. I mean 
nothing more than to point out the consequences, that 
must necessarily attend this step, as I apprehend you 
were not thoroughly apprised of our situation. Some, 
Sir, who are inclined to put an unfavorable construction 
on this ingenuous recital, may say, that I am loath to 
leave Winchester. I declare, upon my honor, I am not, 
but had rather a thousand times be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
if I could do the duty there. I am tired of this place, 
the inhabitants, and the life I lead here ; and if, after 
what I have said, you should think it necessary for me 
to reside at that fort, I shall acquiesce with pleasure and 
cheerfulness, and be freed from much anxiety, plague, 
and business. To be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> sometimes, I 
think highly expedient, and have hitherto done it. 
Three weeks ago I came from that place. 
</p><p>
I have used every endeavour to detain drafts, but all 
in vain. They are home-sick and tired of work. They 
all declare, that, if an expedition is conducted in the 
spring, they will serve two, three, or four months ; but 
these are words of course. The Catawbas are out on 
the scout with an officer and some men of ours. They 
proposed, when I was at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, to stay only 
one moon, and then to set out for their nation, with a 
report of the country and its convenience to the enemy, 
(but rather with a report of our usage, I believe.) It 
therefore behoves us to reward them well, and keep 
them in temper. They applied to me for several necessaries, such as a suit of clothes for each, wampum, pipes, 
tomahawks, and silver trinkets for the wrists and arms. 
The wampum and tomahawks I have purchased. The 
want of the other articles may occasion somte murmuring, and there are very few things suitable at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. They seemed desirous, that an officer should 
return with them, and gave strong assurances of his 
bringing in a number. If you approve it, I shall endeavour to fix upon some officer, that falls most within 
their customs, and send him upon this duty. The Indians expect to be sent back upon horses. Do you 
approve that they should 1 I will not take upon me to 
buy horses without your orders. The Cherokees are 
not yet arrived, nor the arms from Augusta.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You are strictly required, immediately upon receipt 
of this, to transmit your provisions and stores to Captain Waggener's Fort, and there leave them. Then 
march your company to Pearsall's, in order to escort a quantity of flour to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, where you and 
your whole company are to remain. 
</p><p>
I expect you will pay due regard to this order, and 
put it in execution with the utmost alacrity, as it is in 
consequence of express directions from the Governor 
and Council. I heartily commiserate the poor, unhappy 
inhabitants, left by this means exposed to every incursion of a merciless enemy, and I wish it were in my 
power to offer them better support, than good wishes 
will afford. You may assure the settlement, that this 
unexpected, and, if I may be allowed to say it, unavoidable step was taken without my concurrence or knowledge ; that it is an express order from the Governor, 
and can neither be evaded nor delayed. Therefore, 
any representations to me of their danger, and the necessity of continuing troops among them, will be fruitless ; for, as I before observed, I have inclination, but 
no power left, to serve them. It is also the Governor's 
order, that the forts be left standing for the inhabitants 
to possess if they think proper.  
</p><p>
I am, Sir, yours, &c.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 19 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 10th came to hand the 15th; in 
consequence of which I despatched orders immediately 
to all the garrisons on the Branch to evacuate their forts, 
repair to Pearsall's, where they would meet the flour 
from this place, and escort it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. I fear the provisions purchased for the support of these 
forts, and now lying in bulk, will be wasted and destroyed, notwithstanding I have given directions to the 
assistant commissary on the Branch, and to Waggener's 
company, to use their utmost diligence in collecting the 
whole, and securing them where his company is posted. 
An escort, with all the flour we have been able to procure (amounting to an insufficient quantity for want of 
water), will set out from this place on Tuesday next. 
I expect to depart sooner myself, leaving directions with 
Captain Mercer, whom I have appointed to command 
here, and I shall repair as expeditiously as possible to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. 
</p><p>
I am a little at a loss to understand the meaning of 
your orders, and the opinion of the Council, when I am 
directed to evacuate all the stockade forts, and at the 
same time to march only one hundred men to Fort 
Cumberland, and to continue the like number here to 
garrison <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. If the stockade forts are all 
abandoned, there will be more men than are required 
for these two purposes, and the communication between 
them, of near eighty miles, will be left without a settler, 
unguarded and exposed. But I mean nothing more by 
this intimation, than to ascertain your intentions, to which 
I would willingly pay strict obedience. 
</p><p>
A return of the stores at this place is enclosed. I 
should have sent it before, but waited to add a return of 
those at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. None has yet come down. 
</p><p>
If Captain M c Neil goes to the Cherokee nation, it 
vvould be well for him to conduct the Catawbas home. 
But when I recommended an officer's going with them, 
it was with a view of engaging a body of their men to 
come to our assistance in the spring, and to march with 
their warriors, not choosing to trust altogether to their 
unmeaning promises and capricious humors. But you 
will be pleased to direct as you see proper in this affair. 
I have hitherto advanced very little money to the masters of servants, because I waited your directions. I 
received forty-one last night from Captain M c Neil, who 
desires leave to continue recruiting. I do not consent 
to it, until I know whether it is agreeable to you, and 
whether I may send out as many other officers as can 
be spared for the same service. 
</p><p>
I should have been exceedingly glad, if your Honor 
and the Council had directed in what manner Fort 
Cumberland is to be strengthened ; that is, whether it 
is to be made cannon-proof or not ; and that you would 
fix the sum beyond which we shall not go, for I must 
look to you for the expense. I have read that paragraph in Lord Loudoun's letter, which you were pleased 
to send me, over and over again, but am unable to comprehend its meaning. What scheme it was, that I was 
carrying into execution without waiting advice, I am at 
a loss to know, unless it was building the chain of forts 
along our frontiers, which I not only undertook conformably to an act of Assembly, and by your ow 
orders, but, with respect to the places, in pursuance of a 
council of war. If, under these circumstances, my 
conduct is responsible for the fate of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, it must be confessed, that I stand upon a tottering foundation indeed. I cannot charge my memory 
with either proposing, or intending, to draw the forts 
nearer Winchester. The garrison of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
it is true, I did wish to have removed to Cox's, which is 
nearer Winchester by twenty-five miles ; but not farther 
from the enemy, if a road were opened from thence to 
the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, which place is about twenty miles 
distant, and the same from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and more 
in the warriors' path. However, I see with much regret, 
that Lord Loudoun seems to have prejudged my proceedings, without being thoroughly informed of the 
springs and motives, that actuated my conduct. How 
far I have mistaken the means to recommend my services, I know not, but I am certain of this, that no man 
ever intended better, or studied the interest of his country with more zeal, than I have done ; and nothing gives 
me greater uneasiness and concern, than that his Lordship should have imbibed prejudices so unfavorable to 
my character, as to excite his belief that I was capable 
of doing any thing, " that will have a bad effect as to 
the Dominion, and no good appearance at home." 
</p><p>
As I had your permission to go down when his Lordship shall favor us with a visit, I desired Colonel Carlyle 
to inform me when he should pass through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, 
and I will set out accordingly. I hope nothing has intervened to alter this indulgence. It is a favor I should 
not have thought of asking, had I believed the service 
would suffer in my absence, but I am convinced it will 
not. And I cannot help saying, I believe we are the 
only troops on this continent, that are kept summer and 
winter to the severest duty, without the least respite or 
indulgence. 
</p><p>
The delay of the soldiers' clothes occasions unac 
countable murmurs and complaints, and I am very much 
afraid we shall have few men left, if they arrive not in 
a week or two. You would be astonished to see the 
naked condition of the poor wretches. How they possibly can subsist, much less work, in such severe 
weather, is not easy to conceive. Had we but blankets 
to give them, or any thing to defend them from the cold, 
they might perhaps be easy. 
</p><p>
I have formerly hinted to you our necessity for a 
speedy supply of cash, and have advised with the 
Speaker likewise, that he may not be unprepared. I 
purpose to send down by the 10th of next month. 
</p><p>
I cannot furnish a return of our strength as yet, 
because our scattered disposition hinders a regular 
discharge of the adjutant's duty. I am, &c.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, 19 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1756">1756</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You are no stranger, I presume, to the late resolutions 
of the Governor and Council, the consequence of which 
I meditate with great concern. We are ordered to reinforce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with one hundred men, and, to 
enable me to carry that number thither, all the stockade 
forts on the Branch are to be evacuated, and in course 
all the settlements abandoned, except what lie under the 
immediate protection of Captain Waggener's fort, the 
only place exempted in their resolve. Surely his Honor 
and the Council are not fully acquainted with the situation and circumstances of the unhappy frontiers, thus to 
expose so valuable a tract as the Branch, in order to 
support a fortification, in itself of very little importance 
to the inhabitants or the colony. The former order of 
Council would have endangered not only the loss of Fort 
Loudoun, the stores, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, but a general removal of the settlers of this vale, even to the Blue Ridge. 
This last has the same object in view, namely, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, and, to maintain it, the best lands in Virginia are 
laid open to the mercy of a cruel and inhuman enemy. 
</p><p>
These people have long struggled with the dangers 
of savage incursions, daily soliciting defence, and willing 
to keep their ground. To encourage them, all my little 
help has been administered, and they seemed satisfied 
with my intentions, resolving to continue while any probability of support remained. The disposition I had 
made of our small regiment gave general satisfaction to 
the settlements, and content began to appear everywhere. The necessary measures for provisions and 
stores were satisfactorily concerted, and every regulation 
established for the season. But the late order reverses, 
confuses, and incommodes every thing ; to say nothing 
of the extraordinary expense of carriage, disappointments, losses, and alterations, which must fall heavy on 
the country. Whence it arises, or why, I am truly ignorant; but my strongest representations of matters 
relative to the peace of the frontiers are disregarded, as 
idle and frivolous; my propositions and measures, as 
partial and selfish ; and all my sheerest endeavours for 
the service of my country are perverted to the worst 
purposes. My orders are dark, doubtful, and uncertain ; 
to-day approved, to-morrow condemned. Left to act 
and proceed at hazard, accountable for the consequences, and blamed without the benefit of defence, 
if you can think my situation capable of exciting the 
smallest degree of envy, or affording the least satisfaction, the truth is yet hidden from you, and you entertain 
notions very different from the reality of the case. 
However, I am determined to bear up under all these 
embarrassments some time longer, in hope of a better 
regulation on the arrival of Lord Loudoun, to whom I 
look for the future fate of Virginia. 
</p><p>
His Lordship, I think, has received impressions tending to my prejudice, by false representations of facts, if 
I may judge from a paragraph of one of his letters to 
the Governor, on which is founded the resolve to support <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> at all events. The severity of 
the season, and nakedness of the soldiers, are matters 
of much compassion, and give rise to infinite complaints. 
Nor is it possible to obviate them, unless the clothing come in immediately. You would be surprised how 
the poor creatures live, much more how they can do 
duty. Had we but blankets, they might be appeased 
for a little time. As we have not, I fear many will 
desert. 
</p><p>
I advised you formerly of our necessity for cash, and 
I now earnestly request it soon. I think of sending down 
by the 10th of next month, or sooner if agreeable. 
Please to inform me upon what I may depend, as our 
men are impatient, and with some reason, when without 
both money and clothes. I need not urge the advantage of small bills. We shall have occasion for at least 
six thousand pounds to clear us to the 1st of January. 
The commissary wants above half that sum to furnish 
his stock of provisions. The remainder will be exhausted in paying the troops. We ought always to 
have money in hand, as we are often reduced to many 
inconveniences by waiting for it, not to mention the expense and trouble.
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obliged and affectionate humble servant.

<p>
TO THE EARL OF LOUDOUN. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
The posture of affairs in this quarter is really melancholy, and the prospect was rendered more gloomy 
while there appeared no hopes of amendment; but, 
from the presence of your Lordship at this time in the 
Dominion, we conceive hopes of seeing these threaten 
ing clouds dispelled. 
</p><p>
The sums of money, which have been granted by this 
colony to carry on the war, have been very considerable ; and to reflect to what little purpose is matter of 
great concern, and will seem surprising to those, who 
are not acquainted with the causes, and the confusion 
with which all our affairs have hitherto been conducted, 
owing to our having no fixed object, nor pursuing any 
regular system, or plan of operation. 
</p><p>
As I have studied with attention and care the nature 
of the service, have been myself engaged in it from the 
beginning of the present broils, and an eyewitness to all 
the movements and various proceedings, I beg leave to 
offer a concise and candid account of our circumstances in their resolution, without alleging any other reason, than that it was in 
pursuance of Lord Loudoun's desire. 
</p><p>
It was not ascertained until too late, that the French 
were on the Ohio; or rather, that we could be persuaded they came there with a design to invade his 
Majesty's dominions. Nay, after I was sent out in December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1753">1753</a>, and brought undoubted testimony even 
from themselves of their avowed design, it was yet 
thought a fiction, and a scheme to promote the interest 
of a private company, even by some who had a share in 
the government. These unfavorable surmises caused 
great delays in raising the first men and money, and 
gave the active enemy time to take possession of the 
Fork of the Ohio (which they now call Duquesne), before we were in sufficient strength to advance thither, 
which has been the chief source of all our past and 
present misfortunes. For by this means, as the French 
got between us and our Indian allies, they fixed those 
in their interests, who were wavering, and obliged the 
others to neutrality, till the unhappy defeat of General 
Braddock. 
</p><p>
The troops under Colonel Dunbar going into quarters 
in July, the inactivity of the neighbouring colonies, and 
the incapacity of this, conspired to give the French 
great room to exult, and the Indians little reason to expect a vigorous offensive war on our side, and induced 
the defensive plan, which promised the greatest show 
of protection. This is an undeniable fact, as well as that 
all the Indians did not forsake the English interests, till 
three months after the battle of Monongahela, but actually waited to see what measures would be concerted 
to regain our losses, and afford them the protection we 
had but too liberally promised. 
</p><p>
Virginia, it is true, was not inactive all this time. On 
the contrary, she voted a handsome supply for raising men to carry on the war, or, more properly, to defend 
herself; matters being reduced to this extremity for 
want of assistance. But even in this she signally failed, 
and, as I apprehend, from the following causes. 
</p><p>
The men first levied to repel the enemy marched for 
the Ohio in the beginning of April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, without tents, 
without clothes, in short, without any conveniences to 
shelter them, in that remarkably cold and wet season, 
from the inclemency of the weather, or to make the 
service tolerably agreeable. In this state did they continue, notwithstanding, till the battle of the Meadows, in 
July following, never receiving in all that space any subsistence ; and they were very often under the greatest 
straits and difficulties for want of provisions. 
</p><p>
These things were productive of great murnrurings 
and discontent, and rendered the service so distasteful 
to the men, that, not being paid immediately upon coming in, they thought themselves bubbled, and that no 
reward for their services was ever intended. This 
caused desertion ; and the deserters, spreading over the 
country, recounting their sufferings and want of pay, 
which rags and poverty sufficiently testified, fixed in 
the mind of the populace such horrid impressions of the 
hardships they had encountered, that no arguments 
could remove these prejudices, or facilitate the recruiting service. 
</p><p>
This put the Assembly upon enacting a law to impress vagrants, which added to our difficulties, for, as 
these abandoned miscreants were compelled into the 
service, they embraced every opportunity to effect their 
escape, gave a loose to their vicious principles, and invented the most unheard-of stories to palliate desertion 
and gain compassion ; in which they not only succeeded, 
but obtained protection likewise. So that it was next 
to impossible, after this, to apprehend deserters, while 
the civil officers rather connived at their escape, than 
aided in securing them. 
</p><p>
Thus were affairs situated, when we were ordered, 
in September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>, to recruit our force to twelve hundred men. It is easy to conceive, under "these circumstances, why we did not fulfil the order, especially when 
the officers had not a sufficient allowance for this arduous task. We continued, however, using our endeavours 
until March following, without much success. 
</p><p>
The Assembly, meeting about that time, came to a 
resolution of augmenting our numbers to fifteen hundred 
men, by drafting the militia, who were to continue in 
the service until December only. By reason of a clause 
in the act exempting all those, who should pay ten 
pounds, our numbers were very little increased, one 
part of the people paying that sum, and many of the 
poorer sort absconding. This was not the only pernicious clause, for the funds arising from these forfeitures 
were thrown into the treasury ; whereas, had they been 
deposited in proper hands for recruiting, the money 
might have turned to good account. But a greater 
grievance still was the restraining of the forces from 
marching out of the colony, or acting offensively, and 
ordering them to build forts, and garrison them, along a 
frontier of more than three hundred miles in extent. 
How far they, or any like number, are equal to such a 
task, and how repugnant a defensive plan is to the true 
interest and welfare of the colony, I submit to any one 
to determine who will consider the following particulars. 
</p><p>
First, that erecting forts at greater distances than fifteen or eighteen miles, or a day's march asunder, and 
garrisoning them with less than eighty or a hundred 
men each, is not answering the intention ; because, if 
they are at a greater distance from each other, it is inconvenient for the soldiers to scout between them, and 
it gives the enemy full scope to make incursions without 
being discovered, until they have fallen on the inhabitants and committed ravages. And, after they are discovered, the time required, in assembling troops from 
forts more distant, prevents a pursuit being made in 
time, and allows the enemy to escape without danger 
into a country so mountainous and full of swamps and 
hollow ways covered with woods. Then, if garrisoned 
with less than eighty or a hundred men, the number is 
too small to afford detachments, that are not very liable 
to be cut off by the enemy, whose numbers in this close 
country can scarcely be known till they are proved. Indian parties are generally intermixed with some French, 
and are so dexterous at skulking, that their spies, lying 
about these small forts for some days and taking a prisoner, make certain discoveries of the strength of the garrison ; and then, upon observing a scouting party coming 
out, they will first cut it off, and afterwards attempt the 
fort. Instances of this have lately happened. 
</p><p>
Secondly, our frontiers are of such extent, that if the 
enemy were to make a formidable attack on one side, 
before the troops on the other could give assistance, 
they might overrun the country ; and it is not improbable, if they had a design on one part, that they would 
make a feint on the other. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the cost to the country in building these 
forts, and removing stores and provisions into them. 
</p><p>
Fourthly, where and when will this expense end? 
We may be assured, if we do not endeavour to remove 
the cause, w r e shall be as liable to the same incursions 
seven years hence as now ; indeed more so. Because, 
if the French are allowed to possess those lands in 
peace, they will have the entire command of the Indians, 
and grow stronger in their alliance ; while we, by our 
defensive schemes and pusillanimous behaviour, shall exhaust our treasury, reduce our strength, and become 
the contempt of these savage nations, who are every day 
enriching themselves with the plunder and spoils of our people. 
</p><p>
It will evidently appear from the whole tenor of nr 
conduct, but more especially from reiterated representations, how strongly I have urged the Governor and 
Assembly to pursue different measures, and tried to 
convince them, by all the reasonings I could offer, of the 
impossibility of covering so extensive a frontier from Indian incursions, without more force than Virginia can 
maintain. I have endeavoured to demonstrate, that it 
would require fewer men to remove the cause, than to 
prevent the effects, while the cause subsists. This, 
notwithstanding, as I before observed, was the measure 
adopted, and the plan under which we have acted for 
eight months past, with the disagreeable reflection of 
doing no essential service to our country, nor gaining 
honor to ourselves, or reputation to our regiment. However, under these disadvantageous restraints I must beg 
leave to say, that the regiment has not been inactive ; 
on the contrary, it has performed a vast deal of work, 
and has been very alert in defending the people. This 
will appear from the fact, that, notwithstanding we are 
more contiguous to the French and their Indian allies, 
and more exposed to their frequent incursions, than any 
of the neighbouring colonies, yet we have not lost half 
the number of inhabitants, that others have done, but 
considerably more soldiers in their defence. In the 
course of this campaign (since March, I mean, as we 
have had but one constant campaign, and one continued 
scene of action, from the time we first entered the service), our troops have been engaged in upwards of 
twenty skirmishes, and we have had near a hundred 
men killed and wounded. From a small regiment dispersed over the country, and acting upon the defensive, 
as ours does by order, this, I conceive, will not appear 
inconsiderable to those, who are in the least degree acquainted with the nature of this service, and the posture 
of our affairs ; however it may seem to chimney-corner 
politicians, thirsting for news, and expecting by every 
express to hear in what manner <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> is taken, 
and the garrison led away captive by our small numbers ; although we are restrained from making the attempt, were our hopes of success ever so rational. 
</p><p>
The next points, which I shall beg leave to mention, are our military laws and regulations. 
</p><p>
The first men raised, if I rightly remember, were under no law ; if any, the militia law, which was next of 
kin to none. Under this we remained a short time, 
and, by instilling the idea into the soldiers, who knew 
no better, that they were governed by the articles of 
war, we felt little inconvenience. The next campaign 
we were joined by the regulars, and made subject to 
their laws. After the regulars left us, the Assembly, as 
I before mentioned, passed an act in September following to raise twelve hundred men, and, in order I suppose to improve upon the act of Parliament, prepared a 
military code of their own, but such a one as could preserve no military discipline while it existed. This being 
represented by the most pressing and repeated remonstrances, the Assembly were induced to pass a bill in 
October following, for one year only, fixing the penalty 
of death for mutiny and desertion. But they took no 
cognizance of many other crimes, equally punishable 
by act of Parliament. So that no officer, or soldier, 
accused of cowardice, holding correspondence with the 
enemy, quitting a post, or sleeping upon it, and many 
other crimes of a capital dye, or pernicious tendency, 
could be legally tried. Neither was there any provision made for quartering or billeting soldiers, impressing wagons, and the like. 
</p><p>
But that which contributed the most towards rendering this law inconvenient and absurd, and at the same 
time to demonstrate that the Assembly fully intended to 
prevent any enterprise of their troops out of the colony, 
was a clause forbidding any courts -martial to sit out of 
it ; by which means all proceedings held at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> (in Maryland) were illegal, and we were obliged 
to remove to Virginia for the trial of offenders, or act 
contrary to law, and be open to prosecution. How 
then were we to behave upon a march of perhaps fifty, 
eighty, or a hundred miles beyond? These circumstances concurring to render the law ineffectual, induced me again to recommend an amendment, which 
I did with all the force and energy of argument I was 
master of. But no regard has hitherto been paid to my 
remonstrances. To what cause it is owing, I know not, 
unless to short sittings and hurry of business ; for I can 
conceive of no reason, why the Assembly should be against instituting rules for the regulation of their forces, 
of which long experience in established armies has fully 
evinced the necessity. But, to cut short the account, 
we are under no government at all, properly speaking. 
Indeed, there is a jumble of laws that have little meaning or design in them, but to make the command intricate, and to prevent offence to the civil powers, who 
are tenacious of liberty, and prone to censure and condemn all proceedings not strictly according to the law, 
not considering what cases may arise to render them necessary. 
</p><p>
Another grievance, to which this act subjects us, is 
the method prescribed to pay for deserters. Many 
of our deserters are apprehended in Maryland and 
Pennsylvania, and, for the sake of the reward, are 
brought to the regiment. But, instead of the reward, 
the persons thus bringing them in receive a certificate 
only, that they are entitled to two hundred pounds of 
tobacco. This certificate is to be presented to a Court 
of Claims, and they refer it to the Assembly. There it 
may perhaps remain two or three years before it is paid. 
This causes great dissatisfaction, and induces the illdisposed to aid, rather than prevent, the escape of 
soldiers. 
</p><p>
No regular provision is established for the maimed 
and wounded, which is discouraging, and grievously 
complained of. The soldiers justly observe, that the 
result of bravery is often a broken leg, arm, or incurable 
wound ; and when they are disabled, and no longer fit 
for service, they are discharged, and reduced to the necessity of begging from door to door, or of perishing 
through indigence. It is true, no instance of this kind 
has yet appeared. On the contrary, the Assembly have 
dealt generously by those unfortunate soldiers, who have 
met with this fate. But then, this provision is not yet established, nor in any manner compulsory, and a man 
may suffer in the interval of their sitting. 
</p><p>
After giving this short and true account of our military laws, and observing that even these, laws are now 
expired, I conceive there need but few -arguments to 
prove the difficulty of keeping soldiers under proper 
discipline, who know they are not punishable by law for 
the most atrocious crimes. How then is it to be wondered at, if mutiny, desertion, and all other irregularities 
should creep into a camp, or garrison, more, especially 
if we consider that hard duty, and want of clothes and 
of almost every necessary that renders a soldier's life 
comfortable and easy, are strong incentives, and, to 
go further, when these intolerable grievances are set to 
view in the most glaring point of light by a person, who, 
lost to all sense of honor and virtue, and building, I am 
sorry to say, upon a proclamation inviting the deserters 
from the Virginia Regiment to enlist into the Royal 
American Regiment, has made use of every artifice to 
represent the fatigues and hardships of our service, and 
the ease and conveniences of the other, to seduce them 
from their duty ? 
</p><p>
Want of clothing may be esteemed another principal 
grievance, which our soldiers have labored under. In 
the first twelve months of their service they received no 
clothing; but in March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, they were presented each 
with a suit made of thin, sleazy cloth without lining, and 
flannel waistcoats of an inferior sort. After that no 
others were sent for (although two pence stoppage was 
drawn from every man's pay, recruits npt excepted,) 
until repeated complaints and remonstrances from me, 
enforced in June last by a representation of many gentlemen of the Assembly, who had formed an association, 
and saw the disagreeable situation of the soldiers, induced the Committee, to whom those addresses were presented, to send for clothing. The clothes were to 
have been here by the middle of October, but no advice 
is received of them yet, which gives the soldiers some 
pretence to suspect they are deceived. It is to this irregular pay, and the causes aforementioned, that their 
late disobedience ought to be ascribed. For I can truly 
say, and confidently assert, that no soldiers ever were 
under better command than these were before. 
</p><p>
Perhaps it may be asked, by gentlemen not thoroughly 
acquainted with the nature of our service, why the officers do not see that their men's pay is more properly 
applied ? In answer I must beg leave to observe, that, 
after the soldiers have appropriated a part for purchasing reasonable and tit necessaries, the remainder is 
barely sufficient to keep them in shoes, owing, in the 
first place, to the very great consumption the service occasions, and, in the next, to the exorbitant price, which 
this article bears. I have known a soldier go upon 
command with a new pair of shoes, which perhaps have 
cost him from seven shillings and sixpence to ten shillings, and return without any ; so much do they wear in 
wading creeks, fording rivers, and clambering mountains 
covered with rocks. 
</p><p>
As great a grievance as any I have mentioned is yet 
unnoticed, and that is the present regulation of the militia ; but a representation of this matter will come better 
and more properly from others. 
</p><p>
To point out all the causes, which combine to make 
our service infinitely hard and disagreeable, would swell 
these observations into a volume, and require time, and 
a more able pen than mine. But there are yet some 
things, that should be mentioned. 
</p><p>
An ill-judged economy is shown in raising men. We 
are either insensible of danger, till it breaks upon our 
heads, or else, through mistaken 'notions of economy, evade the expense, till the blow is struck, and then run 
into an extreme of raising militia. These, after an age, 
as it were, is spent in assembling them, come up, make 
a noise for a time, oppress the inhabitants, and then return, leaving the frontiers unguarded as before. And 
this plan is pursued, notwithstanding former experience 
convinces us, if reason did not, that the French and Indians are watching their opportunity, when we are lulled 
into fatal security, unprepared for resisting an attack, to 
muster their forces to invade the country. By ravaging 
one part they terrify another, and retreat when our militia assemble, but repeat the stroke as soon as they are 
dispersed, sending down parties in the interim to discover our motions, procure intelligence, and sometimes 
to divert our troops. Such an invasion we may expect 
in March, if measures to prevent it are neglected, as 
they hitherto have been. 
</p><p>
The want of tools occasions insurmountable difficulties in carrying on our works, either offensive or defensive. 
Cartridge-paper is an article not to be met with in Virginia. 
</p><p>
And now, before I conclude, I must beg leave to add, 
that my unwearied endeavours are inadequately rewarded. The orders I receive are full of ambiguity. I 
am left, like a wanderer in the wilderness, to proceed 
at hazard. I am answerable for consequences, and 
blamed, without the privilege of defence. This, my 
Lord, I beg leave to declare, is at present my situation. 
Therefore, it is not to be wondered at, if, under such 
peculiar circumstances, I should be sick of a service, 
which promises so little of a soldier's reward. I have 
long been satisfied of the impossibility of continuing 
in this service, without loss of honor. Indeed, I was 
fully convinced of it before I accepted the command the 
second time, seeing the cloudy prospect before me ; and I did for this reason reject the offer, until I was ashamed 
any longer to refuse, not caring to expose my character 
to public censure. The solicitations of the country 
overcame my objections, and induced me to accept it. 
</p><p>
Another reason has of late operated to continue me 
in the service until now, and that is, the dawn of hope 
that arose, when I heard your Lordship was destined 
by his Majesty for the important command of his armies 
in America, and appointed to the government of his dominion of Virginia. Hence it was, that I drew my 
hopes, and fondly pronounced your Lordship our patron. Although I had not the honor to be known to 
your Lordship, yet your name was familiar to my ear, 
on account of the important services rendered to his 
Majesty in other parts of the world. 
</p><p>
Ever since our defeat at the Meadows, and behaviour 
under General Braddock, we have been tantalized, nay, 
bid to expect most sanguinely a better establishment, 
and have waited in tedious expectation of seeing this 
accomplished. The Assembly, it is true, have, I believe, done every thing in their power to bring this 
about; first, by soliciting his Honor, the LieutenantGovernor, to address his Majesty; and next, by addressing his Majesty themselves in favor of their regiment. What success these addresses have met with, I am yet ignorant. With regard to myself, I cannot 
forbear adding, that, had General Braddock survived 
his unfortunate defeat, I should have met with preferment agreeable to my wishes. I had his promise to 
that purpose, and I believe that gentleman was too sincere and generous to make unmeaning offers, where no 
favors were asked. General Shirley was not unkind in 
his promises, but he has gone to England. 
</p><p>
I do not know, my Lord, in what light this short and 
disinterested relation may be received ; but it is offered with the utmost candor and submission. It contains no 
misrepresentations, nor aggravated statement of facts, nor unjust reflections. 
</p><p>
Virginia is a country young in war, and, till the breaking out of these disturbances, has remained in the most 
profound and tranquil peace, never studying war nor 
warfare. It is not, therefore, to be imagined, that she 
can fall into proper measures at once. All that can be 
expected at her hands she cheerfully offers, the 
sinews of war, and these only want your Lordship's 
ability and experience to be properly applied and directed. 
</p><p>
Finally, my Lord, how to apologize for assuming a 
freedom, which must at any rate give you trouble, I 
know not, unless an ardent zeal to serve my country, 
and a steady attachment to her interests, and to the 
honor of arms, shall plead an excuse, till I am so happy 
as to have an opportunity of testifying in person how 
much I admire your Lordship's character, and with 
what profound respect I have the honor to be, &c.

TO RICHARD WASHINGTON, MERCHANT, LONDON. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 15 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
After so long silence it may be expected, that I 
should introduce this letter with an apology for my 
seeming neglect. I own, Sir, it is necessary to urge 
something in my defence, and what can be so proper as 
the truth? 
</p><p>
I have been posted, then, for twenty months past 
upon our cold and barren frontiers, to perform, I think I 
m#y say, impossibilities ; that is, to protect from the cruel 
incursions of a crafty, savage enemy a line of inhabitants, 
of more than three hundred and fifty miles in extent, 
with a force inadequate to the task. By this means I 
am become in a manner an exile, and seldom informed 
of those opportunities, which I might otherwise embrace, 
of corresponding with my friends. 
</p><p>
Experience has convinced every thinking man in this 
colony, that we must bid adieu to peace and safety 
whilst' the French are allowed to possess the Ohio, and 
to practise their arts among the numerous tribes of Indian nations that inhabit those regions, and that it must 
be attended with an expense infinitely greater to defend 
our possessions, as they ought to be defended against 
the skulking enemy, than to remove the cause of our 
groundless fears, by the reduction of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
</p><p>
had no reason to expect a warm friend in the Governor of Virginia at the 
councils in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. He did not fail, therefore, to embrace the opportunity, reluctantly as it had been granted, of being present and attending 
personally to the interests of his regiment, and to affairs in which he was 
so deeply concerned. He was consulted by Lord Loudoun, in regard to 
the future disposition of the forces on the frontiers of the southern colonies. 
But after all, he was not successful in his wish to have the Virginia regiment put upon the same footing as the regular army, and to obtain King's 
commissions for himself and his officers. 
</p><p>
Yet, from what strange causes I know not, no attempt 
this season will be made, I fear, to destroy this hold of 
the barbarians, for they deserve no better name, who 
have become a terror to three populous colonies. Virginia may justly say, that she was always willing to furnish her full proportion of men and money for this 
desirable end; and, I think I may venture to affirm, 
that there never was, and I verily believe never will be, 
a more favorable time than the present for an enterprise 
Of this kind, while the enemy's troops are doubtless 
drawn off to the northward, to defend themselves at 
home against the more formidable attack of Lord Loudoun. 
</p><p>
I have now to add, that I am so little acquainted with 
the business relative to my private affairs, that I can 
scarce give you any information concerning it. I know 
that I ought to have some tobacco, and that it ought to 
be stripped. I have begged the favor of two persons to 
do this for me, and I desired them to write you in my 
behalf, and draw for sundry things, of which I am in 
want ; but whether any part or all of this has been done, 
I know not. I shall, therefore, desire these two things 
of you ; first, that you will put yourself to no real inconvenience in forwarding goods to a greater amount than 
my remittance, because I by no means intended to be 
troublesome, when I solicited your correspondence ; 
and, secondly, that whatever goods you may send 
me, where the prices are not absolutely limited, you 
will let them be fashionable, neat, and good in their several kinds. Enclosed is a list of sundries, which I 
should be glad to receive agreeably to these directions. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, 
Your affectionate friend, and obedient servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter by express, of the 5th instant, I fear has 
fallen into the hands of the common enemy, for I never 
have seen it. The other of the 7th I this day received; 
1 and being exceedingly embarrassed to come at your intentions, and really at a loss to know in what manner to 
act, in such perplexed and difficult circumstances, I 
called a council of officers to my aid. The result of 
their advice you will find in the enclosed. 
</p><p>
It will not be in my power to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> by 
the 22 d, as your Honor desires ; but as soon after as I 
can, I certainly will. I shall leave orders with Colonel 
Stephen to march this garrison to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, as 
soon as it is relieved, which cannot be before this express may return, and then your further orders may be 
received. We have no advice of Dagworthy's inarching, though orders were sent to him. 
</p><p>
I shall order all the country's stores to be carried to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, and the two companies on Patterson's 
Creek to be posted on the Branch, to complete the 
number that was designed for that place. I have ordered a particular return of the provisions to be made 
out, and Colonel Stephen to take Captain Dagworthy's 
receipt for the quantity left. 
</p><p>
We have been at a good deal of unavoidable expense 
and trouble to furnish the Indians with such things as 
they wanted. Some hostile Indians killed two Catawbas on Thursday last, at about one hundred and fifty 
yards from the fort, and seventy from a sentry, and 
made their escape, though pursued by other Catawbas 
and near two hundred men. And the day before yesterday, two soldiers were killed and a third taken prisoner, as they were coming to this place from the fort 
below. The rest of the party, being ten in number, 
with Captain Waggener among them, made their escape. 
</p><p>
The enclosed remonstrance I have just received, and 
think it expedient to send it to your Honor, that you 
may know the temper and disposition of the troops. 
As I expect to be with you in two or three days after 
the express, I think it needless to add any thing but an apology for the incoherence of this letter. The Indians 
are all around teazing and perplexing me for one thing or another, so that I scarce know what I write. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 30 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We receive fresh proofs every day of the bad direction of our Indian affairs. It is not easy to tell what 
expenses have arisen on account of these Indians, how 
dissatisfied they are, and how gloomy the prospect of 
pleasing them appears, while we pursue our present 
system of management. 
</p><p>
I therefore beg leave to propose a plan, which I know 
is exactly conformable to the French policy, and which 
may, if properly executed, be a means of retrieving our 
lost credit with these people, and prove of infinite service to the country. The French have a proper person 
appointed to the direction of these affairs, who makes it 
his sole business to study the dispositions of the Indians, 
and the art of pleasing them. This person is invested 
with power to treat with and reward them for every piece of service, and thus, by timely presents on suitable 
occasions, to obtain very great advantages. There is 
always a store of goods committed to his care to answer 
these purposes, and no other person is suffered to meddle with it ; by which means the whole business is 
thrown into one channel, and it thereby becomes easy 
and regular. Whereas, with us it is every body's business, and no one's, to afford supplies. Every person attempts to please, and few succeed in it, because one 
promises this, and another that, and few can perform 
any thing, but are obliged to shuffle and put the Indians 
off, to get rid of their importunities. 
</p><p>
Hence they accuse us of perfidy and deceit. I could 
recapitulate a great number of their reproachful complaints, if I judged it necessary to confirm what I have 
already advanced. But I believe, Sir, you are convinced from what you have seen, that there can be no 
deception in my story. Therefore, I shall remark with 
candor, freedom, and submission, that, unless some person is appointed to manage the Indian affairs of this 
colony, under the direction of the Governor, or the 
southern agent,  a vast expense and but a little advantage will accrue from the coming of the Indians among 
us. And I know of no person so well qualified for an 
undertaking of this sort as the bearer, Captain Gist. He 
has had extensive dealings with the Indians, is in great 
esteem among them, well acquainted with their manners 
and customs, indefatigable, and patient, most excellent qualities where Indians are concerned. As to his 
capacity, honesty, and zeal, I dare venture to engage. 
If he should be appointed to this duty, or, if this plan 
should take effect, I dare say you will judge it advisable to send for a large assortment of that species of goods 
best suited for carrying on the abovementioned business. 
</p><p>
Bullen, a Catawba warrior, has been proposing a plan 
to Captain Gist for bringing in the Creek and Chickasaw Indians. If such a scheme could be effected, by 
the time we shall march for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, it would be 
a glorious undertaking, and worthy of the man.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
A person of a readier pen, and having more time, 
than myself, might amuse you with the vicissitudes, 
which have happened in the Indian affairs since Mr. Atkin came up. I acknowledge my incompetency, and 
therefore shall only observe, that the Indians have been 
pleased and displeased oftener than they ought to have 
been; and that they are gone off (that party under 
Warhatalie, I mean,) in different ways, and with far different views ; one company southwardly to their nation ; 
and another northwardly to treat with the Pennsylvanians, contrary to the sentiments of Mr. Atkin, who 
has, I believe, sent to forbid any conference to be held with them. 
</p><p>
Major Lewis is returned with part of the Indians, 
that went out with him, in consequence of their having 
taken only eight days' provisions with them. He was 
unable to prevail with those savages to take more. One 
party of twenty, with ten soldiers, is gone towards Fort 
Duquesne, under Captain Spotswood ; and another 
party of fifteen, with five soldiers, under Lieutenant Baker, who are to proceed towards Logstown. God 
send them success and a safe return. 
</p><p>
Unless you will interest yourself in sending money to 
discharge the public debts, I must inevitably suffer very 
considerably, as the country people all think me pledged 
to them, let what will happen. They are grown very 
clamorous, and will be more than ever incensed, if there 
should come an inadequate sum, and that sum be appropriated to the payment of the soldiers. 
</p><p>
I am convinced it would give pleasure to the Governor to hear that I was involved in trouble, however 
undeservedly, such are his dispositions towards me.

I am,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
A scouting party, consisting of five soldiers and fifteen Cherokee Indians, who were sent out the 20th 
ultimo towards the Ohio, under Lieutenant Baker, returned the 8th instant to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with five 
scalps, and a French officer, prisoner, having killed two 
other officers of the same party. Mr. Baker met with 
this party (ten French, three officers) on the head of 
Turtle Creek, twenty miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, the 
day after they had parted with fifty Shawanese Indians 
returning from war, and would have killed and made 
prisoners of them all, had not the death of the Indian chief, who was killed in that skirmish, prevented their 
pursuing them. The name of the officer taken, according to his own account, is Velistre ; and of those killed, 
Lasosais and St. Oure ; all ensigns. 
</p><p>
The commandant at Duquesne and its dependencies 
is Delignery, a knight of the military order of St. Louis, 
and captain of a company of detached troops from the 
marine. This officer likewise says, that the garrison at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> consists of six hundred French and two 
hundred Indians. We sustained on our side the loss 
of the brave Swallow warrior, and one other Indian 
wounded, whom the party brought in on a bier, with no 
other sustenance for the last four days, than such as 
they derived from wild onions. 
</p><p>
Captain Spots wood, with ten soldiers and twenty Indians, who went out at the same time, but to a different 
place, is not yet come in, nor any news of him ; which 
makes me uneasy. , 
</p><p>
Our Assembly have granted a further sum of eighty 
thousand pounds for the service of the ensuing year, 
and have agreed, I believe, to complete the regiment 
of this colony to twelve hundred men, besides three 
companies of rangers, of one hundred men each. Our 
strength, since the detachment embarked for Carolina, 
amounts only to four hundred and twenty rank and file ; 
and these much weakened, by the number of posts 
we hold. Governor Dinwiddie is apprehensive, that he 
shall not be able to provide arms for all these men, and 
he desired me to advise with you thereupon. 
</p><p>
Duty and inclination equally induce me to communicate all remarkable occurrences to you, and I shall be 
punctual in doing so. At present, however, I have only 
to add, that I am, with very great respect, your most 
obedient humble servant.

SIR, 
</p><p>
This instant the enclosed letters came to my hands. 
I have not lost a moment's time in transmitting them to 
you, as I look upon the intelligence to be of the utmost 
importance. If the enemy are coming down in such 
numbers, and with such a train of artillery, as we are bid 
to expect, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> must inevitably fall into 
their hands, as no timely efforts can be made to relieve 
the garrison. I send you a copy of a council of war 
held upon this occasion. The advice I intend to pursue, 
until I receive orders. It is morally certain, that the next 
object, which the French have in view, is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 
and that is yet in a very untenable posture. They have 
no roads for carriages into any other province, except 
through this ; and there lies a quantity of stores here, belonging to his Majesty and to this colony, very much 
exposed and unguarded. 
</p><p>
I shall not take up your time, with a tedious detail. 
You will be a sufficient judge of the present situation 
of affairs, from the circumstances already related. I 
have written to the commanding officers of Fairfax, 
Prince William, and Culpeper counties, (a copy of the 
letters I enclose,) requesting them to march part of their 
militia to this place immediately, that no time may be 
lost. You may be assured, Sir, I shall make the best 
defence I can, if attacked. I am, &,e.

P. S. I have written to Colonel Stanwix an account

council of war.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Yours of the 18th from the camp at Carlisle I received about noon this day, when, in company with his 
Majesty's agent for Indian affairs, I was examining the 
French prisoner brought to this place by Lieutenant 
Baker and the Cherokee Indian. A copy of this examination I herewith enclose. You will find, Sir, from 
the tenor of his answers, that a large body of Indians 
was hourly expected at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, and that, although there was not (if his intelligence is to be literally 
credited, and surely it is not) a train of artillery fit for 
such an expedition ; yet this might have been brought 
by those three hundred men, who arrived there after he 
left the place. 
</p><p>
It is altogether evident, if the Indian accounts may be 
relied on, that the French are bringing howitzers with 
them for the easier reduction of the place, if they should 
attack us. For, say they, your guns are but muskets, 
compared with those the French have with them. 
Theirs will admit a fawn in the muzzle, while yours will 
not take in a man's fist. To any person, in the least 
degree acquainted with the mountainous country about 
our settlements, it is clear, that the French can bring 
artillery along no other road, than that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, without spending immense 
time in mending one. I conceive that the garrison at 
Fort Augusta has been very negligent and inactive, not to discover the enemy sooner. On the other hand, a 
blazed path in the eyes of an Indian is a large road ; for 
he does not distinguish, without a close inspection, between a track which will admit of carriages, and a road 
sufficient for Indians to march in. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are only my own sentiments, and I submit them to your better judgment. We very well 
know, that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> 
there is a plain road already made, and bridges also. I 
shall, however, continue to pursue every means in my 
power to gain the earliest and best intelligence of the 
approaches of the enemy, and shall transmit it forthwith to you. I have sent Major Lewis fifty miles in 
advance of this place, with orders to keep out constant 
spies for intelligence, and to lose no time in forwarding 
it to me. 
</p><p>
We have received nothing new from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> since the 16th. The Indians, who brought the 
first news, imagine, that some of Spotswood's party are 
yet watching the motions of the enemy. On the contrary, I apprehend they are all cut off; for a man, who 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> the 16th, says, that the woods 
appear to be quite alive with hostile Indians, who show 
themselves openly in the day. This is unusual with 
them, unless they are strong. 
</p><p>
We work on this Fort, both night and day, intending 
to make it tenable against the worst event. Mr. Croghan and others write you by this express, and will no 
doubt be more explicit on Indian affairs, than I can pretend to be, and to them I refer. I am, &,c.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your two favors 
both of the 22d instant. We were reinforced, upon the 
late alarm, by one hundred and seventy militia from the 
adjacent counties, one half of them unarmed, and the 
whole without ammunition or provisions. 
</p><p>
Had you, Sir, in consequence of Captain Beall's  
suggestions, ordered me to reinforce <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 
with part of my regiment, I should have given you proof 
of my willingness to obey your commands, by a speedy 
compliance with them ; but since you are so kind as to 
leave it discretionary with me, I freely confess, that I 
cannot entertain any thoughts of parting with the fewsoldiers I have, to strengthen a place that now seems to 
be in no actual danger. Nor can I help observing, that 
I think it a little odd in Captain Beall, after having received subsequent notice of the fallacy of his first intelligence, to intimate that it was reasonable to reinforce 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, at the expense of Virginia, which has 
a frontier to defend thirty times the extent of that of 
Maryland, and this frontier left solely to the protection 
of her few regular troops,
</p><p>
I flatter myself, that the account of an expected attack upon Fort Augusta [in Pennsylvania], will prove 
more favorable, than Colonel Weiser imagines ; for I 
have no conception, that a road fit for carriages can be 
cut within ten miles of a fort, without its being discovered by the garrison. 
</p><p>
The friendship and assistance of the Cherokees are 
well worth cultivating. For my own part, I think them 
indispensably necessary in our present circumstances, 
and am sorry to find such unseasonable delays in bringing them amongst us. Since Captain Croghan left this 
place, Antasity, an Indian warrior of that nation, with 
twenty-seven followers, has arrived here. He brings an 
account of many more that are coming ; but whether 
they will wait for Mr. Atkin's passport, or come on with 
their own, I know not. 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Governor Dinwiddie, in which he desires me to present his compliments 
to you. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My former letters would inform you how little share I had in confining the Indians to the public jail at this place.
</p><p>
Mr. Atkin, in his Majesty's name, applied to me as 
commanding officer for aid to secure these people, 
which I thereupon rendered, but not without first 
representing the consequences, that might and in some 
measure really did happen. This step was no sooner 
taken, than the Cherokees in town, about twenty-two in 
number, despatched a runner to inform their people, 
that the English had fallen upon their brethren, and desired that they (the Cherokees) would stand upon their 
defence. Another runner, you know, went to Carlisle 
to inform the warriors there, who returned fully resolved 
to rescue the prisoners, or die in the attempt. The 
former they effected, and were so enraged with Mr. Atkin, that they would hold no conference with him the 
next day, when he sent to desire it, till they had first 
been with me for information. I took great pains to 
convince them, that it was a mistake, and happily succeeded. They agreed to send an Indian to their nation 
with an express, whom I might procure, to prevent a 
massacre of all the traders and white people there, 
which they looked upon as inevitable, unless timely 
measures were taken to prevent it. 
</p><p>
Out of the great number of drafts that have deserted 
from us, we have been able to apprehend twenty -two ; 
of whom two were hanged on Thursday last. The eight companies now remaining in Virginia are completed to about eighty men each, rank and file, four 
commanding officers, four sergeants, and two drummers, 
and are all marched to the several posts assigned them. 
The commission, which I have received from Governor Dinwiddie, to hold general courts-martial, is very 
long, and rather a repetition of the act. I should be 
obliged, if you would let me know whether this be right 
or not. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The drafts from Lunenburg are arrived, to the num 
ber of sixteen, which does not replace the soldiers, that 
have deserted since my last. The drafts, when they 
were divided among the eight companies in July, completed them to eighty-six rank and file ; and there remained over and above forty workmen, whom I detained 
at this place, as mentioned in a former letter. 
</p><p>
What the strength of the companies is just at this 
time, I am no more able to say, not knowing what casualties may have happened since, than I am to send your 
Honor a return of the regiment, which is impossible till 
I get my returns from the several out-posts ; and that, I 
believe your Honor must be sensible, is difficult and 
precarious, dispersed as the regiment is. I have given 
express orders, however, that those returns shall be 
made to me as regularly as the nature of things will admit, and I shall not be wanting in my duty to forward 
them, nor shall I delay to send the companies' size-rolls, 
when they come to my hands. 
</p><p>
The enclosed is a copy of a report made to me by two officers, who were instructed to inspect the provisions at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>. Mr. Kennedy, who was 
entrusted with the care of these provisions, is now there 
repacking and pickling them ; and when he has finished, 
I shall endeavour to do the best I can with them, but 
despair of turning them to the least advantage. 
</p><p>
A letter, which I received a few days ago from Captain Waggener advises, that the enemy appeared upon 
the Branch, not far from his neighbourhood, their numbers uncertain, killed several men, and captured others, 
without his being able to meet with them. On Sunday 
last, a small party of five Cherokees, who came here a 
few days ago, set out to war. 
</p><p>
Your Honor having asked my opinion concerning recruiting, I shall give it candidly as follows. I believe, 
unless we are permitted to enlist servants, we should 
spend much time to little purpose in this service ; such 
a spirit of opposition prevails in one sort of people, and 
so little spirit of any kind in another. I never thought, 
in the most distant degree, of recruiting for the additional companies, till the others were complete ; nor 
should I have mentioned that subject, had I not supposed it was required by the act of Assembly. 
</p><p>
As you were pleased to leave it to my discretion to 
punish or pardon the criminals, I have resolved on the 
latter, since I find example of so little weight, and since 
those poor unhappy criminals have undergone no small 
pain of body and mind, in a dark prison, closely ironed. 
</p><p>
I have filled up a commission for Sergeant Flint, and 
will send it to him by the first safe conveyance. Colonel Stanwix, I am told (the truth of which I doubt), has 
marched to the northward. I have had no account from 
him these four weeks. 
</p><p>
Mr. Boyd, to whom I have spoken on the matter, 
conceives, that there will be no money left for contingent expenses, when he has paid the troops. I shall 
do as your Honor directs, with regard to escorting 
Mr. Boyd to Augusta, and ordering officers to wait upon 
him at this place, however inconvenient it may prove to 
the service. 
</p><p>
Nothing remarkable has happened, for which reason 
I have nothing in particular to add. I must beg leave, 
however, before I conclude, to observe, in justification 
of my own conduct, that it is with pleasure I receive reproof, when reproof is due, because no person can be 
readier to accuse me, than I am to acknowledge an 
error, when I am guilty of one ; nor more desirous of 
atoning for a crime, when I am sensible of having committed it. But, on the other hand, it is with concern I 
remark, that my best endeavours lose their reward, and 
that my conduct, although I have uniformly studied to 
make it as unexceptionable as I could, does not appear to 
you in a favorable point of light. Otherwise your Honor 
would not accuse me of loose behaviour and remissness of duty, in matters where, I believe, I have rather 
exceeded than fallen short of it. This, I think, is evidently the case in speaking of Indian Affairs at all, after 
being instructed in very express terms, "not to have 
any concern with or management of Indian affairs" 
This has caused me to forbear mentioning the Indians 
in any of my letters to you of late, and to leave the misunderstanding, which you speak of, between Mr. Atkin 
and the Indians, to be related by him, knowing that he 
maintained a correspondence with you on matters relative to his office. But, with regard to the accounts, 
when he would have nothing to do with them, and 
when I was hourly importuned for the payment, and 
knew I had not the means, what could I do less than 
promise the people, that I would recommend their cases 
to your Honor, in hopes that you would appoint a person, in whom you could confide, to take in and pay off 
their accounts, as I always looked upon it to be a duty 
distinct from mine, and therefore was unwilling to intermeddle in the affair? 
</p><p>
I really thought it unnecessary to say more, than that 
" the detachment destined for Augusta had marched," 
because your Honor gave me a copy of the result of the 
council held at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which directed one hundred and fifty men to be posted at Dickinson's, and one 
hundred at Vass's, which direction I observed, and I 
thought it would be sufficiently understood when I 
wrote as above, 
</p><p>
I should have acknowledged the receipt of the arms, 
had they come to hand, but they were not arrived when 
my last was written ; which obliged me to disarm the 
men remaining here, in order to supply those who 
marched, rather than detain them, as I had sent wagons 
to Falmouth to bring the arms from thence. However, 
if I have erred in these points, I am sorry for it, and 
shall endeavour for the future to be as particular and 
satisfactory, in my accounts of these things, as possible. 
</p><p>
I am, with due respect, 
Your Honor's most obedient, humble servant.

TO GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 17 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 2d instant came safe to hand, and Jenkins's sickness has prevented my answering it sooner. 
</p><p>
I apprehend, that thirteen of the twenty -nine drafts 
from Lunenburg have deserted, as sixteen only have arrived here, and I have no accounts of any more being 
on their march. Your Honor may observe by the enclosed list of deserters, all of whom have left the regiment since the last return, and after having received 
their clothes, arms, and bounty money, how prevalent 
still is that infamous practice among the dastardly drafts, 
especially at this garrison, where I indulge them in 
every thing but idleness, and in that I cannot, the nature 
of the work requiring the contrary. Lenity, so far from 
producing its desired effects, rather emboldens them in 
these villanous acts. One of those condemned to be 
hanged, deserted immediately upon receiving his pardon. In short, they tire my patience, and almost weary 
me to death. The expense of pursuing them is very 
considerable, and to suffer them to escape, without pursuit, is giving up the point, although we have had but 
little success of late. 
</p><p>
The uncertain and difficult communication with the 
out-posts must apologize for my not sending you a return of our strength for August. The second month 
will always be far advanced, before I can get in the returns of the preceding, as the month must be first expired, before the returns can be made out, and then 
some of them are to come two hundred and fifty miles, and great part of that distance through an uninhabited country. 
</p><p>
If special messengers are always sent with these returns, it will be a considerable expense. I should therefore be glad if your Honor would be pleased to direct, 
whether they are to be sent to me by express, or by 
the best casual conveyance. In the one case, as I before said, there must be a constant expense, and in the 
other, great uncertainty. By the enclosed return for 
July, you will see that our total strength amounted to 
six hundred and ninety-nine ; but, as many changes and 
casualties happened in that month, by reason of the 
drafts joining, deserting, and the companies not being 
properly formed, this return will, I apprehend, appear 
confused and irregular. Our present strength, I think, 
is about seven hundred. Major Lewis did, as he wrote 
you, march from this place with about one hundred and 
forty men only ; but then Captain Woodward, who also 
marched at the same time, with his company from the 
South Branch, joined him at Dickinson's; and these 
troops, with the men under Captain Hogg, formed a 
body of something more than two hundred and fifty 
men, agreeably to the number appointed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
for the forts at Dickinson's and Vass's. 
</p><p>
I never expected, nor ever desired, that there should 
be an addition made to the number of those persons 
appointed to transact public business, much less that 
there should be one to settle every little affair. I only 
humbly proposed, that, as Captain Gist was empowered 
with your Honor's approbation to manage the Indian 
affairs here, and as he is to be paid for that duty by 
this colony, he should, as a more proper person than 
myself, take in and adjust the accounts against the Indians, so often mentioned, since it cannot reasonably be 
supposed that I, who am stripped of the help I once 
was allowed, and told that I should be freed from these 
things in consequence, can turn my hands and thoughts 
to such a multiplicity of business, as naturally arises ou 
of the variety of occurrences, occasioned by our scat 
tered and detached situation and the many extraneou 
concerns of the Indians. Every person, who sees ho 
I am employed, will readily testify, that very little re 
creation falls to my lot. Nevertheless, if it is yo 
order, that I shall collect these accounts, I will do it 
the best manner I am able, and that with cheerfulness ; 
but it will be some time before it can be accomplished, 
as I have turned them off once. 
</p><p>
The Indian chiefs, before they departed for their nation, warmly solicited me for some drums ; and, as I 
had none but those belonging to the regiment, which 
could not be spared, I was obliged to promise them, 
that I would acquaint your Honor with their request, 
that you might, if you thought proper, provide them 
against their return. 
</p><p>
Since my last, the enemy came to the Branch, where 
they killed four men, wounded one, captured a man and 
a woman, and burned some grain, notwithstanding the 
utmost efforts of the troops, who are constantly scouting. 
The people in that quarter are terribly frightened by 
this last irruption, and I fear can hardly be prevented 
from deserting that valuable settlement. 
</p><p>
When your Honor shall be pleased to order the vacancy, occasioned by the death of Captain Spotswood, 
to be filled up with the name of Captain M c Neil, there 
will be room for a lieutenant ; and should you bestow the 
commission on Mr. Fairfax, I shall take it infinitely kind, 
if you will oblige me so far as to send it immediately 
from yourself to that gentleman. Although I esteem 
him greatly on account of his father, for whose memory 
and friendship I shall ever retain a most grateful regard, 
yet, making him lieutenant over so many ensigns of long 
standing, will occasion great confusion in the corps, and 
bring censure on me ; for the officers will readily conceive, that my friendship and partiality for the family 
were the causes of it. If Mr. Fairfax would accept of 
an ensigncy, the matter might pretty easily be accommodated. The letter under cover to Colonel Fairfax is 
not yet come to hand. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing yet from Colonel Stanwix ; but soon shall, as I wrote to him a few days ago, and expect his answer. 
</p><p>
As we have not at this time either commissary or assistant here, it is not in my power to send a return of 
the provisions with any tolerable exactness. But I do 
not doubt, that Mr. Rutherford, our acting commissary, 
who is now below, has satisfied your Honor fully in 
this particular ; if he has not, I will take care to do it 
in my next. 
</p><p>
I doubt not your Honor will see the necessity of making an agreement with the contractors, for furnishing the 
Indians with provisions; otherwise they will take no 
concern in this matter. I conceive they are allowed a 
certain amount for each soldier, that shall be returned, 
and that Indians are included. If not, no persons will 
supply them on the same terms, that they do soldiers, 
for Indians eat and w r aste triple as much as soldiers.

I am your Honor's, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
A letter of the 22d ultimo, from Captain Peachey, 
came to my hands the other day, the contents of which 
are herewith forwarded. I should take it infinitely 
kind, if your Honor would please to inform me, whether 
a report of this nature was ever made to you ; and, in 
that case, who was the author of it ? 
</p><p>
It is evident, from a variety of circumstances, and especially from the change in your Honor's conduct towards me, that some person, as well inclined to detract, 
but better skilled in the art of detraction, than the author of the above stupid scandal, has made free with my 
character. For I cannot suppose, that malice so absurd, so barefaced, so diametrically opposite to truth, to 
common policy, and, in short, to every thing but villany, as the above is, could impress you with so ill an opinion of my honor and honesty. 
</p><p>
If it be possible, that Colonel C., for my belief is 
staggered, not being conscious of having given the least 
cause to any one, much less to that gentlemen, to reflect 
so grossly, I say, if it be possible, that Colonel C. 
could descend so low as to be the propagator of this 
story, he must either be vastly ignorant of the state of 
affairs in this county at that time, or else he must 
suppose, that the whole body of inhabitants had combined with me, in executing the fraud. Or why did 
they, almost to a man, forsake their dwellings in the 
greatest terror and confusion ; so that, while one half of 
them sought shelter in paltry forts, of their own building, the other fled to the adjacent counties for refuge, 
numbers of them even to Carolina, from whence they 
have never returned 1 
</p><p>
These are facts well known ; but not better known, 
than that these wretched people, while they lay pent up 
in forts, destitute of the common support of life (having 
in their precipitate flight forgotten, or rather been unable to secure, any kind of necessaries), did despatch 
messengers of their own (thinking I had not represented 
their miseries in the piteous manner they deserved), 
with addresses to your Honor and the Assembly, praying relief. And did I ever send any alarming account, 
without also sending the original papers, or the copies, 
which gave rise to it? 
</p><p>
That I have foibles, and perhaps many of them, I shall 
not deny. I should esteem myself, as the world also 
would, vain and empty, were I to arrogate perfection. 
</p><p>
Knowledge in military matters is to be acquired by 
practice and experience only ; and, if I have erred, great 
allowance should be made for the want of them ; unless 
my errors should appear to be wilful ; and then, I conceive, it would be more generous to charge me with my 
faults, and let me stand or fall according to evidence, 
than to stigmatize me behind my back. 
</p><p>
It is uncertain in what light my services may have 
appeared to your Honor ; but this I know, and it is the 
highest consolation I am capable of feeling, that no man, 
that ever was employed in a public capacity, has endeavoured to discharge the trust reposed in him with 
greater honesty, and more zeal for the country's interest, than I have done ; and if there is any person living, 
who can say with justice, that I have offered any intentional wrong to the public, I will cheerfully submit to the 
most ignominious punishment, that an injured people 
ought to inflict. On the other hand, it is hard to have 
my character arraigned, and my actions condemned, 
without a hearing. 
</p><p>
I must therefore again beg in more plain, and in very 
earnest terms, to know, if Colonel C. has taken the liberty of representing my character to your Honor with 
such ungentlemanly freedom as the letter implies ? 
Your condescension herein will be acknowledged, as a 
singular favor done your Honor's most obedient, humble 
servant.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 22d ultimo came to hand about four 
days ago. In answer to that part, which relates to 
Colonel C.'s gross and infamous reflections on my conduct last spring, it will be needless, I dare say, to observe further at this time, than that the liberty, which he 
has been pleased to allow himself in sporting with my 
character, is little else than a comic entertainment, discovering at one view his passionate fondness for your 
friend, his inviolable love of truth, his unfathomable 
knowledge, and the masterly strokes of his wisdom in 
displaying it. These several talents he has, I think, 
exhibited in a most conspicuous manner to every person, who was in the least degree acquainted with the 
situation of affairs in this county at that juncture. The 
report of your false musters is equally absurd.

You are heartily welcome to make use of any letter,

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a copy of a letter, which I received from Captain M c Kenzie. Since my last, the different parties 
I detached in quest of the enemy, who committed the 
late depredations in this neighbourhood, are returned, 
after having prosecuted the most feasible measures, and 
exerted their utmost efforts in vain, in endeavouring 
to come up with the enemy and prevent their escape. 
Nor is this in any degree surprising. When the vast 
extent of country, the scattered condition of the inhabitants, the nature of the ground, and the disposition of the 
enemy, are collectively considered, it is next to impossible, that any of our parties should ever see the enemy, 
except when they possess such advantages as render their victory certain. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of this valuable and very fertile valley 
are terrified beyond expression. Some have abandoned 
their plantations, and many are packing up their most 
valuable effects to follow them. Another irruption into 
the heart of this settlement will, I am afraid, be of fatal 
consequence. I was always persuaded, and almost 
every day affords new matter for confirming me in the 
opinion, that the enemy can, with the utmost facility, 
render abortive every plan, which can be concerted 
upon our present system of defence ; and that the only 
method of effectually defending such a vast extent of 
mountains covered with thick woods, like our frontiers, 
against such an enemy, is by carrying the war into their 
country. And I think I may, without assuming uncommon penetration, venture to affirm, that, unless an 
expedition is carried on against the Ohio next spring, 
this country will not be another year in our possession. 
</p><p>
Sickness, and the different parties, which the distressed situation of affairs here obliged me to detach 
from this garrison, so greatly retard the works, that the 
finishing of even the principal parts of them, before the 
winter sets in, will, I am afraid, prove impracticable.

I understand there is a mortar and a number of shells at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, which would be of great service here. 
We have a quantity of round and grape-shot for sixpounders, but no cannon for using them. A few pieces 
of that size would be an essential addition to our 
strength; and, as this is the only place we have, at 
which, were it finished, a stand could be made, in case 
of any formidable attack, I conceive nothing in our 
power should be omitted to make it as defensible as we can.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Both your Honor's letters of the 24th ultimo I received by Jenkins. As I cannot now send a proper 
monthly return of the regiment, for want of the remarks 
of the officers at the out-posts, I enclose an exact return of our effective strength, and how it is disposed of, 
which will at present answer the end proposed. I likewise send you the return of provisions, specifying the 
time they will serve. 
</p><p>
The assistant commissaries must still be continued, 
or some persons in their room, who, under the direction 
of a principal, would have purchased the provisions upon 
as good terms as any contractor. Besides, the commissary used to act as wagon-master, supply the different garrisons with candles, made from the tallow of 
the country's beeves, and do many things for the good 
of the service, not to be expected from a contractor. 
</p><p>
I shall take the earliest opportunity of communicating your intentions, respecting the ranging company, to 
Captain Hogg, who, I am informed, is lying ill, in consequence of the bite of a snake at Dickinson's Fort, and 
will, I fear, be unable to raise the men. I apprehend 
the recruiting of one hundred men will be found a very 
difficult task. I am quite at a loss how to act, as you 
did not inform me upon what terms they are to be levied 
and supported, what bounty-money to allow, what pay 
to promise the officers and men, how they are to be 
clothed and supported, and what kind of commissions 
the officers are to have. If they should have the same 
bounty, that is allowed by the Assembly for recruits, I 
shall want money for that purpose. Enclosed is a copy 
of the last letter I received from Colonel Stanwix. The 
enemy continue their horrid devastations in this settlement. The day before Captain Lewis was attacked, 
twenty Cherokees, headed by one of the principal warriors of that nation, marched hence to the South Branch, 
who, with the troops under Captains Waggener and 
M c Kenzie, will, I hope, secure that quarter. 
</p><p>
When Mr. Atkin went away, he took with him 
Mr. Gist and the Indian interpreter. Since that time 
several parties of Cherokees have been here, by which I 
and my officers were involved in inconceivable trouble, 
as we had neither an interpreter, nor any right to hold 
conferences with them ; no articles to satisfy their demands, nor liberty to procure them. These warlike, 
formidable people, although they seem to have a natural 
and strong attachment to our interest, will, I am afraid, 
be induced by such treatment to hearken to the pressing solicitations of the French, who, by the latest and 
best accounts, are making them vastly advantageous offers. The Chief of the Cherokee party, who went last 
to the Branch, and who is said to be a man of great 
weight in that nation, was so incensed on account of what he imagined neglect and contempt, that, had we 
not supplied him with a few necessaries, without which 
he could not go to war, he threatened to return, fired 
with resentment, to his nation. In short, I dread that, 
by the present management of Indian affairs, we are 
losing the interest of those people, the preservation of 
whose friendship is of the last importance to the colonies 
in general, and to this in particular. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to acquaint you, that the quartermaster has 
misbehaved egregiously, embezzling and disposing of 
some of the regimental stores, and afterwards running 
away, and taking a man of the regiment with him. He 
had leave to go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, to order up some of the 
stores left there, and managed his affairs with such cunning, that he was gone too long to be pursued, before 
he was suspected. 
</p><p>
I do not know, that I ever gave your Honor cause to 
suspect me of ingratitude, a crime I detest, and would 
most carefully avoid. If an open, disinterested behaviour 
causes offence, I may have offended; because I have all 
along laid it down as a maxim, to represent facts freely 
and impartially, but not more so to others, Sir, than to 
you. If instances of my ungrateful behaviour had been 
particularized, I would have answered them. But I 
have long been convinced, that my actions and their 
motives have been maliciously misrepresented. 
</p><p>
As your Honor proposes to leave the colony in November, I should be glad of liberty to go down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> towards the last of this month, or first of the 
next, if nothing should intervene, to settle some accounts with you and the Committee, which may not be 
done in so satisfactory a manner after you are gone.
</p><p>
The last alarm occasioned a great many of the inhabitants of this county to go off, and vast numbers are 
still moving. I fear that, in a short time, this very valuable valley will be in a great measure depopulated. 
What further steps to take, and how to obviate so serious a misfortune, I am quite at a loss. As I have 
hitherto neglected nothing within the compass of my 
power, it is very evident, that nothing but vigorous offensive measures, next campaign, can save the country, 
at least all west of the Blue Ridge, from inevitable desolation. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, the express, whom I sent to Major Lewis, is come in, and brings returns of those 
companies ; so that you will now receive proper monthly returns for July and August. By these you will see, 
that our total strength amounts to thirty -two commissioned officers, forty -eight non-commissioned, and seven 
hundred and three rank and file ; whereof twenty officers, thirty non-commissioned, and four hundred and 
sixty-four rank and file, are employed in this county and Hampshire. But six women are always allowed to a 
company, who draw provisions; and the officers receive more or less according to their respective rank, as 
you will see by the estimate received from Colonel Stanwix, and forwarded to you some time ago ; which 
must be considered in the calculation. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with an opportunity by Mr. Livingston, 
to acknowledge the receipt of your agreeable favor of 
the 19th ultimo; and to inform you of a very extraordinary affair, which has happened at this place, namely, 
the desertion of our quartermaster. This infamous fellow, as he has proved himself, after having disposed, in 
a clandestine manner, of many of our regimental stores, 
being called upon to settle his accounts (not that I, or 
any officer in the regiment, had the least suspicion of 
the roguery he was carrying on), pretended, that he 
could not come to an exact settlement without going to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, where some of the stores yet lay. Several 
of our soldiers deserting at the same time, he was sent 
in pursuit of them, which afforded him the desired opportunity of making his escape. His villany was not 
laid open, before his departure, and was at last accidentally discovered. This person had been several years a 
sergeant in one of his Majesty's regiments, and in this 
character he served three years under me. During 
that time he gave such signal proofs of his bravery and 
good behaviour, as bound me, in honor and gratitude, to 
do something for him. And I therefore got him promoted to be quartermaster, as he was acquainted with 
the duty, and capable, I thought, of discharging it. 
</p><p>
We have had several visitations from the enemy, and 
much mischief done, since my last to you. About the 
1 7th ultimo upwards of twenty persons were killed only 
twelve miles from this garrison, and, notwithstanding I 
sent a strong detachment hence to pursue them, and 
ordered the passes of the mountains to be waylaid by 
forces from other places, yet we were not able to meet 
with these savages. 
</p><p>
On Friday sevennight, a body of near or quite a hun 
dred fell upon the inhabitants along the great road between this place and Pennsylvania, and killed or took 
fifteen more. The mischief would have been much 
greater, had not an officer and twenty men of the regiment, who were then out, fallen in with and engaged the enemy. Finding, however, that his party was overpowered, and likely to be surrounded, he retreated to a 
stockade, not far distant, in which they were besieged 
for three hours ; but the firing communicated an alarm 
from one habitation to another, by which means most of 
the families were timely apprised of their danger, and 
happily escaped. Our party killed one Indian, whose 
scalp they obtained, and wounded several others. 
</p><p>
I exert every means in my power to protect a much 
distressed country, but it is a task too arduous. To 
think of defending a frontier of more than three hundred 
and fifty miles' extent, with only seven hundred men, is 
vain and idle, especially when that frontier lies more 
contiguous to the enemy than any other. I am, and 
have for a long time been, fully convinced, that, if we 
continue to pursue a defensive plan, the country must 
be inevitably lost. 
</p><p>
You will be kind enough, Sir, to excuse the freedom 
with which I deliver my sentiments, and believe me to 
be, as I really am, with unfeigned truth and regard, 
Your most obedient, humble servant.

TO JOHN ROBINSON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 25 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1757">1757</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I applied to the Governor for permission to go down 
and settle my accounts before he leaves the country, and 
to represent the melancholy situation of our distressed 
frontiers, which no written narrative can so well describe, as a verbal account to a judicious person inclined 
to hear. In conversation, the questions resulting from 
one relation beget others, till matters are perfectly understood; whereas the most explicit writing will be 
found deficient. But his Honor was pleased to deny 
his leave, thinking my request unreasonable, and that I 
had some party of pleasure in view. 
</p><p>
I have, in a letter to the Governor by this conveyance, endeavoured to set in as clear a light as I am able, the 
situation of our frontiers, and the disposition of the inhabitants ; and I shall aim also, in as succinct a manner 
as possible, to make you acquainted with the same. 
</p><p>
The inhabitants of this fertile, and once populous valley, are now become our most western settlers, save the 
few families that areforted on the Branch. The enemy 
have, in a great measure, ceased committing hostilities 
on the Branch, and fallen upon the people of this valley, 
and a considerable part of them have already removed. 
This, by persons unacquainted with the country, and 
the enemy we have to deal with, may be attributed to 
the cowardice of the inhabitants, or inactivity of the soldiers, but by others it will be imputed to neither. No 
troops in the universe can guard against the cunning 
and wiles of Indians. No one can tell where they will 
fall, till the mischief is done, and then it is in vain to 
pursue. The inhabitants see, and are convinced of this, 
which makes each family afraid of standing in the gap 
of danger ; and by retreating, one behind another, they 
depopulate the country, and leave it to the enemy, who 
subsist upon the plunder. 
</p><p>
If we pursue a defensive plan next campaign, there 
will not, by the autumn, be one soul living on this side 
of the Blue Ridge, except the soldiers in garrison, and 
such of the inhabitants as may seek shelter therein. 
This, Sir, I know to be the immovable determination of 
the people ; and, believe me, I have been at great pains, 
before I could prevail on them to wait the consultations 
of this winter, and the events of the spring. 
</p><p>
I do not know on whom these miserable, undone 
people are to rely for protection. If the Assembly are 
to give it to them, it is time that measures were at least 
concerting, and not when they ought to be going into execution, as has always been the case. If they are to seek 
it from the Commander-in-chief, it is time their condition was made known to him ; for I cannot forbear repeating again, that while we pursue defensive measures 
we pursue inevitable ruin, the loss of the country being 
the inevitable and fatal consequence. There will be 
no end to our troubles, while we follow this plan, and 
every year will increase our expense. This, my dear 
Sir, I urge not only as an officer, but as a friend, 
who has property in the country and is unwilling to 
lose it. This it is, also, that makes me anxious for 
doing more than barely to represent these matters, 
which is all that is expected of an officer commanding. 
</p><p>
It is not possible for me to convey a just sense of the posture of our affairs. It would be vain to attempt it 
I, therefore, content myself with entreating you to use 
'our influence to prevent such delays, as we have 
dtherto met with, if you think this affair depends on 
the Assembly. If you think the Assembly have done 
all in their power, and that recourse must be had elsewhere, I am determined, as I will spare neither cost nor 
pains, to apply to Colonel Stanwix (who commands in 
this quarter, with whom I am acquainted, and from 
whom I have received several kind and affectionate letters,) for leave to wait on him with an account of our 
circumstances. Through these means, perhaps, we 
may be able to draw a little of Lord Loudoun's attention 
to the preservation of these colonies. 
</p><p>
Pray let me have your sentiments. I have not time to put my thoughts in a proper dress. The bearer is 
waiting, and I am in other respects hurried. But the truth of what I have asserted, believe me, is unquestionable ; as well as that I am, with the most affectionate 
regards, your most obedient servant and friend.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Duty to my country, and his Majesty's interest, indispensably require, that I again trouble your Honor on the 
subject of Indian affairs here, which have been impeded 
and embarrassed by such a train of mismanagement, as, 
if continued, must produce melancholy consequences. 
</p><p>
The sincere disposition of the Cherokees heartily to 
espouse our cause has been demonstrated beyond every 
doubt ; and, if they were rewarded in a proper manner, 
it would, in all probability, be the means of effecting a 
favorable change in the present unhappy situation of 
this part of his Majesty's dominions. 
</p><p>
But, instead of meeting with the encouragement, 
which their services and bravery have merited, several 
of them, after having undergone the toils and fatigues of 
long marches, destitute of the conveniences and almost 
of the necessaries of life, have, in that situation, gone to 
war, and behaved nobly, from which we have reaped a 
signal advantage. When returned here, with their trophies of honor, they must have gone home without any 
kind of reward or thanks, or even provisions to support 
them on their march, justly fired with resentment, had 
not I and my officers procured them some things, of 
which they were in absolute want, and made it the object of our care, in various respects, to please them. 
</p><p>
Another party of those Indians since arrived opportunely to our assistance, at the very juncture the enemy 
made an irruption into this settlement, pursued their 
tracks, came up with three of them, scalped two, and 
wounded the third. They are now returned from the 
pursuit, and are nearly in the same situation with those 
abovementioned. I applied to Captain Gist in their behalf, and told him I must represent the matter to your 
Honor. But he assures me, that he has neither goods, 
money to procure them, nor even an interpreter, being 
thereby incapable of doing any kind of service. It is 
surprising, that any man should be entrusted with transacting such important affairs, and not be possessed of 
the means. Thus he, and several others, who receive 
high pay from Virginia, are not only rendered useless, 
but our interest with those Indians is at the brink of destruction. Whenever any of them arrive here, they immediately apply to me ; but I have neither any thing to 
give them, nor any right to do it. Nor is there a person, who can inform them to what these and their other 
disappointments are owing; which reduces me to a 
dilemma, from which I would most gladly be extricated. 
</p><p>
I must likewise beg leave to mention once more the 
vast hardships, which many of the people groan under 
here, from having been so long kept out of the money, 
that the country owes them on account of the Indians. 
</p><p>
When I proposed going down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, several of them brought their accounts to me, which I 
intended, had you given me liberty, to lay before your 
Honor. I mention this circumstance, not with any view 
of being employed in examining and paying off those 
accounts, which for many reasons I can by no means 
undertake, but in hope that your Honor will be pleased 
to give directions, and appoint some person to that duty, 
by the neglect of which so many poor people greatly 
suffer. I am, &c.

Hearing of the Governor's departure for England, I

that I am yet but imperfectly recovered, which is the

I have many accounts to settle with the Committee,

</p><p>
MY DEAR COLONEL, 
</p><p>
Your two favors, with the extract of a letter from Lord Loudoun, were this day delivered to me. In the 
latter you condescend to ask my opinion of Major Smith. Pray, does not his plan sufficiently indicate the 
man ? Can there be a better index to his abilities, than his scheme for reducing the enemy on the Ohio, and his 
expeditious march of a thousand men to Detroit? Surely, he intended to provide them with wings to facilitate their 
passage over so mountainous and extensive a country, or in what way else could he accomplish it? 
</p><p>
I am unacquainted with the navigation of the rivers he proposes to traverse, and, consequently, cannot be a 
competent judge of his scheme in this respect ; but the distance is so great, and that through an enemy's country, that, I candidly confess, it appears to me a romantic 
plan, not to be executed. For, if we are strong enough to attempt the reduction of the Ohio, what necessity is 
there for our making such a circuitous march, and leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> behind us, which is the source of all 
our ills? If we are too weak to attempt that place, what have we not to dread from leaving it in our rear ? 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are my sentiments upon Major Smith's 
project. With regard to the person, if I have been 
rightly informed, he actually had a commission to command a ranging company, and obtained it by making 
promises, which he never could comply with. He was 
adjudged, by persons better acquainted with him than I 
am, to be quite unfit to command even a company. He 
lost the Block-House, in which he commanded, by suffering his men to straggle from it at pleasure, which the 
Indians observing, took advantage of his weakness, and attacked him at a time when he had no men in his 
works. It is, nevertheless, agreed on all hands, that he made a gallant defence, but I never before heard of any 
capitulation that was granted to him. 
</p><p>
I have not had the pleasure of seeing Major Smith, 
though I have been favored with a letter from him, in 
which he politely professes some concern at hearing 
of my indisposition, as it prevented him from seeing me 
at Winchester ; but he desires, at the same time, that I 
will attend him at his house in Augusta, about two hundred miles off, or in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> by the 20th instant, 
when, I suppose, he intends to honor me with Ms orders.
</p><p>
I have never been able to return to my command, 
since I wrote to you last, my disorder at times returning 
obstinately upon me, in spite of the efforts of all the sons 
of jEsculapius, whom I have hitherto consulted. At 
certain periods I have been reduced to great extremity, 
and have now too much reason to apprehend an approaching decay, being visited with several symptoms of such a disease. 
</p><p>
I am at this time under' a strict regimen, and shall set 
out to-morrow for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> to receive the advice of 
the best physicians there. My constitution is much impaired, and nothing can retrieve it, but the greatest care 
and the most circumspect course of life. This being 
the case, as I have now no prospect left of preferment 
in the military way, and despair of rendering that immediate service, which my country may require from the 
person commanding its troops, I have thoughts of quitting my command, and retiring from all public business, 
leaving my post to be filled by some other person more capable of the task, and who may, perhaps, have his endeavours crowned with better success than mine have 
been. But, wherever I go, or whatever becomes of me, I shall always retain the sincerest and most affectionate 
regards for you; being, dear Sir, your most obedient and obliged humble servant

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Permit me, at the same time that I congratulate you, 
which I most sincerely do, on your promotion, so justly 
merited, to express my concern at the prospect of 
parting with you. I can truly say, that it is a matter of 
no small regret to me, and that I should have thought 
myself happy in serving this campaign under your immediate command. But every thing, I hope, is ordered 
for the best, and it is our duty to submit. I must, nevertheless, beg, that you will add one more kindness to 
the many I have experienced, and that is, to mention 
me in favorable terms to General Forbes, if you are acquainted with that gentleman, not as a person, who would depend upon him for further recommendation to 
military preferment (for I have long conquered all such 
inclinations, and shall serve this campaign merely for 
the purpose of affording my best endeavours to bring 
matters to a conclusion), but as a person, who would 
gladly be distinguished in some measure from the common run of provincial officers, as I understand there will 
be a motley herd of us.
</p><p>
Nothing can contribute more to his Majesty's interest 
in this quarter, than an early campaign, or a speedy 
junction of the troops to be employed in this service. 
Without this, I fear the Indians will with difficulty be 
restrained from returning to their nation before we assemble, and, in that event, no words can tell how much 
they will be missed. It is an affair of great importance, 
and ought to claim the closest attention of the commanding officer. On the assistance of these people the 
security of our march very much depends. 
</p><p>
Great care should be taken, also, to lay in a supply 
of proper goods for them. The Indians are mercenary ; 
every service of theirs must be purchased; and they 
are easily offended, being thoroughly sensible of their 
own importance. Upwards of five hundred are already 
come to this place, the greater part of whom are gone 
to war. Many others are daily expected, and we have 
neither arms nor clothes suitable to give them. Nor, 
indeed, is it reasonable to expect, that the whole expense accruing on account of these people should fall 
upon this government, which has already in this particular, as well as in many others, exerted its utmost abilities for his Majesty's interest, and, in the present case, 
shares only an equal proportion of the advantages arising from Indian services. 
</p><p>
These crude thoughts are hastily thrown together. If 
you find any thing in them, which may be useful, be 
pleased to turn them to his Majesty's interest. The 
indulgence, which you have hitherto allowed me, joined 
to my zeal for the service, has encouraged me to use 
this freedom with you, Sir, which I should not choose 
to take unasked with another. 
</p><p>
If it .is not improper, I should be glad to be informed 
what regular troops are to be employed under BrigadierGeneral Forbes, and when they may be expected? 
Also, where they are to rendezvous. 
</p><p>
Fort Frederic, I hear, is mentioned for this purpose, 
and, in my humble opinion, a little unadvisedly. In the 
first place, because the country people all around are 
fled, and the troops will, consequently, lack those refreshments so needful to soldiers. In the next place, I 
am fully convinced there never can be a road made between Fort Frederic and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, that will 
admit the transportation of carriages. I have passed it 
in company with many others, who were of the same 
opinion. Lastly, because this is the place [<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>] to which all Indian parties, either going to, or returning from war, will inevitably repair.

MY DEAR HALKET,

Are we to have you once more among us? And shall we revisit together a hapless spot, that proved so 
fatal to many of our former brave companions ? Yes ; and I rejoice at it, hoping it will now be in our power to 
testify a just abhorrence of the cruel butcheries exercised on our friends, in the unfortunate day of General 
Braddock's defeat ; and, moreover, to show our enemies, that we can practise all that lenity of which they only boast, without affording any adequate proofs.

To cut short, I really feel a satisfaction at the prospect of meeting you again, although I have scarcely time to tell you so, as the express is waiting.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I think it incumbent on me to be informed by your 
Honor, how the regiment under my command is to be 
furnished with tents, ammunition, cartridge-paper, and 
many other requisites, that may be wanted in the course 
of the campaign. We expect here to be furnished with 
all those articles from his Majesty's stores, but it is necessary for me to learn this from you. 
</p><p>
The last Assembly, in their Supply Bill, provided for 
a chaplain to our regiment. On this subject I had often 
without any success applied to Governor Dinwiddie. I 
now flatter myself, that your Honor will be pleased to 
appoint a sober, serious man for this duty. Common 
decency, Sir, in a camp calls for the services of a divine, 
which ought not to be dispensed with, although the 
world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of 
religion, and incapable of good instructions.

I now enclose a monthly return for March, and am, 
honorable Sir, your most obedient, humble servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Permit .me to return you my sincere thanks for the honor you were pleased to do me, in a letter to Mr. President Blair, and to assure you, that to merit a continuance of the good opinion you have expressed of me, shall be among my principal endeavours. I have no higher ambition, than to act my part well during the campaign ; and if I should thereby merit your approbation, it will be a most pleasing reward for the toils I shall undergo. 
</p><p>
It gives me no small pleasure, that an officer of your 
experience, abilities, and good character should be appointed to command the expedition, and it is with equal 
satisfaction I congratulate you upon the promising prospect of a glorious campaign. 
</p><p>
The Indians seem to anticipate our success, by joining us, thus early, with seven hundred of their warriors. Captain Bosomworth, who held a conference with their 
chiefs, can fully inform you of their good inclinations to assist his Majesty's troops, and to him I refer you. Two things, however, I must beg leave to indicate, as likely 
to contribute greatly to their ease and contentment; namely, an early campaign, and plenty of goods. These are matters, which they often remind us of, both in their public councils and private conferences. 
</p><p>
I have received no orders yet to assemble the dispersed companies of the Virginia regiment, some of whom are two hundred miles distant from this place ; 
so that, I fear, we shall make a sorry appearance at the general rendezvous. We are very much in want of tents, and have none with which to encamp the regiment when it assembles. This fort cannot yet furnish 
barracks, nor can the town supply quarters sufficient.

I am, Sir, with very great respect, your most obedient 
and most obliged humble servant.

SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>, 24 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 19th instant, intended to come by Colonel Stephen, was received to-day about noon by 
express. As it contains several matters of an interesting nature, I chose to be aided in my determinations by 
the advice of my officers, and I now enclose their and my opinions on the several heads. 
</p><p>
I could by no means think of executing, willingly, that discretionary power, with which you were pleased to 
invest me, of ordering out the militia, f It is an affair, Sir, of too important and delicate a nature for me to 
manage. Much discontent will be the inevitable consequence of this draft. 
</p><p>
That was a most extraordinary request of Colonel Mercer's, concerning the exchange of officers, and calculated, it should seem, rather to breed confusion, 
than to benefit the other regiment. There is not an 
ensign there, that would not rather quit the service, than 
accept of a company in the other regiment, so much do 
they disapprove Colonel Mercer's proposal ; and I have 
neither inclination nor power to force their compliance. 
Captain Rutherford's company was raised and posted in 
this quarter by Governor Dinwiddie's express orders, 
and can be more useful here, than any other men whatever, being all sons of the neighbouring farmers, men of 
property, young, active, and acquainted with the woods 
on these frontiers. Whereas, if they go to the southward, they will be utter strangers to the enemy's haunts, 
and of no more use there, than the militia of an adjacent 
county; while their places here must be supplied by 
militia equally ignorant of these woods ; besides giving 
them a useless march of two hundred miles, and exposing the frontiers in the mean time. Another reason, 
which may be urged, is, that their property all lies in 
this county. Interested motives induced them to enlist, 
and to be vigilant in defending it, and, I believe, they 
would desert, rather than go to the southward. 
</p><p>
Your Honor will please to remember, that one of the 
last questions, which I had an opportunity of asking, 
was, whether I should send out recruiting parties. You 
replied, " that, since the Assembly was so near meeting, 
you would defer giving any directions on that head." 
As I had no money for the purpose, I hope it will not 
seem surprising, that we have recruited but few men 
since. I have been waiting for orders to complete the 
regiment. I shall now use my best endeavours, with 
the very few officers, who can be spared from the garrisons, dispersed as we are. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am this day favored with yours of the 4th instant, 
and should have thought myself extremely culpable and deficient in my duty, had I delayed one moment in 
transmitting to the General any intelligence I could procure ; much more in a matter so material as that upon 
which he has been informed. I must, therefore, beg 
that you will, from me, assure the General, that the 
Catawbas have not this year brought in one prisoner or 
scalp to this place, nor indeed to any other that I have 
heard of. No prisoner has been taken by any of our 
friendly Indians this season, and no scalps, except the 
two taken near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> by Ucahula, of which, 
and all the intelligence of the enemy in that quarter, 
which that young warrior was able to give, I, by the last 
post, sent to the General a full and circumstantial account. Nor would I have failed to keep him duly informed of every interesting occurrence, even had it not 
been recommended to me. 
</p><p>
It gave me no small uneasiness to be informed of the 
resolution of some of the Cherokees, to wander towards 
the Indian settlements in Maryland and Pennsylvania, 
clearly foreseeing the bad consequences such a peregrination would produce. I therefore represented the matter to Captain Gist in the strongest manner, and must 
do him the justice to say, that nothing in his power was 
omitted to prevent it. But our efforts proved ineffectual, as those two provinces last year, very impoliticly I 
humbly conceive, made presents to these Indians, and encouraged their returning thither this spring. Such is 
the nature of Indians, that nothing will prevent their going where they have any reason to expect presents, and 
their cravings are insatiable. 
</p><p>
I and my officers have constantly paid, and always will pay, the strictest regard to every circumstance, that 
may contribute to keep the Indians in good humor. But, as Governor Dinwiddie ordered me not to meddle 
with Indian affairs on any pretence whatever, the sole management of them being left to Mr. Atkin and his 
deputy Mr. Gist, and those orders having never been countermanded, neither I, nor my officers, have adventured to do any thing relative to them, but in a secondary manner through Mr. Gist. 
</p><p>
The Raven warrior was on a scout, in which he was unsuccessful. On his return hither, he produced two 
white men's scalps, which he brought from his own nation, and wanted to pass them for the enemy's, taken in 
his unsuccessful scout. In this villany he was detected by the other warriors, who were highly offended at so 
base a deceit, and threatened to kill him. A consciousness of his guilt, and a dread of being called to a severe 
account by his own countrymen, were the reasons, which many of them assigned for his going away in so 
abrupt, but by no means unsatisfactory, manner to the English. As Captain Bosomworth was here transacting 
Indian affairs, under the immediate orders of the Commander-in-chief, when the Raven warrior returned and 
was detected, I only wrote in mine to General Forbes incidentally on the subject, referring him to Captain Bosomworth for particulars. 
</p><p>
Enclosed is my return for April, but you will please to observe, that Captain Woodward's is made out from 
his last, as his great distance from hence puts it out of his power to send it in due time. 
</p><p>
I beg you will inform the General, that I shall, with 
great alacrity, obey all the orders, with which he may 
honor me. In the mean time, I am, with unfeigned regard, dear Halket, yours, &,c.

<p>
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>,28 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I came here at this critical juncture, by the express 
order of Sir John St. Clair, to represent in the fullest 
manner the posture of our affairs at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, and to 
obviate any doubts, that might arise from the best written narrative. I shall make use of the following method, 
as the most effectual I can at present suggest, to lay 
sundry matters before you, for your information, approbation, and direction. And I hope, that, when your 
Honor considers how we are situated, and the importance of despatch, you will please to give me explicit 
and speedy answers, on the several points here submitted. 
</p><p>
First, Sir John St. Glair's letter jvill, I apprehend, 
inform you of our principal wants, namely, arms, tents, 
and other sorts of field- equipage, articles so absolutely 
and obviously necessary, as to need no argument to 
prove, that the men will be useless without them, and 
that the vast sums of money, expended in levying and 
marching them to the place of rendezvous, will be entirely lost, besides impeding if not defeating the expedition. 
</p><p>
Secondly, the officers will be unprovided with the 
means of taking the field, till they have an allowance 
made them of baggage, forage, and bat-money. Governor Dinwiddie, from what cause I could never yet learn, thought proper to discontinue this allowance to the 
companies that remained in Virginia, at the same time 
that he allowed it to those who went to Carolina, although I produced evidence under General Stanwix's 
hand, that all officers were entitled to it, and that it was 
essential to enable them to take the field. General 
Forbes has obtained this allowance for the Pennsylvania 
troops, and desired Sir John St. Clair to urge it strongly 
on this government also. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, the unequal pay of the two Virginia regiments will, I conceive, if a stop is not put to it, be productive of great discontent, and many evils. For the 
soldiers of the first regiment think their claim upon the 
country equally as good, if not better than that of the 
second, because their services are not limited.  They 
have lacked the great bounty, which the others have received, and have had no clothes for almost two years, 
although they have an annual call for clothes, and in 
strictness the same right to expect them. 
</p><p>
Fourthly, as our regimental clothing cannot possibly 
last through the campaign, will it not be advisable to 
obtain a supply for next winter? I have sent to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> for one thousand pair of Indian stockings, or 
leggins, the better to equip my men for the woods ; and 
I now inquire whether I am to pay for them in behalf of 
the country, or deduct the cost out of their pay. As 
they have not received the clothing, to which they are 
entitled, they may think this latter a hardship. 
</p><p>
Fifthly, should not the pay of the surgeon's mates in 
the first regiment be equal to that of those in the 
second 1 The latter have four shillings and the former only three per day. Should there not, likewise, be the 
same number of surgeon's mates allowed to the old as 
to the new regiment ? 
</p><p>
Sixthly, it will cause great dissatisfaction in the regiment, if Lieutenant Baker is put over the heads of older 
officers. It is granted, that Mr. Baker is a very deserving officer, but there are others equally deserving, and 
who have adventured equally to seek glory, and to merit 
applause. 
</p><p>
Seventhly, Sir John St. Clair directs, in consequence 
of orders from the General, that the first Virginia regiment shall immediately be completed, and leaves the 
mode of doing it to your Honor. I should be glad of 
direction in this affair. The season, I fear, is too far 
advanced to attempt it now by recruiting. 
</p><p>
Eighthly, are the works at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a> still to go 
on ? If so, in what manner are they to be forwarded, 
and under whose direction ? Nothing surely will contribute more to the public weal, than this fort when 
completed ; because it will be a valuable repository for 
our stores, if the event of our enterprise prove successful, and an asylum for the inhabitants, and a place 
of retreat for our troops, in case of a defeat. 
</p><p>
Ninthly, great advantages must arise, by appointing 
Lieutenant Smith to that direction, and to the command 
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. First, because he has had the charge 
of the works for nearly two years, and has, by that 
means, become perfectly well acquainted with every 
thing intended to be done. Secondly, because there 
must necessarily be many sick and lame soldiers left at 
that garrison, who may require the eye of a diligent officer to keep them together. Thirdly, because all the 
regimental stores and baggage must remain at that place, 
and ought to be under the care of an officer, who can 
be made accountable for his conduct ; and not left to the mercy of an ungovernable and refractory militia. 
Fourthly, this is important, if for no other reason than 
to preserve the materials lying there for finishing the 
works. 
</p><p>
Tenthly, I conceive we shall be ordered to take with us the greatest part of the ammunition now at Fort 
Loudoun. It will be necessary, therefore, to have a supply laid in at that place for the use of the frontier garrisons. 
</p><p>
Eleventhly, in a late letter I endeavoured to point out, in what manner the service would be benefited, by continuing Rutherford's rangers in the parts they at 
present occupy, and sending the militia of Prince William to the Branch. I again recommend it, for the reasons then given, and for many others, which might be given. 
</p><p>
I must now conclude, with once more begging, that your Honor will hasten some speedy determination on these several matters. From what Sir John St. Clair 
has written, from my orders, and from the statement here made, I conceive it must sufficiently appear, that the greatest despatch is necessary. The success of our 
expedition will, in a manner, depend on its early commencement. Every delay, therefore, may be attended with pernicious consequences. 
</p><p>
The Indians, glad of any pretence for returning home, will make use of delays for a handle ; and a spirit of discontent and desertion may spring up among the new levies for want of employment. 
</p><p>
These are matters obvious to me, and my duty requires, that I represent them in this free and candid manner. I am your Honor's most obedient and most humble servant.

I flattered myself with the hope of seeing your Honor at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> when I was down, but the business,

Mr. President Blair has no doubt informed you of the nature of that business, and the state of the troops here, 
and, generally, of the situation of affairs in this quarter. I will not, therefore, trouble you with a repetition of these 
particulars, but enclose to you a copy of the last orders, which I have received, and which I am preparing to execute with the greatest exactness.

the great want of clothing for the first regiment, and 
how necessary it was to send to England for a supply. 
They declined doing any thing in the matter at that 
time, because the funds granted by the late Assembly 
were almost exhausted. But I hope it will not escape 
your Honor's notice, if another Assembly should soon

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
According to orders I marched from Winchester on 
the 24th ultimo, and arrived at this place yesterday, 
with five companies of the first Virginia regiment, and a 
company of artificers from the second, as you may observe by the enclosed returns. My march, in consequence of bad teams and bad roads, notwithstanding I 
had sent forward the artificers and a covering party 
three days before, was much delayed. As I cannot suppose you intended to send any part of my men upon 
the roads, till joined at this place by Colonel Byrd, I shall decline sending any on that service till he arrives, which I presume will be to-morrow. 
</p><p>
There came twenty-eight wagons with me to this place, and I believe, if they were wanted, ten more 
might be had upon the South Branch, strong and good ; but carrying-horses are certainly more eligible for the 
service to which we are destined. I have received a very scanty allowance of tents for the five companies, 
namely, sixty-nine only. Out of these most of the officers must either be supplied, or lie uncovered. They 
will readily pay for what they receive, if required. No bell-tents were sent to us. 
</p><p>
My men are very bare of regimental clothing, and I 
have no prospect of a supply. So far from regretting 
this want during the present campaign, if I were left to 
pursue my own inclinations, I would not only order the 
men to adopt the Indian dress, but cause the officers to 
do it also, and be the first to set the example myself. 
Nothing but the uncertainty of obtaining the general approbation causes me to hesitate a moment to leave my 
regimentals at this place, and proceed as light as any 
Indian in the woods. It is an unbecoming dress, I own, 
for an officer; but convenience, rather than show, I think, 
should be consulted. The reduction of bat-horses alone 
would be sufficient to recommend it ; for nothing is more 
certain than that less baggage would be required, and 
the public benefited in proportion. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Colonel Byrd, with eight companies of his regiment, 
arrived here yesterday. He left many sick men behind, and, as he posted a company at Edwards's and 
Pearsall's, our strength is considerably reduced. 
</p><p>
Captain Dagworthy informed me, that Governor 
Sharpe is to open the road to Town Creek, within fifteen miles of this place, and, as Maryland has nearly 
two hundred men here fit for duty, I hope you will be 
of opinion, that they are sufficiently strong to proceed 
on the Fort Frederic road, without needing a reinforcement from us ; especially if you will consider, that they 
are in a manner covered by the troops here, and by 
those to be employed on the road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, to 
which service I shall send a detachment to-morrow. 
We have no hay at this place ; it was corn, which I 
called forage. We shall have tools enough to open the 
road to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, among the artificers of Colonel Byrd's 
regiment. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to hear that the Catawbas have so egregiously misbehaved. When I write to Governor Fauquier, I shall touch on this subject.
</p><p>
It gives me great pleasure to find, that you approve the dress I have put my men into. It is evident, that soldiers in that trim are better able to carry their provisions^ are fitter for the active service we must engage in, less liable to sink under the fatigues of a march, and 
we thus get rid of much baggage, which would lengthen our line of march. These, and not whim or caprice, were my reasons for ordering this dress. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I was favored with your letter of the 14th instant, at 
eleven o'clock last night. The express, who brought it, 
informs me, that he was twice fired upon by Indians, 
and was obliged to abandon his horse to save himself. 
</p><p>
Three parties have gone hence towards the enemy within these few days past. The largest of them, consisting of an officer and eighteen Cherokees, marched three days ago. I always send some white men with the Indians, and will, to-day or to-morrow, send an officer and a greater number of white men with another party of Cherokees, because you desire it ; although, I 
must confess, it is my opinion, that small parties of Indians will more effectually harass the enemy, by keeping them under continual alarms, than any parties of 
white men can do. For small parties of the latter are not equal to the task, not being so dexterous at skulking as Indians ; and large parties will be discovered by their 
spies early enough to have a superior force opposed to them. Hence, in either case, there would be a great 
probability of losing many of our best men, and wearing down the rest, before the more essential services of the 
campaign would be entered upon, and this, I am afraid, without answering the proposed end. 
</p><p>
You are pleased to ask my opinion of the propriety 
of making an irruption into the enemy's country with 
a strong party. Such an enterprise, Sir, at this juncture, when we may suppose the enemy have collected, 
or are collecting, their whole force at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, 
would require a formidable detachment, the supplying 
of which with provisions would be too difficult and cumbersome to be effected undiscovered, as the enemy's 
parties are continually watching our motions. It is 
more than likely, therefore, that the enterprise would 
terminate in a miscarriage, if not in the destruction of 
the party. I should think it more eligible to defer such 
an attempt, until the army approaches more nearly to 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
I shall direct the officer, that marches out, to take 
particular pains in reconnoitring General Braddock's 
road, though I have had repeated information, that it 
only wants such small repairs, as could with ease be 
made as fast as the army would march. It is impossible 
for me to send out any men to repair it, as I have no 
tools for that purpose. If we had tools, and should go 
upon this road, the second company of artificers w r ould 
no doubt be wanted here ; but, as it is, I imagine they 
will be better employed with you. 
</p><p>
The misbehaviour of the Indians at your camp gives 
me great concern. If they were hearty in our interest, 
their services would be infinitely valuable. The best 
white men are not equal to them in the woods. But I 
fear they are too sensible of their own importance to 
render us much service. 
</p><p>
As the par of exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania is, by the laws of the two provinces, fixed at 
twenty-five per cent in favor of the former, I apprehend 
we can have no right to settle it on any other footing ; 
especially as any material deviation might be productiv< 
of very bad consequences. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, the warriors of the party oi 
Cherokees insisted upon marching instantly, and that 
but one white man should go. They are gone, and I 
have given the white man the necessary orders relative 
to the road. 
</p><p>
I am, with great sincerity, Sir, your most obedient 
servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I had, before Colonel Stephen came to this place, abandoned all thoughts of attending personally the election at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, choosing rather to leave the 
management of that affair to my friends, than be absent from my regiment, when there is a probability of its 
being called to duty. I am much pleased now, that did so. Colonel Byrd has given me your letter of yesterday, in consequence of which I send you a return oi 
the forage. He writes to Mr. Gist, requesting him to send vermilion for the Indians. 
</p><p>
We participate in the joy felt for the success of Majesty's arms at Louisburg, but sincerely lament the loss of the brave, active, and noble Lord Howe. 
</p><p>
The bridge is finished at this place, and to-morrow 
Major Peachey, with three hundred men, will proceed 
to open General Braddock's road. I shall direct them 
to go to George's Creek, ten miles in advance. By that 
time I may possibly hear from you. If they go farther, 
it may be requisite to reinforce the party. But this 
matter, I suppose, will be ordered according to the route 
determined on by the General, for it will be needless to 
open a road, of which no use will be made afterwards. 
</p><p>
Colonel Stephen gives me some room to apprehend, 
that a body of light troops may soon move on. I pray 
your interest, most sincerely, with the General, to get 
my regiment and myself included in the number. If 
any argument is needed to obtain this favor, I hope 
without vanity I may be allowed to say, that, from long 
intimacy with these woods, and frequent scouting in 
them, my men are at least as well acquainted with all 
the passes and difficulties, as any troops that will be employed. 
</p><p>
The General directs, that the troops shall be provided 
with covers to their locks. Where to get them I know 
not. There is but one possible way, and that is, by 
taking the hides of the cattle, and they will fall short. 
The commissaries ask eighteen shillings apiece for hides. 
I should be glad of your advice on this subject. What is to be done with the wagons expected up in our next 
convoy ? I cannot exactly predict their number, but I suppose the provisions, forage, and stores, cannot employ less than fifty. 
</p><p>
I am, with very great regard, your most obedient and obliged humble servant.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I do not incline to propose any thing, that may seem 
officious, but would it not facilitate the operation of the 
campaign, if the Virginia troops were ordered to proceed 
as far as the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a>, and construct forts at the 
most advantageous situations as they advance, opening the 
road at the same time ? In such a case, I should be 
glad to be joined by that part of my regiment at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>. Major Peachey, who commands the working 
party on Braddock's road, writes to me, that he finds 
few repairs wanting. To-night I shall order him to 
proceed as far as Savage River, and then return, as his 
party is too weak to adventure further. 
</p><p>
We have received advice that our second convoy, of more than seventy wagons, will be at the South Branch to-day, where I expect they will be joined by other 
wagons with forage. They will all proceed to this place immediately. 
</p><p>
I shall most cheerfully work on any road, pursue any route, or enter upon any service, that the General or 
yourself may think me usefully employed in, or qualified for, and shall never have a will of my own, when a duty is required of me. But since you desire me to speak 
my sentiments freely, permit me to observe, that after having conversed with all the guides, and having been 
informed by others, who have a knowledge of the country, I am convinced that a road, to be compared with 
General Braddock's, or, indeed, that will be fit for transportation even by packhorses, cannot be made. I have 
no predilection for the route you have in contemplation 
for me, not because difficulties appear therein, but because I doubt whether satisfaction can be given in the 
execution of the plan. I know not what reports you 
may have received from your reconnoitring parties ; but 
I have been uniformly told, that, if you expect a tolerable road by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, you will be disappointed, for no 
movement can be made that way without destroying our 
horses. 
</p><p>
I should be extremely glad of one hour's conference 
with you, when the General arrives. I could then explain myself more fully, and, I think, demonstrate the 
advantages of pushing out a body of light troops in this 
quarter. I would make a trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> with great 
pleasure, if my presence here could be dispensed with 
for a day or two, of which you can best judge.

I am, my dear Sir, with most sincere regard, your 
very obedient and affectionate servant.

</p><p>
MY DEAR HALKET, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a conference with Colonel 
Bouquet. I find him fixed, I think I may say unalterably fixed, to lead you a new way to the Ohio, through a 
road, every inch of which is to be cut at this advanced 
season, when we have scarce time left to tread the 
beaten track, universally confessed to be the best passage through the mountains. 
</p><p>
If Colonel Bouquet succeeds in this point with the 
General, all is lost, all is lost indeed, our enterprise 
will be ruined, and we shall be stopped at the Laurel 
Hill this winter ; but not to gather laurels, except of the 
kind that covers the mountains. The southern Indians 
will turn against us, and these colonies will be desolated by such an accession to the enemy's strength. 
These must be the consequences of a miscarriage ; and 
a miscarriage is the almost necessary consequence of an 
attempt to march the army by this new route. I have 
given my reasons at large to Colonel Bouquet. He desired 
that I would do so, that he might forward them to the 
General. Should this happen, you will be able to judge 
of their weight. 
</p><p>
I am uninfluenced by prejudice, having no hopes or 
fears but for the general good. Of this you may be assured, and that my sincere sentiments are spoken on 
this occasion. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Halket, most affectionately yours.

TO COLONEL BOUQUET. 
</p><p>
Camp, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a>, 2 August, 17. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The matters, of which we spoke relative to the roads, 
have, since our parting, been the subject of my closest 
reflection ; and, so far am I from altering my opinion, 
that, the more time and attention I bestow, the more I 
am confirmed in it ; and the reasons for taking Braddock's road appear in a stronger point of view. To 
enumerate the whole of these reasons would be tedious, 
and to you, who are become so much master of the 
subject, unnecessary. I shall, therefore, briefly mention 
a few only, which I think so obvious in themselves, that 
they must effectually remove objections. 
</p><p>
Several years ago the Virginians and Pennsylvanians 
commenced a trade with the Indians settled on the Ohio, 
and, to obviate the many inconveniences of a bad road, 
they, after reiterated and ineffectual efforts to discover 
where a good one might be made, employed for the purpose several of the most intelligent Indians, who, in the 
course of many years' hunting, had acquired a perfect knowledge of these mountains. The Indians, having taken the greatest pains to gain the rewards offered 
for this discovery, declared, that the path leading from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a> was infinitely preferable to any, that could 
be made at any other place. Time and experience so 
clearly demonstrated this truth, that the Pennsylvania traders commonly carried out their goods by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wills creek" rel="city">Will's Creek</a>. 
Therefore, the Ohio Company, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1753">1753</a>, at a considerable 
expense, opened the road. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a> the troops, whom 
I had the honor to command, greatly repaired it, as far 
as Gist's plantation; and, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1755">1755</a>, it was widened and 
completed by General Braddock to within six miles of Port Duquesne. A road, that has so long been opened, 
and so well and so often repaired, must be much firmer 
and better than a new one, allowing the ground to be 
equally good. 
</p><p>
But, supposing it were practicable to make a road 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> quite as good as General Braddock's, 
I ask, have we time to do it ? Certainly not. To surmount the difficulties to be encountered in making it 
over such mountains, covered with woods and rocks, 
would require so much time, as to blast our otherwise 
well-grounded hopes of striking the important stroke 
this season. 
</p><p>
The favorable accounts, that some give of the forage 
on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> road, as being so much better than 
that on the other, are certainly exaggerated. It is well 
known, that, on both routes, the rich valleys between the 
mountains abound with good forage, and that those, 
which are stony and bushy, are destitute of it. Colonel 
Byrd and the engineer, who accompanied him, confirm 
this fact. Surely the meadows on Braddock's road 
would greatly overbalance the advantage of having grass 
to the foot of the ridge, on the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> road ; and all 
agree, that a more barren road is nowhere to be found, 
than that from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> to the inhabitants, which is likewise to be considered. 
</p><p>
Another principal objection made to General Braddock's road is in regard to the waters. But these seldom swell so much, as to obstruct the passage. The 
Youghiogany River, which is the most rapid and soonest 
filled, I have crossed with a body of troops, after more 
than thirty days' almost continued rain. In fine, any 
difficulties on this score are so trivial, that they really 
are not worth mentioning. The Monongahela, the largest of all these rivers, may, if necessary, easily be 
avoided, as Mr. Frazer the principal guide informs me, by passing a defile, and even that, he says, may be shunned. 
</p><p>
Again, it is said, there are many defiles on this road. 
I grant that there are some, but I know of none that 
may not be traversed ; and I should be glad to be informed where a road can be had, over these mountains, 
not subject to the same inconvenience. The shortness 
of the distance between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a> is 
used as an argument against this road, which bears in it 
something unaccountable to me ; for I must beg leave to 
ask, whether it requires more time, or is more difficult 
and expensive, to go one hundred and forty-five miles 
in a good road already made to our hands, than to cut 
one hundred miles anew, and a great part of the way 
over impassable mountains. 
</p><p>
That the old road is many miles nearer Winchester 
in Virginia, and Fort Frederic in Maryland, than the 
contemplated one, is incontestable ; and I will here show 
the distances from Carlisle by the two routes, fixing the 
different stages, some of which I have from information 
only, but others I believe to be exact From this computation there appears to be a difference of nineteen 
miles only. Were all the supplies necessarily to come 
from Carlisle, it is well known, that the goodness of the 
old road is a sufficient compensation for the shortness 
of the other, as the wrecked and broken wagons there 
clearly demonstrate. 
</p><p>
I shall next give you my reasons against dividing the 
army, in the manner you propose. 
</p><p>
First, then, by dividing our army, we shall divide our 
strength, and, by pursuing quite distinct routes, put it 
entirely out of the power of each division to succour the 
other, as the proposed new road has no communication 
with the old one. 
</p><p>
Secondly, to march in this manner will be attended 
with many inconveniences. If we depart from our advanced posts at the same time, and make no deposits 
by the way, those troops that go from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>, as 
they will be light, with carrying-horses only, will arrive 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a> long before the others, and must, if 
the enemy are strong there, be exposed to many insults 
in their advance, and in their intrenchments, from the 
cannon of the enemy, which they may draw out upon 
them at pleasure. If they are not strong enough to do 
this, we have but little to apprehend from them, in 
whatever way w r e may go. 
</p><p>
Thirdly, if that division, which escorts the convoy, is 
permitted to march first, we risk our all, in a manner, 
and shall be ruined if any accident happens to the artillery and the stores. 
</p><p>
Lastly, if we advance on both roads, by deposits, we 
must double our number of troops over the mountains, 
and distress ourselves by victualling them at these deposits, besides losing the proposed advantage, that of 
stealing a march. For, we cannot suppose that the 
French, who have their scouts constantly out, can be so deficient in point of intelligence, as to be unacquainted 
with our motions, while we are advancing by slow degrees towards them. 
</p><p>
From what has been said relative to the two roads, i 
appears to me very clear, that the old one is infinite! 
better, than the other can be made, and that there is no 
room to hesitate in deciding which to take, when we 
consider the advanced season, and the little time left to 
execute our plan. 
</p><p>
I shall, therefore, in the last place offer, as desired, 
my sentiments on advancing by deposits. The first deposit I should have proposed to be at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=little meadows" rel="city">Little Meadows</a>, had time permitted ; but, as the case now stands, 
I think it should be at the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a>, or the Great 
Meadows. The <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=great crossing" rel="city">Great Crossing</a> I esteem the most advantageous post, on several accounts, especially on 
those of water and security of passage ; but then it does 
not abound with forage, as the Meadows do, nor with so 
much level land fit for culture. To this latter place a 
body of fifteen hundred men may march with three 
hundred wagons (or with carrying-horses, which would 
be much better), allowing each wagon to carry eight 
hundred weight of flour and four hundred of salt meat. 
</p><p>
Our next deposit will probably be at Salt Lick, about 
thirty-five miles from the Meadows. To this place I 
think it necessary to send two thousand five hundred 
men, to construct some post, taking six days' provisions 
only, which is sufficient to serve them till the convoy 
comes up, by which time an entrenched camp, or some 
other defensive work, may be effected. From hence I 
conceive it highly expedient to detach three or four 
thousand of the best troops to invest the fort, and to 
prevent, if possible, an engagement in the woods, which 
of all things ought to be avoided. The artillery and stores may be brought up in four days from Salt Lick. 
</p><p>
From that time I will allow eighteen days more, for the 
carrying-horses to make a trip to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a> for provisions, passing along the old path by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>. They 
may do it in this time, as the horses will go down light 
From this statement, and by my calculations, in which 
large allowance is made for the quantity of provisions, 
as well as for the time of transporting them, it appears 
that, from the day on which the front division begins its 
march, till the whole army arrives before <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, 
will be thirty-four days. There will be, also, eightyseven days' provision on hand, allowing for the consumption on the march. Eighteen days added to the 
above will make fifty-two in all, the number required for 
our operations. These ought to be finished, if possible, 
by the middle of October. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am favored with yours of yesterday, intimating a 
probability of my proceeding with a body of troops, on 
General Braddock's road, and desiring me to retain for 
that purpose a month's provisions at this place, a thing 
I should be extremely fond of; but, as I cannot possibly 
know what quantity of provisions may be necessary for 
that time, without knowing the number of men I may 
probably march with, and when it is likely I may leave 
this place, I hope you will be pleased to give me the 
necessary information on that head ; and, also, how this 
post is to be garrisoned, and what provision and stores 
should be left here.
</p><p>
I have talked a good deal with Kelly upon the nature 
of the intervening ground between the new road and 
Braddock's, and, from what he says, I apprehend it impracticable to effect a junction with the troops on the 
new road, till we advance near the Salt Lick, which is at 
no great distance from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. How far it may 
be advisable to send a small body of troops so near the 
enemy, and at so great a distance from the army, without any tools for repairing the roads, or throwing up any 
kind of defences in case of need, I shall not presume to 
say. But I cannot help observing, that all the guides 
and Indians are to be drawn from hence, and that the greater part of my regiment is on the other road, so that 
I have but few of the first regiment remaining with me, and eight companies of the second only, whose officers 
and men cannot be supposed to know much of the service, or of the country, and nearly, if not quite, a fifth of 
them sick. I thought it incumbent on me to mention these things, that you may know our condition. At the 
same time I beg leave to assure you, that nothing will give me greater pleasure than to proceed with any number of men, that the General or yourself shall think proper to order. 
</p><p>
With regard to keeping out a succession of strong 
parties on this road, from the troops here, I must beg 
leave to remark, that we have not so much as one packhorse upon which to take provisions, having been under 
the necessity the other day of pressing five horses from 
some countrymen, who came to camp upon business, 
before I could equip Captain M c Kenzie's party for a 
fourteen days' inarch. We have not an ounce of salt 
provision of any kind here, and it is impossible to preserve the fresh, especially as we have no salt, by any 
other means than barbacuing it in the Indian manner. 
In doing this, nearly half is lost, so that a party receiving 
ten days' provisions will be obliged to live upon little 
better than five days' allowance of meat, a thing impracticable. 
</p><p>
A great many of Colonel Byrd's men are very sickly ; 
the rest are become dejected. This sickness and depression of spirits cannot arise from the situation of our 
camp, which is undoubtedly the most healthy of any 
ground in this vicinity, but is occasioned, I apprehend, 
by the change in their mode of living, and by the limestone water. The soldiers of the first regiment, like 
those of the second, would be sickly, were it not owing to some such causes. 
</p><p>
We have reason to believe, that parties of the enemy are about us, a wagoner having been shot yesterday 
afternoon, and his horse killed under him, not more than three miles from this place. 
</p><p>
We have no Indian goods of any kind here. It gives me great pleasure to learn, that the General is getting 
better, and is expected soon at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=raystown" rel="city">Raystown</a>. I am, &,c.

Twenty-five Catawbas came here this evening, and

Governor Sharpe may be expected here in a day or

know, nor whether he has any out of the troops of his

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
We are still encamped here, very sickly, and quite 
dispirited at the prospect before us. 
</p><p>
That appearance of glory, which we had once in 
view, that hope, that laudable ambition of serving our 
country, and meriting its applause, are now no more ; 
all is dwindled into ease, sloth, and fatal inactivity. In 
a word, all is lost, if the ways of men in power, like 
certain ways of Providence, are not inscrutable. But 
we, who view the actions of great men at a distance, 
can only form conjectures agreeably to a limited perception ; and, being ignorant of the comprehensive 
schemes, which may be in contemplation, might mistake 
egregiously in judging of things from appearances, or by 
the lump. Yet every fool will have his notions, will 
prattle and talk away ; and why may not I ? We seem 
then, in my opinion, to act under the guidance of an evil 
genius. The conduct of our leaders, if not actuated by 
superior orders, is tempered with something, I do not 
care to give a name to. Nothing now but a miracle can 
bring this campaign to a happy issue. 
</p><p>
In my last, if I remember rightly, I told you, that I 
had employed my small abilities in opposing the measures then concerting. To do this, I not only represented the advanced season, the difficulty of cutting a 
new road over these mountains, the short time left for that service, the moral certainty of its obstructing our 
march, and the consequent miscarriage of the expedition ; I endeavoured to represent, also, the hard struggle 
Virginia had made this year in raising a second regiment 
upon so short a notice, the great expense of doing it, 
and her inability for future exertion. I spoke my fears 
concerning the southern Indians, in the event of a miscarriage. But I spoke all unavailingly, for the road was 
immediately begun, and from one to two thousand men 
have since constantly wrought upon it. By the last accounts I have received, they had cut it to the foot of 
Laurel Hill, about thirty-five miles ; and I suppose by 
this time fifteen hundred men have taken post at a place 
called <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, about ten miles further, where our 
next fort is intended to be constructed. 
</p><p>
We have certain intelligence, that the French strength 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, on the 13th ultimo, did not exceed 
eight hundred men, Indians included, of whom there 
appeared to be about three or four hundred. This account is corroborated on all hands. Two officers of the 
first Virginia regiment, Chew and Allen, have since 
come from thence, both in different parties, and at different times, after lying a day or two concealed in full 
view of the fort, and observing the motions and strength 
of the enemy. See, therefore, how our time has been 
misspent. Behold how the golden opportunity has been 
lost, perhaps never more to be regained ! How is it to 
be accounted for'] Can General Forbes have orders 
for this ? Impossible. Will, then, our injured country 
pass by such abuses 1 I hope not. Rather let a full 
representation of the matter go to his Majesty. Let 
him know how grossly his glory and interest, and the 
public money, have been prostituted. I wish I were 
sent immediately home [to England], as an aid to some 
other on this errand. I think, without vanity, I could set the conduct of this expedition in its true colors, 
having taken some pains, perhaps more than any other man, to dive to the bottom of it. But no more.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
In consequence of your request of the Colonels assembled at your lodgings, the 15th ultimo, I offer these 
plans to your consideration. They express my thoughts 
respecting a line of march through a country covered 
with woods, and how that line of march may be formed quickly into an order of battle. The plan of the order 
of march and order of battle, on the other side, is calculated for a forced march with field-pieces only, unincumbered with wagons. It represents, first, a line of march ; 
and, secondly, how that line of march may in an instant be thrown into an order of battle in the woods. This 
plan supposes four thousand privates, one thousand of whom, picked men, are to march in the front in three 
divisions, each division having a field-officer to command it, besides the commander of the whole ; and always to 
be in readiness to oppose the enemy, whose attack, if the necessary precautions are observed, must always be in front. 
</p><p>
The first division must, as the second and third likewise ought to be, subdivided for the captains ; these 
subdivisions to be again divided for the subalterns ; and 
the subalterns again for the sergeants and corporals. By 
which means every non-commissioned officer will hav 
a party to command, under the eye of a subaltern, as 
the subalterns will have, under the direction of a captain. 
</p><p>
I shall, though I believe it unnecessary, remark here, 
that the captains, when their subdivisions are again divided, are to take command of no particular part of it, 
but to attend to the whole subdivision, as the subalterns 
are to do with theirs, each captain and subaltern acting as commandant of the division he is appointed to, 
under the field-officer, visiting and encouraging all parts 
alike, and keeping the soldiers to their duty. This 
being done, the first division, so soon as the van-guard 
is attapked (if that gives the first notice of the enemy's 
approach), is to file off to the right and left, and take to 
trees, gaining the enemy's flanks, and surrounding the 
as described in the second plan. The flank-guards the right, which belong to the second division, are immediately to extend to the right, followed by that division, and to form, as described in the aforesaid plan. 
The rear-guard division is to follow the left flankers in 
the same manner, in order, if possible, to encompass the 
enemy, which being a practice different from any thing 
they have ever yet experienced from us, I think may be 
accomplished. Such Indians as we have, should be 
ordered to get round, unperceived, and fall at the same 
time upon the enemy's rear. The front and rear being 
thus secured, a body of two thousand five hundred men 
remains to form two brigades, on the flanks of w r hich 
six hundred men must march for their safety, and in 
such order as to form a rank entire, by only marching 
the captains' and subalterns' guards into the intervals 
between the sergeants' parties. The main body will 
now be reduced to nineteen hundred men, who should 
be kept as a corps de reserve to support any part, that 
shall be found weak or forced.

The whole is submitted with the utmost candor, by

I am sorry to inform you, that, upon reviewing the

been separated from me since my last, I found them deficient in the necessaries contained in the enclosed

My march to this post gave me an opportunity ot 
forming a judgment of the road, and I can truly say, 
that it is indescribably bad. Had it not been for an 
accidental discovery of a new passage over the Laurel 
Hill, the carriages must inevitably have stopped on the 
other side. This fact nobody here takes upon him to 
deny. The General and great part of the troops being 
yet behind, and the weather growing very inclement, I 
apprehend our expedition must terminate for this year 
at this place. But as our affairs are now drawing to a 
crisis, and a good or bad conclusion of them will shortly 
ensue, I choose to suspend my judgment, as well as a 
further account of the matter, to a future day.

An express from Colonel Armstrong affords me an 
opportunity of informing you, that we arrived here about 
four o'clock this afternoon. I immediately ordered working parties on the road, that no time might be lost in 
working it ; but I fear I shall not proceed so fast as you

These, and the others that are here, shall be employed

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
After the most constant labor from daybreak till night, 
we were able to open the road only as far as this place, 
about six miles from our last camp. Captain Shelby 
here overtook us, and presented me with your and 
Colonel Bouquet's letters. A junction with Colonel 
Armstrong this morning would have prevented the good 
effects of a fortified camp to-night, and retarded our 
operations a day at least ; for which reason I desired him to march forward this morning at two o'clock, and 
secure himself, as you desired. If he accomplishes that 
work before night, he is to begin opening the road towards me. 
</p><p>
If Indians can ever be of any use to us, it must be 
now, in the front, for intelligence. I beg you will, therefore, order their conductors to bring them at all events. 
</p><p>
Camp, at night. Colonel Bouquet's letter came to 
my hands, just as the bearer was passing by, from 
Colonel Armstrong. I shall punctually observe all its 
directions, although I at the same time confess, that I 
think it would have been much safer and more eligible 
to march briskly forward to our second post, leaving the 
road for Colonel Montgomery to open. We should by 
that means have been a covering party to him, while we 
are fortifying a camp, which may be of great importance 
to the army. Less time would be lost in this way, and 
a straggling front, which will ever happen in expeditious 
cutting, would be avoided ; besides the probable advantage of getting into a secure camp before we should be 
discovered. 
</p><p>
I have opened the road between seven and eight 
miles to day, and am yet three miles short of Colonel 
Armstrong, who marched at eight o'clock. I understand 
by Captain Shelby, who is just come from him, that he 
has not yet begun entrenching his camp, which must 
again retard us to-morrow. Forwarding provisions is 
highly necessary ; hard labor consumes them fast ; but 
all the men are in high spirits, and are anxious to go on. 
</p><p>
I shall be much pleased to see the Indians up, and 
am very glad ta hear that Mr. Croghan is so near at 
hand. The number with him is not mentioned. I wish 
they also were in our front.

Armstrong's Camp, 18 November, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1758">1758</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I came to this camp about eleven o'clock to-day, having 
opened the road before me. I should immediately have 
proceeded on, but, as the bullocks were to be slaughtered, 
and provisions dressed, I thought it expedient to halt 
here till three in the morning, when I shall begin to 
march with one thousand men, leaving Colonel Armstrong and five hundred more in this camp, until Colonel 
Montgomery joins him. I took care that the road 
should not be delayed by this halt, for I ordered out a 
working party, properly covered, before I came here, to 
cut it forward till night, and then return. 
</p><p>
I fear that we have been greatly deceived, with regard to the distance from this place to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>. 
Most of the woods-men, that I have conversed with, 
seem to think that we are still thirty miles from it. I 
have sent out a party in that direction to ascertain the 
distance, and the kind of ground to be passed over, and 
two others to scout on the right and left, for the discovery of tracks. 
</p><p>
I found three redoubts erecting for the defence of this 
camp. Mr. Gordon thinks, that it will be sufficiently 
secured by these means ; but, for my own part, I do not 
look upon redoubts alone, in this close country, to be 
half as good as the slightest breastwork ; indeed, I do 
not believe they are any security at all without other 
works. 
</p><p>
I enclose you a return of the total strength of this 
place, and the time for which we are served with provisions, by which you will see how much a supply is 
needed. I must beg, that commissaries and steelyards 
may be sent forward, otherwise a continual dissatisfaction will prevail, as well on the part of the contractors, 
as on that of the soldiers, who think they have injustice 
done them in their allowance, notwithstanding that the 
fifteen bullocks, which were received as provisions for 
four days, were issued for three only, by the judgment 
of an officer from each corps, as well as my own, for I 
took pains to examine into it myself. 
</p><p>
I had written thus far, when your favor of this morning came to hand. I shall set out at three o'clock, as 
above, leaving the Highlanders to finish the redoubts, 
according to Mr. Gordon's plan, and to secure the tools, 
until Colonel Montgomery comes up, submitting it then 
to Colonel Bouquet's opinion to bring or leave them. 
</p><p>
Your chimney at this place is finished. I shall take 
care to put up one at the next post.  
</p><p>
I shall use every necessary precaution to get timely 
notice of the enemy's approach, so that I flatter myself 
you need be under no apprehensions on that head. A 
scouting party is just returned, and reports, that, five 
miles advanced, thay discovered the tracks of about 
forty persons making towards Kiskemanetas. The 
tracks appear to have been made to-day, or yesterday.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, or the ground rather on which it stood, was 
possessed by his Majesty's troops on the 25th instant. 
The enemy, after letting us get within a day's march of the place, burned the fort, and ran away by the light of 
it, at night, going down the Ohio by water, to the number of about five hundred men, according to our best 
information. This possession of the fort has been matter of surprise to the whole army, and we cannot attribute it to more probable causes, than the weakness of 
the enemy, want of provisions, and the defection of their 
Indians. Of these circumstances we were luckily informed by three prisoners, who providentially fell into 
our hands at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=loyal hanna" rel="city">Loyal Hanna</a>, when we despaired of proceeding further. A council of war had determined, that 
it was not advisable to advance this season beyond that 
place; but the above information caused us to march on 
without tents or baggage, and with only a light train of 
artillery. We have thus happily succeeded. It would 
be tedious, and I think unnecessary, to relate every 
trivial circumstance, that has happened since my last 
To do this, if needful, shall be the employment of a 
leisure hour, when I shall have the pleasure to pay my 
respects to your Honor. 
</p><p>
The General intends to wait here a few days to settle 
matters with the Indians, and then all the troops, except 
a sufficient garrison to secure the place, will march to 
their respective governments. I give your Honor this 
early notice, that your directions relative to the troops 
of Virginia may meet me on the road. I cannot help 
reminding you, in this place, of the hardships they have 
undergone, and of their present naked condition, that 
you may judge if it is not essential for them to have 
some little recess from fatigue, and time to provide 
themselves with necessaries. At present they- are destitute of every comfort of life. If I do not get your orders 
to the contrary, I shall march the troops under my command directly to Winchester. They may then be disposed of, as you shall afterwards direct. 
</p><p>
General Forbes desires me to inform you, that he is 
prevented, by a multiplicity of affairs, from writing to 
you so fully now, as he would otherwise have done. 
He has written to the commanding officers stationed on 
the communication from hence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=winchester" rel="city">Winchester</a>, relative 
to the conduct of the Little Carpenter, a chief of the 
Cherokees, the purport of which was to desire, that 
they would escort him from one place to another, to 
prevent his doing any mischief to the inhabitants. 
</p><p>
This fortunate, and, indeed, unexpected success of 
our arms will be attended with happy effects. The 
Delawares are suing for peace, and I doubt not that 
other tribes on the Ohio will follow their example. A 
trade, free, open, and on equitable terms, is what they 
seem much to desire, and I do not know so effectual a 
way of riveting them to our interest, as by sending out 
goods immediately to this place for that purpose. It 
will, at the same time, be a means of supplying the garrision with such necessaries as may be wanted ; and, I 
think, the other colonies, which are as greatly interested 
in the support of this place as Virginia, should neglect 
no means in their power to establish and maintain a 
strong garrison here. Our business, without this precaution, will be but half finished ; while, on the other 
hand, we shall obtain a firm and lasting peace with the 
Indians, if this end is once accomplished. 
</p><p>
General Forbes is very assiduous in getting these 
matters settled upon a solid basis, and has great merit 
for the happy issue to which he has brought our affairs, 
infirm and worn down as he is. At present I have 
nothing further to add, but the strongest assurances of 
my being your Honor's most obedient and most humble 
servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The enclosed was written with the intention of sending it by the General's express, but his indisposition 
prevented that express from setting out for three days 
afterwards ; and the General thought, that my waiting 
upon your Honor would be more eligible, as I could represent the situation of our affairs in this quarter more 
fully, than could well be done by letter. This I accordingly attempted ; but, upon trial, I found it impracticable 
to proceed with despatch, for want of horses, having 
now nearly two hundred miles to march before I can 
get a supply, and those at present in use being entirely 
disabled. I shall, notwithstanding, endeavour to comply 
with the General's request, but I cannot possibly be 
down till towards the 1st of next month^ and the bearer 
may arrive much sooner. 
</p><p>
The General has, in his letters, told you what garrison he proposed to leave at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort duquesne" rel="city">Fort Duquesne</a>, but the 
want of provisions rendered it impossible to leave more 
than two hundred men in all ; and these, without great 
exertions, must, I fear, abandon the place or perish. 
To prevent, as far as possible, either of these events, I 
have by this conveyance written a circular letter to the 
back inhabitants of Virginia, setting forth the great advantages of keeping that place, the improbability of doing it without their immediate assistance, that they may 
travel safely out while we hold that post, and that they 
will be allowed good prices for such provisions as they 
may carry. Unless the most effectual means shall be 
taken early in the spring to reinforce the garrison, the 
place will inevitably be lost, and then our frontiers will fall 
into the same distressed condition as heretofore. I can very confidently assert, that we never can secure them 
properly, if we again lose our footing on the Ohio, since 
we shall thereby lose the interest of the Indians. I therefore think, that every necessary preparation should be 
made, and not a moment lost in adopting the most 
speedy and efficacious measures, for securing the advantages to be derived from our holding possession of 
that important country. 
</p><p>
The preparatory steps should immediately be taken 
for preserving the communication from Virginia, by constructing a post at Red-stone Creek, which w r ould 
greatly facilitate the supplying of our troops on the Ohio, 
where a formidable garrison should be sent, as soon as 
the season will admit. A trade with the Indians should 
be established upon such terms, and transacted by men 
of such principle, as would at the same time redound to 
the reciprocal advantage of the colony and the Indians, 
and effectually remove the bad impressions, which the Indians have received from the conduct of a set of villains, 
divested of all faith and honor, and give us such an early 
opportunity of establishing an interest with them, as 
would ensure to us a large share of the fur-trade, not 
only of the Ohio Indians, but, in time, of the numerous 
nations possessing the back country westward. To 
prevent this advantageous commerce from suffering in 
its infancy, by the sinister views of designing, selfish 
men in the different provinces, I humbly conceive it advisable, that commissioners from each of the colonies 
should be appointed to regulate the mode of that trade, 
and fix it on such a basis, that all the attempts of one 
colony to undermine another, and thereby weaken and 
diminish the general system, might be frustrated. 
</p><p>
Although no one can entertain a higher sense of the 
great importance of maintaining a post on the Ohio than 
myself, yet, considering the present circumstances of my regiment, I would by no means have agreed to leave 
any part of it there, had not the General given an express order. I endeavoured to show, that the King's 
troops ought to garrison it ; but he told me, that, as he 
had no instructions from the ministry relative to this 
point, he could not order it. Our men, left there, are in 
such a miserable condition, having hardly rags to cover 
their nakedness, and exposed to the inclemency of the 
weather in this rigorous season, that, unless provision is 
made by the country for supplying them immediately, 
they must perish. If the first Virginia regiment is to be 
kept up any longer, or any services are expected from 
it, the men should forthwith be clothed. By their present nakedness, the advanced season, and the inconceivable fatigues of an uncommonly long and laborious 
campaign, they are rendered totally incapable of any 
kind of service ; and sickness, death, and desertion 
must, if they are not speedily supplied, greatly reduce 
their numbers. To replace them with equally good 
men will, perhaps, be found impossible.

My last letters would fully inform your Honor of the

As the Governor writes fully to you, respecting the

were of opinion, that, as they had met so lately, and 
were summoned to attend some time in February, it 
would be inconvenient to convene them sooner ; so that 
no measures for securing the communication between

Captain M c Neil, who commanded the first Virginia

particulars, but I believe, from the accounts received, 
that Mr. Hoops was equally culpable in detaining the

I am told, is likely to bring M c Neil into trouble. I therefore beg the favor of you, Sir, as I am well convinced 
M c Neil had nothing in view but the welfare of his men, 
to interpose your kind offices to settle the difference. 
This will be doing a favor to Captain M c Neil, as well as

the above change, and at the same time to acquaint you, 
that I shall continue to make you the same consignments of tobacco as usual, and will endeavour to increase 
them in proportion as I find myself and the estate benefited thereby.

The scarcity of the last year's crop, and the consequent high prices of tobacco, would, in any other case, 
have induced me to sell the estate's crop in this country; but, for a present, and I hope small advantage only, 
I did not care to break the chain of correspondence, 
that has so long subsisted.

On the other side is an invoice of some goods, which 
I beg you to send me by the first ship, bound either to for the honor ; but such was his trepidation and confusion, that he could not 
give distinct utterance to a syllable. He blushed, stammered, and trembled, for a second ; when the Speaker relieved him, by a stroke of address, 
that would have done honor to Louis the Fourteenth, in his proudest and 
happiest moment. ' Sit down, Mr. Washington,' said he, with a conciliating smile, your modesty is equal to your valor, and that surpasses the

 The product of Washington's plantations was at this period almost 
exclusively tobacco. This he usually exported to London for a market, 
making the shipments in his own name, and putting the tobacco on board 
the vessels, which came up the river to his mansion at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, or 
to such other point as was most convenient. In those days, also, it was 
the practice of the Virginia planters to send to London for all the articles 
of common use. Twice a year Washington forwarded a list of such articles to his agent, comprising not only all the necessaries and conveniences for household purposes, but likewise every article of wearing apparel 
for himself and each member of his family, specifying the names of each, 
and the ages of Mrs. Washington's two children, as also the size, description, and quality of the articles. He then required his agent to send him, 
in addition to a general bill of the whole, the original voucher of each one 
of the persons from whom purchases were made. So minute and particular 
was he in these concerns, that for many years he entered with his own 
hand, in books prepared for the purpose, all the long lists of orders, and 
copies of the multifarious receipts from the different tradesmen, merchants, 
and mechanics in London, who had supplied the goods. In this way he 
kept a perfect oversight of the business, and could tell when any advantage was taken of him even in the smallest matter, of which he did not 
fail to remind his agent the next time he wrote. As the price obtained for 
his tobacco depended on the judgment, fidelity, and efforts of the agent in 
effecting sales, he would sometimes divide the agency, sending part to one 
person, and part to another, and, by comparing the results, he could detect 
any inattention or mismanagement, which had been unfavorable to his 
interest.

things good and fashionable in their several kinds, we often have articles 
sent us, that could only have been used by our forefathers in days of yore.

SIR, 
</p><p>
In a letter which I wrote you the 1st of last month, 
was enclosed an invoice of sundries, which I then was 
and still am much in need of. If those goods should 
not be shipped before this letter gets to hand, pray add 
to your purchase the things, which you will find on the 
other side, and send them as there directed. 
</p><p>
I shall find occasion to write you fully by the fleet, 
and shall enclose a list of sundries, that will be wanted 
for the estate's use. Till then I shall forbear to trouble you with particulars, as I shall expect also by that 
time to receive some account of the sales of the estate's tobacco sent you, and an account current. As 
this last is necessary for me to compare with my own 
account, in order to a satisfactory settlement with our 
General Court, I entreat you to be punctual in sending 
me one every spring and fall yearly. 
</p><p>
I shall keep the estate under the same direction as formerly, neither altering the managers, the kind of tobacco, 
nor the manner of treating it, unless you advise otherwise for our interest. And, while I continue to pursue this 
method, I hope you will be able to render such sales, as 
will not only justify the present consignments to you, 
but encourage my enlarging them ; for I shall be candid 
in telling you, that duty to the charge with which I am 
entrusted, as well as self-interest, will incline me to 
abide by those, who give the greatest proof of their abilities in selling my own and the estate's tobacco, and purchasing our goods, of which I can no otherwise judge, 
than by the accounts that will be rendered. And here 
permit me to ask, if it would be advisable to change the 
marks of any of the tobacco, or had I best ship it all 
under the usual marks ? If so, my part may be known 
by some small distinction, such as you can best advise. 
</p><p>
In my last, among other things, I desired you would 
send me, besides a small octavo volume, the best system 
now extant of agriculture. Since then, I have been told, 
that there is one, lately published, done by various hands, 
but chiefly collected from the papers of Mr. Hale. If 
this is known to be the best, pray send it, but not if any 
other is in higher esteem. I am, &c.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you will receive a bill, which please to accept, and place to my credit. Since my last, your 
agreeable favor, covering an invoice of sundries, has 
come to hand, as have the goods also, in good order ; 
which is more than most of the importers by that ship 
can boast, great part of her cargo being damaged, 
through the negligence, it is said, of the captain.

My brother is safely arrived, and but little benefited in point of health by his trip to England. The longing 
desire, which for many years I have had, of visiting the 
great metropolis of that kingdom, is not in the least 
abated by his prejudices, because I think the small share 
of health he enjoyed, while there, must have given a 
check to any pleasures he might anticipate, and would 
render any place irksome ; but I am now tied, and must 
set inclination aside. 
</p><p>
The scale of fortune in America is turned greatly in 
our favor, and success has become the companion of our 
fortunate generals. It \vould be folly in me to attempt 
particularizing their actions, since you receive accounts 
in a channel so much more direct than from hence. 
</p><p>
I am now, I believe, fixed at this seat with an agreeable partner for life, and I hope to find more happiness in 
retirement, than I ever experienced amidst the wide and 
bustling world. I thank you heartily for your affectionate wishes. Why will you not give me an occasion of 
congratulating you in the same manner 1 None would 
do it more cordially than, dear Sir, your most obedient

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The French are so well drubbed, and seem so much 
humbled in America, that I apprehend our generals will 
find it no difficult matter to reduce Canada to our obedience this summer. But what may be Montgomery's 
fate in the Cherokee country I cannot so readily determine. It seems he has made a prosperous beginning, 
having penetrated into the heart of the country, and he 
is now advancing his troops in high health and spirits to 
the relief of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort loudoun" rel="city">Fort Loudoun</a>. But let him be wary. He 
has a crafty, subtle enemy to deal with, that may give 
him most trouble when he least expects it. We are 
in pain here for the king of Prussia, and wish Hanover 
safe, these being events in which we are much interested. 
</p><p>
My indulging myself in a trip to England depends 
upon so many contingencies, which, in all probability, 
may never occur, that I dare not even think of such a 
gratification. Nothing, however, is more ardently desired. But Mrs. Washington and myself would both 
think ourselves very happy in the opportunity of showing you the Virginia hospitality, which is the most agreeable entertainment we can give, or a stranger expect to 
find, in an infant, woody country, like ours.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Had your favor of the 17th of August come to 
my hands before the 18th instant, I should not have 
given you the trouble of perusing my answer to it at 
this late season. I am sorry, that you should think it 
necessary to introduce a request to me, which is founded 
on reason and equity, with an apology. Had you claimed that as a right, which you seem to ask as a favor, I 
should have thought myself wanting in that justice, 
which is the distinguishing characteristic of an honest 
man, to have withheld it from you. 
</p><p>
But how to answer your purposes, and at the same 
time to avoid the imputation of impertinence, I am, I 
confess, more at a loss to determine. That General 
Amherst may have heard of such a person as I am, is 
probable, and this I dare venture to say is the chief 
knowledge he has of me. How then should I appear 
to him in an epistolary way ? And to sit down and 
write a certificate of your behaviour carries with it an 
air of formality, that seems more adapted to the case of 
a soldier than that of an officer. I must, therefore, beg 
the favor of you to make what use you please of this 
letter. 
</p><p>
For, Sir, with not more pleasure than truth, I can 
declare to you and the world, that while I had the honor 
of commanding the regiment, your conduct, both as an 
officer and a gentleman, was unexceptionable, and in 
every instance, as far as I was capable of discerning, 
such as to merit applause from better judges. Since 
my time, Colonel Byrd has been witness to your 
behaviour, and his letter recommendatory must, I am 
persuaded, do you more service than my sanguine endeavours. Although neither he, nor any other person, 
is more sensible of your worth, or more inclined to contribute his best offices to the completion of your wishes, 
than, Sir, your obedient servant.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have had the pleasure of receiving 
your obliging favors of the 16th of October and 1st 
of January. A mixture of bad health and indolence 
has kept me, till this time, from paying that due respect 
to your letters, which they merited at my hands ; and 
now, having nothing to relate that could in any wise 
claim your attention, I was still inclined to a further 
delay. 
</p><p>
The entire conquest of Canada, and of the French 
in most parts of North America, being a story too stale 
to relate in these days, we are often at a loss for something with which to fill our letters. True it is, the 
Cherokee nation, by a perfidious conduct, has caused 
Colonel Grant to be sent once more into their country 
with an armed force ; but I believe supplies from the 
French on Mobile River come in so slowly, that they are 
more sincerely disposed to peace now than ever they 
were before. This pacific turn may be caused in some 
measure, too, by another regiment in the pay of this 
colony, which is ordered to penetrate into their country 
by a different passage. But it is generally thought, that 
their submission will put a stop to any further progress of our arms.
</p><p>
We have received the account of the reduction of 
Belle Isle, and we hear of another fleet destined for 
some service, of which we are ignorant. But that, 
which most engrosses our attention at this time, is the 
congress at Augsburg, as I believe nothing is more sincerely desired in this part of tne world, than an honorable peace. I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, of the 14th of July, I have in appearance been very near my last breath. My indisposition 
increased upon me, and I fell into a very low and dangerous state. I once thought the grim king would 
certainly master my utmost efforts, and that I must sink, 
in spite of a resolute struggle ; but, thank God, I have 
now got the better of the disorder, and shall soon be restored, I hope, to perfect health again. 
</p><p>
I do not know, that I can muster up one tittle of news 
to communicate. In short, the occurrences of this part 
of the world are at present scarce worth reciting ; for, 
as we live in a state of peaceful tranquility ourselves, so 
we are at very little trouble to inquire after the operations against the Cherokees, who are the only people 
that disturb the repose of this great continent, and who, 
I believe, would gladly accommodate differences upon 
almost any terms ; not, I conceive, from any apprehensions they are under, on account of our arms, but because they want the supplies, with which we and we 
only can furnish them. We catch the reports of peace 
with gaping mouths, and every person seems anxious 
for a confirmation of that desirable event, provided it 
comes, as no doubt it will, upon honorable terms. 
</p><p>
On the other side is an invoice of clothes, which I 
beg the favor of you to purchase for me, and to send 
them by the first ship bound to this river. As they are 
designed for wearing- apparel for myself, I have committed the choice of them to your fancy, having the best 
opinion of your taste. I want neither lace nor embroidery. Plain clothes, with gold or silver buttons, if worn 
in genteel dress, are all that I desire. I have hitherto 
had my clothes made by one Charles Lawrence. 
Whether it be the fault of the tailor, or of the measure 
sent, I cannot say, but, certain it is, my clothes have 
never fitted me well. I therefore leave the choice of 
the workman to you. I enclose a measure, and, for a 
further direction, I think it not amiss to add, that my 
stature is six feet ; otherwise rather slender than corpulent. I am very sincerely, dear Sir, your most affectionate humble servant.

they have been soliciting peace for some time past. I 
wish the powers of Europe were as well disposed to an

DEAR STEWART, 
</p><p>
With some difficulty I have at last procured the enclosed, which you will please to make use of as occasion 
may require. I was upon the point of forwarding these, 
and my letters to London, when Colonel Hunter arrived, 
and informed me that he left you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and 
that your embarkation for England seemed to be a matter of doubt. I have, therefore, changed the route of 
these letters, now sending them to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, to the 
care of Mr. Beverley Robinson. 
</p><p>
Signing the definitive treaty seems to be the only 
piece of news, which prevails here at present, and diffuses general joy. Our Assembly is suddenly called, in 
consequence of a memorial of the British merchants to 
the Board of Trade, representing the evil consequences 
of our paper emission, and their Lordships' report and 
orders thereupon, which, I suppose, will set the whole 
country in flames. This stir of the merchants seems to 
be ill-timed, and cannot be attended with any good effects, but, I fear, the contrary. However, on the 19th

</p><p>
MY DEAR STEWART, 
</p><p>
By Captain Walter Stewart I am favored with an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of 
the 6th of June, and at the same time of forwarding the 
copy of my former one, which was in readiness before 
that came to hand, and which I incline to send, notwithstanding the original has reached you, because it contains the second bills, arid other matters entire as they 
ought to have been sent, and as I dare say Mr. Stewart 
will be so good as to deliver them. 
</p><p>
Another tempest has arisen upon our frontiers, and 
the alarm spread wider than ever. In short, the inhabitants are so apprehensive of danger, that no families 
remain above the Conococheague road, and many are 
gone below it. Their harvests are in a manner lost, and 
the distresses of the settlement are evident and manifold. In Augusta many people have been killed, and 
numbers fled. Confusion and despair prevail in every 
quarter. At this instant a calm is taking place, which 
forebodes some mischief to Colonel Bouquet. At least 
those, who wish well to the convoy, are apprehensive 
for him ; since it is not unlikely, that the retreat of all 
the Indian parties at one and the same time from our 
frontiers, is a proof of their assembling a force somewhere, and for some particular purpose, and none more 
likely than to oppose his march.
</p><p>
It was expected, that our Assembly would have been 
called, in such exigences as these ; but it is concluded, 
as I have been informed, that an Assembly without 
money would be no eligible plan. To comprehend the 
meaning of this expression you must know, that the 
Board of Trade, at the instance of the British merchants, have undertaken to rebuke us in the most ample 
manner for our paper emissions ; and therefore the Governor and Council have directed one thousand militia to 
be employed for the protection of the frontiers, five 
hundred of whom are to be drafted from Hampshire 
and other counties, and to be under the command 
of Colonel Stephen, whose military courage and capacity, says the Governor, are well established. The 
other five hundred, from the southern frontier counties, 
are to be conducted by Major Lewis ; so that you may 
readily conceive what an enormous expense must attend these measures. Stephen, immediately upon the 
Indians' retiring, advanced to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fort cumberland" rel="city">Fort Cumberland</a> with two 
hundred or two hundred and fifty militia, and will doubtless achieve some signal advantage, of which the public 
will soon be informed. 
</p><p>
I think I have now communicated the only news, 
which these parts afford. It is of a melancholy nature, indeed, and we cannot tell how or when the affair will end. I hope you may have got matters settled 
to your liking before this time. I should rejoice to hear 
it, as I should at every thing that gives you pleasure or 
profit.

SIR, 
</p><p>
The enclosed is a copy of my last. We have been 
curiously entertained, of late, with the description of an 
engine lately constructed, I believe, in Switzerland, and 
which has undergone some improvements in England, 
for taking up trees by the roots. It is related, that trees 
of a considerable diameter are forced up by this engine ; 
that six hands, in working one of them, will raise two or 
three hundred trees in the space of a day ; and that an 
acre of ground may be eased of the trees, and laid fit 
for ploughing, in the same time. How far these assertions have been realized by repeated experiment, it is 
impossible for me at this distance to determine ; but, if 
the accounts are not greatly exaggerated, such powerful 
assistance must be of vast utility in many parts of this 
woody country, where it is impossible for our force (and 
laborers are not to be hired here), between the finishing 
of one crop and the preparation for another, to clear 
ground fast enough to afford the proper changes, eithei 
in the planting or farming business. 
</p><p>
The chief purport of this letter, therefore, is to beg 
fhe favor of you to make minute inquiries into the trials, 
that have been made by order of the Society, and, ii 
they have proved satisfactory, to send me one of thes< 
engines by the first ship bound to the Potomac Rivei 
If they are made of different sizes, I should prefer on< 
of a middle size, capable of raising a tree of fifteen or 
eighteen inches diameter. The cost I am a stranger to. 
Fifteen, twenty, and twenty -five guineas have been 
mentioned ; but the price, were it double these sums, I 
should totally disregard, provided the engine is capable 
of performing what is related of it, and not of that complicated nature, which would cause it to be easily disordered, and rendered unfit for use, but constructed 
upon so plain, simple, and durable a plan, that the common artificers of this country may be able to repair it, if 
any accidents should happen. Should you send me 
one, be so good as to let me have with it the most ample directions for its use, together with a model of its 
manner of operating. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
You will permit me, after six years' silence (the time 
I have been married to your niece), to pay my respects 
to you in this epistolary way. I shall think myself 
happy in beginning a correspondence, which cannot but 
be attended with pleasure on my side. 
</p><p>
I should hardly have taken the liberty, Sir, of introducing myself to your acquaintance in this manner, had 
not a letter from Mr. Robert Gary given me reasons to 
believe, that such an advance on my part would not be 
altogether disagreeable to you. If I could flatter myself, that you would in anywise be entertained with the 
few occurrences, that it may be in my power to relate, 
I should endeavour to atone for my past remissness, in 
this respect, by future punctuality. 
</p><p>
At present there are few things among us, that can 
be interesting to you. The Stamp Act, imposed on the 
colonies by the Parliament of Great Britain, engrosses 
the conversation of the speculative part of the colonists, 
who look upon this unconstitutional method of taxation, 
as a direful attack upon their liberties, and loudly exclaim against the violation. What may be the result of 
this, and of some other (I think I may add ill-judged) 
measures, I will not undertake to determine ; but this I 
may venture to affirm, that the advantage accruing to 
the mother country will fall greatly short of the expectations of the ministry ; for certain it is, that our whole 
substance already in a manner flows to Great Britain, 
and that whatsoever contributes to lessen our importations must be hurtful to her manufacturers. The eyes 
of our people already begin to be opened ; and they will 
perceive, that many luxuries, for which we lavish our 
substance in Great Britain, can well be dispensed with, 
whilst the necessaries of life are mostly to be had within 
ourselves. This, consequently, will introduce frugality, 
and be a necessary incitement to industry. If Great 
Britain, therefore, loads her manufactures with heavy 
taxes, will it not facilitate such results ? They will not 
compel us, I think, to give our money for their exports, 
whether we will or not ; and I am certain, that none of 
their traders will part with them without a valuable 
consideration. Where, then, is the utility of these restrictions 1 
</p><p>
As to the Stamp Act, regarded in a single view, one 
and the first bad consequence attending it, is, that our 
courts of judicature must inevitably be shut up ; for it is 
impossible, or next to impossible, under our present circumstances, that the act of Parliament can be complied 
with, were we ever so willing to enforce its execution. 
And, not to say (which alone would be sufficient) that 
we have not money to pay for the stamps, there are 
many other cogent reasons, which prove that it would 
be ineffectual. If a stop be put to our judicial proceedings, I fancy the merchants of Great Britain, trading to 
the colonies, will not be among the last to wish for a repeal of the act.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Unseasonable as it may be, to take any notice of the repeal of the Stamp Act at this time, yet I cannot help 
observing, that a contrary measure would have introduced very unhappy consequences. Those, therefore, 
who wisely foresaw such an event, and were instrumental in procuring the repeal of the act, are, in my 
opinion, deservedly entitled to the thanks of the wellwishers to Britain and her colonies, and must reflect 
with pleasure, that, through their means, many scenes of confusion and distress have been prevented. Mine 
they accordingly have, and always shall have, for their opposition to any act of oppression ; and that act could 
be looked upon in no other light by every person, who would view it in its proper colors. 
</p><p>
I could wish it were in my power to congratulate 
you on the success of having the commercial system of 
these colonies put upon a more enlarged and extensive 
footing, than it is ; because I am well satisfied, that it 
would ultimately redound to the advantage of the mother 
country, so long as the colonies pursue trade and agriculture, and would be an effectual let to manufacturing 
among them. The money, which they raise, would 
centre in Great Britain, as certainly as the needle will 
settle to the pole. I am, &c.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 21 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1767">1767</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From a sudden hint of your brother's, I wrote to you 
a few days ago in a hurry. Having since had more 
time for reflection, I now write deliberately, and with 
greater precision, on the subject of my last letter. 
</p><p>
I then desired the favor of you (as I understood rights 
might now be had for the lands, which have fallen within 
the Pennsylvania line,) to look me out a tract of about 
fifteen hundred, two thousand, or more acres somewhere in your neighbourhood, meaning only by this, 
that it may be as contiguous to your own settlement, as 
such a body of good land can be found. It will be easy 
for you to conceive, that ordinary or even middling 
lands would never answer my purpose or expectation, 
so far from navigation, and under such a load of expenses, as these lands are encumbered with. No; a 
tract to please me must be rich, of which no person can 
be a better judge than yourself, and, if possible, level. 
Could such a piece of land be found, you would do me 
a singular favor in falling upon some method of securing 
it immediately from the attempts of others, as nothing is 
more certain, than that the lands cannot remain long ungranted, when once it is known, that rights are to be had. 
</p><p>
The mode of proceeding I am at a loss to point out 
to you ; but, as your own lands are under the same circumstances, self-interest will naturally lead you to an 
inquiry. I am told, that the land or surveyor's office is 
kept at Carlisle. If so, I am of opinion that Colonel 
Armstrong, an acquaintance of mine, has something to 
do in the direction of it, and I am persuaded he would 
readily serve me. I will write to him by the first opportunity on that subject, that the way may be prepared 
for your application to him, if you find it necessary. 
For your trouble and expense you may depend on being repaid. It is possible, but I do not know that it 
really is the case, that the custom in Pennsylvania will 
not admit so large a quantity of land, as I require, to be 
entered together; if so, this may perhaps be arranged 
by making several entries to the same amount, if the 
expense of doing it is not too heavy. This I only drop 
as a hint, leaving the whole to your discretion and good 
management. If the land can only be secured from 
others, it is all I want at present. The surveying I 
would choose to postpone, at least till the spring, when, 
if you can give me any satisfactory account of this matter, and of what I am next going to propose, I expect to 
pay you a visit about the last of April. 
</p><p>
I offered in my last to join you, in attempting to secure some of the most valuable lands in the King's part, 
which I think may be accomplished after a while, notwithstanding the proclamation, that restrains it at present, and prohibits the settling of them at all ; for I can 
never look upon that proclamation in any other light 
(but this I say between ourselves), than as a temporary 
expedient to quiet the minds of the Indians. It must 
fall, of course, in a few years, especially when those Indians consent to our occupying the lands. Any person, 
therefore, who neglects the present opportunity of hunting out good lands, and in some measure marking and 
distinguishing them for his own, in order to keep others 
from settling them, will never regain it. If you will be 
at the trouble of seeking out the lands, I will take upon 
me the part of securing them, as soon as there is a possibility of doing it, and will moreover be at all the cost 
and charges of surveying and patenting the same. You 
shall then have such a reasonable proportion of the 
whole, as we may fix upon at our first meeting ; as I 
shall find it necessary, for the better furthering of the 
design, to let some of my friends be concerned in the 
scheme, who must also partake of the advantages. 
</p><p>
By this time it may be easy for you to discover, that 
my plan is to secure a good deal of land. You will consequently come in for a very handsome quantity ; and as you will obtain it without any costs, or expenses, I hope 
you will be encouraged to begin the search in time. I 
would choose, if it were practicable, to get large tracts 
together ; and it might be desirable to have them as near 
your settlement, or Fort Pitt, as they can be obtained 
of good quality, but not to neglect others at a greater 
distance, if fine bodies of it lie in one place. It may be 
worthy of your inquiry, to find out how the Maryland 
back line will run, and what is said about laying off 
Neale's grant. I will inquire particularly concerning the 
Ohio Company, that we may know what to apprehend 
from them. For my own part, I should have no objection to a grant of land upon the Ohio, a good way below 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, but would first willingly secure some valuable 
tracts nearer at hand. 
</p><p>
I recommend, that you keep this whole matter a secret, or trust it only to those, in whom you can confide, 
and who can assist you in bringing it to bear by their 
discoveries of land. This advice proceeds from several 
very good reasons, and, in the first place, because I 
might be censured for the opinion I have given in respect to the King's proclamation, and then, if the scheme 
I am now proposing to you were known, it might give 
the alarm to others, and, by putting them upon a plan 
of the same nature, before we could lay a proper foundation for success ourselves, set the different interests 
clashing, and, probably, in the end, overturn the whole. 
All this may be avoided by a silent management, and 
the operation carried on by you under the guise of hunting game, which you may, I presume, effectually do, at 
the same time you are in pursuit of land. When this is fully discovered, advise me of it, and if there appears 
but a possibility of succeeding at any time hence, I will 
have the lands immediately surveyed, to keep others 
off, and leave the rest to time and my own assiduity. 
</p><p>
If this letter should reach your hands before you set 
out, I should be glad to have your thoughts fully expressed on the plan here proposed, or as soon afterwards as convenient ; for I am desirous of knowing in 
due time how you approve of the scheme. I am, &c.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Having once or twice of late heard you speak highly 
of the New Jersey College, as if you had a desire of 
sending your son William there (who, I am told, is a 
youth fond of study and instruction, and disposed to a 
studious life, in following which he may not only promote his own happiness, but the future welfare of others), 
I should be glad, if you have no other objection to it 
than the expense, if you would send him to that college, 
as soon as convenient, and depend on me for twentyfive pounds a year for his support, so long as it may be 
necessary for the completion of his education. If I live 
to see the accomplishment of this term, the sum here 
stipulated shall be annually paid ; and if I die in the 
mean time, this letter shall be obligatory upon my heirs, 
or executors, to do it according to the true intent and 
meaning hereof. 
</p><p>
No other return is expected, or wished, for this offer, 
than that you will accept it with the same freedom and 
good will, with which it is made, and that you may not 
even consider it in the light of an obligation, or mention 
it as such ; for, be assured, that from me it will never 
be known. I am, &,c.

TO GEORGE MASON.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 5 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1769">1769</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Herewith you will receive a letter and sundry papers, f which were forwarded to me a day or two ago 
by Dr. Ross of Bladensburg. I transmit them with the 
greater pleasure, as my own desire of knowing your 
sentiments upon a matter of this importance exactly coincides with the Doctor's inclinations. 
</p><p>
At a time, when our lordly masters in Great Britain will 
be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of 
American freedom, it seems highly necessary that something should be done to avert the stroke, and maintain 
the liberty, which we have derived from our ancestors. 
But the manner of doing it, to answer the purpose effectually, is the point in question. 
</p><p>
That no man should scruple, or hesitate a moment, to 
use arms in defence of so valuable a blessing, is clearly 
my opinion. Yet arms, I would beg leave to add, 
should be the last resource, the dernier resort. We 
have already, it is said, proved the inefficacy of addresses to the throne, and remonstrances to Parliament. 
How far, then, their attention to our rights and privileges 
is to be awakened or alarmed, by starving their trade 
and manufactures, remains to be tried. ' 
</p><p>
The northern colonies, it appears, are endeavouring to adopt this scheme. In my opinion it is a good one, and 
must be attended with salutary effects, provided it can 
be carried pretty generally into execution. But to what 
extent it is practicable to do so, I will not take upon me 
to determine. That there will be a difficulty attending 
the execution of it every where, from clashing interests, 
and selfish, designing men, ever attentive to their own 
gain, and watchful of every turn, that can assist their lucrative views, cannot be denied; and in the tobacco 
colonies, where the trade is so diffused, and in a manner 
wholly conducted by factors for their principals at home 
[in England], these difficulties are certainly enhanced, 
but I think not insurmountably increased, if the gentlemen in their several counties will be at some. pains to 
explain matters to the people, and stimulate them to 
cordial agreements to purchase none but certain enumerated articles out of any of the stores after a definite 
period, and neither import nor purchase any themselves. 
This, if it should not effectually withdraw the factors 
from their importations, would at least make them extremely cautious in doing it, as the prohibited goods 
could be vended to none but the non-associators, or 
those who would pay no regard to their association ; 
both of whom ought to be stigmatized, and made the 
objects of public reproach. 
</p><p>
The more I consider a scheme of this sort, the more 
ardently I wish success to it, because I think there are 
private as well as public advantages to result from it, 
the former certain, however precarious the other may 
prove. In respect to the latter, I have always thought, 
that by virtue of the same power, which assumes the 
right of taxation, the Parliament may attempt at least to 
restrain our manufactures, especially those of a public 
nature, the same equity and justice prevailing in the one 
case as the other, it being no greater hardship to forbid 
my manufacturing, than it is to order me to buy goods 
loaded with duties, for the express purpose of raising a 
revenue. But as a measure of this sort would be an 
additional exertion of arbitrary power, we cannot be 
placed in a worse condition, I think, by putting it to the 
test. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, that the colonies are considerably 
indebted to Great Britain, is a truth universally acknowledged. That many families are reduced almost, 
if not quite, to penury and want by the low ebb of their 
fortunes, and that estates are daily selling for the discharge of debts, the public papers furnish too many 
melancholy proofs. That a scheme of this sort will 
contribute more effectually than any other that can be 
devised to extricate the country from the distress it at 
present labors under, I most firmly believe, if it can be 
generally adopted. And I can see but one class of 
people, the merchants excepted, w r ho will not, or ought 
not, to wish well to the scheme, namely, they who live 
genteelly and hospitably on clear estates. Such as these, 
were they not to consider the valuable object in view, 
and the good of others, might think it hard to be curtailed in their living and enjoyments. As to the penurious man, he would thereby save his money and his 
credit, having the best plea for doing that, which before, 
perhaps, he had the most violent struggles to refrain 
from doing. The extravagant and expensive man has 
the same good plea to retrench his expenses. He 
would be furnished with a pretext to live within bounds, 
and embrace it. Prudence dictated economy before, 
but his resolution was too weak to put it in practice ; 
" For how can I," says he, " who have lived in such and 
such a manner, change my method ? I am ashamed to 
do it, and, besides, such an alteration .in the system of 
my living will create suspicions of the decay of my fortune, and such a thought the world must not harbour." 
He continues his course, till at last his estate comes to 
an end, a sale of it being the consequence of his perseverance in error. This I am satisfied is the way, 
that many, who have set out in the wrong track, have 
reasoned, till ruin has stared them in the face. And in 
respect to the needy man, he is only left in the same 
situation that he was found in, better, I may say, because, as he judges from comparison, his condition is 
amended in proportion as it approaches nearer to those 
above him. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, therefore, I think the scheme a good 
one, and that it ought to be tried here, with such alterations as our circumstances render absolutely necessary. 
But in what manner to begin the work, is a matter 
worthy of consideration. Whether it can be attempted 
with propriety or efficacy, further than a communication 
of sentiments to one another, before May, when the 
Court and Assembly will meet at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and a 
uniform plan can be concerted, and sent into the different counties to operate at the same time and in the 
same manner everywhere, is a thing upon which I am 
somewhat in doubt, and I should be glad to know your 
opinion. I am, &c.

TO LORD BOTETOURT, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 15 April, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1770">1770</a>. 
</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
Being fully persuaded of your Excellency's inclination to render every just and reasonable service to the 
people you govern, or to any body or society of them, 
that shall ask it, and being encouraged in a more particu
when set in competition with our liberty, ought to be rejected, not with 
reluctance, but with pleasure. Yet it is plain, that in the tobacco colonies 
we cannot at present confine our importations within such narrow bounds, 
as the northern colonies. A plan of this kind, to be practicable, must be 
adapted to our circumstances ; for if not steadily executed, it had better 
have remained unattempted. We may retrench all manner of superfluities, 
finery of all descriptions, and confine ourselves to linens, woollens, &c. 
not exceeding a certain price. It is amazing how much this practice, if 
adopted in all the colonies, would lessen the American imports, and distress the various traders and manufacturers in Great Britain. 
</p><p>
" This would awaken their attention. They would see, they would feel, 
the oppressions we groan under, and exert themselves to procure us redress. This once obtained, we should no longer discontinue our importations, confining ourselves still not to import any article, that should hereafter be taxed by act of Parliament for raising a revenue in America ; for, 
however singular I may be in my opinion, I am thoroughly convinced, that, 
justice and harmony happily restored, it is not the interest of these colonies 
to refuse British manufactures. Our supplying our mother country with 
gross materials, and taking her manufactures in return, is the true chain 
of connexion between us. These are the bands, which, if not broken by 
oppression, must long hold us together, by maintaining a constant reciprocation of interest. Proper caution should, therefore, be used in drawing 
up the proposed plan of association. It may not be amiss to let the ministry understand, that, until we obtain a redress of grievances, we will withhold from them our commodities, and particularly refrain from making tobacco, by which the revenue would lose fifty times more than all their oppressions could raise here. 
</p><p>
" Had the hint, which I have given with regard to taxation of goods imported into America, been thought of by our merchants before the repeal 
of the Stamp Act, the late American revenue acts would probably never 
have been attempted." 
</p><p>
The Assembly in May was the first that met after the arrival of Lord 
Botetourt as Governor. The Burgesses had been together but a few days, 
when they passed a series of very strong resolves respecting the rights 
</p><p>

</p><p>
356 WASHINGTON'S WRITINGS. [JET. 38. 
</p><p>
lar manner by a letter, which I have just received from 
Mr. Blair, clerk of the Council, to believe, that your 
Lordship is desirous of being fully informed how far the 
grant of land solicited by Mr. Walpole and others will 
affect the interest of this country in general, or individuals in particular, I shall take the liberty (as I am pretty 
intimately acquainted with the situation of the frontiers 
of this dominion) to inform your Lordship, that the 
bounds of that grant, if obtained upon the extensive plan 
</p><p>
of the colonies. The Governor took the alarm, and immediately dissolved 
the Assembly. As soon as the Burgesses left the public hall, they all met 
again at a private house in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> (May 18th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1769">1769</a>), appointed a 
moderator, and assented unanimously to a non-importation agreement, 
otherwise called an Association, consisting of a preamble and eight resolves. It was signed by every member present, and sent throughout the 
country for the signatures of the people. Washington was a member of 
the Assembly at that time. 
</p><p>
The Association is printed at large in Burk's History of Virginia, Vol. 
III. p. 345. On comparing it with Mr. Mason's manuscript draft, retained by 
Washington, I find it precisely the same, except the addition of two short 
articles, and the omission of another. The following article, contained in 
Mr. Mason's draft, was left out by the Burgesses. 
</p><p>
" If the measures already entered into should prove ineffectual, and our 
grievances and oppressions should notwithstanding be continued, then, 
and in that case, the subscribers will put a stop to their exports to Europe 
of tar, pitch, turpentine, timber, lumber, and skins and furs of all sorts, and 
will endeavour to find some other employment for their slaves and other 
hands than cultivating tobacco, which they will entirely leave off making, 
and will enter into such regulations, as may be necessary with regard to the 
rents and other tobacco debts." 
</p><p>
As Mr. Mason was not then a member of the House of Burgesses, and 
as Washington left home for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a> shortly after receiving the 
draft, he must have taken it with him to the Assembly, and of course have 
been a principal agent in procuring its adoption. 
</p><p>
He wrote afterwards as follows to his correspondent in London, on 
sending out his customary orders; "You will perceive, in looking over 
the several invoices, that some of the goods there required, are upon condition, that the act of Parliament imposing a duty on tea, paper, &c. for 
the purpose of raising a revenue in America, is totally repealed ; and I 
beg the favor of you to be governed strictly thereby, as it will not be in 
my power to receive any articles contrary to our non-importation agreement, which I have subscribed, and shall religiously adhere to, and should, 
if it were, as I could wish it to be, ten times as strict."

proposed, will comprehend at least four fifths of the 
land, for the purchase and survey of which this government has lately voted two thousand five hundred pounds 
sterling. It must, therefore, destroy the well grounded 
hopes of those, (if no reservation is made in their favor,) 
who have had the strongest assurances, that the government could give, of enjoying a certain portion of the 
lands, which have cost this country so much blood and 
treasure to secure. 
</p><p>
By the extracts, which your Excellency did me the 
honor to enclose, I perceive, that the petitioners propose 
to begin opposite to the mouth of the Scioto River, 
which is at least seventy or seventy-five miles below the 
Great Kenhawa, and more than three hundred from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, and to extend from thence in a southwardly 
direction through the pass of the Ouasioto Mountain, 
which, by Evans's map, and the best accounts I have 
been able to get from persons, who have explored that 
country, will bring them near the latitude of North 
Carolina. Thence they proceed northeastwardly to the 
Kenhawa, at the junction of New River and Green 
Briar, upon both of which waters we have many settlers 
upon lands actually patented. From that point they go 
up the Green Briar to the head of its northeasterly 
branch, thence easterly to the Allegany Mountains, 
thence along these mountains to the line of Lord Fairfax, and thence with his line, and the lines of Maryland 
and Pennsylvania, till the west boundary of the latter 
intersects the Ohio, and finally down that river to the 
place of beginning.
</p><p>
These, my Lord, are the bounds of a grant prayed for, and which, if obtained, will give a fatal blow, in my 
humble opinion, to the interests of this country. But these are my sentiments as a member of the community 
at large. I now beg leave to offer myself to your Excellency's notice, in a more interested point of view, 
as an individual, 'and as a person, who considers himself in some degree the representative of the officers and 
soldiers, who claim a right to two hundred thousand 
acres of this very land, under a solemn act of government, adopted at a period very important and critical to 
his Majesty's affairs in this part of the world. I shall, therefore, rely on your Lordship's accustomed goodness 
and candor, w r hilst I add a few words in support of the equity of our pretensions, although, in truth, I have very 
little to say on this subject now, which I have not heretofore taken the liberty of observing to your Excellency. 
The first letter I ever did myself the honor of writing 
to you, on the subject of this land, and to which I beg 
leave to refer, contained a kind of historical account of 
our claim ; but as there requires nothing more to elucidate a right, than to offer a candid exhibition of the 
case, supported by facts, I shall beg leave to refer your 
Lordship to an order of Council, of the 18th of February, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, and to Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, which 
issued in consequence of that order, both of which are 
enclosed. I will next add, that these troops not only 
enlisted agreeably to the proclamation, but behaved so 
much to the satisfaction of the country, as to be honored 
with the most public acknowledgments of it by the Assembly. Would it not be hard, then, my Lord, to deprive men under these circumstances, or their representatives, of the just reward of their toils ? Was not this 
act of the Governor and Council offered to the soldiers, 
and accepted by them, as an absolute compact ? And 
though the exigency of affairs, or the policy of government, made it necessary to continue these lands in a 
dormant state for some time, ought not their claim to be considered, in preference to all others ? When the 
causes cease, we fain would hope so. We flatter ourselves, that it will also appear to your Lordship in this 
point of view, and that, by your kind interposition, and 
favorable representation of the case, his Majesty will be 
graciously pleased to confirm this land to us, agreeably 
to a petition presented to your Excellency in Council on 
the 15th of last December; with this difference only, 
that, instead of Sandy Creek (one of the places allotted 
for the location of our grant, and which we now certainly know will not be comprehended within the ministerial 
line, as it is called), we may be allowed to lay a part of 
our grant between the west boundary of Pennsylvania 
and the river Ohio, which will be expressly agreeable to 
the words of Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation, inasmuch as it is contiguous to the Fork of the Monongahela. 
This favor, my Lord, would be conferring a singular obligation on soldiers, most of whom, either in their persons or fortunes, have suffered in the cause of their 
country ; and it cannot fail to receive the thanks of a 
grateful body of men, but of none more warmly than of 
your Lordship's most obedient and humble servant.

TO LORD DUNMORE, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.

</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
The very obliging offer your Lordship was pleased to 
make, the day I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, in behalf of the 
officers and soldiers, who, under the faith of government, lay claim to two hundred thousand acres of land, 
on the waters of the Ohio, promised them by proclamamation in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, I did not embrace, because it is evident 
to me, who am in some degree acquainted with the 
situation of that country, and the rapid progress now 
making in the settlement of it, that delay at this time in 
the prosecution of our plan would amount to the loss of 
the land, inasmuch as emigrants are daily and hourly 
settling on the choice spots, and waiting a favorable 
opportunity to solicit legal titles, on the ground of preoccupancy, when the office shall be opened. I therefore 
hoped, and the officers and soldiers, who have suffered 
in the cause of their country, still hope, that, although 
your Lordship was of opinion you could not at that time 
vest them with an absolute and bond fide grant of the 
land, yet that you will permit them to take such steps, 
at their own expense and risk, as others do, to secure 
their lands agreeably to proclamation, especially as their 
claim is prior to any other, and better founded, they 
having a solemn act of government and the general 
voice of the country in their favor. 
</p><p>
This is the light, my Lord, in which the matter appeared to me, and in this light it is also considered by 
the officers with whom I have lately had a meeting. 
The report gains ground, that a large tract of country 
on the Ohio, including every foot of land to the westward of the Allegany Mountains, is granted to a company of gentlemen in England, to be formed into a 
separate government. If this report is really well founded, there can be no doubt of your Lordship's having 
the earliest and most authentic accounts of it, since it 
so essentially interferes with the interests and expectations of this country. 
</p><p>
To request the favor of your Lordship to inform me 
whether this report be true, and, if true, whether any 
attention has been or probably will be paid to the order 
of Council and proclamation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1754">1754</a>, may be presumptuous ; but, as the officers and soldiers confide in me to 
transact this business for them, and as it would be a real 
advantage to them to know the truth of this report, and 
how it is likely to affect them, there needs no other 
apology for my taking the liberty of addressing to you 
this request, in the hope that your Lordship will condescend to do me the honor of writing a line on the subject by the next post to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, which will be 
acknowledged as a peculiar obligation conferred on, 
my Lord, your Lordship's most obedient servant.

TO THE REVEREND JONATHAN BOUCHER.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 9 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1771">1771</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
From several concurring causes, which exist at this 
moment, at the eve of my departure for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, 
I have both my head and hands too full of business to 
allow me time to write more than a hasty letter. This, 
however, I shall attempt to do, in answer to yours of the 
4th instant. 
</p><p>
In my last I informed you, that the friends (I do not 
by this confine myself to the relations only) of Mr. Custis were divided in opinion, as to the propriety of his 
travelling, not because they thought advantages would 
not result from it, but on account of the expense, as he 
would commence his tour with the heavy charge, which 
you thought requisite to induce you to accompany him, 
and which would at once anticipate half his income. 
His estate is of that kind, which rather comes under the 
denomination of a large than a profitable one. This divided opinion was a sufficient cause, I observed in my 
last, for me to be circumspect in my conduct, as I am 
accountable to another tribunal, besides that in my own 
breast, for the part I am to act on this occasion. You 
cannot but know, that every farthing, expended in behalf of this young gentleman, must undergo the inspection of the General Court, in their examination of my 
guardianship accounts, and that it would be imprudent 
in me to permit him to launch into any uncommon or 
extravagant course, especially at a time when a heavy 
and expensive chancery suit is instituted against his estate, without first knowing whether such a charge would 
be approved by those, who have a constitutional right to 
judge of the expediency or propriety of the measure. 
</p><p>
These are the reasons why I said in my last letter, 
that my own inclinations were still as strong as ever for 
Mr. Custis's pursuing his travelling scheme, provided 
the Court should approve of the expense, and provided, 
also, that it should appear, when his judgment was a 
little more matured, that he was desirous of undertaking 
this tour upon a plan of improvement, rather than a 
vague desire of gratifying an idle curiosity, or spending 
his money. If his mother does not speak her own sentiments, rather than his, he is lukewarm in the scheme ; 
and I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that his education, from what I have understood of his improvement, 
however advanced it may be for a youth of his age, is 
by no means ripe enough for a travelling tour. Not 
that I think his becoming a mere scholar is a desirable 
education for a gentleman, but I conceive a knowledge 
of books is the basis upon which other knowledge is to 
be built, and in travelling he is to become acquainted 
with men and things rather than books. At present, 
however well versed he may be in the principles of the 
Latin language (which is not to be wondered at, as he began the study of it as soon as he could speak), he is 
unacquainted with several of the classical authors, that 
might be useful to him. He is ignorant of Greek, the 
advantages of learning which I do not pretend to judge 
of, and he knows nothing of French, which is absolutely 
necessary to him as a traveller. He has little or no acquaintance with arithmetic, and is totally ignorant of the 
mathematics, than which, at least so much of them as 
relates to surveying, nothing can be more essentially 
necessary to any man possessed of a large landed estate, the bounds of some part or other of which are 
always in controversy. 
</p><p>
Now, whether he has time between this and next 
spring to acquire a sufficient knowledge of these studies, 
or so much of them as is requisite, I leave you to judge ; 
as also whether a boy of seventeen years old, which will 
be his age next November, can have any just notions of 
the end and design of travelling. I have already given 
it as my opinion, that it would be precipitating this 
event, unless he were to go immediately to the university for a couple of years, in which case he could see 
nothing of America ; which might be a disadvantage to 
him, as it is to be expected that every man, who travels 
with a view of observing the laws and customs of other 
countries, should be able to give some description of the 
situation and government of his own. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, it is impossible for me at this time to 
give a more decisive answer, however strongly inclined 
I may be to put you upon a certainty in this affair, than 
I have done ; and I should think myself wanting in candor, if I concealed any circumstance from you, which 
leads me to fear, that there is a possibility, if not a probability, that the whole design may be totally defeated. 
Before I ever thought myself at liberty to encourage 
this plan, I judged it highly reasonable and necessary, that his mother should be consulted. I laid your first 
letter and proposals before her, and desired that she 
would reflect well, before she resolved, as an unsteady 
behaviour might be a disadvantage to you. Her determination was, that, if it appeared to be his inclination to 
undertake this tour, and it should be judged for his benefit, she would not oppose it, whatever pangs it might 
give her to part with him. To this declaration she still 
adheres, but in so faint a manner, that I think, with her 
fears and his indifference, it will soon be declared he 
has no inclination to go. I do not say that this will be 
the case. I cannot speak positively ; but as this is the 
result of my own reflections upon the matter, I thought it but fair to communicate it to you. 
</p><p>
Several causes, I believe, have concurred to make 
her view his departure, as the time approaches, with 
more reluctance than she expected. The unhappy situation of her daughter has in some degree fixed her 
eyes upon him as her only hope. To what I have already said, I can only add, that my warmest wishes are 
to see him prosecute a plan, at a proper period, which I 
may be sure will redound to his advantage, and that 
nothing shall be wanting on my part to aid and assist 
him. In the event of his going, I should think myself 
highly favored, and him much honored, by Governor 
Eden's letters of introduction. Such letters, with others 
that might be procured, could not fail of having their 
advantages. 
</p><p>
You will please to make my compliments to Mr. Dulany, and assure him, that I have not the vestige of a 
house at the Frederic Springs, otherwise it should have 
been, if unengaged, much at his service. The two seasons I spent there I occupied a house of Mr. Mercer's.

I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since you first left this country, I have been favored 
with two letters from you ; one of them serving to enter 
your own, and the claims of Captains Stobo and Vanbraam, to part of the two hundred thousand acres of 
land, granted under Governor Dinwiddie's proclamation ; and the other, of the 18th of December, which did 
not come to my hands till about the first of last month, 
urging the expediency of prosecuting our right to those lands with spirit. 
</p><p>
In respect to the first, I have only to inform you, that 
your own claim, as well that for your brother as yourself, 
was entered before the receipt of your letter, and that 
Stobo's and Vanbraam's are also entered. In answer 
to the second, I can only add, that the same backwardness, which has ever appeared in our Honorable Board 
to recognise our right to these lands, seems still to prevail, and that our business in this affair is by no means 
in that forwardness, which I could wish, owing, I believe 
I may say, to other causes, as well as to a lukewarmness 
in those from whom we seek redress. The unequal 
interest and dispersed situation of the claimants make a 
regular cooperation difficult. An undertaking of this 
kind cannot be conducted without a good deal of expense and trouble ; and the doubt of obtaining the lands, 
after the utmost efforts, is such, as to discourage the 
larger part of the claimants from lending assistance, 
whilst a few are obliged to wade through every difficulty, or relinquish every hope. 
</p><p>
In this state of things, and in behalf of those, who had 
contributed to the expense of exploring and surveying 
the lands, I petitioned the Governor and Council, that the amount of each man's share, according to his rank, 
should be ascertained, and each claimant suffered to designate and survey his portion separately, by which means 
every man would stand upon his own footing. This 
petition I thought so reasonable, and so consistent with 
every principle of common justice, to say nothing of the 
disadvantage of being forced into large tracts, and the 
manifest inconvenience of dividing them afterwards, that 
I conceived it could not possibly be rejected ; but to my 
great astonishment it was so, and we are now compelled 
to be at the expense of surveying our whole quantity in 
twenty surveys, and then each individual subjected to 
the charge of surveying his own separately. In this 
way we are doubly taxed, while the whole is held as a 
kind of joint interest, and no man knows his property, 
or can tell how or in what manner to dispose of it. In 
short, so many glaring obstacles opposed their mode of 
proceeding, that they did not even attempt to remove 
them, but contented themselves with putting the soldiers upon a worse footing, than the meanest individual 
in the community, rather than be thought to give a license for the pillaging of his Majesty's or the Proprietary lands, when it is a fact well known, and every age 
evinces it, that no country ever was or ever will be 
settled without some indulgence. What inducements 
have men to explore uninhabited wilds, but the prospect 
of getting good lands ? Would any man waste his time, 
expose his fortune, nay, life, in such a search, if he was 
to share the good' and the bad with those that come 
after him 1 Surely not. We have surveyed ten of the 
largest tracts we can find in the district allowed us, and 
have been able to get sixty thousand acres, and for this 
tract we have been obliged to go between two and 
three hundred miles below Fort Pitt, as the lands thereabouts are thought to be within the Pennsylvania government ; at least, they are surveyed under those rights, 
and held by such a number of individuals, that it was thought to be impolitic to engage in private disputes, 
whilst there appeared a gloomy prospect of getting any land at all. 
</p><p>
The claims, which have been presented to me, are 
now all given in, and the Governor and Council have 
determined, that each officer shall share according to the 
rank in which he entered the service, and that the land 
shall be distributed in the following manner, namely, 
to each field-officer fifteen thousand acres, to each 
captain nine thousand, to each subaltern six thousand, to 
the cadets two thousand five hundred each, six hundred 
to a sergeant, five hundred to a corporal, and four hundred to each private soldier. They have made a reserve of thirty thousand acres, as well to provide for any 
claims, which may hereafter come in, as to compensate 
those, who have been and must necessarily continue to 
be saddled with the expense, which we find will not be 
very inconsiderable, as we have already expended near 
two hundred pounds, and the surveyor not yet paid.

TO WILLIAM EDWARDS, GOVERNOR OF WEST FLORIDA.

Virginia, 25 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1773">1773</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Wood, the bearer of this, is a gentleman of Virginia, going upon a tour to Florida. He proposes, 
before his return, to explore some of the ungranted 
lands in your government ; and, as I have never yet 
been able to designate the lands to which I am em titled 
under his Majesty's proclamation of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>, 
he has promised, if he meets with such lands as he 
thinks will answer my purpose, to have ten thousand 
acres surveyed for me. To five thousand acres I am 
entitled in my own right, by virtue of that proclamation j 
to the residue by purchase, certificates of which will be 
presented to your Excellency by Mr. Wood, under the 
hand and seal of Lord Dunmore, our present governor, i 
</p><p>
 See APPENDIX, No. VI. 
</p><p>
f By this proclamation, three new colonies were established in Amieri 
ca, namely, Quebec, or Canada, East Florida, and West Florida. Lands 
were also granted to the officers and soldiers, who had served in the late 
war, and who resided in America, on their personal application for the 
same, in the following quantities and proportions. To every field-officer five 
thousand acres, to every captain three thousand, to every subaltern or staffofiiccr two thousand, to every non-commissioned officer two liiuidr&d, and

</p><p>
My entire ignorance of the climate and soil, the advantages and disadvantages, of the country of West 
Florida, is the reason why his Lordship's certificates are 
couched in such general terms ; and of my giving Mr. 
Wood a discretionary power to select the lands, or not, 
as he may be influenced by these appearances. Should 
he meet with a spot favorable to my wishes, I have no 
doubt of your Excellency's granting the land, with such 
indulgences as have been practised in similar cases, 
agreeably to his Majesty's gracious intention, with the 
terms of which I shall endeavour strictly to comply. 
</p><p>
Could I, Sir, a stranger, take it upon me with propriety to recommend Mr. Wood, I should briefly add, 
that he is a gentleman well esteemed in Virginia, and I 
am persuaded will duly appreciate any little civilities 
you may be pleased to bestow on him. I have the 
honor to be, Sir, with very great respect, &,c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now set dow r n to write to you on a subject of 
importance, and of no small embarrassment to me. My 
son-in-law and ward, Mr. Custis, has, as I have been 
informed, paid his addresses to your second daughter, 
and, having made some progress in her affections, has 
solicited her in marriage. How far a union of this sort 
may be agreeable to you, you best can tell ; but I should 
think myself wanting in candor, were I not to confess, 
that Miss Nelly's amiable qualities are acknowledg
to every private fifty, and all to be free of quitrents for ten years. The 
lands could be chosen, however, only in one of the above three new colonies. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
PART!.] PRIVATE LETTERS. 371 
</p><p>
ed on all hands, and that an alliance with your family 
will be pleasing to his. 
</p><p>
This acknowledgment being made, you must permit me 
to add, Sir, that at this, or in any short time, his youth, 
inexperience, and unripened education, are, and will be, 
insuperable obstacles, in my opinion, to the completion of 
the marriage. As his guardian, I conceive it my indispensable duty to endeavour to carry him through a 
regular course of education (many branches of which, I 
am sorry to add, he is totally deficient in), and to guard 
his youth to a more advanced age before an event, on 
which his own peace and the happiness of another are 
to depend, takes place. Not that I have any doubt of 
the warmth of his affections, nor, I hope I may add, any 
fears of a change in them ; but at present I do not conceive that he is capable of bestowing that attention 
to the important consequences of the married state, which 
is necessary to be given by those, who are about to enter 
into it, and of course I am unwilling he should do it till 
he is. If the affection, which they have avowed for 
each other, is fixed upon a solid basis, it will receive no 
diminution in the course of two or three years, in which 
time he may prosecute his studies, and thereby render 
himself more deserving of the lady and useful to society. 
If, unfortunately, as they are both young, there should be 
an abatement of affection on either side, or both, it had 
better precede than follow marriage. 
</p><p>
Delivering my sentiments thus freely will not, I hope, 
lead you into a belief, that I am desirous of breaking off 
the match. To postpone it is all I have in view ; for I 
shall recommend to the young gentleman, with the 
warmth that becomes a man of honor, (notwithstanding 
he did not vouchsafe to consult either his mother or me 
on the occasion,) to consider himself as much engaged 
to your daughter, as if the indissoluble knot were tied ; and, as the surest means of effecting this, to apply 
himself closely to his studies, (and in this advice 
I flatter myself you will join me,) by which he will, 
in a great measure, avoid those little flirtations with 
other young ladies, that may, by dividing the attention, 
contribute not a little to divide the affection. 
</p><p>
It may be expected of me, perhaps, to say something 
of property ; but, to descend to particulars, at this time, 
must seem rather premature. In general, therefore, I 
shall inform you, that Mr. Custis's estate consists of 
about fifteen thousand acres of land, a good part of it 
adjoining the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=williamsburg" rel="city">Williamsburg</a>, and none of it 
forty miles from that place ; several lots in the said 
city ; between two and three hundred negroes ; and 
about eight or ten thousand pounds upon bond, and in 
the hands of his merchants. This estate he now holds 
independent of his mother's dower, which will be an 
addition to it at her death ; and, upon the whole, it ^s 
such an estate as you will readily acknowledge ought to 
entitle him to a handsome portion with a wife. But as 
I should never require a child of my own to make a 
sacrifice of himself to interest, so neither do I think it 
incumbent on me to recommend it as a guardian. 
</p><p>
At all times when you, Mrs. Calvert, or the young 
ladies, can make it convenient to favor us with a visit, 
we should be. happy in seeing you at this place. Mrs. Washington and Miss Custis join me in respectful compliments, and 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

MY LORD, 
</p><p>
In obedience to your Lordship's request, I do myself 
the honor to inform you, that, by letters this day received from Dr. Cooper of King's College in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I 
find it will be about the first of next month before I 
shall set off for that place, and that it will perhaps be 
the middle of June before I return. Harvest then coming on, and seldom ending till after the middle of July, 
I could almost wish to see it accomplished ; but if the 
delay in doing it is attended with any kind of inconvenience to your Lordship, I will, at all events, be ready by 
the first of July to accompany you through any and 
every part of the western country, which you may 
think proper to visit. 
</p><p>
I beg the favor of your Lordship to inform me, 
therefore, as nearly as you can, of the precise time you 
will do me the honor of calling here, that I may get 
ready accordingly, and give notice of it to Mr. Crawford (if your Lordship purposes to take the route of 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>), whom I took the liberty of recommending as 
a good woods-man, and well acquainted with the lands 
in that quarter, that he may be disengaged when we 
get to his house, which is directly on that communication. I am persuaded, that such a person will be found 
very necessary in an excursion of this sort, from his 
superior knowledge of the country, and of the inhabitants, who are thinly scattered over it. 
</p><p>
No person can be better acquainted with the equipage and simple conveniences necessary in an undertaking of this sort, than your Lordship, and, therefore, 
it would be impertinent in me to mention them ; but if 
your Lordship should find it convenient to have any thing provided in this part of the country, and will 
please to honor me with your commands, they shall be 
punctually obeyed. As, also, if your Lordship chooses 
to have an Indian engaged, I will write to Colonel 
Croghan, Deputy Indian Agent, who lives near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, to have one provided. 
</p><p>
The design of my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> is to take 
my son-in-law, Mr. Custis, to King's College. If your 
Lordship, therefore, has any letters or commands, either 
to that place or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I shall think myself honored in being the bearer of them, as well as benefited

REVEREND SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you have a set of bills for one hundred

answer Mr. Custis's expenses at college, and such calls 
as he may have for cash to defray the incident expenses 
of his abode in this city. 
</p><p>
In respect to the first article of charge, I submit the 
matter wholly to your better judgment, under a firm 
belief of your adopting such measures, as will most contribute to promote the principal end of Mr. Custis's 
coming here, not regarding the extra charge incurred in 
the accomplishment of it. In regard to the second, 
as I do not know what sum he ought, with propriety, to 
expend in such a place as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, I shall not undertake to determine it ; but hope, if, contrary to my expectation, you should find him inclined to run into any 
kind of extravagance, you will be so good, by your 
friendly admonition, as to check its progress. 
</p><p>
As Mr. Custis may probably want clothing and other 
necessaries, you will please to establish a credit in his 
behalf with such merchants as you can recommend ; and 
when the deposit now lodged with you is expended in 
this and other payments, be so good as to transmit me 
a copy of the disbursements, and I shall furnish you 
with other bills whereby to lay in a new fund. 
</p><p>
I have nothing further to add at present, except that 
at the next vacation, or at any other time, I shall think 
myself very happy in seeing you in Virginia, and that I 
am, with very great respect and esteem, your most obedient humble servant.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have heard, (the truth of which, if you saw Lord 
Dunmore in his way to or from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a> you possibly 
are better acquainted with than I am,) that his Lordship 
will grant patents for lands lying below the Scioto, to 
the officers and soldiers, who claim under the proclamation of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. If so, I think no time should be 
lost in having them surveyed, lest some new revolution 
should happen in our political system. I have, therefore, by this conveyance, written to Captain Bullitt, 
to desire he will have ten thousand acres surveyed for 
me ; five thousand of which I am entitled to in my own right, the other five thousand by purchase from a captain and lieutenant. 
</p><p>
I have desired him to get this quantity of land in one 
tract, if to be had of the first quality ; if not, then in two, 
or even in three, agreeably to the several rights under 
which I hold, rather than survey bad land for me, or 
even that which is middling. I have also desired him 
to get it as near the mouth of the Scioto, that is, to the 
western bounds of the new colony  as may be ; but for 
the sake of' better lands, I would go quite down to the 
Falls, or even below, meaning thereby to get richer 
and wider bottoms, as it is my desire to have my lands 
run out upon the banks of the Ohio. If you should go 
down the river this fall, in order to look out your own 
quantity under the proclamation, I shall be much obliged 
to you for your assistance to Captain Bullitt, in getting 
these ten thousand acres for me, of the most valuable 
land you can, and I will endeavour to make you ample 
amends for your trouble ; but I by no means wish or 
desire you to go down on my account, unless you find 
it expedient on your own. Of this I have written to 
Captain Bullitt, under cover to you, desiring, if you 
should be with him, that he will ask your assistance. 
</p><p>
As I have understood that Captain Thompson (by 
what authority I know not) has been surveying a good 
deal of land for the Pennsylvania officers, and that Dr. 
Connolly has a promise from our Governor of two thousand acres at the Falls, I have desired Captain Bullitt 
by no means to involve me in disputes with any person, 
who has an equal claim to land with myself, under the 
proclamation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. As to the pretensions of other 
people, it is not very essential ; as I am told that the 
Governor has declared he will grant patents to none but 
the officers and soldiers, who are comprehended within the proclamation aforementioned ; but even of these 
claims, if I could get lands equally as good, as convenient, and as valuable in every respect, elsewhere, I 
should choose to steer clear.

Old David Wilper, who was an officer in our regiment, and has been with Bullitt running out land for 
himself and others, tells me, that they have already discovered four salt springs in that country, three oi 
which Captain Thompson has included within some surveys he has made ; and the other, an exceedingly valuable one, upon the River Kentucky, is in some kind of dispute. I wish I could establish one of my surveys there ; 
I would immediately turn it to an extensive public benefit, as well as private advantage. However, as four are 
already discovered, it is more than probable there are 
many others, and if you could come at the knowledge 
of them by means of the Indians, or otherwise, I would 
join you in taking them up in the name or names of 
some persons, who have a right under the proclamation, 
and whose right we can be sure of buying, as it seems 
there is no other method of having lands granted ; 
but this should be done with a good deal of circumspection and caution, till patents are obtained. 
</p><p>
I did not choose to forego the opportunity of writing 
to you by the gentlemen, who are going to divide their 
land at the mouth of the great Kenhawa, though I could 
wish to have delayed it till I could hear from the Governor, to whom I have written, to know certainly whether he will grant patents for the land which Captain Bullitt is surveying, that one may proceed with safety ; as also whether a discretionary power, which I had given 
Mr. Wood to select my land in West Florida, under an 
information, even from his Lordship himself, that lands 
could not be had here, would be any bar to my surveying on the Ohio ; especially as I have heard since Mr. Wood's departure, that all the lands on that part of 
the Mississippi, to which he was restricted by me, are 
already engaged by the emigrants, who have resorted 
to that country. Should I, however, receive any discouraging account from his Lordship on these heads, I 
shall embrace the first opportunity that offers afterwards 
to acquaint you with it. 
</p><p>
By Mr. Leet I informed you of the unhappy cause, 
which prevented my going out this fall. But I hope 
nothing will prevent my seeing you in that country in 
the spring. The precise time, as yet, it is not in my 
power to fix ; but I should be glad if you would let me 
know how soon it may be attended with safety, ease, 
and comfort, after which I will fix upon a time to be at 
your house. 
</p><p>
I am in the mean while, with sincere good wishes for 
you, Mrs. Crawford, and family, your friend, &c.

</p><p>
MY LORD, 
</p><p>
Urged by repeated applications from a number of 
officers, whom I have had the honor to command in the service of this colony, I take the liberty of addressing 
your Excellency on the subject of the lands, which the gentlemen conceive themselves entitled to under his 
Majesty's bounty of October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1763">1763</a>. 
</p><p>
The exception in favor of the officers and soldiers, 
contained in his Majesty's order in Council, of the 6th 
of April last, they humbly conceive is so strong an implication of your Lordship's right to grant them these 
lands, as to remove every restraint you were under before ; and as there are no waste lands to be had in this 
colony, but such as lie upon the western waters, they 
humbly pray for leave to survey on the river Ohio, and 
its waters, below the mouth of Scioto (the western 
boundary of the new colony, should it ever take place), 
apprehending that your Excellency has an undoubted 
right to grant patents for these lands, since they have 
ever been considered as appertaining to Virginia, warranted, as they have been informed, by the Colony 
Charter, and sold by the Six Nations at the treaty of 
Fort Stanwix, in 1768. Nor is the right thereto, it is 
humbly presumed, by any means diminished by the 
nominal line, commonly called the Ministerial Line; 
since that transaction seems to have been considered by 
government as a temporary expedient, at the instigation 
of the Indian Agent, to satisfy the southern Indians, 
who, as it is said, have disclaimed any right to the very

I do not mean to grant any patents on the western waters, as I do not 
think I am at present empowered so to do. I did, indeed, tell a poor old 
German lieutenant, who was with me, and informed me he was very poor, 
and had ten children, that I might possibly grant him a patent contiguous 
to that, which he had under Mr. Dinwiddie's proclamation, which I suppose 
is what may have given rise to the report you have heard. As to Captain 
Bullitt, I know nothing about his surveying any lands, and did, when I was 
at Fort Pitt, write to him and advise him to return again immediately.

</p><p>
REVEREND SIR, 
</p><p>
The favorable account, which you were pleased to 
transmit to me, of Mr. Custis's conduct at college, gave 
me very great satisfaction. I hoped to have felt an increase of it by his continuance at that place, under a 
gentleman so capable of instructing him in every branch 
of useful knowledge. But this hope is at an end ; and 
it has been against my wishes, that he should quit college, in order that he may enter soon into a new scene 
of life, which I think he would be much fitter for some 
years hence, than now.  But having his own inclination, the desires of his mother, and the acquiescence of 
almost all his relatives to encounter, I did not care, as 
he is the last of the family, to push my opposition too 
far, and I have therefore submitted to a kind of necessity. 
</p><p>
Not knowing how his expenses at college may stand, 
I shall be much obliged to you if you will render me an 
account of them. You will please to charge liberally 
for your own particular attention to Mr. Custis, and 
sufficiently reward the other gentlemen, who were engaged in the same good offices. If the money I left 
with you is insufficient to answer these purposes, please 
to advise me thereof, and I will remit the deficiency. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry it was not in my power to see you 
whilst in these parts. I thank you very sincerely, Sir, 
for your polite regard to Mr. Custis, during his abode at 
college, and through you beg leave to offer my acknowledgments in like manner to the professors. With 
very great esteem and regard, Reverend Sir,

I am, your most obedient humble servant.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am going to give you a little trouble, because I am 
persuaded you will excuse it. No good reason, you 
will say ; but it 'is the best I can offer for such a liberty. 
</p><p>
Interested as well as political motives render it necessary for me to seat the lands, which I have patented on 
the Ohio, in the cheapest, most expeditious, and effectual manner. Many expedients have been proposed to 
accomplish this, but none, in my judgment, so likely to 
succeed as the importing of Palatines. But how to do 
this upon the best terms, is a question I wish to have 
answered. Few of this kind of people ever come to 
Virginia, whether because it is out of the common course 
of its trade, or because they object to it, I am unable to 
determine. I shall take it very kind in you, therefore, to 
resolve the following questions, which I am persuaded 
you can do with precision, by inquiring of such gentlemen, as have been engaged in this business. 
</p><p>
Whether there is any difficulty in procuring these 
people in Holland? If so, from whence does it proceed 1 Whether they are to be had at all times, or at 
particular seasons only, and when 1 Whether they are 
engaged previously to sending for them, and in what 
manner ? Or do ships take their chance after getting 
there ? Upon what terms are they generally engaged ? 
And how much for each person do they commonly 
stand the importer landed at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. ? Is it custernary to send an intelligent German in the ship, that 
is to bring them ? Do vessels ever go immediately to 
Holland for them, and, if they do, what cargoes do they 
carry? Or are they to go round, and where? In 
short, what plan would be recommended to me, by the 
knowing ones, as best for importing a full freight, say 
two or three hundred or more, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> ? In case 
of full freight, how are the numbers generally proportioned to the tonnage of a vessel ? 
</p><p>
Your favor in answering these several queries, with 
any other information, which you may think necessary 
for me to be possessed of, I shall gratefully receive, as I 
am totally unacquainted with every thing of the kind. 
</p><p>
I hope, though you have removed from this part of 
the world, that you do not mean to forsake us altogether, 
and that it is unnecessary to add, that I shall at all times 
be happy in seeing you at this place. My best respects 
attend your good father, sisters, and brothers ; and, with 
very sincere regard, I remain, dear Sir, &c.

TO HENRY RIDDELL. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 22 February, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Mr. Young, hearing me express a desire of importing 
Palatines to settle on my lands on the Ohio, tells me, 
that, in discoursing of this matter in your company, you 
suggested an expedient, which might probably be attended with success ; and that if I inclined to adopt it, 
you wished to be informed before the sailing of your 
ship. 
</p><p>
The desire of seating and improving my lands on the 
Ohio, is founded on interested as well as political views. 
But the intention of importing Palatines for the purpose was more the effect of sudden thought, than mature 
consideration, because I am totally unacquainted with 
the manner, as well as the expense of doing it ; and I 
was led into the notion principally from a report of either 
this or some other ship of yours being blamed, for riot 
taking an offered freight of these Germans at forty shillings sterling. I was thus induced to think if this charge 
was not much accumulated by other expenses, that I 
could fall on no better expedient to settle my lands with 
industrious people, than by such an importation. 
</p><p>
The terms upon which I have thought of importing 
Palatines, or people from Ireland, or Scotland, are these ; 
to import them at my expense, where they are unable to transport themselves, into the Potomac River, 
and from hence to the Ohio ; to have them, in the first 
case, engaged to me under indenture ; in the second, by 
some other contract equally valid, to become tenants 
upon the terms hereafter mentioned ; as without these 
securities, I would not encounter the expense, trouble, 
and hazard of such an importation. 
</p><p>
But to make matters as easy and agreeable as possible to these emigrants, I will engage, on my part, that 
the indentures shall be considered in no other light, than 
as a security for reimbursing to me every expense I am 
under, with interest, in importing them, removing them 
to the land, and supporting them there, till they can raise 
a crop for their own subsistence ; giving up the said 
indentures, and considering them altogether as freemen 
and tenants, so soon as this shall happen ; not to each 
person or family respectively, but when the whole accumulated expense shall be discharged ; as I must, for my 
own safety, consider them as jointly bound for this payment, till the expiration of the indented terms, otherwise 
T must be an inevitable loser by every death or other 
accident ; whilst they cannot, in the worst light, be considered as more than servants at large during the indented term. I can also engage to set them down upon 
as good land as any in that country ; and, where there 
is neither house built, nor land cleared, I will allow them 
an exemption of rent four years ; and, where there is a 
house erected, and five acres of land cleared and fit for 
cultivation, two years. 
</p><p>
They shall have the land upon lease for twenty-one 
years, under the usual covenants ; and also at an annual 
rent, after the first becomes due, of four pounds sterling for each hundred acres, allowing each family to take 
more or less, as inclination and convenience may prompt. 
And I will, moreover, engage to renew the leases at the 
expiration of the above tw r enty-one years ; and, in like 
manner, at the end of every seven years afterwards, upon 
an increased rent, to be agreed on between the landlord 
and tenant ; or, in order to fix the matter absolutely, if 
this should be more agreeable, the rent may be increased 
at these periods in proportion to the increased value of 
that, or the adjoining lands possessed of equal advantages of soil and situation. 
</p><p>
These are the terms on which I thought to import 
and plant people on my Ohio lands, which are, for the 
quantity, equal if not superior to any in that country ; 
situate altogether upon the Ohio, or Great Kenhawa, 
two fine inland navigable rivers, abounding in fish and 
wild fowl of all sorts, as the lands do in wild meats of 
the best kind. 
</p><p>
From <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> to the navigable waters of the Ohio, 
along a much frequented road used by wagons, is, according to the computed distance, two hundred miles. 
This land -carriage, if the inland navigation of the Potomac should be effected, than which I think nothing easier, will be reduced to sixty miles as matters now 
stand ; some say to forty, and others to twenty. But, call it the greatest distance, any commodity made upon 
any part of these lands of mine may be transported 
along a very easy water-communication to the settlement of Red-stone, where the land-carriage at this time 
begins. To say nothing, therefore, of the advantages 
of raising stock of all kinds, and horses, which will carry 
themselves to market, and are now and will, from the 
nature of things, continue to be in great demand in the 
interior parts of this great continent, hemp, flax, potashes, indigo, and the like, will well afford the expense 
of this land-carriage, admitting it never may be reduced, 
and can be cultivated to advantage on the river bottoms 
in that country. 
</p><p>
Having thus exhibited a general view of my design, 
I shall now be obliged to you, Sir, to inform me with 
as much precision as you can, what certainty there is 
that your ship will go to Holland; what probability 
there is of her getting Palatines, if she does go ; when 
they may be expected in this country; what would 
be the freight; and, as near as you can judge, the 
whole incidental expense attending each person delivered at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a> ; and, moreover, whether it 
would be expected, that the whole of these charges, 
including freight, should be paid down immediately on 
the arrival of the ship here, as it must appear rather 
hard to make a certain provision for an uncertain event. 
It may not be amiss further to observe, that I see no 
prospect of these people being restrained in the smallest 
degree, either in their civil or religious principles ; which 
I take notice of, because these are privileges, which 
mankind are solicitous to enjoy, and upon which emigrants must be anxious to be informed. 
</p><p>
I wrote to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> by the last post for full information of the manner and charge of importing these 
people from Holland ; and, if your account in answer to this letter should prove agreeable to my wishes, I will 
send a more particular description of the lands, which I 
wish to settle, as well as copies of the plots, and do any 
other matter which may be judged necessary to further 
the design. I am, &,c.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Enclosed you will receive Mr. Hughes's warrant in 
his own right, for two thousand acres of land, the getting of which, at this time, he must look upon as a very 
great favor, as the Governor has dispensed with two 
positive instructions to oblige him. He would not grant 
a warrant for the other claims under Johnston. Hughes 
was very negligent in not sending the former certificates 
granted him.

I got a gentleman of my acquaintance in Maryland to 
mention his case to Governor Eden, who promised to 
have the matter inquired into, and do what he could for 
his relief. Why it has not been done, I cannot tell ; but 
if my contributing twenty or twenty -five pounds to his 
relief will procure his liberty, you may set me down for 
that sum, and I will pay it at any time when the subscription is full. But how he is to get over the other 
matter, of giving Maryland security for his good behaviour, I know not. You are best acquainted with the

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
John has just delivered to me your favor of yesterday, which I shall be obliged to answer in a more 
concise manner, than I could wish, as I am very much 
engaged in raising one of the additions to my house, 
which I think (perhaps it is fancy) goes on better whilst 
I am present, than in my absence from the workmen. 
</p><p>
I own to you, Sir, I wished much to hear of your 
making an open declaration of taking a poll for this 
county, upon Colonel West's publicly declining last 
Sunday ; and I should have written to you on the subject, but for information then received from several gentlemen in the churchyard, of your having refused to do 
so, for the reasons assigned in your letter;! upon which, 
as I think the country never stood more in need of men 
of abilities and liberal sentiments than now, I entreated 
several gentlemen at our church yesterday to press 
Colonel Mason to take a poll, as I really think Major 
Broad water, though a good man, might do as well in the 
discharge of his domestic concerns, as in the capacity of a legislator. And therefore I again express my wish, 
that nither you or Colonel Mason would offer. I can 
be of little assistance to either, because I early laid it 
dow r n as a maxim not to propose myself, and solicit for a 
second. 
</p><p>
As to your political sentiments, I would heartily join 
you in them, so far as relates to a humble and dutiful 
petition to the throne, provided there was the most distant hope of success. But have we not tried this 
already? Have we not addressed the Lords, and remonstrated to the Commons 1 And to what end 1 Did 
they deign to look at our petitions ? Does it not appear, 
as clear as the sun in its meridian brightness, that there 
is a regular, systematic plan formed to fix the right and 
practice of taxation upon us? Does not the uniform 
conduct of Parliament for some years past confirm this ? 
Do not all the debates, especially those just brought to 
us, in the House of Commons on the side of government, 
expressly declare that America must be taxed in aid of 
the British funds, and that she has no longer resources 
within herself? Is there any thing to be expected from 
petitioning after this ? Is not the attack upon the liberty 
and property of the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, before restitution 
of the loss to the India Company was demanded, a plain 
and self-evident proof of what they are aiming at ? Do 
not the subsequent bills (now I dare say acts), for depriving the Massachusetts Bay of its charter, and for 
transporting offenders into other colonies or to Great 
Britain for trial, where it is impossible from the nature 
of the thing that justice can be obtained, convince us 
that the administration is determined to stick at nothing 
to carry its point? Ought we not, then, to put our virtue and fortitude to the severest test ? 
</p><p>
With you I think it a folly to attempt more than we 
can execute, as that will not only bring disgrace upon us, but weaken our cause ; yet I think we may do more 
than is generally believed, in respect to the non-importation scheme. As to the withholding of our remittances, 
that is another point, in which I own I have my doubts 
on several accounts, but principally on that of justice ; 
for I think, whilst we are accusing others of injustice, 
we should be just ourselves ; and how this can be, whilst 
we owe a considerable debt, and refuse payment of it to 
Great Britain, is to me inconceivable. Nothing but the 
last extremity, I think, can justify it. Whether this is 
now come, is the question. 
</p><p>
I began with telling you, that I was to write a short 
letter. My paper informs me I have done otherwise. 
I shall hope to see you to-morrow, at the meeting of the 
county in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=alexandria" rel="city">Alexandria</a>, when these points are to be considered. I am, dear Sir, your most obedient and humble servant.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 20 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 17th was not presented to me till 
after the resolutions, which were judged advisable for 
this county to adopt, had been revised, altered, and corrected in the committee ; nor till we had gone into a 
general meeting in the court-house, and my attention 
was necessarily called every moment to the business 
before us. I did, however, upon the receipt of it, in 
that hurry and bustle, hastily run it over, and I handed 
it round to the gentlemen on the bench, of whom there 
were many ; but, as no person present seemed in the 
least disposed to adopt your sentiments, as there appeared a perfect satisfaction and acquiescence in the 
measures proposed (except from Mr. Williamson, who 
was for adopting your advice literally, without obtaining 
a second voice on his side), and as the gentlemen, to 
whom the letter was shown, advised me not to have it 
read, as it was not likely to make a convert, and was 
repugnant, some of them thought, to every principle we 
were contending for, I forbore to offer it otherwise 
than in the manner abovementioned ; which I shall be 
sorry for, if it gives you any dissatisfaction that your 
sentiments were not read to the county at large, instead 
of being communicated to the first people in it, by offering them the letter in the manner I did. 
</p><p>
That I differ very widely from you, in respect to the mode of obtaining a repeal of the acts so much and so 
justly complained of, I shall not hesitate to acknowledge ; and that this difference in opinion probably proceeds 
from the different constructions we put upon the conduct and intention of the ministry may also be true ; but, 
as I see nothing, on the one hand, to induce a belief, that the Parliament would embrace a favorable opportunity of repealing acts, which they go on with great 
rapidity to pass, in order to enforce their tyrannical system ; and, on the other, I observe, or think I observe, 
that government is pursuing a regular plan at the expense of law and justice to overthrow our constitutional 
rights and liberties, how can I expect any redress from 
a measure, which has been ineffectually tried already ? 
For, Sir, what is it we are contending against? Is it 
against paying the duty of three pence per pound on 
tea because burthensome ? No, it is the right only, that 
we have all along disputed ; and to this end we have already petitioned his Majesty in as humble and dutiful a 
manner, as subjects could do. Nay, more, we applied 
to the House of Lords and House of Commons in their 
different legislative capacities, setting forth, that, as 
Englishmen, we could not be deprived of this essential 
and valuable part of our constitution. If, then, as the 
fact really is, it is against the right of taxation that we 
now do, and, as I before said, all along have contended, 
why should they suppose an exertion of this power 
would be less obnoxious now than formerly? And 
what reason have we to believe, that they would make 
a second attempt, whilst the same sentiments fill the breast of every American, if they did not intend to enforce it if possible ?
</p><p>
The conduct of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people could not justify 
the rigor of their measures, unless there had been a 
requisition of payment and refusal of it ; nor did that 
conduct require an act to deprive the government of 
Massachusetts Bay of their charter, or to exempt offenders from trial in the places where offences were committed, as there was not, nor could there be, a single 
instance produced to manifest the necessity of it. Are 
not all these things evident proofs of a fixed and uniform plan to tax us? If we want further proofs, do 
not all the debates in the House of Commons serve to 
confirm this? And has not General Gage's conduct 
since his arrival, in stopping the address of his Council, 
and publishing a proclamation more becoming a Turkish 
bashaw, than an English governor, declaring it treason 
to associate in any manner by which the commerce of 
Great Britain is to be affected, has not this exhibited an 
unexampled testimony of the most despotic system of tyranny, that ever was practised in a free government? 
In short, what further proofs are wanting to satisfy any 
one of the designs of the ministry, than their own acts, 
which are uniform and plainly tending to the same point, 
nay, if I mistake not, avowedly to fix the right of taxation ? What hope have we then from petitioning, when 
they tell us, that now or never is the time to fix the 
matter? Shall we, after this, whine and cry for relief, 
when we have already tried it in vain ? Or shall we 
supinely sit and see one province after another fall a 
sacrifice to despotism? 
</p><p>
If I were in any doubt, as to the right which the Parliament of Great Britain had to tax us without our consent, I should most heartily coincide with you in opinion, 
that to petition, and petition only, is the proper method 
to apply for relief; because we should then be asking a 
favor, and not claiming a right, which, by the law of 
nature and by our constitution, we are, in my opinion, 
indubitably entitled to. I should even think it criminal 
to go further than this, under such an idea ; but I have 
none such. I think the Parliament of Great Britain have 
no more right to put their hands into my pocket, without 
my consent, than I have to put my hands into yours ; 
and this being already urged to them in a firm, but decent manner, by all the colonies, what reason is there 
to expect any thing from their justice ? 
</p><p>
As to the resolution for addressing the throne, I own 
to you, Sir, I think the whole might as well have been 
expunged. I expect nothing from the measure, nor 
should my voice have sanctioned it, if the non-importation scheme was intended to be retarded by it ; for I am convinced, as much as I am of my existence, that 
there is no relief for us but in their distress ; and I think, 
at least I hope, that there is public virtue enough left 
among us to deny ourselves every thing but the bare 
necessaries of life to accomplish this end. This we have 
a right to do, and no power upon earth can compel us 
to do otherwise, till it has first reduced us to the most 
abject state of slavery. The stopping of our exports 
would, no doubt, be a shorter method than the other to 
effect this purpose; but if we owe money to Great 
Britain, nothing but the last necessity can justify the 
non-payment of it ; and, therefore, I have great doubts 
upon this head, and wish to see the other method first 
tried, which is legal and will facilitate these payments. 
</p><p>
I cannot conclude without expressing some concern, 
that I should differ so widely in sentiments from you, on 
a matter of such great moment and general import ; and 
I should much distrust my own judgment upon the occasion, if my nature did not recoil at the thought of submitting to measures, which I think subversive of every 
thing that I ought to hold dear and valuable, and did I 
not find, at the same time, that the voice of mankind is 
with me. I must apologize for sending you so rough a sketch of my thoughts upon your letter. When I look 
back, and see the length of my own, I cannot, as I am a good deal hurried at this time, think of taking off a fair copy. 
</p><p>
I am, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a>, 24 August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 5th instant came to this place, forwarded by Mr. Ramsay, a few days after my return 
from William sbu rg, and I delayed acknowledging it sooner, in the hope that I should find time, before I 
began my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to answer it fully, 
if not satisfactorily ; but, as much of my time has been engrossed since I came home by company, by your 
brother's sale and the business consequent thereupon, in writing letters to England, and now in attending to 
my own domestic affairs previous to my departure, I find it impossible to bestow as much attention on the 
subject of your letter as I could wish, and, therefore, I must rely upon your good nature and candor in excuse 
for not attempting it. In truth, persuaded as I am, 
that you have read all the political pieces, which compose a large share of the gazettes at this time, I should 
think it, but for your request, a piece of inexcusable arrogance in me, to make the least essay towards a change 
in your political opinions ; for I am sure I have no new light to throw upon the subject, nor any other arguments to offer in support of my own doctrine, than what 
you have seen ; .and I could only in general add, that an innate spirit of freedom first told me, that the measures, 
which the administration have for some time been, and now are most violently pursuing, are opposed to every 
principle of natural justice; whilst much abler heads than my own have fully convinced me, that they are not 
only repugnant to natural right, but subversive of the laws and constitution of Great Britain itself, in the establishment of which some of the best blood in the kingdom has been spilt. 
</p><p>
Satisfied, then, that the acts of the British Parliament are no longer governed by the principles of justice, that 
they are trampling upon the valuable rights of Americans, confirmed to them by charter and by the constitution they themselves boast of, and convinced beyond the 
smallest doubt, that these measures are the result of deliberation, and attempted to be carried into execution 
by the hand of power, is it a time to trifle, or risk our 
cause upon petitions, which with difficulty obtain access, 
and afterwards are thrown by with the utmost contempt ? Or should we, because heretofore unsuspicious 
of design, and then unwilling to enter into disputes with 
the mother country, go on to bear more, and forbear to 
enumerate our just causes of complaint ? For my own 
part, I shall not undertake to say where the line between Great Britain and the colonies should be drawn ; 
but I am clearly of opinion, that one ought to be drawn, 
and our rights clearly ascertained. I could wish, I own, 
that the dispute had been left to posterity to determine, 
but the crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights, 
or submit to every imposition, that can be heaped upon 
us, till custom and use shall make us tame and abject 
slaves. 
</p><p>
I intended to write no more than an apology for not 
writing ; but I find I am insensibly running into a length 
I did not expect, and therefore shall conclude with remarking, that, if you disavow the right of Parliament to 
tax us, unrepresented as we are, we only differ in respect to the mode of opposition, and this difference 
principally arises from your belief, that they (the Parliament, I mean,) want a decent opportunity to repeal the 
acts ; whilst I am fully convinced, that there has been a 
regular, systematic plan formed to enforce them, and 
that nothing but unanimity and firmness in the colonies, 
which they did not expect, can prevent it. By the best advices from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> it seems, that General Gage is exceedingly disconcerted at the quiet and steady conduct 
of the people of the Massachusetts Bay, and at the 
measures pursuing by the other governments. I dare 
say he expected to force those oppressed people into 
compliance, or irritate them to acts of violence before 
this, for a more colorable pretence of ruling that and the 
other colonies with a high hand. 
</p><p>
I shall set off on Wednesday next for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
where, if you have any commands, I shall be glad to 
oblige you in them ; being, dear Sir, with real regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant. 
</p><p>
P. S. Pray what do you think of the Canada Bill?

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 9 October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 13th ultimo from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> gave me pleasure, as I learnt thereby, that you were well, and 
might be expected at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=mount vernon" rel="city">Mount Vernon</a> in your way to or from James River, in the course of the winter. 
</p><p>
When I have said this, permit me with the freedom 
of a friend (for you know I always esteemed you) to express my sorrow, that fortune should place you in a 
service, that must fix curses to the latest posterity upon the contrivers, and, if success (which, by the by, is 
impossible) accompanies it, execrations upon all those, who have been instrumental in the execution. 
</p><p>
I do not mean by this to insinuate, that an officer is 
not to discharge his duty, even when chance, not choice, 
has placed him in a disagreeable situation ; but I conceive, when you condemn the conduct of the Massachusetts people, you reason from effects, not causes ; otherwise you would not wonder at a people, who are every day receiving fresh proofs of a systematic assertion of 
an arbitrary power, deeply planned to overturn the laws 
and constitution of their country, and to violate the most 
essential and valuable rights of mankind, being irritated, 
and with difficulty restrained from acts of the greatest 
violence and intemperance. For my own part, I confess to you candidly, that I view things in a very different point of light from the one in which you seem to 
consider them ; and though you are led to believe by 
venal men, for such I must take the liberty of calling 
those new-fangled counsellors, who fly to and surround 
you, and all others, who, for honors or pecuniary gratifications, will lend their aid to overturn the constitution, 
and introduce a system of arbitrary government, although you are taught, I say, by discoursing with such men, to believe, that the people of Massachusetts are 
rebellious, setting up for independency, and what not, 
give me leave, my good friend, to tell you, that you are 
abused, grossly abused. This I advance with a degree 
of confidence and boldness, which may claim your belief, 
having better opportunities of knowing the real sentiments of the people you are among, from the leaders of 
them, in opposition to the present measures of the administration, than you have from those whose business 
it is, not to disclose truths, but to misrepresent facts in 
order to justify as much as possible to the world their 
own conduct. Give me leave to add, and I think I 
can announce it as a fact, that it is not the wish or interest of that government, or any other upon this continent, 
separately or collectively, to set up for independence ; 
but this you may at the same time rely on, that none of 
them will ever submit to the loss of those valuable rights 
and privileges, which are essential to the happiness of 
every free state, and without which, life, liberty, and 
property are rendered totally insecure. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, being certain consequences, which must 
naturally result from the late acts of Parliament relative 
to America in general, and the government of Massachusetts Bay in particular, is it to be wondered at, I 
repeat, that men, who wish to avert the impending 
blow, should attempt to oppose it in its progress, or 
prepare for their defence, if it cannot be averted? 
Surely I may be allowed to answer in the negative; and 
again give me leave to add as my opinion, that more blood will be spilled on this occasion, if the ministry are 
determined to push matters to extremity, than history 
has ever yet furnished instances of in the annals of 
North America, and such a vital wound will be given to 
the peace of this great country, as time itself cannot 
cure, or eradicate the remembrance of. 
</p><p>
But I have done. I was involuntarily led into a short 
discussion of this subject by your remarks on the conduct of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a> people, and your opinion of their 
wishes to set up for independency. I am well satisfied, 
that no such thing is desired by any thinking man in all 
North America ; on the contrary, that it is the ardent 
wish of the warmest advocates for liberty, that peace 
and tranquillity, upon constitutional grounds, may be 
restored, and the horrors of civil discord prevented. 
</p><p>
I am very glad to learn, that my friend Stewart was 
well when you left London. I have not had a letter 
from him these five years, nor heard of him I think for 
two. I wish you had mentioned his employment. 
I remain, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 8th, which is just handed to me, could not have given you more pain in writing, than it 
has given me in reading, because I never deny or even 
hesitate in granting any request, that is made to me, especially by persons I esteem, and in matters of moment, 
without feeling inexpressible uneasiness. I do not wonder at your solicitude on account of your only son. The 
nurturing and bringing him up in a proper course is, no 
doubt, an object of great concern to you, as well as importance to him ; but two things are essentially necessary in the man to whom this charge is committed, a 
capacity of judging w r ith propriety of measures proper 
to be taken in the government of a youth, and leisure 
sufficient to attend to the execution of these measures. 
That you are pleased to think favorably of me, in respect to the first, I shall take for granted, from the request you have made ; but to show my incapacity of 
attending to the latter, with that good faith, which I 
think every man ought to use, who undertakes a trust of 
this interesting nature, I can solemnly declare to yon, 
that, for a year or two past, there has been scarce a 
moment, that I could properly call my own. What with 
my own business, my present ward's, my mother's, 
which is wholly in my hands, Colonel Colvill's, Mrs. 
Savage's, Colonel Fairfax's, Colonel Mercer's, and the 
little assistance I have undertaken to give in the management of my brother Augustine's concerns (for I have 
absolutely refused to qualify as an executor), together 
with the share I take in public affairs, I have been kept 
constantly engaged in writing letters, settling accounts, 
and negotiating one piece of business or another; by 
which means I have really been deprived of every kind 
of enjoyment, and had almost fully resolved to engage 
in no fresh matter, till I had entirely wound up the old. 
</p><p>
Thus much, Sir, candor, indeed the principle of common honesty, obliged me to relate to you, as it is not my 
wish to deceive any person by promising what I do not 
think it in my power to perform with that punctuality and 
rectitude, which I conceive the nature of the trust would 
require. I do not, however, give a flat refusal to your 
request. I rather wish you to be fully informed of my 
situation, that you may think with me, or as I do, that, 
if it should please the Almighty to take you to himself 
so soon as you apprehend (but I hope without just 
cause), your son may be placed in better hands than 
mine. If you think otherwise, I will do the best I can, merely as a guardian. 
</p><p>
You. will act very prudently in having your will revised by some person skilled in the law, as a testator's 
intentions are often defeated by different interpretations 
of statutes, which require the whole business of a man's 
life to be perfectly conversant with them. I shall not, 
after what I have here said, add any thing more than my 
wishes, which are sincerely offered, for your recovery, 
and that you may live to see the accomplishment of 
your son's education. With very great esteem, Sir, 
I am your most obedient humble servant.

</p><p>
DEAR BROTHER, 
</p><p>
Mr. Smith delivered me your letter of the 16th instant, but as one is generally in a hurry and bustle in 
such places, and at such times, as these, I have only 
time to acknowledge it, and add, that it would have 
given me pleasure to meet you here. I shall refer you 
to Mr. Smith for an account of our proceedings up to 
this day, and you cannot fail of learning the rest from 
the 'Squire, who delights in the minutiae of a tale. I 
am in doubt whether we shall finish here this week; 
but as I shall delay little time on the road in returning, I 
shall hope to see you on your way up, or down, from 
Berkeley. I am much obliged to you for the hollyberries and cotton-seed. My love to my sister and the 
children. 
</p><p>
I had like to have forgotten to express my entire approbation of the laudable pursuit you are engaged in, of 
training an independent company. I have promised to 
review the independent company of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> some 
time this summer, they having made me a tender of the 
command of it. At the same time I could review yours, 
and shall very cheerfully accept the honor of commanding it, if occasion require it to be drawn out, as it is my 
full intention to devote my life and fortune in the cause 
we are engaged in, if needful, 
</p><p>
I remain, dear Sir, your most affectionate brother.

TO GEORGE WILLIAM FAIRFAX, ENGLAND. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 31 May, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Before this letter will come to hand, you must undoubtedly have received an account of the engagement 
in the Massachusetts Bay, between the ministerial 
troops (for we do not, nor can we yet prevail upon ourselves to call them the King's troops), and the provincials of that government. But as you may not have 
heard how that affair began, I enclose you the several 
affidavits, which were taken after the action. 
</p><p>
General Gage acknowledges, that the detachment 
under Lieutenant- Colon el Smith was sent out to destroy 
private property; or, in other words, to destroy a 
magazine, which self-preservation obliged the inhabitants to establish. And he also confesses, in effect at 
least, that his men made a very precipitate retreat from 
Concord, notwithstanding the reinforcement under Lord 
Percy ; the last of which may serve to convince Lord 
Sandwich, and others of the same sentiment, that the 
Americans will fight for their liberties and property, 
however pusillanimous in his Lordship's eye they may 
appear in other respects. 
</p><p>
From the best accounts I have been able to collect 
of that affair, indeed from every one, I believe the fact, 
stripped of all coloring, to be plainly this, that, if the 
retreat had not been as precipitate as it was, and God 
knows it could not well have been more so, the ministerial troops must have surrendered, or been totally cut 
off. For they had not arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a> (under cover of their ships) half an hour, before a powerful 
body of men from Marblehead and Salem was at their 
heels, and must, if they had happened to be up one 
hour sooner, inevitably have intercepted their retreat to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charlestown" rel="city">Charlestown</a>. Unhappy it is, though, to reflect, that a 
brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast, 
and that the once happy and peaceful plains of America 
are either to be drenched with blood, or inhabited by 
slaves. Sad alternative ! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice ? 
</p><p>
I am with sincere regard, and affectionate compliments to Mrs. Fairfax, dear 'Sir, your &,c. 
</p>
