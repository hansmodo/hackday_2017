Sir, 
</p><p>
The success of the proposed enterprise, must depend on the absence of the British fleet, the secrecy 
of the attempt, and a knowledge of the exact situation of the enemy. If, after you have been at the 
westward, the circumstances, from your intelligence, 
shall still appear favorable, you will be at liberty to 
be the bearer of the enclosed letter to the Count de 
Rochambeau, to whose determination I have referred 
the matter ; as any cooperation on our part, by moving 
troops towards the Sound, would give such indications 
of the design, as would effectually frustrate the success. Should you not proceed to the Count, you may 
destroy that letter. If, on the contrary, you should 
go to Newport, by keeping an account of the expenses, 
they will be repaid by the public. 
</p><p>
In the mean time, I wish you to be as particular as 
possible, m obtaining from your friend an accurate 
account of the enemy's strength on York, Long, and 
Staten Islands, specifying the several corps and their 
distributions. This, I think, from the enemy's present 
weak state, may be procured with more facility and 
accuracy than at any former period. I wish to know, 
also, the strength of the last detachment from New 
York, and of what troops it was composed. 
</p><p>
I need scarcely suggest, if you should go eastward, 
that it will be expedient to do it in such a manner as 
not to create suspicion. Indeed, secrecy is absolutely 
necessary in the whole affair. As <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> does not understand English, it may be well to 
communicate your business to the Chevalier de Chastellux in the first instance, and through him to the Coimt, lest it should accidentally get abroad in the 
communication. I am, &c.

</p><p>
My dear Laurens, 
</p><p>
Colonel Armand, who was charged with the delivery of many letters to you from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, 
imparting to his friends and the ministry of France your mission, unfortunately arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> after you 
had sailed. By him I gave you an account of the revolt of part of the Jersey troops, Arnold's expedition to 
Virginia, Leslie's arrival at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and such other matters as occurred after your departure. 
</p><p>
Since that period several interesting events have 
happened ; some favorable, others adverse. Among 
the former may be reckoned Morgan's brilliant action 
with Tarleton ; among the latter, the advantages gained 
by Lord Cornwallis over <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>. The official 
accounts of these I enclose to you. Cornwallis, after 
the defeat of Tarleton, destroyed his wagons, and made 
a violent effort to recover his prisoners, but, failing 
therein moved equally light and rapidly against <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, who, though he had formed a junction with 
Morgan, was obliged to retreat before him into Virginia. Whether from despair of recovering his prisoners, of bringing Greene to a general action, or because he conceived his own situation critical, I do not 
take upon me to determine ; but the fact is, that here commenced Comwallis's retrograde movements, and Greene's advance from the Roanoke to the place of action. 
</p><p>
On the first notice of the storm, which happened 
on the 22d of January, and of its effects, I intimated 
to the French general the possibility and importance 
of improving the opportunity in an attempt upon Arnold. When I received a more certain account of the 
total loss of the Culloden, and the dismasting of the 
Bedford, two seventy-four-gun ships belonging to the 
British fleet in Gardiner's Bay, I immediately put in 
motion, under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>, as large a part of my small force here, as I 
could with prudence detach, to proceed to the Head 
of Elk, and, with all expedition, made a proposal to 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and the Chevalier Destouches for a cooperation in Virginia with the whole 
of the fleet of our allies and a part of their land force. 
Before my proposition arrived, in consequence of an 
application to him from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, the Chevalier 
Destouches had sent a ship of the line and two or 
three frigates to the Chesapeake Bay, which not only 
retarded the plan I had proposed (by awaiting their 
return), but ultimately defeated the project ; as the enemy in the mean time remasted the Bedford with the 
masts taken out of the Culloden, and, following the 
French fleet, arrived off the Capes of Virginia before 
it ; where a naval combat ensued, glorious for the 
French, who were inferior in ships and guns, but unprofitable for us, who were disappointed of our object. 
</p><p>
The failure of this expedition, which was most flattering in the commencement, is much to be regretted ; 
because a successful blow in that quarter would, in all probability, have given a decisive turn to our affairs 
in all the southern States ; because it has been attended with considerable expense on our part, and much 
inconvenience to the State of Virginia, by the assembling of its militia ; because the world is disappointed 
at not seeing Arnold in gibbets ; and, above all, because we stood in need of something to keep us afloat, 
till the result of your mission is known ; for, be assured, my dear Laurens, day does not follow night more certainly, than it brings with it some additional 
proof of the impracticability of carrying on the war without the aids you were directed to solicit. As an honest and candid man, as a man whose all depends 
on the final and happy termination of the present contest, I assert this, while I give it decisively as my opinion, that, without a foreign loan, our present force, 
which is but the remnant of an army, cannot be kept together this campaign, much less will it be increased and in readiness for another. 
</p><p>
The observations contained in my letter of the fifth of January last are verified every moment ; and, if 
France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical 
posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should 
she attempt it hereafter. We are at this hour suspended in the balance ; not from choice, but from hard 
and absolute necessity ; and you may rely on it as a 
fact, that we cannot transport the provisions from the 
States in which they are assessed to the army, because we cannot pay the teamsters, who will no longer 
work for certificates. It is equally certain, that our 
troops are approaching fast to nakedness, and that we 
have nothing to clothe them with ; that our hospitals 
are without medicines and our sick without nutriment 
except such as well men eat ; and that all our public 
works are at a stand, and the artificers disbanding. 
But why need I run into detail, when it may be declared in r. word, that we are at the end of our tether, 
and that now or never our deliverance must come. 
While, indeed, how easy would it be to retort the enemy's own game upon them, if it could be made to 
comport with the general plan of the war to keep a 
superior fleet always in these seas, and France would 
put us in a condition to be active by advancing us 
money. The ruin of the enemy's schemes would then 
be certain ; the bold game they are now playing would 
be the means of effecting it ; for they would be reduced to the necessity of concentrating their force at 
capital points, thereby giving up all the advantages 
they have gained in the southern States, or be vulnerable everywhere. 
</p><p>
Such of the Pennsylvania Hue, as had reassembled 
and were recruited, say about one thousand, were ordered, about the middle of February, to join the southern army ; and since the disappointment of our enterprise against Arnold, I have directed the detachment 
under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> to 
proceed thither; but how either can march, without 
money or credit, is more than I can tell. With every 
wish for your success, and a safe and speedy return, 
and with every sentiment of esteem and affection, I 
am, dear Sir, &,c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure of receiving your Excellency's letter of the 6th instant only two hours ago. We are greatly indebted to the Chevalier Destouches for the 
disposition he shows to undertake the expedition to Penobscot, and to you for your readiness to furnish a 
detachment of troops for the same purpose. The object is certainly worthy of our attention, and if it 
can be effected will be very agreeable to the States, particularly to those of the east. M. Destouches can best judge, from the situation of the enemy's fleet, 
how far it may be attempted with prudence ; and your Excellency, from the information you have recently received, what number of troops will be sufficient for the enterprise. I am persuaded it will be 
calculated how far it is probable the enemy may follow with a part of their fleet ; whether the post can be 
carried by a coup de main, or may require so much time as to make it likely the operation will be interrupted before its conclusion, in case of a superior 
squadron being sent by the enemy ; and what possibility there is of protection, or a safe retreat for the 
ships, and even for the land force, through an unsettled country. All these points are too important not 
to have been well weighed, and your conversations 
with the Massachusetts deputies will have enlightened you upon them. 
</p><p>
The confidence I have in your judgment assures to you the concurrence of my sentiments, in whatever you 
may do on the occasion. I will only take the liberty to remark two things ; first, that it appears to mc frigates, without any ships of the line, will answer the purpose as well as with them, and less will be risked 
by dividing the body of the fleet. Frigates, including the forty-fours, will afford a safe escort to the troops against any thing now in those seas. With respect to 
a detachment from the enemy's fleet, it would always be proportioned to the force we should send. If we have two sixty-fours, they would even be an object 
for their whole fleet. Secondly, as despatch is essential to success, it will in my opinion be advisable not to depend on any cooperation of the militia, but to 
send at once such a force from your army, as you deem completely adequate to a speedy reduction of the post. 
</p><p>
The country in the neighbourhood of Penobscot is 
too thinly inhabited to afford any resource of militia 
there ; and to assemble and convey them from remote places would announce your design, retard your 
operations, and give leisure to the enemy to counteract you. Indeed, I would recommend, for the sake 
of secrecy, to conceal your determination from the 
State itself. These hints you will be pleased to make 
use of only so far as they appeal- to be well founded. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
My dear Marquis, 
Your favor dated at Elk the 8th instant reached 
me at ten o'clock last evening. While I give you 
credit for the manoeuvre by which you removed the British ships from before <a href='/results.php?city=annapolis' rel='city'>Annapolis</a>, I am sorry, as matters are circumstanced, that you have put yourself so 
much further from the point, which now of necessity becomes the object of your destination. Whether 
General Phillip remains in Virginia or goes further 
southward, he must be opposed by a force more substantial than militia alone ; and you will for that reason immediately open a communication with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, inform him of the numbers, situation, and 
probable views of the enemy in Virginia, and take 
his directions as to marching forward to join him, or 
remaining there to keep a watch upon the motions of 
Phillips, should he have formed a junction with Arnold at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. 
</p><p>
Every difficulty, so far as respects the wants of the officers and men, and the uneasinesses, which might arise upon their being ordered upon a more distant 
service than they expected, were foreseen, and would have been removed by recalling the detachment and 
forming another, had not the reasons of a public nature, which were mentioned in my letter of the 6th, outweighed all private considerations. 
</p><p>
You must endeavour to get shoes from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
which will be essentially necessary before you can 
move ; and, if you will cause a return to be made of 
such articles, as will probably be wanting in the course 
of the campaign, I will endeavour to forward them from 
hence, with a proportion of any stores, which may have 
been sent on by the States for their troops. If the 
officers will write back to their friends here for any 
additional baggage, of which they may stand in need, 
it shall be forwarded under careful conductors. The 
difficulties, which you will experience on the score of 
provision and transportation, would have been common 
to any other body of troops. They will I know be 
great, but I depend much upon your assiduity and 
activity. 
</p><p>
If the most distant prospect of such an operation as 
you speak of had been in my mind, I should have 
looked upon your detachment as essential to the undertaking ; but I can assure you, without entering into 
a detail of reasons, which I cannot commit to paper, 
that I have not at present an idea of being able to 
effect such a matter. This had very great weight in 
the determination of the general officers and myself; 
for we should have been very happy in an opportunity 
of succouring the southern states by a diversion, could 
it have been attempted with any tolerable hope of 
success. 
</p><p>
The small remains of the Jersey line seem necessary to form a head, to which the recruits, if any are 
obtained, may unite themselves. That line stands next 
for detachment, and therefore it is more than probable that it may soon become necessary to send the 
whole to the southward. But the reason, which I have 
just mentioned, operates in favor of keeping the remainder as long as possible. I shall be glad to hear 
from you, as to the time of your setting out from Elk, 
your prospects of getting forward, and the temper of 
the troops ; and, above all, I shall ever be happy in 
knowing that you are well, and that every thing contributes to your happiness and satisfaction, being very 
truly and sincerely, my dear Marquis, &,c.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Your two letters of the 10th came to hand last night. In mine of the 11th, I informed you as fully as it was prudent to do upon paper, that there was at present 
little or no prospect of an operation in the quarter you seem to wish. The contingencies appeared to me so 
remote, in the conversations I had with <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, that I could not justify myself in withdrawing a detachment already so far advanced towards the 
point in which relief is immediately and absolutely necessary. 
</p><p>
To have sent the detachment by water would certainly have been in every respect advantageous ; but, 
even supposing M. Destouches should consent to spare the number of ships you mention, would it be safe to 
risk so valuable a body of men, and so unequal a force, in the face of the whole British fleet? We cannot 
suppose their intelligence so bad, but they would have notice of the embarkation, and take measures to intercept it. 
</p><p>
Congress have received information through General Forman, that Sir Henry Clinton means in person to take post upon the Delaware at Newcasde. I have 
heard of no preparation at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> for an embarkation of that consequence, or of any other, and therefore I do not put much confidence in the report, upon 
so large a scale. A party may perhaps be going into the Delaware Bay to interrupt the commerce of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and draw supplies from the disaffected near 
the shores. I expect to hear of some desertions from you in consequence of your move ; but the composition of your troops is good, and, if the officers enter 
upon the service with alacrity, I have no doubt but the men will soon forget their attachments in this 
quarter, and follow cheerfully. I am, &c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Colonel Harrison, who has acted as my secretary 
since the beginning of 1776, has accepted an honorable and profitable civil appointment in the State of 
Maryland, and is gone to enjoy it. The circle of my 
acquaintance does not furnish a character, that would 
be more pleasing to me as a successor to hun, than 
yourself. I make you the first offer, therefore, of the 
vacant office, and should be happy in your acceptance 
of it. The pay is one hundred dollars a month ; the 
rations those of a Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, 
which in fact are additional, as the value thereof is 
received in money. No perquisites appertain to the office. The secretary lives as I do, is at little expense while he is in my family, or when absent on 
my business, and is in the highest confidence and estimation from the nature of his office. I mention these 
things for your information, and shall be happy in a 
speedy and favorable answer, being, with great esteem 
and regard, &c.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your private letter of the 18th ultimo came safe to hand. Although the honors of the field did not fall to your lot, I am convinced you deserved them. The 
chances of war are various, and the best concerted measures, and the most flattering prospects, may and often do deceive us ; especially while we are in the 
power of militia. The motives which induced you to seek an action with Lord Cornwallis, are supported upon the best military principles ; and the consequences, if you can prevent the dissipation of your 
troops, will no doubt be fortunate. Every support, that it is in my power to give you from this army, shall cheerfully be afforded ; but if I part with any more 
troops, I must accompany them, or have none to command, as there is not at this moment more than a garrison for <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, nor can I tell when there w ill be. 
</p><p>
I am much pleased to find by your letter, that the State of Virginia exerts itself to your satisfaction. My 
public and private letters strongly inculcate the necessity of this ; and I have again urged Congress to use every means in their power to facilitate the march 
of the Pennsylvania line ; as also to recruit, equip, and forward Moylan's dragoons to you with despatch. 
</p><p>
I should be very sorry on any occasion to hurt the feelings of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>, whom I esteem as a very 
valuable officer. But in the instance you have mentioned, there is no cause of complaint ; for, if he will 
advert to his own letters to me, he will find that there 
was a great probability of his having marched with a 
detachment to reinforce you. Besides which there 
was a necessity for sending a general officer with the detachment from hence, and political considerations, as 
it was to be a combined operation depending upon 
critical circumstances with a French land and sea 
force, pointed to the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a>. These 
are the facts, the knowledge of which must, I am persuaded, satisfy the Baron. 
</p><p>
I am truly sensible of the merit and fortitude of the 
veteran bands under your command, and wish the 
sentiments I entertain of their worth could be communicated with the warmth I feel them. It was my 
full intention to request you to thank Morgan and the 
gallant troops under his command for their brilliant 
victory ; but the hurry, in which my letters are too 
often written, occasioned the omission at the time I 
acknowledged the official account of that action. 
</p><p>
Your conjecture respecting the cause of the mutiny in the Pennsylvania line has more substantial ground 
for its support, than the letter of the member of Congress ; and I am mistaken if the licentious conduct of 
that line was not more the effect of an overcharge of spirits, on the 1st of January, than of premeditated design. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to tell you, that, as far as I am acquainted with the opinion of Congress with respect to your conduct, it is much in your favor. That this is the sentiment of all the southern delegates I have 
great reason to believe, because I have it declared to me in explicit terms by some of them. I have received a letter from Mr. Custis, dated the 29th ultimo, in which are these words. " <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> has 
by his conduct gained universal esteem, and possesses in the fullest degree the confidence of all ranks of people." He had then just returned from the Assembly at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>. I hope the disorder, of which 
you complained, was no other than the effect of over fatigue, and that you are now perfectly well. That successes equal to your merits and wishes may attend 
you, is the ardent desire of, dear Sir, &c.

</p><p>
My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Though the situation of southern affairs would not permit me to recall your corps to this army, yet it was with great reluctance I could resolve upon seeing you separated from head-quarters. My friendship for you 
makes me desirous of having you near me, and there will occur frequent occasions in cooperative measures, in which it would be of the greatest utility I should have it in my power to consult you. These motives 
would have induced me to propose to you to return personally to head-quarters, had I not believed you would not choose to quit your corps, and had I not foreseen a difficulty in giving you a command in the 
remaining troops. A select corps you could not have, and there are so many major-generals, who conceive themselves in a manner wedded to the different lines, and who are to be provided for, that it would not be 
easy at present to accommodate matters to your having a command in the line. But this difficulty might be overcome, and I cannot forbear, late as it is, leaving it at your option to proceed with your corps or 
return personally to head-quarters. If the last should be your choice, you will give orders to the officer you leave in command to march with all the necessary precaution, and take the orders of <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a>. 
You will at the same time write to the Baron, communicating to him your instructions, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> informing him of your return. 
</p><p>
If you resolve to proceed forward, I shall have one 
consolation, which is, that from the present aspect of 
things it is perhaps most probable the weight of the 
war this campaign will be in the southern States, and 
it will become my duty to go there in person, where 
I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again. Of 
this I would not have you say any thing. 
</p><p>
April 22nd. — The reasons assigned in some of your letters, and others which have occurred to me, chiefly of a political nature, assure me that great advantages 
will be derived from your being wherever the French army and the American head-quarters are. I therefore not only repeat the offer contained in the enclosed 
letter, but accompany it with a wish, that you may return, if you can consistently with your own inclination relinquish your present command for the prospects I have mentioned; not else, as it always has 
been and ever will be my wish to make things as agreeable to you as the nature of the service will admit. I cannot recall the detachment for reasons, which 
in my judgment are conclusive. The accidents to which letters are liable forbid me, miless I could write 
to you in cipher, to go into a fuU explanation of some matters, of which you seem not to be well informed, and in which I wish to set you right ; but I dare not 
attempt it in a common letter, nor will there be any necessity for it if you return. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry, that any letter of mine should be the subject of public discussion, or give the smallest uneasiness to any person living. The letter, to which 
I presume you allude, was a confidential one from me to Mr. Lund Washington, with whom I have lived in perfect intimacy for nearly twenty years. I can neither 
avow the letter, as it is published by Rivington, nor 
declare that it is spurious, because my letter to this 
gentleman was written in great haste, and no copy of 
it was taken. All I remember of the matter is, that, 
at the time of writing it, I was a good deal chagrined 
to find by your letter of the 15th of March, from 
Yorktown in Virginia, that the French fleet had not at 
that time appeared within the Capes of the Chesapeake ; and I meant ui strict confidence to express my 
apprehensions and concern for the delay. But as we 
know that the alteration of a single word does oftentimes pervert the sense, or give a force to the expression, unintended by the letter-writer, I should not be 
surprised if Rivington, or the inspectors of his gazette, 
have taken that liberty with the letter in question ; 
especially as he or they have, I am told, published a 
letter from me to Governor Hancock and his answer, 
which never had an existence but in the gazette. 
That the enemy fabricated a number of letters for me 
formerly is a fact well known ; that they are not less 
capable of doing it now, few will deny. As to his asserting, that this is a genuine copy of the original, he 
well knows that their friends do not want to convict 
him of a falsehood, and that ours have not the opportunity of doing it, though both sides know his talents for lying. 
</p><p>
The event, which you seem to speak of with regret, my friendship for you would most assuredly have 
induced me to impart to you in the moment it happened, had it not been for the request of H , who desired that no mention should be made of it. 
Why this injunction on me, while he was communicating it himself, is a little extraordinary. But I complied, and religiously fulfilled it. With every sentiment 
of affectionate regard, I am, &c.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received your several letters, and am extremely concerned at the temper of your detachment, and the desertions that are taking place. I imagine 
however that these would have been nearly as great in any other corps that might have been sent, and, after the Pennsylvania line, I think it would be ineligible to 
detach any other State line. We learn by experience, that they are not only dissipated on the march, but, being at a great distance from their States, are almost 
entirely neglected. Few recruits are raised for thera, and these few are lost on the way. We see how totally the Maryland line has declined, and how little is 
doing to reestablish it ; a line formerly among the most numerous and respectable in the army. Our plan at present appears to me to be to commit the defence of 
the southern States to the States as far as Pennsylvania inclusive, and to make up by detachment any additional succours, that may be necessary. We must 
endeavour to compensate these detachments for the loss of State supplies by giving them a larger proportion of Continental. On this principle I am sending to 
you the articles mentioned in the enclosed list ; twelve hundred shirts, twelve hundred linen overalls, twelve hundred pairs of shoes, twelve hundred pairs of socks, 
and one hundred hunting-shirts, which set out two days ago from this place. I have also urged the Board of War to do their best for you. 
</p><p>
Colonel Vose shall be relieved. If there is any good 
officer of an eastern line here desirous of the command, he must have it. I mentioned to you, that I had a warm remonstrance soon after your departure 
from the Massachusetts line, on the manner of appointing officers for your corps. If there should be no officer of the proper rank desirous of the command, I 
shall be glad to employ Lieutenant-Colonel Smith. I will see what can be done in the case of Major Galvan. I wish at all events to retain Gimat ; but it will be 
difficult to remove the one without the other. 
</p><p>
It appears to me extraordinary, that your ad\ices 
should have given you an idea so different from the 
whole complexion of the intelligence I had received, 
concerning the probability of a certain event. This, 
and the situation of our own force, have induced me 
to regard it as barely possible ; too precarious to enter 
far into our dispositions ; possible only in a case, which 
we are not authorized to expect will happen. I dare 
not trust the details on which this opinion is founded 
to paper. 
</p><p>
The danger to the southern States is immediate and 
pressing. It is our duty to give them support. The 
detachment with you, all circumstances considered, was 
the most proper for the purpose. The project, which 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> has lately adopted, adds a particular 
motive to continuing its destination. It is essential to 
him, that Phillips should be held in check ; and we 
cannot wholly rely on militia for this. As to a transportation by water, while the enemy command the 
Chesapeake and Cape Fear, I do not see how it is 
practicable. The only cause of hesitation in my mind, 
about sending your corps to the southward, w^as a 
separation from you. I refer you to private letters 
accompanying this, one written previously to your last, 
the other subsequently. As to our force here, you 
know what it was when you left us, and you will know 
what it is now, when I tell you that we have as yet 
but few recruits. The enemy's present force of regular troops at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is near seven thousand. I 
shall recommend Major Macpherson, as you request, 
to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>. Present my warmest thanks to 
that officer and assure him of the sense I have of his 
services. 
</p><p>
You were right, my dear Marquis, in supposing that 
no explanation could be necessary as to your letter to 
the Board of War. I know your sentiments and your 
friendship. I shall not detain the express to enlarge 
on the other subjects of your letters. I will embrace 
the first safe opportunity to give you a full view of 
our affairs, what we are, and what we expect to be, 
that you may regulate your future correspondence with 
your court accordingly. Hitherto I could give you 
nothing material, more than you know, as to ourselves.

a piece of intelligence from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which it may 
be material for you to know. It is, that Colonel Connolly, who formerly lived upon the Ohio, who was 
taken in the year 1775, and lately exchanged, is to 
proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=quebec' rel='city'>Quebec</a>, as soon as the season will permit, 
with as many refugees as he can collect at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; 
that he is to join Sir John Johnson in Canada; and 
that they are to proceed, with their united forces, by 
the route of Birch Island and Lake Ontario to Venango. Their object is to be <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a> and the western posts. It is also said, that Connolly carries blank 
commissions, which are to be given to persons already 
in the country, and that there are several hundred 
persons now in the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=fort pitt' rel='city'>Fort Pitt</a>, who 
are to join him. As this last corresponds with a suspicion, which <a href='/results.php?tla=dab' rel='co-worker'>Colonel Brodhead</a> entertains, I have written to him to take measures to secure or remove

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. You must remember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line the last campaign, occasioned by the appointment of Major Macpherson, and you know the 
uneasiness that at this moment exists among the eastern troops on account of the commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan, although it was the result of absolute necessity. 
</p><p>
Should circumstances admit of the formation of another advanced corps, of which I see very little prospect from present appearances, it can be but small, 
and must be composed almost entirely of eastern troops ; and to add to the discontents of the officers 
of those lines by the further appointment of an officer of your rank to (lie comiuaiKl of it, or in it, would, I 
and certain, involve nie in a difficulty of a very disagrecat)Io and delicate nature, and niiujht perhaps lead 
to conseciuences more serious than it is easy to imagine. Wiiile I adhere firmly to the right of making 
such appointments as you request, I am at the same time obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that right too far, more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so critical as the present. 
</p><p>
I am convinced, that no officer can with justice dispute your merit and abilities. The opposition heretofore made has not been for the want of those qualifications in the gentlemen, who are and have been the 
objects of discontent. The officers of the line contend, without having reference to particular persons, 
that it is a hardship and reflection upon them to introduce brevet officers into commands, of some permanence, in which there are more opportunities of 
distinguishing themselves, than in the line of the army 
at large, and with the men they have had the trouble 
to discipline and prepare for the field. 
</p><p>
My principal concern arises from an apprehension, 
that you will impute my refusal of your request to 
other motives, than those I have expressed ; but I beg 
you to be assured I am only influenced by the reasons, which I have mentioned. I am, dear Sir, &,c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I assure your Excellency, that I feel extreme pain at 
the occasion of that part of your letter of the 26th 
instant, which relates to an intercepted letter of mine 
published by the enemy. I am unhappy that an accident should have put it in their power to give to the 
world any thing from me, which may contain an implication the least disagreeable to you, or to the Chevalier 
Destouches. I assume you sincerely, that I have no 
copy of the original letter in my possession, so that I 
am unable by a comparison to determine how far the 
publication may be just. The enemy have fabricated 
w hole letters for me, and even a series of letters ; and 
it is not improbable that they may have given a different 
turn to some of my expressions in the present instance. 
It would however be disingenuous in me not to acknowledge, that I believe the general import to be true. 
The copy, however, which your Excellency has sent to 
me, differs in some respects from that which the enemy 
have publish'd, as you will perceive by the enclosed 
Gazette. Whatever construction it may bear, I beg your Excellency will consider the letter as private to 
a friend, a gendeman who has the direction of my affairs at home, totally unconnected with public affairs, 
and on whose discretion I could absolutely rely. No idea of the same kind has ever gone to any public body. 
</p><p>
When I say, that I believe the general import of the 
publication to be true, I mean it in this sense, that there 
did appear to me a degree of delay in executing the 
enterprise suggested by me, of the causes of which 
I was not well apprized, and an idea of this kind was 
probably expressed in my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel=''>Mr. Washington</a>. 
As to the apparent insinuation, that the first expedition 
had been preferred to the one proposed by me, I could 
not have intended to convey it, in its fullest latitude, 
because it would have been unjust. I could not but 
have recollected, that my formal proposal did not reach 
you till after the departure of the first squadron, though 
the suggestion of it was previous. ]My letter however 
was written in haste, and might have been inaccurately 
expressed. I have lately learnt, though not officially, 
that the cause of the delay I have alluded to was a 
want of supplies for the fleet. Impressed with a real 
esteem for and confidence in the Chevalier Destouches, 
I have heard this circumstance with satisfaction. 
</p><p>
With this explanation, I leave the matter to his candor and to yours, and flatter myself it will make no 
impressions inconsistent with an entire persuasion of 
my sincere esteem and attachment. I have the honor 
to be, with perfect respect, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Fully impressed with the idea of the utility of early, regular, and accurate communication of the kind in contemplation, I shall make no difficulty in acceding to the 
proposal contained in your private letter from Newport. But at the same time that I am engaging in behalf of the United States a liberal reward for the services of the 
C s, of whose fidelity and ability I entertain a high opinion, it is certainly but reasonable, from patriotism 
and every other principle, that their exertions should be proportionably great, to subserve essentially the interest 
of the public. All the interior and minute arrangements of the correspondence I request that you will settle 
with them as expeditiously and advantageously as may be, and especially that you will urge, in very forcible 
terms, the necessity of having the communication as circumstantial, frequent, and expeditious as possible. 
</p><p>
The great objects of information you are very well acquainted with ; such as arrivals, embarkations, preparations for movements, alterations of positions, situations 
of posts, fortifications, garrisons, strength or weakness of each, distribution and strength of corps, and, in general, every thing which can be interesting and important for us to know. 
</p><p>
Besides these, you are also sensible there are many things upon a smaller scale, which are necessary to be reported, and that whatever intelligence is communicated ought to be, not in general terms, but in detail, 
and with the greatest precision. At present I am anxious to know (lor the reports have been very nunicroiis, 
vague, and uncertain), whether another cniharkalion is 
preparing, ani-l, it" so, to what amount, and where destined ; what the present force of the enemy is, particularly on Long Island, in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and at Kingsbridge ; what corps are at the latter place, how strong, 
and where posted exactly ; and, indeed, what the situation, prospects, and designs of the enemy are, so far 
as they can be penetrated. I am, &,c.

</p><p>
Dear Lund, 
</p><p>
I am very sorry to hear of your loss. I am a little sorry to hear of my own ; but that which gives me 
most concern is, that you should go on board the enemy's vessels, and furnish them with refreshments. It 
would have been a less painful circumstance to me to 
have heard, that in consequence of your non-compliance 
with their request, they had burnt my house and laid 
the plantation in ruins. You ought to have considered 
yourself as my representative, and should have reflected on the bad example of communicating with the enemy, and making a voluntary offer of refreshments to 
them with a view to prevent a conflagration. 
</p><p>
It was not in your power, I acknowledge, to prevent 
them from sending a flag on shore, and you did right to 
meet it ; but you should, in the same instant that the 
business of it was unfolded, have declared explicitly, 
that it was improper for you to yield to the request; 
after which, if they had proceeded to help themselves 
by force, you could but have submitted ; and, being 
unprovided for defence, this was to be preferred to a 
feeble opposition, which only serves as a pretext to 
bum and destroy. 
</p><p>
I am thoroughly persuaded, that you acted from your 
best judgment, and believe, that your desire to preserve my property, and rescue the buildings from impending danger, was your governing motive ; but to 
go on board their vessels, carry them refreshments, 
commune with a parcel of plundering scoundrels, and 
request a favor by asking a surrender of my negroes, 
was exceedingly ill judged, and, it is to be feared, will 
be unhappy in its consequences, as it will be a precedent for others, and may become a subject of animadversion. 
</p><p>
I have no doubt of the enemy's intention to prosecute the plundering plan they have begun ; and unless 
a stop can be put to it, by the arrival of a superior naval force, I have as little doubt of its ending in the loss 
of all my negroes, and in the destruction of my houses ; but I am prepared for the event ; under the prospect of which, if you could deposit in a place of safety the 
most valuable and least bulky articles, it might be consistent with policy and prudence, and a means of preserving them hereafter. Such and so many things as 
are necessary for common and present use must be 
retained, and must run their chance through the fiery 
trial of this summer. I am sincerely yours.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
The freedom of your communications is an evidence 
to me of the sincerity of your attachment ; and every 
fresh instance of this gives pleasure and adds strength 
to the bond, which unites us in friendship. In this 
light I view the intimation respecting the conduct of 
Mr. Lund Washington. Some days previous to the receipt of your letter, which only came to my hands yesterday, I received an account of this transaction from 
that gentleman himself, and immediately wrote and forwarded the answer, of which the enclosed is a copy. 
This letter, which was written in the moment of my 
obtaining the first intimation of the matter, may be considered as a testimony of my disapprobation of his 
conduct, and the transmission of it to you, as a proof of my friendship ; because I wish you to be assured, 
that no man can condemn the measure more sincerely than I do. 
</p><p>
A false idea, arising from the consideration of his being my steward, and in that character more the trustee 
and guardian of my property than the representative 
of my honor, has misled his judgment and plunged him 
into error, upon the appearance of desertion among my 
negroes, and danger to my buildings ; for sure I am, 
that no man is more firmly opposed to the enemy than 
he is. From a thorough conviction of this, and of his integrity, I entrusted every species of my property to 
his care, without reservation or fear of his abusing it. 
The last paragraph of my letter to him was occasioned 
by an expression of his fear, that all the estates convenient to the river would be stripped of their negroes 
and movable property. 
</p><p>
I am very happy to find, that desertion had ceased, 
and content had taken place, in the detachment you 
command. Before this letter can reach you, you 
must have taken your ultimate resolution upon the 
proposal contained in my letters of the 21st and 22d 
ultimo, and have made the consequent arrangements. 
I shall be silent, therefore, on the subject of them ; and 
only beg, in case you should not return to this army, 
and the papers were not lost with your other baggage 
(on which event give me leave to express my concern), 
that you would permit Mr. Capitaine to furnish me 
with copies of the drafts, and the remarks of the pilots 
(taken at Colonel Dey's) on the entrance of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. It is possible they may be wanted ; and I am not able to furnish them without your 
assistance. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Washington, and the rest of my small family, 
which at present consists only of Tilghman and Humphreys, join me in cordial salutations ; and, with sentiments of the purest esteem and most affectionate regard, I remain, my dear Marquis, &lc.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received with exceeding great satisfaction and pleasure your favor of the 18th of April, and am extremely rejoiced to learn, that the spirit of discontent 
had so entirely subsided, and that the parade of desertion would probably be totally stopped among the troops under your command. The measures you had 
taken to obtain, on your own credit, a supply of clothing and necessaries for the detachment, must entitle you to all their gratitude and affection ; and will, at the 
same time that it endears your name, if possible, still 
more to this country, be an everlasting monument of 
your ardent zeal and attachment to its cause, and the 
establishment of its independence. For my own part, 
my dear Marquis, although I stood in need of no new 
proofs of your exertions and sacrifices in the cause of 
America, I will confess to you, that I shall not be able 
to express the pleasing sensations I have experienced 
at your unparalleled and repeated instances of generosity and zeal for the service on every occasion. Suffer me only to pursue you with my sincerest wishes, 
that your success and glory may always be equal to 
your merits.

interesting papers were not with it. Should the map of the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, with remarks made on it

Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a>, second in command, and an 
officer whose high rank and consideration entitle him 
to particular notice and attention, is prevailed upon to 
proceed to the several eastern States, to represent the 
present distresses of the army for want of provision, 
and the consequences which must inevitably ensue, unless a more regular system and more vigorous measures for aflbrding supplies are speedily adopted. 
</p><p>
From the post of <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a> to that of Dobbs's Ferry 
inclusive, I believe there is not (by the returns and reports I have received) at this moment one day's supply 
of meat for the army on hand. Our whole dependence 
for this article is on the eastern States ; their resources 
I am persuaded are ample. To request and urge that 
they may be drawn forth regularly, and to be informed 
with precision and certainty what may absolutely be 
depended upon through the campaign, are the objects 
of this application. 
</p><p>
I have already made representations to the States, of the want of provisions, the distress of the army, and 
the innumerable embarrassments we have suffered in consequence ; not merely once or twice, but have reiterated them over and over again. I have struggled to the utmost of my ability to keep the army together, 
but all will be in vain without the effectual assistance of the States. I have now only to repeat the alternative, which has been so often urged, that supplies, particularly of beef-cattle, must be speedily and regularly 
provided, or our posts cannot be maintained, nor the nnny la-pt in ihe held much longer. I entreat your Excellency, that this representation may be received in 
the serious light it is meant and deserves, or that I may stand exculpated from the dreadful consequences, which must otherwise inevitably follow in a very short time. 
I enter not into the detail of matters, as <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a> will be able to give your Excellency every necessary information, as well as to lay the proper estimates of 
supplies for the campaign before you. I am, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Not having seen or heard of any resolve of Congress for establishing the principles of promotion in the army, 
I am apprehensive that the report of the committee, who had this matter under consideration, is now sleeping in Congress. This, and a recent instance in the 
Pennsylvania regiment of artillery in proof of the absolute necessity of adopting some mode, by which the whole army may be bound, and a stop thereby be put 
to those disputes, which keep it in a continual state of distraction and discontent, are the reasons for my troubling you again on this subject, and praying that some 
decision may be come to by Congress. It is much 
easier to avoid disagreements, than to remove discontents ; and I again declare, that if my differing in sentiment from the opinions of the committee in some 
points has been the occasion of delay, I would, rather than have the matter lie over a moment, yield a free 
assent to all their propositions ; for any principle is better than none. I also wish, though this is more a matter of private than public consideration, that the business could be taken up on account of Mr. Tilghman, 
whose appointment seems to depend upon it ; for, if there are men in the army deserving the commission proposed for him, he is one of them. 
</p><p>
This gentleman came out a captain of one of the 
light infantry companies of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and served in 
the flying camp in 1776. In August of the same year 
he joined my family, and has been in every action in 
which the main army was concerned. He has been a 
zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithful 
assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of 
which time he refused to receive pay. Honor and 
gratitude interest me in his favor, and make me solicitous to obtain his commission. His modesty and 
love of concord placed the date of his expected commission at the 1st of April, 1777, because he would 
not take rank of Hamilton and Meade, who were declared aids in order (which he did not choose to be) 
before that period, although he had joined my family, 
and done all the duties of one, from the 1st of September preceding. 
</p><p>
My public letters to Congress will have informed you of the situation of this army, and I have no scruple in giving it as my decided opinion, that, unless a capital 
change takes place soon, it will be impossible for me to maintain our posts, and keep the army from dispursing. 
</p><p>
The resolution of Congress to appoint ministers of war, foreign affairs, and finance, gave, as far as I was able to learn the sentiments of men in and out of the 
army, universal satisfaction. Postponing the first, delaying the second, and disagreeing about the third, have had the directly contrary effect ; and I can venture 
to assure you, not from random guess or vague information, that the want of an able financier, and of a proper plan for the disposition of foreign loans, will be a greater bar to the obtaining of them than perhaps Congress are aware. I could say more on this subject, 
were I at liberty ; but I shall only add, that there is not in my opinion a moment to be lost in placing a proper character at the head of our finance, that he may as soon as possible enter upon the duties of his office. I am, &,c.

I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
letter of the 11th instant. Give me leave to congratulate you on your safe arrival, and your appointment to 
the command of his Most Christian Majesty's fleet and 
sea forces upon these coasts. It affords me no small 
degree of pleasure to find the command devolve upon 
an officer of your Excellency's distinguished character.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I am glad to find, that you have received the necessary papers, and are entering upon the measures for interrupting the enemy's communications. I hope you 
will be enabled, by the assistance of the person proposed, if he is found sufficiently faithful and intelligent, to prosecute those measures to good effect ; because I 
think the intelligence obtained through that channel of Count d'Estainnr, and commanded his vanguard when he forced the 
entrance of tins harbour." — .Yewport, May SIh. 
</p><p>
The following is an extract from the instructions sent by the Minister 
of War to <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, dated Versailles, March 7th. 
</p><p>
1. It is the intention of his Majesty, that you do not abandon Rhode 
Island, if the squadron destined to act in concert with you for its defence 
cannot retire to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> without hazard, or before it shall be relieved from 
its defensive position at Rhode Island by a superior naval force. 
</p><p>
2. I will inform you, that, in the month of July or August, the superior naval force of which you have just received notice, will withdraw the 
squadron of M. de Barras from the harbour of Rhode Island ; and you 
will carefully reserve to yourself the knowledge of this arrangement, 
which may be accelerated. 
</p><p>
3. If, by unforeseen events, or any cause whatever, the army of 
Washington should be broken up and dispersed, it is the intention of the 
King, that, under these circumstances, you should decline acceding to 
any orders or requests of that general to penetrate into the interior of 
the continent ; as in that case it would be prudent to reserve yourself, 
and to retire to the Antilles if possible, or to St Domingo, according to 
the season. 
</p><p>
4. If, on the contrary, the American army remains in its present 
slate, and yet without being able to undertake any combined operation 
with the squadron ; and if this latter should attempt any other enterprise, 
where the concurrence of a certain number of land forces would be required, the King leaves it in your power to furnish them, provided that 
the plan be concerted with the American general. 
</p><p>
5. Should there be an opportunity for the squadron at Rhode Island 
to act independently of the American army, you are aware that the naval 
forces of the King should concur in all operations, which are considered 
advantageous to the common cause. 
</p><p>
6. You are also aware, that, as long as the King's troops occupy Rhode Island, the transports destined to receive the troops are to be 
kept there ; when, on the contrary, the army under your command shall 
penetrate into the country, and the squadron abandons Rhode Island, 
this squadron will proceed to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and take with it the transports, 
that have been retained. 
</p><p>
7. If, from the different causes mentioned, you should remain in 
your position at Rhode Island, and a superior naval force of the King 
should withdraw the squadron which is in that port, I give you notice, 
that the Count de Grasse has orders to leave with you two vessels to 
defend the port, and the transports necessary for your army.
</p><p>
I have been exceedingly distressed by the repeated accounts I have received of the sufferings of the troops on the frontier, and the terrible consequences which 
must ensue, unless they were speedily supplied. What gave a particular poignancy to the sting I felt on the 
occasion was my inability to afford relief. Such partial supplies as were on hand, to the very last barrel of meat, I ordered instantly to be sent, and have promised 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> what further succour the States will enable me to give. Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='co-worker'>General Heath</a> has gone to the several eastern States, to enforce my pointed representations, to rouse them to more vigorous exertions, 
and to make arrangements for supplies during the whole campaign. I cannot but hope this measure will 
be attended with success. I am, &,c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
My partial acquaintance with either our naval or commercial affairs makes it altogether impossible for me to 
account for the unfortunate delay of those articles of 
military stores and clothing, which I have been informed have been so long provided in France. If I had 
had any particular reason to suspect you of being 
accessory to that delay, which I assure you was not 
the case, my suspicions would have been removed by 
the very full and satisfactory answers, which you have, 
to the best of my judgment, made to the questions 
proposed to you by the Board of Admiralty, and upon which that Board have in their report to Congress 
testified the high sense, which they entertain of your 
merits and services. 
</p><p>
Whether our naval affairs have been well or ill conducted, it would be presumptuous in me to determine. 
Instances of bravery and good conduct in several of 
our officers have not been wanting. Delicacy forbids 
me to mention the particular one, which has attracted 
the admiration of all the world, and influenced a most 
illustrious monarch to confer a mark of his favor, that 
can be attained only by a long and honorable service, 
or by the performance of some brilliant action. That 
you may long enjoy the reputation you have so justly 
acquired, is the sincere wish of Sir, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received intelligence, that a party of the enemy are establishing themselves at or near <a href='/results.php?city=fort lee' rel='city'>Fort Lee</a>, 
and building a blockhouse, or some kind of work. If 
they are permitted to complete their plan, it will not only be difficult to remove them, but they will harass the 
country from thence, and may be much in the way of 
some future operation. When I formed the battalion, 
which you at present command, it was with a view of 
having a corps ready to execute a project of the kind, 
which I propose to you, and that is, to endeavour to 
strike by surprise the party above mentioned. You 
will without loss of time see Captain Lawrence, who 
commands the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> levies near Dobbs's Ferry, 
and concert measures with him for gaining certain intelligence of the real strength and situation of the enemy ; and, if you find them such as seem to give you a 
tolerable certainty of success, you will plan your attack 
in such manner, as shall be best warranted from your information. the sooner it is done the better, as the 
enemy, if they are fortifying, will be every clay stronger. 
You will take Captain Lawrence under your command, 
with the levies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and any Jersey militia 
you may find embodied ; but you will trust no officer 
among them, nor any other but Lawrence, with your 
design. lie is sensible and appears discreet. 
</p><p>
As I coiiiide very much in your prudence and judgment, I shall only give you these general directions ; 
namely, to attempt nothing, which may have the appearance of rashness, and to guard well against being 
drawn into an ambuscade, or being intercepted by a 
sudden reinforcement from York Island. Captain Lawrence's party, who must be acquainted with every foot 
of the ground, ought to secure you against the former ; 
and guards, at the practicable landing-places, will certainly prevent the latter. I shall set out in the morning 
for Connecticut, and shall be absent six or seven days. 
If you make the attempt, I wish you every success. 
I am with great regard, &lc.

Sir, 
</p><p>
The letter, which I have the honor to enclose from 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, will, I imagine, inform you 
of the intended march of the French army towards the 
North River, and of the destination of the King's 
squadron now in the harbour of Newport, if circumstances will admit of the respective movements. I 
should be wanting in respect and confidence, were I 
not to add that our object is <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The season, 
the difficulty and expense of land transportations, and 
the continual waste of men in every attempt to reinforce the southern States, are almost insuperable objections to marching another detachment from the army 
on the North River ; nor do I see how it is possible to 
give effectual support to those States, and avert the 
evils which threaten them, while we are inferior in naval force in these seas. 
</p><p>
It is not for me to know in what manner the fleet 
of his Most Christian Majesty is to be employed in the 
West Indies this summer, or to inquire at what epoch 
it may be expected on this coast ; but the appearance 
and aid of it in this quarter are of such essential importance in any offensive operation, and so necessary to 
stop the progress of the enemy's arms at the southward, that I shall be excused, I am persuaded, for endeavouring to engage your good offices in facilitating an 
event on which so much depends. For this I have a 
stronger plea, when I assure you, that <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>General Rochambeau</a>'s opinion and wishes concur with mine, and 
that it is at his instance principally I make to you this 
address. 
</p><p>
If we are happy enough to find your Excellency in 
sentiment with us, it will be in your power to inform 
the Count de Grasse of the strength and situation of 
the enemy's naval and land force in this country, the 
destination of the French squadron under Admiral Barras, and the intentions of the allied arms if a junction 
can be formed. At present the British fleet lies within 
Block Island, and about five leagues from Point Judith. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and the Chevalier Chastellux agree perfectly in sentiment with me, that, while affairs remain as they now are, the West India fleet 
should run immediately to Sandy Hook (if there are no concerted operations), where they may be met with all the information requisite, and where most likely it will 
shut in, or cut off. Admiral Arbuthnot, and may be 
joined by the Count de Barras. An early and frequent 
communication from the Count de Grasse would lead to 
preparatory measures on our part, and be a means of 
facilitating the operation in hand, or any other, which 
may be thought more advisable. I know your goodness and your zeal for the common cause too well, to 
offer any thing more as an apology for this liberty ; and 
I persuade myself it is unnecessary for me to declare 
the respect and attachment, with which I have the 
honor to be, &,c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of a conference held between the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> and myself at this place, the French army will march, as soon as circumstances will 
admit, and form a junction with the American army upon the North River. The accomplishment of the 
object, which we have in contemplation, is of the utmost importance to America, and will, in all probability 
be attained, unless there should be a failure on our part In the number of men, which will be required for 
the operation, or the enemy should withdraw a considerable part of their force from the southward. It is in 
our own power, by proper exertions, to prevent the former; and, should the latter take place, we shall be amply repaid our expenses, by liberating the southern States, 
where we have found by experience we are vulnerable. 
</p><p>
Upon the calculations, that I have been able in concert with some of the most experienced French and 
American officers to form, the operation in view will 
require, in addition to the French army, all the Continental  battalions from New Hampshire to New Jersey 
inclusive to be completed to their full establishment. 
You must be sensible, that the measures taken for that 
purpose, in consequence of the last requisition of Congress, have been very far from answering the end ; as 
few recruits, comparatively speaking, have yet been 
sent forward, and of those, many have been discharged 
on account of their inability. You must also take into 
consideration, that a number of those men, who were 
returned when the requisition was made, have since 
been taken off by the various casualties incident to an 
army ; I estimate about one sixth of the whole number, and therefore provision must at this time be made 
to replace them. 
</p><p>
From what has been premised, you will perceive, 
without my urging further reasons, the necessity I am 
under of calling upon you in the most earnest manner, 
to devise means to send into the field without delay 
the number of men, which has been already voted for 
the completion of the battalions of your State, and the 
further deficiency of one sixth just mentioned. The 
term of three years, or for the war, would undoubtedly 
be preferable to any shorter period ; but if they cannot be obtained on those conditions, necessity must 
oblige us to take them for the campaign only, which 
ought to be reckoned to the last day of December. I 
should hope, that, by proper exertions in collecting and 
sending forward the men that have been already raised, 
and compelling by vigorous and decisive methods the 
delinquent towns to furnish their quotas, the greater 
part of the men may be collected by the 1st of July. 
</p><p>
Arguments surely cannot be wanting to impress the legislature with a due sense of the obligation, which they are under, of furnishing the means now called for. 
The enemy, counting upon our want of ability, or upon our want of energy, have, by repeated detachments to the southward, reduced themselves in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> to a 
situation, which invites us to take advantage of it ; and, should the lucky moment be lost, it is to be feared that they will, after subduing the southern States, raise 
a force in them sufficient to hold them, and return again to the northward with such a number of men, as will render <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> secure against any force, which 
we can at this time raise or maintain. Our allies in this country expect and depend upon being supported by us in the attempt, which we are about to make, and 
those in Europe will be astonished, should we neglect the favorable opportunity, which is now offered. 
</p><p>
As it is probable, that some militia, in addition to the full complement of Continental troops, may be necessary to support communications and for other purposes, 
you will be pleased to direct four hundred men to be held in readiness to march within one week after I 
shall call for them, to serve three months after they 
have joined the army. And I would take the liberty 
of requesting, that the executive may be vested with 
full powers, during the recess, to comply with any further requisition I may make for men, provisions, or 
the means of transportation, which last may be most 
essential in the course of our operations, should it become necessary to bring provisions or stores from a 
distance. 
</p><p>
I shall be glad to be favored with an answer as soon 
as possible, with an assurance of what I may depend 
upon ; that, if I do not clearly see a prospect of being 
supported, I may turn my views to a defensive instead 
of an offensive plan, and save the States and our allies 
the expense, which would be needlessly incurred by 
any but an ample and effectual preparation.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
No arguments were necessary to convince me of the very great public utility, which would result from the 
success of the plan you proposed laying before Congress. Had I been unapprized of the advantages, which might be derived to our cause from a successful 
attempt, or even a powerful diversion in that quarter, the reasons you have offered would have carried irrefragable demonstration with them, and induced me to 
be of your opinion. But the distressed and embarrassed state of our affairs, on account of supplies, with which you are well acquainted, the languid efforts of the 
States to procure men, and the insuperable difficulties in the way of transportation, would, I apprehend, have rendered the scheme abortive in the first instance. 
And I must inform you, that there is yet another obstacle, which makes the attempt you have suggested absolutely impracticable by the means you propose, but 
which I am not at liberty to commit to paper for fear of the same misfortune, which has already happened to some of my letters. 
</p><p>
You will have seen before the receipt of this, by my 
public letter to Congress of the 27th instant, the result of the deliberations of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> 
and myself at Weathersfield. That plan, upon the maturest consideration, and after combining all the present 
circumstances and future prospects, appeared, though 
precarious, far the most eligible of any we could possibly devise, whilst we are inferior at sea. The object was considered to be of greater magnitude, and 
more within our reach, than any other. The weakness 
of the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, the central position for 
drawing together men and supplies, and the spur, which 
an attempt against that place, would give to every exertion, were among the reasons, which prompted to that 
undertaking, and promised the fairest prospect of success, unless the enemy should recall a considerable part 
of their force from the southward. And even in this 
case, the same measure, which might produce disappointment in one quarter, would certainly in the event 
afford the greatest relief in another. While an opportunity presents itself of striking the enemy a fatal blow, 
I will persuade myself, that the concurring exertions of 
Congress, of the several States immediately concerned, 
and of every individual in them, who is well affected 
to our cause, will be united in yielding every possible 
aid. At this crisis, while I rejoice at the appointment 
of the minister of finance, I have sincerely to regret, 
that the ministers of the other departments have not 
also been appointed, especially a minister of war. At 
the same time I am happy to learn, that the mode of 
promotion is on the point of being finally established. 
With the highest sentiments of regard, I am, &c.

Your conduct upon every occasion meets my approbation, but in none more than in your refusing to hold a

The difficulties, which you daily encounter and surmount with your small force, add not a little to your 
reputation ; and I am pretty well assured, that, should 
you be obliged finally to withdraw from South Carolina 
and even from North Carolina, it will not be attributed 
to your want either of abilities or of exertion, but to 
the true cause, the want of means to support the war 
in them. I feel for your mortification at the loss of the 
day before Camden, after it seemed so much in your 
favor; but I hope you will have found, that the enemy 
suffered severely, as in their publication of the affair in

reduction of Fort Watson does honor to <a href='/results.php?tla=frm' rel='co-worker'>General Marion</a> and Colonel Lee. 
</p><p>
I have lately had an interview with <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> at Weathersfield. Our affairs were very attentively considered in every point of view, and it was 
finally determined to make an attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
with its present garrison, in preference to a southern 
operation, as we had not the decided command of the 
water. You will readily suppose the reasons, which 
induced this determination, were the inevitable loss of 
men from so long a march, more especially in the approaching hot season, and the difficulty, I may say impossibility, of transporting the necessary baggage, artillery, and stores by land. If I am supported as I 
ought to be by the neighbouring States in this operation, which you know has always been their favorite 
one, I hope that one of these consequences will follow, 
either that the enemy will be expelled from the most valuable position which they hold upon the continent, or be obliged to recall part of their force from the 
southward to defend it. Should the latter happen, you 
will be most essentially relieved by it. The French 
troops will begin their march this way as soon as certain circumstances will admit. I can only give you the 
outlines of our plan. The dangers, to which letters are 
exposed, make it improper to commit to paper the 
particulars ; but as matters ripen I will keep you as 
well informed as circumstances will allow. 
</p><p>
A detachment of between fifteen hundred and two 
thousand men sailed from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> about the 13th of 
May. I advised <a href='/results.php?tla=frs' rel='co-worker met'>Baron Steuben</a> of this, and desired 
him to communicate it to you. I presume they will 
either stop in the Chesapeake Bay or Cape Fear River, 
unless the operations of the Spaniards in the Floridas 
should call for reinforcement to that quarter. But I 
can hardly flatter myself, that they will attend to the 
preservation of St. Augustine. We are told that Pensacola has fallen. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> informed me, that about 
eight hundred recruits would be ready to march from 
Virginia by the latter end of May. I have no certain 
accounts from Maryland lately ; but I was told by a 
gentleman from thence, that about four hundred might 
be expected to march in April. I make no doubt but 
you are kept regularly advised by the superintending 
officers. I have not heard, that <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a> had 
left Yorktown, but I have reason to believe he has 
gone before this time. If no fresh discontents arise 
among those troops, the detachment with Wayne will 
be a most valuable acquisition to you. They are chiefly 
the old soldiers, and completely furnished with every 
necessary. I am, &,c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I had last evening the honor of receiving your favor of the 31st of May by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, who informs me, that he is authorized by your Excellency 
and Count de Barras to enter into a free communication with me upon the subject of the council of war 
held on board the Duke de Bourgogne, and request my opinion upon the propriety of their determination. 
</p><p>
I must confess to your Excellency, that there is weight in the reasons, which are offered for the detention of his Majesty's fleet in the harbour of Newport, 
in preference to its going round to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; but as I 
cannot think, that it will be as safe in all possible cases 
in the harbour of Newport, after the greater part of the 
French army has been withdrawn, as it would be in 
the harbour of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, I must adhere to my opinion, 
and to the plan fixed at Weathersfield, as most eligible, all circumstances considered. I would not, however, set up my single judgment against that of so 
many gentlemen of experience, more especially as the 
matter partly depends upon a knowledge of marine 
affairs, of which I candidly confess my ignorance. I 
would, then-fore, in order to avoid delay, rest the matter upon the following footing. If your Excellency, the 
Count de Barras, and the other gentlemen should, upon further consideration of the subject, aided by any 
new information, which you may have received, still 
think it most advisable to adhere to the former resolution of the council, you may make use of the enclosed 
letters to the governors of Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island, which are left open for your inspection. If, on the contrary, you should change your opinions, the letters may be destroyed, as that which was written by 
me to the governor of Rhode Island from Weathersfield will be sufficient for the purpose of calling out five 
hundred militia for the present, and such further numbers as exigencies may require. 
</p><p>
At any rate, I could wish that the march of the 
troops might now be hurried as much as possible. 
The strides, which the enemy are making at the southward, demand a collection of our force in this quarter, 
that we may endeavour to commence our operation. 
I know of no measure, which will be so likely to afford relief to the southern States, in so short a time, 
as a serious menace against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This your 
Excellency may remember was a principal inducement 
for our undertaking that operation, in preference to the 
other, which was spoken of; and I assure you the calls 
upon me from the southward are so pressing, that nothing but seeing our preparations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> m some degree of forwardness will content them, or 
convince them that they are likely to derive any advantages from the force, which they see detained here. I have the honor to be, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The present conveyance is sudden and unexpected. I have only time, therefore, to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 29th ultimo, and to assure you, that I felt a most sensible pleasure when I heard of 
your acceptance of the late appointment of Congress to regulate the finances of this country. My hand and heart shall Ix- with you; and, as far as my assistance can go, coinnianil il. We have, I am persuaded, but

you with how much truth and sincerity, I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In my letter of the 28th ultimo, I informed you of 
the succours you might expect, if necessary. The six companies of Van Schaick's regiment have since sailed. 
Hazen's will follow to-morrow. I have now to communicate my sentiments in general, respecting the disposition and application of this force. 
</p><p>
It is clearly my opinion, that the reinforcements lately 
ordered to the northward should be kept together as 
much as circumstances will admit, or at least so near 
as to be speedily assembled upon an emergency ; as 
it is not certain or probable, that they will be continued permanently in that quarter, and as they are 
designed while there to strike the enemy, should they 
be so presumptuous as to attempt to penetrate into 
the country. It also appears to me, that the force on 
the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers ought not to be so 
widely scattered as formerly, but stationed in as compact a manner as may be, except such light parties 
as occasion may require to be kept out. By distributing the troops, with a view of protecting every inch 
of ground, the efficient force is dissipated and lost, 
and the several posts are so weakened as to invite 
the enemy to enterprise. I wish you therefore to concentrate your strength as much as possible at the points 
you may judge most expedient, to form a plan of defence for the frontier, and to transmit to me the result of your determination. I am, dear Sir, &c.t

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The freedom of your communications is highly pleasing to me. The portrait you have drawn of our affairs is strictly agreeable to the life, and you do me 
but justice m supposing, that my mind is fortified 
against, or rather prepared for, the most distressing 
accounts that can be given of them. It would not be 
the part of friendship, therefore, to conceal any circumstance, from an unwillingness to give pain, especially as the knowledge of it, to a man determined not 
to smk under the weight of perplexities, may be of 
the utmost importance. But we must not despair ; the 
game is yet in our own hands ; to play it well is all 
we have to do, and I trust the experience of error 
will enable us to act better in future. A cloud may 
yet pass over us, individuals may be ruined, and the 
country at large, or particular States, undergo temporary distress ; but certain I am, that it is in our power 
to bring the war to a happy conclusion. 
</p><p>
My public letters to Congress, and in a more especial manner my private communications to Governor Rudedge, will bring you fully acquainted with the situation of things in this quarter, and the prospects before us. How far we shall be able to extricate ourselves from the former, and realize the latter, time only can show. I have great expectations from the 
appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Mr. Morris</a>, but they are not unreasonable ones; for I do not suppose, that by any magic art he can do more than recover us by degrees from the labyrinth into which  our finances are plunged. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry for the disagreeable situation of our suffering soldiery at <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and wish they could 
be relieved without adding to the pressure under which we at present groan. How far it is in <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>'s power to liberate, by exchange, our prisoners in that 
quarter I know not ; but he has all the authority I can give to do this, reserving the troops of convention from 
his disposal. With those I have trouble enough. In a late interview between the two commissaries of prisoners, Mr. Loring refused to exchange <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, unless the prisoners taken at the Cedars are 
allowed for, which is opposed by a resolve of Congress ; and he has actually refused to pay a debt of privates, which three months ago he promised to do.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The progress, which the enemy are making in Virginia, is very alarming, not only to the State immediately invaded, but to all the rest ; for I strongly suspect, from the most recent European intelligence, that 
the enemy are endeavouring to make as large seeming conquests as possible, that they may urge the plea of 
uti possidetis in the proposed mediation. Your Excellency will be able to judge of the probability of this 
conjecture from the circular letter of the President of Congress. 
</p><p>
Were it prudent to commit a detail of our plans and 
expectations to paper, I could convince you by a variety of reasons, that my presence is essential to the 
operations, which have lately been concerted between 
the French commanders and myself, and which are to 
open in this quarter, provided the British keep possession of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There have lately been rumors of 
an evacuation of that place, but I do not put confidence in them. Should I be supported by the neighbouring States in the manner which I expect, the enemy will, I hope, be reduced to the necessity of recalling 
part of their force from the southward to support New 
York, or they will run the most imminent risk of being expelled, with great loss of stores, from that post, 
which is to them invaluable while they think of prosecuting the war in America ; and should we, by a lucky 
coincidence of circumstances, gain a naval superiority, 
their ruin would be inevitable. The prospect of giving 
relief to the southern States, by an operation in this 
quarter, was the principal inducement for undertaking 
it. Indeed we found, upon a full consideration of our 
affairs in every point of view, that, without the command of the water, it would be next to impossible for 
us to transport the artillery, baggage, and stores of the 
army to so great a distance ; and, besides, we should 
lose at least one third of our force by desertion, sickness, and the heats of the approaching season, even 
if it could be done. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency may probably ask whether we are to remain here for the above reasons, should the enemy evacuate <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and transfer the whole wtuto the southward. To this I answer without hesitation, 
that we must in such case follow them at every expense, and under every difficulty and loss ; but that, 
while we remain inferior at sea, and there is a probability of giving relief by diversion, and that perhaps 
sooner than by sending reinforcements immediately to the point in distress, policy dictates the trial of the former. 
</p><p>
Allow me, before I take leave of your Excellency in 
your public capacity, to express the obligations I am 
under for the readiness and zeal with which you have 
always forwarded and supported every measure, which 
I have had occasion to recommend through you, and to 
assure you, that I shall esteem myself honored by a 
continuation of your friendship and correspondence, 
should your country permit you to remain in the private walk of life. I have the honor to be, &,c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
I am honored by your Excellency's favors of the 
9th and 10th instant, and with their very interesting 
communications, which you may be assured will be 
kept perfectly secret. I flatter myself, that the whole 
convoy will arrive in safety in some of the eastern 
ports, as I believe the British ships are all cruising off 
the Hook. 
</p><p>
The Count de Barras has furnished me with the result of the second council of war I have so high a 
respect for the opinions of the gentlemen, who composed it, that I should have been satisfied had they 
barely mentioned their adherence to their former determination ; but the new arguments, which have been introduced in favor of the detention of the fleet at 
Rhode Island, leave me no room to doubt the propriety of the measure. 
</p><p>
I am so fully convinced, that your Excellency will 
make no unnecessary delay in your march, that I have 
only occasion to repeat my former request, that it may 
be commenced as soon as circumstances will admit. 
My last accounts from the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='co-worker met friend'>Marquis De Lafayette</a> were 
of the 3d of June. The British army, in very considerable force, were then between <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> ; their destination was uncertain ; but from 
their superiority they were at full liberty to go wherever they pleased. The enclosed copy of a letter from 
the President of Congress to me will give the latest 
intelligence from South Carolina. 
</p><p>
Your requisitions to the Count de Grasse extend to 
every thing I could wish. You cannot, in my opinion, 
too strongly urge the necessity of his bringing a body of 
troops with him, more especially as I am very doubtful, 
whether our force can be drawn together by the time 
he proposes to be here. Now four thousand or five 
thousand men, in addition to what we shall certainly 
have by that time, would, almost beyond a doubt, enable us with the assistance of the fleet to carry our object. It is to be regretted, that the Count's stay upon 
the coast will be limited. That consideration is an additional reason for wishing a force equal to giving a 
speedy determination to the operation. 
</p><p>
Your Excellency will recollect, that <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> was 
looked upon by us as the only practicable object under 
present circumstances ; but should we be able to secure 
a naval superiority, we may perhaps find others more 
practicable and equally advisable. If the frigate should 
not have sailed, I wish you to explain this matter to 
the Count de Grasse ; for, as I understand it, you have 
in your communication to him confined our views to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> alone. And, instead of advising him to run 
immediately into the Chesapeake, will it not be best to 
leave him to judge, from the information he may from 
time to time receive of the situation of the enemy's fleet upon this coast, which will be the most advantageous quarter for him to make his appearance in ? In the letter, which was written to the minister from 
Weathersfield, in which he was requested to urge the Count to come this way with his whole fleet, Sandy Hook was mentioned as the most desirable point ; because, by coming suddenly there, he would certainly 
block up any fleet, which might be within; and he would even have a very good chance of forcing the 
entrance, before dispositions could be made to oppose him. Should the British fleet not be there, he could 
follow in the Chesapeake, which is always accessible to a superior force. I am, &,c.

Sir, 
</p><p>
Having been made acquainted by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with the design of the Count de Grasse to 
come to this coast with his fleet, I cannot forbear expressing my ardent wishes, that a body of land forces 
might also attend this naval armament ; for I am apprehensive, that such a decided superiority of men may 
not be drawn together by the time Count de Grasse 
will be here, as to insure our success against the enemy's most important posts. His continuance in these 
seas may also be limited to a short period ; and the 
addition of a respectable corps of troops from the West 
Indies would, in all human probability, terminate the 
matter very soon in our favor. 
</p><p>
If these should likewise be your sentiments, and if 
this plan should not interfere with the intentions and 
interest of his Most Christian Majesty elsewhere, I entreat your Excellency, by the first good conveyance, to 
represent the propriety and necessity of the measure 
to the commanders in the West Indies ; that by one 
great and decisive stroke the enemy may be expelled 
from the continent, and the independence of America 
established at the approaching negotiation.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a>, enclosing the examination of two prisoners 
who were taken lately by one of his scouts ; from 
whence it appears the enemy in Canada have not 
made any movements in force, or preparations for an 
incursion ; and indeed this intelligence corresponds so 
exactly with that which has been received through 
other channels, that I cannot but regret having sent 
the reinforcement to the northward, at a time when 
the aid of every man was so essential to the success 
of the operations in contemplation. 
</p><p>
As it will be indispensably necessary, when we advance towards the enemy's lines, to withdraw the regular force from the northward, I have thought proper to 
advise <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> and your Excellency of it, that 
provision might be made as far as practicable to replace these troops with the men engaged for the campaign and the three years' service. At the same time 
that I express my unhappiness at being forced to the 
measure, and assure your Excellency, that nothing but 
necessity could induce me to recall the Continental 
troops, I wish it may be understood, that, when the moment of operating arrives, there is not any consideration which can persuade me to counteract the plan, that 
has been concerted between the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> 
and myself. But lest the enemy should attempt to 
take advantage of their absence, to make inroads on 
the frontier, in order to distract our attention and cause 
a diversion in favor of their most important post, I beg 
leave to recommend in the strongest terms, that every 
means in your power should be made use of to guard 
against such an event. 
</p><p>
I will also take the liberty to suggest, whether an 
additional security might not be afforded to those posts, 
which are exposed to the ravages of the enemy, by 
my sending a Continental officer to assist in rousing 
and assembling the force of the country, and to put 
himself at the head of such militia and volunteers, as 
might be drawn together on an emergency from the 
district of country called Vermont ; and whether, in that 
case, Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jhs' rel='co-worker'>General Stark</a> would not be a proper 
character to employ on this service, especially as he 
has already obtained a reputation from his successes 
in that quarter, and is undoubtedly a man of bravery, 
and has been accustomed to command irregular troops 
in action. It appears to me, that a popular officer in 
that situation would be extremely advantageous on 
many accounts. Whether there may be reasons of 
state against it, I know not. I have, therefore, submitted it to your consideration. I beg your opinion 
freely on the subject, and have the honor to be with 
great respect, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I can easily conceive the disappointment and mortification you have suffered, upon finding the flattering 
prospects of filling your line so unexpectedly blasted, 
by the anxious sensations I have experienced on the 
same subject. If what has been so often urged and 
repeated will not excite the States to the most strenuous exertions, in completing the Continental battalions, 
I almost despair of success from any thing I can add to 
my former representations, arguments, and entreaties. 
</p><p>
This however should not relax our unremitting endeavours to serve our country to the extent of our abilities 
in every possible way. 
</p><p>
The desire you express for active service is very 
commendable. I beg you will be persuaded, that I 
have not the least inclination to restrain so laudable a 
passion. You will therefore be at liberty to attempt 
to rouse the spirit of the country, and put yourself at 
the head of the cavalry, in the manner you propose. 
I sincerely 'wish your efforts may be crowned with 
success. If the State has not already appointed a 
general officer to command the State troops, destined 
for the southern service, I could wish these troops might also be put under your orders. Possibly it might be well to present an offer of your services, and 
to intimate that you have my consent to accept this command, if the State should think proper to confer it upon you. I am, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Upon finding it necessary, for the operations of the campaign, to recall the Continental troops from the northward, I have ordered six hundred militia from the 
counties of Berkshire and Hampshire to that quarter, in addition to the militia and State troops of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> ; and I have now to request that you will take the general command of all the troops in that department, 
as soon as may conveniently be done. I am induced to appoint you to this command from your knowledge of, and influence amongst, the inhabitants of that country. 
</p><p>
You will be pleased, therefore, to repair to <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, 
and establish your head-quarters at that place, detaining with you four hundred of the troops from Massachusetts, and sending the other two hundred to Colonel Willett, who will remain in command on the Mohawk

to render essential service there.

In case of an incursion of the enemy, you will make such dispositions as you shall judge most advantageous 
for opposing them, and protecting the frontier, (not withdrawing the troops from the Mohawk River.) I rely upon it, that you will use your utmost exertions to 
draw forth the force of the country from the Green Mountains, and all the contiguous territory ; and I doubt  not your requisitions will be attended with success, as 
your personal influence must be unlimited amongst those people, at whose head you have formerly fought and conquered with so much reputation and glory. 
</p><p>
I request that you will be very particular in keeping up proper discipline, and preventing the troops from committing depredations upon the inhabitants. Believe 
me to be, dear Sir, &-c.

I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
favor of the 23d instant from <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>. It would have 
given me the greatest pleasure could I have made it 
convenient to meet you at Newtown ; but independently of many arrangements, which are necessary at 
the first taking of the field, I am detained by the hourly 
expectation of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a>. I am 
pleased to find, that your idea of the position, which 
will be proper for the troops under your command, coincides exactly with my own ; and I shall be happy in 
giving your quartermaster-general every assistance in 
reconnoitering and marking out your camp. 
</p><p>
Lieutenant-Colonel Cobb, one of my aids-de-camp, 
will have the honor of delivering to you this letter, and 
will return to me with any despatch or message, which 
your Excellency may wish to communicate ; or, should 
you rather incline to come forward from Newtown 
before the army. Colonel Cobb will be proud to attend 
you. I shall be much obliged if your Excellency will 
present to the Count de Barras, by the next occasion, 
my sincere thanks for the readiness with which he was 
pleased to accept the proposition I had the honor to 
make to him through your Excellency. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your opinion of the absolute necessity of a repeal 
of all Under laws, before a new species of paper, 
though upon ever so good an establishment, will gain 
credit with the public, is certainly founded upon reason and justified by experience. I am extremely 
obliged to you for the assistance you have already 
afforded us in the article of flour. Without that aid, 
we should have been already distressed ; and I must 
confess to you, that I see no prospect of being supplied, but through your means, as, by the last letters 
from the President and Council of Pennsylvania, I could 
expect little or nothing from that quarter. Whether 
the Assembly, in their present session, have adopted 
any more vigorous measures to obtain supplies, I have 
not yet been informed. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='co-worker met'>General Schuyler</a> a few days ago acquainted you, 
that there were more considerable quantities of flour 
upon the North River, than he had expected. The 
ease and cheapness of transporting any in that situation will undoubtedly induce you to secure what may 
be in that quarter, should you find yourself enabled to 
extend your purchases. I have the honor to be, with 
perfect respect and esteem, &,c.

My dear Marquis,

The last letter that I have had the pleasure of receiving from you is dated the 3d instant. I have 
since that heard a thousand vague reports of your situation, and that of the enemy, but none of them satisfactory. I fear some of your letters have miscarried, 
as, from your usual punctuality, I am certain you must 
have written in that time. I hope your next will confirm the accounts, which I have this day received from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='co-worker'>General St. Clair</a>, that Lord Cornwallis had retreated 
to the south side of James River. 
</p><p>
The army moved out of their quarters a few days

<a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a>, with the van of the French 
army, will be at Newtown, forty-two miles from hence, 
this night. You are acquainted with our general plan. 
Particulars I dare not enter into, before I am assured from yourself, that there is no danger of any letters fulling among those clouds of light troops, which you tell now surrounded Lord Cornwallis's army. I enclose 
a paper, containing some very agreeable accounts from 
India. I hope, from the circumstance of a part of 
them being published by the East India House in 
London, that they are well founded. Be assured, my 
dear Marquis, that my anxiety to hear from you is 
increased by my sincere regard for you, and by the 
interest I take in every thing which concerns you.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The enclosed letter to the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> is 
of very great importance, and requires the utmost secrecy in its communication. This idea you will convey to the Count before its delivery, to effect which 
you will first converse with the Chevalier Chastellux 
on the mode of its communication. Its object is to 
inform the Count, that I have in contemplation a very 
sudden surprise of some post of the enemy, which will 
be of very great importance in our operations, and 
which we have flattering expectations of obtaining ; to 
cover and support which, if obtained, we shall want the 
aid of the French army ; in which case, it will be necessary for the Count to push on his troops with greater 
haste, than he at present intends, and by a different 
route from that now in his view. The <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>'s legion is to advance. 
</p><p>
The movements, which I would wish to be made by 
the French army, are particularized in my letter to the Count, which you will see. It will be for you to impress the gentlemen with the miportance of their motions to support our operations, as it will be to httle 
purpose for us to obtain advantages, which we may not 
be able to maintain. 
</p><p>
As the Count, with his troops, is now in a very disaffected part of the country, and the Tories will be 
desirous to give every information in their power, the 
most profound secrecy will be necessary. Secrecy and 
despatch must prove the soul of success to the enterprise. This idea you will impress with energy, using 
your best discretion in the mode. I am, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
In the fullest confidence I inform you, that I intend to make an attempt by surprise upon the enemy's posts on the north end of York Island, on Monday night. 
Should we be happy enough to succeed, and be able to hold our conquest, the advantages will be greater 
than can be well imagined. But I cannot flatter myself, that the enemy will permit the latter, unless I am 
suddenly and considerably reinforced. I shall march 
down the remainder of this army, and I have hopes that 
the French force will be near at hand by that time. 
But I shall, notwithstanding, direct die alarm-guns and 
beacons to be fired in case of success ; and I have to 
request, that yom Excellency will, upon such signals, 
communicate the meaning of them to the militia, and 
put yourself at the head of them, and much with the 
utmost expedition towards Kingsbridge, bringing with 
you three or four days' provision at least. In that time I think we shall have so arranged matters as to have Utde need of the militia suddenly called out. I have, 
upon a hope that we shall succeed, ordered Brigadier-<a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> to send down the regular troops immediately. Should circumstances make it necessary, 
I can countermand the order. I am, &,c.

<p>
Instructions. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
The object of your present command, — consisting of two regiments, formed into four battalions, under the 
command of Colonel Scammell and Lieutenant-Colonel Sprout, of a detachment of artillery under the command of Captain Burbeck, of the corps of watermen 
under the command of Major Darby, and the waterguard under the command of Captain Pray, — is to attempt the surprise of the enemy's posts upon the north end of York Island. 
</p><p>
My ideas, as to the most probable mode of attaining this object, have been minutely detailed in the several conversations which we have had upon the subject, 
and you have been furnished with such papers as I 
have been able to collect, and upon which my judgment has been formed. But it is not my wish, or desire, that these should be any restraint upon you. 
Your own observation and the circumstances of the 
moment must in a great degree govern you. 
</p><p>
The success of your enterprise depending absolutely 
upon secrecy and surprise, it w ill be wrong to prosecute it a moment after you are discovered, unless the 
discovery is made so near the works, that you may, by 
a rapid movement, gain them before the enemy have 
time to recollect and put themselves in a posture of 
defence. Fort George, upon Laurel Hill, ought to be 
your primary object, because success at that place will 
open a communication with the main, afford an asylum 
to the troops, who may be disappointed in other attacks, and secure a retreat in case of necessity to the 
main body of the army. 
</p><p>
Should you carry Fort Knyphausen and Fort Tryon only, you cannot without infinite risk hold them, as we shall not be in a situation to support you from without. 
I would therefore recommend your damaging them as much as you possibly can and relinquishing them. The artillery-men will be proportionably divided for the three 
attacks ; each party will be provided with two lanterns and two rockets, one of which is to be fired in each work as soon as it is carried. 
</p><p>
It" complete success should attend the enterprise, not 
a moment should be lost in drawing the boats across 
the Island from the North River into Haerlem Creek, 
and securing them under the guns of Fort George, if 
circumstances will admit of it. But in case of a disappointment, and being obliged to retreat by water, 
and not being able to pass the enemy's ships and boats, 
the dernier resort must be a push over to the Jersey 
shore, and an abandonment of the boats, if they cannot 
be drawn up the bank and carried ofT on carriages. It 
will be very essential, that I should be made acquainted 
as early as possible with your success, and the extent 
of it. If complete, you will announce it by the firing 
of thirteen cannon, at one minute's interval, after all less 
firing and confusion have ceased. If Fort George only 
is carried, six cannon are to be fired in the same manner. For Fort Knyphausen, Tryon, or both of them, 
you need not give a signal, because you are, as before 
directed, immediately to relinquish them. 
</p><p>
The foregoing is upon a supposition, that the principal object, the attempt upon the works on York 
Island, is carried into execution ; hut, should you, upon 
reconnoitering the enemy to-morrow, find it unadvisable 
to prosecute the plan, or should you be obliged to give 
it over on account of an early discovery by the enemy's 
shipping or boats, I would then have you turn your attention to the support of an attempt, which is also to 
be made on the morning of the 3d by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> upon Delancey's corps lying at Morrisania. 
To effect this, you will land your men at any convenient place above the mouth of Sphen Devil Creek, 
and march to the high grounds in front of Kingsbridge, 
where you will lie concealed until the Duke's attack is 
announced by firing or other means. You may then 
dispose of your force in such a manner, in view of the 
enemy, as to make them think your party larger than 
it is, which may have the double effect of preventing 
them from coming over the bridge to turn the Duke's 
right, and also of preventing any of Delancey's party 
from escaping that way. Your further operations must 
depend upon the movements of the enemy and other 
circumstances. 
</p><p>
I expect to be in the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge 
early in the morning of the 3d, with the remainder of 
the army. I shall as soon as possible open a communication with you, and give you such orders as the 
general state of matters may require. If you land upon the east side of the river, above the mouth of Spiten Devil Creek, you will send your boats up along 
the east shore. If Major Darby receives no particular 
directions from me, he will proceed with them to King's 
Ferry. Given at Head-Quarters, near <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city origin'>Peekskill</a>, this

under your command, and form a junction at Clapp's, 
in King Street, with Colonel Sheldon, who is to be at 
that place on the "id instant. I am now to inform you, 
that you will also be joined at the same time and place 
by the French legion, under the command of the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a>, who is a brigadier in the service of his

put yourself and troops under his orders and command, 
he being furnished with my instructions for his movement subsequent to meeting you at Clapp's.

As the Duke will be a stranger to that part of the 
country, which is to be the scene of your operations, 
it will be in vour power to give him much assistance 
and information, which I have not a doubt but you will 
do with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity. The

The arrangement you have made, for the periods

agrees perfectly with my ideas of the matter ; as I think 
we must be certainly able to determine ultimately upon our plan of operations by the time they are to be 
in motion. 
</p><p>
An enterprise, which I have long had in contemplation, will be executed in the course of this night, if 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='co-worker'>General Lincoln</a>, who commands the operating party, 
finds the attack advisable upon reconnoitring the situation of the enemy, and he can do it by surprise. 
The enterprise is against the posts upon the north 
end of York Island. The remainder of the army 
marched this morning towards Kingsbridge. Part of 
the French troops were last night at Ridgebury, and 
will be at Bedford this evening. They will, in the course of to-morrow, be at hand to support us, should 
there be occasion. At the same time that the posts upon York Island are attempted, I have planned a surprise upon Delancey's corps at Morrisania, which is 
to be executed by the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='co-worker'>Duke De Lauzun</a> in conjunction with Slu'kK)n's regiment and Waterbury's State troops. 
</p><p>
Should we succeed in the attempt upon the posts, every effort will be made to hold them, and your assistance will be naturally necessary. I shall take the 
speediest method of communicating the event to <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='co-worker'>General McDougall</a> at <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a>, who will bring out the militia to our support. You may therefore take it for

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I sincerely congratulate you on the favorable turn of affairs announced in your last, and I hope you will be enabled to maintain that superiority, which you seem to be gaining over Lord Cornwallis. We have had a 
variety of reports of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>'s further successes in South Carolina. By some we are told, that both <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> and Ninety-Six have fallen, but in a letter, 
which I have just received from Monsieur Marbois, he says that <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> has been taken, and the siege of Ninety-Six raised. <a href='/results.php?tla=cdr' rel='co-worker met'>Count De Rochambeau</a> formed a junction with me at the camp, about twelve miles from 
Kingsbridge, a few days ago. We are waiting for reinforcements to the Continental line, and for militia, and are in the mean time establishing our communication at Dobbs's Ferry. 
</p><p>
I shall shortly have occasion to communicate matters of very great importance to you, so much so, that I 
shall send a confidential officer on purpose. You will in the mean time endeavour to draw together as respectable a body of Continental troops as you possibly can, and take every measure to augment your cavalry. 
Should the enemy confine themselves to the lower country, you will no doubt pay attention to the formation of magazines above. These will be in every case 
essential, whether the war continues in Virginia, or 
whether it shall still be carried on in South Carolina. 
Should <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> come into Virginia in person, 
you will be good enough to communicate the foregoing to him. 
</p><p>
In the present situation of affairs, it is of the utmost 
importance that a communication by a chain of expresses should be opened between this army and that in 
Virginia. They are already established from hence to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and if there is none from you to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, you will be pleased to take measures for having it formed. You will also endeavour to establish 
such a communication with the coast, as to be able to 
know whether any troops are detached by sea from 
Lord Cornwallis's army ; for it is more than probable, 
that, if he finds himself baffled in attempting to overrun Virginia, he will take a strong post at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
or <a href='/results.php?city=williamsburg' rel='city'>Williamsburg</a>, and reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or South 
Carolina. Should any detachment be made, you will 
transmit to me the earliest intelligence. What you say 
in confidence of the conduct of a certain officer shall 
be kept a profound secret, and I will contrive means 
of removing him from the quarter where he is so unpopular. 
</p><p>
The Rhode Island regiment is so thinly officered, 
that Colonel Olney wishes one of the subalterns of the 
light company may be suffered to return, when Captain Olney joins. You will act in this as circumstances 
may permit. You have the compliments and good 
wishes of all your friends in the French army. Those 
of the American are not behindhand with them. With 
the warmest affection and esteem, I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your favors of the 2d and 5th instant have afforded 
me infinite satisfaction, as the measures you are pursuing for subsisting the army perfectly accord with my 
ideas, and are, I am certain, the only ones, which can 
secure us from distress or the constant apprehensions 
of it. Had magazines of any consequence been formed in the different States, in pursuance of the late requisitions of Congress, the disposal of the articles collected at a distance from the army would have merited 
your attention ; but so little has been done in that way, 
that I imagine you will not think the matter worthy of 
notice, when I inform you of the trilling quantities 
which remain on hand. No magazines of flour have 
been formed at any place. No salt meat was put up 
in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. There had 
been, by estimate, seven or eight thousand barrels of 
meat and fish put up in Connecticut, of which between 
two and three thousand have come forward, and the remainder is, I believe, in motion. Massachusetts put up very little salt meat, and most of it has been consumed 
upon the communication by the recruits, or transported 
to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>. Rhode Island purchased one thousand barrels, of which about six hundred remain at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, 
and I would wish them to be still kept there for a particular purpose. I could never learn, with certainty, 
how much was put up in New Hampshire ; but I have 
directed all that was at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> to be transported 
by water to <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, as I wish to form a small magazine of salt provision at that place, as I mentioned 
before, for a particular purpose. No magazines of rum 
have been formed. We have been in a manner destitute of that necessary article, and what we are now 
likely to draw from the several States will be from hand 
to mouth. From the foregoing state of facts you will 
perceive in how small a degree the requisitions of 
Congress have been complied with, and may form a 
judgment of the miserable manner in which the army 
has been subsisted. 
</p><p>
Having lately, at the request of the Board of War, 
furnished them with my opinion of the quantity of provision, which ought to be laid up at the several posts, 
they will be able, at the interview which you propose 
to have with them, to lay before you my ideas upon the 
subject of a contract for supplying the army. I beg 
you to be assured, that I never can think your correspondence tedious or troublesome. Duty as well as 
inclination will always prompt me to listen with pleasure to your observations upon the state of our public 
affairs ; and I shall think myself happy, if I can in any 
manner contribute to assist you in the arduous task 
you have undertaken. I shall very anxiously wait for 
the visit, which you promise to make me. I am, with 
very sincere respect and esteem, &c.

My Lord, 
</p><p>
While I am with the detachment of the army below, you will remain in command here. Your principal attention will be paid to the good order of the camp, and 
the security of the baggage and stores left in it. There will be no need of advanced pickets, as you will be fully covered in front. The camp guards should he 
vigilant, and the officers commanding them should see that the men are not permitted to straggle, or to plunder the baggage of the officers and soldiers. 
</p><p>
The greatest harmony having hitherto subsisted between the French and American soldiers, your Lordship will be particularly careful to see that it is not interrupted by any act of imprudence on our part ; and, as 
Baron Viomenil, who will command the French line, is older in commission than your Lordship, you will take the parole and countersign from him daily. It is 
scarcely probable that the enemy will make any attempt upon the camp, while so respectable a force is near their own lines. Should they do it, it must be by water. The officer commanding the water-guard will 
communicate anv movement to Colonel Greaton at Dobbs's Ferry, who will give immediate intelligence to you, which you will of course transmit to Baron 
Viomenil. The party at Dobbs's Ferry being for the purpose of erecting a work there, they are not to be withdrawn for camp duties. I am, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The moving state in which the army was at the time your letter of the 12th ultimo came to hand, the junction of the alhed troops at that period, and a variety 
of matters which have occurred since the junction, and consequent thereon, rather than a disinclination to continue a correspondence, the benefits of which were in 
my favor, must plead as an excuse for my silence till 
now. Unconscious of having given you just cause to 
change the favorable sentiments you have expressed for 
me, I could not suppose an alteration on your part; 
and, as I never suffer reports, unsupported by proofs, 
to have weight in my mind, I know no reason why our 
correspondence should cease, or become less frequent 
than heretofore, excepting on my part, that, as our affairs get more or less involved in perplexity, my attention is proportionably engaged, and more or less leisure is allowed for indulgences. 
</p><p>
That we have hail a very cDinpeteiit portion, and a great variety of difficulties of late, a person, so well informed of public matters as you are, needs not be told. 
The distresses of Virginia I am but too well acquainted with ; but the plan you have suggested as a relief for 
it is, in my judgment, a greater proof of your unbounded confidence in me, than it is, that your means proposed would be found adequate to the end in view, 
were it practicable to make the experiment, which at present it is not, as there are insuperable obstacles to my removing from the immediate command of the auxiliary troops. 
</p><p>
The reasons for this opinion I cannot commit to paper, at all times liable to miscarriage, but peculiarly so of late. I am fully persuaded, however, and upon good 
military principles, that the measures I have adopted will give more effectual and speedy relief to the State 
of Virginia, than my marching thither with dictatorial powers, at the head of every man I could draw from 
hence, without leaving the important posts on the North 
River quite defenceless, and these States open to devastation and ruin. When I say this, I would be understood to mean, if I am properly supported by the 
States eastward of Jersey inclusive. My present plan 
of operation, which I have been preparing with all the 
zeal and activity in my power, will, I am morally certain, with proper support produce one of two things ; 
either the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, or a withdrawal of the 
troops from Virginia, excepting a garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, at which place, I have no doubt of the enemy's 
intention of establishing a permanent post. A long 
land march, in which we have never failed to dissipate 
half of our men, the difficulty and expense of transportation, and other reasons not less powerful, but 
which I dare not commit to writing, decided me in 
my present plan ; and my hopes, I trust, will not be 
disappointed. 
</p><p>
In half an hour's conversation I could, I think, convince you of the utility of my plan ; but, as I have 
before observed, I do not attempt it by letter, because 
I have already had two important ones intercepted in 
the mails, the sight of which, I am persuaded, occasioned the retrograde movements of Lord Cornwallis, and 
will be the means of bringing a part of his force to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to the accomplishment of one part of my 
expectation. 
</p><p>
No endeavours of mine have been wanting to obtain a naval superiority in these seas, nor to employ 
that which we have to valuable purposes. How far I 
have succeeded in the latter is but too obvious ; how 
far I may see my wishes accomplished in the former, 
time must discover. With great esteem and regard, 
I am, dear Sir, &c.

I have been honored with your Excellency's favor of the l.'jth instant. I have no doubt but the reasons which induce you to decline the removal of the squadron under your command to the Chesapeake at this 
time are founded in propriety ; but I am certain, that, 
could the measure have taken place, it would have 
been attended with most valuable consequences, more 
especially as, from reports and appearances, the enemy are about to bring part of their troops from Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Although the detachments from 
your fleet under the command of the Baron d'Angely

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have been honored with your favor of the 10th, announcing your resignation of the chair of Congress 
and the election of Mr. McKean to that important station. I flattered myself with the hope of an opportunity of personally acknowledging the attentions, which 
I received from you during your presidency ; but as I 
find you could not with convenience make a visit to 
the army on your way home, I am constrained to 
take this method of returning my thanks and expressing my sincere wishes for the re-establishment of your 
health. I am exceedingly happy to hear, that our political affairs begin to assume a new and pleasing appearance, which, if continued, will I hope have an influence upon the military. That department is yet 
laboring under every difficulty and distress, and there 
seems to me little chance of its being relieved from 
the debility to which it is reduced ; for, notwithstanding my pressing requisitions, and the more pressing 
occasion which there is for recruits at this moment, I 
may almost say I have not received one man since 
my last demand. 
</p><p>
The station, which you have lately filled -with so 
much honor, has given you an opportunity of making 
yourself intimately acquainted with our real situation ; 
and a representation from you to your State will naturally have more weight, than that of a stranger to public affairs. Be assured. Sir, you cannot employ your 
time better at home, than in constantly impressing all 
ranks with the necessity of recruiting and supplying 
the army. I have the honor to be, &c.

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
With peculiar satisfaction I do myself the honor to 
acknowledge the receipt of your several favors, and to 
assure you at the same time, that it is with the warmest pleasure I express my full approbation of the various movements and operations, which your military 
conduct has lately exhibited; while I confess to you 
that I am unable to conceive what more could have 
been done under your circumstances, than has been 
displayed by your little persevering and determined 
army. Lord Rawdon's reinforcement from England 
was a most untoward circumstance ; but even this, I 
hope, will soon be surmounted by your good fortune. 
</p><p>
You will be informed from the Marquis, of every 
circumstance that has taken place in Virginia. A detachment from the army of this brave and fortunate 
young nobleman will, I hope, soon arrive to your assistance in Carolina. 
</p><p>
By our movements in this quarter, and the main army taking a position near <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and making every 
preparation for a serious attempt upon that place, we 
have already produced a happy effect, that of a withdrawal of a considerable part of the troops under the 
command of Lord Cornwallis as a reinforcement to 
their garrison, which has been some time past closely 
confined to York Island. This withdrawal will probably disappoint their views of conquest in Virginia, and 
will exceedingly embarrass the prospects of the British 
ministry in the proposed treaty to be opened at Vienna. This is a very great object, even should any thing prevent our obtaining further success in our operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
The operating force of the enemy in the southern States being confined in all probability to South Carolina, will leave the other States in a condition to afford 
you such succours as, with the aid of the Marquis's detachment, will, I trust, enable you to fulfil your hopes and wishes in their utmost extent in your command. 
Should this event take place, you may be assured, that, added to the honor that will be thereby reflected on 
your own person, it will afford me the highest satisfaction. I sincerely wish we had the means of communicating more frequently with each other. Be assured. 
Sir, my concern for your honor and welfare interests me most particularly in every event which attends you. 
</p><p>
A reason, which cannot at this time be communicated, induces me to request that you will be pleased 
to give me the earliest and most minute information 
of every event, that takes place with you, and a circumstantial detail of the present situation of the State of 
South Carolina, its strength and operative force, with 
its resources for the support of an army, and the extent of those resources, with the places where they 
may be collected and secured ; also the strength, position, and circumstances attending the enemy's force. 
I have the honor to be, etc.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favors of the 8th and 20th instant. The first relieved me from much anxiety, as I had seen Mr. Rivington's account 
of the action at Green Spring, which you may suppose was highly colored in their favor. You ask my opinion of the Virginia campaign. Be assured, my dear 
Marquis, your conduct meets my warmest approbation, as it must that of every body. Should it ever be said, 
that my attachment to you betrayed me into partiality, you have only to appeal to facts to refute any such charge. But I trust there will be no occasion.
</p><p>
Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='co-worker met'>Colonel Hamilton</a> will join the advanced corps under the orders of Colonel Scammell 
</p><p>
I very much approve of your intention of reinforcing <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, as soon as circumstances will allow, and as strongly as possible. 11' he can only maintain 
the advantages he has already gained in the Carolinas and Georgia, the British ministry will make a very diligent figure in the political scene from that, which it is plain they expected, by Lord George Germain's letters of March last. 
</p><p>
Private Letter, July 30th. — T take your private 
letter of the 20th in the light which you wish it, that 
of an unreserved communication from one friend to 
another ; and I should be wanting in candor, were I 
not to expose my sentiments to you in as free a manner. I am convinced, that your desire to be with 
this army arises principally from a wish to be actively 
useful. You will not, therefore, regret your stay in 
Virginia until matters are reduced to a greater degree 
of certainty, than they are at present, especially when 
I tell you, that, from the change of circumstances 
with which the removal of part of the enemy's force 
from Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will be attended, it is more than probable, that we shall also entirely change our plan of operations. I think we have already effected one part of the plan of the campaign settled at 
Weathersfield ; that is, giving a substantial relief to the 
southern States, by obliging the enemy to recall a considerable part of their force from thence. Our views 
must now be turned towards endeavouring to expel 
them totally from those States, if we find ourselves 
incompetent to the siege of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. The difficulty 
of doing this does not so much depend upon obtaining a force capable of effecting it, as upon the mode 
of collecting that force to the proper point, and transporting the provisions and stores necessary for such 
an operation. You are fully acquainted with the almost impracticability of doing this by land ; to say nothing of the amazing loss of men always occasioned 
by long marches, and those towards a quarter in which 
the service is disagreeable. I should not, however, 
hesitate to encounter these difficulties, great as they 
are, had we not prospects of transporting ourselves in 
a manner safe, easy, and expeditious. Your penetration will point out my meaning, which I cannot venture to express in direct terms. 
</p><p>
I approve of your resolution to reinforce <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, in proportion to the detachment which the 
enemy may make to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. Let your next attention be paid to training and forming the militia, with 
which you may be furnished, and disposing of them in 
such a manner, that they may be drawn at the shortest notice to whatever point the enemy may make 
their capital post, which I conclude will be at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. The establishment of magazines at safe deposits will be in all cases necessary ; but, above all things, 
I recommend an aiigmciitatit)ii of your cavalry to 
as great an extent as possible. It may happen, that 
the enemy may be driven to the necessity of forcing 
their way through North Carolina to avoid a greater 
misfortune. A superiority of horse on our side would 
be fatal to them in such a case. 
</p><p>
The advantages resulting from a move of the French fleet from Newport to the Chesapeake were carefully and strongly pointed out to Count de Barras, and I thought he had once agreed to put it in execution ; but, by 
his late letters, he seemed to think that such a manoeuvre might interfere with greater plans, and therefore he declined it. It would now be too late to answer the principal object, as, by accounts from a deserter, the troops arrived from Virginia last Friday. 
</p><p>
Should your return to this army be formally determined upon, I cannot flatter you with a command equal to your expectations or my wishes. You know 
the over proportion of general officers to our numbers, and can therefore conceive where the difficulty will be. <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='co-worker'>General McDougall</a> is not yet provided for, and the 
Jersey anti York troops are reserved for him. They are promised to him, though they have not yet joined. 
</p><p>
In my letter to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, which I beg the 
favor of you to forward, I have hinted nothing of 
what I have said to you, for fear of miscarriage. You 
will probably find a safe opportunity from your army 
to him, and you will oblige me by communicating the 
part of this letter, which relates to my expectation of 
being able to transport part of the army to the southward, should the operation against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> be declined. 
</p><p>
I wish, as I mentioned in my last, to send a confidential person to you to explain at large what I 
have so distantly hinted ; but I am really at a loss, on 
account of not knowing the officers better, to find one 
upon whose discretion I can depend. My own family, 
you know, are constantly and fully employed. I hope, 
however, that I have spoken plain enough to be understood by you. With every sentiment of affection 
and regard, I am, &,c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The expectation of the pleasure of seeing you has 
prevented me hitherto from making a communication 
of a most important and interesting nature. But circumstances will not admit of further delay, and I must 
trust it to paper. It seems reduced almost to a certainty, that the enemy will reinforce <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> with 
part of their troops from Virginia. In that case, the attempt against the former must be laid aside, as it will 
not be in our power to draw together a force sufficient 
to justify the undertaking. The detachment, which the 
enemy will probably leave in Virginia, seems the next 
object which ought to engage our attention, and which 
will be a very practicable one, should we obtain a naval 
superiority, of which I am not without hopes, and be 
able to carry a body of men suddenly round by water. 
The principal difficulty, which occurs, is obtaining transports at the moment they may be wanted ; for, if they 
are taken up beforehand, the use for which they are 
designed cannot be concealed, and the enemy will 
make arrangements to defeat the plan. 
</p><p>
What I would wish you to inform yourself of, therefore, without making a direct inquiry, is what number 
of tons of shipping could be obtained in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> 
at any time between this and the 20th of this month, 
and whether there could also be obtained at the same 
time a few deep-waisted sloops and schooners proper 
to carry horses. The number of double-decked vessels, which may be wanted, of two hundred tons and upwards, will not exceed thirty, I shall be glad of 
your answer as soon as possible, because, if it is favorable, I can direct certain preparations to be made in 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and at other convenient places, without 
incurring any suspicions. There certainly can be no 
danger of not obtaining flour in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> ; and as 
you seem to have doubts of procuring salt meat there, 
I shall direct all that is at the eastward to be collected 
at places from whence it may be shipped upon the 
shortest notice. You will also oblige me by giving me 
your opinion of the number of vessels, which might 
be obtained at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>, or other places in the Chesapeake, in the time before mentioned or thereabouts.

Sir,
</p><p>
I regret being obliged to inform your Excellency, that I find myself at this late period very little stronger than I was when the army first moved out of their 
quarters. I leave your Excellency to judge of the delicate and embarrassed situation in which I stand at 
this moment. Unable to advance with prudence beyond my present position, while perhaps in the general 
opinion my force is equal to the commencement of operations against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, my conduct must appear, if not Ijlamable, highly mysterious at least. Our allies, 
with whom a junction has been formed upwards of three weeks, and who were made to expect, from the engagements which I entered into with them at Weathersfield in May last, a very considerable augmentation 
of our force by this time, instead of seeing a prospect 
of advancing, must conjecture, upon good grounds, that 
the campaign will waste fruitlessly away. I shall just 
remark, that it will be no small degree of triumph to 
our enemies, and will have a very pernicious influence 
upon our friends in Europe, should they find such a failure of resource, or such a want of energy to draw It out, that our boasted and expensive preparations end only in idle parade. 
</p><p>
I cannot yet but persuade myself, and I do not 
cease to encourage our allies with the hope, that our 
force will still be sufficient to carry our intended operation into effect ; or, if we cannot fully accomplish 
that, to oblige the enemy to withdraw part of their force 
from the southward to support <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which, as I 
informed you in my letter from Weathersfield, was part 
of our plan. Your Excellency must be sensible, that 
the fulfilment of my engagements must depend upon 
the degree of vigor, with which the executives of the 
several States exercise the powers with which they 
have been vested, and enforce the laws lately passed 
for filling up and supplying the army. In full confidence that the means, which have been voted, will be 
obtained, I shall continue my preparations ; but I must take the liberty of informing you, that it is essentially necessary I should be made acquainted, immediately 
upon the receipt of this, with the number of Continental levies and militia, that have been forwarded, and 
what are the prospects of obtaining the remainder. I will t'lirthcr ackl, that it will be equally necessary to see that the monthly i|Ui)ta of provision, stipulated at the 
meeting of the connnissioners at <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, is regularly complied with. I have the honor to be, &,c.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
I have received your letters of the 26th and 30th 
ultimo and 1st instant. I cannot learn that any troops 
have yet arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> from Virginia. A fleet 
of twenty sail came in last Saturday with troops, but 
they are said to be Hessian recruits from Europe. The 
<a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>e frigate has arrived at Newport from Count de Gitisse. He was to leave St. Domingo the 3d of this 
month, with a fleet of between twenty- five and twenty-nine sail of the line, and a considerable body of land 
forces. His destination is immediately for the Chesapeake ; so that he will either be there by the time this 
reaches you, or you may look for him every moment. 
Under these circumstances, whether the enemy remain 
in full force, or whether they have only a detachment 
left, you will immediately take such a position as will 
best enable you to prevent their sudden retreat through 
North Carolina, which I presume they will attempt 
the instant they perceive so formidable an armament. 
Should <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='co-worker'>General Wayne</a>, with the troops destined for 
South Carolina, still remain in the neighbourhood of 
James River, and should the enemy have made no detachment to the southward, you will detain those troops 
until you hear from me again, and inform <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a> of the cause of their delay. If Wayne should 
have marched, and should have gained any considerable distance, I would not have him halted. 
</p><p>
You shall hear further from me as soon as I have 
concerted plans and formed dispositions for sending a 
reinforcement from hence. In the mean time, I have 
only to recommend a continuation of that prudence 
and good conduct, which you have manifested through 
the whole of your campaign. You will be particularly 
careful to conceal the expected arrival of the Count; 
because, if the enemy are not apprized of it, they will 
stay on board their transports in the Bay, which will 
be the luckiest circumstance in the world. You will 
take measures for opening a communication with Count de Grasse the moment he arrives, and will concert 
measures with him for making the best use of your 
joint forces until you receive aid from this quarter. I 
would not wish you to call out a large body of militia upon this occasion, but rather keep those you have 
compact and ready for service. I am, &c.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have only time to acknowledge the receipt of your Honor of the 8th instant and to congratulate you on your fortunate escape ; which is attended with the more 
flattering circumstances, from its being effected entirely by your own presence of mind. As the remaining part of Colonel Cortlandt's regiment is now ordered to 
join the main army, I have given directions to <a href='/results.php?tla=jac' rel='co-worker'>General Clinton</a> to leave with you a small guard of men, 
who are the least capable of active service. The commissary will have orders to replace the rum, which you 
have borrowed for the public service, as soon as our 
circumstances will conveniently admit. At present 
there is not enough to satisfy the most pressing necessities of the service. With great respect and esteem, I have the honor to be, &c.

</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
In consequence of the despatches received from your 
Excellency by the frigate <a href='/results.php?city=concord' rel='city'>Concord</a>e, it has been judged 
expedient to give up for the present the enterprise 
against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and turn our attention towards the 
south, with a view, if we should not be able to attempt 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> itself, to recover and secure the States of 
Virginia, North Carolina, and the country of South 
Carolina and Georgia. We may add a further inducement for giving up the first-mentioned enterprise, which 
is the arrival of a reinforcement of near three thousand 
Hessian recruits. For this purpose we have determined to remove the whole of the French army, and 
as large a detachment of the American as can be 
spared, to the Chesapeake, to meet your Excellency 
there. 
</p><p>
The following appear to us the principle cases, which 
will present themselves, and upon which we shall be 
obliged ultimately to form our plans. We have therefore stated them with a few short observations upon 
each. Your Excellency will be pleased to revolve 
them in your mind, and prepare your opinion by the 
time we shall have the pleasure of meeting you in 
Virginia. 
</p><p>
First, What shall be done, if the enemy should be 
found with the greater part of their force in Virginia, 
upon the arrival of the French fleet I Secondly, What 
shall be done, if a detachment only shall be found 
there? Thirdly, What shall be done, if the British 
force be totally withdrawn from thence? 
</p><p>
As to the first, it appears to us, that we ought, without loss of time, to attack the enemy with our united 
force. 
</p><p>
As to the second, it appears proper to destine such part of our force as will be amply sufficient to reduce 
the enemy's detachment, and then determine what use 
shall be made of the remainder. And here two things 
present themselves for our consideration. The enemy 
will either have sent the greater part of their force from 
Virginia to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> or to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. If to New 
York, (which is the least probable under present circumstances,) <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> will have but a moderate garrison, and it may be possible to attack it to advantage. 
If to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, then the enemy will be so superior to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='co-worker met'>General Greene</a>, that they will be able to regain the 
whole of the State of South Carolina, and of consequence Georgia. We therefore think, that, in this latter 
case, such a force at least should be detached to South 
Carolina, as will enable us to keep the field and confine the enemy in or near <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>. 
</p><p>
In the third case we mean, that, supposing the enemy 
should have totally evacuated Virginia, it appears to us necessary to make a solid establishment at <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, 
or any other place if more proper, in order to render 
a fleet in the Chesapeake Bay entirely secure, and to 
employ the remainder of our land force and such vessels as may be proper for the service, as has been explained in the preceding article ; that is, either in the 
siege of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, if the garrison shall be found sufficient to warrant the attempt, or to cover and secure 
the country, should it be found otherwise. 
</p><p>
Returning to the enterprise against <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> will 
depend on a number of circumstances, the discussion 
of which we will leave until we have the happiness of 
a conference with your Excellency. We have only to 
observe, that the execution of all or any of the plans, 
which we have proposed, goes upon the supposition of a 
decided naval superiority; except that of marching a 
reinforcement into South Carolina. 
</p><p>
We would beg leave to take up so much of your 
time, as to point out to you the vast importance of 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, and what advantages the enemy derive from 
the possession of it. It is the centre of their power in 
the south. By holding it they preserve a dangerous influence throughout the whole State, as it is the only 
port, and the only place from whence the people can 
procure those articles of foreign produce, which are essential to their support ; and it in a great measure 
serves to cover and keep in subjection the State of 
Georgia. From thence the enemy can also establish 
small posts in North Carolina ; and, if they maintain a post in the Chesapeake, they keep up the appearance 
of possessing four hundred miles upon the coast, and of consequence have a pretext for setting up claims, which may be very detrimental to the interests of America in European councils. 
</p><p>
We are not sufficiently acquainted with the position of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> (neither is it necessary at this time) to enter into a detail of the proper mode of attacking it, 
or of the probability which we should have of succeeding. For these we will refer you to Brigadier-General Duportail, commander of the corps of engineers in the 
service of the United Slates, who will have the honor 
of presenting this. That gentleman, having been in 
<a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> as principal engineer during the greater part 
of the siege, and in the environs of it as a prisoner of 
war a considerable time afterwards, had opportunities 
of making very full observations, which he judiciously improved. 
</p><p>
A variety of cases, different from those we have 
stated, may occur. It is for this reason we have 
thought proper to send General Duportail to your Excellency. He is fully acquainted with every circumstance of our affairs in this quarter, and we recommend him to you as an officer, in whose abilities and 
in w hose integrity you may place the fullest confidence. We would observe, that it will lie very essential to the despatch of the business in contemplation, for you to send up the Elk River, at the head of 
the Chesapeake Bay, all your frigates, transports, and 
vessels proper for the conveyance of the French and 
American troops down the bay. We shall endeavour 
to have as many as can be found in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and 
other ports secured, but we have reason to believe 
they will be very few. We have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, attachment, esteem, &,c.

</p><p>
Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have in confidence imparted to you the alteration of our late plan, and made you acquainted with our intended operations. Besides the provision necessary at 
the Head of Elk to carry the troops down the bay, a very considerable quantity will be wanted in Virginia. I should suppose three hundred barrels of flour, as 
many of salt meat, and ci2;ht or ten lioj^jslieacls of rum would be sufficient at Elk. For what will be consumed in Virginia, I imagine the order must be general, as we can neither ascertain the number of men, 
who will he drawn together, or the time they will be employed. 
</p><p>
I have written to the Count de Grasse, and have requested him to send up his light vessels of every kind 
to Elk ; but I would  nevertheless wish to have all that 
may be at <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and the upper parts of the bay 
secured. I shall therefore be obliged to you to take 
measures at a proper time for that purpose. When 
that time will be, and when you shall give orders for 
the deposit at Elk, I will hereafter inform you. I shall direct the quartermaster in due season to take up all the small craft in the Delaware for the purpose of 
transporting the troops from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a> to Christiana. Should he have occasion for advice or assistance from you upon this occasion, I must request you to give 
him both. I am confident it will be necessary to give the American troops, destined for southern services, one month's pay in specie. This will amount to about 
dollars. If it will be possible for you to procure this sum, you will infinitely oblige me and will much benefit the service. I shall also stand in need of a sum of specie for secret services, I suppose about 
five hundred guineas. I am, dear Sir, &c.

<p>
Instructions. 
</p><p>
Sir, 
</p><p>
You are to take the command of all the troops remaining in this department, consisting of the two regiments of New Hampshire, ten of Massachusetts, and 
five of Connecticut infantry, the corps of invalids, Sheldon's legion, the third regiment of artillery, together with all such State troops and militia, as are retained in service, and who would have been under my own command. 
</p><p>
The security of <a href='/results.php?city=west point' rel='city'>West Point</a> and the posts in the Highlands is to be considered the first object of your attention. In order to effect this, you will make such dispositions as in your judgement the circumstances shall 
from time to time require ; taking care to have as large a supply of salted provisions as possible constantly on hand ; to have the fortifications, works, and magazines 
repaired and perfected as far as may be ; to have the garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present strength ; and to have the minuter arrangements and plans for the defence and support of this important post 
perfectly understood and vigorously acted upon, in case of any attempt against it. Ample magazines of wood and forage are to be laid in against the approaching winter. The former should be cut on the margin of 
the river, and transported by water to the garrison. The latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines, in the greatest quantities possible, and 
deposited in such places as you shall judge proper. 
</p><p>
The force now put under your orders, it is presumed, 
will be sufficient for all the purposes above mentioned ; 
as well as to yield a very considerable protection and 
cover to the country, without hazarding the safety of 
the posts in the Highlands. This is to be esteemed, 
as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of 
the country, an extremely interesting object ; but, when 
compared with the former, of a secondary nature. The 
protection of the northern and western frontiers of the 
State of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as well as those parts of that and 
other States most contiguous and exposed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy, will claim your 
attention. But, as the contingencies, which are to be 
expected in the course of the campaign, may be so 
various, unforeseen, and almost infinite, that no particular line of conduct can be prescribed for them, upon 
all such occasions you will be governed by your own 
prudence and discretion, in which the fullest confidence 
is placed. 
</p><p>
Although your general rule of conduct will be to act 
on the defensive only, yet it is not meant to prohibit 
you from striking a blow at the enemy's posts, or detachments, should a fair opportunity present itself. 
</p><p>
The most eligible position for your army, in my opinion, will be on the north side of Croton River ; as 
well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of West 
Point, annoying the enemy, and covering the country, 
as for the security and repose of your troops, Waterbury's brigade, which may be posted towards the 
Sound, Sheldon's corps, the State troops of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
and other light parties, may occasionally be made use 
of to hold the enemy in check, and carry on a petite 
guerre with them ; but I would recommend keeping 
your force as much collected and as compact as the 
nature of the service will admit, doing duty by corps 
instead of detachments whenever it is practicable, and 
above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assiduously, while the troops are in a camp of repose, to 
make them perfect in their exercise and manoeuvres, 
and to establish the most regular system of discipline 
and duty. The good of the service and the emulation 
of corps will, I am persuaded, prompt the officers and 
men to devote their whole time and attention to the 
pleasing and honorable task of becoming masters of 
their profession. The uncertainty, which the present 
movements of the army will probably occasion with the 
enemy, ought to be increased by every means in your 
power, and the deception kept up as long as possible. 
</p><p>
It will not be expedient to prevent such militia as were ordered from coming in, until the arrival of the Count de Grasse, or something definite or certain is 
known from the southward ; and even then (but of this you will be advised) circumstances may render it 
advisable to keep the enemy at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> in check, to prevent their detaching to reinforce their southern army, or to harass the inhabitants on the seacoast. 
</p><p>
The redoubt on the east side of Dobbs's Ferry is to be dismantled and demolished, and the platforms to be 
taken up and transported up the river, if it can conveniently be done. The blockhouse on the other side is to be maintained, or evacuated and destroyed, as you 
shall think proper. The water-guards and other precautions to prevent a surprise, you will be pleased to take into consideration, and regulate in such a manner 
as you shall judge most expedient. You will be pleased, also, to keep me regularly advised of every important event, which shall take place in your department.

Sir, 
</p><p>
I have this moment the honor of your letter by Monsieur Blanchard. I am very sorry for the difficulties 
and impediments, which fall in the way of your march, 
and hope they will decrease as you proceed. I have 
the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that my troops 
arrived at the Ferry yesterday, and began to pass the 
river at ten o'clock in the morning, and by sunrise of 
this day they were all completely on this side of the 
river. I hope your army will be enabled to cross with 
the same facility when they arrive. 
</p><p>
I have no news worthy of communicating from any 
quarter. I shall be happy in your company to-morrow 
at dinner at my quarters, and will meet you at the 
ferry to-morrow by eight o'clock, when we will either 
be furnished with some cold repast en passant, or I will 
take you to my quarters about three miles from the 
Ferry, where you shall be introduced to a warm breakfast. I have the honor to be, &c.

My dear Marquis, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to my intentions communicated to you on 
the 15th instant, the troops destined for the southern 
quarter are now in motion. The American detachment 
is already on the west side of the Hudson. The French 
army I expect will reach the Ferry this day. Our 
march will be continued with all the despatch that 
our circumstances will admit. As it will be of great 
importance towards the success of our present enterprise, that the enemy on the arrival of the fleet should 
not have it in their power to effect their retreat, I cannot omit to repeat to you my most earnest wish, that 
the land and naval forces, which you will have with 
you, may so combine their operations, that the British 
army may not be able to escape. The particular mode 
of doing this I shall not at this distance attempt to 
dictate. Your own knowledge of the country, from 
your long continuance in it, and the various and extended movements, which you have made, have given 
you great opportunities for observation ; of which I am persuaded your military genius and judgment will leave you to make the best improvement. You will, 
my dear Marquis, keep me constantly advised of every important event respecting the enemy or yourself. 
</p><p>
I am. Sec. 
</p><p>
P. S. The enclosed for the Count de Grasse is 
left open for your observation, and committed to your 
care for its safe conveyance. If any water-craft can 
be procured in the country where you are, you will 
be pleased to have them sent to the Head of Elk by 
the 8th of September, to facilitate the embarkation of 
the troops who will be there by that day.
