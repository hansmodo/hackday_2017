DEAR SIR: I have received and read the President's Message with deep mortification and concern; but the 
letter annexed to it, stated to be a communication in cyphers from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> to Gen. Wilkinson, excites my 
unfeigned astonishment. I solemnly avow that, when that letter was written, I had never heard, directly or 
indirectly, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a>, or any other person, of the 
meditated attack on New Orleans ; nor had I any more reason to suspect an attack on that place, or any other 
part of the United States, than I have* at this moment to suspect that our militia will be forthwith ordered on an 
expedition against Gibraltar. On the other hand, I had long had strong grounds for believing that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> was engaged by other objects, of a very different nature from 
those attributed to him, and which I confess the best sentiments of my heart approved. I need not add that 
those objects involved not the interests of my country. Without adverting to that integrity of principle, which 
even my enemies, I trust, have allowed me, can it be supposed that a man situated as I am descended from a 
family which has never known dishonor, happy in the affection and esteem of a large number of relations and 
friends, possessed of ample fortune, and standing high in the confidence of his fellow-citizens could harbor, for an 
instant, a thought injurious to the country which was the scene of those blessings? The supposition would be 
monstrous. No, sir ; it was but a short period before the impression became general, that apprehended the possibility of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr's</a> intentions being hostile to the Union ; and the moment which gave birth to that apprehension, 
gave birth to the resolution which became a citizen. I confess, however, there are times even now, when, in 
spite of the strong facts which have been exhibited, I am almost inclined to believe my suspicions injurious. What 
ever may be thought of the heart of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Mr. Burr</a>, his talents 
are great beyond question, and to reconcile with such talents, the chimerical project of dismembering the 
Union, or wresting from it any part of its Territory, is difficult indeed. I traveled through a part of the western 
country, during the last summer, and have no hesitation in saying, that either of those projects would have been 
as much reprobated there as in the Atlantic States. "With respect, however, to the communication annexed to the 
President's Message, which occasions you the trouble of this letter : after my solemn assurances to you that I had 
never given <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a>, or any other person, the smallest 
reason to imagine that I could be induced to engage in any project against my country, it would be infinitely 
satisfactory to me, could I explain to you, with the same certainty, the motive which led him to introduce my name 
as he did. But here, unfortunately, all is conjecture. Two motives only suggest themselves. He imagined, 
perhaps which, by the way, he has no right to do that his influence would be sufficiently great to induce my 
assent, and thought, therefore, he might as well consider it already obtained ; or, which is more probable, he might 
have imagined, that by the apparent concert of a number of persons from different States, a stronger impression would 
be made on his correspondent. Considerable effect, too, was, no doubt, anticipated by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr's</a> discernment from the perfect self-confidence which would have been manifested 
by his taking with him his daughter, receiving my co operation, and thus embarking in the scheme the fortunes 
of his infant grandson, the only relative, except his daughter, that he has. But whatever the motive which 
drew from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a> the expressions contained in this 
letter to Gen. "Wilkinson, facts, incontrovertible facts, prove that he had no authority for making them. His daughter 
did not go with him; the navy of the United States is still faithful to its duty ; Commodore Truxton, I am told, at 
the very moment he was said to have gone to the West Indies, was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, which I know not whether he has ever left ; and I, instead of following with a corps 
of worthies, am now at my usual residence, where I have been ever since the adjournment of the Legislature, peaceably 
directing the plowing of my rice-fields, and preparing my lands for the ensuing crop. This is conclusive. A 
conspirator against the happiness and liberties of his country would have been, at this moment, very differently employed. Conspirator! the blood now burns my cheek, as I write the word. But I meant to confine 
myself simply to the disavowal I have made you, of a single action or word hostile to my country. To feel 
even that disavowal necessary is sufficiently painful : I have yielded, however, to circumstances, and made it. 
My unequivocal manner of making it, I trust, will not leave a doubt upon one candid or honest mind. Still I 
am aware that the common interchange of good offices with a man with whom I have been kmg nearly connected, may have given rise to circumstances which, 
however innocent in themselves, malignity will delight in distorting, and the illiberal among my political adversaries exult in disseminating. I am aware that there will be men base enough ; for you and I have, not long since, 
seen proofs of it, to whisper even the circumstance of my connection, by marriage, with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a>, as a circumstance warranting suspicion. About the opinions of such men I am indifferent. To the more ingenious and better 
part of my fellow-citizens, of whatever sect or party, I can only solemnly repeat, as I have done to you, sooner 
would I have perished than harbored a thought subversive of the liberties, the happiness, or the integrality of 
my country. Let me always be judged by my own acts, and I shall be satisfied. If Mr. Jefferson or Gen. Wilkinson ever find any thing to urge against me, let it be 
adduced. My residence is well known, and I shall never shrink from investigation. Nay more, presumption, where 
I can not repel it by positive proof, shall be received as good evidence, and the slightest suspicion which I can not satisfactorily explain, shall be admitted as guilt. 
</p><p>
I remain, my dear sir, with much respect and regard. 
</p><p>
Yours always, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="me">JOSEPH ALSTON</a>.

DEAR SIR : You perceive, from the very first word I have written, that I address you with the same feelings 
with which we parted. There are certain expressions in your letter of April last, which, if you recollect, you must 
acknowledge, are not calculated to conciliate : they spring, however, so manifestly from a zealous attachment to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a>, and a misapprehension of my feelings, that they 
have produced none of those sensations which, under different circumstances, they would not fail to excite. I 
pass them over, too, the more readily, as I am persuaded from your temper, the moment of discovering your error 
will be the moment of regret at having indulged it. Suffer me then to assure you, I have inflicted none of 
those wounds upon my " friends or relatives " which you apprehend. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> feels that he has not the smallest grounds of resentment against me ; he is perfectly satisfied ; nor does there exist a shadow of that animosity 
between us that you deprecate. The fact is, from not having a view of the whole ground, you have judged 
precipitately and erroneously of my error, in giving faith to the letter attributed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> by Gen. Wilkinson, 
I have long been satisfied from several quarters. Nothing but the shape, apparently so unquestionable, in which 
it came, could have gained it credit with me, for a moment. These things, however, will shortly be put to 
rights. As soon as the trial, now pending at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
is over, the event of which, I am persuaded, can not but be favorable, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> will be with us. A letter from him, of the 12th instant, announces health, spirits and 
confidence. Your letter was received the beginning of the present month, and, but for the necessity of ascertaining the intentions of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> upon the subject of it, 
should have been acknowledged immediately. I forwarded it to him directly, and have just heard from him. 
He informs me that the bill-holders have instituted no suit against you, but are at present expecting payment 
from him; that he has hopes of shortly effecting an arrangement by which he shall be able to meet the bills 
himself, which will, of course, relieve you, and render a reference to me unnecessary. He adds, that a gentleman, 
as agent for him, was to set out in a few days for the western country, through whom you should hear further 
and more amply upon the subject. These expectations of Col. B., I trust, will be accomplished. I have this day 
written to him, making certain offers which, I hope, will facilitate them ; but should they unfortunately fail, I shall 
certainly consider myself bound, both in honor and justice, to fulfill my engagement to you. The total 
failure of my crop, caused by the storm of last fall, has occasioned me a temporary embarrassment; but should 
your reimbursement devolve upon me, I shall cheerfully make any arrangement for a settlement which may prove 
satisfactory : the troubles and vexations you have under gone, the dreadful solicitudes and painful situation, so 
long endured by your amiable family, have my liveliest sympathies. The energy of mind, which distinguishes 
Mrs. Blennerhassett, has had a painfully ample field for exertion ; but the storm is past, and better moments, I 
trust, are about to arrive. Of the friendly attentions and unremitting hospitalities received from you during our 
tour through the western country, allow me to assure you of my grateful recollections. Were it within the scope 
of probabilities, I need not tell you how much pleasure the presence of yourself and family, at the Oaks, would 
give us. Tender, I pray you, to Mrs. Blennerhassett, my profound and most friendly respects. 
</p><p>
Believe me, with much esteem, your very obedient, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="me">JOSEPH ALSTON</a>.

</p><p>
P. S. Being unwell myself, Mrs. Alston has acted as my amanuensis. It is so customary at this time to publish extracts from every letter in which the name of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Col. Burr</a> happens to be mentioned, that I was about to 
observe to you, what you will readily perceive without the observation, that this is not meant for the same purpose, but merely for your own perusal. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="me">J. A.</a> 
</p><p>
Having acted as amanuensis for Mr. Alston, I now believe to speak for myself, and inquire after the health of 
Mrs. Blennerhassett ; her fortitude has, I hope, supported her through the troubles of the winter. May they be 
the last she has ever to encounter. I wrote to her last autumn, but I suppose my letter has not reached her. 
The fulfillment of our mutual promise of corresponding would afford me great pleasure ; for it will now be the 
only means of supporting a friendship, which I flatter myself commenced in conformity of sentiment and sincerity ; but whatever may be the length of our separation 
or discontinuance of intercourse, the happy days I spent on the Ohio, and the character of Mrs. B., will remain 
indelibly impressed on the mind of her friend and 
admirer. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="me">T. B. ALSTON</a>.
