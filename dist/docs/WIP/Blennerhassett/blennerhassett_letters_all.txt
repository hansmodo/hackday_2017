WOOD COURT-HOUSE, VA., 

December 9th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. 

JAMES BROWN, ESQ., 

DEAR SIR : On my arrival home yesterday evening, I 
received your two letters of the 13th and 18th August 
last, which have laid at the office here, I know not how 
long. By them I fear you have no effects of Harte's in 
your possession, as you do not mention the horses I un 
derstood, hy Mr. Shaw, he left with you, which, with the 
presumption I had requested you to indorse his drafts to 
an amount not exceeding a thousand or twelve hundred 
dollars, induced me, as I wrote you November 7th, from 
ISTew York, to risk the return of one of the drafts you 
indorsed for one thousand dollars. But your letters received here, have caused me the utmost concern, lest I 
should not be in time by to-morrow's post to advise Mr. 
Morton, as Mr. Clay has suggested, to arrest the draft be 
fore its return upon you, though I am persuaded my 
proteg has altered my figures, which, indeed, would make 
no difference to your disadvantage, if he had done so to 
the last dollar I am worth . Be the effect, therefore, what 
it may upon my property, your time and ingenuity might 
have been better spent than in justifying the steps you 
ha$ taken to accommodate Mr. Harte upon my recom 
mendation. 

I will only add, I shall take my chance of whatever in 
demnity you can procure for me, by an attachment of any 
property within your reach. That Harte still is the son 
of the man I expected, I have a letter from his father 
acknowledging, but declaratory of his having fully discarded him, long ago, and affording me no prospect of 
retribution. 

I should hope the pleasing intelligence I have fre 
quently had of Mr. John Clay's present good circum 
stances, may permit me to anticipate he will settle with 
me for the sale he made of a negro woman of mine, in 
Kentucky, through you. 

The hints you have given of the predilection you en 
tertain for your last chosen meridian, have kindled in 
our minds a fire of enthusiastic curiosity, which our present embarrassments will constantly fan, until your details 
shall extinguish it with a faithful muster of the fogs and musquitoes of the Mississippi. 

But in sober sadness, I wish to learn with what capital, 
or in what speculation or profession, I could enjoy your 
neighborhood, when I can bid adieu to the spot on 
which I have so long hoped I should rest my bones for 
ever. I am inclined to hope my highly-valued friend, 
Woodbridge,* would accompany me, if he could see any 
mercantile prospects more inviting than this country 
affords. I have no doubt your friendship will find a moment of repose in your present cares of fame and fortune, 
in which I highly rejoice, to gratify mv expectation in 
this respect. 

Since I find you give us such just credit for the sentiments with which Mrs. Brown and yourself have inspired 
us, I will offer no repetition of them only a more possible prospect of personally testifying them, you may be 
sure, makes them more vivid, even in the abandonment 
of books and science, to which, I fear, the state of my 
affairs will henceforth, I know not how long, condemn me. 
Farewell ! dear Brown, and believe me always to be 
Your attached friend, 

H. BLENNERHASSETT.

COLONEL PHELPS: 

DEAR SIR : Just returned home, after a journey of 
seven hundred miles, I hasten to express to you the satis 
faction with which I learned, on the road, that you had 
been invested with the command of the two volunteer 
companies that had been raised in this country during my 
absence, as that circumstance afforded me a sure guaran 
tee against the idle reports I had heard, of any misguided 
violence intended by my neighbors against my family or 
property while I was not on the ground to defend them. 
But the information my wife has given me of the purport 
of the friendly message you sent her, at a time when you 
thought it would be expedient, has laid me under personal obligations to you, and rendered it a duty with me 
to endeavor to revive our former neighborly intercourse, 
especially at a season when so much misconception mis 
leads the people, propagated, as I have no doubt I can 
satisfy you, by your enemies and their own, when I shall 
have the pleasure of an hour's unreserved conversation 
with you, in which I expect I can make you some propositions that will engage your attention and be serviceable 
to jour best interests. I therefore embrace the earliest 
opportunity of soliciting an interview with you, and, in 
consideration of my fatigue, I take the liberty of requesting to see you this evening, and accept of a bed with us ; 
or if that should be inconvenient to you, I shall do my 
self the pleasure of attending any appointment you may 
designate for to-morrow. 

I am, dear sir, your obliged and obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

DEAR SIR : From circumstances of business, it was out 
of my power to attend at Col. Cushing's so early as my 
appointment. A short time after you left there I went 
over, and found your note requesting me to wait upon 
you this day. I am sorry that, from similar circum

be at home, I shall do myself the pleasure to wait upon 
you to-morrow.

DEAR SIR: Your favor, by Capt. Elliot, is duly re 
ceived, for which I thank you. My calculations have 
at all times been to leave Beaver on the first of next 
month. The only difficulty that I have to encounter is, 
the procuring the provisions necessary for my settlers, 
some of whom are behind, and I fear they will not arrive 
in time ; but I shall be off with the few that may happen 
to be with me, and trust to those behind t x o follow on. I 
shall also encourage some gentlemen to forward on flour, 
pork and whisky, with a promise that they may have 
their pay for them on the way. 

I have been unfortunate in having means furnished me 
equal to fulfilling contracts that might have been made 
for the article of whisky, in a particular manner, as the 
merchants are under the necessity of paying ready cash 
for it (they can not procure it on a credit). I expected 
Mr. Thompson or a Mr. Hopkins would have returned to 
me with some means, to enable me to make greater 
speed, but as they do not come, must suppose they have 
either not met with our friend, who is the principal agent 
in the purchases, or that the distance has been too far for 
them to return by this time. I think, however, that 
before you receive this, one of the men will be at Mari 
etta, on their way to me ; but be assured, that no time 
shall be lost on my part to be ready and on my way by 
the 1st; and by the 8th of the month, can, of course, 
be with you, or, at farthest, on that day. I shall, how 
ever, expect instructions through you, how and where I 
am to call, and of whom I may expect aid in any case : 
not being acquainted with any one, after I leave Beaver, 
I shall therefore expect some person to look for me, with 
your letter of introduction to me, with directions where 
I am to call on you. In the mean time, 

Believe me, dear sir, your faithful friend, 

COMFORT TYLER.

NOTE. THE FOLLOWING is A JOURNAL OF BLENNERHASSETT'S VOYAGE 
DOWN THE RIVER: 

16th December. Tuesday, we left Jeffersonville ; crossed the falls; 
nothing extra; all our boats crossed safe. 

ITih. Pursued our journey at twelve o'clock at night ; landed at Salt 
river ; took in seven hands ; stopped some time ; and started again at four 
o'clock in the morning. About ten o'clock, A. M., parted with Colonel 
Tyler, and four keel-boats left us. We had a very bad night, occasioned 
by heavy rain, which continued until morning. 
18th. Nothing remarkable; passed Anderson's river at thirty-five min 
utes past two o'clock, A. M. ; passed one of the keel-boats at twelve o'clock 
at night. 

19/A. Passed French Island at half-past nine, A. M. ; passed Green river 
at half-past eleven, A. M. About one, P. M., had some trouble about a canoe, 
which some of our hands, being ashore after wood, had taken away. The 
owner followed ; we had to pay him two dollars, and give up the canoe. 
Nothing more worth notice, until we arrived at Red Bank, then about sun 
down ; found it to be a place of small note ; there we remained two hours, 
and proceeding, passed Diamond Island about twelve o'clock at night. 

20th. About five, P. M., met with some difficulties among some sawyers, 
which is a term given by boatmen to old trees, which settle in the river, 
and which rise and fall by the rapidity of the current. They are often 
dangerous, and sometimes fatal. Immediately after disengaging our 
boats from the difficulty, we were prevented from proceeding by a ledge 
of rocks; with much hazard we cleared ourselves about seven; passed 
Highland Creek, where stands a town of small note, entirely inhabited 
by Roman Catholics. At half-past nine passed the Wabash river, came 
up with Colonel Tyler and his boats. In the forks of the Ohio and 
Wabash, stand a few houses, but of no consequence. The latter river 
here is of considerable magnitude, and runs into the Ohio, opposite the 
center of an island, which takes its name from the river. The Ohio, here, 
has a beautiful appearance, interspersed with handsome plantations along 
its banks. Four miles below the mouth of the Wabash, there is a large 
island, the name unknown to us. At half-past twelve, P. M., arrived at 
Shawneetown : this is a place of deposit for the salt, made at the saline, 
but of no other importance, being a place of no trade. 

2lst. Nothing remarkable. 

22d. Nothing in the course of the day, but had a very wet night. 

23rf. A beautiful day ; nothing extra. 

2th. Very windy ; repaired our boats, they being very leaky in the 
rbofs. At eleven o'clock, P.'M., an express arrived from Colonel Burr 
informing us of his intentions to meet us at Cumberland river; likewise 
orders for us to proceed; but we were prevented by high winds, BO 
remained that night. 

/////////
//2400
/////////

25th. Left Shawneetown at eight o'clock, A. M. ; the wind fresh and 
ahead. Passed an island, name unknown to us. This day the wind blew 
so hard, that our boats were totally separated ; with much difficulty our 
boat reached the Kentucky shore, after riding a tremendous swell; remained until sundown, and then proceeded on to join the rest of our 
company, who were in the same dilemma, being obliged to put in on the 
Indiana shore. 

26^. About five o'clock, A. M., one of Mr. Blennerhassett's boats joined 
us, being one of fifteen that were stopped at Marietta. At half-past seven 
o'clock passed the Rock and Cave; went ashore and viewed it; found no 
curiosities, more than a hollow cavern. Passed Hurricane Island and Creek 
at half-past ten o'clock; passed Clover Creek, eleven o'clock, on the In 
diana side ; passed the Copperas Banks at half-past three, P. M., Indiana 
shore. 

27th. Arrived at Cumberland river, at half-past , A. M.; joined 

Col. Burr, at the above place. The day was very stormy, and put our little fleet to considerable trouble. 

/////////
//2400
/////////

28th. This day a boat joined us from Cumberland river, with Cols. 
Burr, Harris, etc., on board. Pushed off on our journey, and landed on 
the Kentucky shore eight miles distant from the above place. In consequence of high winds, we landed about eight o'clock, P. M. 

2$th. This day pushed off at eight o'clock, A. M. ; wind ahead and 
strong; obliged to land immediately opposite the mouth of Tennessee 
river, where we lay by for several hours ; pushed off again at sundown, 
and passed Fort Massac at half-past eleven, P. M., and landed one mile 
below. 

30th. Pushed off at five o'clock, A. M. ; pleasant weather; came into 
the Mississippi at half-past three o'clock; passed the Iron Banks at halfpast eight o'clock, and passed the Chalk Banks at half-past nine, A. M. 

31st. Pleasant weather; nothing happened worth notice. Landed, at 
sundown, on the Louisiana shore. 

January 1st. This day landed at New Madrid, at nine o'clock, A. M.; 
remained about three hours, and left one of our hands, Major G. Wood, 
behind with a canoe, in order to engage some men that purposed coming 
on with us. This evening on coming ashore, owing to our being in rear 
of the fleet, and going after dark, our boat ran aground, but got off with 
some difficulty, and effected a good landing in a short time. 

2d. Pushed off this day at four o'clock, A. M.; passed the little prairie 
at eight o'clock ; fine weather ; landed at five o'clock at the Little Horse-shoe. 

3^ Pushed off this day about five, A. M. ; passed a number of islands ; 

saw no inhabitants. I believe the whole of the fleet, our boat only excepted, got into an eddy ; we escaped only, and by our timely exertions 
gained the opposite side of the island and river, say the right hand side; 
the rest put ashore. Although contrary to Colonel Burr's orders, we alone 
pushed on. 

4^. This day at seven, A. M., we landed at the Chickasaw Bluff, where 
there is an American garrison, commanded by Lieut. Jackson. 

6th. This day at six o'clock, A. M., left this place, and floated all day, 
and landed at nine, P. M., on an island, in consequence of a very high 
wind ; pushed off again at eleven o'clock. 
6 ^.Floated all day; nothing extra. 
7th. Do. 
8th. Do. 

9M. Floated all day, until two o'clock, P. M. ; landed to wait for Col. 
Burr; got some wood; perceived the sign of horses, but no inhabitants 
any where to be found; pushed off again at three o'clock, being joined by 
the Colonel and his boats; floated all night through a very dangerous 
navigation; about eight o'clock one of Col. Tyler's boats being lashed to a, 
flat, and striking against a sawyer, was broken loose, in consequence of 
which Capt. Dean's boat stopped, and dispatched a keel-boat in search of 
the one lost. Major Floyd's boat put ashore, in consequence of being de 
terred by a sudden squall of wind, which arose about eight o'clock ; the 
rest of the boats proceeded. 

IQth. At four o'clock, A. M., got into an eddy; could not get out, the 
night being very dark ; stayed until daylight appeared ; then got out, and 
came up with Col. Burr's two boats, namely, the boat he lived in, and one 
that had horses ; they gave us a signal for landing, with which we complied,x 
and effected a landing in the Mississippi Territory. About twelve o'clock 
this clay, Col. Burr pushed down the river with a bateau and twelve men, 
and appointed to meet us again at Bayou Pierre ; passed Palmyra at halfpast one o'clock'; passed several islands, and landed about fifteen miles 
below. 

11 th. This day pushed off at eight, A. M., and landed at Bayou Pierre 
at four o'clock, P. M. ; joined Col. Burr and party; had some intention of 
staying at this place some time, but were prevented by a rumor spreading 
in the country of our intentions being hostile, in consequence of -which a 
party of militia came and stationed themselves in the woods, some distance from our boats, with an intention to stop us the next morning. 
We being apprised of their intentions, pushed off in the night, and landed 
four miles below, on the Louisiana shore. 

12th. This day were visited by Col. and some of his dragoons,* 

talked with Col. Burr respecting his business, and went away well satis 
fied. This day Major Floyd joined us from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. 

13th. This day were visited by Col. Fitzpatrick and some of his dra 
goons ; we brought them over the river; talked with Col. Burr, and 
seemed well pleased. Col. Fitzpatrick brought with him about sixty men, 
all armed, in order to stop us ; but on hearing our business, he sent the 
men home, and left us quietly. 

14th. Visited by several militia officers. 

IQth. Visited by Col. Shields, Gov. Williams's aide-de-camp, who con 
versed with Col. Burr, and appointed a meeting between him and the 
Governor, and then departed. 

17th. This day Col. Burr started, agreeably to his appointment, to meet 
the Governor at the mouth of Cole's Creek, with several gentlemen with him. 
This day was remarkable for a heavy fall of snow, perhaps four inches deep. 

18th. The water falling rapidly, we thought it prudent to remove from 
our situation ; and, agreeably to the orders of Mr. Blennerhassett, two of 
our boats moved down the river about a mile, being afraid of being blocked 
in by a bar that was outside of the creek, where we then lay. 

Wth. This day Col. Fitzpatrick, with some other officers, came on board, 
and took an inventory of all the stores and property we had on board ; 
we then pushed off, but were immediately challenged by a Major Flaharty, 
with about thirty armed men, in a keel-boat, who ordered us to put on 
shore. Being told that his Colonel was in the rear, and that it was by his 
sanction we put off, he left, and troubled us no more. That night we put 
on shore at the Petit Gulf, on the Louisiana side ; Major Flaharty and 
party immediately opposite, on the other side. 

2Qtk. This day, about ten o'clock, in consequence of a very bad land 
ing, we thought proper to remove our boats up the river, which we effected. 
This day several boats trading to New Orleans were stopped by Major 
Flaharty and party, examined, and permitted to proceed. 

[ The rest of this Journal is in the handwriliny of Harman Blennerhassett.~\ 

In the evening the Major visited H. B. ; professed friendly intentions, 
and a determination to join us, with the greater part of his regiment. 

2lst. We received news of the approach of a Capt. Davison, with a party 
of horse, coming, under the orders of Col. Fitzpatrick, to search for concealed 
arms, supposed to have been secreted in the brush ; during the night a party 
was sent out by to obviate effectually the success of the design. 

22d. This morning an altercation took place between Majors Floyd and 
Flaharty, which induced the former to address a letter to the latter in a 
sort of defiance. This measure having been taken without my approbation, I informed Major Floyd I would not co-operate with him in any acts 
he should enter into upon his letter or motives, but should, by myself and 
my party, resist such conduct on the part of Major Flaharty as I should 
deem improper, or as occasion required. Major Floyd, I believe, appre 
hending no attack or removal of our boats from their present station, 
seemed to yield to my observation, and in the morning made a visit to 
Major Flaharty, to engage with him in a shooting-match. On his return 
to the boats, he informed me that Major Flaharty, this evening, expected 
fresh orders from the Government, to enable him to move our boats down 
to Cole's Creek. Eleven o'clock at night, there were several shot fired 
from Major Flaharty's party on boats passing by to bring them to, but 
without effect. Damage to the boats or their men unknown. This morning Col. Comfort Tyler was taken from his boats, by an escort of the 
militia, to appear before the Governor at Washington, the seat of the Ter 
ritorial Government, about thirty miles from our station. The officer, 
Capt. Davison, who made the requisition to Col. Tyler, observed to him 
that he had no warrant. Col. Tyler agreed to the Governor's wishes with 
out that requisite. This day Major Flaharty, who can neither read or 
write, and is not a magistrate, informed me that he had taken and for 
warded to the Governor the affidavit of a man, who deposed before him. 
that he had seen, fifty miles above our present position in the Petit Gulf, 
thirteen of Col. Burr's boats containing arms and ammunition, with an 
unusual number of men. During several days past, some individuals of 
our party have been obliged, at Washington, to undergo examination, and 
enter into recognizance to testify, on the part of the United States, against 
A. B. at the next federal court, to be held on the first Monday in February. 

About ten o'clock this morning, Major Floyd communicated to me the 
following letter, received by Capt. Burney from Major Flaharty : 

January 23d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

SIR : Not wishing to go to rash measures, I have to inform you that I 
must comply with the orders of the commander-in-chief, if you keep your 
present position; and, as I am certain that it can't be injurious to your 
self nor any of the people with you, I wish you to move opposite the 
mouth of Cole's Creek, where the communication is more convenient for 
you and me. You mentioned in your letter to me, yesterday, that you did 
not wish to put the militia to any more trouble. Your compliance will save 
the march of two companies that are ready to join me, if called on. 
I am, with much esteem, 

Yours, etc., 

JACOB FLAHARTY, 
MAJOR FLOYD. Major, 2d Regiment. 

On perusal of the above letter, which Flaharty could not write, I acquainted Major Floyd that if it was worthy of credit in the intimation it 
held out of the orders of the commander-in-chief, and the truth of his 
menaced reinforcements of two companies, it might as well answer our 
present views and situation to comply as to adhere to the determination 
expressed yesterday, of maintaining our present position ; that, on the 
other hand, the Governor would be as responsible to us and the law for any 
impropriety of conduct toward us by the militia, as for any other acts of 
authority unduly exercised toward us. I therefore suggested to him the 
substance of the following letter in reply to Flaharty : 

PETIT GULF, January 23c?, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

SIR: Your communication, by the hands of Capt. Burney, I just now 
had the honor of receiving. You mention your wish for us to move to the 
mouth of Cole's Creek; the request I would take a pleasure in complying 
with, had not Col. Burr directed me to stay where we now are until his 
further commands. I do expect to have a messenger from Col. Burr to-day, 
perhaps time enough to move down this evening. At all events, we will 
determine, to-morrow morning (23d), what step will be proper for us to 
take. Report says, the officer commanding the district opposite you is 
determined to prevent the commanding officer of the Mississippi Territory 
from interfering with the jurisdiction of the Territory of Orleans. This 
report, if true, may be proper for you to be informed of. At all events, 
we are awaiting a legal investigation into our conduct ; and I contend 
that, during that investigation, and while we are, properly speaking, in 
the hands of its authority, the military law has no right to interfere. I am, 

Respectfully, etc., 

DAVIS FLOYD. 
MAJOR FLAHARTY. 

This letter, by means of the unfounded suggestion, submitted to Major 
Floyd, of the jealousy of the people on the Louisiana side, of any en 
croachments on their jurisdiction, or by other matter it contained, pre 
vented Flaharty from carrying his declarations into effect, if he really 
had authority under orders from the Governor so to do ; and he was re 
moved from his post opposite to us the following morning (24th), on the 
arrival of Col. Fitzpatrtck, who substituted only a party of ten men, under 
the command of Capt. Abrams, with orders to board boats civilly, without 
firing upon them, and seize only such arms and ammunition as they might 
contain. Col. Burr, this day, returned to the boats from Washington, 
where he had remained since the 17th under a voluntary submission to the 
civil authority, which had been exacted of him at Cole's Creek, on his 
reception there on the 17th by Mead, at the head of five or six hundred 
of the militia, half armed and generally discontented, in disregard of the 
connection that had been entered into by Mead and himself. The ActingGovernor, it now appeared, had threatened him with all the armed force of 
the country unless he submitted. No securities, however, were required 
for his appearance at the adjourned Federal Court, to be holden on the first 
Monday in February. His own single recognizance was taken, in the sum 

of dollars. Accordingly, his return to the boats was free. I soon 

heard from him that Mr. Mead had received dispatches announcing the 
statements by Flaharty of what had passed between him and Major Floyd, 
which so exasperated the Governor, that he threatened to have Floyd 
brought to him in irons, but was induced to retract his menaces on learning Flaharty's character to be fraught with the utmost ignorance and 
assurance, while Major Floyd's temper was both mild and amiable. Col. 
Burr also acquainted me with the indignation the Federal Judge, Rodney, 
had expressed at the exercise of the military law over Col. Burr and his 
friends, both in the Mississippi and Orleans Territories ; the Judge assuring him, in opposition to the U. S. Attorney, Mr. Poindexter, that the civil 
authority of the Territory was competent to try him ; adding, at the same 
time, that if Wilkinson, or any other military force, should attempt to 
remove his person out of the Mississippi Territory, prior to his trial, he, 
the Judge, would again, as he expressed it, put on old '"76," and march 
out in support of Col. Burr and the Constitution. This day, about three 
o'clock in the afternoon, my family arrived in the boat of Mr. Thomas 
Butler, who, having, on his way from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>, called to take them on 
board at my house, on the Ohio, there underwent, with eight or ten other 
gentlemen, a captivity for three days, diversified in its scenes by a mock 
trial, in my hall, alternate insult and plunder, committed in common on 
them, my family and property, in a variety of particulars, for which I 
refer to Mr. Neville's journal. 

2,5th. Nothing material occurred till eight o'clock at night, when we 
cast off to drop down about twenty-six miles, to Cole's Creek, opposite 
which we took another station on the Orleans shore. Here we remained, 
without any material prospect of a change in our affairs, till the 27th, when 
we heard that intelligence had reached Mississippi Territory that Col. B.'s 
drafts on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> had been protested, and that Gov. Williams, who had 
returned to resume the functions of his office in the Mississippi Territory, 
was reported to be friendly disposed toward us. Col. B. determined to 
visit the Governor, and set out next morning (28th) for that purpose, and 
to prepare, probably, for his trial on the following Monday. Reports now 
reached us of the near approach to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> of a division of nine or ten 
gun-boats, under the command of Commodore Shaw, bearing a special order 
from the "Secretary of the Navy" to take Col. Burr, or the next in com 
mand uncj^r him, and to take or destroy all the boats under his command. 
By this time the effects of general disorder and want of regulation in the 
use or distribution of liquors and provisions, with a total disregard of all 
pretense at authority whenever attempted to be assumed by superiors, 
which had long since manifested themselves throughout all our numbers, 
now openly broke out among particular leaders, who even threatened to 
turn out of their boats the provisions, in payment for the demands of some 
of the men who had become discontented and threatened to leave us. 

2Qth. Nothing occurred till 2d of February, when the Court at Washing 
ton had not that day charged the grand jury, who, of course, had not found 
any bill against Col. Burr, owing to objections, I suppose, made by the 
Attorney-General, to the jurisdiction of the Court over actions done by 
Col. Burr, without the limits of their Territory. Next day (Feb. 3d), 
Mr. N. brought me intelligence of the arrival of Graham at Washington, 
and of his having had an interview with Col. Burr.

WASHINGTON, January 15fA, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

SIR : Your approach to this country has excited not only the apprehensions of the General Government, but 
alarmed, in a high degree, the good citizens of this Territory. From these causes I have ordered my militia to 
rendezvous at such places as will enable them to guard this Territory against any design inimical to this government; but having heard, through Col. Waldridge, that 
you profess perfect innocence of the views charged to you, I have thought proper to send to you a confidential 
aid-de-camp, to receive from you such information on this subject as you may please to make. He will communicate freely with you, and you may implicitly confide 
in every assurance which he may make in my name. I have the honor to be, 

Your humble servant, 

COWLES MEAD. 

To Col. A. Burr. 

P. S. The gentleman attending Major Shields, is an honorary aid, and one who likewise possesses my fullest 
confidence. Mr. Poindexter, though a high civil officer, visits you as my aid. Yours, etc., 

COWLES MEAD.

WASHINGTON, January 3Ist, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
 
MRS. M. BLENNERHASSETT : 

Our persons and our property are safe from violence 
and from pursuit. It is with regret and mortification 
that I acknowledge, that, at present, nothing more can be 
said ; yet there is reason to hope for something more, for 
permission (how humiliating ! ) to go on to Washita. 

My presence is necessary here, and will be so for three 
or four days. The separation from my friends is extremely 
irksome and painful. Adieu. A. BURR. 

Procuring a boatman's dress, in which to disguise him 
self, he proceeded on his tour. Upon hearing of his 
escape, Williams issued a proclamation, offering two 
thousand dollars for his apprehension and safe delivery to 
the proper authorities. A few days afterward, a negro 
boy was discovered near the mouth of Cole's Creek, oppo 
site which the boats were stationed, riding on a horse 
which belonged to Burr, and having on his surtout coat. 
These circumstances created a suspicion; the boy was 
searched, and, sowed up in the cape of his coat, was found 
a note to the following effect : 

" If you are yet together, keep so, and I will join you 
to-morrow night. In the mean while, put all your arms 
in perfect order. Ask no questions of the bearer, but tell 
him all you may think I wish to know. He does not 
know that this is from me, nor where I am." 

To C. T. and D. F *

DOUGLAS FERRY, Feb. 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
J. GRAHAM, ESQ. : 

SIR : Having heard, from respectable authority, that 
you have forwarded to the President an affidavit of Hugh 
Phelps, wherein he deposed that I had imparted to him 
certain views or objects, in which I participated with 
Col. Burr, hostile to the United States, or to some of the 
Spanish dominions, I am naturally led to inquire how far 
I may inflame or abate the persecution, with which I am 
honored by the Government or its agents, by proposing 
to you to forward another affidavit, to the same quar 
ter, deposing that Col. Phelps had declared, soon after 
the only interview I had with him, that I did not commu 
nicate to him the object. I can not pretend to state the 
facts that may appear on the face of the affidavits on 
either side, until such documents come forward, any more 
than the tenor of fifty other affidavits or testimonies I 
can procure from my neighbors of respectable character, 
who will testify to the very contrary of what Col. Phelps 
has done men, all of them, possessing my good opinion, 
and believing Mr. Phelps is the last man in the world I 
would venture a secret with, if I had any. 

Provided, sir, with such means of counteracting the 
evidence of Mr. Phelps, or any other that may be adduced against me, I can have no other solicitude for the 
issue of an arraignment any where than the intervening 
distress in which my family will be thereby involved. 
But as this nor any other consideration shall ever influence me to shrink from investigation, I now, sir, invite, 
through you, all the justice or persecution of the Grovernment. Why, or how, I may have become personally ob 
noxious to them, or to yourself, the public may hereafter 
understand. But if I am singled out as an early victim 
or example, I shall wish not to be severed from my 
family, by being thrown on board a prison ship, while I 
tender security for my appearance at the city of Washing 
ton or elsewhere, whenever it may be required. 

I request your answer, and with due consideration, 
I remain, sir, your obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

TOCKSHISH, IN THE CHICKASAW NATION, 

(310 miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>^ June 14*A, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
I rest here to-day under the most severe embarrassments I have suffered since I left you ; namely, the state 
of my tormented legs. The respite, however, is not less 
necessary for my horses, which have hitherto performed 
very well. I mention the condition of my legs the more 
freely, "because I know you will not disregard such an 
affliction. But whether from the heat of the weather, 
meager, and often scanty meals, the state of my blood 
has contracted an acrimonious habit it never had before, 
? t is certain the myriads of musquitoes and horse-flies, 
with the almost incessant perspiration that I suffered for 
five days after I left you, which allowed me no repose, 
until exhaustion made me callous, and sleep now in my 
cot, then on the ground, prepared a revival of fresh sensibility to new sufferings, all, I can aver, were not more 
intolerable than the anguish of my legs, which the ardor 
of my industry to prosecute my journey would not until 
now permit me to find ease, even when at rest ; no doubt, 
chiefly from so much pendent motion on horseback. But 
to that benignant Providence, which has so often had mercy upon me, be rendered all gratitude and thanksgiving. 
I shall make good my journey, as I can convert my eye 
into a microscope, by which I am enabled, through Di 
vine goodness, to make this pen write to you. Through 
the same favor I shall pass unhurt through all the difficulties and dangers I may yet encounter, and I will again 
embrace you and our boys, or we shall be indemnified 
hereafter. 

I omit to detail, at present, particulars of the journey 
hitherto. It is true, women and children perform it, for 
women will attempt and perform any possible undertak 
ing, and they will not leave their teams behind ; but it is 
no less certain, that many of them languish on the way ; 
and the hardiest boatmen, and even Joe, who behaves 
admirably, swear they will never again attempt it at this 
season of the year. We are now, by estimation, about 
215 miles from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, of which distance there is about 
fifty miles yet to pass through this Nation. We shall 
take from this place a fresh supply of corn for our .horses, 
and a recruit to our remaining provisions, of two quarts 
of parched meal. You will see by the map, we shall 
then, when we cross Duck river, enter Tennessee, where 
we shall want for nothing. Water has been tolerably 
convenient and palatable so far ; henceforward, I am 
told, it will be very good and plenty. I have had no 
scruple in drinking heartily while contending with heat, 
horse-flies, smoke and musquitoes. How fondly have I 
wished for the solacing society of Harding and Russel. 

! how I could walk then. 

The Chocataw country, for an extent of 250 miles which 

I have passed through, has not been altogether uninter 
esting, either from the condition of the natives, who are 
beginning, at least in the vicinity of this path, to enter 
somewhat into the pastoral state, and in some solitary 
instances, from the example of about one hundred white 
men, settled through their Nation, exhibit some com 
mencements of agriculture, or from the appearance of 
their country, nine-tenths of whicli consist of either 
prairies or timber lands, well stocked with a variety of 
fine grass and plants, which exhibit a pleasing appearance 
from the total freedom from brush and underwood, 
which disfigure all the forests you have seen in America. 
But the Chickasaw lands, for twenty miles back we have 
traveled since we entered the Nation, deserve, in every 
point of view, the character of a Paradise, so far as any 
inland countrv, without the features of water scenery in 
its landscape, can claim it. Besides the beauty and 
variety of the whole vegetable clothing of the country, 
the clearly undulating surface of its woods, and the more 
advanced progress of the Chickasaws in agriculture, and 
the domestic economy that provides for the comforts of 
life, contrasted, as it is, with a tenacity of most of their In 
dian habits and manners, form altogether a variety truly 
interesting. This people must, in less than fifty years, 
become as respectable, in the " shepherd state," as they 
have hitherto been in the characters of the best warriors 
of all the tribes south of the Ohio. They have already 
no hunting ground nearer to them than the Mississippi, 
100 miles distant. This circumstance will insure it. 

I have heard, by the way, pretty consistently, that Bissel is impeached, and will probably suffer for his civilities 
to Col. Burr. Jackson is sent down to the Heights, or 
Orleans, to be tried on a multitude of charges, and Ser 
geant D is taken round by Wilkinson to testify to 

God knows what. 

When you write, as you will, I trust, every week until 
first of November, be careful to set down nothing that 
may not meet the public eye ; and I think it safest to 
inclose to me, under cover to Gen. Tupper. I trust you 
will soon accustom yourself to the free enjoyment of all 
the hospitable kindness and attention that will be tend 
ered to you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> to Bayou Sara : this is one of 
my best hopes, as I fear not we shall be able to find 
opportunities hereafter to requite the goodness of bur 
friends. As I constantly meditate on the prospect of 
your satisfaction with them, they all pass in review of 
my most grateful remembrance. During such moments, 
however, my thoughts seem to soar on the wings of fancy, 
to a hight at which I lose sight of all other mortals, 
except the Scotts ; while at other intervals of my reflections, I seem to gravitate, like falling bodies through the 
air, to Harding, as the immovable center of your comfort 
and protection during my absence. I hope you got my 

first letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=gibson's port" rel="city">GIBSON'S PORT</a>, and my second from C , 

100 miles back. I have only time to say again, God 
bless you and the boys ! The post hurries me. 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

I shall resume the journey before day, to-morrow, 7 
o'clock P. M.

From Mrs. to Mr. Blennerhassett. 

July 6th. 

I received your letter from the Nation, also the one 
previous to it, but derived but little pleasure from the 
general tenor of the last. Its contents are too gloomy, 
and I wanted no addition to the causes of low spirits I 
have experienced ever since you left ; for these, however, 
I know I am to blame. I trust you are in good health. 
Our dear, fine boys are almost the only children here who 
keep well, and grow fat. 

While I find my society more than ever courted, there 
is, and will be till you return, an insurmountable barrier 
to my peace of mind, in the fear of your becoming in 
volved in private quarrels. If they can, with honor, be 
avoided, I trust and pray they will. 

I see no reason for any despondency whatever. We 
can undoubtedly make a good beginning here, and, from 
what I have experienced since your departure, I am per 
fectly satisfied that this climate, in summer as well as 
winter, is every way more desirable than the one I left 
on the Ohio, so that, please God ! our happiness is now 
more in our own keeping than ever before. I trust your 
limbs are already well; if not, I wish you to try the 
leaves of the Jamestown weed. You need only take two 
or three of them, and, after softening them a little by 
beating between the palms of your hands, bind them well 
on the sores, after having first washed them with sugar 
of lead. Repeat the dressing three times, and then apply 
salve made of sugar of lead. 

I hope you will be able to procure all the things mentioned on your list. If you can, I want you. to get some 
of the early cucumber that the Barnes's used to have up 
the Kanawha, and bring every rare-ripe peach tree which 
can be moved out of the garden, as I find that sort are 
not grown in this country. If Peter Taylor, the gardener 
of Blennerhassett, comes, he must bring every flowering 
shrub he can move, or you find room for. 

I left a pair of wafer (not waffle) irons in the kitchen, 
which I wish to have again, if possible. Should it be 
convenient to send my side-saddle, by safe hands, before 
you come yourself, I hope you will do so, as, perhaps, I 
may need it, though I have, at present, more carriages at 
my service than I can possibly use. I trust, however, 
this state of dependence may be removed by your bringing me some sort of a vehicle on your return. 

In my next I shall give you a full account of the way 
in which I have spent my time since you left me : mean 
while, you can hardly calculate the attentions I receive 
from every one ; but Harding and the Scotts will ever be 
foremost in real affection. Ruple, I fancy, is on his way 
up, as is also Captain Leonard. 

I have some prospect of exchanging houses with Captain Yoss. He went two days since in pursuit of Peter 
Dexter for that purpose, and has not yet returned. Mr. 

H will manage the business for me, and when I have 

completed moving, I shall take leave of town, for two or 
three weeks, for Second Creek, accompanied by Miss 
Percy, who has not yet been able to join me, but makes 
fair promises. Should she fail, Mrs. Whittle will go 
with me. 

I have had a most pressing invitation from Mr. and 
Mrs. Borlin, and am expected to visit them when I go 
down : she is a charming little woman. Mr. Hunt has 
not yet returned, but is expected daily. I have hired 
Diana out. Molly and her Spaniard do every thing for 
me ; she is very good, and he the most obliging creature 
in the world. He stays here a great deal, goes to market, 
gets wood, and is said to be a very honest man. 

An aid to General Wilkinson met you near the Nation, 
and said you were well. He also circulated a report, and 
even told Scott, that it was now discovered that Jefferson 
was concerned with Burr, and had even given him his 
cypher. Harman says I must say they are good boys; 
but Dominick* replies, that would be a falsehood. I 
send you their ugly faces. Remember me with affection 
to the Belpr^ folks. God bless you ! farewell till next week ! 

M. BLENNERHASSETT. 


P. S. I find I must inclose this in a wrapper (envelope), 
as I am too lazy to copy it, and am hourly expecting com 
pany to call. Tell Peter Taylor, if he should not like to 
stay with us, he can, by supplying the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> market, 
very soon make a handsome independence for his family ; 
but he had better leave them where they are for the 
present, as they will be much healthier, and he can maintain them there for almost nothing compared to the cost 
of living here ; besides, when he deems it prudent, he 
can have them brought down at almost any time. Say to 
Amy that the boys speak every day of her children, and 
that none of them shall have reason to repent coming to 
this country.

Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>" rel="city"><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a></a>, June 29th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>, past 5 P. M. 

I arrived here about one o'clock this day, being the 
eighteenth since I left you, including about three and a 
half days, during which I lay by ; namely, at Greenville 
and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=gibson's port" rel="city">GIBSON'S PORT</a>, nearly one and a half days ; one at 
Tockshish, in the Chickasaw Nation, from whence I 
wrote to you, as I did from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=gibson's port" rel="city">GIBSON'S PORT</a> ; and one more 
a little within the entrance of this state, fifty-three miles 
back, occasioned by the state of the horses, all of which 
had completely given out with fatigue and sore backs. 
It required much address to get here, even when we did ; 
and here we are to remain, for five days at least, to get 
the horses and my legs in a condition to proceed, and 
perform the remainder of the journey. 

My entrance into the United States has not been very 
auspicious. Last Friday evening, soon after I had passed 
what is called the line that separates Tennessee from the 
"Wilderness, I endured, for upwards of an hour, the heaviest fall of rain I was ever under ; indeed, none ever fell 
heavier. Packing through mud in the pathway, covered 
with six miles of running water all along, part of the 
time in the dark, I was still, however, able to keep my 
self perfectly dry, by passing my head through a hole in 
the middle of my blanket, which hung on my shoulders 
and covered me every-where, a contrivance I supposed 
myself indebted for to the care Hardings' servants have 
had of my great coat. The next mishap was my last detention, fifty-three miles back. The next was meeting a 
man yesterday morning, about forty-five miles back, who 
looked strongly at me, and passing by to a man who was 
traveling in company with me, inquired of him my name ; 
then said he had a letter for me, but would not deliver it, 
as it lay, he said, in the bottom of his saddle-bags. Had 
Joe or I learned this before we had traveled too far to 
turn back, we should certainly have had the letter, one 
way or another. You will get it, I hope, and forward it, 
with any others you receive for me, with all possible dis 
patch. 

Journeying on hither, I was much mortified, as I 
stopped to breakfast yesterday, by the perusal in a paper 
of the first proceedings at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> against Col. Burr, 
which evince the most rancorous malice of the Government against his life. But they will be disappointed by 
the negative and cautious conduct he has all along pur 
sued. In the course of the proceedings it appears Jefierson's runners have been industrious enough to ferret out 
Peter Taylor and Jacob Albright, to prove that there was 
a body of armed men assembled on Blennerhassett's 
Island. This may surprise you, but it matters not. I 
need not write to you the particulars I have further seen ; 
they will reach you by the papers sooner then through me. 
Some short time before day this morning, my next torment was a dream, where I slept last night, ten miles 
back, in which I beheld our Harman fallen a victim to 
the bite of a dog, and you an insane mourner, wan and 
sallow, without a tear. You know I am sincere in denying all virtue to dreams, either as cause or effect of human 
events. I therefore mention this, with every confidence 
in God's mercy, that he will permit you to tell me our 
darling boy has continued well, long after the period of 
my dream. But the manner in which you there appeared 
to me has all day long so haunted me, that I wished, soon 
after I got my valise taken to my room, to chase away 
such a phantom with a view of the little Mammy, when, 
alas ! my yet last and greatest misfortune was visited 
upon me the treasure, the greatest, after yourself and 
the boys, I could have in this world, for if I do not 
recover it it is irreparable how shall I mention it? I 
lost your second self. Joe sets out twenty miles back 
ward, to-morrow early, in quest of it, where we have 
some hopes of recovering it. ! had Mrs. Alston, by 
one of the best impulses that ever actuated her, had she 
purloined it, how consoling would be the prospect of my 
journey, it would animate me to visit it. How, my love, 
will you soothe this heaviest of my sorrows? I have 
complained to you of none until this overtook me. May this be the last letter you will receive from me in such a 
state of mind as I now suffer under ; may I be blest with 
the recovery of that talisman that I now so fully feel 
would never fail to keep my strength from falling, and 
my hopes from becoming forlorn in the midst of all I 
may suffer from the malice of my enemies captivity or 
death. Perhaps it is reserved for me to recover this sol 
ace of every trouble that I shall endure, until I again em 
brace you. 

So far I had written yesterday. You will feel with 
what weight at my heart, though I knew before I sat 
down this letter will not leave this before Friday. To 
day, Tuesday, I have been chiefly occupied since I got 
Joe off on the greatest service, if successful, he can ever 
render me with further perusals of the proceedings at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, up to the 6th instant, when Wilkinson had 
not arrived, though hourly expected, as it was supposed 
he must have set out three weeks sooner from Orleans 
than he did. I hope your friends, Harding and Scott, 
will get you the fullest accounts of the trial, from time to 
time. Nothing can hardly interest you more.- You may 
read some things that may alarm you for A. B. or H. B. ; 
but I have no doubt the rancor of Government will be 
baffled in its purpose to fasten any treason upon us, or 
even a misdemeanor. 

This place appears very dull and ugly, but tolerably 
cheap. The inhabitants are chiefly the offcastings of 
North Carolina, and I do not know a single face I have 
yet seen. The living, of course, at this inn, is rough and 
uncomfortable, except the tea and coffee, which will 
redeem many sins of the table with me. But the attendance is very bad every- where, and criminal, where I want it most, in the stables, at a time when I can not walk. 
On this view of my situation, I have thoughts of moving 
six or eight miles onward to-morrow, there to wait for 
whatever Thursday's post may bring here for me ; 'and 
endeavor to get the poor horses on, by easy journeys, as 
well as we can. It is now almost nightfall. I look for 
and dread Joe's return every hour to-night. You see, 
however, I am lighter at heart than I was yesterday ; and 
is not this a crime in my situation, yet no-way mended ? 
I had not light to finish the last sentence of Tuesday 
evening, when Beaumont, the pilot, who took me over 
the Falls in one of Floyd's boats, called upon me to in 
quire after him, and told me Mrs. F. had paid the debt 
of nature, about the middle of this month, having left 
behind her a fine child. It is painful, but necessary, that 
we should be the messengers of these sad tidings, if they 
have not otherwise reached him, because his affairs at 
home require his speedy return, his property of every sort 
depending only on the care of a negro wench. 

Yesterday, I spent the whole day in perplexing anxiety 
for Joe's absence, and the care of my unfortunate legs, 
on which it is not only misery to walk, but even to put 
them on the ground for a moment. They also prevent 
my rest a considerable part of the night. Nothing seems 
to succeed but close bandaging from the toe to the knee, 
which I have again resorted to. Up to this moment, "Wed 
nesday noon, July 2d, we have no intelligence of the thief 
who, we doubt not, stole my treasure. I have more than 
one runner out after him ; have offered ten dollars, and 
would not depart hence, if myself and horses were able, 
till all chance was hopeless. Joe has returned, after a 
fruitless and unremitting search for him of forty hours. I 
hope Russell has returned, and is received as he deserves. 

Assure Kitty I cordially wish her no worse a husband 
than would write to her, and feel for her, after thirteen 
years' trial, as I do for you. I depend upon his vaccinating 
Harman, and attending you all three, if necessary. The 
state of your chest, I rely on your solemn promise to me, 
has surely been submitted to him, and I hope he has lost 
no time to administer every palliative and preventive he 
could best imagine. My concern for your keeping the 
boys' heads and feet always covered, I can never cease to 
dwell upon and repeat. 

I must leave you for some sort of dinner. God grant 
I may be able to add one more pleasing line than any I 

have yet written, before the mail closes this evening. 

Well, "par hazard," I have made a better dinner than 
any I have had yet in this place, i. e., the first bit of 
wheaten bread I could eat, and one cut of good mutton, 
well roasted. But does this ennui afflict a man who was 
satisfied and cheerful, after forty -five miles' ride, with half 
a tin-cup of water-gruel twice a day, in an Indian wilderness ? Have I only returned into what is called civilized so 
ciety, to wish myself out of it? Much have I projected to 
execute of that active exertion which Harding so kindly 
urged me to. But I am now a cripple, without a leg to 
stand upon, or a mind capable of emerging from that sea 
of trouble in which it has sunk so deeply. I shall, how 
ever, wait the news next Monday's mail may bring from 
the eastward. It is not impossible some tidings may 
arrive to determine me hence westward, even direct to 
the chance of an asylum, under the government of Grand 
PrS ; for I have little doubt Jefferson-, if he can not 
effect our ruin by our conviction, will seek it by harrassing us to beggary. I think if I should oe prosecuted 
with the virulence that has marked the proceedings 
against Burr, my acquittal, by the trouble and expense 
that would be incurred to obtain it, would be worth little 
more than a condemnation. One thing is certain, I shall 
take nothing from you to fee lawyers. I shall have none 
that may not volunteer their assistance. So you will 
have another short letter from this place, or its neighbor 
hood, to announce to you upon what terms, and in what 
temper, I leave it: my anxiety augments largely for frequent and long letters from you. 

I trust you have long since left the Chateau of Poindexter, and have previously made every necessary arrangement for a regular intercourse with -the Post-office 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. I hourly expect Col. Panil, whom I over 
took and passed by 150 miles back, without seeing him. 
I wish he was come to break in upon my ennui. I have 
nothing to comfort me but this last refuge hope. All 
this tumult of my heated head has it been kindled by 
you, or a trinket ? God bless you all three, and all our 
good friends. The mail is near closing. Adieu.

Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, Sunday, July 6th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

As I am very anxious to leave this to-morrow evening, 
after I shall peruse whatever I may find interesting by 
the mail, which may occupy me the best part of the day, 
I now use that time it might cost me to-morrow to tell 
you my legs are now nearly quite well, which I am in 
debted for, to a week's rest, and the most careful skill I 
possess. Col. Panil arrived here on Friday evening, 
much improved in his looks by his long journey, in which 
he did not distress himself by hard riding, whatever he 
might otherwise have suffered from insects and hot 
weather. He eats like a dray-horse, and can not find a 
single complaint, in the catalogue of all human, bodily 
infirmities to appropriate to himself. There is one there, 
however, which, though he will not see it, or utter its 
name, has fastened pretty hard upon him. Hypochon 
dria has marked him for her own, and he will sink under 
her, unless he abandons his plantation near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. I 
have been so far particular, that you may, if you have an 
opportunity, convey to his family a more unbiassed 
sketch of his situation, than they will probably receive 
from himself. 

By a private arrival here to-day, I collect, by calculation on the intelligence by way of Knoxville, Wilkinson 
had arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, but did not probably get there 
before the 17th or 18th ultimo. It is most likely the 
grand jury has been detained to the period of his arrival. 
I hope to-morrow's papers will afford more satisfaction. 
Have you really missed writing to me by two mails that 
have left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> since I came away, without your having been prevented by something you could not obviate. 
Judge of my mortification to see Col. Panil read letters 
from home of 23d, while I was looking over <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> 
papers of the same date^, after I had left you on the llth. 
Tt will give me five days' work to get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, say 
200 miles, with horses in the condition of mine ; and, as 
I shall endeavor not to delay there longer than two days 
to rest the horses, I fear I have little chance of hearing 
from you before I reach Marietta ; so little have you 
cared, or so unhappily have you been forbidden to use 
the time which is past. You will surely need no further 
hints of this sort. I hope you have not suffered the 
idolatrous grief, with which I filled my last letter, to 
affect you much. It was a weakness in me to pour the 
melancholy effusions of my heart into your breast ; but 
how could I resist so natural a remedy for my pain ? 
While I possessed your image, I did not feel how really I 
was an idolater. When my hard fortune deprived me of 
it, I could see nothing in the loss so lively as the image 
of your death. Hence, hope, my last refuge, led me to 
dwell upon yourself; besides, I thought you could not be 
afflicted by my misfortune as I am. Joe, and others, are 
out still, and yesterday I again advertised in the paper, 
and am not absolutely in the abandonment of despair to 
recover my treasure. I already feel, however, time will 
wear out the impression of this calamity, as it effaces all 
others. So far in my fifth letter, which I will continue 
to-morrow. 

The mail arrived late this morning, Monday, 7th, and 
brings no <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> papers. I have seen, however, a 
Virginia paper of the 12th ultimo, by which it appears 
that Burr had applied to the court for a " subpena ducestecum" directed to the President, requiring him to appear 
as a witness, and bring along with him a letter, he stated 
in one of his messages to Congress to have received from 
Wilkinson, which letter has not yet been made public. 
The chief justice doubted of the power of the court to 
order the personal attendance of the President, and fixed 
upon the next day to have his mind made up, by an argument on the motion. 

It has rained so hard, by frequent and heavy showers 
all day, that I should not have set out at any rate. To 
morrow I shall be accompanied by a Doctor Floyd, the 
husband of the ci-devant Miss Preston. We shall be 
together better than half the way, when he will strike 
oft* to Louisville. Since writing the above, I have seen 
some lengthy articles of further proceedings at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
which you may first learn, and inform Harding, etc., that 
Burr's motion has been granted, after great and splendid 
exertions by himself and his counsel, particularly Edmond 
Randolph, and that the celebrated original cypher letter 
is not forthcoming, having been said to be lost ; that 
Randolph (Edmond) said in court, " Wilkinson, in a few 
weeks, would be in the rank of a private citizen ; " and 
that from private letters received here, it is believed, that 
immediately after the trial, he will have to settle his private accounts with Gen. Jackson, and four or five other 
persons. I have also seen a detailed account of the object 
and issue of a Mr. Burling's mission to Mexico, by 
which it appears he was chiefly sent to insure the balance 
of $300,000, of which Wilkinson had before received 
$120,000, transported from St. Antoine to his quarters on 
mules, in the night. On the whole, Mr. Jefferson and 
his party must be ruined, by the support they have 
afforded Wilkinson, even if it were possible Burr could 
be convicted of any thing. Farewell, my love ! if I do 
not write again on the road, I shall immediately on reaching <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, June 8th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

DEAR SIR : Your favor of February last was received 
by me a few days before I left Marietta for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. 
I most sincerely regret that a service of foreign attachment, of the 20th of February, has placed such of your 
property as was under my control out of my power. The 
writ was served on account of Miller, of Kentucky ; and 
Sanders, of Kentucky, has since filed in a claim. A writ 
of foreign attachment has also been served on D. Woodbridge, Esq., attaching the claims you had upon him ; 
and all your movable property at the "Island" is at 
tached. A certificate from the sheriff follows, by which 
you will perceive that property of every description in 
my hands was attached : 

. " I do hereby certify, that on the 20th day of February, 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>, I served a writ of foreign attachment on D. Woodbridge, as garnishee of H. Blennerhassett, attaching all 
the lands, tenements, goods, rights and credits, moneys 
and effects, which the said Blennerhassett might have in 
his, the said Woodbridge's hands, or possession. 

" JOHN CLARK, Sheriff. 

" County of Washington, State of Ohio." 

The inclosed letters, with one which I shall lodge in 
the Post-office at the same time with this, I took the lib 
erty of opening in February, just as I was going over the 
mountains, thinking they might require some attention 
and answers. I should have sent them to you long since, 
but did not know where to direct them. You will receive 
here, with your account, a letter from Col. Gushing, which 
makes a different package, but will be put in the office at 
the same time. I expected to have seen you at this place. 
The report in our country was, that you were arrested, 
and were to have your trial at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. I should think 
it much better for your interest, if you do not return to 
the Island, to have an attorney vested with full powers, 
to attend to your business in Marietta and Virginia. 
Your property has, and will continue to suffer very much, 
unless you have a person authorized to attend to it. You 
probably heard from Col. Gushing, that your negroes had 
left Virginia, and were strolling about on our side of the 
river ; that Barker, in consequence of a letter of yours, 
of the 9th December, had recovered about $400 for the 
work done on four unfinished boats, although he had 
offered before to take from me $200, which circumstance 
was known to James Wilson ; that the Neals and Phelps 
had recovered a considerable sum against you, to satisfy 
which demands, Ransom, and a greater part of your mov 
able property on the Island, was sold. I can not give 
you any particulars relating to these transactions, as I 
was over the mountains from February until May, and 
the day I arrived at home was subpoenaed to attend Col. 
Burr's trial, at this place. Buell has gone on, under the 
direction of the Government, to sell such a part of the 
pork, meal, etc., etc., as he attached, and the boats are 
fitting up to take the United States' troops to St. Louis. 
"Wishing yourself and family much happiness, I am, 
Your obedient servant, D. WOODBRIDGE.

Mrs. Blennerhassett to Blennerhassett. 

I can scarcely express the joy communicated to me by 
your last letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>. Thank God, the anxiety 
of your mind is somewhat relieved. I have little doubt 
that Col. Pannil's hypochondria did you more service 
than even a cheerful companion could have done. What 
a misfortune, in your state of mind, not to have got the 
letter which Mr. Tyrrel, of this place, passed you with 
in his saddle-bags. I now inclose it, and hope by this 
time the attachments may be in a fair way to be taken 
off our poor property. I inclose every other letter I have 
received, except one from D. Wbodbridge and one from 
Col. Gushing, as I trust, long before this reaches you, 
you will have seen them both. I feel greatly for the impression which must be made on you by the present state 
of the Island ; but think, my dear husband, how thankful 
we may be to have preserved the health of our dear boys, 
and also yours, during such a dreadful journey. 

Col. Burr has every thing in his favor, and I now think 
will never let us sustain any eventual injury. You can't 
think with what joy and pride I read what he says of his 
daughter. I never could love one of my own sex as I do 
her : how can she live with such a man as Alston? You 
see he has not had humanity, or even politeness enough, 
to answer your letter. I did not write the mail after 
your departure, and the week following. Thought the 
surest way for my letter to reach you would be to write 
to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. I wish I had calculated better, but trust 
your uneasiness is long since removed. After I wrote 
last week, I went to spend some time with the Scott's ; 
but after leaving town, I learned of the arrival of a 
French Consul, who wished to rent my house. Mrs. 
Whittle to whom I am under the greatest obligations 
was confined with a pleurisy. I was therefore under the necessity of spending a day at with her, and took 
that opportunity of engaging half of James Moon's 
house, on the condition that if he had an offer for the 
whole, he was to give me the refusal. Mrs. Whittle keeps 
possession of the other half, where she will reside a good 
deal when recovered, which I hope will be soon, as she 
was much better yesterday, which I spent with her. "We 
are to go together to Second Creek, where I have pressing invitations from Berling's family to visit, but I am in 
doubt whether I ought to go there ; I will consult my 
valuable friend and adviser on all occasions. Poor man ! 
he has much anxiety about Winthrop, who has constant 
returns of pleurisy, and as he is cutting two back teeth, 
we are in hopes they are the cause of his illness. My 
visit to Scott's, you see, was curtailed, as I went out on 
Monday evening, and returned on Thursday, when I saw 
the gentleman whose name I do n't yet know ; referred 
him to Harding, saying my rent would be the same I paid 
myself, and he might have the place for the continuance 
of my lease. I then went home ; about the middle of the 
day, Thursday, had all my things packed up, and many 
of them removed that evening. The rest I had here, and 
next morning took possession of my new habitation, 
which was in such disorder that it took me two days, 
with the assistance of Molly and her hushand, to settle 
myself, so that altogether I underwent much fatigue; 
but, thanks to my constitution, I am recovering from a 
bad cold, received from exposure when heated, and pains 
in all my limbs, occasioned by my violent exertions, and 
being too tired to sleep for three nights ; but yesterday I 
rested well with Mrs. Whittle, and last night slept sound 
ly. I have this day put Dominick to a most excellent 
school in town, in a healthy, airy place. Thanking God 
for every thing, our situation is a Paradise to the one we 
left ; you will soon feel the benefits of it; 't is impossible 
here to feel heat at any hour of the day, and I have every 
convenience around me, but still I miss the Island. 

Harman says, "tell 'Pappy' I am a very good boy." 
Dominick has just returned from school to dinner. He 
bids me tell you how he loves you; he has come home 
quite pleased, though Mr. Harding and I left him crying 
at school. The schoolmaster's name is Graham, and it 
seems he had taken it into his head, " it was, as he said, 
that Graham who was bad to Col. Burr and us." You 
must 'know, I have lately learned from Col. Scott that 
Graham actually proposed to him to invite Col. Burr to 
his plantation, and when there, under the shelter, as it 
might be supposed, of his honor and hospitality, to pro 
cure good horses, and kidnap him off to the Federal city. 
Col. Scott made answer/ that he already had done his 
duty, under the command of "Wilkinson, by going to 
Cole's Creek, and would do nothing more. He, Scott, 
was rather intoxicated when he told me this. God bless 
you ! M. BLENNERHASSETT.

To Mrs. M. Blennerhassett. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, July 18A, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

It should afford you the fullest proof of my contentment, 
in my present situation, to learn, that without any inter 
ruption of good health, I have not appropriated any part 
of my time, since Tuesday, to writing to you. When I 
was closing my letter to you that day, I thought it would 
go from hence next morning ; I am happy since to hear" 
it will not go forward before this, which, I hope, you will 
first read. In the midst of my occupation, by the cares 
of my concerns with the Government, I have made 
arrangements for removing, I expect, the greatest part 
of the incumbrances affecting our property on the Island. 
Miller, who, you know, attached the chief part of our 
effects, is not here, but will probably accept of the same 
accommodations, accepted by Mr. Sanders, namely, a 
transfer of Alston's obligation, with a deed of trust on 
the Island, as a further security. Our valued friend 
Harding will explain this to you. He ought to see my 
letters to you, while the press of more indispensable occu 
pation prevents my writing to him. Details relating to 
my arrest on Tuesday evening, and the proceedings that 
have already, and will hereafter occur, you will see, must 
be too voluminous to find place in my letters. You must 
content yourself with the statement you will find ot 
them in the papers. I will not fail, however, to give you 
such particulars as you may not see there. 

The degrees of adversity seem to graduate the scales 
of friendship, and the sincerity of the professions we 
receive in life. I have been visited by Col. Meade, who 
has not probably ridden to town for two years, on any 
two other occasions, while Morton, the Harts, and many 
others you would first count upon, have not appeared 
within the walls. More call upon me, however, than I 
wish to see, while poor Tracy is offended with me, be 
cause I will not take any of the little money he has 
gathered by so many years' hard earning, and several 
other persons daily load me with general offers of service. 
If confinement could, in itself, have any ills for me, they 
could not fail to be greatly abated, by the interest excited 
by my visitors and the unremitting exercise of my pen. 
But while I have these resources aided, besides, by the 
kindest attentions of the jailer and his family, who in no 
instance omits to render my situation not only easy, but 
even comfortable, without transgressing the line of demarkation between his duty and his inclination I hope 
the ease I experience, and the indifference I feel toward 
future prospects, will not induce you to suspect that the 
most loathsome dungeon, or the most unjust issue of my 
prosecution, could exhibit me unworthy of the favor of 
your constancy and virtue. Although I live very com 
fortably in every respect, Mrs. Sanders, late Miss Nich 
olas, persists in sending me a nice breakfast every 
morning, and Mr. Postlethwaite has endeavored to pro 
cure my removal to his house, a mile distant in the 
country ; but popular passion is so strongly engaged on 
the side of the Government, that it could not be effected 
in this focus of Democracy ; the ardor of which, however, 
I am generally assured the manner of my deportment, 
and address in the court have cooled down into some 
degree of sympathy and confidence in my honor. 
I have been very much engaged the last two days in 
preparing letters and various papers for Joe to take to 
the Island. I got him off in the afternoon ; he took with 
him two new horses I got for the three I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> 
with, which he will take to his uncle's on the Monangahela, and keep until he takes them down to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
where I shall want him and Scott to prove the inveterate 
animosity borne me by some of the Wood county witnesses I expect to appear against me. I think it probable 
I may have occasion, on my defense, to make use of the 
first letter I wrote to Col. Burr; that being destroyed, 
probably my letter-book may be received as evidence of 
its contents. The book, therefore, which I left in the 
small trunk, containing my papers, together with every 
letter you can there find, or in any part of my writingdesk, from Col. Burr to you, or myself, you must, with 
the aid of Mr. Harding, or other friends, whose zeal and 
punctuality can be depended upon, have forwarded to me 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, together with the morocco case, containing 
my music, and the two sheets of manuscript I lent 
Mrs. Wallace, with my spectacles; the whole carefully 
packed, sealed and directed, in a small trunk or box, in 
the safest and most expeditious manner, by Orleans, to 
some port where I may get the earliest intelligence of its 
arrival, and thence procure it by the coach. I expected 
the return to town last evening of my young friend, Da 
vid Meade, from the country, where he is fatiguinyly 
employed in serving subpenas for witnesses on the part 
of Col. Burr. On Monday I shall set out in his charge 
he being deputy-marshal with a guard of four, three, at 
least, of whom are respectable, and will, I am assured, 
prove agreeable companions. I am extremely sorry to 
find the injury to private individuals of this country in 
consequence of a baseless authority for Burr's financial 
operations here last autumn, far exceeding my greatest 
suspicions. If it be shown that he had not funds and 
friends pledged to him to warrant his drafts, his conduct 
would appear nefarious enough to displace all the friend 
ships he ever formed. These strictures are particularly 
extracted from me by something I have heard of him 
relating to myself in a pecuniary sense, which will be 
examined, and come hereafter to your knowledge, if ma 
terial. They may therefore be kept secret from all but 
friends, in whose honor and attachment we can confide. 
David Meade has just left me. We shall certainly go on 
Monday, and proceed by easy journeys, comfortably 
equipped. Beware to enter upon Dominick's heart, but 
by small and cautious advances while informing him of 
my situation. Welcome the means you may derive from 
it, of forming him to a habit of patience and courage in 
suffering ; pity for the vices of mankind, and a steady 
contempt for malice, which the vengeance of power can 
never subdue. As it regards yourself, reflect and rejoice 
that your husband will not be unworthy of you by the 
tenor of his life ; while, through all the trials he may yet 
pass, the approving spirit of your virtue will embellish 
his fame and smile upon his courage. I have written to 
my friends, Jas. S. Lewis & Co., to honor Mr. Harding to 
amount of $500 or $600 to answer your occasions, as well 
as to accept all bills drawn by yourself, to amount of my 
remaining funds in their hands: this last instruction I 
gave them in contemplation of your making a small purchase, and having need of some money to make ready 
payments and prepare for getting in a crop the ensuing 
season, which you ought to endeavor to effect for the 
children in the manner I have proposed; though any 
other you may be advised to will not he displeasing to 
me. Mr. Biggs will soon, I hope, reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, with 
some few hands, and I have begged of Col. Gushing to 
endeavor, as soon as possible, to send you every thing he 
can from the Island, from whence I think it probable you 
will receive some supplies in the course of this fall. My 
detention at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> will extend nearly to Christmas, 
owing to the distances from which I shall be obliged to 
collect my witnesses ; so that if I shall be able to run the 
gauntlet through Democratic juries and witnesses, you 
may easily calculate the time I could return to you by 
sea, or by land and the Ohio, taking the Island in my 
way. In the mean time, it is possible I shall not be kept 
in jail, but confined in a comfortable way in the Peniten 
tiary, or other safe quarters, under guard, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
as Burr now is. The federal marshal there has a good 
character from David Meade, and is brother to General 
Scott. Continue to repeat to all our worthy friends, par 
ticularly Harding, Col. and Mrs. Scott, and Russell, etc., 
etc., my grateful obligations for their goodness to you ; 
tell Russell I do not cry " Divil burn the iron boults," 
though I sometimes sing " Smolileu." 

A mail in to-day from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and no letters from 
you. I have had but one ; the postmaster's date being 
23d ult., concerning the boys' works. For God's sake, 
write oftener, and give me the satisfaction of hearing 
how many of my letters, this making the seventh or 
eighth, you received from your husband, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. As I can't write to many of your friends, I hope 
all will excuse me. 

Sunday noon, July 19th. I am just going out to walk 
in town, to make some visits with the jailer. H. B.

SIR : Your favor of the 20th was delivered to me ; the 
apology you offer, on the subject of my fee, is abundantly 
sufficient, and the compensation you propose, adequate. 
You will be pleased to inclose a Virginia bank note to 
me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, by the mail. I did not understand 
that by the agreement between Mr. Sanders and you, 
Mr. Miller was to be any way interested in the " deed of 
trust " upon your Island, and am pretty positive it was 
not agreed that he should be concerned in it, which is 
evident, indeed, from the face of the deed itself. Never 
theless, you may give Miller an order upon Sanders, to 
pay him out of the proceeds of the sale of the Island, 
if they should exceed Mr. S.'s demand, and Mr. Alston 
should not be willing or forced to pay according to his 
engagement. I think, therefore, you ought to acknowl 
edge the deed before the General Court in Virginia. 
You will only, by refusing to do it, give Mr. Sanders the 
unnecessary trouble of having the deed returned to be 
proven and certified from this place, or commencing a 
suit against you, to coerce an acknowledgment. 

Your obedient servant, HENRY CLAY.

MY DEAREST HUSBAND : After having experienced the 
greatest disappointment at not having heard from you 
for two mails, I at length learn of your arrest, which 
afflicts and mortifies me, because it was an arrest. 
think, had you of yourself gone to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and so 
licited a trial, it would have accorded better with your 
pride, and you would have escaped the unhappiness of 
missing my letters, which I wrote every week to Mari 
etta. God knows what you may feel and suffer on our 
account before this reaches you to inform you of our 
health and welfare, in every particular; and knowing 
this, I trust and feel your mind will rise superior to every 
inconvenience that your present situation may subject 
you to ; despising, as I do, the paltry malice of the up 
start agents of Government, and that you may in some 
measure be the means of exposing them to the world. 
Let no solicitude whatever for us damp your spirits ; we 
have many friends here, who do the utmost in their 
power to counteract every disagreeable sensation which I 
suffer from your absence. I have removed into a part of 
Mr. Moon's house, where I can scarcely feel the heat of 
the weather, having let mine to the French Consul, who 
has come to reside here. The boys have a good school, 
and I find many conveniences here which I wanted at 
Poindexter's house. Mrs. Whittle spends most of her 
time here, which is a great advantage now, when I do n't 
go any- where, which I have determined not to do till I 
learn the result of your affairs, though pressed by all my 
acquaintances to go to the country, where I spent some 
time before I learned of the alteration of your course. I 
inclose several letters of business to General Tupper, at 
Marietta, for you, among which was the one that Mr. 
Sorrel, of this place, had in his possession when he passed 
you in the wilderness, but which can be of no consequence now. Mr, Biggs has returned with only three 
negroes, not having been able to procure funds for more. 
I shall live in the hope of hearing from you next mail, 
and entreat you, by all that is dear to us, not to let any 
disagreeable feelings on account of our separation enervate your mind at this time. Remember, that every one 
will read with great interest whatever concerns you, but 
still, do n't trust too much to yourself; consider your 
want of practice at the bar, and, if I still retain the same 
influence over you which you have over me, do n't spare 
the fee of a lawyer ; we shall never miss it in this coun 
try, and if we did, that, in such a case, should be no con 
sideration now. Assure Col. Burr of my warmest ac 
knowledgments for his and Mrs. Alston's kind remem 
brance, and tell him to assure her that she has inspired 
me with a warmth of attachment that never has, nor ever 
can diminish while I live. I wish him to urge her to 
write to me : a letter from her now would be most accept 
able God bless you ! M. BLENNERHASSETT. 

I hope you have done tormenting yourself about the 
loss of my picture. I inclosed you, to Marietta, what is 
of infinitely more value, the profiles of the two darling 
lovely boys.

Do n't startle at a word ; I am not in the quarters of 
old M ; you must wait for a description of my lodg
mg until I conclude some little account of my journey

This has been as comfortable and accommodating as the 
severity of the weather and much fatigue would permit. 
The guard, consisting of five gentlemen, vied with each 
other all the way in emulating the exertions of that excel 
lent young man, David Meade, to promote my ease. I 
had, consequently, no restraint, and might, I believe, have 
effected my escape, if I had been disposed to attempt it. 
We arrived in town to-day, the 16th inclusive since we 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, a quarter before 2 o'clock. We rode up 
to the Washington tavern, where we had an excellent 
dinner; after which I was visited by another deputymarshal with a warrant for high-treason, and conducted 
in a carriage to this place, where I am lodged in a suite 
of commodious apartments, affording me a walk of forty 
paces in length, lately occupied by Col. Burr, who has 
been removed to another house, under guard, for the 
more convenient intercourse with his counsel during his 
trial ; these are numerous, and all volunteers in his 
defense. I was not half an hour here when I had a lively 
note from Col. Burr, a present of tea, sugar and cakes 
from Mrs. Alston, and a visit from Alston, and Edmond 
Randolph, to offer his advice and services gratis. Morgan 
Neville has been looking for me, and was denied admittance to my room at the tavern, through officiousness or 
mistake, for all my friends may come here to me, though 
I can't go out to them. Mr. Randolph and Alston assure 
me the prosecutions for treason have already become 
ridiculous among the best informed, so that none of us 
will probably be hanged, nor can a conviction for the 
misdemeanor be effected from any thing we can learn, 
any more than from any acts or declaration of ourselves, 
for none such ever escaped us to warrant one. Our only 
indemnity, therefore, will consist in our promoting the 
eclat, or whatever it may be, which will reward the zeal 
of the Government for our persecution. 

I had a visit to arrest the progress of my letter from 
Mr. Mercer ; he sat fully two hours with me, and was as 
interesting as he always is. My new lodging, though 
spacious and commodious, is unfurnished ; I have there 
fore been forced to have indispensable necessaries furnished from the tavern, which, however, I shall only 
continue until I can make more economical arrangements. 
In my anxiety to save for you and the boys, I must still 
indulge my pride by spurning the liberal subsistence 
allowed by the United States to their State prisoners, of 
fifty cents per day. I hope you will duly receive my two 
letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> jail, and forward the things I 
therein wrote for. Request of Harding to see or write 
to Tyler, to advise him to offer a surrender of himself, 
and get subpened, if he does not hear soon after you get 
this, that the Government will abandon the chase they 
are at present engaged in ; I say abandon, for it is now 
generally believed, by all parties, that two of the grand 
jury, of the most respectable character, would not have 
concurred in finding any bill for treason, and none, probably, would have been found, if these had not mistaken 
the meaning of the judge's report of his opinion in case 
of Swartwout and Ogden. Having yesterday rode fortyfive miles, and thirty-five to-day, before the variety of 
incidents that has occupied me this evening, and having 
other matters to engage me for an hour before I go to 
bed, I will reserve the rest of this sheet for such part of 
the news of to-morrow as may concern me, and may not 
reach you through the papers. Good night. 

Wednesday, 11 o'clock, P. M. Variety is charming, and 
never more pleasantly exemplified than in the succession 
of that of my levees here. I believe I should have been 
stupid, or perhaps indisposed a little to-day, from the 
transition from great exercise in the open air and broiling 
sun to sudden confinement, if I was not almost hourly 
stimulated by the appearance of some person I am pleased 
to see, or the hearing of some news to interest me. As 
to persons, I have seen this morning Mr. Botts, who will 
also take part in my defense, without pecuniary compen 
sation from me, and I expect his example will be followed 
to-morrow by a similar offer from Mr. Wickham. Tell 
Harding my indictment, as appears from a printed copy 
sent to me this evening, contains two counts ; the first for 
levying war against the United States on the 10th of December, which will be attempted to be supported by the 
perjured evidence of Taylor and Albright, of resistance 
made to General Tupper's arresting me ; while Tupper 
will prove he never attempted to arrest me, or any of the 
party ; for which insolent behavior of his, bye-the-bye, 
it is rumored that he is threatened also with a State pros 
ecution. The other count is for planning, and going 
down the river on the llth, to effect the seizure of New 
Orleans, which I suppose the evidence of the Hendersons 
is chiefly relied upon to maintain ; but this testimony I 
shall also, I expect, be able to defeat; also, let him know 
or read that in filling many of the blank spaces with my 
name, which occurs several times, an e is uniformly used 
in the Christian name, instead of an a, as I have ever 
written it, and in the surname an a is as often used as 
an e. I want to learn from him whether any, and what, 
advantages may be taken of these variances, and when ? 

To return to my visitors D. Wbodbridge and Edmond 
Dana called in the morning, both my friends, by whom I 
heard Joe had safely given all the papers I charged him 
with to Col. Gushing. A great deal of property has been 
sold, I hear, but the purchasers are friendly enough to offer 
to let me have it, by placing them as they were before the 
sales. No negroes are sold, but all are vagrant and latitant ; 
still none will be lost. The laws of Virginia and Kentucky 
only allow an absent debtor or defendant to come in 
within seven years, and set aside, or seek redress for a 
sale made against law or equity. Again, it seems as if 
every one I ever knew, and more, were now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> ; 
for to-day the prosecuting counsel had about one hundred 
witnesses called in court, and, for the second time, put off 
the trial for two days, because about fifty more did not 
appear ; and nothing less than Morgan Neville and Bob 
Robison were here this evening. 

Friday, 8 o'clock, A. M. I was a little indisposed yes 
terday, which, with the hinderance of company, etc., pre 
vented my writing. A small dose of ipecac, has to-day 
restored my strength and appetite, so that I hope I have 
already surmounted whatever seasoning may have been 
necessary to fit me for the sojourn I shall make in this 
place. Mr. Wickham, as was expected, waited upon me, 
with Mr. Botts ; these, with Mr. Randolph, all three my 
gratuitous counsel, I severally and distinctly assured, no 
apprehension of a capital conviction, or sentence of death, 
could induce me to draw from the sympathies and exigencies of my family to defray any charge of my defense, 
either at present or any after period I could contemplate. 
Mr. "W., a staunch Federalist, and Messrs. Randolph and 
Botts, perhaps as warm Democrats, are of opinion I shall 
be enlarged on Col. Burr's acquittal of the treason charge, 
if I can procure bail for the misdemeanor, which I sup 
pose I could easily do, but would as soon remain where I 
am, until all the claims of Government upon me are dis 
posed of. It will much depend on the progress and turn 
of Burr's trial, when mine can come on, though our cases 
will be kept as wide apart as truth and their merits justly 
require. It is truly painful to me to tell you to expect 
nothing from the Island, though most of the purchasers, 
even Miller, the principal, would return the property on 
the terms I have before mentioned ; yet the recovery of 
any thing depends on his acceptance of the best and only 
arrangements Alston can make. Alston is endeavoring to 
raise money here to meet all the demands, the success of 
which I shall learn to-day or to-morrow, but little depend 
upon. On failure of this, he, Alston, will assume the 
whole, payable one-half a year from next January, the 
remainder the January following, with interest. The 
impossibility, he declares, to raise money in Carolina, by 
sale or mortgage, and his having fewer negroes than his 
estates require, make this the best arrangement he can 
make ; but which, I fear, will not be accepted. I will 
endeavor to learn and effect the speediest means of for 
warding to you as many of the negroes as possible, 
which, I suppose, you will hire out ; but, in all your 
affairs, be Harding your guide. 

Alston talks confidently of Burr's recovering his demands upon Government, to the amount of 50,000. 
This event would be prosperous, indeed, but I have little 
faith in it. Mercer has sat an hour with me since last 
sentence ; news to-day by him is all war, traced up to 
declarations by the President, that the ground the Gov 
ernment will take is the inviolability of a neutral flag ; 
every one is in arms, to be ready on the first signal to 
take Quebec and the West Indies. Mercer prays you to 
accept the admiring homage of his remembrance ; I send 
my letters for you, by arrangement with him under cover 
to his friend B. Taylor, Esq., attorney- at-law, Alexandria, 
who will duly forward them to Scott. You will also 
inclose to the same gentleman, who will forward your 
letters to me through Mr. Mercer. I have just received a 
tender of friendship by Mr. Ormsby, of Kentucky, from 
General Henry Lee, and offers of soups, jellies, etc., from 
Mrs. Carrington, with their compliments.

To Blennerhassett. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, August 16th. 

Your first letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> has just come to hand, 
and, notwithstanding the predictions of your former one, 
I do n't find it by any means so melancholy as the first I 
received, as it assures me of your accommodations in that 
place (which I can neither bear to repeat or write) to be much better than I expected. I also feel now, that in 
such a court as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, absolute falsehoods can't pass, 
when, in opposition to all that can be sworn to by Wood 
county, you have the most respectable witnesses from the 
State of Ohio ; and surely every person in Belpre* can 
testify that Tyler's boats landed on the Jsland in noon 
day, and had no arms on board, and admitting that what 
all these villains said were true, how were you concerned 
in what was done by Tyler or others ? Ashley has told 
Mr. Harding that Peter Taylor said something that in 
jures you ; and Col. Burr writes in his letter to Harding, 
which I have seen, that " Mr. Blennerhassett has injured 
him, both by what he has said and what he has written." 
Good God ! what a world this is : tell Col. Burr, from 
me, if you think it worth while, that I wanted not thia 
aggravation to my unhappiness ; at least, that I looked 
not for aggravations from him. He also writes to tell 
you to place your family with Mrs. Alston : tell him were 
Mrs. Alston only in question, I would now, this moment, 
without hesitation, take refuge with her, and that I 
should not think my life even worth its present value, did 
not I hope once more to see and converse with that 
woman whom I think almost above human nature ; but 
I would at the same time do nothing that might lessen 
the dignity of the attachment I feel for her. 

We are under the greatest obligations to Doctor Commins, for carrying your package, which you will receive 
sooner than you could any other way. 

I believe, from what I have learned, that Tyler will 
injure you, if he can ; he is by this time arrested. Now 
let me again intreat you to spare no costs that can serve 
you ; if our negroes come down from the Ohio, I repeat 
again, we can make a good beginning here. Capt. Percy 
has been here again, urging me to go to the Spanish 
dominions, where you will be well received, and where I 
shall make a visit, when I know the termination of your 
prosecution. I spent three days at Col. Scott's since I 
wrote the letter you will receive with this. You may 
perceive my spirits are much mended ; but I am still determined to adhere to what I then said I would, in case the 
perjury of the mob should prevail ; though every con 
versation I hear on the subject tends to encourage me, at 
least with regard to yourself. I shall write every mail to 
assure you of the health of myself and the boys. 

Farewell for another week ! remember that your family are well, and that you are adored by your 

M. BLENNERHASSETT.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, Aug. 2Gth, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

My usual depression of spirits has been much increased 
by not having received any letter from you by this mail, 
aided by the shock of hearing from Ashley to-day, for the 
first time, that it was by the perjury of Peter Taylor that 
a bill was found against you. 'T is true, I feel fully confident such evidence must be done away with ; but I also 
feel, that it is owing to this alone that you are in your 
present situation, the thoughts of which haunt me night 
and day. Gracious God ! confined in a prison in the dogdays, and by the perjury of a wretch not many degrees 
from a brute ! I used to give him credit for the utmost 
honesty; but it is in vain, I am convinced more and 
more every day, to expect principle without some refinement, at least where interest is concerned. Ashley says 
he hears they have given the wretch a tract of land some 
where. If this can be proved, it will be sufficient. As 
for Albright, I can make oath to his secreting our two 
negroes, who ran away when you left the Island ; and 
Elmwood, the blacksmith, told me of his taking stolen 
melons and sweet potatoes to Marietta to sell for negro 
Jim, whom he saw steal them out of the field, where 
there were no others but mine. I see plainly enough, the 
Wood county rabble only want some pretext to vindicate 
their plunder; but I feel great confidence in the evidence 
I trust you will have from Marietta and Belpre*, and 
hope no lawyers' fees will be spared. "Why can't I be 
with you ? But I feel it would not do ; your mind is 
stronger without me, and the boys are an insurmountable 
objection to my going round, which I should only do in 
a case that I hope can't possibly happen. 

I have only been to Mrs. Scott's since I heard of your 
arrest, and shall probably not go anywhere until I learn 
the result. Miss Percy is still with me. Major T., who 
visits me often, begs to be kindly remembered to you. 
Dr. Commins left home, I believe, three days ago, for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, where he was called as a witness by Government. He took with him all the papers, etc., you wrote 
for from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, but I suppose this will reach you 
first, though he went through the wilderness and took a 
pack-horse. 
The boys are well, and still, thank God ! insensible of 
your situation, though they often pierce me to the heart 
by their questions about you, and threaten very often, 
when I correct them, to " tell their pappy how bad I 
am.'* They both of them join in sending, to use their 
own phrase, " their good love to their dear pappy." 

I wish, when your mind is fully disengaged from your 
present embarrassments, that you would make a thorough 
calculation of the profits and losses between this country 
and the one we have left. Perhaps you may sell the 
Island ; if you can do so, it will be best ; if not, nothing 
but a certain loss would prevent my wish of returning 
there. My attachment for that place is strong indeed, 
but not so strong as to entirely counterbalance our interest ; at the same time, I would have you consider there is 
only one thing in favor of this country the raising of cot 
ton which for a moment gives it any preference ; for, in 
spite of all you may have heard, it is a sickly country, 
both for black and white. Intermitting fever is inevitable ; both the children have had it, but Harman's was 
the worst; he was completely cured by Dr. S., with 
whom I am much delighted as a physician. Dominick 
was then attacked, but I stopped the progress of the dis 
order myself. I am told Bayou Sara is much more 
healthy generally than the vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, where 
fevers are constant ; and from this statement of the sickness of this country I leave you to judge how far it will 
agree with your constitution. As to mine, I believe it is 
impossible I ever should have an "intermittent;" I only 
suffer at times from the pain in my breast, which uniformly increases in proportion to the anxiety of my mind. 
I grow very thin, notwithstanding my appetite is good; 
but I believe nobody's mind ever had more influence on 
the body than mine, but do n't let this concern you ; all I 
suffer now will only tend to make me completely happy, 
on your delivery from your present situation, which, I 
begin to think, must take place soon. 'T is not possible 
you can be injured by the perjury of such complete 
fools. 

The cotton crop promises very badly on account of the 
drought, in all the land about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> ; but wherever the 
land is new, the drought does not affect it. Now let me 
urge you to weigh well the advantages and disadvan 
tages of this country, and let your mind be no way influenced by what you have thought of the society of the 
place. It is not what I at first supposed it ; and any way, 
I consider it scarce a feather in the scale. If you can sell 
the Island, do n't hesitate to do so ; if not, consider that 
while we are making money here we are losing it by 
the house going to rack, and the land lying idle there ; 
whereas, if we can keep up that place, it, with the in 
crease of our negroes, will be enough for the boys ; 
then, on the other hand, if we go to Bayou Sara and 
plant cotton for four or five years, we may, at the end 
of that time, be enabled to go to the Northern States. 
Consider well what I have said, and remember that, at 
all events, your happiness is the first object with your 

M. BLENNERHASSETT.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, YA., Sept. l~Lth, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

A few days have elapsed since I might have written to 
you to announce the second event that rendered last 
Monday remarkable as a day on which I might he sup 
posed to have "been elated with the long desired change 
of my condition for the better. That was the termination of my imprisonment, by the abandonment on the 
part of the prosecutors of the indictment against me for 
treason, and my admission to bail, under the other indictment for a misdemeanor. But the receipt of your letter 
of the 3d ultimo, by a speedy arrival, was the event 
which constituted the first blessing that day returned to 
so many hopes and prayers offered up to obtain it. I 
have since received, I believe, all your other letters from 
Marietta, though your negligence in omitting dates dis 
tresses me, as I am ignorant of any time which I can con 
nect with any thing you tell me of yourself, the boys, or 
our friends. I am delighted with the profiles. It would 
cost you more calculation than you will ever enter upon 
to discover the one-hundredth part of the lines, or parts 
of lines and curves, on which I shall rapturously specu 
late in these bits of paper. You know it is not my tem 
per to feel surprise or emotion on transition from one 
extreme to another. I therefore passed from imprisonment to liberty with the same unconcern with which you 
have sometimes observed me to take the air, after three 
days voluntary confinement. But this may be more ex 
plicable from some daily notes I have kept for you since 
my arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. Our ingenious Harding will 
not be a little surprised to learn from you, that after a 
deprivation of liberty for fifty-three days, I was freed 
from the treason case, on which I had been arrested at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, without arraignment, and shall probably get 
clear of the misdemeanor case in the same way, by the 
success of six similar points, which will be decided, I 
expect to-morrow, by the court, in favor of Burr. So 
you see I have little prospect of an opportunity to speak 
in my own cases, especially as I am so well provided with 
counsel. Still there is a chance of my being here put on 
trial for the misdemeanor, or being involved in the issue 
of a motion to send us to the Kentucky district for trial, 
in either of which events I shall say something. 

I have had two dollars worth of letters forwarded 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> : first, from Ireland ; two from Mar 
tin, one telling me to inquire after an estate he thinks 
has fallen to me of 6,000 a year, by the death of 
Lord Eoss, ci-devant Oxmantown, and Captain Jones, 
in the "West Indies, next to whom I stand in the entail. 
I do not wish you to build at all on this intelligence, 
though it is not at all improbable it may be realized. 
Should that ever happen, in how many instances may our 
gratitude do justice, in fact, to our dispositions. I hope 
I shall within a week re-open the small credit our nar 
row funds will entitle us to in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Lewis has 
already written to me, to say he will endeavor to have 
every bill taken up his house had rejected, that he can 
come at. I board with Major Smith, at a comfortable 
house, as cheap as we can, i. e., at seven dollars a week 
each, but shall proceed to Marietta as soon as I am dis 
charged from the court., as I do not expect any attempt, if made for our transmissal to another district, will pre 
vail. Do, however, continue to write hither until other 
wise advised. 

I can add little more by this mail than to say, I am not 
sufficiently satisfied you can so surely he healthy where 
you are, in the fall, as if you were six or seven miles from 
the river. Therefore, on the earliest threatening to your 
self or the hoys of any autumnal attack, I entreat and 
enjoin you to let nothing prevent your removal. 

It would be impossible to enumerate all our excellent 
and accomplished friends ; still more so to say the hun 
dredth part of what my gratitude would express to them 
for their generous attention to you. You will acquit me 
of this duty with every one of them as well as you can. 
I wrote to Harding, who I hope will long enjoy his and 
Winthrop's good health. Colonel and Mrs. Scott, Mrs. 
"Whittle, and friends, have, with many others, claims 
upon my grateful regards that will never be obliterated. 
Your husband, HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. I will endeavor to execute so much of your wishes 
as time and circumstances will permit.

I write this by Col. McKee, who leaves town to-day for 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> ; though, from occasional interruptions he expects 
in his journey, you may not get it until after one or two 
other letters of more advanced date may reach you by post 
It will, however, serve to quiet your anxiety for my delay 
in arriving at Xatchez, as that pleasure must give way to 
the control of contingencies I can not govern. This day 
all the evidence is closed on the motion now before the 
court, for our transmissal to Kentucky ; the debates will 
end, and the motion be refused, I have every reason to 
believe, by Saturday ; but, in that event, I shall be detained, three or four days, to put my demands on Col. 
Burr on some footing of adjustment ; after which I pro 
pose to use all diligence I can to haste to Marietta, from 
whence, I fear, I shall find great difficulty in effecting the 
recovery and removal of the negroes. I can not teaze 
you with particulars of my expectations ; I may have to 
go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> or South Carolina, and, possibly, not 
be able to descend the river until after it shall break up in 
the latter part of January. You must economize in the 
mean time, and seek all the resources you can draw from 
the friends who surround you. I will write again by 
Tuesday's post; I have not cared to risk many letters, as 
you see weekly by the papers, or must conclude, I am 
every day before the court. I wish you to be very 
reserved in all your communications, except with Hard 
ing, whom I wonder you have not mentioned in every 
letter I received from you. I had none since Sunday's 
mail, and since the news of our boy's sickness, by yours 
of 25th August ; I am truly miserable in my alarms for 
my Harman, whose situation, as well as your own, with 
regard to the pain in your breast, I can see you have im 
parted to me with reluctance and reserve. 

Perhaps we shall yet enjoy ease and wealth, if Martin's 
expectations of my succeeding to the estates of the late 
D. Harman, by the death of Lord Oxmantown, and Capt. 
Jones, shall be realized ; therefore, I only beseech Heaven 
to inspire you with the same prospects of contentment 
and delight with which I can enjoy the remainder of my 
days in a cottage with you and our boys God grant I 
am warranted to add them. Assure Dr. S. of perfect 
esteem and confidence in his talents and learning, and 
cultivate the opportunities of his closest attendance upon 
yourself and the boys. I have no news by this opportunity ; 
it is uncertain and precarious. Adieu ! 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. I hope Harding has not missed hearing that J. 
S. Lewis, in his individual capacity, will honor bills, 
drawn for your necessities, to the amount of $500.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, VA., Oct. I9th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This day's mail, my beloved, brought me your double 
letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and Col. Ellis's, of the 3d and 8th 
ult., though I see, by the Washing-ton postmark, it did 
not leave that office before the 15th. You have not, I 
find, been spared by the climate. Well, I trust in the 
favor of Heaven for the full re-establishment of your 
health, through the same mercy to me that has granted 
your recovery. My misery has been severe, from not 
having heard from you for three weeks back. During 
my anxiety for the cause of my disappointment, I attrib 
uted the latter to a relapse of Harman's sickness, which 
much distressed me. There is certainly a Providence 
which ordains, in compassion of our weaknesses, that we 
shall sometimes dread calamities far less than that it is 
pleased to conceal from us. But why do you permit your 
concern for me to weaken your strength or deject your 
spirits ? you might conclude from the papers, the worst 
that can befall me is the loss of three or four months' 
detention from you. To-morrow, I expect we will all be 
discharged ; after which nothing shall retard my return 
to you, but the care I must give to your property and 
affairs. Why fret about what you regard without due 
consideration, the disappointment of that confidence you 
have heedlessly placed in mankind ? What claim could 
your merits have upon the envy of upstart's ? Is not the 
sincere attachment of two or three friends of more value 
than the momentary and lying attentions of the crowd ? 
But why dwell as you do upon the Island ? Have you 
forgotten Marietta and Wood county, or can you regen 
erate them ? or, if we should succeed to 6,000 or 7,000 
a year, by the decease of Lord Oxmantown, etc., would 
you bury it with ourselves on the Island ? Compose your 
self, therefore, till we meet, if it should not be these six 
months ; if we should still prefer a cabin near Fort 
Adams, but six miles from the Mississippi swamp, where 
none of us, please God, need fear to encounter the climate. 
I rejoice to learn that you find a new friend to replace 
some old ones, who have not . stood the test. If H. has 
not sunk the man in the merchant, he will prove a 
brilliant exception to Harding's rule, pronounced against 
the influence of mercantile habits and obscure birth. It 
will be no consideration with him, that we may yet draw 
for his indemnity upon other funds than our grateful 
hearts. Harding's own rule will preserve him steadfast ; 
but you should not mention to any living person the 
pecuniary prospects opened to us, were it only the better 
to enable us to prove the hearts of others, but also be 
cause it may not be realized. 

It will not surprise you to learn that I have had unsolicited offers of horses and money, which I have declined. ~No 
less than three Irishmen have come forward in this way ; 
namely, Jas. O'Hennessey, a Kerry-man, who never spoke 
to me until he rode hither, 105 miles to see me ; Mr. Pat. 
Hendren, a lawyer, in easy circumstances, settled thirty 
miles from hence ; and Mr. Pierce Butler, whom I have 
never seen, who resides in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, is very wealthy, 

and has made an unlimited offer through D . Mr. 

Chevallie'r lent me 1,000 to-day, to send to a negro sale, 
which I have not used, and shall return untouched ; and, 
while I was confined in the Penitentiary, General H. Lee 
offered me similar aid through a friend. Thus we find a 
few choice spirits to compensate for the inconstancy of 
false friends. May they reconcile us to the world. 
I have only written one letter by mail since I left the 
Penitentiary. I missed two post-days through my attendance on the court, or some other unavoidable occupation ; 
but I confided two letters for you to private conveyance, 
by Strickland and Col. McKee ; if you have not already 
discontinued writing to me at this place, you will do so 
from the time this reaches you. I shall possibly go to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> before I see the Ohio ; if so, 
I shall accompany Burr to one or the other, in a day or 
two. I forbear to trouble you with my motives until I 
can impart the result. 

Our long-protracted contest with the Government has 
blasted "Wilkinson's fame and credit, never to be revived, 
though the investigations may not exhibit Burr's character or designs unequivocally immaculate. But my name 
has so regularly met your eye in the papers weekly, that 
it was unnecessary to detail particulars ; you would, of 
course, conclude I was daily present in court. As to my 
health, I never enjoyed better ; though I had two or three 
slight illnesses while in confinement, I have since recov 
ered much more flesh than I lost there. 

Tuesday, 20th. Since writing the above, yesterday 
evening, I had a pretty long consultation with Burr, the 
result of which is a more probable conjecture that I shall 
go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> with him, to try his success there in 
raising some money for me. I will write frequently to 
advise you of my movements. I have no words to ex 
press my feelings for Kitty Perry's kindness. I hope we 
shall ever retain her attachment. 

Your husband, H. BLENNERHASSETT. 
For various reasons, which it is not necessary here to 
enumerate, the trials of Burr, Blennerhassett, Dayton, 
John Smith of Ohio, Comfort Tyler, Israel Smith of ]S"ew 
York, and Davis Floyd, were postponed, from time to time, 
until the third of August. From the fifth until the seven 
teenth of the month , the court was engaged in obtaining a 
jury for the trial of Burr, and discussing points of law. 

Never before, in the history of the country, was wit 
nessed so grand a display of legal acumen and forensic 
talent. Upon the bench sat the venerated Marshall, spot 
less in purity, and, for soundness of judgment, without 
an equal. Calm, dignified, and attentive, he analyzed the 
arguments of counsel, and noted their relevancy with the 
nicety of a critic. At the bar was Wirt, whose fervid and 
soul-thrilling eloquence, even on this very trial, placed 
him at once among the first of American orators. With 
a brilliancy of imagination which startled his auditors, 
he swayed the minds of the jury with wonderful effect. 
There, too, was Martin, who had been previously distinguished, in the trial of Judge Chase, before the United 
States Senate. Every word that he uttered, like a twoedged sword, pierced the arguments of his opponents at 
every point. There was Hay ; always ready to take ad 
vantage of suspicious circumstances, and wield them, 
with tenfold force, against the prisoner. There was Ran 
dolph, slow, calculating, and careful; building up the 
vulnerable points of his case against the attacks of his 
adversaries. There was Botts, facetious and playful; 
sometimes descending to the ludicrous, but often rising, 
with convincing argument, to the grand. There was 
Wickham, dignified and commanding; taking up his 
subject with a master hand, and holding it to view, in 
every conceivable light. And there, too, was Burr, 
proudly pre-eminent, in point of intelligence, to his breth 
ren of the bar. He had been the Yice-President of the 
United States. He was accused of the highest and darkest crime in the criminal code. He stood before the su 
preme tribunal of his country, with the eyes of the 
nation gazing upon him. In the opinion of many, he 
was already condemned. He had the talent and tact, 
and the resources of the government, to contend against. 
Every faculty of his mind was exerted in his own defense. 
The magnitude of the charge ; the number of persons in 
volved; the former high standing and extraordinary 
fortunes of the accused, had excited an interest in the 
community, such as never before had been known. The 
witnesses against him were mostly officers of the Government, with whom, at one time or another, he had been in 
some way connected. 

For twenty-six days, the court was arduously engaged in 
the investigation of the offense. The evidence of sixty witnesses had to be examined and noted. Meanwhile, there 
being no suitable quarters in the city, Burr was confined 
in the Penitentiary, in the suburbs of Eichmond. Every 
day he was matched into court, on foot, escorted by a body 
guard of two hundred men, which would have done honor 
to an eastern prince. On the first of September, the jury 
returned a verdict u that Aaron Burr is not proved to 
be guilty, under the indictment, by any evidence submitted 
to us ; we, therefore, find him not guilty" Burr objected 
to the verdict, as being incorrect in point of form, and 
asked that the same might be given in the usual way 
simply, " Not Guilty." Mr. Hay answered, that, in fact ? 
it was a verdict of acquittal ; and that it should be entered in the jury's own words. 

"There was no precise form of words by which the 
jury should be governed." 

" They have no right to return a written verdict at 
all," replied Burr ; " they have no right to depart from 
the usual form." He then called for the recital of the 
common directions given the jury by the clerk. They 
were read, and end as follows : 

" If you find him guilty, you are to say so : if not 
guilty, you are to say so, and no more" 

" The jury can not be indulged," said Burr. " They 
have defaced a paper belonging to the court, by writing 
upon it words which they have no right to write. They 
ought to be sent back." After a short consultation, it 
was agreed that the simple verdict of " Not Guilty " 
might be entered on the records of the court. 

On the ninth of September, Burr was again arraigned, 
upon an indictment for a misdemeanor, which consisted 
of seven counts ; the substance of which was, that Aaron 
Burr did set on foot a military enterprise, to be carried 
on against the territory of a foreign prince, viz., the prov 
ince of Mexico, which was within the territory of the King 
of Spain, with whom the United States were at peace. 

After the prosecution had examined some of their wit 
nesses, and the court had decided that the testimony of 
others was not relevant, the District Attorney made a 
motion to discharge the jury. To this motion Burr 
objected; insisting upon a verdict. This was on the fif 
teenth of the month. The court, being of opinion that 
the jury could not, in this stage of the case, be discharged, 
without the consent of the accused, they accordinglyretired, and very soon returned with a verdict of " Not 
Guilty."

To Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, VA., Oct. 22d, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Ashley offers a desirable opportunity of informing you 
of the effect of the final order -of the court here, which 
is, that Burr and myself are to be tried at Chillicothe, on 
the first Monday in next January, for a misdemeanor. I 
speak of the effect, because it is generally understood the 
Government will drop all further proceedings. The judge 
has given this as his private opinion off the bench. Hay 
has expressed the same belief; and all further ideas of 
prosecuting for treason must be at an end, as the judge, 
in giving his opinion yesterday, declared no ground was 
laid before him, by the evidence, to entertain a suspicion 
of an overt act, having been committed, which was essential in making out the charge, though he thought proof 
enough had been exhibited of a treasonable design. It is 
therefore probable the recognizance I entered into yester 
day with Doctor Commins and Major Smith, my securi 
ties for my appearance at Chillicothe, will in the end be 
of no other use than to enlarge the records of the court. 

Thus, you perceive, I shall probably never again be a 
prisoner, and will not be prevented from descending the 
river, before it closes, if I do not learn, by intelligence 
expected from the President the day after to-morrow, 
through the Attorney-general, that Government intends 
to abandon all further proceedings against us. 
I think I shall go with " B." from hence, on Saturday, 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, four days journey thither, and a stay of 
three or four days there will leave me a full month for 
my journey to Marietta, the transacting of whatever business I can finish in that quarter, and getting under way 
afloat. 

I will write a line, through the Federal city, to apprise 
you of my freedom from further probable molestation 
by Government, or obstruction in my journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, 
where I hope to arrive, not far from New- Year's day. 
One way or the other, I am very anxious this information should reach you before you misconstrue or brood 
upon the statements you see in the papers of A. Burr and 
myself, being here committed, or sent off to Ohio. My 
chief object in going to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> is, to arrange my 
pecuniary demands upon A. B., though only in the prospect of securing them, and to raise by the friendships of 
Mr. Butler, or Joe Lewis, as much cash as will enable me 
to purchase a dozen slaves, whose hire or labor may give 
us subsistence until we learn the result of our expectations from Ireland, and support our independence after 
they may fail. I will dispatch my letter through the 
Federal city this evening, but will not close this before 
to-morrow, to collect further intelligence for you. 

All friends of the Chief Justice here are as much dissat 
isfied with his opinion yesterday as Government has 
been with all his former decisions. He is a good man, 
and an able lawyer, but timid and yielding under the 
fear of the multitude, led, as it were, by the vindictive 
spirit of the party in power. But you will console your 
self in the assurance of my wanting nothing, through the 
support of many friends. And should my obligations, 
under my recognizance, prevent my return to you, as I 
had hoped above, you must yet weather it out, without 
attempting a voyage or a journey which, instead of 
hastening our meeting, would possibly, at this season, 
prevent it forever, in this world. 

October 23d. I shall be off to-morrow or next day, 
with Dr. Commins, etc. He and myself are endeavoring 
to procure some negroes in partnership, upon part credit, 
but I can't answer for our success. I have no hopes of 
learning here, as I expected, the designs of J. ; but if 
they are hostile, I shall find means of effecting my 
wishes, of which I have little doubt. Endeavor with 
Capt. P. to procure us a lodging in his neighborhood; 
it may be very convenient. You will hereafter learn the 
motives of this suggestion, but I shall write more fully 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 

Saturday, 24A. I leave this at 5 o'clock to-morrow 
morning, in company with Dr. Commins ; Burr and L. 
Martin follow next day. I shall stop a day at the 
Federal city, to learn the disposition of Government, 
where I have no doubt I shall obtain a release from all 
further demands upon me in a criminal way : but. if I am 
not certified of this, I shall not yet be bereft of resources 
to meet and indemnify you, in as reasonable a space of 
time as you should expect. I have more to do to-night 
than will give me half sleep. Farewell! I will write 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, if not sooner. 

Your faithful husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, YA., Aug. 4^, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

WE set out as usual from Scottsville before day, rode twelve miles to breakfast, then proceeded to T 's, 
eight miles on our way, where we rested one hour in ex 
cessive heat; afterward, proceeded to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, where 
we arrived at forty-five minutes past 2, P. M. Distance 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, 564 miles. From T ? s, Mr. Meade sent a note to Major Scott, the federal Marshal for the 
district of Virginia, to inform him of our approach. We 
traveled this last stage as usual, until we got within 
three-quarters of a mile of Manchester, where Mr. Meade 
left us, at a turnpike gate, and rode off at a quick pace. 

Now Capt. took the command of the party, and said to me that it would be proper to observe some order ; 
to which I answered, I had no objection. He then ordered 
Mr. Morton, the High Sheriff of Kentucky, and Mr. Wil 
lis Morgan, to form a file in front, Mr. McCally and Mr. 
David Todd to form another in the rear, directing me to 
ride single between the files, while he took his station in 
front of the whole ; in this order he led the escort with 
the Drisoner, in an easy walk, under a broiling sun, over 
a road in which I was almost suffocated by the dust, 
owing to a long drought with which the country seemed 
to have been affected, and a smart breeze in our rear. 
During this embarrassment I called to the gentlemen in 
front of me to observe, " that I supposed it was not necessary those in the rear should ride so close to me." They 
did so, probably, from the Captain's having used the 
words " % close order " in forming the procession. Those 
in front, however, Mr. Morton, or Mr. Morgan, answered 
me in the negative ; upon which the rear file fell back a 
few paces. We continued still in the same order, in which 
I endeavored to keep my station, as was assigned me, as 

nearly as possible, until we drew near to M bridge, 

over James river, when the Captain left his station in the 
front and rode back to the rear, I suppose to order them 
to ride closer up, for they immediately afterward did so. 
We now reached the bridge, on which the Captain shook 
hands with Col. Meyo, en passant, and telling him one of 
the gentlemen in the rear would pay the toll, which Mr. 
Todd did very expeditiously, without much deviation 
from his station. We proceeded at the same gait, until 
we entered the Main-street, commonly called the Brickrow, where I was disappointed to see no particular notice 
taken of the party, except by a little boy, who called out 
to some of his comrades, " 0, see the troop of horse, but 
they have forgot their colors ! " The walking gait was 
still preserved until we got in sight of the Washington 
tavern, when the Captain was pleased to trot up to the 
house, in which pace we followed him as closely as possi 
ble. On alighting from my horse, I was welcomed by 
Mr. Meade, in the presence of many gentlemen standing 
in the portico. He then asked me to go up stairs, ordered 
dinner, etc., after which he delivered me into the custody 
of the Deputy Marshal of the Virginia district, by whom 
I was conducted in a carriage to the Penitentiary, Mr. 
Meade and the Captain accompanying me. In the evening I was visited by Mr. Alston, Mr. Mercer and Mr. 
Randolph; the latter having obligingly tendered me his 
services and advice as a lawyer. Here my apartments 
are large and convenient, but very warm, from the hight 
of the windows preventing a free admission of air. The 
Deputy Marshal, on taking charge of me, read a warrant 
by Judge Marshall, but refused to leave it, or a copy, 
with me. 

"WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I slept until 7 o'clock ; had a light breakfast this morning from the tavern ; hired a servant at $13 a month, by 
the week, he finding himself; was visited by Mr. Julian 
Dandridge, with whom I used to assist here, seven years 
ago, at the Harmonic Society; by Prichard, the book 
seller, whose hospitality I remember then to have re 
ceived, and who tendered me his best services, reminding 
me of some pecuniary accommodation I had conferred 
upon him, which I had forgotten. Visited again by Mr. 
Alston, who brought me a letter from Col. Burr ; also, by 
Dudley Woodbridge, jun., Edmond Dana, with letters from 
Miller and Col. Gushing, by Mr. John Banks, who re 
minded me of my gold chronometer in his possession, and 
by Mr. Craughton, who conferred great civilities on me 
seven years ago at Fredericksburg, and now warmly tendered me his best services. Mr. Alston repeated orally 
20 
to me the necessity Col. Burr observed in his letter for 
my employing counsel, as the only proper intermedium 
of our communications. I assured him I was very de 
sirous of such aid, but was determined not to strengthen 
my defense, however disastrous the issue of it might 
prove, by drawing from the exigencies and sympathies of 
my family a single dollar to defray its charges. He still 
urged me to write a few lines to Mr. Botts, which I did. 
stating that I was solicitous of the aid of Mr. B.'s talents 
on terms I wished to propose to him in person. On Mr. 
B.'s appearance soon after in my room, I stated to him 
that Col. Burr and Mr. Alston had expressed a desire 
that I would employ him, though they were apprised of 
my determination not to spend a dollar on my defense, 
being a resolution the exigencies of my family imposed 
upon me, but Mr. Alston having assured me Col. Burr 
would arrange the matter with Mr. Botts, I wished Mr. 
B. to believe I should regard the aid of his talents on my 
trial as most beneficial to my interests, and flattering to 
my wishes. Mr. B. handsomely replied to me, by assuring 
me that he would think it dishonorable to withhold his 
professional aid from my inability to make him a pe 
cuniary compensation. I returned, that from the state 
of my aftairs that inability would probably be permanent, 
and again referred him to the contingency of Col. Burrs 
or Mr. Alston's remunerating him on my account, as well 
as on Col. Burr's, as it was in this view, and at their 
special instance I had given him the trouble of calling 
upon me, though I could sincerely assure him that, were I 
in circumstances to remunerate him in a degree proportional to the sense I entertained of his talents, etc., he 
would be one of the first counsel I should employ. Mr. 
B. seemed perfectly satisfied, and was pleased to say he 
would, with my leave, bring Mr. Wickham to see me, 
who, he was sure, would be happy to assist me in the 
same way with himself. I thanked this generous and 
enlightened stranger with all that awkward embarrassment with which the impetuosity of gratitude suffused 
my countenance, making every pore of my face an outlet 
to the flow of my heart, which found too narrow an issue 
at my mouth. It will soon appear how necessary it was 
to explain the occasion and manner of my interview with 
Mr. B. I took this opportunity to observe to Mr. Botts, 
that Mr. Edmond Randolph had last evening called upon 
me, and obligingly tendered his advice, by which I said I 
could not presume to suppose Mr. R. meant I should con 
sider him as my counsel, gratuitously engaged to defend 
me on my trial. Mr. Botts was in the act of taking leave 
when I made this remark to him, which prevented my 
distinctly understanding his reply. I was visited this 
evening by my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> escort, en masse, who took the 
opportunity to inspect the building and the armory, took 
their grog, and then took leave. Morton, who arrested 
me so rudely, while engaged in conversation with Mrs. 

Jourdan, and Miss Van P 1, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, endeavored, 

by the most assiduous attentions on the road, to repair 
that outrage, and now, I thought, exhibited in his coun 
tenance every concern for my situation. I find I have 
every liberty allowed me but that of passing from under 
this roof by day, or out of my room by night, the door 
being locked upon me at 8 o'clock, and opened at sunrise. 
I have got a supply of groceries and liquors ; my dinner 
is furnished by the tavern, and I have every prospect of 
living well. This evening I have inclosed various papers 
to Mr. Alston, showing him how my property has been 
sacrificed on the Ohio, and praying his aid to recover it 
for my children, by virtue of his responsibility for my 
indorsement of Col. Burr's protested bills. Continued 
my labors to comfort my poor wife, by another page of a 
close written letter, and went to bed at midnight. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Woke this morning with severe headache and general 
lassitude ; took a little breakfast, with no appetite. At 
10, A. M., took a small dose of medicine; repeated at 
noon ; had a long conversation with Alston, in which he 
expressed great concern for the embarrassments occa 
sioned me by my indorsements of the bills ; declaring 
that, for my sake, he would do any thing in his power, 
observing, however, that it was impracticable to raise 
money in South Carolina by sale or mortgage of lands ; 
that through his anxiety to have all the protested bills 
taken up, he now had a friend employed in this town, 
endeavoring to raise as much money as would cover all 
the demands ; that I shall learn the result to-day or to 
morrow, which, if successful, would remove all difficul 
ties. I proposed to him an alienation to me on some of 
the holders of the bills of some negroes to be sold at 
Katchez, where, I suggested, he might avail himself of 
the advance they would fetch upon their value in Caro 
lina, and by that means he would probably sink half the 
demands upon him; but after some consideration, he 
stated the value of slaves in Carolina full as high as it is 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>; and at last observed, that his estates needed 
more slaves for their cultivation than he owned. He 
offered, however, to assume all the demands upon me, if 
the creditors will accept one-half, payable with interest, 
next January twelvemonth ; the other half, etc., the 
January following. But my children's property is, and 
will be, irrevocably sacrificed in the mean time. 

Mr. A. next referred to a memorandum he had in his 
pocket of some inquiries to be made of me on the part of 
Col. Burr, of which two are remarkable: first, had I 
written, or would I write, to Emmett, to come to the 
trial ? second, in what instance did I intend, when I ob 
served to Mr. Edm. Randolph, that " Col. Burr had 
sometimes been too cautious ; sometimes, too little so ? " 
To the first I answered, " that I had no doubt Emmett's 
friendship for me would bring him hither to assist in my 
defense, if he thought I stood in need of him ; but as I 
was, on the one hand, determined to expend no money in 
my own defense, I was, on the other, equally averse to 
bringing my friend on a journey from his large family, or 
withdrawing his industry from that harvest on which 
alone that family depended for their support ; but could 
I engage Mr. Emmett at a suitable compensation, I would 
write to him forthwith." Mr. A. said, " his expenses 
should be paid." I replied, I could not say what Mr. 
Emmett might understand by the term expenses ; but I 
was sure he would never hand in an account of his 
tavern-bills or traveling charges. I must, therefore, at 
present, decline to disturb him. Mr. A. was now led by 
some association of ideas to remark, that Messrs. Randolph 
and Botts had signified to Col. Burr or himself, that, when 
they offered their professional services to me, I seemed 
rather to desire to decline them, or consider them as in 
trusive. This evening, Mr. Botts brought Mr. Wickham 
to my room, when I asked Mr. Botts " if he understood 
me in the sense Mr. Alston said he did ? " On the con 
trary, Mr. Botts declared he did not ; nor did he think 
Mr. Randolph did. Mr. Wickham added a few words in 
compliment of my candor, and said all three considered 
themselves voluntarily engaged, without any expectation 
of pecuniary compensation from me. In answer to the 
second inquiry, I informed Mr. Alston that in making 
use of the expressions reported to Col. Burr by Mr. Ran 
dolph, I alluded to no particular instances, but could 
easily cite some. I then instanced the confidence reposed 
by Mr. Burr in General Wilkinson, on which Col. Burr 
had known my opinion long since, and the committal of 
himself to Col. Morgan and sons, both as examples of 
defect of caution on his part, and was proceeding with 
equal ease to call up errors of an opposite nature (God 
knows, I know a hundred, both ways), when I was stop 
ped by Mr. A.'s shaking his head, expressing his assent 
to my remarks on Wilkinson, and interrupting me by 
saying : " Mrs. Blennerhassett had good reason for her 
opinion of Col. Morgan." I was the less scrupulous to 
enter explicitly upon these explanations for the satisfaction of Col. Burr and Mr. A., because I did not feel that 
Col. Burr had ever suffered as yet from any avoidable 
indiscretion of mine ; though I was likely to do so far 
more than I had done already by his errors. I suspected 
that he had sent Mr. Edm. Randolph to deliver me a lecture on caution ; and, above all, I should, least of all ex 
amples I could imagine, wish to emulate the caution Mr. 
A. has exhibited to the world. Him, therefore, I re 
garded as the most improper organ of Col. Burr's wishes ; 
nor was I yet without another motive. I had occasion to 
inform Mr. A., when on the subject of the protested bills, 
that Mr. Barton, who had had an interview here with 
Col. Burr on that business, informed me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> 
that Col. Burr told him I was a bankrupt, not worth a 
dollar, or other words fully of the same import, which 
Mr. Barton protested he would, at any time or place, 
repeat and support. Bankrupt ! Hah ! Who made me 
so? God of retributive justice! That Col. Burr also 
declared to him that he did not believe Mr. Alston had 
executed any writing by which he, Alston, could be bound 
to me. "What ! did his memory, perhaps the most ener 
getic of all his talents, here lose its polish by the abrasion 
of his own calamities? Did he forget that he himself 
drafted that very paper, after having considered another 
which Mr. A. had written as insufficient ? But Mr. Bar 
ton has shown him a copy of the original, and he has 
probably recognized his own composition. 

Received some visits this evening ; could get no tea, 
because Mr. Douglas, the keeper, and Harwood, one of 
his assistants, were out, and another turnkey, with whom 
I had not yet got acquainted, would lock me up at night 
fall. Headache still continued. I went to bed about 10, 
being unable to write. 
FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Was visited by Mr. Mercer, who staid nearly one hour 
with me ; "begged, on the part of a lady unknown to me, 
who did not wish to have her name mentioned, I would accept of soups and jellies from her, if they were desired by 
my appetite or state of health. I told Mr. M. my gratitude impelled me to take a liberty with the lady, which I 
hoped her goodness would pardon. It was to engrave 
her name on the tablets of my heart, and enable my 
family to consecrate it in their regards. He then mentioned Mrs. Carrington. I prayed him to offer, in his 
own manner, a more just return of my sentiments than I 
could express. Soon after, Mr. Ormsby, of Louisville, 
Kentucky, called upon me to show me a letter signed 
H. L., directed to him by General Henry Lee, stating that 
he understood H. B., meaning myself, was friendless in 
this place, and tendering with warmth any services I 
might stand in need of. This offer I declined, charging 
Mr. 0. with a suitable verbal answer of grateful acknowl 
edgments to the General, of whom Mr. 0. cautioned me 
to beware in case of any dealing with him, at the same 
time acquainting me that the character of the General 
was, as I had long before been apprised, that of a man 
equally violent in his friendships and his enmities.' From 
the numerous instances of a violation of private confidence and public faith that have of late disgraced the 
Government and the country, by liberties that have been 
taken or permitted at the Post-offices, I procured, through 
the friendship of Mr. Mercer, the means of sending my 
letters and receiving those from my wife, through K. 
^Taylor, Esq., attorney at law, Alexandria. Closed a long 
letter to my wife, begun as long ago as Tuesday evening, 
on my arrival in this place. Began to brief my case for 
my counsel, of which I finished first folio. Have not 
seen or heard from Mr. Alston, or Col. Burr, to-day. 
Received the papers, and continued this journal until past 
midnight. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Overslept myself this morning. Spent more time than 
I could well spare in getting combed and shaved. Read 
the papers, the Federal one stating that they learn my 
arrival here ; that I speak confidently of my innocence, 
and desire a speedy investigation. Those on the other 
side, dropping the "Mister," mention my name in con 
formity to the style of the President; and his Wood 
county myrmidons insinuate that I was caught, as it 
were, fortunately in Kentucky, from which I was brought 
hither under guard, meaning, no doubt, like a felon or 
convict, as I should be. For to-day, my only visitor was 
Mr. Hendren, a lawyer, who resides in Charles City 
county, and has generously offered to come to town, and 
live at his own expense, whenever I will permit him to 
serve me. Mr. H. repeated assurances, which had before 
been made to me by Mr. John Banks and Mr. Ormsby, 
that the jury, not only so far as that part of the panel 
that was returned from "Wood county, but all the rest 
that completed it, from the body of the state, was grossly 
packed, with the exception of not more than two or three ; 
that Col. Burr and myself could not be too much on our 
guard, for he was persuaded that every Democrat, to a 
man, now in this town, was thirsting for our blood, and 
"John Jourdan," who has returned here to-day from 
Wood county, has told me this evening he has brought 
with him ample evidence of the most damning manoeu 
vres and intrigues that have been practiced in that quar 
ter. Say, Thos. Jefferson ! thou philanthropic messenger 
of peace and liberty to this favored country ! under thy 
administration, are these things unknown to thy tender 
heart, or are they the unhallowed doings of thy worthy 
and industrious partisans, to overcharge or adorn the can 
vass already burdened with the splendor of thy renown ? 
The papers will inform my friends of the progress and 
conduct of the trial of A. Burr ; but perhaps they may 
learn only from these notes, that the issue of it, "whether 
it prove serious or comical, will be the product of error 
in the grand jury that found the treason bills; for two of 
the most respectable and influential of that body, since it 
has been discharged, have declared they mistook the 
meaning of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion as to what 
sort of acts amounted to treason in this country, in the 
case of Swartwout and Ogden ; that it was under the influence of this mistake they concurred in finding such a 
bill against A. Burr, which otherwise would have prob 
ably been ignored. I am well to-day, and had a keen 
appetite at dinner ; soon after which, Jourdan stepped in, 
but with no particular news regarding my affairs on the 
Ohio. Saw Robinson and Mr. Simpson summoned with 
him, on the part of Col. Burr. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Visited by Prichard, at 9 o'clock, A. M. He stayed 
fully two hours, during which he confirmed many former 
accounts given me of the meanness and cowardice of Jef 
ferson's Attorney General, George Hay, whose insolence 
to poor Prichard, some years ago, occasioned P. to throw 
a plate at his head, which terminated the affair, and kept 
Mr. Attorney, ever after, within the bounds of civility. 
P. informed me, negroes now sell in this place at the 
same prices they could be bought at when I was here 
before, seven years ago. He has offered to get me a 
woman, aged about thirty years, with two sons, twelve 
and eight years old, belonging to his sister-in-law, for 
$500. Eh ! Mr. Alston, are negroes so much lower here 
than in South Carolina ? He has also promised to get 
me Molly's three children, two girls and a boy, if the 
owners will part with them, upon like reasonable terms 
as he thinks they will. After P. left me, I continued the 
briefing of my case for my counsel, and completed the 
third folio. If the prosecutors attempt again, to-morrow, 
to put off the trial to a fourth adjournment, I shall not 
think it unwarrantable to begin to suspect they fear to 
advance upon the ground they Ve taken, lest the mines 
of Mexico, or of Tartarus, be sprung upon them. This 
suspicion seems to be somewhat countenanced by the circumstance of their being correctly informed of the places 
where General Dayton has been for several days, and 
will continue, near this town, without the Marshal, who 
is certainly a vicious partisan, having yet made any 
attempt to disturb him ; while the once redoubted Eaton * 
has dwindled down in the eyes of this sarcastic town, 
into a ridiculous mountebank, strutting about the streets, 
under a tremendous hat, with a Turkish sash over colored 
clothes, when he is not tippling in the taverns, where he 
offers up with his libations the bitter effusions of his 
sorrows, in audibly bewailing to the sympathies of the 
bystanders " that he is despised by the Federalists, mis 
trusted by the Democrats, and hen I too long for his fame, 
"too long for his purse," "Quis talia fando temper et a 
lachrymis." 

General Dayton, however, I hear, will offer himself up 
to-morrow, or the next day, and will therefore live rentfree like myself, for some time ; but how far reasons of 
State may prevent my partaking of his society here, I can 
not yet tell. It is now 11 o'clock, P. M. I will walk 
about for some time with a fan, and then endeavor to 
sleep, to preserve my strength and appetite. 

MONDAY, AUGUST 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose at 6, A. M., dressed, and walked until 8. Had a 

call from Col. Q r, a violent Democrat, who calls 

every one " Tory " that is not of his own party, and 
talked a great deal about ruining England in the expected 
war with the United States. D. Woodbridge stepped in 
while I was at breakfast, and returned me in frames the 

two drawings presented me by Miss Yanpool at C , 

Col. Meade's place, near <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, the day I left that 
town under guard for this city. After Q ' r took leave, 
D. "Woodbridge informed me, he was told some time since 
by Col. Morgan, a subpoena had actually been dispatched, 
a fortnight past, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> for my wife, and he heard 
somebody say last evening, General Wilkinson had asserted the same thing. I immediately addressed a letter to 
Messrs. Randolph, "Wickham and Botts, stating this in 
telligence, and appealing to their feelings to vindicate, 
from this outrage of party, the rights of a wife and the 
fundamental principles of law and justice. Mr. Mercer 
called in as I was folding up the letter, and kindly took 
upon himself the charge of delivering it for me, as well 
as of inquiring at the Post-office for any letters he could 
bring me from thence. 

I had but half finished the last sentence but one, when 
I heard the voices of strangers coming up stairs, and Mr. 
Douglas entered my room with one of the Deputy Mar 
shals, to invite me to take an airing, that is, to attend the 
court. I was ready in three minutes, and on reaching 
the outside gate, perceived a carriage and two horseguards in waiting. I stepped in, found the air and exer 
cise very agreeable ; was told by the way, I should have 
the trouble to pass through a large crowd, to which I 
answered, " I was indifferent," and soon arrived at the 
capitol, where, without doors, I did not perceive near as 
many people as I expected; within, the court is .held in 
the Hall of the Assembly, which is spacious and hand 
some, and was pretty full at my entrance. I was first led 
by the Deputy Marshal below the bar ; soon after, some 
body else invited me to walk within it, pointing to a 
bench ; and again, I was directed to walk to the opposite 
side, directly in front of the Chief Justice's seat, where I 
sat down near a table at which Col. Burr's counsel sit. 
The court was not yet opened ; I was soon accosted, suc 
cessively, by Messrs. Randolph, Wickham and Botts, who 
all inquired, what occasioned my appearance in court ; I 
said I was ignorant, but supposed for arraignment. The 
counsel did not know I had been furnished three days 
ago with a copy of the indictment ; but I told them I had 
not yet received a list of the witnesses that might be 
called to testify against me, which I submitted to them, 
whether I was entitled to before arraignment. I then 
entered into a conversation, upon a hint from him in 
French, with Mr. Wickham, who, upon a first address to 
a stranger, possessed a talent of infusing into his manner 
an air of ease and friendly interest, that is truly adapted 
at once to engage the hearts of his acquaintance. Some 
considerable time after the court opened, it was engaged 
in a desultory way, with applications from jurors to be 
excused from serving on the trial of A. Burr, on various 
grounds, and excused. During such occupation, Col. 
Burr entered ; came over to that side where I was, shook 
me by the hand, and smilingly said, he was extremely 
glad to see me indeed. Observe, I had not before heard 
from him since Thursday. The prosecuting counsel 
seemed occupied with those of the defendant, A. Burr, in 
completing those lists of the witnesses, with the places 
of their abode, and agreeing upon some form of an ac 
knowledgment to be made by A. B., that he had been 
duly served with the same, for which the court was pa 
tiently waiting, when Mr. Hay coolly observed, " that it 
might, in the mean time, be as well to arraign Mr. Blennerhassett;" to which Mr. Botts objected, for want of 
preparation by me and my counsel. Mr. Hay replied, 
that if it was not done to-day, a great deal of time would 
be lost. Mr. B. said he could not help it, it would be im 
proper ; on which Mr. Hay returned, " that I might then 
be remanded," which I soon after solicited, from the 
warmth of the place and a wish to get back to my writ 
ing. I therefore left the court, having bowed to the 
bench, under charge of another Deputy Marshal, and 
another gentleman, with whom I returned hither on foot, 
much heated by the walk, about fifteen minutes past 2. 
Saw and saluted many faces on leaving the court ; among 
them, "Win. Lewis, who appeared glad to see me, and inquired particularly for my family ; also, David Wallace, 
who arrived yesterday. Dined with less appetite than I 
had yesterday ; oppressed in the evening by the heat of 
the weather ; tried to get cool, by walking and fanning, 
but was so weak I was obliged to lie down on the floor, 
where I slept, I know not how long, until I was awak 
ened by the name of Mrs. Alston, at which I started up, 
as if electrified, and perceived a servant of hers with a 
large present of oranges, lemons and limes. Wrote her, 
in form of a card, three lines of devotion and gratitude, 
seizing the opportunity of inquiring after Alston, who is 
confined to the house, to pray her to let me hear again 
from her to-morrow. Drank tea as usual, at nightfall, 
and was soon after locked up. Through excessive heat, 
I have written the sixth folio of my brief, and will now 
try to sleep, it being 2 o'clock, the llth. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose late. Saw Jourdan while at breakfast. He remained all day to copy my brief. Visited in the evening 
by Dav. and Robert Wallace, with P. Howe. Had a 
friendly, sympathizing letter from Mr. Wm. Thompson, a 
lawyer of handsome talents, though a violent Democrat, 
the brother of the author of the Letters of Curtius. 1 
got acquainted with him at Abington, on the road hither. 
I do not hear any more of Mrs. Alston's intention to 
attend the trial of her father. I hope neither will add 
this to the many indiscretions already committed by him. 
Jupiter might invisibly elude the guards of Danae, but 
the bonne amie of the Col. does not I suppose occasionally 
pass his keepers with the same address. Proh pudor! 
Worked to-day chiefly on my brief, of which I have to 
night, past 12, entered on the eleventh folio. 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose at 7, A. M. Was visited by Dav. Meade, who 
tells me himself and the guard that escorted me hither 
from Kentucky will be allowed only one-half of what 
they expected, namely, instead of 10, only 5 cents per 
mile for coming and returning ; and he expects his bill 
against the United States will not be paid under two 
years after his having advanced his money for them : also, 
he understands the Marshal, Major Scott, will not pay 
Burr's witnesses, while he answers all the calls of those 
on the part of the prosecution. Does a culprit, then, 
. with an empty purse, look in vain to the provisions of the 
Constitution, which declare " that the accused shall have 
compulsory process to enable him to enforce the attendance of his witnesses ;" and may he be hanged for want 
of money, as well as of innocence? I fear the murmurs 
of agents and returning officers will be so widely diffused, 
that no one will undertake to serve subpoenas for me on 
witnesses, however material to my defense, while I will 
not lay out a dollar for promoting its success. A consid 
erable fall of rain last night and this morning has very 
agreeably lowered the temperature of the air, the high 
degree of which has, for a week past, been so very op 
pressive. I have had, by Mr. Meade, another advance 
from female humanity. Mrs. Chevalier, wife of the 
French Consul, has solicited by him my acceptance of 
any refreshments or delicacies she could send me. Read 
the three papers published here, of which the " Inquirer," 
incorrectly, and rather impertinently, notices the occasion 
of my counsel's declining to permit me to be arraigned 
last Monday. Was interrupted by idle visitors, desirous 
of gratifying their curiosity to survey my countenance 
and quarters. One of them, a rejected juryman from 
Wood county, of the name of Morrison, with whom I 
am not acquainted ; the others, strangers to me, and came, 
like many others before them, without recommendation, 
to solicit employment of serving subpoenas on witnesses. 
Had a friendly visit in the evening from Mr. Fowler, in 
company with Jourdan, and procured, through a friend, 
copies of the depositions, before the grand jury, of Peter 
Taylor, Jacob Albright, and David Wallace. The first 
having sworn that I told him we would stab all those that 
went with us to get land, and would not go on our expedition ; the second, that General Tupper arrested me on 
the " Island " the night I left it, from which I effected 
my escape by my friends directly presenting six guns at 
the General ; and the third, that I offered him the post 
of Surgeon General, if he would embark in the expedition. " God of Truth and Justice !" avenge such mur 
derous villainies in mercy ; and then, my beloved wife, 
behold and adore a guardian Providence, that ordains the 

conviction of perjury to issue in the same breath from 
21 
the lips of falsehood accusing the innocent. Mr. Fowler 
assures me Mr. Hay begins to feel sick of the business, 
and doubts not a nolle prosequi will be entered on the rec 
ords, on Burr's acquittal of the treason. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose at half-past 6 ; walked, dressed and breakfasted. 
Had a friendly letter from Prichard, requesting me to 
command his heart and hand ; also a long letter, sent by 
Phelps, but lastly from Col. Burr, from Tom Neale, con 
fessing, at last, that 'twas he bought Eansom, whom he 
will return to my wife or to myself at the same price he 
gave for him. Heard by letter from Col. Burr, in answer 
to one I wrote to him, covering another for him to for 
ward, if he wished it, to Mr. Hendren, requesting him to 
come to town, to assist Burr with his knowledge of the 
jurymen. Heard that Alston is to-day confined to his 
bed. Visited by David Meade, with two gentlemen of 
his acquaintance, summoned as talesmen, or on another 
venire pro defectum juratorum, on the last. To one of 
these, finding he was acquainted with Will. Thompson, I 
was fortunate, in procuring an opportunity, connected 
with the subject of conversation, to show Mr. T.'s hand 
some letter to me. As this party were taking leave, 
Messrs. Wickham and Botts appeared at the door ; they 
seemed pleased to find the ennui of my confinement 
relieved by company ; sat half an hour, during which 
they told me, they understood the Hendersons would 
swear much against me, but seemed to think with me, 
their story could bear but little on either count of the 
indictment. They concurred in opinion, that I should 
not hurry my trial, but should rather wait until party 
prejudice was more allayed, and the great crowd of witnesses now in town somewhat dispersed. They confirmed 
to me the fact of a subpoena having been actually issued 
for my wife, her name being one on the list of witnesses 
furnished to A. Burr. My complaints on this head they 
seemed to regard as irremediable, because A. Burr is not 
her husband. In how many instances is the letter of the 
law at war with common sense, and its own principles ? 
Are not all accomplices principals in treason? are not 
Burr and myself charged by exactly similar indictments 
with the same overt acts, at the same place ; and, conse 
quently, can the same jury, if I should choose it, or any 
other in my case, shut their eyes to testimony upon which 
Burr may be by possibility convicted? I hinted these 
ideas to these generous and accomplished advocates ; 
their silence seemed only to reply, sed ita lex scripta est. 
They, however, were of opinion that the helpless state 
of the children would justify her non-compliance with 
the summons. The moment they left me, therefore, I 
dispatched a few lines to her to that effect, which I hope 
were time enough at the office to go by this evening's 
mail. The slow march of the trial, I am told, has put 
Wilkinson out of all patience. He has been heard to 
swear in his wrath, that if Burr is not h anged, he cares 
not how soon himself were stretched on the same gal 
lows. Mr. Botts said he saw the " Querist" at old Hen 
derson's, and will advise my presence in court when the 
sons are produced to give their testimony. Progressed 
with my brief, of which I entered on the thirteenth folio, 
bringing the narrative of the case, so far as I hope I can 
prove it, down to the period of my first interview with 
Graham, on Burr's affairs at Marietta, in last November. 
I learn or conclude by letters I have received, that old 
Richard Neale and James Wilson must be in town ; I 
have as yet seen neither. Jourdan tells me, Burr lives in 
great style, and sees much company within his gratings, 
where it is as difficult to get an audience as if he really 
were an Emperor. If these things be so well founded, as 
is the hint in last Tuesday's notes, I fear Wm. Thompson 
is sketching his portraits of the characters connected 
with the trial too far West, not to lose some lines of certain features that would not escape his pencil if he 
were here. 

FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

"Went down to the kitchen after breakfast, in this wing 
of the building, my servant having gone to town to beg 
of one of the cooks there to request a keeper to bring 
the barber to shave me. Cooks were preparing the dinner for the convicts now confined here, to the number of 
about 130. This meal, I learned, generally consisted of 
three-quarters of a pound of meat, one and a half pints of 
soup, and one pint of corn-meal dough, which suffers by 
baking a diminution of one quarter of the weight. The 
breakfast, the only other meal allowed in the twenty-four 
hours, consists of the like quantity of the same sort of 
bread, and half a gill of molasses, diluted with a pint of 
water. "Not having before spoken of the police of this 
establishment, I will now mention what has fallen under 
my own observation regarding it. The convicts are con 
fined, for various terms of years, according to their several 
offenses, for which the heaviest sentence is, I believe, for 
the space of eighteen years. They are kept to labor in 
the respective trades or occupations they had been bred 
to, with no allowance of rest on any day, but Sunday, 
except during meals, being set to work at daylight, and 
leaving off at sunset. The present keeper is a smart, in 
telligent man, who tells me, before he came here, the 
value of the annual labor of the prisoners did not exceed 
$5,000 ; the expenses being nearly, as at present, $11,500. 
But he speaks confidently of raising the former, in his first 
year, to $14,500. I believe great diligence will be necessary in him to effect it. The men have not now, as under 
his predecessor, the benefit of any work they might try to 
do, over and above the limits of their task. Mr. Douglas 
assigns two curious reasons for discontinuing that little 
indulgence to these wretches ; 1st, that it was found to 
occasion expense to the State, by encouraging some folks 
to commit and confess small offenses, in order to get 
boarded here gratis for six or twelve months, when they 
would be turned out, with a sum of money in their 
pockets, for their extra labor during their confinement, 
which they would soon renew in v the same way; 2d, 
that those confined for a long term of years would prob 
ably soon debilitate themselves through this stimulus, to 
an increase of industry, by which their maintenance 
would become a dead charge, without any return to the 
State. The stimuli of Mr. D., therefore, or his superiors 
through him, are dark confinement in the cells, and the 
cow-skin, with short allowance of bread and water, which 
is not very well calculated, to prevent the last evil the 
debility now sought to be avoided. My unfortunate 
barber, I hope, fell on a lucky day for his punishment, 
well or ill deserved, for I was soon told in the kitchen 
that he was in the cells ; but expressing my concern for 
the poor fellow's misfortune, one of the cooks stepped 
out, I suppose, to signify to the proper authority the ma 
turity of my beard, no doubt, rather than the expression 
of my sorrow; and, in ten minutes, Yaun was in my 
room with his whole apparatus. This Yaun, my friends, 
is only here for eighteen years, merely for cutting his 
wife's throat, with precisely the same sort of instrument 
with which he operates most delicately on mine, every 
other day. Nor do the largest cities I have ever lived in 
boast an artist, in his line, that should supplant him in 
my favor. The physiognomy of his countenance, and the 
steadiness of his hand, with the keenness of his instrument, admirably correspond with the firmness and sensibility of his heart would to Heaven I could add, its 
purity. But hideous jealousy entered there, and goaded 
this wretch to murder and madness. A gentleman of 
Petersburg, who called in last evening with David Meade, 
assured me that Yaun, on the day he killed his wife, sat 
at his door for an hour or two, showing the bloody razor 
to the passengers in the street, and telling them how he 
had used it. The gentleman declared, had he been of 
the jury, he should not have concurred in the conviction. 
This convict is black, was born free, lived in good circum 
stances, has been to Europe, and always supported an 
excellent character. Poor Yaun ! the gloom of thy soul 
is now as dark as thy countenance ; but yet may one ray 
of Divine mercy enlighten it ! Thou shalt still shave me. 
Col. Burr wrote me to-day, that he was so surrounded 
by company he could not make up his mind upon a com 
munication I made him by letter, of which he said he 
perceived all the importance and advantages. I wrote to 
him to summon Henderson, the father, for reasons that 
will appear by my brief, urged the advantage that would 
result from my cross-examining all the witnesses (that I 
knew, particularly the Hendersons, which may be produced against him, if in my present character I could be 
allowed to act, during his trial, as an agent or advocate 
for him ; or if that should not be permitted, that I should 
at least be in court when such witnesses appear. I also 
submitted to him the expediency of one of our counsel 
seeing my brief, so far as I had written it. He added in 
his letter that one of them should call upon me for that 
purpose, and to confer on other matters this evening. 
But I have received no such visit, and must confess I am 
rather led to ascribe my disappointment less to the negligence of the advocate than to that of the client. The 
vivacity of his wit, and the exercise of his proper talents, 
now constantly solicited here in private and public exhi 
bition, while they display his powers and address at the 
levee and the bar, must engross more of his time than he 
can spare for the demands of other gratifications. Man 
is prone to what St. Pierre aptly names the harmony of 
contrast, in which the mind and the eye are as much de 
lighted in physics and in ethics as the ear is in music. 
My reflections will perhaps borrow from this principle 
hereafter, in attempting to do more justice, in expression 
of character, to a third portrait of an original, so differ 
ently appearing to my regards at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> and on the 
Mississippi. Was visited this morning by Belknap and 
P 1; the latter, one of the most active in seizing the 

boats and provisions at Marietta, last December ; also by 
D. Woodbridge, who read my brief, but to whom, as well 
as to every one else that calls upon me, I never speak on 
the subject of evidence yet, or hereafter to be, given by 
them on these trials. Had a very friendly letter from 
Col. Gushing, lamenting my situation, and assuring me 
of every exertion of his friendship to serve me; another, 
from Thos. JSTeale, exactly to the same effect as his last ; 
also a very friendly one from Mr. John Banks, accompa 
nying a present from Mrs. Banks, of two bottles of cor 
dials, and a large cake. Visited by Alston, this being 
the first day he could venture out in a carriage. He says 
appearances every day strengthen the expectation of 
Burr's acquittal on both bills, Hay having been heard 
to say, out of court, he does not think he will be able to 
substantiate the charges. It is believed, however, a motion will be made to the Court, on the acquittals, but be 
rejected, to transmit us to other districts for trial, according as evidence may appear or be procured, as may be 
contended to implicate our conduct as treasonable else 
where out of this district. Douglas has also heard Duane 
confess, that he, too, is fearful Burr must be acquitted. 
Had this evening an obliging visit, and one hour's inter 
esting French conversation with Col. de Pestre, who in 
formed me his brother-in-law, a promising young ma.n 
of various merit, had been turned out of his place as 
Clerk in the "War Office, because he could not accuse the 
Col. of Burr-ism ; and afterward, some honorable friends 
of the Government had the delicacy to insinuate how 
handsomely the Col. might be provided for in the army, 
if his principles or engagements were not adverse to the 
administration. The Col. replied, that he understood the 
hint, hut it neither suited his honor nor character to serve 
in such employment. Wrote to Col. Gushing, requesting 
him to forward to me an inventory of all my effects that 
have heen sold under attachments, and all my negroes, 
to my wife, or Col. Scott, or Mr. Harding, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, 
for her. Have not worked to-day on my "brief, from a 
prospect held out by many of my discharge on Burr's 
acquittal. Chatted as usual in the evening with Douglas, 
and having left a letter I began to Miller, for to-morrow, 
continued this diary until midnight. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Half-past 8, P. M. Have not, during the forenoon, seen 
a face, but that of my servant Billy, who, by the comfort 
I derive from his remarkable neatness and assiduity, my 
wife will not think undeserving of mention in this diary, 
which I have resolved to keep only for her gratification. 
Every one is probably at court, where this is a day of 
some interest, as the jury will probably be impanneled. 
Have done nothing but walk, and read the papers, my 
face continuing very sore with a disagreeable eruption. 
"Will now finish my letter, begun yesterday, to Miller, and 
conclude the notes of to-day after tea, by which time I 
may probably collect something worthy of notice from 
Jourdan, whom I hourly expect. While at dinner, Mr. 
Ellis called in to know if I could yet inform him when I 
might want him to serve subpoenas for me, otherwise he 
should soon leave town, seeing no prospects of getting 
any money from Col. Burr, against whom he has a de 
mand of about eleven dollars, for a boat and cargo sold 
him in October last on tbe Ohio. B., it seems, has dis 
posed of all such claims, by a declaration, it is said, he 
made in court, before my arrival, of his being a bankrupt. 
But in emptying his strong-box, which seems to have 
lost all his treasures as quickly as those that took wing 
from Pandora's, he has, I am told, like that goddess, 
closed the lid time enough to prevent the escape of that 
hope on which some favored dependents may yet mort 
gage to him their future services and the property of 
their children. It would even baffle the acuteness, and 
exhaust the deliberation, of our worthy Harding, to 
estimate the amount of this treasure, or conceive the 
structure of the debenture by which it is secured; I must 
therefore explain both. Know, then, that it has been 
whispered to me, with the important gravity so confidential a communication required, that the sum is $50,000 ; 
the security, a claim upon Government for the damages 
sustained by the culprit now trying for his life, but who 
will probably obtain his acquittal of the treason with 
more ease than he can procure one on another charge 
recorded against him in Kentucky, of having robbed the 
Western country of $1 00,000, to say nothing of the ab 
surdity of suing the United States in the face of a 
positive statute. As I was closing my letter to Miller, 
Jourdan stepped in with Rob. Nicholas, a Democrat, 
furious, keen and selfish, in chase of Alston, to secure and 
hasten the payment of bills, protested and indorsed by 
me to Sanders, to amount, with charges, etc., of fl 0,000, 
for which I will never give more than my bones, and the 
holder believing me determined, now depends on Alston's 
responsibility to me, which I have transferred to him. 
To-morrow, I shall be visited by Mr. Edmond Randolph, 
on the part of Sanders, and on my own business ; I an 
ticipate the conference with much interest. Jourdan is 
quite desolate and dispirited by the treatment of B., of 
which he will give me particulars to-morrow. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose late this morning, very ill, but satisfied I was 
affected by no influence of confinement, or the place; a 
severe headache, under which I 've all day labored, pro 
ceeding only from a derangement of the stomach, to 
which I am frequently subject. While at breakfast, I 
was visited by Mr. P., a merchant of consideration here, 
who had not before called upon me, for which he apolo 
gized, and in whom I admired here, in the spring of 
1 800, the most amiable manners, with a fine musical taste, 
and handsome execution on the violin, he and myself, 
during my stay, being the principal performers in the 
Harmonic Society. My worthy friend Prichard led the 
way, as much heated by the warmth of his friendship as 
of his two miles' walk, bringing with him also Wood, the 
late editor of the Atlantic World, a paper, which is now 
extinct, and may be truly said to have been the last faint 
effort, save these trials, of expiring Burr-ism under the 
relentless fury of Democracy. Wood is a singular looking man, with a countenance expressive of great oddity, 
if not of genius ; of few words, with embarrassed man 
ner, but said to be skilled in mathematics. His appearance altogether inspired some interest to know him 
better, and he will, by my desire, enable me to improve 
our acquaintance. I was agreeably occupied with this 
party until General Tupper appeared ; the news of his 
arrival in town, "brought me yesterday evening by Jourdan, must have caused some little mental uneasiness last 
night and this morning, of which I was unable to render 
an account to myself. This intelligence could not reach 
my ears without arriving in the same instant at my heart, 
where it was at once amalgamated with all my hopes and 
anxiety for my family. With what rapidity did I calcu 
late, over and over, and conclude that I must hear from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> by the General. I had written to my wife from 
the Chickasaw Nation, to direct to me under cover to the 
General. I hardly permitted myself to conclude an inter 
change of salutations with him when I eagerly inquired 
for a letter; he had none, and he left home^as late as the 
5th instant. But a few more mails from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> and 
Marietta, without the blessing of a letter, and I shall endeavor to prepare myself for more awful trials than the 
death-warrant of a wicked or a jealous Government. 
General Tupper's conversation, which lasted about one 
hour with me, was very interesting, both to my curiosity 
regarding the intelligence I could derive from him on my 
own account, and my admiration of that honorable inde 
pendence he will yet make the Government feel more of, 
on his part, when they wish or desire, from the experience 
they have already had of his temper. It seems much of 
the artifice of intrigue, on the part of Government or 
their runners, has been put in requisition to endeavor 
to mold the General's disposition in the temper of the 
present prosecutions. He has next encountered attempts 
upon his honor indirectly, to induce him in some degree 
to countenance the testimonies of Taylor and Albright to 
the facts of his having arrested me, with my rescue and 
escape from him, mentioned 12th instant ; outrages upon 
his character and feelings, which he has repelled with 
that disgust and contempt suggested by his honor, but 
not without thereby incurring, what, until then, the con 
servators of Jeffersonian fame never thought of, insinuations of his concern, and threats to involve him in the 
pains and penalties of the conspiracy. Either before or 
after this analysis of the stuff, which would not take the 
dye, proposed, it was politely signified to him, that al 
though he had been recognized as a witness, on the part 
of the United States, the prosecutors, in kind consideration of the inconvenience another journey might put him 
to, would dispense with his further attendance. He said, 
however, he would return were he obliged to travel on 

his hands and knees. He also tells me, Doctor "W is 

alarmed at my presence here to confront him, when he 
shall dare to offer such testimony again as he has ven 
tured before the grand jury, and is terrified, for he is no 
doctor, at the thoughts of being examined publicly by 
those who are of that profession, to prove he is not one. 
See my notes of 12th instant, and it will appear how 
properly I wanted to fill the place of Surgeon-General in 
the expedition ; but General Tupper says, he knows a 
person to whom W. said I was jesting with him when I 
spoke of his going with me as Surgeon-General. I have 
not been gratified with the visit I expected to-day with 
so much interest from Mr. Randolph, but have had a 
long one from Alston, which was taken up chiefly with 
the subject of an arrangement of the demands of Sanders 
and Miller; the agency of Nicholas has been so tar 
effective as to induce Alston to offer to take a journey 
forthwith to South Carolina to try to raise the money, 
leaving Mrs. A. here until his return. He can not offei 1 
hopes of the success of this attempt, and no final adjustment, I believe, will be effected, but by the opinion and 
advice of Mr. Randolph. Mr. Craughton called this 
evening, after a severe walk of three miles, and remained 
about two hours. 

MONDAY, AUGUST 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This is a black Monday indeed with me, whether the 
"cloudiness of my mind or of the sky makes it appear 
such. I feel well to-day, and took breakfast with some 
appetite, during which Col. de Pestre entered, and kept 
up an interesting conversation with me until noon, which, 
from the complete coincidence of our opinions on certain 
characters, and the reflections arising from the notes we 
had to compare on our past interest, and connection with 
them, could not much tend to fortify me for encountering 
the new mortifications occasioned me by a letter I have 
just received from my estimable friend, Jos. S. Lewis, in 
his private capacity, informing me that the house of 
which he is the head, had, in consequence of attachments 
served on my funds, my last pecuniary resource of my 
poor family in their hands, been obliged to dishonor all 
the bills I had drawn, that were presented for acceptance 
since the 20th of last January, the day such , attachments 
were served, at suit of the Kentucky Insurance Company 
and Lewis Sanders, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. What discredits and 
embarrassments the return of bills I have drawn at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, to amount of 700 or 800, will occasion my 
afflicted wife, I fear to estimate. Every day's trial seems 
to inflict a new wound upon my heart, or some part of it 
that has not bled for my wife and children ; my own suf 
ferings have long since destroyed the tone, and established 
the apathy, of every nerve that vibrated to the first im 
pulses of the perfidy and injustice that, by their continued 
action, since the beginning of last October to the present 
hour, have relieved my mind from all care for the duration or issue of my confinement. I have just dispatched 
a letter to Alston, requesting to see him, and another to 
Pri chard, desiring him to retain, or, if disposed of, to try 
and take up a small bill I drew on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> a few 
days since for $100. Joe Lewis tells me he will honor 
Harding's bills, drawn on himself for $500, in consideration of my wife's situation. ! my wife, we thought we 
were serving a P . . . . , and have been the dupes of an 
advocate. De Pestre has justly taken up the ideas sug 
gested in my notes of last Friday. This generous foreigner 
has narrowed his means of maintaining a large family, 
besides some orphans, to the amount of $5,000, for which 
he has not been even thanked. I hear Alston's carriage, 
and must now close, but for what purpose ? to hear a re 
petition of the same professions of concern already made 
me, to which is added, however, an offer to go to Caro 
lina, in two or three days, to try to raise some money, the 
success of which, however, I must understand, is very 
problematical. What could I reply to the professions of one 
of the richest men in the Union, offering to assume these 
demands, ready to sell or mortgage, but yet unable to get 
the money I never used a cent of, but for which the cries 
of rapacious creditors rend the walls of my prison ah ! 
that would be indifferent to me, did I not fear they are 
loud enough to reach and swell that heart that will echo 
them back to mine. For what purpose could I desire to 
see him again on this business, but to make the last sacri 
fice I had to offer ; alas ! I once thought it impossible ; I 
blush to name it, to humble the pride of integrity before 
that of wealth to solicit his charity. I have thus sought 
relief through the storm by every effort of skill or diligence I could make, until, wearied and exhausted, I have 
set down in the humility of my heart, to drift perhaps to 
that shore where the mercy of Heaven will recompense 
me, in the participation of the rewards prepared for the 
fortitude and virtues of a wife I have been so long 
blessed with. It is a relief to my heart to fill a whole 
page with a single sentence. The flood of my sorrows is 
too copious to suffer the artificial breaks and pauses of 
critical rules. My wife will feel this, if no one else can. 
I wrote a very long letter to Joe Lewis, which I immediately began when Alston left me, to acquaint him that 
bills with my indorsements, on account of which one of 
the attachments had been served on his house, as my 
garnishee had long since been paid by Alston's agent, 
Mr. Sam. Allen, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> ; that I had, in addition 
to the arrangement I made with Sanders at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, 
Kentucky, a prospect of making further arrangements 
here, through Alston, with Rob. Nicholas, the agent, and 
Mr. Edmond Randolph, the lawyer of Mr. Sanders, by 
which I should, I expected in a few days, have the attachment at suit of Sanders taken off, and in the mean time, 
until I could see Mr. Randolph, which I could not do 
to-day before the mail closed, I hoped Mr. L. would believe his house would not be proceeded against as my 
garnishee, and whatever obstruction to their currency 
the little resources I yet possessed through his house in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> were incumbered with, would be removed. 
I have, to-night, also written to Mr. Randolph, to request 
him to call upon me to-morrow, before court opens. 
Speaking to-day, while Alston was here, before Col. 
McKee, of what was doing in court, whither I wrote to 
Alston to come to me, A. said, they left Hay stating 
the case, on the part of the prosecution, damned the 
speaker, and declared he would whip a son of his, were 
he only twelve years old, that could not make a better. 
This led me to praise a pamphlet, entitled "Agrestis," 
which Alston yesterday brought me, being two letters on 
Wilkinson's proceedings at Tew Orleans, which for its 
arrangement and strength, as well as for some imagery 
of the language, I observed, would not be unworthy of a 
Curran, at the same time inquiring who was the author. 
A. said that was not known. I then repeated the question to Col. McKee, who said it was a friend of ours ; at 
least Mr. A. was suspected. I mention this trifling occur 
rence for the sake of observing that Alston was now 
silent, thereby appropriating to himself the merit of the 
book, which his wife, I have no doubt, might produce ; 
for by the title-page of the second edition printed here, it 
appears the former, or first edition, was published in 
South Carolina, or else it has proceeded from some other 
genius of much mind and erudition; but to suppose 
Alston the author would be preposterous ; obscurity may 

consistently veil the parentage of Hercules, but it would 
be ridiculous to suppose him the offspring of a dwarf. 
Take this trait and test it by the fact. There is a pro 
vincial phrase or two in the pamphlet which I will keep, 
that proves it first saw the light at New Orleans. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

It may easily be conceived how difficult it must be for 
one in the state of mind in which I closed my notes of 
the heavy hours of yesterday, to fall into that oblivious 
repose, through sleep, which easily ensues upon the ces 
sation of ordinary labor of body or mind, and enables us, 
by recreation, to perform the task of misfortune allotted 
for the morrow. Accordingly, I did not find my bed 
what it always proves to the peasant or the mariner, the 
grave of care. The tumult of my mind had so inflamed 
my body, that irritation on the surface could not be 
allayed, while trouble reveled within. I was restless, for 
I was sick at heart, and slept not soundly until toward 
morning. Yet I rose betimes, and had an early visit 
from Mr. Randolph, who called upon me, in pursuance 
of my request to him by letter of last night. I stated to 
him my embarrassment, by Mr. Sanders attaching the 
only remaining funds that were tangible, and insufficient 
for the support of my family ; observing, that if Mr. S. 
did not withdraw the attachment, which I hoped Mr. 
Randolph would forthwith, as S.'s lawyer, persuade his 
agent, Mr. Nicholas, to do, I should consider my arrangements at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a> with Mr. S., to secure and settle his 
demands through Mr. Alston, as abrogated. This seemed 
to engage his reflections ; but I was sorry soon to find he 
had the indelicacy, not only to inquire what was the 
amount of my funds in the hands of Messrs. Jos. S. Lewis 
and Co., but even to tell me that if a sum of $1,000, or 
even $500, could be got immediately for Nicholas and 
Sanders, who, he knew, wanted money, such an expe 
dient, he rather believed, would tend to give effect to 
some arrangement into which Mr. Alston might be induced to enter ; adding, as he was taking leave, " that I 
knew how much a little ready cash helped these sort of 
things forward." I had before observed to Mr. R. that 
he must know now, from the nature of my financial em 
barrassments, detailed to him in these transactions, how 
little I could presume on counsel I could not remunerate, 
Before he left me, he said, Burr has an excellent jury, on 
the whole, with the exception of Parker alone, who, he 
acknowledged, is a worthy, honorable man, but a violent 
Jeffersonian partisan. I expressed my surprise at Burr's 
accepting him, after he had avowed in court as strong 
prejudices as some who had been rejected. This indis 
cretion on Burr's part he censured. He then told me 
Hay was very weak yesterday in stating the case, and he 
had no doubt of an acquittal ; but to save time and labor, 
he very much wished the Chief Justice should concur in 
opinion with the counsel on the defense, who yesterday 
contended, in a lengthy argument with their opponents, 
that no evidence of intentions should be gone into until 
overt acts had been first proven. How the court have 
decided I shall know in the morning. I now soon dis 
patched a note to Alston, and fortunately continued 
reading Agrestis until I heard his carriage-wheels, which 
seemed to rattle in my ears ; " read on " until after he had 
entered the room ; i. e., a thought struck me that possibly he might have had something to do in the compo 
sition, and I might do more with him, through his vanity of authorship, than I had yet been able to effect 
through any other channel. Admirable ! cried I, before 
I answered his salute ; he smiled " what ! " said he, 
" Agrestis, are you pleased with that little thing? "Well, 
I did not care to notice it yesterday ; but I will now tell 
you in confidence, 't was I wrote it." I then pointed out 
to him an image or two, particularly one in the first let 
ter, of Justice, surrounded by the laws, in the sanctuary 
of her temple, poising in their presence tlie balance with 
her own hand, which, I said, would be a fine subject for 
the relief, alto relievo ; while the stations of her executive 
officers, assigned them without the sanctuary, might beau 
tifully form the intaglio, or back-ground, of a good piece 
of sculpture. Here I threw down the book, which he as 
readily took up, to descant on other merits it possessed, 
or point out errors of the press; all of which engaged 
my most profound attention. The organ now wound 
up ; I lost no time to try upon it the tune my heart first 
called for ; how do you think it went ? To admiration ! 
the instrument was now so much improved ; the piece, so 
often tried on it before, was now not only performed in 
half the time it used to be, but was worth double the 
money it would bring yesterday. In plain English, in 
stead of paying one-half the money next January twelve 
months, and the other half the January following, ac 
cording to his utmost powers, to-day he was tuned up to 
the incredible power of paying the whole, not indeed to 
day, but next April twelve months. Who knows yet but 
a judicious combination of discords to be selected from 
the letter to Pinkne}^ with some more of the melody of 
Agrestis, might produce a harmony which, if it can not 
move the oaks, may still solicit the responsive cadence of 
the dollars? He left me with animated assurances of 
seeing Nicholas to-day, and myself again upon the "business, not, however, without some pretty simpers about 
Mr. Randolph's hint of the $500, which he regarded as 
soliciting a douceur for Nicholas; but even that, he 
hinted, in the suavity of his self-complacency, would not 
be impossible, when I assured him it should go in part 
of the demand. I have had two or three reasons to-day 
of lightening my heart of the load that oppressed it yes 
terday. After Mr. Randolph left me, I walked about, 
invoking the saving providence of Heaven over my wife 
and children ; secondly, better prospects opened to me, 
from my interview with Alston ; and, thirdly, the sincere 
pleasure I felt in writing to another Eugenius, as dear to 
me as the first was to Yorick, to communicate to Harding a transcript of my notes of yesterday, and a short 
letter of to-day, to enable him to observe the better under 
what part of the tottering fabric of my affairs he may set 
the firm prop of his care and friendship for my family 
a service in which, I feel, he will not dally. The regards 
of my wife may one day give him a perusal of these 
notes, as a supplement to his comments on "Agrestis," 
which I have also sent him. I feel no tedium loci, and 
have no want but that of letters. Cock-crow announces 
the morn. Grant, God ! it brings health to my family ! 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
Saw Dud. Woodbridge, before breakfast, who told me 
Eaton, Truxton, Taylor, and Albright were yesterday 
examined on the trial. This intelligence has fretted me, 
because I find Burr disregards the caution I gave him, to 
have me present during the examination of the witnesses 
I knew, as they should be produced against him. I have 
heard he alters the notes of his counsel, increased yester 
day by the addition of Mr. Lee, and for the most part 
marks out the course they pursue on his defense. I hope 
his negligence of the suggestions I have made to him 
will not furnish more cause of repentance than he is 
already burdened with. Hay, having again called for my 
arraignment, and Mr. Botts having, I am told, said he 
would try to be ready by Saturday, I must again revert 
to my labors on my brief, which I shall resume this even 
ing. The Chief Justice has, I think properly, allowed 
the prosecutors to follow their own course in adducing 
their evidence, provided they ofFer none of any -other 
treason than what is laid in the indict. It will appear, 
from a correct report of the trial, how far Hay contends 
that the doctrine of constructive treason is law in this 
country. How candid he is ; and what a virulent dispos 
ition McRae manifests to insinuate bias in the court to 
ward the accused. Mr. John Banks brought me, this 
morning, a paper containing Bollman's long letter to 
Duane, respecting B.'s communication to the President, 
which, if not quite a justification of the writer, settles 
however, forever, the honor and good faith of Jefferson. 
I have not seen Alston, according to my expectation and 
his promise ; the general interest and curiosity engaged 
at the capitol must suspend all other concerns. This 
evening General Tupper tells me that Hay boasts of having a number of witnesses to establish the credit of Al 
bright. Eternal Justice, then, support my innocence of 
the facts he has ventured to swear against me, until I shall 
appear before thy tribunal, where the vicious shall only 
testify to their own crimes. General Tupper has also a 
suspicion that Meiggs may venture to injure his credit as 
a witness ; but the slightest attempt of that sort shall ex 
hibit Meiggs branded in the next papers as a liar and a 
coward. Eaton's manner and delivery in giving his evidence is highly extolled in the two Democratic papers, 
the Argus and Inquirer; but I am better informed he 
strutted more in buskin than usual on that occasion, and 
the effect was as diverting to the whole court as it prob 
ably was beneficial to the defense. Still, Douglas, who is 
pretty regular in his evening visits to me, or to my grog 
and cigars, tells me Burr is as cheerful as ever, though he 
can not feel insensible to the advantage the prosecutors 
have taken, in framing the indictment in a manner to 
correspond in its form with the substance of the opinion 
given by Chief Justice Marshall, in the cases of Bollman 
and Swartwout, and the industry they practice to train 
and back their witnesses to support it. But as a jockey 
might restore his fame in the course, after he had injured 
it on the tight-rope, so perhaps the little " Emperor,"' at 
Cole's Creek, may be forgotten in the Attorney at Rich 
mond. I have been weak all day, and again put off briefing until to-morrow. 11 P. M. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I had Mr. Douglas called to me, to request him to treat 
me to a walk in the yard this morning before breakfast. 
My visitors, in the course of the day, generally complain 
of the closeness of my apartment, and some tell n.e they 
choose to reside in certain quarters of the town for the 
sake of high elevation and more air; others, that they 
prefer country quarters near town, for similar reasons, and 
wishing me soon to partake of like advantages. My 
walk for half an hour in the yard this morning, heing the 
second time I have been from under the roof of this 
building, save the day I was taken to court, 10th instant, 
was very agreeable, notwithstanding its narrow limits, 
both of time and space, and the high walls and buildings, 
in defiance of all which my lungs seemed to me to quaff 
their aerial draughts with a spring and vigor I have seldom felt before. I have procured materials from the 
druggist for making some oxygenized muriatic acid gas, 
with which I will, perhaps to-morrow, destroy the noisome 
miasma that infests the air of these rooms. Continued 
my labors on my brief, of which I completed the seven 
teenth folio by dinner time, when, who will believe it ! I 

was visited in the most friendly manner by David "W e. 

It is inconceivable how he will profit by the hints he has 
had from General Tupper, or if called upon again, which 
he seems to dread, how he will travel out of his deposition before the grand jury. I received him with the 
courtesy of a prisoner, now in his own quarters. He sat 
a little, and then took leave, confused. I was not after 
ward left fifteen minutes alone, before every muscle of 
my face was relaxed from the rigor in which W. had 
bound them, to wanton in the liveliest welcome of Little 
Gates, who hurried to take my hand with an ardor and 
frankness that testified the sincere interest he felt in seeing me well. He had been in town since Sunday, but his 
duties of attending to the chance of his being called as a 
witness in court, and the irresistible interest excited there 
since his arrival, prevented his calling on me sooner. He 
staid better than an hour, during which his conversation 
was full of interest and entertainment, from certain com 
munications he made me, of men and things, of which 
I shall make use in my brief, as well as from two or three 
anecdotes and stories he told me of some military char 
acters, and their achievements at Marietta, on the night 
the boats were seized there, of all which he acquitted 
himself with great humor and spirit. I shall expect the 
fulfillment of his promise to visit me often, with as much 
interest as I felt this evening. Visited by a sensible, gen 
teel man, with a hard Dutch name, which I forget, having lost his ticket. He reminded me of having seen me, 
seven years ago, in this town, and invited me to his house, 
when I recover my liberty. My last visitor was Stokely, 
who declared, had he been in Wood county at the time 
of the troubles, by which my family and property so 
much suffered, he would have exerted whatever influence 
he had to prevent them. He said he was very sorry to 
observe the counsel on both sides agreeing in one thing 
at least, that is, to keep me so constantly as they do in 
the front of the fight. He could not understand the 
policy of A. Burr's counsel, contending that their client 
is not answerable for any acts of mine, and affected to 
lament deeply his fears, that, in addition to all I had al 
ready suffered, I should end at last by falling a victim between the cunning of Burr, on the one side, and the fury 
and prejudice of the prosecutors on the other. I thanked 
him, and said, I had thoughts of summoning him as a 
witness for certain purposes that might be connected with 
my defense, hoping, if I should do so, he would excuse 
the trouble of the journey ; to which he assented, with 
expressing great desire to see me again settled in the 
" White House on the Island." But how much sooner 
should I suspect treachery in this man twelve months 
past, than in others who have since been seeking my ruin. 
Old Neale will not come to see me, partly from scruples 
as to the obligations of duty, being summoned on part of 
prosecution, and the aversion he would feel to see me in 
this place. Hay having yesterday stated he would rest 
the evidence, as to the overt acts, "Wickham has to-day 
spoken very ably for four hours, chiefly to contend, that, 
the acts not having been proved, no evidence should be 
offered of the intentions, or that if the acts have been 
proved, Burr, as an accessary at a distance from the scene 
of action, can not be proceeded against, until I, as a prin 
cipal, shall be convicted. If I have been correctly in 
formed, the ground has been judiciously taken, and will 
no doubt be ably maintained by Mr. Wickham, and the 
host that will follow him. I can not expect, at such a 
crisis, Alston will give a thought to any thing out of 
court. I should have added, w r hen speaking of Stokely, 
that I learned from him that James Wilson has lost his 
wife, and left Wood county for another residence. How 
has he left my business ? and what has he done with the 
valuable papers I intrusted to his charge ? My children, 
will your unhappy father yet have days and health sufficient to gather together the little fragments of your prop 
erty, so widely scattered over the face of the earth ? If 
he but live to finish that task, he will then be ready to 
take the last journey for his wages. My wife will, if I 
can not, seek the obligations of Dud. Woodbridge, sen., 
and others, from J. Wilson, before she spares a sigh to time. 

FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

D. Woodbridge called and sat with me this morning 
longer than he has done altogether since I have been 
here. He has got over the care of his examination, 
which worried him yesterday in court nearly two hours, 
and was, I understand, rather a disservice to the interests 
of the prosecution than otherwise. No witnesses are yet 
discharged, and all are as uncertain how long they will 
be detained as ever, unless there be grounds for an opin 
ion Mr. Botts has given to Duane, that the trial will be 
over by Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. B. must think 
Hay, who, I hear, has demanded time to examine authori 
ties cited on the other side in support of Wickham's 
motion, will not succeed in opposing it. It appears my 
name is as often made use of in court, during my absence, 
as it will be again on my own trial, when some curious, 
contrarieties of facts and testimonies may come out, if I 
ever shall be tried. D. Woodb ridge, from looking over 
that part of my brief narrating the conduct of the Hender 
sons, in betraying my confidence to Graham, etc., was led 
to acquaint me with a fact I was not a little mortified to 
learn, viz., that Botts is married to a sister of Mrs. Sandy 
Henderson. Must I, then, withhold to defend myself 
against the most serious witnesses against me, though my 
generous benefactor and enlightened patron, engaged to 
protect my life and character against the deadly assaults 
of his own relatives, with no other recompense than the 
pride of interposing the barrier of his talents between a 
distressed family and its menaced ruin, be averse to 
listen to a statement he would still less choose to advocate 
of his connections ? Had I been apprised of this difficulty 
in my first interview with Mr. B., I know not how he 
could have relieved me from it. I must see him on the 
subject before I send him a brief. Strange, that every 
embarrassment I labor under, great or small, is derived 
from the same source. Dudley tells me my wife's favorite horse, Robin, was stolen, with other things, by one 

Welch, who has not since been heard of; that J s, the 

honest, returned him the $40, and that M , the zeal 
ous, kept the other $20. Falsehood ! thy name is Man 
not Woman. Willey visited me to-day, and was truly 
glad to see me again. I made him give me a detail of all 
his adventures from leaving the boats. He had traveled, 
in his story, as far as Fort St. Stephen's, on the Tombigbee river, where he was arrested, after having lost one of 
his horses, and lived with the mulatto boy Harry for six 
days on damaged corn. Having missed his way, he had not seen Col. Burr from the time he left Judge B 's till he found him at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

While at breakfast, little Luckett stepped in. He produced to me, I hope, the last bill, with my indorsement, 
drawn by Burr ; I had no note or recollection of it. It 
was drawn on the same baseless authority as the rest, for 
$2,500, and had, of course, suffered a like fate ; yet 
Luckett had not attempted any proceedings against me, 
though he showed me an account stating a balance 
against Burr of upward of 8,000, by which, and losses 
he has sustained, he says, he has been quite ruined. He 
intreated my best interests with Alston, and never expects 
any thing from rne. I nope soon to be able to state the 
details of a final arrangement with Burr and Alston, to 
extricate me from all these embarrassments. Having 
learned from Luckett, I was to be taken to court to-day, 
at noon, to be arraigned, I was in the act of dressing 
when two Deputy Marshals called upon me, half an hour 
earlier than was necessary, excusing themselves by saying my watch was so much too slow, though it was 
exactly with the town clock. The distance from hence 
to the capitol being nearly a mile, and as I have not been 
well, I had sent my servant to town to procure me a 
horse, but as he had not yet returned, I asked these gen 
tlemen if they had brought a carriage, as had been done 
the last day I was taken to court, telling them my reasons 
for not wishing to walk. They answered, " the law did 
not make any such provisions, and the walk would serve 
me." So I soon attended them, though not in the style 
that was provided the 10th instant. My two attendants 
on foot, to-day, were unarmed, both going and returning. 
I had time enough before court opened to prepare for my 
counsel a list of thirty-nine witnesses I should have time 
allowed me to get here before I could be ready to go to 
trial. Of these, I informed Mr. Botts, twelve I deemed 
material to disprove all evidence that did, or might yet 
attempt to, prove my having committed any overt act ; 
the rest to prove I had in nothing manifested a traitorous 
design, and of the number I wanted subpcenas duces tecum, 
for five or six, to procure the production of various documents that might be necessary to my defense. My other 
witnesses are summoned on either side, in the present 
trial; so that the original list I took with me to court to 
day contains no less than fifty -five. Mr. B. then stated, 
that as a long list of witnesses I had furnished him lived 
as distant from hence as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, it seemed hest to post 
pone my arraignment until the opinion of the court 
should he known on the several points made on the part 
of A. Burr, which would equally affect my case and his, 
when, if necessary, I should he prepared to state at what 
time I could expect the forthcoming of my witnesses, so 
that I might be arraigned by Wednesday. To this, Hay 
agreed ; the court, which sat to-day only on my account, 
was adjourned, and I returned to this prison as I left it, 
that is, unarraigned. I hear Bollman is with Burr con 
stantly, and no doubt busy. If it does not appear that 
Burr can boast as Chas. Fox did, amidtice, sempiternce, yet 
may he say inimicitice placabilis. Alston's prose, and Bollman's talents for intrigue, are recommendations or ano 
dynes to a mind that finds no difficulty in obliterating the 
impressions of sensations heretofore received from either 
by the letter to Pinkney, which is before the public, or 
the process-verbal of the interview with Jefferson, which 
is not yet given to the world in detail. Enough has 
already appeared in these notes to warrant my suspicions 
as to Alston ; and, in addition to the hint given, to-day 
and 19th instant, of my opinion on Bollman's manoeuvre 
with Jefferson, I am the more confirmed in a disposition 
to mistrust both the motive and the matter of the inter 
view, as well as his letter to Duane, because, as yet, he 
has not had the curiosity to see me ; neither a community 
of interest nor suffering has affected him. He has had no 
other motive probably to suggest to him a wish for my 
acquaintance, for he has possibly never heard from 
authority that I had been offered to choose him or Shaw 
for my private secretary, when I should name a diplomatic 
appointment for myself. This would have been a useless 
and dangerous humiliation of Mr. B.'s pride, which, no 
doubt, his master has long since found more accommo 
dating to his views than mine. My visitors, this evening, 
were General Tupper, D. Woodbridge, Belknap, Wood 
and Doctor Bennett. The last, who has been brought 
here to support P. Taylor's evidence, of my having writ 
ten to him a treasonable letter, by Taylor, is friendly, and 
can swear that I wrote nothing to him of a traitorous 
nature, though Taylor told him the letter was of that 
sort when he gave it to him. The doctor says, he sup 
posed I wanted the arms I wrote to him to endeavor to 
borrow for me, ten or twenty guns, to defend my family 
and property against illegal outrage he knew I appre 
hended at that time from the Wood county volunteers, 
in the same sense in which, in my brief, I have stated this 
part of my case to counsel. General Tupper read over a 
most humorous lampoon on most of the military charac 
ters engaged in the heroic feats of arms they performed 
on the night of the 10th of December last at Marietta, 
of which, I hope, I shall obtain a copy to relieve the 
ennui of these notes. I find it very agreeable this evening to get upon a chair, by which I am enabled to raise 
my mouth to the lower tier of openings in the grating 
of the windows and breathe another air for half an hour. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

If Alston could not make the same excuse for not calling on me yesterday that he might have offered some days 
back, still less could he do so to-day, when I suspect he 
has been sent to me. Luckett, this morning, told me it 
was Col. Burr's wish that I should write to Alston, to do 
the best he could for him, about the dishonored bill L. 
holds with my indorsement. Suspecting the correctness 
of this statement, I replied, " that Col. Burr was a ready 
penman, and in the habit of writing to me on matters of 
business ; that L., therefore, must endeavor to get him to 
specify, under his hand, how it was necessary Mr. Alston 
should learn his wishes from me while they saw each 
other every day; my own wishes for the relief of L. I 
had no objection to signify to Mr. Alston in my own way." 
Luckett posted off, and has procured by his importunities, 
not a letter from Burr, who never puts pen to paper 
but under the influence of necessity, though he is, per 
haps, the most constant writer in America, but a visit 
from Alston. When he came in, I inquired, "what 
were Col. Burr's expectations of the fate of the motions 
now before the court ? " He said, " they, or some of them, 
would prevail, and the trial would be over by Wednesday 
or Thursday ; that he and Mrs. Alston would very soon 
leave town, and that Col. Burr, on his discharge, would 
immediately occupy himself with the business of forming a land company, and settling the Washita lands." 
Perceiving he had an interest in thus abruptly informing 
me of this project, I encouraged him to dwell upon it, 
when I found that, though he had been conversing with 
Burr 011 the subject, he wished me to inform him whether 
Burr had ever seen the lands. I told him I was not cer 
tain, but believed not, adding, that Tyler and Smith, 
who had once been very intent on settling there, had long 
ago abandoned the scheme, believing, from information 
they had procured, and could rely upon, Lynch's title was 
bad, and they were accordingly busily preparing to settle 
in the Attakapas .country, very distant from the Washita 
lands, which were condemned by very good judges I 
named to him, who had visited them. Alston seemed 
surprised at this intelligence, and said the commissioners 
had confirmed Lynch's title. I told him I doubted that, 
but it was immaterial, as Lynch had long ago been a 
bankrupt, so that I had not much thought of accepting 
or purchasing 10,000 acres of those lands which Col. 
Burr had offered me. I should not be surprised to learn 
very soon that Burr has been promising to replenish 
Alston's coffers, which he will empty of 50,000 at least, 
from his Eldorado on the Washita. I well know B.'s 
address, in preventing or evading the simple questions he 
does not like to answer. I have seen Alston often yield 
to it, and wonder not that he shall seek from me that in 
formation of which he found Burr so tenacious. This, 
then, may turn out another instance, in addition to many 
others I have furnished, in which B. may see cause to 
deprecate my knowledge of him, and curse that candor 
of integrity that has so often traversed his purposes. 
Bollman's cautious skill, perhaps, will never betray him 
into similar indiscretions ; but Major Smith will be here 
to-morrow, and then bursts the bubble. After I had next 
given Alston some account, by his desire, of the country 
about <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, in which I also took liberty to correct 
many errors in Col. Burr's view of that subject, I con 
trived to let him broach the business he came on. He 
asked me if I had seen Nicholas to-day. I said no ; but 
Luckett had been here with another of my indorsements, 
and an account he showed me, with a balance struck 
against Col. Burr, of something better than $8,000 ; thus, 
said I, almost every week I discover some new demand 
upon me on account of this business ; and I have now 
ascertained that, besides other losses, my name has me 
responsible for $21,000. Well ! says he, it will cost me at 
least $50,000. I mentioned the bill and balance together, 
to try if he would offer any objections to responsibilities 
I had entered into exceeding the amount of his guarantee 
to me, but finding he did not, I then told him the amount 
of the bill was only $2,500. With the account between 
Col. Burr and Luckett I had no concern, and recom 
mended the latter to such present relief as he could afford 
him. He seemed pleased ; said Nicholas would probably 
accept his terms ; should remove the incumbrances on my 
property in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and invited me to Carolina, and 
promised soon to see me again. Then, returning to the 
subject of the trial, he told me a piece of news, which 
well deserves a place here as so much secret history, 
characteristic of the feelings and energies of the Chief 
Justice. It seems, after the Judge had determined to 
give the prosecutors time, from Friday until Monday, to 
prepare to answer the arguments of the opposite counsel 
on four points, any one of which being supported by the 
court, the trial ends. A friend of General Marshall asked 
him if, in suspending a criminal prosecution by granting 
this indulgence, he had not made a rule that had no pre 
cedent. To this he answered, "he knew it;" but if he 
should decide against the prosecutors on any of these 
points, he would be reproached with not being disposed to 
give them an opportunity to answer them ; and that he 
will probably not overrule them at all is more probable 
from an expression of his, while playing at chess with 
Wickham, since the latter made the points. " Do n't you 
think," said he, "you will be able to check-mate these 
fellows, and relieve us from being kept here three weeks 
more ? " In the evening Gates called, and soon left me, 
to give way to Wickham and Botts. This visit provided 
for a wish I yesterday expressed, in court, to Mr. B., to 
see him in the course of this day, my object being to state 
to him candidly the objections I had lately discovered to 
his appearing as an advocate for me in my defense, which 
might expose the breach of honor and confidence I com 
plained of, on the part of his connections. But as he 
brought Mr. Wickham with him, and it seemed their 
joint opinion that the decision on the points now before 
the court would probably this week put an end to Burr's 
trial, and occasion the relinquishment of mine, or, if that 
did not happen, they had determined upon a plea in 
abatement, for a misnomer to the indictment in my case, 
which they thought must prevail, and then the prose 
cutors would probably despair of success in getting 
another grand jury to find another bill against me ; or, 
if they should make such an experiment, I should most 
probably, in the mean time, be admitted to bail. From 
this view of their opinions, I said I hoped it would not be 
necessary to trouble them with my brief, and I could not 
venture the appeal to Mr. Botts's feelings, which I pro 
posed to make in this interview. My accomplished 
friends now terminated their visit with their accustomed 
kindness, and left me in a sublime reverie on their virtues 
and talents, which was soon broken in upon, by the ap 
pearance of Mr. Douglas with a stranger ; I should rather 
have said, by two apparitions, for it was now near night 
fall, and Douglas no sooner appeared than he turned on 
his heel, saying, " Colonel Duane, sir," and ran down 
stairs. The surprise of this interruption the stranger, 
whom I had never before seen, did not suffer to endure 
long enough to allow me to invoke the angels and min 
isters of grace for my protection. I was already within 
the grasp of this Gabriel of the Government. He seized 
my hand, and bade me dismiss my surprise, however 
natural it might be on his appearance before me. I 
handed him a chair, and said, " I had lived long enough 
in this country to be surprised at nothing it could produce 
or exhibit, but yet desired to learn from what cause I had 
the favor of this visit." " Having heard Mr. Douglas ob 
serve," said he, " you would be pleased to see me." " Sir, 
Mr. D. has made a mistake ; he must have meant some 
body else." " No matter," continued he ; " having seen 
and known your present situation, I could not as a man, 
and an Irishman" here he digressed, to show how he 
both was, and was not, an Irishman " I would not leave 
this town without warning you of the sacrifice now pre 
paring to appease the Government by your friends, of 
which you are destined to be the victim. You can not 
desire any other key to my meaning than the course the 
defence has this week taken ; but if you think the Government will not cease to pursue that justice they possess 
the means of insuring, and suspect, as you ought, the 
designs of those you have too long thought your friends, 
it might yet appear no better, on my part, than a nominal 
service to give you these cautions. I have therefore 
sought you, not to tender you words, hut deeds ; the only 
return, on your part, will be that care of yourself which 
will find a shield in my honor " here he very awkwardly 
struck his breast, and grinned a ghastly smile " and 
that confidence I can command in the Government, whose 
good faith is not misplaced in the zeal I have testified to 
serve it." To this harangue, delivered somewhat less, 
perhaps, with the action and manner of Satan personating Duane than that of a felon, he added violent prot 
estations of his wishes to serve me, saying that for that 
purpose he would put off* his journey back to Philadelphia, which otherwise was irrevocably fixed for Wed 
nesday, and would now, or at any time hereafter, go to 
Washington for me, where nothing he should ask would 
be refused him. In thanking him for the frankness and 
zeal with which he cautioned me against my friends, 
and a negligence of my safety, I assured him I was not 
afraid to meet the prosecution, as I expected I should, 
before my arrival here, without counsel or friends ; but 
from present appearances I was more curious than in 
terested to learn what were those means he said Government possessed of insuring justice? Finding by his 
answer he was now disposed to allure me into a con 
fession of having written certain papers in the hands 
of the prosecutors, I told him, " the warmth of his offers 
to serve me could not make me forget either his situation 
or my own, with relation to the Government; that I 
cared not what writings should he charged upon me, 
I should admit none until fairly proved, which, if any 
such should ever appear, I would justify, if necessary, 
on the scaffold. He now summed up the objects of his 
mission, whatever produced it, with ahuse of Burr, 
Tyler and Smith, acknowledging that he had heen 
served gratis hy the first, in the most handsome manner ; that the others were more concerned against the 
Government than I was ; hut swearing that he believed, 
if I did not follow his advice, they would make a scape 
goat sacrifice of me for their deliverance. Can I make 
no use, then, of this adventure ? yes, I will put this in 
terest in requisition, if I can't find readier means to 
abbreviate the imprisonment of Vaun. I have again laid 
by my brief, which I shall not probably soon resume 
until all my expectations of Burr's success and my own 
are reversed. In the mean time, I will attend to the 
adjustment of my private affairs. Ellis called in to-day, 
and seemed pleased with having it in his power to offer to 
spare some money to me, if I wanted it. I was very glad, 
I said, to find Col. Burr was in cash. " Not at all," said 
he ; "I was with the Marshal, and pretended a subpoena 
had been served on me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and got 140 odd dol 
lars. This was all Col. Burr could yet do for me." This 
is caution, with a vengeance.. The Marshal's runners 
have these two nights past been in busy search of General 
Dayton. If he is taken this way, how will he appear 
to the multitude? 
i 

MONDAY, AUGUST 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Between 8 or 9, A. M., arrived Major Smith in this 
place. He has got the room under me to sleep in, and 
no reasons of state or measures of public safety appear 
at present, though they were obvious three weeks ago, to 
prevent our living together until bed-time, that is, 8, P. M. 
He has not heard from Burr, though Mr. Martin has 
visited and offered him to be his counsel, gratis. I was 
visited by De Pestre, whom I was obliged to send away 
to attend to Nicholas, who will probably do something 
definite as to Sanders with Alston to-day or early to 
morrow. For, strange to say, the latter, De Pestre 
assured me, was going home to-day, but Nicholas says he 
will put it off until to-morrow. I apprehend I slaall be 
obliged to accept of that friendly invitation he gave me 
yesterday. Smith heard that Burr has made financial 
arrangements in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to settle every thing after 
his acquittal. Midnight. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

The unexpected arrival of Alston on the stairs before 
8 o'clock this morning, while I was walking with Major 
Smith in the passage, operated as a panic, and soon 
inspired a conviction of the apprehensions I entertained 
yesterday, after having seen De Pestre, that he would be 
off with French leave. I composed myself, however, to 
receive him with an air of confidence I have generally of 
late dissembled toward him, affecting at the same time a 
little surprise at so early a visit. This he parried, with a 
whiff of his cigar, which gave him time to think to say, 
" the court was to sit as early as nine, and he meant to 
lose nothing of all that was expected from Wirt, who 
would have the advantage of a good foil afforded him 
yesterday by the wretched exhibition of McRae, which 
soon became so flat, that it nearly cleared the Louse." 
" He affected," said he, " to prance at starting, but could 
only crawl all day over the ground ; even Hay confessing 
he did not understand the question, and Botts, who would 
next have spoken, declaring that he had heard nothing 
that required a reply from him. Alston now called me 
into my apartment to dispatch the object of his early 
visit, which seemed to be, to leave town without incurring 
any complaints of mine for not concluding, before his 
departure, the so long-expected arrangement with Nich 
olas. He therefore objected to the difficulties that he 
said Nicholas and Randolph pretended to feel in removing the attachment from my funds in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with 
out particular orders from Sanders. I said I should 
expect or coerce Sanders to do that, in virtue of the set 
tlements I had made with him in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, whether Mr. 
Alston furthered that settlement or not. He then said 
Nicholas yesterday promised to have the necessary papers 
ready last evening, but he would have me completely 
exonerated from the demand before he did anything; to 
which I, of course, assented. But, I asked, what had 
occasioned the determination I heard he had formed of 
leaving town yesterday or to-day? "0! the certainty 
of the trials ending this week had made him desirous of 
leaving this place, of which he was heartily tired, as soon 
as possible, and his anxiety to try to raise even a part of 
the money for my relief would the more hurry him away." 
He forgot, I suppose, he yesterday told Nicholas he had 
just received letters that suddenly called him home. A 
propensity to rely more on his wits than his memory, is a 
prominent trait in this character. It would, then, have 
answered no purpose to have inquired into the fact of the 
letters being concerned, rather than my sufferings, with 
the period of his journey. He could easily say, " "t was 
true, he had letters;" for he is very circumspect to avoid 
changes upon his words, which I took an occasion 
again to-day to put to the test by observing to him, that 
I supposed my losses by Miller's sale of my effects, which 
had been sacrificed in Wood county, would not be much 
short of 15,000, which sum would not replace two-thirds 
of my library, my furniture, instruments, house-linen, etc., 
with all my farming-stock and implements of husbandry, 
for all which I had no other hope of indemnity but what 
I could derive from the honor and resources of Col. Burr 
and himself; to all of which he was silent. But he might, 
and did, add, nothing more engaged his concern so much 
as his wishes to relieve my embarrassments. He then 
told me Col. Burr wished me to be upon my guard 
against spies, as he apprehended some had been lately 
visiting me under the mask of friendship. On asking 
him whether he alluded to any particular persons, I found 
he had heard of Duane's visit to me on Sunday evening, 
which was next day in every body's mouth, and may possibly have had some share in engendering a report which 
as yet has been only whispered, though it may have stolen 
into some of A. Burr's private audiences. This report 
states that I now see Burr in a different light from that in 
which I first regarded him, and that my fellow-prisoner, 
Major Smith, is come on determined to denounce Burr, 
and turn an approver. Alston did not hint this rumor to 
me, but I thought it would be serviceable to the interests 
of my pecuniary expectations from him to send him 
back to Burr, satisfied of my vigilance and perseverance 
in those duties of honor and good faith which, if they 
doubted in me, I should never forget I owe to myself. 
"Ha!" said I, "you 've heard of Duane's visit to me, 
then ; would you wish to see my notes of what passed 
between us?" " Yes," said he, eagerly, " very much in 
deed." I then read to him the minutes I had taken on 
Sunday evening, with which he seemed highly pleased, 
and said they ought to be published. To this I told him 
I could not accede, though it might seem to him the more 
necessary from some observations made to me by Duane, 
more than I thought necessary to enter in my notes, of 
which I recollected one, that concerned Alston himself, 
who now seemed all anxiety for the disclosure he ex 
pected. But I affected to attach little importance to the 
thing, and said, after no small enjoyment of his solicitude 
about it, " 't was only that Government had got possession of one of his letters to me." " One of my letters!" 
said he ; "I never wrote to you but two upon business of 
a private nature, and any other letter they can have of 
mine must be a forgery." " To be sure," said I ; "or at 
all events, from the favorable course things are now likely 
to take, such a letter could do no harm." " But what did 
the rascal," continued he, " state to be the purport of the 
letter ? " " Nothing more," said I, " than proving that 
you and myself were equally involved in all Col. Burr's 
projects." He then abused Duane, repeated his wish my 
notes were published, and took leave. 

I find I have omitted to observe, owing to the hurry 
and fatigue I suffered the day I arrived in this prison, 
that Alston, on his first visit to me that evening, acknowl 
edged the receipt of the letter I had written him from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, containing a reprobation of his public letter to 
Gov. Pinkney, when he said, " he felt now no uneasiness 
at certain reflections I had therein made use of, which he 
knew proceeded from a warmth of temper natural to me 
upon a misconception of his motives, which he had ex 
plained to the satisfaction (is it possible ?) of Col. Burr." 
To which I answered, that the letter itself would say it 
was not designed to excite any unpleasant sensations, 
though it was written under impressions that could not 
be obliterated, and that his not answering my letter, 
which was so incumbent on him, from the nature of that 
part of it relating to money matters, so irritated and con 
vinced me that he disregarded my expectations from him, 
arising from his guarantee for my losses by my concern 
with Col. Burr and himself, that I was further led' to 
declare, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, that he was as fully concerned 
with Col. B. as myself, stating at the same time to him a 
further motive for such a declaration, which will be found 
in my notes of the 6th instant. All this he accepted very 
kindly, assuring me he had written two letters to me. 
"What! two!" yes; he not only then, that is, on the 
fourth instant, said two, but said so again to-day. E"ow 
those who are blest with his correspondence, will find he 
is not in the habit of bestowing two answers on one letter, 
especially when that one has chiefly for its object to bring 
a demand upon him into action, much less to grant a sin 
gle reply to a letter which, through respect to his wife, 
he might at least acknowledge. I allude to our friend 
Harding's letter to him that he confessed he had received, 
but told me on his first visit it merely inclosed some papers 
to him, and required no answer. So the generous labors 
of the head and heart of one of the best men living did 
not deserve even the thanks of this coxcomb. But it 
appears from all this, that if his second letter was in 
answer to the only one I ever wrote him, his first was 
occupied with some other subject ; and the palpable interest with which he listened to the late news Duane left 
with me for him, joined with the motives that induced 
him to write the death-warrant of his character to Pinkney, and some late rumors of designs in Government, to 
institute a prosecution against him also, all leave little 
room to doubt that the prosecutors have got hold of 
something he would not like to see. But if this alarm 
will give me hold upon him, to keep him long enough 
here to carry some of his sincere wishes into execution, 
I shall owe Duane more obligations for his visit than he 
is aware of. I received a note from Prichard, covering 
the bill I had drawn on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> in his favor, which 
was returned for reasons already given in my notes of 
last Monday. Behold me, then, without a dollar, except 
the few that remain of thirty Prichard sent me a fort 
night since. On this very bill I have had my coat re 
paired, my umbrella newly covered, my hat dressed, and 
my boots new-tapped. But this economy will not pay 
my tavern bill, nor those of my grocer and washerwoman. Nor will it restore to me the only funds on 
which I depended for my only care, the maintenance of 
my family. My own wants will never solicit the mantle 
of charity to shelter them from the pinching blast of ad 
versity, until death shall lay the storm. Until then the 
cry, even to the heart of Mr. Alston, pray spare a trifle 
from your stock, to clothe my naked family, with that 
credit of which you Ve stripped it. In this spirit I wrote 
him what follows : " I have just received the inclosed, by 
which you may convince Mr. Nicholas of the unjust and 
absurd obstruction of my credit in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, by the 
continuance of Mr. Sanders's attachment. Having no 
other source of pecuniary supply to which I can resort 
for subsistence of my family, until I can collect the wreck 
of their property, I await the accommodation of such 
credit or remittances as your dispositions may devise for 
the relief of my exigences. Yours, H. B." The servant 
returned with a verbal answer, in these four words "He 
will see him," importing that Alston would see Nicholas, 
as if seeing N. will indemnify me for all I have suffered, 
or support my family. Alston told me Belknap has con 
fessed he received from Smith $700 for me, which he 
denied the night he arrived on the "Island" from Ken 
tucky, the night I left it. 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

The bird, I believe, has not flown to-day, but may take 
wing, I know not what moment. I have neither seen 
nor heard from him since his verbal answer to my letter 
of yesterday. The little animal has clapped its wings in 
screaming essays toward the " Oaks ;" but yet may it remain a little longer on that egg it has not yet hatched, 
for the cuckoo that laid it. Wirt raised his reputation 
yesterday, as high as McRae sunk his the day before. 
The former, I learn, paid me some compliments. We 
have many visitors, as usual, of whom I shall only notice 
Kerr, who sat one hour here this evening. Was cautioned 
by Dud. Woodbridge to beware of Bennet. But I have 
him secured by Tupper, who tells me he, Tupper, will 
support the declarations made by Bennet to him and me, 
on Bennet's first visit here to me. Major Smith is suffering something of a seasoning. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose at a quarter past 5 this morning, to walk in the 
yard, as I had agreed with Major Smith last night; but 
he rested badly, and had a profuse perspiration when I 
called upon him, which determined him, with my advice, 
to stay in bed. So I walked for an hour alone, under a 
disagreeable fog, with a view to try whether breathing so 
long another, if not a better, air than that of my room 
might not enable me to escape to-day a periodical head 
ache, with some fever, we both complain of about 2 
o'clock every day since Sunday, and of which we are not 
free some nights, before we go to bed. Young Swartwout 
called upon us with Alston. The latter called me out to 
tell me things will be completed to-day with Nicholas, 
from whom h.e will get the original bills on which the 
attachment was served on the house of J. S. Lewis & Co., 
as my garnishees, by which, I suppose, I can again open 
the channel of my credit which the attachment has so 
long shut up in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. He assures me Luckett's 
account is not admitted to be correct by Burr, and that I 
shall not be liable for the bill of $2,500 with my indorsement in Luckett's hands. He has also offered me a draft 
at sight on Charleston, for the bill returned me by Prichard. He concluded his money business with me this 
morning, by telling me Col. Burr will be soon in cash, 
having concluded some financial arrangements with a 
Mr. Pollock, who is very rich. I must not forget, how 
ever, he also told me his settling both Sanders's and Mil 
ler's claims, if the latter will come into the arrangement, 
will, with the incidental charges, require payments by 
him to the amount of $16,000 ; so that after settling San 
ders's claim, if Miller won't settle in the same way, he has 
proposed to take up his present letter of guarantee and 
give me another to indemnify me for what Miller may be 
entitled to recover of me, to which I have assented. Mr. 
Alston has found Wirt, though not without merit, so far 
as he was figurative, monotonous, with bad or no action, 
and better recommended by the foil McRae afforded him 
than any interest his late essay could inspire. He seems 
to-day to partake of apprehensions entertained by Col. 
Burr's friends, that the Chief Justice may yield to want 
of energy, in ruling all the points now before him, as the 
able efforts of the counsel for the defense can not fail to 
prove the law requires. Surely, if the law has not been 
mistaken on the side of the accused, the calumny which 
has been propagated through the crowd, of Burr's emissaries having made an attempt to take off Mr. Duncan 
by laudanum, would tend to strengthen rather the en 
ergies of such a head and heart as the Chief Justice is 
probably blessed with. This- Duncan has been brought 
here, I am told, to prove a negative ; namely, that "Wil 
kinson is not a Spanish officer or pensioner. Duane has 
kept his promise to abandon the field yesterday. I find 
to-day he is an expert angler, and adapts his flies and 
tackling not only to the waters and seasons of his choice, 
but to that kind of fish that are the objects of his sport; 
at least, the first cast of his line has caught that wary fish, 
the natural history of which has engaged so much of 
these notes. I have been accordingly informed, a formal 
demand has been made upon Hay to declare whether tire 
Government or himself possess a certain letter, of which 
a sketch has been given here the 25th instant. The scene 
that this interview probably presented will, I know not 
how long, be reserved for recital in the secret mysteries 
of the prosecution. Alston, on his part, gave me too 
sublime a rehearsal of the dignity and force with which 
he launched the bolts of his defiance on all the Titans of 
Virginia, for me to presume to imitate it in these memo 
randa, without incurring the suspicion at least of being 
disposed to burlesque it. The Titan Hay, however, he 
assured me, he overwhelmed with mountains of con 
sternation and dismay ; in short, the fact was denied, and 
what was very extraordinary, as the like never happened 
before, imprecations of mendacity, on the fame of Col. 
Duane, were endured with patience by Jefferson's attor 
ney. The existence, however, of the letter, be it remem 
bered, is as yet no more disproved than A.'s title to 
Agrestis is established. "When Alston observed to me, 
to-day, he would give me a new guarantee against the 
amount of Miller's recovery, I said, that would be necessary for two purposes ; first, for the purpose of transferring 
it, as I had the former one, to Sanders, or raising money 
on it, as I had nothing else left to pledge ; secondly, for 
the benefit of my family, in the event of my death, which 
I thought very probably might soon happen. I could see 
well enough to discern a pointed attention on his part to 
the last reason. He had on a former occasion observed, 
when I assured him I should publicly expose the perfidy 
and dishonor of Graham and the Hendersons, at all 
hazards, be the issue of these trials what it might, " that 
my short sight would lay me under very unfair disadvan 
tages ; " to which I answered, " I should know how to 
accommpdate the distance to the extent of my sight ; " 
and, to-day, he hoped with earnestness that I would not 
think on any gloomy subject to cloud the prospect of 
many happy years I shall yet enjoy. This was not his 
language, but his precise meaning ; how far it was sincere may be imagined from his talking in this way, after 
he returned me what another man might have kept, my 
letter given here the 25th instant, without lisping a syllable on the exposure I made to him in that letter of my 
second humiliation before his wealth, to solicit an atom 
from the heap to assuage the distress he is bound to 
relieve. Be it remembered, he has never questioned de 
mands I made upon him, independent of his first guaran 
tee for disbursements I have made for Col. Burr, to between four and five thousand dollars, in a letter of which 
he acknowledged the receipt on the 4th instant, any more 
than statements of other losses, an indemnity for which, 
when ascertained, will be sought in the honor and re 
sources of Col. Burr and himself. Tupper has promised 

me a copy of his song of the " Battle of the Boats," and 
24 
tells me the Hendersons now affect that they are obliged 
to testify against me. "When we recollect their menaces 
in Wood county to denounce me, after they had prosti 
tuted their honor to a spy, we must rather believe they 
regret to testify against that letter Sandy wrote his 
father, soliciting his consent to his son's espousing the 
principles and conduct, I confidentially recommended to 
them, which letter will show what treason I recommended or was engaged in. Robison and others tell us, this 
evening, Hay had the insolence to insinuate to-day, to 
the Chief Justice, an imp'eachment, if he did not over 
rule all the points now before the Court. Does the Chief 
Justice want energy at such a crisis to declare the law? 
surely this insult should give it to him. Prichard assures 
me Burr, on his acquittal, will not soon leave this town. 
Civil demands upon him will gather round him from all 
quarters, to a far greater amount than he can find bail 
for, if Pollock, or some other preserving angel, does not 
shield him from this new host. Then, indeed, will he 
fall more inglorious than from a gibbet. I am very 
unwell this evening, suffering under a return of the like 
oppressive weather I endured during the first fortnight 
of my imprisonment. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I awoke yesterday morning with a continuance of the 
indisposition under which I had labored on Thursday 
evening. I was affected with much fever and racking 
headache, to a degree of severity that compelled me to 
return to bed before breakfast, after taking three or four 
grains of calomel. Dud. Woodbridge called me aside 
this morning to complain that the " Enquirer " has mis 
represented the evidence he gave last Wednesday. He 
said he had been to the printer on the subject. I could 
not understand distinctly, however, what particular fact 
had been misstated. He observed to me that he was at a 
loss to conceive the object of the counsel on both sides, 
examining him upon matters altogether irrelevant to the 
questions before the Court; such as, his opinion of my 
talents and studies, his knowledge of the amount of my 
property, and particularly the value of my place on the 
Ohio. But he supposed the drift of Col. Burr was to 
show that I could in no sense be regarded as a military 
character. He apologized for his having said that " I 
had more other sense than common sense," an expression 
which he said escaped him in the hurry and warmth of 
his examination. I accepted this explanation, but wished 
him to inform me what motive the counsel could have to 
exhibit me to the jury as a character less skilled in the 
ordinary affairs of life than common men? He now 
stated to me, that Burr's special confidants, who formerly 
sought his company here, of late, seemed rather inclined 
to avoid him, for which he was at a loss to account ; but 
that, while he boarded in the same house with Bollman, 
this gentleman had devoted much pains to learn from 
him all he could of my character, by which, having ex 
tracted from him an opinion that I was eccentric, Boll 
man, who was informed of the testimony he had given 
before the grand jury, regretted very much that D. Woodbridge had not informed that body of the circumstance. 
All this is mysterious to me, and will remain so until I 
can explore the matter by opportunities I shall not fail to 
seek. I have had a large draft upon my little funds, of 
$2.55 for a large packet from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, covering the 
following inclosures ; namely, two letters from Elliott and 
another from his wife, with the seal cut open, and several 
others of importance. Burr yesterday informed me, by 
note, he had an unsettled account with Luckett, who holds 
one of his drafts for $25, with my indorsement, which it 
would gratify him much if I could discharge : but Alston, 
two or three days ago, assured me Luckett's account was 
not allowed, and I should not be called upon to pay this 
draft. Will these adventurers never meet but in du 
plicity ? Mr. Alston has not appeared to me since Thurs 
day; he is probably engrossed to-day by Martin's con 
cluding speech, in reply upon the points now before the 
Court. Wood, this morning, gave me some information, 
which, if true, proves Burr as bad a general out of the 
field as I have no doubt he would prove in it. Speaking 
of several characters that Burr had subpoenaed from Ken 
tucky, I inquired, what benefit he expected to derive fr^>m 
John Brown, who I heard had arrived ? " He can expect 
none from him," said Wood ; " he will find Brown more 
Wilkinson's friend than his." " Brown is as truly pen 
sioned as Sebastian was by the Spanish Government ;" 
and Col. Burr must have strangely overrated his own 
powers, if he ever thought that these men would have 
joined him in any thing but words against Spain, while 
he might with the greatest ease, when he was in Ken 
tucky, have enlisted Daveiss and the whole Marshall 
party in his interest. "Daveiss and Dr. Marshall," he 
added, " would gladly have embarked in all or any of his 
speculations; they had no Spanish ties to break, and 
Daviess instituted the first proceedings against him, partly 
from a sense of neglect on the part of Burr, and through 
enmity to the President, who he fully believed was con 
cerned with Burr, or connived at his operations. Be 
these things as they may, true or false, as "Wood is more 
or less deserving of credit it should be remembered that 
"Wood once possessed the confidence of the Marshall faction, by which he had an opportunity of knowing their 
dispositions that however unprincipled he may have 
proved in other instances, he still adheres to the denunci 
ations he published in the " Western World," which have 
already ruined Sebastian, and may yet lead to the conviction of other culprits, and that as he has now aban 
doned all concern with politics and newspapers, save so 
far as he can be serviceable to Burr, he can have no cal 
culable interest in depreciating the views or talents of any 
of the persons he has reflected upon. But the present 
trial can not fail to furnish ample testimony, if not to the 
guilt, at least to the defect of every talent, under the assumption of which this giddy adventurer has seduced so 
many followers of riper experience and better judgment 
than myself. You were right, therefore, honest Hay, in 
observing the other day to Woodbridge, while expressing 
your concern for my situation. " that I must now think 
Burr had duped me ; " but you were wrong in supposing 

I am indebted to you for the discovery ; I am possessed 
of it these nine months. I am still without relief of my 
anxiety for my poor family. I pray the mercy of Heaven 
to prepare me for the first news I shall hear from them. 

II o'clock, P. M. 



SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I have heard this morning from Ellis, that General 
Jackson is hourly expected in town, and Ashley's arrival 
also looked for, this evening or to-morrow. If by either 
of these chances I shall be blessed with no disastrous 
news of my family, or even with a revival of those hopes 
that I have too long brooded upon, of once more beholding the picture of my beloved wife, how great a load of 
care my hours of sorrow will throw ofi'. I trust Almighty 
God will first. ordain I shall bow with devout gratitude 
before I bound in levity or transports, to which I have 
so long been a stranger; or, if I idly dream, to wake 
perhaps to realities of sad reverse, then let me first 
invoke the Divine mercy, to retain me faithful to all my 
duties, in every task allotted to my destiny. I had a very 
interesting conversation this morning with John Banks 
and Mercer, and both eagerly charged themselves with 
the care of sending me good soup ; and as my late sickness induced me at their desire to complain of the quality 
of necessaries sent from the tavern, in pursuance of 
which, soon after, Mercer left me a present of refreshments of fruit and good butter, and fine calves-feet jelly, 
was sent in ice by Mrs. Gamble. The conversation, of 
course, had no other object so natural to engage our in 
terest as a com<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>on of the foundation of different con 
jectures respecting the decision the Chief Justice will 
deliver to-morrow on those points which have so long 
balanced this town between law and faction, and will so 
much longer poise the trembling passions of the distant 
multitude on the same pivot. Each of us was not without an inuendo, or an anecdote, of no small interest to 
Major Smith, who, I was happy to see, continued of the 
party. My hints were thrown out only in general terms, 
alluding to the inferences I had endeavored to draw from 
the intelligence Wood yesterday gave me. Mercer, who, 
it is said, is much enamored of a very accomplished 
young lady, a relation of the Chief Justice, ably exerted 
his happy address for some time, not indeed to confirm 
the sense Banks and myself professed we so fully entertained of General Marshall's high talents, deep erudition 
and amiable virtues, but to discharge our apprehensions 
of some doubts we said we lamented they had imbibed, 
that the Chief Justice would possess all the energy that 
would be necessary to reconcile the opinion he had deliv 
ered on the part of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Bollman and Swartwout, with such another as would be 
required of him to establish the most material of all the 
points now before him. Mercer insinuated he had oppor 
tunities from whence he could deduce a different antici 
pation. But neither Banks nor myself could hereby 
perceive his conjectures to be better warranted than our 
own. Banks was now led, after indulging himself with 
some general reflections on the difficulty and delicacy of 
the Chief Justice's present dilemma, in which we all 
concurred, to tell us an anecdote, with which I was sur 
prised to find Mercer unacquainted, from whence Banks 
indeed did not infer that the Chief Justice will, on the 
present occasion, shrink from his duty, as an able judge 
or a virtuous patriot, to avert the revenge of an unprinci 
pled government, or avoid other trials menaced, and 
preparing for himself by its wretched partisans, but he 
lamented, and certainly our choicest sympathies harmo 
nized witL his feelings, that the facts he had mentioned, 
of which he vouched the verity, referring Mercer to the 
office and file of the Argus, had already proved that the 
Chief Justice had explained or accommodated his en 
ergies on the bench in conformity to the views of his 
enemies, by ordering or permitting in his private character 
something to be inserted in the Argus, in the form of an 
apology to, or exculpation of, Wilkinson, purporting to 
contravene, but altogether inconsistent with, the tenor or 
expressions of declarations of opinions he, as a judge, 
had delived on the bench. This will, no doubt, engage 
Mercer's interest and anxiety so much that I will, to-day, 
add not a word to what I have already said, on a discov 
ery that has not a little depressed me. Yet I am certain, 
whatever dust or insects may have sought the Judge's 
robes while off his back, none will venture to appear 
upon the ermine that bedecks his person. Mercer and 
Banks gave me not less than two hours of their company, 
which, whether considered with regard to the elegance 
and interest of Mercer's conversation, or the friendly 
concern testified by Banks for the issue of the trial, con 
stituted one of the most agreeable visits I have received 
since my imprisonment. Mercer promised to bring me the 
earliest tidings of the decision to-morrow. Alston is too 
much occupied to call upon me, when such an effort is 
not indispensable. 

The influenza has arrived here, and found its way into 
half the families of the town. I am severely affected 
with it ; this is the third illness I have had here, which 
has compelled me to resort to medicine. As we were 
chatting over some of Mrs. Gamble's fruit after dinner, 
in came the whole rear-guard of Burr's forensic army I 
mean the celebrated Luther Martin, who yesterday concluded his fourteen hours' speech. His visit was to Major 
Smith ; but he took me by the hand, saying, there was 
no need of an introduction. I was too much interested 
by the little I had seen, and the great things I had heard, 
of this man's powers and passions not to improve the 
present opportunity to survey him in every light the 
length of his visit would permit. I accordingly recom 
mended our brandy as considered superior, placing a pint 
tumbler before him. !N"o ceremonies retarded the libation ; no inquiries solicited him on any subject, until 
apprehensions of his withdrawing suggested some topic 
to quiet him on his seat. Were I now to mention only 
the subjects of law, politics, news, etc., on which he de 
scanted, I should not be believed when I had said his 
visit did not exceed thirty-five minutes. I imagine a man 
capable, in that space of time, to deliver some account of 
an entire week's proceedings in the trial, with extracts 
from memory of several speeches on both sides, including 
long ones from his own, to recite half columns, verbatim, 
of a series of papers of which he said he is the author, 
under the signature of " Investigator," to caricature Jef 
ferson, give the history of his acquaintance with Burr, 
expatiate on his virtues and sufferings, maintain his credit, 
embellish his fame, and intersperse the whole with sen 
tentious reprobations and praises of other characters. 
Some estimate, with these preparations, may be formed 
of this man's powers, which are yet shackled by great 
embarrassment of delivery. In this his manner is rude, 
and his language ungrammaiical, which is cruelly aggra 
vated upon his hearers by the verbosity and repetitions 
of his style. With the warmest passions that hurry him 
like a torrent over those characters or topics of his con 
versation that lie most in the way of their course, he has 
by practice acquired the faculty of curbing his feelings, 
while he never suffers to charge the enemy until broken 
by the superior numbers of his arguments and authorities, 
by which he always outflanks him ; then he lets loose the 
reserve upon the center with redoubled impetuosity. Yet 
fancy has been as much denied to his mind as grace to 
his person or habits. These are gross, and incapable of 
restraint, even on the most solemn public occasions. 
Hence his invectives are rather coarse than pointed ; 
his eulogiums more fulsome than pathetic. In short, my 
amiable young friend Mercer, in his accustomed classical 
neatness, gives me every trait of his portrait, when in one 
word he calls him the " Thersites of the law." Yet, 
though Mr. M. did not intend to sit here to so bad an 
artist, he has literally promised me his portrait by a better hand ? and I believe he is not without mShy moral 
good qualities, not very inconsistent with the sketch I 
have attempted of his character. I have no doubt he is 
unrivaled for zeal in the service of his friends, while he 
retains them from the concern with which he spoke of 
Burr's financial difficulties, declaring his friend could find 
security in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> for $100,000, which I doubt, though 
I do not at all question Martin, as he said so, would be 
his bail for $10,000. I regret to find Smith neglected, not 
only by Burr, but Burr's satellites. I asked Martin if the 
prosecutors won't succeed, as I predicted by letter to B., 
before I got here to put him upon a defense on the trea 
son bill, that will nearly amount to a confession of the 
misdemeanor? I think this has actually happened. Mar 
tin thought that because Burr alleges he expected war 
between Spain and the United States, his expedition was 
lawful. But may not a jury think Burr did not expect 
the war, and find their verdict then on the confession ? 

MONDAY, AUGUST 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I suffered total privation of sleep last night, by the un 
remitting severity of my cough. This is the most 
oppressive day I have yet endured in this place, and my 
lassitude was so great, that after seeing Strickland, who, 
I am glad to hear, sets out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> about Saturday, I 
read for two hours, but was obliged to go to bed, where 
I slept until awaked by Mercer, with a report of the 
Chief Justice's opinion, stating, in substance, that all the 
points of so much expectation had been established in 
favor of the accused, and my indictment virtually got rid 
of, by the Judge's opinion, that the evidence adduced to 
prove the overt acts did not prove such an assemblage as 
the law required to constitute a traitorous one. Mercer 
took much pains to state every detail his memory could 
suggest ; but I was little revived with the news. I have 
yet too many other trials to pass. The Court adjourned 
to six o'clock this evening, when the prosecutors are to 
be prepared to state the course they will now pursue. 
The result I shall learn to-morrow morning, and be 
thereby probably enabled to look to the period of my 
imprisonment, When I shall have access to Burr and 
Alston, it will be my fault if I do not see them when I

ought. My chest is very sore; I will take some medicine, 
and endeavor to sleep, after first offering up my cares and 
prayers to Heaven for my wife and boys. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This morning I find my influenza much abated by the 
good effects of the medicine I took last night. Visited, 
as usual, by a variety of persons, before and after the ad 
journment of the Court, by whom we learn, Hay observed, 
with an affectation of terseness, that he had examined 
the opinion of the Court, and had no further arguments 
or evidence to offer, by which I should understand he 
meant to envelop in uncertainty the course the prose 
cutors will now pursue, of which no conjecture can be 
formed before to-morrow. A diversity of opinions, how 
ever, seems already to dissect the speculations of the 
prosecutors ; some supposing all the indictments will be 
abandoned by nolle-prosequis ; others, that Burr will be 
proceeded against immediately on the misdemeanor ; and 
some more, that a motion will be made to have him sent 
to the District of Kentucky, where things may work 
more favorably to convict him of overt acts, suggested to 
have been committed by him at the mouth of Cumber 
land river ; while, on the other hand, it is said, Burr will 
to-morrow move for nothing less than to be discharged 
from the indictment for the misdemeanor. But this 
seems to me too bold a dash on the part of the accused. 
I should rather presume, on the contrary, that the Judge 
would allow the prosecutors all the latitude of discretion 
they may desire in adducing evidence to prove that de 
gree or probability of guilt that may induce the Court to 
transmit the accused to another district, from which they 
had precluded themselves by the form in which they had 
framed the indictment for treason. Yet I can not "believe 
the Chief Justice will ever say, a man once put in jeop 
ardy of life in one district for treason, charged to have 
"been therein committed and acquitted thereof, may after 
ward be put to answer charges of other overt acts of the 
same treason in another district. Though a man may be 
responsible to the law, in twelve districts severally, for a 
distinct treason committed in each, provided the animus 
or design quo (with which) he sought his object by the overt 
acts in each be proven to have operated the overt acts, as 
their immediate preceding motive, within the district 
where they are laid in the indictment to have been com 
mitted. Thus, a man may successively meditate, andmentally organize or arrange, eleven separate treasons, iu 
as many States, the execution of all which he may aban 
don ; but finally, in a twelfth, he may attempt to reduce 
his project into action. But evidence of overt acts in the 
last State can not borrow evidence of the design from any 
of the former to complete his crime. The jury, I hope, 
have to-day evinced more of caprice than party spirit, by 
affecting to bring in something like a special verdict of 
acquittal. It will, however, be entered generally on the 
record. Burr has written to me to solicit Alston to assume the amount of the bill Luckett holds, and felicitates 
me on the events of yesterday. I have gratified Luckett 
with a letter to that effect to Alston, whom I have not 
seen since Thursday. 
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

My cough still causing me some loss of rest, I had not 
risen this morning before seven, when I was visited by 
Wickham and Botts. They staid about fifteen minutes, 
and called to acquaint me they meant to-morrow to offer 
the special plea to my indictment, on which account they 
had come to invite me to visit the folks at the capitol. 
They told me Burr was not solicitous about his discharge, 
which they thought would not take place for three or 
four days. They apprehended an attempt would be made 
to have us all transmitted to the Kentucky or other dis 
tricts, which they did not appear to think would prevail. 
After breakfast, being very languid, we did nothing but 
read until a little after noon, when a Deputy Marshal un 
expectedly roused us into action, by a summons to attend 
the Court. We dressed in five minutes, and accompanied 
the officer in a distressing warm walk. We did not re 
turn till the Court adjourned, about half-past four. On 
our arrival, the Court seemed disengaged, as if it had 
been waiting for us. During this pause I could only collect from Botts, that some motion was before the Court, 
which he had not time to explain, before Hay rose to ob 
serve, that as Major Smith and myself were present, and 
as we were similarly circumstanced with A. Burr, the 
same course should be pursued with us all. This called 
up Botts, who was followed by Wickham, both in very 
able arguments, contending that our cases were totally 
separate and distinct from Burr's ; the latter not being 
now, on account of his acquittal of the treason, legally 
present before the Court ; the only proper means to bring 



him there, to answer to the indictment for the misde 
meanor, being, by summons or venire facias, according to 
the laws and practice of Virginia, where process of capias 
is not allowed for any offense less than capital. Burr 
said he was ready to enter an appearance to the indictment for the misdemeanor, insisting, until he did so, he 
was not legally in court on that charge; from whence I 
inferred, that the motion made before my arrival was 
probably for his discharge under the proclamation that 
should have ensued, on recording the verdict yesterday 
of his acquittal. Wickham and Botts supported their 
arguments with not only English and Federal authorities, 
but with the doctrines of Hay himself, delivered by him 
in his evidence on Chase's trial, which they dressed up in 
such comments and strictures as exhibited Hay the most 
bewildered spectacle of confusion and mortification I 
ever saw exposed to a public assembly. The Chief Justice 
said he should proceed to assign counsel to Major Smith 
for which purpose the latter got me to write a letter 
for him yesterday if the counsel of the United States 
meant to proceed against him on his treason bill, to which 
Hay answered, " it would be unnecessary, he believed." 
The Judge then observed, that the arguments would 
require his postponing his opinion until to-morrow morn 
ing. After the Court was adjourned, Burr and ourselves 
were detained about ten minutes by the absence of the 
Marshal and his deputies, who had stepped aside some 
where out of my sight, I believe, upon some consultation 
respecting the expense of Burr's guard until to-morrow ; 
for I soon heard Burr tell Botts he would pay the ex 
pense himself. The guard over him, at his present 
quarters, has hitherto cost the United States seven dollars 
a day, which, it is now understood, he must pay himself 
until discharged, since his life has been redeemed from 
the mortgage the Government had on it. Burr, during 
this detention, said he hoped he should be able to come 
to see us to-morrow or next day ; but I fancy we shall 
have the liberty of the town as soon as his highness ; and 
so after all, it is one hundred to one, I shall never be ever 
arraigned for treason. On entering the dome of the 
capitol I was indemnified for the severity of my walk, 
not merely by the pleasure of the transition from the 
heat abroad to the shade and lower temperature of that 
part of the building, but by the enjoyment of beholding 
a face I had not yet seen in town. I passed close by 
Phelps, whose visage exhibited so high-colored a picture 
of the disappointment of his malice, that I involuntarily 
smiled upon him with such satisfaction as almost tempted 
me to wish him joy. My hurry, however, did not permit 
me to speak. I must reserve my words for something 
more human. Tupper expects letters this evening. I 
have charged Billy to see him, and be with me as early 
as he can. If I but wake to good tidings from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, 
how shall I sacrifice to the God of fathers, for his pre 
servation of my Harman, whom I have again dreamed I 
have lost. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I opened my eyes first this morning in quest only of 
that object, in exclusion of all others, that occupied my 
heart last night. But instead of letters through General 
Tupper, Billy brought me early a note from him, to announce that there were three letters from my wife, not 
here, arrived for me, but at Marietta. To Almighty God 
be first offered my grateful and humble thanksgiving. I 
am hereby enabled to conjecture, with much probability, 
my beloved wife, at least, was well about the middle of 
July. But I dare not so far presume upon the favor of 
Providence as to conclude my boys, particularly Harman, 
were in health at that period, much less, how long they 
and their mother have since continued well. This note 
has given me, however, a vivacity to-day, in spite of the 
oppressiveness of the weather, I have not before experienced in this prison, where, it is true, my friends have 
sometimes made me bear a part in the humor or interest 
of the story ; but I have ever felt on such occasions in the 
state Nicholas described, when he gives us the account 
of that part of his life during which he was conscious 
of being under the influence of two minds at the same 
instant. Or, at least, my heart would pity the momentary 
fluttering of my spirits, which, on such occasions, could 
never soar above its trouble. That truly worthy Irish 
man, Mr. Hendren, has come again to town, apparently 
on purpose to see me. (See notes of 8th ult.) If I shall 
be detained here, as is probable, for some time, after I 
shall be bailed or discharged, I have engaged to visit him 
at Shirley, twenty miles from here. Not having seen any 
one since the rising of the court this evening, we are 
without any knowledge of the proceedings there to-day. 
Luckett called, this morning, to tell me Alston required 
me to write to him again, to desire he would settle or 
assume the amount of the bill Luckett holds, with my 

indorsement, saying my last letter to him on Monday to 
25 
do so, did not express my desire with sufficient certainty. 
This is admirable ! Major Smith has seen that letter, and 
only wanted to hear this statement by Luckett, which, if 
true, settles Mr. Alston's intentions and mine. The first 
to put off, the last to hasten ; if he leaves this town, with 
out his having reasons I shall approve of for not making 
the settlements he has undertaken, my purpose is fixed to 
follow him to the " Oaks " with a friend, very soon after 
my discharge, when it shall not exceed forty-eight hours 
to conclude all my business with him. I have written to 
William Thompson a long letter, accepting his tender of 
a correspondence, and returning him my sincere disposition to improve our acquaintance into a friendship. Re 
curring with Mr. Smith to some incidents that happened 
soon after our arrival at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and speaking of Cowles 
Meade, I was much surprised to learn what I had never 
heard before, that Meade had seriously taken up an idea 
of Col. Burr's being then deranged, alleging that he 
could not be mistaken, as he, Meade, had very long 
known him. Be this as it may, Burr, yesterday, looked 
fifty per cent, better than I have ever seen him, and dis 
played a command of tone and firmness of manner he 
did not appear to me to possess before the verdict of 
Tuesday. 11, P. M. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Visited this morning by Ellis and Doctor Monholland, 
who inform us yesterday was spent in Court in a desultory 
disputation on Hay's attempt, moved or suggested to 
have Burr transmitted to the Kentucky District; on 
which- the Chief Justice has yet made no rule, as they 
understand he conceives the indictment for the misde 
meanor must be first got rid of here. They also tell us 
Burr went out about 1 o'clock to procure bail, which 
they supposed he did not effect, as his guard were in 
statu quo this morning. I have written a thankful letter 
to two : I have received one from Jas. O. Hennessy, a 
Kerry schoolmaster, who appears to be settled as a private 
tutor in the family of Hudson Martin, Esq., near York 
Post-office, Albemarle county, and is very solicitous to 
serve me. Read the best part of this morning, as is 
generally my practice when not otherwise employed, and 
which will show I have not been idle, wherever it might 
appear by this diary the minutes of any particular day 
are few or uninteresting. Hay has made a special return 
instanter, to a subpcena, duces-tecum, ordering him to produce a letter from Jefferson to Wilkinson, which Hay 
did not wish made public, as parts of it were confidential. 
But his return was not accepted, and he has been co 
erced to produce the letter. The whole day has been 
spent in altercation on this subject, and the question 
whether evidence should be gone into to determine upon 
the transmissal of us all to another district, before our 
indictments for the misdemeanor are ,here disposed of. 
In Burr's case, the Chief Justice has determined his dis 
charge from his treason bill, and ordered his trial for 
the misdemeanor to proceed directly. 11, P. M. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Burr is to-day to give bail to the misdemeanor, the 
Chief Justice having yesterday determined a capias is the 
proper process, and not a summons, on grounds I ana 
ignorant of. The sum was settled at $5,000, Burr having 
prayed it might he reduced below what it had heen for 
merly fixed at since his acquittal ; and his heing in cus 
tody on civil process, altered his situation, and now made 
it more difficult for him to find hail than before. Strange ! 
I should never before have heard of this arrest on civil process having been made upon him, and still being unremoved. I observed to Alston, who has just left me, that 
I found by to-day's papers, Col. Burr and the Judge had 
both referred to this circumstance as influential in settling 
the quantum of the bail. He did not like it, and asked, 
peevishly, ""What is it the papers will not talk about?" 
This man, with his most active associates, Bollman and 
Sam. Swartwout, to whom probably young Dayton may 
now be added, has, I believe, been more active with every 
thing than his purse to serve the interests of Burr ; his 
industry enabled him, rather than his judgment or 
knowledge of the subject, to anticipate the opinion of the 
Chief Justice on the late arguments of an entire week, 
long before any body else scarcely would venture an opin 
ion, or conjecture about it. And if the Coryphcd of the 
prosecution were solicitous to collect, from every opportunity they could derive from the Judge's conduct, materials 
to fabricate an impeachment against him, the Triumviri 
above mentioned were not less busy in their preparations, 
by rumors or publications, to arraign him for timidity be 
fore the tribunal of public opinion, in case his judgments 
had been adverse to their wishes. Notwithstanding the 
dignity and independence of the Judge's mind, I suspect 
from some hints dropped to me by Mercer, Mr. Marshall 
early perceived his course lay between Scylla and Charybdis, though he equally disregarded the dangers that men 
aced him on either side. Again, Alston has detected, by 
his spies, some curious governmental manoeuvres, that 
have been going on in Kentucky, nothing less than prep 
arations by Bibb, the District Attorney there, for our 
prosecution in that State to be instituted, if not already 
commenced, the moment we are discharged here, provided 
only the necessary witnesses can be trained and suborned, 
and a grand jury packed for the purpose. Alston assures 
me the grand jury was actually to have been embodied 
yesterday, if the scheme had succeeded, of which he expected to be advised by Monday. Hence we learn to ac 
count for Hay's delays, to dismiss the other treason bills 
here, which he may yet possibly proceed upon, though 
he has declared he would enter nolle prosequis if he finds 
his speculations in Kentucky likely to miscarry. Why 
else has Major Smith been served to-day with copies of 
his indictments ? Alston tells me, Duncan was yesterday 
evening examined upon interrogatories by consent, by 
Burr and Botts, preparatory to his, Duncan, leaving town 
to-day. The object was to obtain matter to discredit 
Wilkinson. It is pretended Duncan has proved Wilkin 
son guilty of forgery, in erasing and altering the cipher 
letter. But I do not place implicit reliance on the full 
extent of this statement. Burr's guard, it is added, will 
be dismissed to-day. But the business of bailing may 
undergo some procrastination, I suppose, if any part of it 
depends upon expectations from Alston, who has not 
to-day said a word to me upon money matters, from 
which I do by no means imagine he has yet concluded 
any thing with Nicholas or Luckett. I was not sorry he 



390 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

did not call me out. I shall not forget to construe his 
silence upon my last note to him, to settle with Luckett 
for the bill as an acceptance of one demand, at least, 
beyond the limits of his letter of guarantee. Though had 
he spoken to me in private, I was prepared to express to 
him my surprise at the freedom he used in speaking of 
what passed during my visit from Duane, after I had 
apprised him I did not wish it published ; also, to warn 
him of my being acquainted with the officious inquiries 
his friend Bollman had been making about me, and to ac 
quaint him, that though his agent in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> would 
probably exonerate me from one of the attachments, yet 
he had not paid the bill, in the manner stated to me on a 
former occasion. (See notes of 27th and 29th ult.) 

Since writing the above, before dinner, I find this evening I have been much mistaken in my conjectures of the 
morning respecting the hero of these notes. Luckett has 
just stepped off with Alston's letter of guarantee to me, 
on which I have seen a special receipt from Nicholas to 
him, for a bond and mortgage. Luckett brought it to me 
to request I would also endorse on it an order to settle his 
demand for the bill, which I did very readily. The news 
by this arrival is, that Burr, besides his bail already mentioned, procured security to-day, also, for $30,000, in civil 
suits, which have been here commenced against him ; that 
he enjoyed a long walk this evening with Mrs. Alston, 
in which he exhibited himself through the greater part of 
the town, and will probably honor me with a visit to-mor 
row. It is again threatened that Alston will be off to 
morrow, but not without seeing me ; I fancy he will, in 
case he comes pour prendre congS, take away with him, 
from my valediction, more matter of reflection for him to 
ponder on, at the Oaks, than has yet troubled him on my 
account. Half past 10, P. M. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

As I learned yesterday, which I 've omitted to mention, 
that Burr's trial for the misdemeanor had been ordered 
by the Court to commence to-morrow, the uncertainty of 
its duration has caused me no small uneasiness, lest it 
might prolong my imprisonment until the period of its 
termination. This apprehension has led me this morning to suggest, by note to my counsel, the expedient of 
my pleading in abatement to both my indictments, to 
morrow morning on the opening of the court, at once 
before the trial begins. I have had a short line in answer 
from Botts, saying, he will this evening confer with Ran 
dolph and Wickham, and endeavor to have me brought 
into court, pursuant to my desire. My speculation, on 
the success of this manoeuvre, opens to me a prospect of 
no small interest and amusement, as it may affect the 
recovery of my liberty, at least for a time, and promises 
to occasion no little embarrassment to the prosecutors, 
who can not, I believe, support a demurrer to the plea, 
which when established will, of course, destroy both of 
the present indictments against me, and thereby reduce 
Hay to the dilemma of seeing me fully discharged by the 
Court, or oblige him to apply for a recommitment, in 
order to have me transmitted to another district. But to 
open and examine the evidence from which alone he 
could exhibit even the semblance of probable' cause to 
induce the Court to grant such a motion, would occasion 



392 THE BLENNERHASSET? PAPERS. 

such an interference and obstruction of Burrs trial now 
pending, that he must be inevitably distanced, unless he 
can prevent my pleading until the present trial is at an 
end, which I also expect he will fail in, because I conceive 
it a matter of right that I should plead when I am ready 
to do so. Besides, the Court will have sufficient leisure ; 
for I understand from Mercer and Kerr, that Burr's trial 
will not, in fact, commence before Tuesday, or perhaps 
Wednesday. These gentlemen, in giving me this intelligence this morning, acquaint me with some curious circumstances, which have occasioned the expected suspen 
sion. It seems, after Hay's special return to the subpoena 
duces-tecum on Friday, stating that he deemed certain 
parts of Wilkinson's letter, of 12th of November, to Jef 
ferson, confidential, which he therefore could not part 
with, etc., was held insufficient, after an animated discussion by the Court, which threatened to enforce Mr. Hay's 
compliance with its orders. He then begged time to learn 
Wilkinson's pleasure, as to his producing the letter. 
Yesterday, however, he took new ground, and prayed to 
amend his return, which now set forth, " that on a further perusal and examination of the said letter, he dis 
covered it contained some secrets of state, whereupon he 
prayed time to obtain Jefferson's consent or dissent to his 
producing it." Four days, I am told, is the extent of the 
time allowed for his receiving an answer from Monticello. 
But it is a little curious, that in order to learn his master's 
pleasure he should send the letter to him, which I am 
assured he has actually done, so that we may, by possi 
bility, be gratified with the scene that may ensue 011 Jef 
ferson's heroism, opposing his shield to the onset of the 
Chief Justice upon his attorney. But the bewildered 
Hay has, in the mean time, " let the cat out of the bag ;" 
for the great secret of state is now all over the town. It 
happened thus. While the guardian of state secrecy and 
private confidence was yesterday descanting before the 
Court on the sacred obligations of these duties, the deities 
or demons of theft and discord, combining with the evil 
genii of Jefferson and Hay, directed the keen scent and 
piercing eye of a vulture to that prey most natural to his 
appetite. John Graham, whose name may find a place 
perhaps in the history of the present administration, from 
his exploits as a spy and informer in their service, politely 
stepped up to the table where the letter lay, and while 
Hay was earnestly defending the inviolable secrecy of its 
contents, this " Bird of Paradise " was pecking at the for 
bidden fruit. The example was followed by other fowl, 
I know not how far, of the same feather. But some 
magpies, I find, were so delighted with the fruit, of which 
they had eaten in the same manner, that they flew through 
the streets in the evening, intoxicated with its flavor, and 
chattering the words, "Militia traitors!" These fine 
birds could not speak in detail of all the sweets on which 
they had regaled themselves ; yet can they rival that cel 
ebrated parrot that detected a Prince of Orange incog., 
and squall, when a little man passes by them, "Great 
General." The oracles of intrigue, however, at the capitol, have been resorted to on this occasion, who have 
answered, " that a great General expressed his opinion, 
as a secret of state, that the Mississippi and Orleans mil 
itias should not be trusted." I am a little pleased with 
this anecdote, and have some thoughts of giving it to the 



394 THE BLENNEBHASSETT PAPERS. 

public. I find Tupper and many other witnesses aro 
about to return home, some being discharged as they 
arrived ; i. e., unexamined, some having, by consent of 
parties, left their affidavits. I am inclined to infer, from 
these appearances, that poor Hay rather feels craw-sick, 
than that he is not yet fully gorged with the banquet of 
professional fame, at which he has made so long a sitting. 
As for McRae, he is utterly chop-fallen ; an object of dis 
gust to his friends, and pity to his enemies. Luther Mar 
tin sat some time with us this morning. He said he 
came to see his client Major Smith ; but his vanity as an 
author and a father led him to bring me his strictures on 
the barbarous and sanguinary toasts that were drank on 
the Fourth of July, against Burr and himself, at Elktown, 
in Maryland, and also to read two letters from two of his 
daughters. His retort on the toasters is a good philippic 
on their bloody ignorance of the law, but a mass of verbi 
age, engrossing more than one page of a paper, the points 
and arguments of which might all be neatly expressed in 
half a column. He improves in interest, as I get a nearer 
view of his sensibilities, through which he shines far 
brighter as a father or a friend than he will ever appear 
through his oratory or his writings as an advocate or an 
author. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This day, at 11 o'clock, A. M., ended my captivity, 
which has lasted fifty-three days. I was taken down to 
Court about ten o'clock, when Mr. Botts called upon Hay 
to know what he meant to do with my treason-bill, which 
Hay agreed to have discharged, but required my detention in custody on the indictment for the misdemeanor, 
which produced a conversation on the subject of bail, 
during which D. Woodbridge offered me his services. 
After an examination on the amount of his property, he 
was accepted as my security in $5,000, myself being bound 
in the same sum, on condition that I attend the court on 
Wednesday, and not depart the same from day to day, 
without license, until discharged. John , Banks had also 
come up to court to assist me in the way of bail. He 
afterward accompanied me in quest of a lodging, which 
I have found at a Mr. Walton's, who seems a good sort 
of man, and will, upon my solicitation, if necessary, come 
forward to-morrow to bail Major Smith, though L. Mar 
tin will take that friendship on himself. We then re 
paired to the Post-office, where I was made happy by a 
letter from my beloved wife, of the 3d ult., whom the 
favor of Almighty God permitted the blessing of her 
health, and that of our boys. I then visited Aaron Burr, 
now settled in the house occupied lately by Alston, who 
has at last gone off this morning in the way he has so 
long threatened, that is, without taking leave. In the 
evening, I returned to the Penitentiary to visit Major 
Smith, and, after acquainting him with my having provided more agreeable quarters for him, I came away with 
L. Martin, and took up my abode at my lodgings, under 
a severe headache, the forerunner of another day's sickness, which I shall probably undergo to-morrow. But it 
is just the happiness conferred by a letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> 
should be tempered with an alloy. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
As I apprehended on Monday night, I spent yesterday 



396 THE BLENNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

in bed, under much fever and sickness. In the morning, 
I fortunately begged Mr. Walton to take my cloak, as he 
was an invalid, and it was very rainy, and step up to 
court, in case of his assistance being wanted to bail Major 
Smith. Mr. W. had on Monday agreed, after much 
solicitation on my part, to come forward as the Major's 
bail, if necessary. But as I had some slight fears of 
Martin's forgetting engagements he had made while in 
his cups, thought it most prudent to have Walton on the 
spot, and the event justified my prudence; for though 
Martin had not forgotten his promise, he was incapable 
of executing it, through the effects of yesterday morn 
ing's potations. I was informed by Major Smith, that 
had not Mr. Walton arrived when he did, the Court 
would very soon have remanded him for want of bail, 
Martin having in vain endeavored to express his purpose, 
in which Burr interrupted him, not liking the statement 
he was trying to make to the Court, though Martin 
would gladly have entered bail to any amount, for he is, 
I am now convinced, one of the best-hearted men alive. 
I slept badly last night, and am very weak to-day, though 
I have attended my place in court, where the trial of 
Burr proceeded on the misdemeanor, Hay having pre 
sented from Jefferson a mutilated copy of Wilkinson's 
letter, out of which Jefferson has reserved all the parts 
alleged to be confidential, in disregard of the opinion of 
the Court rejecting the special return to the subpO3na 
aleady offered to that effect by Hay. How far the Court 
will accept from Jefferson, what it has refused from Hay, 
will not appear until the fate of six points, made by Botts 
to-day, to arrest all further evidence in this case similar 
to what was done in the treason case, shall be determined. 
The arguments on this motion will not probably be 
closed before the end of the week. I had, this evening, 
a pretty long tete a tte with Burr, during which General 
Dayton was sequestered in another room. This old sly 
boots, or Burr, who is often closeted with him, did notmention a hint of my seeing him, though Burr had the 
candor to tell me, when I was taking leave, he would 
return to General Dayton in the next room ; so that 
both were equally conscious I should despise the intro 
duction. Our conversation turned altogether on the 
subject of my involvment in pecuniary claims upon him, 
in which I represented distinctly, and with firmness, that 
I should expect indemnity from him for every loss I 
might incur by his paper or my disbursements for him, 
specifying to him, at the same time, many instances in 
which my property on the Ohio had already been sacri 
ficed on those accounts, and adding, that I particularly 
held Alston answerable to me for any bills, with the 
charges upon them, which I might have indorsed beyond 
the amount of Alston's guarantee to me by letter, unless 
Burr would settle such claims. He assured me he would 
adjust all such demands, whenever he can be freed from 
the present prosecutions, and can have reasonable time to 
collect his resources ; until when, he expressed a desire 
that I should employ Jacob Burnet, now here, to procure 
as much procrastination of execution on Miller's attachment as he can, Alston having got Nicholas and Luckett 
to accept of his paper for their demands to the amount 
of $12,500, with charges. I will have one more consultation with Burr before I make my first demand upon 
Alston for the balance of his guarantee by letter, which 
will be $2,500, at least. When that is disposed of, I shall 
meditate upon other demands, on his verbal guarantee to 
me. 10 o'clock, P. M. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I have, this morning, conferred with J. Burnet, who 
tells me Miller may be delayed in effecting sales against 
me in Ohio for twelve months to come. I have also en 
gaged him to act as my attorney in Ohio Federal Court, 
against old Woodbridge. The Court heard Bolts and 
Martin argue further on Botts's motion, and adjourned 
early, on account of the absence and indisposition of 
some of the other counsel. I then enjoyed a further 
repast, prepared for me by my beloved wife, which had 
been withheld, I know not how long, from me. It was 
the letters she had addressed to me at Marietta, with 
others inclosed in them, to the amount of nine dollars 
postage. These being without dates, I knew they must 
be old. The profiles they inclosed of my dear boys were 
morsels of such exquisite and uncloying flavor, that they 
have developed within me sensations of delight I did not 
know I possessed. How many parts of all the lines and 
curves of these dear heads I shall scan and reflect upon, 
in many a precious reverie, it is given to few besides 
myself to care or comprehend. But did I truly know 
my patience had obtained for me any particular bless 
ing, among the many I derive alone from a beneficent 
Providence, then how much better should I know the 
pre-eminent value of that blessing, and study the holy 
tenure by which I could preserve it. I will never dare to 
ask, but will receive from Divine dispensation, in this 
sense, its permission of the health and comfort of my 
little family, which I yet know not, but beseech Almighty 
God to teach me how I may deserve it. I went this 
evening to the Harmonic Society, at which I could not 
assist for want of my spectacles. The vice-president 
requested I would consider myself an honorary member 
while in town. The flutes are good, with four moderately good violins, two tenors, two bass players, one 
telerably good and three excellent singers, who performed 
some charming trios of Doctor Calcott's, new to me, and 
composed for some affecting extracts from Ossian. The 
instrumental music was all old, and known to me. I 
passed a pleasant evening, and came away at 12. Next 
Thursday I shall take a part. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Saw Burnet again this morning, and showed him Al 
ston's letter of guarantee, which I assigned to Sanders, 
and is now returned to me, by his agent Nicholas, with 
the latter's receipt indorsed upon it for Alston's paper, 
which he has taken in satisfaction of his principal's 
demand. I have written to Lewis, to state this settlement, and hope it will restore my credit with his house, 
from whence I have requested a remittance of $200, as 
I am in debt and without funds. Court, to-day, was 
occupied with further arguments on Botts's points. I 
heard Wirt for the first time. He is a handsome speaker, 
but faulty in his figures, rather through defect of study 
than genius. Edmon-d Randolph followed on the other 
tide; he has suffered a depression, in manner and 
matter, of fully one-half, since I saw him display here 
in 1800. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Randolph finished his argument this morning, and was 
as labored, inanimate and uninteresting as on yesterday. 
He advanced nothing new, except an objection to the in 
dictments not setting forth with sufficient certainty that 
the expedition was carried on from the United States, 
pursuant to the manner in which the offense is described 
in the statute ; as he insisted, in the present indictment, 
the words " from thence " referred to the Island, and not 
to the United States. The point seemed to me a good 
one, and the Chief Justice took a note of it. Martin 
followed for two hours, and was, besides being clear in 
his positions, though, as usual, totally regardless of ar 
rangement, less cumbrous than in common with his 
verbiage. But Wickham, who closed on that side, ex 
hibited a masterpiece of strong, condensed argumentation, followed with a severe, but measured philippic on 
the motives, ignorance and misconduct of the prose 
cutors. This occasioned such agitation to Hay, who was 
alone hardy enough, of the three on that side, to with 
stand the impression, that he declared his feelings ought 
no.t to be trusted with the duty imposed on him, to offer 
remarks on expressions so unprovoked and unmerited, 
which Mr. Wickham would retract. He therefore re 
quested to be heard on Monday ; the Court then immediately adjourned. But I trust the Judge will not allow 
Hay to prove what he can alone do ; namely, Tutius est 
igitur fictis contendere verbis quam pugnare manu. I have 
this evening progressed with letters to A. Martin, so long 
delayed. (See notes of the 29th ult.) Should I ever succeed to the large estates which Martin supposes now awaits 
me, who would imagine, that did not know my indifference to wealth, I should be so careless of it. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I was this morning informed by Mr. "Walton, a gentle 
man had arrived in town last night from the country, 
who had come a considerable distance to see me, and 
would call at 9 o'clock. I therefore staid within to 
receive him certain it must be either Mr. Hendren or 
O'Hennessy and was called upon to the minute, when a 
stranger appeared somewhat agitated. I inquired whether 
it was Mr. O'Hennessy I had the pleasure to receive, and 
being answered in the affirmative, I invited him up stairs. 
This man, I soon found, who had seen me only once or 
twice in Kerry, when I was one of the counsel attending 
John Crosbie's election, I believe, in 1793, who had never 
spoken a word to me in his life until this day, has suffered many a sleepless night through his anxiety for me 
under the present prosecutions, and the first moment he 
learned he could have a chance of seeing me, he set out 
and rode 105 miles for the purpose. This is not all ; he 
intreats me to suffer him to follow me to any indefinite 
distance, declaring he regards it as the first object of his 
heart to settle near me. He has no capital; but, as a 
schoolmaster and a skillful dealer in horses, can command 
the means of a comfortable livelihood any where in 
America. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> he can soon get rich. He will, 

therefore, accompany me with a Mr. O'Connor, a mathe26 
matician, who will follow his fortune, so that I have 
secured a good tuition for my boys in the dead languages, 
English, and the elementary branches of the sciences, 
until a prospect of bettter means for their advancement 
may be more clearly opened in Europe the only con 
tingency that can draw me from the Mississippi. O'Hennessy has besought me to command a fine horse, and 
what money he can raise. The latter I have thankfully 
declined. I visited Burr this morning ; he is as gay as 
usual, and as busy in speculations on reorganizing his 
projects for action as if he had never suffered the least 
interruption. He observed to Major Smith and me, that 
in six months our schemes could be all remounted ; that 
we could now new-model them in a better mould than 
formerly, having a clearer view of the ground, and a 
^more perfect knowledge of our men. We were silent, 
feeling the full force of his last remark on men ; which, 
however, we did not fail, I believe, duly to apply both to 
him and ourselves. It should yet be granted, that if 
Burr possessed sensibilities of the right sort, with onehundredth part of the energies for which, with many, he 
has obtained such ill-grounded credit, his first and last 
determination, with the morning and the night, should 
be the destruction of those enemies who have so long 
and so cruelly wreaked their malicious vengeance upon 
him. But time will prove him as incapable in all his 
future efforts as he has been in the past. Honest Hennessy dined and spent the evening with me. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
Major Smith, soon after breakfast, brought me a letter 
from the office, from my wife, dated the llth ult. This 
letter, too, has announced to me, through the favor of a 
preserving Providence, the good health of my wife and 
boys, up to that date. I dare not, then, indulge a wish 
to lament the grief occasioned her hy my arrest in Lex 
ington, and the anguish that has festered in her breast 
from her reflections on the severity of my confinement in 
the Dog-days. To-day, the Chief Justice has delivered 
an able, full, and luminous opinion as ever did honor to 
a judge, which has put an end to the present prosecution. 
But I have no doubt the prosecuting counsel will show 
their ignorance and malevolence by carping at it as they 
did at the other in the treason case. The jury must to 
morrow deliver a verdict of acquittal Hay, in the mean 
time, having prayed the Court to adjourn, to give time to 
study the opinion, and thereby shape his future course. 
But in this he could not avoid showing his petulance, by 
pretending the prosecutors should exclusively be accom 
modated with the opinion, which he would not say, when 
he would return to the other side. An application, how 
ever, from Botts, to have it left with the clerk for the 
benefit of both parties, corrected this insolence, under 
which Mr. Hay sunk as usual. O'Hennessy could not 
leave town to-day until he heard the opinion, and saw 
Burr, to whom I introduced him in court. He was 
highly delighted with both, and again visited me after 
dinner, and will return to Amherst county to-morrow I 
mean as far toward it, of his 105 miles, as he can. I 
have this evening progressed further in my letter to A. 
Martin. 
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Saw Burnet, this morning, who tells me he has given 
such information to D. "Woodbridge as will probably induce him to become bail to the attachment against me at 
suit of Miller, by which I hope to procure time enough 
for Burr or Alston to settle that demand, and exonerate 
my property at Marietta from it. The prosecutors, still 
true to evil purposes and malicious designs, attempted to 
day to get rid of the prosecution against Burr by a nolle 
prosequi. This produced an argument, in which they 
were overthrown, having nothing to rely upon on their 
side but a dictum in Fosters Treatise on Homicide. The 
jury were ordered out, and after an insidious attempt, but 
which failed, with one of them to bring in a special ver 
dict, they returned into court, in half an hour, with a 
general verdict of acquittal. Hay then said he would to 
morrow enter nolle prosequis on Smith's and my indictments, and proceed with his motion to the Judge to commit and transmit us all to some other district. All are 
busy in preparing for this new contest, in which I shall 
probably personally take a part, from want of instructions in my counsel, absence of witnesses, and other rea 
sons which will appear hereafter. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

On opening the court this morning, Hay, after some 
desultory conversation on both sides of the bar, exhibited 
a general charge against us in writing, of having levied 
war against the United States, at Cumberland Island, in 
Kentucky, at Bayou Pierre, on the Mississippi, or at 
some intermediate place. We were all three, that is, 
Burr, Smith and myself, proposed to be subjected together 
to the inquiry, leaving it to the Judge to separate and 
apply to each such evidence of overt acts as the testimony 
might disclose. The Judge acquiesced in this proposition 
of Hay's, and one James McDowel was called, who 
proved nothing more at Cumberland than that Burr 
formed there a circle, and said, " he would not tell his 
secrets at that place." There are, however, a dozen 
other witnesses on the ground here who were at Cum 
berland at that time, and will swear that nothing of the 
sort took place there. Hay then attempted to examine 
as to facts in the Mississippi Territory, which called up, 
after some conversation, an argument on four points 
made by Botts ; namely, want of power in the Judge to 
transmit, under the judicial act; right of Burr to a bar 
by two acquittals here; his discharge by a grand jury 
already in Mississippi Territory ; and all his acts taken 
together constituting but one offense, for which he has 
already been tried and acquitted, within a district which 
the prosecutors have selected out of the whole for the 
purpose. Botts was very able and perspicuous in opening 
the argument, which Burr very neatly summed up and 
condensed, before the Court adjourned, about half-past 3. 
I had no opportunity that presented the least necessity 
for my rising, and think that will probably be the case 
until the motion for our recommitment is disposed of and 
defeated altogether. I was glad to find that Burr had at 
last thought of asking us to dine with him, as I was 
rather curious again to see him shine in a partie quarrie, 
consisting of new characters. We, therefore, walked 
with him from court, Luther Martin, who lives with 
him, accompanying us. We found but one other face 
that was strange to us, and a foreigner, who, I hoped, 
might turn out to he Bollman. Martin, hy the way, 
told me, " he thanked his God he should not now labor 
under the lock-jaw, which had hitherto restrained him 
before Democratic juries. He should now be no longer 
tongue-tied." Our foreigner was very taciturn and re 
served, and turned out to be a cousin of Judge Prevost's, 
and of the same name. The dinner was neat, and fol 
lowed by three or four kinds of wine splendid poverty ! 
During the chit-chat after the cloth was removed, a letter 
was handed to Burr, next to whom I sat. I immediately 
smelt musk. Burr broke the seal, put the cover to his 
nose, and then handed it to me, saying, " This amounts 
to a disclosure." I smelt the paper, and said, "indeed I 
think so." His whole physiognomy now assumed an 
alteration and vivacity that, to a stranger who had never 
seen him before, would have sunk full fifteen years of his 
age. " This," said he, " reminds me of a detection once 
very neatly practiced upon me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. One day a 
lady stepped into my library while I was reading, came 
softly behind my chair, and giving me a slap on the 
cheek, said, ' Come, tell me directly what little French 
girl, pray, have you had here ? ' The abruptness of the 
question and surprise left me little reason to doubt the 
discovery had been completely made ; so I thought it best 
to confess the whole fact, upon which the inquisitress 
burst out into a loud laugh on the success of her artifice, 
which she was led to play off upon me, from the mere 
circumstance of having smelt musk in the room." "We 
all applauded this anecdote as it deserved; but I have 
given it a place here only to convey an idea of that tem 
perament and address which enabled this character on 
certain occasions, like the snake, to cast his slough, and, 
through age and debauchery, seem to uphold his ascend 
ancy over the sex. After some time, Martin and Prevost 
withdrew, and we passed to the topics of our late adven 
tures on the Mississippi, on which Burr said little, but 
declared he did not know of any reason to blame Jack 
son, of Tennessee, for any thing he had done or omitted. 
He has not heard of J.'s letter to Claiborne, which Watkins talked so much about in the executive council at 
Orleans, on the question respecting the legislative memo 
rial to Government. Such a general may well continue 
to sacrifice to Venus, rather than to Mars; but he de 
clares he will not lose a day after the favorable issue of 
the present contest at the capitol, of which he has no 
doubt to devote his entire attention to settling up his 
projects, which have only been suspended on a better 
model ; in which work, he says, he has even here already 
made some progress. Martin presented Smith and my 
self each with his portrait, tolerably engraved, as he had 
long since promised. I intend to have it neatly framed 
by Prichard. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This morning, the Court heard a continuation of the 
arguments on both sides, which lasted until 5 o'clock this 
evening, when Randolph begged the Judge to indulge 
him with about an hour's hearing to-morrow morning, 
promising that he would show, under the Constitution 
and the spirit and genius of the laws of their country, 
that the Court could not comply with Hay's present 
motion, to have us again committed and transmitted to 
another district. Of the success of such an attempt I can 
see no prospect, even if the Judge should be of opinion, 
contrary to what has been so ably contended by Burr's 
counsel, that the Court has a power to commit under the 
judicial act; as a total failure of evidence to prove any 
overt act upon us must undermine the motion. I spent 
the evening at the Harmonic Society, where I took a part 
in a symphony and a quartette by Pleyel, but with less 
effect than if I had been provided with my own specta 
cles. I had the pleasure of meeting there Neville, Spence 
and other visitors ; besides hearing several good glees, in 
some of which a Miss Coniers took the upper part. She 
is a very pretty girl, and is said by Neville to be accom 
plished. The society broke up, however, early the music 
not producing the best effect, from the state of the 
weather, and the room being too much crowded. I found 
an old letter in the Post-office, announcing protest of the 
bill held some time since by Luckett, with my indorsement for $2,500, so that every thing that little shop 
keeper had told me of no proceedings having ever been 
taken against me, as an indorser, was utterly false. I 
was called upon this evening by David Meade, who 
seriously assured me that vicious partisan, Scot, the Mar 
shal, had been trying to make a bargain with him to 
undertake the office of a Deputy, for the purpose of reconducting us to Kentucky, anticipating the success of 
the present motion, though Hay has certainly said out c f 
court, this evening, he does not expect he shall succee 1. 
Such are the tricks of these jugglers, in and out of 
court. Midnight. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Randolph kept his promise this morning, so far as 
making out his hour, but did little more service, having 
offered nothing new, except one argument to show that 
where a man had been charged for the same murder in 
different States, the law arising upon his acquittal in the 
first was different from what it would be on an acquittal 
of an overt act of the same treason in the first district, 
where the offender was tried. Then the Judge delivered 
his opinion, condensing the four points made by Botts 
within the observations he made on two of them ; 
namely, power of the Court under the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, to arrest and transmit to a 
Territory, which he decided in the negative ; and the 
effect of Burr's acquittal, which, he hoped, it would not 
be necessary for him to decide upon, as he should prefer 
a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
It followed, as he laid it down from this adjudication, that 
the prosecutors might adduce any evidence in their power 
to prove any overt acts against us, Burr included, com 
mitted any where in the United States, to authorize him 
to transmit us to any district thereof. But, does it not 
thence follow, that a persecuting and vindictive Government may order its attorney to harrass an obnoxious, but 
innocent, victim of its wrath, by playing off the farce of 
a prosecution against him, in a district of its own selection, without effect, and afterward ruin him, by dragging 
him through every other district in the Union ? "What 
better answer can be given to this supposition tban saying such a case is rendered improbable, by supposing no 
government will be wicked enougb to contrive such a 
villainy ? But this is begging the question. I have here 
put a case, which has not been supposed at the bar ; but, 
with very little alteration, it is our own case. How long 
is it since the prosecutors began to digest all the infor 
mation it collected by the most illicit means, from the 
most foul sources, not of our acts, but of our designs, 
before we committed any acts? Did they not order 
prosecutions fifteen hundred miles from the present ? Did 
they not make two selections of their ground, besides an 
attempt at a third, by Graham, their agent, or at his in 
stance as a spy and informer, in the State of Ohio, which 
was only avoided by my flight, and after having failed in 
all of proof, do they not now seek to drag us back again 
to the same district where they have already miscarried 
and failed in every thing, but the success of the plunder 
and outrage committed on my family and property, by 
informers and personal enemies the dregs of all the 
human society in my absence, when I had incurred no 
forfeiture ? 

The Judge having further declared the prosecutors 
might now proceed with their evidence, they called up 
James McDowel, who swore to some unimportant statements, which, if necessary, we can disprove by a dozen 
witnesses. But they attempted repeatedly to go into 
evidence, not only of alleged facts, but even of declarations of third persons, to prove overt acts and designs 
within the United States ; and the Judge, for reasons I 
can not imagine, seemed disposed to countenance the proceeding, which is certainly in direct hostility with his 
own opinion this day delivered ; unless as a committing 
magistrate, he thinks he ought to indulge a greater latitude of investigation than he would permit on a trial. 
But to-morrow's proceedings will further elucidate these 
matters. 10 o'clock, P. M. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Strickland called upon me before the sitting of the 
Court this morning, to say he should in two hours set off 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. I wrote a short letter to Harding, to give 
him some account of my situation, and tell him I hoped 
the present demands of the Government on our persons 
would he satisfied on Monday ; after which, I hoped to 
be at Marietta in fifteen or sixteen days, whence I should 
proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> as speedily as my affairs would per 
mit. But I since regret to find, from the complexion 
of affairs in court to-day, that our detention may yet ex 
tend even to a month, unless our counsel shall succeed, in 
efforts they will not cease to make, to confine the prose 
cutors within the limits of the established rules of evi 
dence, and the adjudications already pronounced by the 
Court ; for this whole day was spent in arguments and 
altercations in violation of both. This was chiefly occa 
sioned by the prosecutors persisting in the conduct they 
pursued yesterday, which produced a corresponding op 
position, which I lamented to see the Judge not only 
permit, but in some degree participate in ; for instance, 
Dunbaugh was allowed to-day to testify to facts at and 
below Bayou Pierre, while two or three witnesses yesterday were always stopped, with the concurrence of 
the Court, as often as they attempted to speak of any 
thing without the lines of the United States. How this 
is reconcilable with the opinion of the Court, I have yet 
to learn. Altercations on points already settled, or on a 
series of topics, where the contest is a logomachy, have 
always a narcotic influence on me. Nor could any sense 
of the interest I had in the consequences, or any stimulus 
the ingenuity of Wickham or Botts could apply to all 
the intensity of my admiration of their talents, prevent 
my passing the day in a sort of doze ? Burr, I observed, 
seemed so irritated with the Judge's apparent incon 
sistency with himself, that he would not trust himself 
to rise to sum up and condense the forces displayed by 
his counsel, into compact columns, after the engagement, 
toward the close of the day, as is generally his practice. 
He has no fear of the final result, but feels what a 
mortifying check he has received. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I proposed this morning to devote the entire day to 
writing, my attendance in court through the week totally 
preventing almost the whole of the labor demanded of 
my pen. But a solicitude to confer separately with Burr 
and Mercer, on the course indulged to the prosecutors by 
the Court the last two days, forced me to go in quest of 
those so oppositely interesting characters : and the debts 
yet unpaid, that laid so heavy a burden on my reflections, 
which I wanted to discharge to Mrs. Gamble, Mrs. Chev 
alier and Col. de Pestre, who had long been confined with 
the influenza, hurried me out of doors immediately after 
breakfast. I found Burr, just after a consultation with 
his counsel, secretly writhing under much irritation at 
the conduct of the Judge, but affecting an air of contempt 
for his alleged inconsistency, as he asserted His Honor did 
not for two days understand either the questions or him 
self; had wavered in his opinions "before yesterday's ad 
journment, and should in future be put right by strong 
language, I am afraid to say abuse, though I think I 
could swear he used that word, on the part of the de 
fense. I observed, that though I believed the Judge's 
the purest of all human hearts, I could not, in my best 
judgment, reconcile the latitude he permitted the prose 
cutors, either with the letter or spirit of his last opinion 
delivered on Friday. Burr replied nothing to my offer 
of tribute to the Judge's heart, but said his Burr's 
opinion should draw him back from his deviations from 
it, and he would hang him, not so facetiously, indeed, as 
Eaton swore he would hang Miranda, but upon every 
comma of his opinion. He then inquired where Mercer 
was, and expressed a strong desire to know his thoughts 
on the Judge's late conduct. I answered, "that I had 
come out chiefly to gratify the same desire, and should 
go directly to seek Mercer." I left Smith with him, and 
took leave. I bent my way to Mr. Chevalier's, to see De 
Pestre, whom I found at home. Mrs. Chevalier received 
me very kindly, and prevailed on her husband, who was 
confined to his room, to come down stairs to see me, and 
beg of me to partake of a family dinner with them, 
which I accepted. After an hour's conversation, I then 
made a visit to Mrs. Gamble, who seems a most amiable 
old lady, and so fraught with the generous humanity 
characteristic of her sex, as to suffer not the connections 
of her daughters, Mrs. Cabell, the Governor's wife, and 
Mrs. Wirt, to prevent her expressing not merely a con 
cern for the general hardships we have suffered, but even 
to censure the last two days' proceedings in court. I was 
not fortunate enough to find Mercer before I returned to 
Chevalier's to dinner, where I spent a pleasant evening, 
save so far as Mr. Chevalier was not of our company, 
being confined to his bed. Mrs. C. is as lively and agree 
able as it is possible for any woman to be with limited 
endowments and without beauty. I had an hour's inter 
esting conversation by means of a walk before tea with 
De Pestre in the garden, which, however, touched on no 
new matters, except his informing me that Mrs. Alston 
had expressed to him a wish that he would engage in 
nothing before next spring that might prevent her father 
from having an opportunity of forming another connection with him, conveying an intimation which he avoided 
as delicately as he could. We again harmonized in reprobation of Alston, in every point of view, when I hinted to 
the Colonel some expectations and reasons I entertained 
for urging Burr or Alston to give me an obligation, if 
they can't raise money, for the amount of my losses by 
them, yet unsatisfied, which he approved of. He will 
spend some time with me to-morrow evening, when we 
will prosecute our thoughts. 

I visited Mr. C. in his bedroom, after tea, for awhile, 
and on my return home, I learned from Smith, a confirmation of what De Pestre had already mentioned to me, that 
Burr sets off immediately for England, after his liberation from the present motion before the Court, to collect 
money for reorganizing his projects, which I now r have 
ascertained to be as baseless as the interests of the parties 
or persons to whom he discloses them are opposed or 
variant. For he assures his creditors here at least he 
has done so to Smith that when he raises money in 
England, he will not be strict in questioning demands 
upon him in this country, which he will fully discharge. 
In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, no doubt, he will pledge himself to appropri 
ate every guinea they will advance him to the promotion 
of such operations on this continent as will best serve the 
interests of Britain; and if he had not already exposed 
his duplicity and incapacity in his favorite art of intrigue 
to Yrujo, he would again as readily promise to advance, 
with Spanish dollars and Spanish arms, the fortunes of 
the Spanish minister and his master. But is it not a 
little strange that he should have never dropped even a 
hint to me of his projected trip to England. I have had 
more of his confidence than either Smith or De Pestre ; 
for he has insinuated to me that the former was not dis 
posed to fight on the Mississippi, when I thought he had 
the disposition not to do so himself; and he has, during 
our embarrassments on that river, through Wilkinson, 
spoken, in the presence of Major Smith, myself, and 
others, of the probability of De Pestre's being hanged, 
through failure of an enterprise he had sent him on, as 
an event which he treated with the utmost indifference. 
Surely I may repeat, that whatever feeling this man pos 
sesses, is confined within the sensuality of his temperament ; if indeed his conduct, in the eyes of all who really 
know him, does not warrant the suspicion of Cowles 
Meade, and fully prove, while the whole bar as little 
knew him as Col. Swartwout, whose attachment is still 
unshaken, that there is at best but method in his madness. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Dunbaugh was reproduced to-day, with no other effect 
than to contradict himself, by saying Burr communicated 
to him in secret his having been betrayed by Wilkinson, 
though he swore, on Saturday, Burr imparted to him no 
secrets. The Judge has noted enough in this witness to 
destroy all credit in his testimony. The day passed in 
the examination of other witnesses called by prosecutors, 
whose evidence was altogether favorable to us, though I 
was mortified to see the Judge, considering himself as an 
examining magistrate, open so wide the door to the wan 
ton discretion of the prosecutors, as to allow them to offer 
testimony of any sort, which they alleged to be explan 
atory of the so-called overt acts on Cumberland Island, at 
which place, it is confessed, the assemblage, at most, was 
doubtful or equivocal in its character. I can not com 
prehend the distinction taken by the Court between ad 
missible and operative evidence; nor do any of the bar 
here, I believe, perceive how evidence that can not oper 
ate upon the subject be admissible. It seems to me, that 
perhaps the Judge has at last thought it necessary to sac 
rifice a little to public prejudice, when the concession can 
not cause any serious consequences in the issue of this 
strange contest. This evening De Pestre spent an hour 
with me, which was passed in a more dilated view of his 
past concerns with Burr. He gave me a description of 
the manners and character of Yrujo, who is reconfirmed 
in his embassy to this country, in spite of all the efforts 
of this Government for his removal. This minister is, 



BURR'S MANAGEMENT. 417 

according to De Pestre's portrait of him, a shrewd politi 
cian, who pierced the cohweb tissues of Burr's intrigues 
with him at a single glance. Though he assured De 
Pestre, who was charged in Kentucky, last October, with 
a special mission to him, that had Burr opened his designs 
with frankness, and really projected a severance of the 
Union, and nothing hostile to the Spanish provinces, he, 
Burr, might have had an easy resort to the Spanish treas 
ury and its arsenals, while his confidence would have been 
safely lodged in the honor of a Spanish nobleman. But 
Yrujo laughed at the awkwardness with which Burr en 
deavored to mask his designs on Mexico, and expressed 
his concern for De Pestre's having lost his time in such a 
service. But Burr, if he had capacity or money for re 
animating his projects, has lost a season never to be 
recalled. He might, last winter, have had the whole 
equipage of two French ships of war, who offered to 
bring their small arms with them into his services. If 
he had not talents, or spirits to use them, he is where 
he should "bje. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

A variety of witnesses, examined to-day by the prosecu 
tors, seem to me to advance their cause but little, though 
their newspapers pretend they throw great light on the 
mysterious proceedings of Burr. But his mysteriousness 
is surely an impenetrable shield to cover his treasonable 
designs, if he had any. I have seen a complete file of all 
the depositions made before the grand jury in Burr's pos 
session. It must be confessed tbat few other men in his 

circumstances could have procured these documents out

THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 



of the custody of offices filled by his inveterate enemies. 
I have long been at a loss to imagine the means he used, 
of which I am not yet fully informed. But I have learned 
accidentally that Skelton Jones has become friendly to 
him. This Jones, a noted duelist, the brother of the late 
Reviewer, and he who formerly conducted the Examiner, 
an influential Democrat, I am told, received a letter some 
time since from Burr, covering a bank-note, without 
specifying for what purpose the money was sent. Jones 
returned it, with civil remonstrance, which gave Burr an 
opportunity of requesting an interview, which, if it did 
not succeed in removing the easy scruples of this honor 
able patriot, has, however, since that event, completely 
attached Mr. J.'s interest, as I have learned from a Mr. 
Braxton, a young lawyer here of some talents. Burr has 
again asserted to-day, in court, that he expects, by the 
mail, documents to enable him to show that Eaton must 
be an incompetent witness in any court. This, if estab 
lished, will give the coup de grace to the fame of the Dernean hero, who, I am assured by Robison, has sworn the 
peace against a Mr. Smith, of Petersburgh, who threat 
ened to kick this General out of the room; and yet he 
appears every day in court, affecting by his looks an air of 
defiance. Wilkinson also exhibits his boasted arrogance, 
sometimes in the same place. But his examination can 
not come on for some days. When it takes place, it must 
be of the highest interest in the eyes of those who, knowing his character and the insidiously artful deposition he 
has made before the grand jury, will contemplate a spec 
tacle of depravity seldom equaled ; while such a sum 
mons to the address, I will not yet add the firmness of 
Burr, will leave no nerve untouched. But /may venture 
to predict that Burr will sink under it. For, apart from 
the merits or demerits of either, there are reasons why it 
should be so in this country, if not in any other upon 
earth, which I will unfold at large hereafter. I find by D. 
Woodbridge, many people have died at Marietta, within 
two months past, of a malignant disease prevailing there. 
Did God's mercy place us elsewhere ? Midnight. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

It chiefly engaged my attention in court to-day to hear 
Burr contend, that conversations by me with others, 
respecting him while he was absent, and prior to the 
period of any alleged acts, should not affect him. This 
attempt was made to obviate the effect he apprehended 
from the testimony of the Hendersons ; but the Judge was 
pleased to overrule it. Woodbridge has expressed some 
wish to be discharged, and return with Belknap to Mari 
etta, but assures me he will still wait until the whole 
affair is finished, or while he can be of any service to me. 
I have begged he may not, observing, his being my bail 
need not detain him ; and have told him, at the same 
time, to take no trouble on my account, etc. He seems 
satisfied, as I have informed him of the fact of General 
Dayton having gone to Ohio, though not discharged from 
his recognizance. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This morning I was treated to the narrative of Sandy 
Henderson, which is considered to bear more particularly 
on me than any other testimony. I had projected a long 
cross-examination of him, which I should have pursued 
with good effect, but our counsel feared it might operate 
quite contrary to my expectations from the uniform experience they have, that within these virtuous States, 
when once witnesses determine to swear for a purpose, 
all attempts to involve them in inconsistency only tend 
to render them more desperate. I therefore agreed to 
postpone my cross-examination until the next day, that I 
might, in the meaii time, confer with Mr. Wickham on 
the subject, as he feared, I suppose, that something might 
break out injurious to Burr, through my pressing Hender 
son ; and Mr. Botts, from his' connection with that family, 
wished to be excused from taking any part in this exam 
ination. I had here another check, from the obligations 
Mr. Botts has already imposed upon me. But I assured 
him I had discovered his connection too late to prevent 
his having been concerned for me. It was yesterday I 
should have mentioned as having seen Henderson first 
called, and in consequence of the difficulties affecting 
Wickham on account of Burr, and myself on account of 
Botts, I last night drew up a series of interrogatories, 
which I wished Henderson to answer upon affidavit by 
consent, with which I called upon Wickham in the even 
ing. He also conferred with Burr upon them ; all ap 
proved of the questions, but still feared the effect of them, 
from the apprehended hostility of the witness; so that 
we concluded on one only of them, which we put to him 
this morning in court: namely, "whether, at the time of 
my alleged communications to him, he did not, and doth 
not yet, entertain a strong prejudice against Col. Burr?" 
which he answered in the affirmative. I met this evening with an introduction, at the Harmonic Society, to a 
very handsome woman, a Mrs. Meyio, who has been too 
many years a widow, though I hear she is soon to be 
married. I mention her as being the niece of the amiable and highly esteemed Mrs. Carrington, whom I have 
not yet visited to thank her for her generous offer, more 
than once made through Mercer, to send me refreshments to the Penitentiary. I took a part in a quartette 
of Haydn's, and in a glee, and returned home after mid 
night. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Yesterday, John Henderson gave his testimony to the 
same effect Sandy had done, and underwent little or no 
examination. John Graham also delivered his to the 
same purport with that he gave against me, before Toulmin and Rodney. But, in cross-examining him, I asked 
him to say " who was to pay the $1,000 for forfeiting his 
recognizance to appear to prosecute me in the Mississippi 
Territory:" he applied to the Court to be excused answering this question ; denied he had applied to Col. Scott to 
invite A. Burr to his house to dinner to have him kid 
napped, and said, he has got his present office of chief 
clerk in the Secretary of State's office, lately. To-day, 
after consultation with our counsel, I agree to waive ob 
jections I had offered against reading the "Querist" in 
print, or Henderson's evidence of my having shown him 
only a manuscript of a composition by me with such 
signature. The reading of the fourth number by the 
prosecutors, with examination of Dana and Gilmore, 
finished the day.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

To-day, the long-expected examination of Wilkinson 
came on, after that of Eaton, upon matter and conversations between him and Burr, which had been excluded as 
improper evidence on the trial-in-chief, but was now 
thought admissible before the Judge as an examining 
magistrate. I have taken, I believe, faithful notes of 
every thing that fell from both of these persons, by which 
it will appear that Eaton's testimony is indefinite as to 
any bearing that it should have upon Burr's designs, 
without seeking for those inconsistencies with his former 
story before the grand jury, and on the trial-in-chief, 
which Martin, under the signature of " Investigator," is 
endeavoring to establish in the Virginia Gazette here. 
The General exhibited the manner of a serjeant under a 
court-martial, rather than the demeanor of an accusing 
officer confronted with his culprit. His perplexity and 
derangement, even upon his direct examination, has 
placed beyond all doubt " his honor as a soldier, and his 
fidelity as a citizen." It will appear from the gauntlet 
he has begun to run, which he will not finish before 
Monday evening, that he has confessed he altered a du 
plicate of the original cipher letter for the express purpose 
of erasing from it an acknowledgment by Burr, of 
Burr's having received a letter from him, Wilkinson, of 
the 27th of February ; that this was done for the avowed 
purpose of concealing from the Legislature of Orleans a 
part of that letter, from which that body might infer that 
he was privy to, or concerned in, the projects of Burr; 
that he substituted other words in ' the room of the 
erasure as a translation of the erased ciphers afterward,' 
but at what time he could not recollect ; that the translation of the document sent to Government was from this 
mutilated original ; and that he had sworn, by an affidavit 
he produced himself in court, that such translation faith 
fully rendered the substance of the original. On the 
other hand, Burr, who was very unwell, preserved a com 
posure, inspired by Wilkinson's self-condemnation, and 
supported by his indisposition, contrary to the expectations I had formed a few days past. The cross-examination progressed but a little way, and was adjourned until 
Monday. Yesterday evening, Woodbridge called upon 
me in the most abrupt manner, to repeat to me what he 
had before observed on Wednesday evening, that he was 
very desirous to return home, and hoped I would that 
evening look out for other bail. But he hardly allowed 
me time to answer, " that I would, and whether I succeeded or not, I wished him not to stay a moment on my 
account," before he had the unfeeling ingratitude to add, 
" that if I did not, he should give me up in the morning." 
I was accordingly prepared on the opening of the court 
this morning, to state to the Judge, " that Mr. Woodbridge was about to be discharged ; but previous to his 
leaving town he wished also to be discharged from the 
recognizance he had entered into on my account, for 
reasons I did not inquire into; that it thence became 
necessary I should find other securities, or be recommitted, 
of which I should prefer the latter, rather than solicit 
bail in a place where I was almost an utter stranger. 
But I believe two citizens of this place were voluntarily 
attending, for the purpose of entering with me into 
another recognizance. John Banks and a Mr. A 

then were called forward, and thus ended, I wish I could 
say my last concern, with the Woodbridge family. Of 
Dudley, it must not he concealed, that although he is 
reputed to have given a fair, candid, and to us advan 
tageous testimony, he has not yet told the whole truthhaving suppressed my communication to him of our 
designs being unequivocally against Mexico, which I 
suppose he kept back, because he embraced and em 
barked in the plan on the first mention of it to him, 
though he afterward receded from it, upon his own re 
flections or the counsels of others.* 

SUNDAY, DECEMBER 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

While at breakfast, this morning, I received a verbal 
message from Burr, importing that he wanted to see me. 
On my arrival soon after at his house, I found him in 
bed. He informed me he wanted to see me, to know 
what I would advise him to do in his complaint, observ 
ing, he had no confidence in the physicians here. I sug 
gested to him my being of the same opinion, unless I 
excepted McClung, whom I believed to be a man of some 
genius, and probably possessing considerable skill in his 
profession. Burr said he was a creature of rule; and 
calling again for my opinion, I said I would have some 
pills made up for him, which he could take for two or 
three nights. I left him to go to the druggist's, where I 
had the medicine carefully prepared, which I sent him 



* The integrity and respectability of Mr. Woodbridge is undoubted by all who knew him. 
From a personal acquaintance for some years previous to his death, I am enabled to add, that 
euch was the purity of his character, through a long and useful career, as to stamp with uniruthfulness any reflection upon his honor as a man or his veracity as a witness. 
about two o'clock, accompanied with a note conveying 
directions for his diet, and the use of the medicine. I 
called there again in the evening to see him ; hut while I 
was engaged in the parlor with several persons, where 
Martin was reading to us a heavy manuscript of his next 
Investigator, I found on going into Burr's bedroom, soon 
after Martin had done, that he had just taken, instead of 
my medicine, a dose of laudanum. He said he felt so 
weak, and was in such want of rest, he thought it best to 
take an opiate. I told him he must then omit my pills 
for this night, wished him good rest, and took leave. 
On my return to the parlor, Baker told me a Mr. Smith, 
who knew my family in Ireland, and might probably 
recognize me, solicited him to bring us together. "He 
should accordingly bring Mr. Smith, with my leave, to 
my lodgings." I assented, and thanked him. He also 
acquainted me that Mrs. Broughenbrough, commonly 
called Brokenberry here, who is regarded as the nearest 
approximation in this town to a savante and bel-esprit, has 
expressed no small solicitude, and has insisted that Hay 
will enable her to read the " Querist," which is much 
praised here. Martin boasts of the fourth number, not a 
little, as a piece of argumentation which the prosecutors 
had better conceal from the public, while they wish to 
keep them uninformed on the merits of the question respecting a severance of the Union. Martin has also 
assured me Judge Tucker, though a violent Democrat, 
seriously contended at a party, with Judge Marshall, in 
this town since May last, that any State in the Union is 
at any time competent to recede from the same, though 
Marshall strongly opposed this doctrine. I find Robinson, the only correct stenographer, who takes exact notes 
of all the proceedings at the capitol, and is besides a 
scholar, who understands five or six languages, will give 
the " Querist " a longer life by incorporating it in his book 
than it was likely to enjoy in the barren soil of the " Ohio 
Gazette," where it appeared to bloom but as an humble 
flower, and trampled under the feet of the sovereign peo 
ple. Baker is a young lawyer, whom Burr employs, 
more for the benefit of his influence out of doors than 
from the aid of talents or services in court, where he is 
only of use through his humor and the freedom with 
which he lavishes his abuse. I believe he possesses as 
good a heart as is permitted to a Democrat, and his 
spirits and popularity are perhaps, in effect, as valuable 
to Burr as the talents of "Wickham or Botts. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I had, this morning, a long double letter from my 
adored wife. Its red seal was as welcome to my eyes 
as the evening star to the mariner after the agitation of 
a storm. For I had, last week, suffered no small anxiety 
from the want of a letter. But the seal, notwithstanding 
its color, and every curve and turn of the letters in the 
superscription, had long passed under jealous inspection, 
to undergo every scrutiny from which I could augur the 
import of the intelligence within, before I would venture 
to break it open. But I was assured by the seal there 
was no mortality, at least on the -5th ult., as by the post 
mark. I trust, then, the heartfelt offerings of thanksgiving I tried to breathe forth to Heaven were borne to 
Almighty God, before I consulted the contents of the 
letter. There I soon saw how industriously my beloved 
continued to practice the only fraud her pure soul is capable of conceiving that of endeavoring to hide from me 
all she feels for me, and has suffered for our dear boys. 
Her complaint in her chest is mentioned in a way to alarm 
me, through the vail of disguise she has attempted to 
throw over it. But the weekly reports she will not fail 
to see of the criminal proceedings here, will, I trust, 
lighten much of the anxiety she labors under, which, I 
know, so much aggravates the affection in her breast. I 
next find my boys have, both of them, had fevers ; and 
my dear Harman, who has suffered most, was perhaps at 
the height of his disease, about the period when I last 
dreamed I had lost him, and has perhaps been spared to 
us, through the merits of his incomparable mother, which 
have not been beheld with the less favor of Providence, 
while I was offering up my prayers, in the Penitentiary, 
for his preservation. I have, I find, in concluding my 
notes of the 2d inst., observed, I again dreamt I had lost 
my Harman. Did my first dream of his irrecoverable 
injury from a dog typify the disease of which he was to 
suffer ? and did my second dream, which was visited upon 
me in the Penitentiary, a night or two before I noted it on 
the 2d inst., come upon me as another vision to announce, 
perhaps, a relapse he has undergone, since his mother's 
letter of the 25th ult. was written. These things are 
only known to the Eternal and All-wise Dispenser of 
our mortality. But while reason shall continue my only 
guide to faith, I will yet wonder in mysterious awe of 
such dreams as these, which my understanding can not 
scan, while they appal my heart. If I shall be blessed 
with the sight of another red seal riext Monday, I shall 
put off a heavy burden of anxiety which now oppresses 
me. The Court does not sit to-day, on account of Burr's 
illness. I find he is much worse than yesterday. He says 
he will take my medicine to-night, and has rejected bleed 
ing, proposed to him by McClung, in which I fully agreed 
with him that he should not part with his blood, even at 
a Joe a drop. I called upon De Pestre, this morning, at 
Mr. Chevalier's, where Mr. C. kindly pressed me to dine 
en famille, which I declined, through a desire to write at 
home and attend a private quartette-party at the Har 
monic Society's room this evening. The invitation of 
Chevalier was given in the most friendly manner, with a 
reprobation of the restriction imposed on the hospitable 
dispositions of the families of this town by the effects of 
a system of espionage, which is kept up by Government 
and its agents to a degree that has generally prevented 
those attentions we should otherwise receive. This must 
be the case, as I have not received a visit from any familyman, much less an invitation, since my release from im 
prisonment, though Mr. Pickett, who lives in the first 
style here, informed my landlord, Walton, the other day, 
he means to invite me to his house. So that etiquette 
seems also to be totally disregarded ; and, no doubt, here, 
as in other countries, a want of better breeding is received 
by strangers as a proof of inhospitality not merited. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Jurr took my medicine last night as he promised, 
rested well, and is much better this morning. But he 
has prudently declined attending court, though he is evidently mortified, he is not able to witness the progress of 
his recrimination of Wilkinson, conducted by his counsel, 
in which he is so desirous to take a part, especially as 
Botts has retired to Fredericksburg, to attend to other 
professional calls upon him. I perused this morning, at 
Burr's, some interesting documents, forwarded to him 
from New Orleans by Ed. Livingston and Alexander, all 
tending to overtake Wilkinson with a portion of that re 
tributive justice he has so fairly earned. Of these papers, 
I trust the Chief Justice, in the spirit of that latitude he 
has so liberally permitted to the prosecutors, will, as an 
examining magistrate, allow the affidavits of Derbigeny 
and Mercier to be read, as both go to prove the Bri 
gadier's corruption in having received from Carondelet, 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>, a douceur of $9,000 at Cincinnati, which, added 
to every thing else that will appear against him, should 
surely settle his integrity and credit, if not his admissibility as a witness.* On opening of the court, Graham 



* John Mercier, jun., of the city of New Orleans, being duly sworn, 
maketh oath, that he was one of the clerks in the office of the Governor 
in the time of the Spanish dominion, during a period of nine years, from 
the year 1792 to the year 1801. That while this deponent was employed 
in the said office, to-wit, in the years 1795 and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>, a secret correspondence was carried on in cipher between the said Governor, then the Baron 
de Carondelet, and some person of note, who then was in the western part 
of the United States, and, as this deponent believes, on the waters of the 
Ohio. That this deponent had no certain knowledge of the name of the 
said person, but that it was a matter of notoriety, among those who were 
employed in the said office, that the said person was General Wilkinson. 
That this deponent was intrusted with the care or charge of deciphering 
some of the letters which were received from the said person, and of copying some of the answers which were made to them by the Governor. That 
the cipher was understood by means of a small English dictionary ; and 
that so far as this deponent now recollects, the number of the page and 
the line where the word wras in the dictionary was made use of, instead

voluntarily came forward to explain a part of his testi 
mony, and, I know not why, was pleased to declare I had 
told him at Marietta, "that both Burr and myself perceived the people were not ripe for a severance of the 
Union; that we should not hurry it, as it would take 
place from natural causes of itself, and we had no per
of the word itself. That this deponent very well recollects that the project 
treated of in the said correspondence was the dismembering of the Western States and Territories from the Union, but that he is not able to recollect the particulars. And this deponent further swears, that some time 
toward the end of the year 1795, Mr. Thomas Power, who was employed 
as the confidential agent of the Spanish Government for this secret nego 
tiation, was intrusted with a sum of nine thousand dollars, or thereabouts, 
destined for the said person, which sum was delivered to the said Power, 
in the office of the Governor, in the presence of this deponent. That the 
said Power set off with it, and, as this deponent believes, with the dis 
patches which were prepared on that occasion for the said person.

BONAMF, Justice of the Peace. 

John McPonaugh, jun., being duly sworn, doth depose, that some time 
in the month of March, in the year 1804, General Wilkinson consulted with 
this deponent, as a commission merchant, on the probability of sugar or 
cotton shipped from this country to the Atlantic ports turning to advan 
tage. The advice of this deponent was, to ship sugars in preference; upon 
which the General requested this deponent to purchase for him sugars to 
the amount of nine or ten thousand dollars, payable in cash. This deponent, accoi'dingly, purchased for the General, through Messrs. Dusan and 
Dubourg, brokers, one hundred and seven hogsheads of sugar, and chartered the ship Louisiana, in which the General took his passage, to transport 
it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, the said sugar being shipped on the sole risk and account 
of the General. That the amount of the said sugar, as invoiced, was eight 
thousand and forty-five dollars and thirty-five cents ; and this deponent 
gave the General a bill of exchange on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> for one thousand dollars, 
the sugars not amounting to the sums which the General risked to be in 
vested in them. That the amount of the said two sums, being $9,045 35, 
was paid to this deponent by the General, in Mexican dollars, and that 
some of the bags containing the said money were Mexican bags, such as 
come from Vera Cruz ; and this deponent recollects that the said purchase 
excited at the time much speculation among the American inhabitants ofsonal interest in the event." Then came on the little 
Brigadier, whose demeanor, to-day, was no doubt as op 
posite to that arrogance in which he strutted at Orleans, 
during the reign of his brief authority, as was the car 
riage of Dionysius at Corinth, compared with his royal 
port before at Syracuse. But I should not have degraded 

New Orleans, as to the resources of the General which enabled him to pay 
so large a sum of money in cash; and the Governor himself, some time 
after the departure of the General, spoke to this deponent upon the subject, 
appearing to be desirous of ascertaining the amount of the sugars which 
had been purchased, and the means by which the General had been enabled 
to pay for them. JOHN McDoNAUGH, JUN.

JOHN LYND, Justice of the Peace. 

Peter Derbigeny, of New Orleans, Counselor-at-Law, being sworn on 
the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, deposeth, that some time in the year 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>, this deponent being then a resident at New Madrid, on the Missis 
sippi, Mr. Thomas Power, then employed by the Spanish Government on a 
private agency, went up the Ohio as far as Cincinnati, as this deponent 
was told, and returned some time afterward to New Madrid, in quest of a 
sum of money, which was delivered to him by Dr. Thomas Portall, the then 
commandant of that post. That this deponent was informed by a Spanish 
officer, on whose veracity he had every reason to depend, that the said 
money was destined for General Wilkinson, who was in secret correspondence with the Spanish Government. That Mr. Thomas Power, in order to 
conceal the said money, which was, as far as this deponent can recollect, 
a sum of nine thousand dollars, or thereabouts, bought from this deponent 
some barrels of sugar and coffee, in the center of which the said money 
was packed up in small bags which were made for that purpose in this 
deponent's family. That after these preparations were gone through, Mr. 
T. Power set off on his way back to Cincinnati; and that, on said Power's 
return from thence, this deponent was told that the said money had arrived 
safe, and had been delivered to General Wilkinson. And this deponent 
further saith, that shortly after the surrender of Louisiana to the United 
States, a rumor having circulated that General Wilkinson had shipped in 
the vessel in which he returned to the Atlantic States a large quantity of 
sugar, the price of which he had paid him in dollars lately coined, contained in bags not yet unsewed, and such as they are when sent from the 
Spanish mint, this deponent grew suspicious that it was again money paid 
by the Spanish treasury to General Wilkinson, and felt it his duty toward 
the fortunes of that tyrant by a com<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>on with this 
urchin. I continue to take notes of his testimony to his 
own turpitude, which I shall not transcribe here, as they 
may be seen among my papers, by my friends. But it is 
here I shotfld observe, that the address of Wickham, in 
conducting the cross-examination to-day, was masterly 
and ingenious, not only in regard to the witness, but to 
the Administration which so embarrassed Hay, as well as 
the General, that it would be impossible to say which of 
them most heartily welcomed a sudden adjournment, in 



the Government, to whom he had of late sworn allegiance, to inform the 
Governor of this province of the facts to him known concerning the money 
sent up to General Wilkinson in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1796">1796</a>; that Governor Claiborne then re 
quested this deponent to write to the President of the United States on the 
subject; that this deponent wrote accordingly to the President of the 
United States, and delivered his letter into the hands of Gov. Claiborne, 
after having shown him the contents, which he approved of; and that, as 
the said letter was not signed, this deponent, by the advice of Gov. Clai 
borne, mentioned therein to the President that he might know the name 
of the writer from Gov. Claiborne himself, if he should wish it. 

And this deponent further swears, that in the winter of 1804 to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>, 
this deponent being then at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>, in the capacity of a deputy 
from the inhabitants of Louisiana to Congress, jointly with Messrs. Dostrehan and Sawis, he was introduced to Col. Burr, then Vice-President of 
the United States, by General Wilkinson, who strongly recommended to 
this deponent, and, as he believes, to his colleagues, to cultivate the acquaintance of Col. Burr, whom he used to call " the first gentleman in 
America;" telling them that he was a man of the most eminent talents, 
both as a politician and as a military character ; and this deponent further 
swears, that General Wilkinson told him, several times, that Col. Burr, so 
soon as his Vice-Presidency would be at an end, would go to Louisiana, 
where he had certain projects ; adding, that he was such a man as to succeed in any thing he would undertake, and inviting this deponent to give 
him all the information in his power respecting that country ; which mys 
terious hints appeared to this deponent very extraordinary, though he 
could not then understand them. P. DERBIGENY.

SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS. 433 

wliich Hay hastily sought the only retreat that was left 
to his confusion. The Judge had hardly risen from the 
bench, when a general buzz about Wilkinson's embarrassment ran through the crowd, and in five minutes every 
Democrat in the capitol was expressing his surprise at 
the effect with which we had so suddenly changed our 
characters and turned accusers. I sat this evening an 
hour with Burr. Bollman and Major Smith were the 
only other persons of the party. Here was an opportunity to confirm my conviction, that neither Burr nor 
Bollman desired I should have any acquaintance with 
the latter, for neither solicited nor proposed an introduction. Both, no doubt, have discovered, long since, I am 
not of a temper to further their intrigues, but they are 
short-sighted in not perceiving how effectually I can and 
will assuredly frustrate them. Well ! we chatted, never 
theless, on the exclusive topics of our present concerns 
with the Government, among which, it was observed by 
Burr, " that he should not be surprised if the next ^In 
quirer ' attributed his absence from court, at this time, to 
fear of confronting Wilkinson." I remarked, " that such 
misrepresentation could have no effect, as the " Virginia 
Gazette " would contradict it. Burr said, " this last 
paper had no circulation ; " and if $300 could be raised 
immediately, the press of the " Impartial Observer," 
which has been obliged to stop for want of funds, could 
be again set to work. The editor was bold and ingeni 
ous, passed for " a good Democrat, would represent things 
right, and print every thing that was required of him." 
He then asked me, " if I could not raise even $120, with 

which a beginning could be made ? could not I get twenty 

28 
subscribers, even to advance $10 each? How sorry he 
was Tupper and Mercer were gone away. They would 
readily contribute. Would not I look about/' etc. I 
said, " I knew not a man that would advance a dollar." 
He seemed surprised that I did not eagerly offer my 
services as a runner to beg for him, and said, " I might 
look out if I pleased; that is," he added, "if I felt any 
interest in the thing." Now, I 'm at a loss to divine the 
drift of this set upon me. Was it to remind me to 
smother any rising thoughts within me, to renew my 
hints to him, of other calls for money? Was it to ex 
hibit me to Bollman in a character he would not appear 
to impose upon him? I own I am at a loss for a solution. But certainly, however solicitous he may be to 
revive the impartial observer, he was not indifferent to 
making use of this occasion for some other purpose. 
Smith, however, said, "he would look about him ; " and I 
abruptly took leave. Bollman kept silent during the 
mos^ of the visit. He is engaging in his appearance, but 
I have yet had no opportunity to catch any lines of his 
character, which I hope will not hereafter escape me. 
Swartwout is dispatched to Washington on some secret 
mission, which is as mat-apropos, during Wilkinson's ex 
amination, as Burr's disappearance from court. Swart 
wout, it is said, will be back on Thursday. Eaton has 
come forward to-day in court, to say the toast * was first 

* General Eaton's evidence on the trial went to prove that Burr medi 
tated a dissolution of the Union. Eaton, in order to rid himself of Burr's 
importunities, proposed the following toast at a dinner given to him 
(Eaton) at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> or Georgetown ; he could not distinctly recollect 
which : " The United States palsy to the brain that should plot to dismem

given at a public dinner given to him at Georgetown, 
which, being in or before December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>, contradicts 
what he before swore to on that subject. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

The court having been only opened to-day for the pur 
pose of adjourning until to-morrow, to accommodate the 
bar, who are obliged to attend the Court of Chancery, I 
spent an hour with Burr in miscellaneous conversation, 
during which Bob. Robison and Smith were present. 
The arrival in town of Poindexter and Williams, from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, being mentioned, and conjectures offered as to 
what Poindexter could say as a witness for the Government, Robison observed, " he was inclined to think Col. 
Burr was fortunate in having made his escape when he 
did from that country, as, had he delayed it for another 
day, he would probably have been seized, and have fallen 
into the hands of Wilkinson." Robison seemed unin 
formed altogether of the nature of Meade's stipulations 
with Burr, last January or February, in what was called 
the armistice at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. Burr now entered into a train 
of statements to show Robison how Meade had violated 
his engagements on that occasion. If he had made out 
such a story as he now told in the presence of Smith and 
myself, where we were not by, it might perhaps pass like 
other representations which have, I know not in how 
many instances, been received upon the credit of his 
word. But that he should tell any one, in our hearing, 
that Meade pledged his honor to him that our people 
should all keep their arms, when we know the solicitude 
with which he afterward had them all hid, and sunk in 
the river, and say, he was not taken a prisoner, under 
guard, to Washington in the Mississippi Territory, from 
the interview he had, as it was called, ^Yith Meade, at 
Cole's Creek, in pursuance of his forbearing to prefer 
resistance, which he might have made to a surrender of 
his person, it would indeed surpass all credibility, if he 
had not with the same temerity assured Wickham, the 
other day in court, "that the Mississippi militia, while 
ordered out against him, could hardly be kept by him 
from deserting to him by whole companies. What they 
might have been disposed to do, had he shown himself 
worthy of their support, is too far removed from what 
they did to need any attestation from us, or our friends, 
in that country. But young men, whom I can redeem 
from future connections with every incapacity but the 
talents for intrigue, must not be entangled in those snares, 
so imprudently or so rashly laid for their credulity. In 
deed, I am again disposed to call to my aid Cowles 
Meade's impression last winter, that Burr was at times 
deranged, as the only means of accounting for his occa 
sional rashness in his assertions. Certain I am, he ex 
hibited at that season every derangement but that of 
avoidable hazard ; and as his memory is confessedly 
strong, he can not now surely rely upon his facts, without 
a similar, if not a worse, apology. I saw to-day a curious 
parallel of Burr's character and my own, drawn by Wirt, 
in his speech, reported in the " Enquirer," on Wickham's 
motion to arrest the evidence in the treason case. I'll 
transcribe it hereafter. 
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wilkinson's cross-examination was continued this 
morning by Wickham, with great ability, and suspended until to-morrow, to give him time he desired for re 
flection, and further recurrence to his papers, and also to 
enable Burr to finish it to-morrow, as the latter is not 
well enough to attend to-day. Then came forward the 
ingenious Poindexter, who delivered a very petulant and 
dogmatical testimony, in the course of which he had the 
effrontery to state the whole affair of the alleged recog 
nizance of Burr taken by old Rodney, in a manner to in 
duce, if he could, a belief that Rodney was perfectly cor 
rect; that Burr had forfeited an original recognizance, 
and that Rodney was one of the best men living; while 
no honest man in the Territory believed a word of the 
stories that were told there of another recognizance or 
memorandum for one having been suppressed ; he even 
went so far as to say, he heard, and believed, that Harding had begun to write an original, but got tired before 
he finished it, and it was thrown under the table. ! 
Harding, my estimable friend, may you soon be able to 
scourge this paltry pettifogger, who further declared, on 
his oath, that the matter was now before the Supreme 
Court of the Territory, where the securities would get 
off, not upon the merits of the case, but because the 
Judge who bound them had not cognizance of the offense. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Burr attended to-day in court, and concluded the crossexamination of Wilkinson ; after which, Poindexter was

again called for, and was, if possible, a greater curiosity 
as a witness than he had been yesterday. His parade of 
his opinion of the jurisdiction of the courts in the Mis 
sissippi Territory, his strictures on the presentments hy 
Burr's grand jury there, his justification of his conduct 
as honorary aid-de-camp and Attorney General, and his 
insolence to Burr and his counsel, all exhibited him in a 
light which introduced a character into the piece now 
performing at the capitol, as novel as it was unexpected. 
Then succeeded a witness of a very opposite cast, a Mr. 
Trisley, one of the late grand jury here, who has riveted 
on Wilkinson's character and credit those fetters Jeffer 
son and himself were so long forging together for the 
fame and liberty of others. After a close struggle between opposite counsel, Wickham succeeded by his usual 
address in wresting from the prosecutors a very curious 
letter by Jefferson to Wilkinson, of the 3d of last January, which I must, if possible, get a copy of. Martin 
was both- yesterday and to-day more in his cups than 
usual, and though he spared neither his prudence nor his 
feelings, he was happy in all his hits. 11 o'clock, P. M. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wilkinson, though it was thought by many yesterday 
that his cross-examination was concluded, was, this morn 
ing, again further interrogated as to the import of his 
instructions to Lieutenant Pike, and the nature of his 
confidential intercourse with Kibby. But nothing could 
be got out of him as to the former; and, as to any dealing with Kibby, of the sort alluded to in Kibby's pub 
lished affidavit, he would no more confess it than that he 
is said, by the records of scandal, to have had in his youth 
with General G * * * . He produced two copies of 
alleged instructions to Pike. These papers, being of his 
own manufacture, left his adversaries, of course, to con 
tent themselves with whatever effect the suspicions arising from their questions might produce in the minds of 
the auditors, if not of the Judge. But the publication in 
the " Argus," to-day, of no less than six documents, offered by Wilkinson in the course of his examination, and 
rejected by the Judge as improper to be given in evidence, 
will operate a preponderating counterpoise in his favor. 
Before he withdrew, he appealed to the Court on the 
attempts that had been made, during his examination, 
upon his honor and veracity ; observing, " that it now 
would be easy for him to show his whole conduct in its 
true light, freed from all manner of doubt or suspicion 
of his motives, if Burr would produce the letter of the 
13th of May, alluded to in the ciphered letter, which 
would enable him to expose other letters from Burr 
which occasioned that letter." He then declared that 
Burr's assertion, " that the letter of the 13th of May had 
been put out of Burr's power into the hands of a third 
person, with Wilkinson's knowledge," was unfounded, 
and destitute of all manner of truth ; that Burr knew 
the very reverse was the fact ; and with warmth and as 
perity of language, he again challenged him to produce it. 
Burr, with an air of dignity and composure which, I think, 
he borrowed from an opinion that he is not bound to give 
Wilkinson a meeting out of court, demanded whether this 
sort of language and such topics were giving testimony ; 
and then observed, " that the General was there to tell 
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, upon his 
oath, and should reserve other matters for another place." 
Wilkinson now withdrew ; but who can not perceive that, 
in this scene, the craft of the advocate shrunk from the 
charge of his enemy. I examined, soon after this, Gates 
and Jones the latter of whom fully proved the terms of 
a parole agreement to go down the river with me last 
winter in a manner to defeat every effect the testimony 
of the Hendersons could possibly produce to my preju 
dice. I find Burr has a heavy bill against the United 
States, on account of advances he says he has made to 
agents employed for summoning his witnesses. How 
many have undertaken this service for him J[ know not; 
some I do know who advanced their own money, in ex 
pectation of being refunded by Burr or the United States. 
But how far Burr will be indemnified for his advances in 
this business may be guessed from the transaction already 
narrated of the manreuvre, by which he put Ellis, one of 
his creditors, in cash. (See conclusion to notes of 23d of 
August.) But Ellis, who was to-day examined, parried 
some lounges made at him, during his examination on 
this subject, by saying, "it was a verbal summons he got 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> the proper one was served upon him here." 
I will now set down here Wirt's parallel of Burr's char 
acter and my own. After having stated that Burr was 
manoeuvring to effect his escape from the prosecutions, by 
having me sacrificed in his stead, he asks, " By what sort 
of legerdemain is it, that Burr wants to shuffle himself 
down to the bottom of the pack, and turn me up, principal traitor ? "# He then proceeds as follows : " Who, then, 
is Aaron Burr and what the part which he has borne in 
this transaction ? " 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I called on Burr this morning, when he, at last, mentioned to me, during a short tete a tete, that he was 
preparing to go to England ; that the time was now aus 
picious for him ; and he wished to know whether I could 
give him letters. I answered, " that I supposed when he 
said England, he meant <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, as his business would 
probably be with people in office ; that I knew none of 

:;: Will any man say that Blennerhassett was the principal, and Burr 
but an accessory? Who will believe that Burr, the author and projector 
of the plot, who raised the forces, who enlisted the men, and who procured 
the funds for carrying it into execution, was made a cat's-paw of? Will 
any man believe that Burr, who is a soldier, bold, ardent, restless, and 
aspiring, the great actor whose brain conceived, and whose hand brought, 
the plot into operation, that he should sink down into an accessory, and 
that Blennerhassett should be elevated into a principal? He would startle 
at once at the thought. Aaron Burr, the contriver of the whole conspiracy, 
to every body concerned in it, was as the sun to the planets which sur 
round him. Did he not bind them in their respective orbits, and give 
them their light, their heat, and their motion? Yet he is to be con 
sidered an accessory, and Blennerhassett is to be the principal, who, 
thus deluded from his interest and his happiness, thus seduced from 
the paths of innocence and peace, thus confounded in the toils that were 
deliberately spread for him, and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit 
and genius of another this man, thus ruined and undone, and made to 
play a subordinate part in this grand drama of guilt and treason, this man 
is to be called the principal offender; while he, by whom he was thus 
plunged in misery, is comparatively innocent, a mere accessory ! Is this 
reason? Is it law? Is it humanity? Sir, neither the human heart nor 
the human understanding will bear a perversion so monstrous and absurd ! 
so shocking to the soul ! so revolting to reason ! Let Aaron Burr, then, 
not shrink from the high destination which he has courted ; and having 
already ruined Blennerhassett in fortune, character, and happiness for 
ever, let him not attempt to finish the tragedy by thrusting that ill-fated 
man between himself and punishment. Extract from W. Wirts Speech. 
the present ministry, nor did I believe I had a single 
acquaintance in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>." He replied, " he meant to 
visit every part of the country, and would be glad to get 
letters to any one." I said, that I would think of it ; that 
I might discover whether I had any friends there, whom 
it would be an object worth his attention to know, and 
took leave. Thus it is, this strange man continues to 
expose his inconsistency with himself, rather than lay 
aside the mysterious mask, with which he has ever 
sought, and still continues, to disguise his very hints a 
practice, I believe, he has not departed from in any 
instance, from "Wilkinson down to myself. We can only 
conjecture, therefore, his designs. For my part, I am 
disposed to suspect he has no serious purpose of reviving 
any of his speculations in America, or even of returning 
from Europe, if he can get there. His anxiety to elude 
his creditors is, I believe, occupation enough for his 
energies, which are little, except in his reveries. Out of 
them he tells different stories to different persons, enjoining confidence from all, but committing himself in nothing to any one. I have suspected for some time, however, 
he really does dream of appearing in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, with some 
thing, according to his ideas, in the nature of a suite. 
Some weeks past, he consulted De Pestre, to learn from 
him how much money would be wanted to enable him to 
go and return. He said, he supposed that $10,000 might 
answer. De Pestre told him, that would depend on the 
nature of his business, and the time it would require to 
transact it. But he has more lately been engaged in en 
deavoring to attach to him some young men who may 
accompany him. I yet only know, positively, two. Sam. 
Swartwout was enraptured with the prospect, and still 
may feast his imagination upon it ; though I could not 
resist the propensity I felt to convey to this fine young 
man, without his suspecting from whence it came, a curb, 
which may restrain his generous ardor and innocent 
credulity. His relation, Major Smith, has endeavored to 
apply it. Bob. Robison was the other, and, to save him, 
my breast heaved with indignation against his tempter, 
while my heart labored for the danger of my young 
friend, when I found that his property was Mr. Burr's 
object; for Burr, it seems, in the first place, certified 
himself by inquiries of Major Smith, that Robison's 
father was wealthy, and Robert an only child, before he 
proposed the voyage to him, which I find he had the 
insolence to introduce by telling him, Smith, Robison 
would be much pleased to accompany him, as Mr. Blennerhassett had assured him, than which nothing is more 
false. But Burr is as careless of his facts as of his 
religion, where neither is exposed to scrutiny ; and any 
liberty with them may advance his purpose for the moment. I had seasonably prepared this young man, who 
will to-morrow make his escape to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>, from the 
fascinations of this serpent. I was much entertained for 
two or three hours by the performance on the piano by a 
young Frenchman, who is a fine performer, and made me 
acquainted with some new music of Haydn and others, 
which he executed with masterly skill and expression. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

This day was chiefly consumed with hearing testimony 
adduced to prove Eaton's incompetency or discredit ; 
which failed, according to the legal rules of evidence, 
though Eaton himself has already fully anticipated the 
object of his adversaries. I am very unhappy in failing 
to hear from ISTatchez, to relieve my anxiety for Harnian. 
But why should I presume to pray for the removal of my 
trouble for him and his mother, when I know how un 
worthy I have been of the many blessings I have already 
enjoyed in them. I have ever thought too highly of 
Dominick, in prejudice to his brother ; my late cares for 
the latter have equalized the account. 

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Burr and Martin made a considerable blunder to-day, 
by producing a Major Brough, to the discredit of Wil 
kinson, as they thought. The Major, it is true, told some 
curious stories to the Court and to the General, as unexpected by the Judge, probably, as they were unpalatable 
to the Brigadier ; but the effect only tended to show both 
equally rivals in treachery to the State, if not to them 
selves. Burr would gladly have pretermitted the exhi 
bition of this scene, but it was too late ; the curtain had 
risen, and "Peacham" and "Locket" stood confessed in 
every line of their characters, except a compromise of 
their differences. But as, in such cases, " honest men 
come by their own," the public feelings on the Mississippi 
will necessarily be relieved, by the disclosures of this witness, from the insult and mortification of again seeing 
Wilkinson command in that country. It is in vain that 
Wilkinson has promised to destroy the credit of this witness. The Major has brandished his sword with such 
effect and address, on this occasion, that he has not only 
cut down the General, but even disarmed his auxiliaries 
Jefferson, Dearborn and Rodney who have so long 
fought by his side throughout, this criminal warfare. In 
short, unless this testimony, which, from its effect upon 
Jefferson, etc., I regard as the most interesting that has 
occurred, can be totally obliterated from the reports of 
the present motley proceedings at the capitol, and the 
Major be absolutely foxed, the execration of the admin 
istration will soon be sown on the Mississippi, to produce 
a crop similar to that which sprung from the teeth of the 
hydra. I regret the whole narrative will not probably 
appear in full before Robertson's report of the whole 
proceedings. This evening, my friend Hendren, who has 
again come up to town chiefly to see me, has called to 
express his satisfaction at the near prospect of my restoration to my family, .and to solicit my acceptance of a 
horse he has a long time destined for me, together with 
whatever money I may have occasion for. He has duly 
tempered the frankness of these propositions with sentiments of corresponding delicacy. I, alas ! have made no 
better return to this generosity than words that lightened 
not the burden that he had laid upon my heart, which, I 
hope, God will give it strength to carry to my grave. 
How long have I sought, through life, friends without my 
family; and where have I found any, until the hand of 
Divine mercy pointed their regards to that piety that has 
supported the patience of my distress. I have declined 
Hendren's favors, and quieted his solicitude to serve 
me, by requesting him to look out for a few negroes 
I want to purchase. He will see me again next Monday. 
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wilkinson was not ready to-day to undertake his attack 
upon the credit of Major Brough, but he will attempt it 
to-morrow. Nothing was done, of any consequence, in 
court to-day. Soon after it adjourned, I took a letter for 
my wife to the " Eagle," to go by Col. McKee, who leaves 
for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> to-morrow. I had there the happiness to see 
Doctor Commins, just arrived. He made me happy, by 
assuring me my boys were running about on the 25th of 
August, when he last saw them, and has brought me a 
packet, which I shall receive in the morning. I find I 
have omitted to note a very curious discovery made in 
court last Saturday. Nothing less than letters of McKee's, 
some of thenT dated in January and February last, produced by Wilkinson, proving the Col. to have been with 
us on the Mississippi, far more as a spy than a friend. 
The capillaries of the Colonel's physiognomy, during the 
reading of the said letters, were swollen to bursting. The 
man, I believe, would have hissed upon immersion in 
cold water. He was struck dumb, and, upon his release, 
went off in a tangent. Burr can't endure a hint of this 
incident; and yet he has since been more than once 
closeted with the Colonel. Can he find no better friends, 
or is he really deranged ? 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wilkinson has not kept his promise of to-day, dis 
crediting the testimony of Major Brough. An unim 
portant witness or two were examined by way of killing 
time, which now seems to be the favorite object of the 
prosecutors. Afterward, Hay at last announced that the 
evidence was closed on the part of the prosecution, but 
reserved his right to examine, without restriction, all of 
those witnesses that may arrive, according to his fancy, 
which was conceded to him. He then entered upon his 
speech, to comment on the evidence, which appeared to 
me the best effort I have yet heard from him ; it was per 
spicuous and somewhat ingenious. I have therefore 
taken pretty close notes of all such parts of it as appeared 
to me to be worthy of notice, or particularly applicable to 
myself. He spoke, however, to empty benches until the 
rising of the Court, which was, for his accommodation, 
protracted half an hour longer than usual. A few 
minutes before he stopped, I was much diverted by a 
display of his irritability, which was excited by McRae's 
interrupting him with a whisper to stop at 4 o'clock. 
Upon this, the attorney fired with indignation, and in 
his wrath very plainly exhibited his contempt for his co 
adjutor, by telling him he would not be interrupted by 
him ; and then endeavoring fruitlessly to compose his ire, 
he lamented the condition of counsel, that could neither 
agree with those on their own side, or those who were 
opposed to them. I sent to Doctor Commins, this morn 
ing, for the packet he brought me from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, but not 
having received it, I called upon him this evening, 
when he delivered it to me in a wretched state, it having been taken from him in the Creek Nation of Indians, by Col. Hawkins, the agent of that tribe, who, 
after examining my letter-bag, and every original letter 
my wife had sent me, except perhaps two sealed letters 
from herself, and, after taking such extracts and copies 
of the whole as he chose, then returned to Doctor Commins as many as he thought proper. This outrage I 
shall have formally stated in an affidavit by the Doctor, 
in order to procure an attachment against the Colonel. I 
spent a very pleasant evening at the Musical Society, 
where I met Mrs. Chevalier and Mrs. "Wickham. They 
seemed pleased with some performances, in which I took 
a part, particularly a quartette of Pleyel's. Mrs. Chev 
alier gave me some hospitable reproaches for the scarcity 
of my visits. I believe her husband a most generous and 
benevolent man, which his countenance fully bespeaks. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

It is a little singular that my birthday should yesterday 
have passed by without my having noticed it ; but this 
has been the case for several of the last years of my life, 
and T suppose the reason is, that my mind is hardly occu 
pied once a year in thinking of myself. I may have 
taken my height and weight, perhaps full twenty times in 
the course of my life ; but I am certain I never remem 
bered, much less noted, the amount of either, so that I 
could recollect it one hour after trial. Yesterday, then, I 
completed my forty-second or forty-third year; for my 
father and mother could never agree whether I was born 
in 1764 or 1765, though they coincided as to the day, fixing it on the 8th of October. But at such a distance from 
my suffering family, I can not estimate how much hap 
piness or misery they have been preparing for my future 
years. Hay finished his speech to-day. He was followed 
by Randolph, in a style that will read much better than 
it was delivered. He relied chiefly on the effect of Burr's 




acquittal, and arguments drawn from the Constitution. 
As to me, he seemed to forget my case altogether, save 
so far as his concern for Burr obliged him to mention my 
name and writings. This, I suspect, will also be the case 
with Wickham. Nous verrons. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

The Court does not sit to-day, at the request of the 
prosecutors ; yet they are eternally complaining of the 
tedious length of the trial, and their own confinement 
and sufferings by it. The accused have no sufferings, it 
seems, worthy of their notice. I have to-day spent much 
time in painful reflections on the state of my affairs with 
Burr. It appears by a statement of my private account 
with him, so far as I can now collect all my charges 
against him here, for he has but two credits, he is in 
debted to me in a balance of $2,864.96, independent of 
my account against him, for what I have already paid 
and lost, by my indorsement of the bill held by Miller for 
$4,000. It will be useless, or worse, for me to attempt to 
appear at Marietta without a sum of money, if not sufficient to discharge Miller's claim, at least necessary to 
enable me to get my negroes away from Ohio, if that is 
now possible, and to redeem some few valuable articles 
of my property that have been sacrificed at sheriff's 
sales. I have therefore imagined a method of forcing 
Burr's exertions to raise money for me, which is the most 
likely to succeed. It is founded on the principle of 
effecting through his vanity and interest what it is now 
evident I should in vain seek through his justice or 

generosity. I will hint to him my ability to introduce 
29 
him into the first circles in England, by introductory 
letters ; at the same time, showing him my expectations 
of becoming soon possessed of a large fortune in Europe, 
from which, I doubt not, I shall be enabled to engage his 
best endeavors, if not his warmest interest. This plan 
I shall put in execution to-morrow, of which I will note 
the effect upon him. Leaving it to ripen in his meditations for a week, I shall then open my present distresses to 
him in detail, and present him with his account. It is 
a little painful, I own, to feel oneself obliged to bring 
even a bad man into the path of his duty by artifice. 
But the details of the manoeuvre, when examined, will, I 
trust, do me no discredit with my friends. 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

It being very warm and dusty this morning, I sent to 
John Banks for a horse to visit his family and Chevalier's, 
they living two miles apart, and take the benefit of a 
short ride. But I previously called upon Burr, whom I 
found alone and in good spirits. He attributed the re 
moval of his indisposition exclusively to the effect of my 
pills, and his inflamed eye was nearly cured. Daniel 
Clark and Mr. Powers had arrived from Orleans to sup 
port the depositions of Derbigeny and the younger Mercier, to the confirmation of Wilkinson's character and 
ruin. Availing myself of such a state of things, I entered into desultory conversation affecting all freedom of 
thought from any particular object. The affair of the 
Leopard and Chesapeake being mentioned, Burr observed, 
that though the difference between the United States and 
Great Britain on that account might be expected to be 



"FRIENDS AT COURT." 451 

soon settled, there were many other causes of dispute 
which would not soon be removed ; that this was a most 
auspicious moment for his purposes to visit England, and 
he had no doubt he could, in serving himself and his 
friends there, show them, the ministry, their best interests 
in a manner that would convince their judgment. This 
was the best opportunity I could have desired for my pur 
pose. I now told him, as he happened to be alone, I had 
been reflecting on the application he had lately made to 
me for letters to England, to assist the better means he 
no doubt possessed of establishing his intercourse with 
the best society in that country. I regretted that, through 
the fluctuations of parties there, I had no acquaintance 
with any member of the Administration. But I had 
thought of three noblemen, with whom I had been at 
school at Westminster, and there intimate with them all, 
though I had never since met with any of them, except 
Lord Sackville, who had visited me in Ireland. To Lord 
S., therefore, I could write, and also to Lords Elgin and 
Courtenay. The latter I was very intimate with at 
school ; and the former, I presumed, from the circum 
stance of his having been not long since ambassador at 
the courts of Petersburgh and Constantinople, must be 
much respected by the present ministers, if not in office 
with them. To all these personages, I said, I thought I 
could properly address a mere letter of introduction, 
which if it would not of itself produce the end proposed, 
would not fail to do so when supported by the appearance he would make in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, the address with which 
he would be as impressive there as here, and the distin 
guished rank he lately occupied in the American Government. The effect of this communication was rapture. 
The whole man was changed. With all his studied re 
serve, he could not restrain his transports, which agitated 
his countenance and his movements far more than the 
news of a capital prize in the lottery could have done. I 
now, after pausing a little, to give his reflections time to 
recover his usual composure, asked if he remembered a 
hint I had sometime since given him, that I entertained 
some expectations of hereafter becoming easy in my circumstances, and perhaps wealthy. " Yes," he hastily 
replied, " very well.' 7 I then alluded to a communication 
by letter from a friend in Ireland, which I would now 
acquaint him with, and from which I might expect, if my 
prospects should be realized, possibly to meet him in 
those circles in Europe, into which I proposed to introduce him ; now drawing from my pocket A. Martin's 
letter of 16th of last May, which luckily contained no 
other matter than that I wished him to see, and some 
political news. I presented it to him. He read it delib 
erately, over and over, and I now beheld myself estab 
lished in an influence upon his feelings, and a consideration from his notice, to which I am persuaded I had 
never before possessed the least title. Hey-day ! behold 
the wretched and beggared Blennerhassett about to rise 
out of the misery in which I have plunged him, and his 
unhappy family, into wealth and consequence. The heir, 
too, of a nobleman ! His new wealth and his dignified 
connections must supply me with better materials for my 
projected speculations than all others I have hitherto col 
lected. His connections and his purse shall lay the foun 
dation under which I will again bury his credulity and 



453 

rear upon it my aggrandizement. I am persuaded all 
this, and probably much more to the same purpose, entered and pervaded the mind of this arch-financier, with 
the velocity of light, in an instant. Be it so. Let him 
outwit himself. He shall have my letters to the British 
nobleman, and may make his own use of them, If he 
will first exonerate me from Miller's demand, and pay 
or secure the balance he owes me before we part. Other 
wise, we break upon a ivrit, and for every thing else, I 
fear not his address in future. 

Chevalier, as usual, pressed me to dinner. I have such 
full confidence in his goodness that I believe I shall venture to request him to indorse or negotiate a bill on Phil 
adelphia for me. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I am miserable this morning, by being denied a letter 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. The season advances, and witnesses continue to arrive so constantly, that I am filled with appre 
hensions of being unable to descend the Ohio before the 
breaking up of that river. Martin commenced his speech 
on the evidence this morning, and only reached the first 
full stop at the hour of adjournment. He will probably 
hold out full two days more. 

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Martin kept on his feet again to-day until the adjournment. He has only come to the second period. I had 
this morning an extremely friendly note from Chevalier, 
telling me he never lends his name to any body, but has 
one thousand dollars at my command, which I have accepted, to send to the sale by Commins. I have spent a 
pleasant evening at Banks', where I often take Smith 
with me, as he knows no one here. Banks has given me 

some lines he made on the late Miss , which I will 

here transcribe, as they deserve preservation : 

SWEET SHADE. 

Within our hearts, thy mem'ry is embalmed 
Beyond the usual gifts that grace thy sex; 
Thy various virtues and acquirements shone: 
The dignity of worth (like thine) it would 
Degrade to blazon each peculiar claim 
That marked thy value here ; for all who knew 
Thee felt its force, and every tongue seemed 
Emulous to praise. The young, enraptured, 
Hung upon thy name; with equal rev'rence 
And grateful love hailed the bright exemplar 
That adorned the sex. Pleased with the theme, 
The aged matron, too, for this laid by 
The frigid caution of maturer years ; 
With joy exulting, joined the general praise, 
And wished, a pious wish, her offspring might 
Through life's alluring scenes tread the chaste paths 
That marked Eliza's steps. 

One kindred trait, that marked thy latest hour, 
Unknown to all but to thy weeping friends, 
Who clung around the sable couch of Death, 
'T were impious not to note. The God who smote 
Still blessed thee to the last. Its powers thy mind 
Retained ; while, conscious of th' approaching call, 
Thy steadfast soul still stood serene and firm. 
No tumult there, no dread, no terror could 
Disturb the heart which purity inspired. 
'T was Resignation's calm I Thy closing eyes, 
'T is true, a transient tremor felt, and o'er 
The fevered cheek a drop let fall. 0! 't was 
A sacred gem, incalculably rich ! 
A legacy divine ; for others' woes 
It fell. 'T was filial sympathy, which, like 
A shock electric, struck the palsied nerve, 
Impervious but to this. Dim though thy sight, 
Yet still thou sawest a parent's 
Agonizing pangs ; a precious pearl 
Thou gav'st ; and with the boon expir'd. 
Sweet Shade ! this tribute is not half thy due. 
Alas ! too soon we pay the solemn meed ; 
Yet bear it on thy wing; 't will pleasing prove 
A passport to the skies ; and when, blest Shade, 
Thy sister-spirits, who thy flight await 
At Heav'n's portal, shall peruse the scroll, 
In strains celestial, not unknown to thee, 
They '11 chant the theme divine, until it reach 
The Throne of Grace. There, in regal state, 
The King of Kings, in all the majesty 
Of Heaven arrayed, with sweet solacing smile, 
Shall hail thy welcome to the realms above, 
While myriads of the just around him sing : 
"This the reward of virtuous acts below, 
Eternal life and bliss for evermore 1 " 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Martin at last concluded at 4 o'clock, with the adjournment this evening. Want of arrangement, verbosity, and 
eternal repetitions, have more than sated the malice of 
his enemies. 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

MoRae consumed this whole day with somewhat less 
discredit to himself than might have been expected. It 
appears that he is now the only one of the three prose 
cuting counsel that labors to bolster up the credit and 
consistency of Wilkinson. Hay has declared, out of 
court, " he has washed his hands of him." I had a 
friendly letter from Devereux, announcing his being 
about to return to Ireland, where he expects to recover 
his estate, and. assuring me, with much concern for my 
present sufferings, his actions shall prove his friendship, 
whenever his means can give it that operation he now so 
generously laments he can not direct to my succor. He 
assures me, however, Pierce Butler, Esq., of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
has directed him, without solicitation, to invite me to call 
upon him for any pecuniary aid I may need. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wickham followed Martin, instead of McRae, yester 
day, and was, I think, far below his former efforts. He 
occupied the day nearly. It was to-day McRae exhib 
ited, as I have just mentioned, not having had time to 
write down yesterday's notes till this evening. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wirt spoke very much to engage the fancy of his hearers, to-day, without affecting their understanding; for he 
can not reason upon the facts before him, and can no more 
conduct a law argument than I could raise a mountain. 
As Junius says of the king, " The feather that adorns 
him supports his flight." " Strip him of his plumage 
and you fix him to the earth." He attempted to be sar 
castic on all his opponents. Randolph he charged with 
a decay of professional and oratorical powers, which keep 
pace with the march of his years. Martin he upbraided 
with ill earned and unmerited fame, which had disappointed the expectations of the Virginia bar, before which 
he had shone through so many moons, but had never yet 
appeared in any of the phases of the law. I mention this, 
as a specimen of his efforts in the figurative style, to show 
how unhappy he is in his researches into those mines of 
taste and study which the fancy of an orator never ex^ 
plores in vain. Wickham he boldly accused of unadorned 
plagiarism, in appropriating to himself the arguments of 
Dallas and Lewis in the case of Fries, and even expressing their ideas with inferior eloquence. I took some notes 
of this orator's performance, which Wickham was very 
glad to get, as he was absent during the delivery of what 
w^as so pointedly applied to himself. " O that mine enemy 
would write a book ! " Wilkinson is writing one, which, 
some say, is to ruin not only Burr, but Jefferson too. 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I staid at home until evening, owing to the high wind 
and dust that annoyed every one who ventured abroad. 
But I drank tea, and spent the evening until 10 o'clock, 
at Mrs. Chevalier's. I there met Mrs. David Randolph, 
who is a middle-aged lady, and very accomplished; of 
charming manners, and possessing a masculine mind, 
From this lady, the near relation of the President, and 
whose brother is married to his daughter, I heard more 
pungent strictures upon Jefferson's head and heart, be 
cause they were better founded than any I had ever heard 
before, and she certainly uttered more treason than my 
wife ever dreamed of; for she ridiculed the experiment 
of a Republic in this country, which the vices and incon 
stancy of parties and the people had too long shown to 
be nothing more than annual series of essays to complete 
a work ill begun, and which appeared to be nearly worn 
out before it was half finished. But " she always was 
disgusted with the fairest ideas of a modern Republic, 
however she might respect those of antiquity." And as 
for the treason, " she cordially hoped, whenever Burr, or 
any one else, again attempted to do any thing, the Atlan 
tic States would be comprised in the plan." She talked 
much of Thomas Moore, with whom she was highly 
pleased here, and recited some favorite extracts from 
him ; but she is very much mortified by the indiscriminate censure of Virginia, with which he has requited the 
hospitality and consideration with which he was uni 
versally treated in this State his only two exceptions 
from his strictures being Wickham and the Chief Justice ; 
but in the former he could discover no accomplishment, 
beyond professional skill and a slight knowledge of 
French, with a talent for repartee, and an imagination 
denied all favors which it would in vain solicit from 
nature and the sciences. Of the Chief Justice, I can not 
speak, out of the precincts of the law, or his politics, 
which I already begin to fear will exhibit his heart, as 
unlike those of Hardwick or Cambden, as his mind may 
resemble theirs." I also obtained from this interesting 
lady some sketches of the characters of General Dayton 
and Bollman, with both of whom her acute penetration 
seems to have had sufiicient opportunities of informing 
her judgment. The sentence of my moral craniology on 
these heads thus presented to me was this, that the one 
is that of an unprincipled speculator and crafty politician, 
who never appeals to his reason but to deceive, and never 
departs from it but to be sensual. The other is that of 
an individual possessing similar talents, more highly re 
fined by nature, but less consolidated by experience, with 
syren faculties of speech and manner, never exerted to 
captivate, but to destroy their victim, and a temperament 
of antipathy, rather than of inclination to the sex. I, 
this morning, closed long letters to A. Martin, for Ireland, 
after, I believe, full two months' neglect. I have so long 
been dosed with the incessant vexations of my prosecution, that I sometimes imagine my apathy is better lent 
me to befit me for the future frowns of unsteady fortune, 
than to prepare me for the insidious smiles. I am already 
her puppet. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wirt concluded with perhaps a better two hours' dis 
play of his powers than he has yet exhibited. Lieutenant 
Jackson, at last, made his appearance, but fell very short 
of what the prosecutors expected of him, from the pur 
port of his affidavits, which they have published in the 
" Argus," and of his own infamy : though he made out 
enough of treachery and perjury, probably, to swell the 
current of suspicion against Burr's treasonable designs. 
Swartwout* has sent "Wilkinson a challenge, but with 
out effect. 



* Swartwout sent a challenge to General Wilkinson by Israel Smith, 
which he (W.) refused to read, saying that "he held no correspondence 
with traitors or conspirators." This raised Swartwout's ire, and induced 
him to publish the following in the " Virginia Gazette:" 
To His EXCELLENCY BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAMES WILKINSON. 

SIR : When once the chain of infamy grapples to a knave, every new 
link creates a fresh sensation of detestation and horror. As it gradually 
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I have said nothing of my relief, yesterday, by a letter 
from my beloved, bearing the intelligence of her recovery 
from a fever. Who would think I was glad to receive 
this letter ! I had been miserable for three weeks in ap 
prehension for Harman. This new calamity has affected 
me with a kind of lethargy, from which I awake often in 
surprise, to wonder that we are all four alive, as if life, 
upon any terms, was unnatural in our present prospects. 
0, Melancholy ! how long wilt thou brood upon me. I 
have begun a letter to my wife. Sustain her strength, O 
God, who approvest her virtue, and can best assuage her 
sufferings. Mr. Marshall, at length, has delivered an 



or precipitately unfolds itself, we behold in each succeeding connection, 
and arising from the same corrupt and contaminated source, the same base 
and degenerate conduct. I could not have supposed that you would have 
completed the catalogue of your crimes by adding to the guilt of treachery, 
forgery and perjury, the accomplishment of cowardice. But every succeeding day presents you in a new light to the public, and plunges you still 
deeper in crime and ignominy. Having failed in two different attempts to 
procure an interview with you, such as no gentleman of honor could refuse, 
I have only to pronounce and publish you to the world as a coward and 
poltroon. One word more before I take my leave. This is a critical moment 
in the life of your Excellency. Your reputation is gone for ever, and your 
life totters on the verge of dissolution. As you can not pretend to the es 
teem of any man living, you should have sought a momentary reputation 
in the applause of even your enemies. You should have been brave, and died 
like a man. Your enemies would then have forgotten the wrongs you had 
done them. Your country would have been appeased, and even Judas for 
given. You should have considered that there is some small merit in even 
a villain's bravery ; it was all you were supposed to possess this side of 
the grave. You should have made much of it; it might have served to 
wipe away some portion of the stain which your treachery and turpitude 
have fixed upon your character. S. SWARTWOUT. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 2lst October, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
elaborate opinion, purporting that he can not commit any 
of us for treason ; not because we had none in our hearts, 
but because we did none with our hands. But the last 
article has determined him to commit me for trial, to 
Ohio, for a misdemeanor. Burr is, of course, ordered on 
this new dance. I shall, however, I fancy, leave the little 
emperor to exhibit in it alone ; for it is now time I 
should withdraw behind the scenes, even though I should 
employ .Duane to shift them. I shall therefore set out to 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, first for this object, and next to close my 
pecuniary affairs with Burr there, which I could not do 
here. I have given bail for my appearance at Chillicothe, the 4th of January ; bondsmen, Smith and 
Commins. 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Burr is in a sort of keeping at his own house, en 
deavoring to get all his bail renewed in the civil suits 
here depending against him. Martin has become his 
security, I believe, to the amount of $15,000. How much 
of this he may eventually sink in the purchase of the 
old staple of experience, he will ascertain in about six 
months. 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Wrote to my wife a letter to go by Ashley, which I 
will not close until the moment before I leave this town. 
It will reach her, and, I trust, tend to support her until I 
can escape, and then into Florida with her, if necessary, 
which I am determined to attempt, rather than play a 
part in a second trial, which would separate me from my 
family, probably, for not less than a year from hence. 
Was I criminal in seeking some little refuge from my 
trouble this evening at the Musical Society ? I met there 
Mesdames Wickham, Chevalier and the Misses M. I 
only took a part in one quartette, by particular desire of 
those ladies. Midnight. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Breakfasted at Mrs. Chevalier's, where I met a pleasant 
party. At ten o'clock I rode out to visit Banks, and pre 
scribe for an indisposition with which he is affected. 
Smith, being finally discharged by the Chief Justice, left 
me yesterday for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. I am endeavoring to obtain a lot of negroes, in partnership with Dr. Commins, 
though I fear we shall not succeed. This evening visited 
Wickham, to fee him with a few words. He thinks, in 
case Government should be disposed to desire my conviction at Chillicothe, Woodbridge's evidence will enable 
them easily to affect it. Revisited and spent the evening 
with Banks. He has offered to lend me one hundred 
dollars, which I shall probably accept, to enable me to 
return Chevalier's money. I take a horse and gig from 
Banks, as there is no conveyance from hence, in any pub 
lic or private carriage, for ten .days to come. Burr, Mar 
tin, Commins, and myself, with two servants, will probably form a cavalcade to move to-morrow or next day. I 
must raise money in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, on chances, and even 
strain a point with Commius, there to aid me whatever 
success I may have with Burr. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
I have been all day too ambulatory to spend a moment 
with these notes, before now, 11, P. M. I am just re 
turned from a two-mile walk in the dark, to take leave 
of the family of my friend, John Banks, who has kindly 
pressed me to borrow the largest sum, I believe, he could 
spare. And before I lie down to take two hours' rest, 
before I am called up to set off in the stage for the Federal city, I must note my having closed a letter I began 
several days ago to my wife, to go by Ashley, who will 
commence his journey to-morrow or the next day. My 
excellent friend Jos. Lewis, I find by letter from him this 
evening, has removed my fears for my credit and honor, 
by remitting to Mr. Chevalier 1,000, to replace that sum 
lately lent me by Mr. C. The house it seems, in Philadelphia, must still suspend my credit, on account of the 
removal of Sander's attachment. But J. L. will lend his 
generous friendship to succor that honor of a friend in 
distress, who is not, I trust, unworthy of the sympathies 
of his liberal heart. His counsel will soon direct my dis 
tracted cares to peace. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>, TUESDAY, OCT. 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Luther Martin has just made his final immersion into 
the daily bath of his faculties, after a series of apparitions, in all the phases of his accustomed orbit. Whether 
in a stage-coach, or a tavern, he is indefatigable, under 
the united stimulus of egotism and benevolence, to harrass 
the gratitude or tax the patience of his friends. At 3 
o'clock, A. M., on Saturday morning, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, he 
joined us in the coach, and neither the privation of sleep, 
nor the fatigue of the journey, have in the least checked 
his loquacity, or lessened his good humor. He read to 
me an able pamphlet, on the subject of Jefferson's rejection of the new British Treaty, while we were jolting and 
jarring over as bad a road as any country can lament, 
with more dispatch than I could peruse it in my chair. 
His strong memory made him interesting all the way, in 
his anecdotes and stories; and he is not unhappy in his 
powers of ridicule, which is well pointed, until it soon 
becomes blunted by the suggestions of his benevolence 
and the abrasions of his verbosity, which, like the revolutions of a grindstone, soon wear away the subject ap 
plied to it, without undergoing in itself any sensible dim 
inution. We spent last night at Alexandria, where we 
recruited our strength by a good night's rest, and reached 
this city to*day, by a packet-boat, about 1, P. M. Here, 

at Hotel, Martin has kept up an incessant fire 

against Democrats and the Administration, for he has 
had no want of that ammunition with which he always 
primes and loads for such duty. In our own room, occu 
pied by Commins, Martin and myself, he is not content 
to confine his feats for the gratification of ourselves and 
a few occasional visitors. He has several times carried 
his arms into the enemies' country I mean the public 
room occupied chiefly by members of Congress, with 
many of whom he has no acquaintance, while all admire 
and acknowledge him privileged. I had the satisfaction 
of reading the President's message in half an hour after 
it was communicated to-day to Congress. The news is 
here, that Jefferson will yet support Wilkinson, though 
he may not find a more respectable Democrat than McRae 
to back him. Yet he says nothing in the message of the 
General's honor as a soldier, or his fidelity as a citizen. 
He now speaks only of his energy, which, in conjunction 
with the exertions of the army and the patriotism of the 
militia, dissipated the plots that were formed on the Mis 
sissippi. The same paragraph of the message opens by 
implicating a contingency that may induce the Government party in Congress to impeach Mr. Marshall, by sig 
nifying a doubt, whether we have not still the use of our 
necks through the misconduct of the Judge. Should the 
latter suffer, 't were penance for that timidity of conduct, 
which was probably as instrumental in keeping him from 
imbruing his hands in our blood as it was operative in 
inducing him to continue my vexations, to pacify the 
menaces and clamorous yells of the cerberus of Democ 
racy with a sop which he would moisten, at least, with 
the tears of my family. Should this be well founded, 
what pity would sacrifice to his sufferings ; and if it is 
undoubtedly true, that in a private conversation he had 
with Martin, soon after the latter first arrived in Rich 
mond, he observed to him, " that it would be difficult or 
dangerous for a jury to venture to acquit Burr, however 
innocent they might think him," who hence will believe 
that the greatest talents lodged in such nerves are not, 
when exercised in the judgment-seat, rather a public 
curse executed on a nation, than a natural blessing con 
ferred upon the individual. Besides, the seasonable ap 
pearance, at this crisis, of a pamphlet by J. Daveiss, the 
Judge's brother-in-law, and late District Federal Attorney 
for Kentucky, removed from his office, for his premature 
and unsuccessful prosecution of Burr ; the indiscriminate 
censure, in this pamphlet, of Jefferson, "Wilkinson and 

Burr ; the probable information the Judge must have had 
30 
of this intended publication, when he opened to the pros 
ecutors as wide a field of investigation as they desired on 
their motion for our recommitment ; and, in short, the 
well-known spirit of clanship and co-operation with 
which the Marshalls and all their connections are so uni 
formly animated all these motives will clearly explain 
how readily the Judge must be disposed to favor alike 
the ruin of Burr, "Wilkinson and Jefferson, in every thing 
short of murder. Ah ! generous and accomplished Mer 
cer, how will your virtues hereafter receive my devotions, 
if you should think them polluted with these blasphemies 
against the admired relative of your adored ? But as my 
reflections are penned for no eye but that of my wife and 
two or three confidential friends, it will not be suspected 
by those who know my heart, that whatever share of 
further sufferings may result to me from the conduct of 
the Judge, can in the least generate my suspicions of his 
integrity, or warp my judgment of his behavior. Commins leaves this early to-morrow morning, for Balti 
more, where I expect to join him the day after to-mormorrow. I entertain strong hopes of being able to 
obtain some negroes in partnership with him. Burr did 
not come along with us from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, but will, we all 
believe, be through here in a day or two. I am enabled 
to say, from separate information I have obtained from 
Martin and Commins, he has made use of all the confidence he could inspire them with, to the utmost extent at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, where he has induced them to become his 
securities, in all the civil suits instituted there against him, 
to amount of $36,000. I have no doubt he has set every 
engine of his ingenuity at work to effect this object. The 
credulity and good nature of Martin, who worships even 
his vices, and is as assiduous in enlarging upon his looks 
and sayings as ever Bos well delighted in such drudgery 
for Johnson ; and the vanity of Commins, to purchase the 
interest of a man whose resources appear to his under 
standing inexhaustible ; both needed but little the col 
lateral security of Pollock, which, however, Burr has not 
only exhibited to them, but he has besides laid before 
them my expectations of succeeding to a large fortune 
in Europe ; thereby meaning to persuade them also, no 
doubt, that he will then control my finances ; although 
he had promised me he would not communicate my pros 
pects of the probability of that event to any one. Such 
is his honor ; such his unerring purpose to take every 
chance of converting even the hopes of his acquaintances 
to his own interest. On the whole, I should be well 
pleased with this last liberty he has taken with me, if it 
should hereafter make a part of that basis on which I 
shall endeavor to ground his effects to arrange my present 
pecuniary demands upon him. It is quite unaccountable 
how he has disposed of all the cash he raised in Kentucky 
last year. Jourdari has convinced me that he, Burr, actu 
ally received through his hands, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, not less 
than $40,000, of which he never advanced more than 
$15,000 to all his agents and associates, to say nothing of 
all the property he procured upon his drafts. He 
could since have spent but little money, having received 
much from the United States, and having been in custody 
until very lately. I shall, to-morrow, endeavor to investi 
gate the further views of Government upon me. 
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I have, this morning, written by Martin to Rodney, 
the United States Attorney-General, to request him to 
inform me, officially, whether Government is now dis 
posed to prosecute me any further, in conformity with 
the late adjudication of the Chief Justice, or will finally 
discharge me, as has been done, I hear, in the case of 
Tyler ; or will dispense with my personal appearance at 
Chillicothe until the September session of the Court 
there, as Government can not probably be prepared to 
prosecute at the next January term ; and, in the mean 
time, the occasions of my family, and the serious de 
mands of my private affairs, require my presence at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. I am very anxious to receive an answer before 
dinner, in which I much fear I shall not be gratified, 
through my friend M.'s more indispensable devotion to 
his libations. I shall, however, note the result, I hope, 
to-night. 

But I have been disappointed; for, though I spent a 
dollar in coach-hire to go with Martin, this evening, in 
quest of Rodney, we could not see him, as he was not 
returned from the President's, where he dined. Martin, 
I find, is very incontinent of every thing, which ordinary 
discretion should not disclose, where there is no injunction, in terms of secrecy. He assured me, to-day, he is 
prepared to sacrifice $10,000 for Burr, if the collateral 
security of Pollock should fail ; that it will be nothing 
more than diminishing a provision of so much he had 
made by will for his three daughters, which he had orig 
inally destined for a Miss Thompson, now Mrs. Livingston, to whom he gave an allowance of 600 a year, for 
six or seven years. But her husband is now richer than 
himself; "however, let the worst happen," he added, 
" he had signed blank bonds, which he left to be filled 
up by the attorneys employed against Burr ; " and such 
bonds, he says, are void by late decisions of the English 
Courts, adopted by the Courts here. This would seem 
inconsistent with the warm spirit of integrity which 
seems to breathe in all his thoughts and actions. And 
he declared accordingly, he would not take advantage 
of the circumstance. I also find his idolatrous admiration of Mrs. Alston is almost as .excessive as my own, 
but far more beneficial to his interest, and injurious to his 
judgment, as it is the medium of his blind attachment to 
her father, whose secrets and views past, present, or to 
come, he is, and wishes, to remain ignorant of. NOT 
can he see a speck in the character or conduct of Al 
ston, for the best of all reasons with him ; namely, that 
Alston has such a wife. 

This city has certainly no resemblance to any other 
upon earth. Its extent, as originally laid out, has been 
known for some years past, upon paper; but a few of 
its singular features, as they now smile or frown upon 
the Potomac, are remarkable. As to streets, literally 
speaking, there is not one yet in existence, unless the 
few wide paths and half-made roads that intersect each 
other can be called streets. On a hill, at the head of 
one of these, about a mile from the river, stand the two 
wings, without the body, of what is to constitute, but is 
already called, the Capitol. They are cumbrous, ill-pro 
portioned, piles of building to my eye ; with too small a 
space for the central building, if ever reared. About 
another mile's distance, to the westward, stands the Presi 
dent's house, with a low dead-wall in front, and an 
ordinary post-and-rail fence in the rear of it. On either 
side of it, stands what are called its wings, which any 
person would require to be told were such before he could 
believe it ; for they are of brick, and at too great a distance to appear to belong to the large White House between them any more than to the Capitol. They are each 
a row of ordinary brick houses ; in those to the West is 
kept the Post-office ; in those to the East, the Secretary 
of State's office is, etc. ; and both, it is said, are to be con 
nected with the center by a garden. But the last feature 
of architecture has not yet made its appearance. From 
the Capitol you behold, in four or five different directions, 
at the distance of from one to four miles apart, rows of 
houses, each of five or six together, so that the whole 
appears like a jumble of fragments of villages, except 
that part, being one and a half mile north-east of the 
Capitol, where the Navy-yard is said to stand, which is 
more built up than any other quarter of the city. But 
after all, every foreigner, after his arrival here, will in 
quire for fifty years to come, as is now very common, 
" where is the city of Washington ? " Martin visited Rob. 
Smith this evening, where he heard Wilkinson extolled, 
and Burr as heavily denounced, as if he had not yet been 
tried. Mr. and Mrs. Smith declared Government had 
abundant proofs against Burr, which they could not produce from confidential restrictions. Martin, before he 
left them, convinced himself they would gladly dispense 
with his visit.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I went this morning with Martin, in a carriage, to visit 
Rodney, before breakfast. R. is a trifling negative char 
acter, from whose manner I could at once perceive he had 
yesterday spoken with Jefferson of my arrival here. He 
abruptly told us, " Government meant certainly to proceed against us ; " on which he was received with a volley 
of abuse by Martin, who thanked his God for the news, 
as Government would thereby hasten the consummation 
of their own infamy. Rodney seemed surprised to learn 
from us that not a single witness had as yet been bound 
or summoned to appear in Ohio. I told him, as my call 
upon him was in his official character, I would leave him 
the letter I had yesterday written to him, which he prom 
ised he would, and did, answer this evening, by three or 
four lines, saying, " he could only observe, at present, that 
I would be bound to attend, pursuant to the recognizance 
I entered into at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. So he is also trained to 
teaze, if he can not injure, the infidels who worship not 
the divinity of Jefferson. Martin has solemnly pledged 
himself to meet Government, at the sitting of the Court 
in January, in Ohio ; to see things are conducted regu 
larly, so far as may concern Burr and me, whether we 
personally appear there or not. He has found out from 
Robert Smith, that Jefferson has no thoughts of war 
with Britain, of which he has so much affected the contrary ; for he will never act as he speaks or writes ; he 
will always counteract his political professions by his 
back-stairs committees, until Jack Randolph shall finally 
sever him from them. Burr, I hear, is arrived at Georgetown, three miles from hence, up the river. If so, he 
will probably be of our party to-morrow, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. 
"We set off at five in the morning, in the stage. Several 
northern members of Congress, whose names I know not, 
have had the curiosity or politeness to visit us. From 
one of them I was truly concerned to learn the death of 
Mr. Hunt, which happened last July, as he himself pre 
dicted, on his new purchase at French Grant, on the 
Ohio. This place has been extremely tiresome to me. 
The taverns are very dear, and badly kept; so that I shall 
leave it with pleasure. I wrote to-day to my landlord, 
"Walton, John Banks, and my wife, to gratify, as far as I 
could, all their cares and solicitude for my future desti 
nies. To all I acknowledged that tribute I so justly owe 
to Martin, who, with better breeding, and a redemption 
from his habits of inebriety, would be a perfect character. 
His heart is truly overflowing with the purest milk of 
benevolence. His potations may sometimes, perhaps, co 
agulate, but they will never acidify the fluid with which 
it is so well replenished. May it never be wasted on the 
unworthy. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, OCTOBER 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Rose before five this morning; but, as the coach then 
drove up with a cargo of eleven passengers, I have been 
detained here another day. I have borne the ennui, with 
which I have spent it, with such patience that I would 
not walk fifty yards from the tavern to visit the Hall of 
Congress, or observe how they ballot there for their 
officers or their committees ; though I certainly should 
have gone so far to hear a debate, had there been any. 
The election of officers reminds me of a curious Repub 
lican caper at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, last winter, which, as it was of 
a negative nature, can not be recorded in that State, but 
should be known every-where else, to convict it of im 
moral conduct, if not of impiety. It was nothing more 
than a " remembering to forget," on the part of the Legis 
lature, I mean the house of delegates, during the whole 
session, the immemorial custom to appoint a chaplain. 
Burr, I hear again, is somewhere in this city. But I no 
more depend upon his appearance than on that of a new 
comet. We start to-morrow again. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, NOVEMBER 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Before I mention my having arrived here, at last, I shall 
note the generosity of my barber at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, who reluctantly received three-quarters of a dollar from me, be 
cause I observed to him, " I should give him more than 
his charge, if I was not rather poor at present." And he 
evinced his sincerity by assuring me he had $100 at my 
service, which he requested me to accept. How is this to 
be accounted for? Devereux, Hendren, O'Hennessy, and 
Butler will all exclaim, " He was an Irishman ! " So he 
is : his name is Dixon, and it shall ever remain recorded 
in the duties of my gratitude. Yesterday, Martin and 
myself were wedged in among ten other passengers in the 
coach. A Mr. Blount, brother of the late Governor of 
Tennessee, was of the number. He is an infuriated Demo 
crat, was at the battle of Germantown, and ordered the 
aim of the riflemen who shot General Agnew in that 
affair. I saw Tyler on alighting from the coach, who 
showed me his discharge, in the handwriting of Rodney, 
whom he declares he has not seen, having received it 
from Captain Pike, who escorted him to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>. Tyler denies his having made any deposition 
against me any where, and professes his friendship and 
attachment to Burr, whom he is very anxious to see 
before he sets out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> with Sam. Swartwout. 
To-day I left my cards at Pringle's and the Gilmore's. 
Of these families, I only saw Mrs. Wm. Gilmore, who 
seemed glad to see me. I have a little curiosity to collect 
in my fallen fortune as many exceptions as I can establish 
to the general condemnation of mankind pronounced 
upon them by the adversity of individuals. I break 
fasted with Martin, and shall dine with him to-morrow, 
as well as all the Burrites in town. Burr, I hear, was, 
last night, at Georgetown. His appearance here is as 
much a matter of curiosity with his enemies as of interest with his friends. But the elements of his orbit, I 
repeat, are as unsettled as those of a new comet. Mar 
tin thinks he might have been detained to raise money 
enough to pay his tavern-bills, etc., while Commins says 
Burr assured him he should suffer no detention on that 
account. So it uniformly turns out, that no two persons 
of his acquaintance will ever understand him alike ; and 
yet all who still adhere to him profess a unity of confidence in him. Commins has brought on a fever by 
his debaucheries. I shall stay here at least till Wed 
nesday. 11, P. M.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, NOVEMBER 2, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I spent the principal part of the morning with Martin, 
reading the papers and conversing with various visitors 
he received. The news we deemed worthy of most notice 
"before dinner, was that of two arrivals in town, namely, 
Wilkinson's baggage, preparatory to his taking up his 
quarters at Fort McIIenry, near this city, and Burr's 
appearance at the French Hotel in Gay street. So the 
Brigadier, as I expected, will probably never revisit the 
Mississippi in his present command, nor probably long 
retain it here, notwithstanding all the control he may pos 
sess over the heart of Jefferson, and though he boasted, 
not long since, at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, that he would be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> 
in thirty days. Burr will probably show himself as little 
as possible to the public. He has, therefore, sneaked into 
obscure quarters, though Steward, who now manages this 
house since Evans's death, declared he would accommo 
date Col. Burr and his friends with as much attention in 
their adversity as he could have done in the days of their 
better fortune. The expression of this sentiment was 
drawn from him on the occasion of some illiberal Demo 
crats threatening to leave the house, if we were received 
into it. I dined with Martin, who had a select party, 
though he left out two Burrites, Tyler and Luckett. 
Burr called upon Martin, for a few moments, before din 
ner. He returned in the evening, and had a long conference with Tyler in an adjoining room ; during which the 
attention of our party in the dining-room was called forth 
to receive, at the windows, some public honors offered 
to us from the street. A desperate Democratic printer, 
commanding a company of one of the city regiments, 
whose name is Frely, drew up his men under the win 
dows, and there halted, while his fife and drum played 
the " Rogues' March " for us ; then gave three cheers, and 
marched off. This salutation has prepared fresh fuel to 
keep up the blaze of Martin's wrath against all his oppo 
nents. Burr, on his return with Tyler to us, said, " these 
excesses of indecency always recoil on those who enter 
into them ; " and he soon after withdrew, not evidently 
indifferent to such manifestations of public regards, 
which, however, I am sure, Martin will make his own 
use of with good effect against "Wright, the Governor of 
Maryland, whom Martin first brought into notice, which 
the Governor no longer remembers. I left soon after, that 
is, about 8, P. M., but did not go to bed till 11. At 10, 
I had a long conversation with Tyler, who, I find, has 
long since taken up all my impressions of Burr, and will 
spare no labor to infuse his opinions into the prejudices 
of Colonel Swartwout, whom, he has no doubt, he will 
induce to adopt his sentiments. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Having accidentally met Hayden, the dentist, this 
morning, who mentioned to me the late arrival, at the 
Academy, of a grand electrical machine, I could not sup 
press my wishes to see it. Hayden obligingly offered to 
walk there with me, which I accepted. He introduced 
me to the Principal of the Seminary, who received me 
very politely, and presented me to a Mr. Paguet, who 
took upon him the exhibition of the powers of the ma 
chine. This was a superb plate of forty-six French inches 
diameter, with a conductor, forming three sides of a par 
allelogram, one of them in front of, and parallel to, the 
plate ; the two others, perpendicular to it. The machine, 
with two turns of the plate, gave sparks twelve inches 
long, and charged a battery, about fifteen feet of coated 
glass, in ten turns, which killed a duck. On my return 
from the seminary, I repaired to L. Martin's, where one 
of his students informed me he expected a mob would 
this evening attack the house, and offer violence to Mr. 
Martin, Col. Burr and myself, of which notice had been 
given by hand-bills, which had been circulated through 
the town. Martin was not at home. I eagerly sought a 
view of one of the bills, which is in these words : 

" AWFUL ! ! ! 

" The public are hereby notified that four < choice spir 
its ' are this afternoon, at 3 o'clock, to be marshaled for 
execution by the hangman, on Gallows Hill, in consequence of the sentence pronounced against them by the 
unanimous voice of every honest man in the community. 
The respective crimes for which they suffer are thus 
stated on the record : first, Chief Justice M. for a repetition of his X. Y. Z. tricks, which are said to be much 
aggravated by his felonins capers in open Court, on the 
plea of irrelevancy ; secondly, His Quid Majesty, charged 
with the trifling fault of wishing to divide the Union, 

and farm Baron Bastrop's grant ; thirdly, B , the 

chemist, convicted of conspiring to destroy the tone of 
the public Fiddle ; fourthly, and lastly, but not least, 
Lawyer Brandy-Bottle, for a false, scandalous, malicious 
Prophecy, that, before six months, * Aaron Burr would 
divide the Union.' N". B. The execution of accomplices 
is postponed to a future day." 

My first inquiries of the few acquaintances I met in the 
streets, who now know me, were directed by a desire to 
acquire some estimate of what we might expect in the 
evening ; but I obtained little satisfaction. I then thought 
Burr might be best informed, as his vigilance I had be 
fore proved to be lively at all times, was most sharp on 
the approach of danger. I know not whether Tyler had 
smelt out what was brewing before I had heard any thing 
about it, but found, on my return from the seminary, be 
fore I had heard the news, he had fled rather precipi 
tately ; for he had declared to me, not two hours before I 
last went to seek him, that he should not go away until 
to-morrow. I therefore bent my course straight to Burr, 
at his shabby quarters, in Gay Street, where I waited full 
fifteen minutes before I could see him. I afterward found 
he was packing up his things to escape in the mail, which 
was to leave in ten minutes. He labored hard within, I 
could plainly see, to exhibit that composure of manner, to 
which he has devoted so much of his life, to form his 
exterior by. He would not wait to write the superscription of a letter, which he requested me to direct for him 
to David M. Randolph. I bid him adieu, with an assurance that I would follow him to-morrow, and he said I 

should find him at G , in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. On my return 

to Evans's, I found Martin, Luckett and Commins in my 
bed-room. Martin defied the menaces of the mob, but 
he assured me he had just left the mayor, who had prom 
ised him to make all necessary arrangements to secure 
the peace of the city, and protect every one from personal injury. 

Luckett having come by a different way from that I 
took, though I was walking the streets in every direction 
all the morning, told me Burr and Swartwout had been 
/ 

escorted by a guard sent them by the mayor, from their 
lodgings to the stage-office, from whence he had seen 
them start, under the good wishes of many spectators. 
Commins denounced the Government and it's rabble, and 
said, it was impossible any thing should- be attempted 
against us ; but I thought otherwise. I deliberated a little on the various reports I had heard, however different 
in particulars, yet all agreeing that Martin and myself 
should at least receive an addition to our wardrobe, of a 
suit of tar and feathers. I thought it would not be im 
proper to leave town, or at least change my lodgings 
forthwith. But I soon reflected, how naturally Burr 
might expect to receive unwelcome obloquy for his flight, 
and I at once determined to keep my ground. At din 
ner, therefore, I took my seat, amidst a very large com 
pany, at the long table, and remained there conversing a 
long time with a Frenchman, who sat next me, at least 
half an hour after 3 o'clock, the time designated in the 
hand-bills for the spectacle that was to take place in the 
evening. I should have sat, I know not how much 
longer, had not Steward, who manages the house, brought 
a man up to me, who inquired my name. On giving it 
to him, he said he belonged to the police of the city, and 
had been sent, with several others of that body, to watch, 
and give notice of any attempt upon the public peace, or 
on the persons of individuals. "That the mayor had 
particularly mentioned me to him by name," which I be 
lieved, as he said Mr. Thoroughgood Smith observed to 
him, " he had formerly known me and my lady here." I 
took this man out ; his name is Goldsmith. I then 
ordered liquor for him and his companions in another 
room, where I. thanked them for the service they, in the 
way of their duty, were come to render me. They 
informed nte, two troops of horse were ordered out, 
and I had nothing to fear. The time passed away in 
conversation with these men, about twelve in number, 
until near 5 o'clock, when I sent Goldsmith to request 
Martin to come to me, as I wished to share his fate, having understood from them that I ought not to go out 
of the house, which I interpreted into something like 
a wish on the part of the mayor. Soon after I returned 
to my room to write, Goldsmith came to me with intel 
ligence that Martin could not be seen at his house ; that 
his students and some friends were armed, and well 
prepared to repel an expected assault on the house ; " but 
that the people were in motion in great force, had every 
thing prepared for tarring and feathering," and would, 
he believed, if disappointed or opposed, tear Martin and 
myself to pieces. He then begged of me not to leave the 
room I was in, adding, " that his companions would 
drown him, if they could, in a basin of water, for his 
attention to me, though he was as good a Republican as 
any of them." I now suspected this man might possibly 
direct the drunken desperadoes of an enraged multitude 
to my apartment. I therefore determined to change it 
for another the moment he left me. In a few minutes, 
Steward came up stairs, and told me to go into the gar 
ret, which I soon did, under an apprehension that I was 
betrayed or sought after. In the garret, I observed two 
trap-doors opening through the roof of the house, on 
which I resolved to take my station, from whence I 
might contemplate at my leisure, if I could not distinctly 
see the scenes that might shortly pass in the streets 
below. Both the trap-doors were open. I shut down 
one of them, and intended to cut off my return into the 
nouse by shutting the other, should it become necessary* 
But an uproar soon rose to my ears from below, and 
from one of the garret windows I saw the mob pass by 
the house, to the amount of about fifteen hundred, as 
well as I could estimate, in full huzza, with fife and drum 
playing the " Rogue's march." I have since learned, they 
drew along with them, in two carts, the representatives, 
habited for execution, of the Chief Justice, Burr, Martin 
and myself. They passed on to Martin's house, in 
Charles-street, where they broke some of his windows, 
and performed some other feats, of which I have not yet 
learned the particulars. In the mean time, two troops of 
cavalry patrolled the streets, not to disperse the mob, but 
to follow and behold their conduct. They, the mob, 
made as much noise as if they were about to destroy the 
city, and returned about 7 o'clock to the point from 
whence they came, headed, I hear, by one Patterson, who 
lives there ; while the cavalry have, I suppose, been long 
since dismissed, in full confidence in the honor of the 
mobility. I have been down stairs to supper at the long 
table. It is now near 10 o'clock, and I have not these 
two hours heard any more of either of them. How far 
the respectable part of the city will think it worth their 
while to show they had no participation in this frolic, 
which, I am informed, was chiefly made up at the " point," 
we shall hereafter learn. I believe it altogether orig 
inated with the Democratic printers here, who are but 

little controlled by one spiritless Federal paper, which is 
31 
all there is at present on that side ; while there are three 
or more Federal prints supported in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where 
I have no expectation of receiving similar public honors 
to those conferred upon me here. Wrote to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, to 
counteract, by anticipation, the alarms my friends there 
might take up for my safety, from the rapid circulation 
of rumors, etc. 

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Went early this morning to Martin's, where I saw Mr. 
Ray, a warm friend to him, who had taken, last night, 
the direction of the gentlemen who had volunteered to 
defend the house. Martin and his property, I found, were 
untouched last night, the mob having contented them 
selves with menaces and abuse, offering a defiance to the 
party within and the cavalry without, from whence I 
conclude that the mayor was intimidated by them and a 
large majority of the two troops of horse, well disposed 
to their views or their leaders ; namely, one Biayo, and 
others from the " point." Martin did not appear to his 
friends until this morning. I took leave of him on my 
way to the packet, by which I set out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, 
where I arrived, with no occurrence during the journey, 
on Thursday, 5th of November, at 3 o'clock, P. M. Put 
up at the Mansion House, late Bingham's, kept by an 
Englishman, in the best style I ever saw in America. 
Dined, dressed, and visited Burr and my worthy friends, 
Mr. and Mrs. Jos. Lewis. Burr pretended he should 
have waited, if he had not believed every thing at Balti 
more would have ended with the hand-bills. He was 
very glad to hear of Martin's having so well escaped, and 
said lie would give Bollman, who boarded where I did, a 
letter of introduction to me. I observed to him, that 
probably Dr. Bollman did not wish my acquaintance, as 
he had never called upon me in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. Burr tried 
to excuse this, but failed. He is trying to live here 
incog., but every one knows he is in town. I supped 
with Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, en famiUe, where my friendly 
reception, kind inquiries, and the interesting conversation of my amiable friends, agreeably detained me until 
midnight, when I took leave, with a promise to dine 
with them to-morrow. 

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Spent the morning chiefly in examining the newspapers 

and visits to the Lewises, Conrad, C h and Turnbull's 

families, as my friend Joe Lewis's dinner-hour is 2 o'clock. 
Before I went there, I had a call from R. Lewis, to bring 
me a letter from Walton, of no importance, and engage 
me to dinner with him to-morrow. Passed the evening 
sociably, tete-a-tte, with Joe L. ; during which I was 
chiefly occupied in conversation with him on the subject 
of Burr's trials and adventures, and also that of my present financial derangements. About 7, P. M., we were 
called into the street by an alarm of fire, which turned 
out to be groundless ; and I saw him back to his house, 
where I then left him, to return to my lodgings, as I had 
a severe headache. Before I went to bed, I observed that 
the " American," a Democratic paper of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, contained an invidious paragraph approving of the insults 
offered to us there last Tuesday evening. Bollman has left 
his card with me, with a letter of introduction from Burr. 
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

At breakfast, this morning, Bollman presented himself 
to me upon his credentials, and I received him into my acquaintance with all the ease of courtly etiquette I am master of. I invited him to take a seat by me, and entered 
into conversation with him on general topics, which was 
sustained for half an hour, and succeeded by his obliging 
me with his view of the Mississippi country, and particularly the environs of New Orleans, for which he entertained a decided preference to any other quarter, and pro 
jects, probably without the command of a dollar, nothing 
less than the purchase of an estate, at $60,000, within five 
miles of that city. Daniel Clark has assured him it is a 
great bargain, as it will yield a revenue of $15,000 a year 
by adding a few slaves to those already on it ; and Boll 
man only wants a friend or two to join with $10,000 each, 
and he can effect the rest. I have little doubt Bollman 
has conceived I may be of use to him in this affair ; but 
I am certain he can not serve me in it. Mrs. David Ran 
dolph had no small trial of her skill in detecting this 
man's character, if her judgment has not erred in the 
attempt; for his countenance, manner and address possess 
every qualification to engage the warmest interest in his 
favor as a scholar, a gentleman, or perhaps a gallant. Yet 
he has formerly failed in this town as a merchant, rather 
through his excesses in speculation and intrigue than from 
any natural inaptitude to that sort of life. And his late 
wife's family discovered enough in him to determine them 
to oppose his connection with the N. family as far as was 
possible. But I will, at present let him rest. I dined 
and spent the early part of the evening with R. Lewis, in 
the same way I did yesterday with his brother, that is, 
in the enjoyment of good wines and friendly conversation. 
I must, however, partake of no more of these early din 
ners, as the long sittings that succeed them leave no time, 
these short days, to transact whatever business may yet 
detain me here. Duane has announced the arrival of 
Admiral Blennerhassett, at the Mansion House, and republished, from the " <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> Whig," its invitation to 
invest us with a suit of " Yankee ermine," as well as the 
process-verbal of the mobility of that city. But I shall 
visit this apostle of Democracy on Monday. 

SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Visited, this morning, by Tom. Butler, who made me 
very happy, by learning from him my beloved wife had 
quite recovered from her fever, and she and the boys were 
well after the middle of last September, when he saw them. 
While I was attending the service at the Roman Catholic 
chapel in Fourth Street, I had the honor of morning vis 
its from sundry great personages, who left their cards for 
me ; namely, Burr, Bollman and George Pollock, reputed 
to be very rich, whose education, I have heard, Burr has 
had some concern with, and at whose house here he has 
taken up his quarters. After my return from Mass, I was 
visited by a Mr. Reckless, of New Jersey, who seems a 
warm partisan of Burr, and is engaged in endeavoring to 
do away an indictment, pending in that State against 
Burr, for the killing of General Hamilton. Upon the re 
moval of this impediment, I find Burr means to try the 
effect of requisitions upon a considerable party he considers attached to him in that quarter. Mr. R. treated me with 
much consideration, and said, " while I was abroad, some 
members of the Jersey Legislature had come with him to 
wait upon me." I find, indeed, the greater part of the 
numerous strangers who frequent the Mansion House re 
gard me with no common attention. I form acquaintances 
among them without previous introductions ; but this is 
more to be attributed to the sinking of Democracy here 
into the coalition of the Federals and Quids, which has 
nearly annihilated the faction of Duane, than to any 
claim I could have upon public favor from the merit of 
my acts or the singularity of my fortune. I have, among 
others, met here with a Mr. B., from Charleston, South 
Carolina, who has traveled much, and has embellished 
good talents with much accomplishments. 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Conversed for half an hour, after breakfast, with Bollman, chiefly upon medical and physiological subjects, in 
which I was much pleased with some novelty of fancy 
recommended by that suavity of manner and easy address 
which endanger the judgment of those who listen to him. 
I had invitations from Pollock and Joe Lewis for dinner to-morrow. Dined with Turnbull, spent part of the 
evening with Tom. Butler, and supped with Joe Lewis en 
famille, where I sat until midnight. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Soon after breakfast, visited Burr and Pollock. Burr 
has again opened an audience-chamber, which is much 
occupied. Although I found two or three friends with 
him at breakfast, he was called out the moment he had 
finished, and was absent about an hour and three-quar 
ters, during which interval Mr. Pollock gave me his 
company. I find him a very well-bred man, who has had 
advantages in Europe. He spoke less of Mrs. Alston than 
I expected, and has never seen her husband, whose various talents, however, he does not the less correctly esti 
mate. "With respect to Burr, whatever may have been 
the ground of his present intimacy with Mr. P., I can venture to affirm, it has already been abused on the part of 
the former, although the latter, as yet, is evidently un 
aware of it. Pollock withdrew, and I entered upon the 
objects of my visit. After informing Burr that Martin was 
resolved to appear for us at Chillicothe, he seemed all sur 
prise ; and nothing could be more natural than the collision of such generosity with his own ingratitude ; for he 
fled from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, without waiting even to thank his 
friend for the long and various services he had rendered 
him. Further, he had not written to him from hence. 
On recovering from this new charge of Martin's benevo 
lence upon his feelings, he exclaimed, " What a man ! " 
but told me I must write to him not to think of the jour 
ney till he should hear from him ; that I should direct 
him, in the. mean time, to write to Burnet and Michael 
Baldwin, the late Marshal of Ohio, to retain both (no 
doubt, with Martin's advance of their fees), and that he 
still had no thoughts of going to Ohio, though he had 
given notice to Scott, the Virginia Marshal, to be prepared 
with a guard of gentlemen, by the tenth of December, at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, to conduct him from thence to Chillicothe. 
He added, " that Martin's too great zeal and indiscretion 
would do us great mischief in Ohio, and the skill of Burnet, with the influence of Baldwin, who was popular with 
the blackguards, and exasperated against the Administration since the loss of his office, were the best means to 
frustrate the efforts of Government to have bills found 
against us, which they would exert themselves to effect, 
to divert his, Martin's, attention from other objects." He 
now again assured me he would be glad I could extricat^ myself from the Government upon any terms agree 
able to my own feelings, and fully approved of my effecting that object through Duane, in any way my judgment 
might suggest. This business being thus dispatched, I 
next solicited him on the subject of his finances, on which 
indeed he had partly anticipated me, by inquiring, " what 
were my prospects through my friends, the Lewises?" 
I informed him I had no expectations from that quarter, 
and should absolutely starve, while I was possessed of 
such splendid hopes in Europe, if I was not relieved in 
the mean time. He regretted much the absence from 
town of two persons with whom he expected to do some 
thing ; but he had, he said, negotiations on foot, the success of which he could not answer for, but should know 
in two or three days. I now represented to him the 
probable necessity I could not resist, of urging Alston, 
but hoped such a measure would not be displeasing to 
him or to Mrs. Alston, Upon this suggestion, he was 
less reserved than he had been with me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
before he was acquainted with my pecuniary views and 
my means of advancing him in Europe, and freely de 
clared neither Mrs. Alston nor himself would be dis 
pleased with any steps I might take against Alston, who 
had treated him in a manner I could well enough judge of, 
to save him the mortification of expressing his opinion of 
it. He even assured rne he had demanded from Alston 
an explanation of his conduct in addressing the letter to 
Pinckney, immediately on his arrival in custody at Rich 
mond, observing, " that no humiliation of his condition 
could make him forget what he owed to his own dignity ; " that Alston had shown much contrition, and 
made every possible concession, including an offer of 
a public reconciliation in print ; but Burr said he thought 
it would be prudent to spare him this extreme of humili 
ation, I suppose, for his daughter's sake. By the by, it 
is remarkable that many persons of penetration and in 
telligence, who have indulged an eager interest in investi 
gating every thing during the last year relating to Burr, 
within the reach of their inquiries, should have pretermitted that irredeemable passage of Alston's letter, im 
puting to Burr a design to bereave his infant grandson 
of his patrimony. Before Burr returned from the audience chamber, I found Mr. Pollock had made a like omission ; and, upon my acquainting him with the circum 
stance, he expressed his feelings suitably of the con 
founded folly and turpitude of the writer, who had long 
before repeated to me assurances he had given his fatherin-law, that his property was worth one hundred thou 
sand guineas, and he would, if necessary, embark the 
whole of it in the furtherance of Col. Burr's plans. I 
did not leave Burr until he had again reminded me of his 
hopes of my forwarding his views in England ; to which 
I answered, " I could only lend my endeavors to serve 
him by the letters I had already offered him." He said, 
it was to those only he alluded ; so the baits I have 
thrown out to him do not yet glitter in vain, which further, 
appeared, by his observing to the party present, when 
first I called upon him, " that he supposed I had not yet 
taken the trouble to find out whether a certain man was 
dead or alive, upon whose death I should be entitled to a 
fortune worth, at least, one hundred thousand guineas," 
adding, " I had a strange fund of indifference to objects 
few other men could resist." This was truly well thrown 
out for Pollock, etc. But I was not a little amused to 
observe he had been calculating how many years' pur 
chase my expected estates of 6,000 a year would sell 
for ; so that while this bait glitters he will not lightly 
break from me. Dined and spent the evening with a set 
party at Joe Lewis's. I have found it due to so worthy 
a friend, to offer him a perusal of these notes, as I hope 
they will more fully develop to him my character and 
necessities than he could otherwise become acquainted 
with either; and I took to his aid -and counsel, rather 
than to any other present means, to lighten the actual 
burdens that bear so heavily upon my family. He has 
perused the first volume with so much interest and satis 
faction that he has given it a second reading. This alone 
would be an ample compensation for the little labor I 
have spent upon it. I feel I have penned many reflections, and passed many characters with my own, in review, 
in a light which should be admitted to few eyes besides 
those of my wife. But I fully rely upon the safe keeping 
of the confidence I have ventured with my friend, who 
will therefore be enabled to take a better view of my suf 
ferings and necessities. I have lost some time in visiting 
Duane, which 1 shall not effect before Thursday. There 
are two excellent papers here lately set up against him; 
namely, the "Spirit of the Press" and the "Tickler," 
which would he perfect, if they were not too local. 

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Soon after breakfast, I was called, by note, to Lewis's 
counting-house, to meet Bartlett, the partner of Tom 
Hart, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, who kept me waiting there for him 
the best part of the morning ; but, at last, arrived, and 
paid me $832, being so much saved out of my losses by 
Hart, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. Dined with a formal party at my friend 
R. Lewis's, where I sat with a pleasant set, after dinner, 
until 11 o'clock, and received an invitation to dinner from 
Mr. Tightman, an amiable and convivial young merchant 
of this city, and son of the Judge of that name. Reeve 
let freely loose the flow of soul and of w T ine. He is an 
excellent mimic, and a truly comic character, and might, 
if he had not a far better calling, excel upon the stage. 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Occupied this morning, chiefly, by reading the papers, 
particularly a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> Courier, containing an excellent 
speech of Sheridan's, or rather only a skeleton of it, on 
Irish affairs. This paper Mr. Bee was kind enough to 
procure for me, without solicitation on my part. Until 
dinner time, I passed the remainder of the morning in 
walking and buying a few articles for my wife. Burr 
has taken an excursion of about twenty miles up the 
Delaware, to return, I expect; on Saturday, when I pro 
pose, in the event of his being still out of cash, to make 
my last demand upon him so long projected ; namely, a 
requisition to him to procure security, to which my family 
can resort, in this country, for my claims upon him, to 
the amount of about $9,000, made up by my account 
already presented to him, and the debt and charges arising from Miller's demand. The mercantile folks are 
much alarmed with the news of to-day, threatening a 
speedy war with Britain. And I have heard it said, that 
shares in some of the Insurance Stocks have fallen to-day 
ten per cent. But I observe the successful energies of 
my native country against Copenhagen have a petrifying 
effect upon the Democrats, while nineteen-twentieths of 
the merchants, who are Federalists, awfully contemplate 
the approaching crisis with England. This evening, I 
received a novel remedy for a sharp toothache, with 
which I was affected. It was grounded on a principle, 
that great mental engagement and exertion would operate 
a diversion of inordinate action expended upon a small 
diseased portion of the body. I attempted to put this 
fancy to the test, by effecting my too long-neglected in 
terview with Duane. After tea, I set out upon this 
adventure, and arrived at his dwelling in much pain, 
about 8, P. M. I think it deserves notice that I shouldmention, because my feelings were singularly affected by 
the preparation I found I had to undergo, to obtain not 
only an audience of this high priest of Jacobinism, but 
even admission within the walls that contained his Holiness. I had pulled the bell three times, without producing the common effect of bringing any one to the door 
from within, and was in the act of applying my hand to 
a fourth experiment, when a man answered from with
out, an Irishman. He inquired my name, in a full Cork 
accent, but very low voice, and on hearing it, said Mr. 
Duane was not at home, but if I would leave my name 
and business he would mention it to him. I said, I 
should suppose my name was now become familiar 
enough with every one in the employment of Mr. Duane 
to render my leaving it in writing unnecessary. The 
printer's devil replied, " to be sure, every one knew Mr. 
Hassett, and Mr. Duane would be glad to see him." 
While this conversation was passing, Duane, who had 
been listening in the alley adjoining the house, came for 
ward without his hat ; for he had passed from the rear 
of the house into the alley, to spy secretly the chances of 
safety, as he could ascertain them by observing what he 
could see or hear, between his scout and me. The Colonel 
has been further seasoned to the service of his party, of 
which he now begins to feel a little tired, by two drub 
bings, since his return from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> ; and as he rises 
in military rank, and suffers in service, he grows more 
wary in caution, and has learned from experience the 
folly of exposing his person by night, without full assurance of the peaceful intentions of his visitor. All scru 
ples of this sort being removed upon the present occasion, 
I apologized for the unusual hour I had fallen upon for 
my visit, which had seemingly broken in upon the Col 
onel while he was engaged with business or company, as 
he had been denied to me, though I was fortunate enough 
to find him at home. To this I received some blundering 
answer; the scout withdrew, and I was invited into the 
house, where I was introduced to Mrs. Duane. 

In a few minutes I signified a desire to speak with the 
Colonel in private. Upon this suggestion he took up a 
candle, and I followed him up stairs. I opened the inter 
view by informing him that I could not leave town without calling to thank him for the visit and friendly offers 
I had received from him during my imprisonment in 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> ; that I felt disposed to regard his motives to 
that visit as distinct from considerations of party or poli 
tics, the mere dictates of national feelings, and the natural impulse of an Irishman to serve a suffering country 
man in distress ; that, besides this motive to my visit, I 
felt much curiosity, and some personal interest, to learn 
how far he approved of the determination of Government 
to pursue me with further and indefinite prosecutions, 
which could add nothing in their result to the public 
interest or the credit of the Administration, however they 
might diminish or ruin my fortune ; that, although it 
might be deemed politic to keep Col. Burr busy by such 
vexations, Government could apprehend nothing from 
me, and at all events I was sure he could not approve of 
the vindictive spirit that had even refused to dispense 
with my personal appearance at Chillicothe, next January, when Government can not be prepared to go to trial, 
much less shall I ; then, reminding him of the offers he 
had made me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I said, my situation at present 
was very different, as it regarded my connection with 
Col. Burr, from what it was at that time ; for I, now re 
garded myself as cleared from all charges that the Gov 
ernment had failed to establish against me, and no longer 
felt it incumbent upon me to undergo endless prosecutions to vindicate whatever concern I had in Col. Burr's 
speculations, especially as he probably will never renew 



WITH DUANE.| 495 

them ; and if he could, I should have no further concern 
in them. 

I had no need to sound any deeper in the shallow wa 
ters of my research, which by no means possess that 
depth that is commonly supposed. Burr had advised me 
that this man loved wonderfully to hear himself talk, 
and that the best way was to let him run on until he 
was out of breath, and afterward take him back to those 
points on which he had stumbled, and on which I wished 
to fasten his attention. The hint was serviceable, and I 
made more use of it than I might have done if I had de 
pended upon the reserve Duane affected on his visit to me 
in the Penitentiary, which I now see arose from a dis 
covery he soon made on that occasion, that he durst not 
broach the unhallowed purpose for which he then visited 
me, which was a bargain to induce me to betray my en 
gagements or connections ; while, on the present occa 
sion, he considered me rather as a politician assailing his 
interest underhand, than a suitor soliciting his good 
offices. I concluded my observations with stating that I 
understood Colonel Burr meant again to surrender him 
self into the custody of the Marshal of Virginia, with 
intent to be conveyed from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, about the tenth of 
next month, to Chillicothe, at the public expense, and if I 
should not soon discover that Government would decline 
further proceedings against me, I should immediately 
prepare to commence the expenditure of so much of the 
public money as the law would allow me toward the 
charges of my defense, which had not hitherto cost the 
United States a dollar. But I wished him to be assured 
it was not my purpose to ask any favors from Government at any time, or through any quarters whatever, my 
chief object in making him this present visit being to 
learn, as far as I could through him, whether the Admin 
istration still preserved a spirit of hostility to me person 
ally? He now launched out into abuse of Burr and 
Marshall, and said, the Government were committed with 
the sentiments of the majority of the people, who would 
never be satisfied without our conviction on such full evidence as had come out, particularly that of Wilkinson, 
Dunbaugh and the Hendersons ; that it would look like 
persecution of Burr, to grant me any forbearance, and 
that the Chief Justice must atone for his conduct to the 
country. Luther Martin, he declared, had lately done 
Burr more harm than his enemies could have wished in 
the public sentiment, by his silly and intemperate publi 
cations. Wilkinson, he acknowledged, was as much con 
cerned in Burr's schemes as Burr himself; but his excul 
pation was not only due to him, from his seasonable 
discovery and overthrow of the plot, but his country 
should canonize him for it, and the Government could 
never sufficiently requite him. He declared he, Duane, 
had a regular correspondence with Hay, who, he would 
not believe, had ever censured or neglected to vindicate 
the General. I expressed my surprise at his entertaining 
such sentiments seriously, however he might advance 
them in his paper ; but he was frank enough to protest 
to me that he considered Gallatin* now the most dangerous man in the country ; Randolph was mad; Burr might 
still play the part of Coriolanus or Alcibiades ; but Jeffer
* Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury.

son and Madison were the only men on whom the coun 
try could depend, though he had no doubt Monroe would 
have been President, had it not been for the interference 
of Randolph, which had ruined his prospects. As for him 
self, he had been proposed as senator, during his attendance at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, without his knowledge, which was the 
reason he had lost his election. Mr. Erskine's dispatches, 
which had been used as a trap to ensnare him, only contained some newspaper S) and he had defeated the scheme 
by forwarding them after the mail. It appears plainly 
from this sketch, that we have authority for knowing the 
present party in power are divided among themselves ; 
that the Chief of the nation is still afraid of Burr, which 
is further proved by his own indiscretion ; for Jefferson 
has lately said, that whenever Burr could get to the 
Netherlands, he could command $400,000. Yet Duane 
continues his daily attacks upon Burrism, and complains 
a good deal of Burr being in town, though his bothered 
runners can not find out where he lives. Before I left 
him, he affected to disapprove of the late rising in Balti 
more, no doubt, because he can't excite the good people 
of this town to another here. He seemed surprised to 
learn I had the hardihood to dine and sup in public, on 
the day my eflagy was executed ; and when I told him I 
was always provided with a brace of pistols, he twirled 
on his seat. Having given him this impression for the 
benefit of himself and his friends, I left him, in perfect 
freedom from my toothache. I returned to the Mansion 
House, where I passed the remainder of the evening in 

miscellaneous conversation with several agreeable men.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I have nothing material to note to-day, except my dining and spending the evening with Mr. Edward T , 

whose hospitality but too successfully seduces the prudence of his guests. 

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Took a family dinner, to-day, with Jos. Lewis, who had 
yesterday appointed to take me, this evening, to see a fine 
grazing farm, about six miles from town, belonging to a 
man of the name of Sickle, at the confluence of the Dela 
ware and Schuylkill. We set out in Lewis's carriage, in 
company with a Mr. Hamilton, a very amiable English 
man, who formerly belonged to the Navy, is curious in 
paintings, of which he has a handsome collection that I 
have not yet seen, and keeps a small and well-regulated 
academy with much credit. We reached the place early 
enough to see it and the fine cattle belonging to it, together with a remarkably beautiful heifer, at a neighboring plantation of Sickle's, on our way homeward. This 
heifer, about three years old, besides her fine make, would 
weigh, it is said, fifteen hundred pounds. The farm was 
remarkable for its banks, faced with stone, and luxuriant 
pastures, of which, however, a great deal is wasted for 
want of better care, notwithstanding the crops of hay 
taken off" every spring and summer. 

SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

I am much mortified by my detention here, through the 
probably delusive hopes Burr has held out to me of the 
probable success of his efforts to raise money. I have 
almost let slip the season for descending the Ohio, for 
there is much appearance of an early winter ; and thus 
will another item be probably added to the long account 
of my sufferings by this man. 

Wrote to my wife ; read and dined at home with a com 
pany of about thirty, among whom were counted individ 
uals of thirteen different nations, and General Moreau, 
who sets out, to-morrow, for New Orleans, with a single 
companion, in the stage, by the way of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>. The 
General spoke to nobody; but his companion, Bollman, 
assures me he is a man of little speech and no ideas, 
except on military affairs ; so that I had no loss in dining 
with a conversable party at a distant part of the table. 
Wrote this evening to Luther Martin and Doctor Commins, to put the former off his design of going to Chillicothe for Burr and myself, and to remind the latter of my 
intention to travel with him, and have a concern in his 
negro purchases. 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Bollman, to-day, handed me a printed estimate of the 
value and yearly profits of sugar estates in the Orleans 
territory, furnished him by Daniel Clark, now here, who 
will decline visiting me, I apprehend, until I shall have 
extinguished the last spark of Burrism within me, with 
which, I suspect, he has been sufficiently singed to dread 
the fire. Spent the best part of the morning shopping, 
after some conversation with Bollman, who further rec 
ommends himself by a disclosure of his family affairs and 
narrow circumstances, unsought altogether on my part. 



500 THE BLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The result of Clark's statement is a yearly return, in 
Acadia county, of twenty-eight per cent, on the capital 
invested, and twenty-two in the vicinity of Orleans, which 
is represented superior to any thing farming can produce 
any where else, hecause no more, in fact, than one-third 
of the capital is advanced for the first installment, the 
produce of the estate clearing itself in four years. But, 
though examples are given of what has been done by two 
or three planters for as many successive years in the vicinity of Orleans, the counties of Acadia and La Fourche, as 
yet, do not furnish experience of what might be expected 
in those situations, and the best management and no acci 
dents are presumed. 

Supped this evening with Joe Lewis, and on my return 
home was blest with a letter from my beloved wife, which 
I found on my bedroom table, and probably was for 
warded, under cover from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, to Burr, as it had 
no postmark, and did not reach me through Lewis. This 
letter is of 28th of September, at which time all was well 
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Had a note from Burr, this morning, to dine with 
him to-morrow at 4 o'clock, which invitation I have 
accepted, in anticipation of mixing, probably for the last 
time, with a few of his choice spirits. Spent the evening 
and supped, en famille, agreeably with Joe Lewis. There 
is a great fall of snow since yesterday. R. Lewis has 
solicited to see my notes, which I could not refuse. He 
pledged his discretion, in which I fully confide. 



DAVIESS S PAMPHLET.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

So much of these short mornings is consumed with 
visits, the papers, and the unavoidable waste of time 
that can not be denied to acquaintances only, that little 
business can be dispatched by me before dinner, when 
that call must be answered at 2, or even 3, o'clock. 
To-day, however, I did a little shopping before I came 
home to dress for Burr's party, which I joined at halfpast four, consisting only of Mr. Biddel, one of his most 
attached friends, and brother to the notary public here, 
Dav. Randolph, Tom. Butler, Doctor Commins, Mr. Pol 
lock, Burr and myself. The party was as insipid as pos 
sible. Burr is evidently dejected; and though he often 
affected to urge and enliven the conversation, it lan 
guished through the stupidity of Randolph, the uncon 
cern of Pollock, the vacant reserve of Commins, the in 
capacity of Butler, the nothingness of Biddel, and the 
aversion of myself to keep it up, until 8 o'clock, when 
it expired ; and I took leave soon after the entrance of a 
General Nichol, who seemed another of Burr's gaping 
admirers, and much resembles, in manner, breeding and 
intellect, General Rupel, of Kentucky. Thus ended the 
last invitation I shall ever probably receive from this 
American Chesterfield, who is fast approaching the limits 
of that career he has so long run, through the absurd 
confidence of so many dupes and swindlers. I had yesterday put into my hands, for the first time, by David 
Randolph, Joe Daviess's pamphlet. It is a hasty, pas 
sionate performance, seldom alluding particularly to me 
by name, but bearing hard upon Jefferson's hypocrisy 
and neglect of the author, and the early information he 
gave him of Burr's designs and first movements. The 
book will, with all its defects, mortify Jefferson, by proving to the world that he would at no time open his eyes 
or ears to Wilkinson's intrigues with the Spanish Government, and, therefore, to use an expression of the author, 
" the President is as much espanishized as the Brigadier." 
It has also great merit in its comments, and the parody it 
contains on Jefferson's communication of last January to 
Congress, on Burr's operations last winter on the Ohio and 
Mississippi, which has very much diverted me. This per 
formance, together with Judge Marshall's last volume of 
the Life of Washington, exposing the origin and views of 
the present Democratic party in power, have, by this time, 
I have no doubt, inspired Jefferson with a more deadly 
hatred of the Marshall faction than he has ever conceived of all the Burrites he ever heard of. I was present 
ed, to-day, by a Mr. Nolta, a young Italian, who has often 
met Wilkinson at parties in New Orleans, with a caricature 
of that General & la Falstaff. It is a good resemblance, 
and pleased me, though it is not thought as well done as 
another he has made of Edw. Livingston, as a companion 
to the first, under the title of Lawyer Greyhound. I have 
paid my second week's bill here, amounting, in the whole, 
to about thirty dollars ; and for this, though I do not dine 
at home half my time, I can not have a fire in my room. 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Visited, this morning, the infant Academy of the Arts, 
lately established here, with Joseph Lewis, who is a sub 
scriber to the Institution, and showed me the way from 
his counting-house, where I pass half an hour every 
morning. The present collection, in a well contrived 
building, at the upper end of Chestnut Street, is slender 
in paintings ; all of which, however, I did not stay long 
enough to examine. Two fine large ones, by West, of 
scenes from Lear and Hamlet, are lent for exhibition 
by their owner Mr. Fulton ; and there are few other orig 
inals of much value, for painters will, for at least a 
century yet, find too much encouragement in Europe to 
permit the establishment of an American school. But 
the many fine casts taken, by permission, of Bonaparte, 
and now exhibited here, offer a feast to better connoisseurs 
than myself, of high relish. During the little time I 
spent there, however, I was highly pleased, among a 
great number my notice was directed to by Lewis, to 
contemplate, particularly, a large and a small Venus de 
Medicis, of which I did not like the line of straight con 
tinuation between the nose and the forehead, so justly 
condemned by Lavater. I speak of the larger of the two, 
which otherwise is exquisite. The other one is a copy in 
marble of Yenus coming out of the bath ; has a better 
face, and is extremely beautiful. The group of Laacoon 
and the Apollo of Belvidere are perfect to my admiration, 
which would not be exhausted upon them for hours ; and 
the Farnesian Hercules is as well copied in our Lavater 
as ever an engraving represented a piece of sculpture 
But Lewis's early dinner hour was at hand, and my appe 
tite for these morceaux was obliged to give way to his for 
his beefsteaks ; so I made only a first offering, on this 
occasion, of my admiration to the artists of antiquity, 
with a devout hope of discharging the full debt of my 
homage hereafter to them, when I shall speak more of 
this Institution. 

Dined with Lewis very agreeably, as usual, and, in the 
evening, young Mr. Coates, son of Samuel Coates, whom 
we knew here in '96, stepped in and invited me to dinner 
for next Monday, at his country place on the Schuylkill, 
to join a small party. 

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 

Having determined, last Wednesday, I would not see 
two days more pass away without leaving my ultimatum 
with Burr, I set out this morning for his quarters, re 
solved to burst the cobweb duplicity of all his evasions 
with me upon money matters. It will be seen every 
where in these notes, how long and how insidiously he 
has trifled with my claims upon him, from the time when 
he assured Barton I was a bankrupt, and denied to him 
my possessing any legal claims upon Alston or himself; 
while, at the distance of fifteen hundred miles, he was 
writing most affectionately to me until the last interview 
I have this day had with him, in which he treated me 
not as a faithful associate, ruined by my past connection 
with him, but rather as an importunate creditor invading 
his leisure or his purse with a questionable account. The 
time therefore has fully arrived, at which I should deter 
mine whether I should attempt to secure upward of 
$7,000 for my family, or sacrifice it to an absurd and am 
phibious character of an associate and confidant in his 
views to future projects, without principle or object, and 
destitute of all means to promote them. Under these 
reflections, patience now became exhausted, and to procrastinate any longer now appeared treason to my family. 
I therefore set seriously about the task I had allotted 
myself for this morning. I found him alone, and had 
not been ten minutes with him, after he had discharged 
a shop-boy, with whom he had been trifling, I know 
not how long, about some article of dress, before he asked 
me if I had heard of Mr. Luckett's treatment of him? 
On my answering in the negative, he informed me that 
Luckett had sent a marshal to him yesterday, and obliged 
him to give bail to the amount of about $16,000, Luck 
ett's claim, I suppose, being about half that sum. This 
intelligence mortified me, as it convinced me I had lost 
time. I expressed my concern for this new embarrassment he had experienced, as it might narrow his means 
to satisfy other claims which he did not consider questionable, like Luckett's. He asked me upon this, what 
claims I alluded to ? I said it was with great regret I 
should mention my own; namely, the amount of the 
account I had furnished him with in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and my 
claim for his protested draft held by Miller, with my in 
dorsement for $4,000, on account of which my property 
on the Ohio had been sacrificed to four times the amount. 
Now, had you seen how " that eye of his did from its 
lustre fly," you would have beheld a little man indeed. 
He was dumb and motionless ; but he soon recovered his 
accustomed affectation, and asked, what was the amount 
of my account, declaring he had never looked into it 
since I had handed him it. I said it was a small one, ob 
viously meaning by com<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>on with most others he had 
settled or secured. "A pretty small one," he replied, 
" of only about $3,000 ; " and said, he had not yet ex 
amined it. This sneer, at the amount of my account, 
and the questioning of its fairness, by referring it to ex 
amination, which he falsely said he had not given it ; for 
he looked it over the evening I presented it at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, 
asked a question or two on some of the items, which I 
answered, informing him I had vouchers for most of 
them, which he said he did not want to see, and was 
satisfied it was correct ; such a diminution of that suavity of address, with which he had already too often 
diverted me from my purpose, now exhibited him a heart 
less swindler in the last swoon of his disorder, and determined me to hasten my departure. I suppose I testified 
my feelings sufficiently by my looks and manner, with 
out removing his doubts of the impression this treatment 
made upon me, by now telling him, as I did, that my 
time and expectations were exhausted, and I should stay 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> no longer; that I perceived he could 
give me no hopes of money, which I did not expect, but 
that, though I was contented to starve myself, I must 
secure something for my family, since I knew he had 
found means in that way to accommodate every other 
creditor, which was all that detained me in town. He 
now pretended he had nobody he could call upon. I 
observed, I thought it very possible he might never 
return from Europe, in which case my family must have 
a security to resort to in this country. To this remark 
he had the kindness to reply, "that when I said my 
family, I meant myself, and that I knew all his friends." 
"You do," said he, "'Mr. Blennahassett " so he has 
frequently pronounced my name before, when he has got 
beyond self-management. "Sir," said I, "I must insist 
upon it, I do not know all your friends." Upon this 
contradiction, he begged my pardon, and said he really 
thought he had informed me of all who were his friends 
in that city.

DEAR SIR : Your favor of the 8th inst. I have received, 
and thank you for the friendly and affectionate sentiments 
you have expressed for me. Should you return by this 
place, you will certainly see me. I shall, I flatter myself, 
occasionally hear from you, should you leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> 
by a different route. I have written to Baldwin and Burnet, and have inclosed for Judge Todd an open letter, 
under cover, to Col. Burr. I certainly should wish to 
avoid a journey to Chillicothe at so severe a season of the 
year, if thought unnecessary. Whether witnesses will at 
tend against Col. Burr or yourself, is uncertain. "Whether 
bills will be found, is more uncertain ; and it is impossible 
that trials should take place at next term, even should 
bills be found. Under these circumstances, the presence 
of neither of us ought to be necessary. We are once more 
at peace ; I mean in the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. The conduct 
of the mob is most unmercifully condemned and dis 
cussed ; and the leaders are, in truth, though they keep 
up the best appearances they can, heartily ashamed of 
themselves. Dr. Commins leaves me to-day, by the 
water-stage. I direct this to his care, lest you should 
have left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. Though I shall ever feel pleased 
in having been introduced to your acquaintance, yet I 
must regret, on your account, the circumstances under 
which that acquaintance hath been formed. You will 
introduce me, though not personally, yet with my best 
regards, to your lady and your little ones; to hear of 
their and your happiness will increase mine. 

I am, my dear Sir, with great sincerity, your friend 
and obedient servant,

MY DEAR WIFE : I have just closed a trunk which, 
with a box, a bundle of coach-harness and a demijohn of 
lamp oil, will leave to-day by the brig Mary, directed to 
you to the care of Lenlow, Turner & Co. In the bottom 
of the trunk you will find two small volumes of my 
notes, intended for no eye at ISTatchez but Harding's and 
your own. You will, therefore, when not in your hands, 
always keep them under lock and key. The ducks are to 
be put upon water, and the pointed end of the magnet 
brought near their beaks to make them approach you ; 
the blunt end will make them recede. Keep the mag 
net from wet, and do n't let it fall. 

I hope you will soon safely receive the things I sent 
before me, which I will follow as soon as I can ; but I find 
it impossible to avoid going to Marietta, without irrep 
arable prejudice to our affairs, and I think it better to 
be a month longer away before we meet, than to have to 
leave you again in August, which might probably happen 
if I did not appear in Ohio, where I may prevent the 
finding of other bills against me, or otherwise get rid of 
the criminal proceedings against me altogether. I there 
fore set out at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning, in the Pitts 
burgh coach, and shall not delay to write to you from 
thence or from Marietta. 

As you will observe by my notes, I apprehend I have 
broken with Aaron Burr on a writ, and shall succeed that 
way, since all others have failed to secure a demand upon 
him of $8,000, as you shall better understand hereafter. 

You may depend upon my exertions to get upon the 
water as speedily as the season and my circumstances will 
permit. I shall give charge of the key of the trunk to 
the Captain of the Mary, or Doctor Bollman, who goes 
passenger in her. I have told him he is recommended to 
your polite attention, if he should visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, as he 
proposes to do ; but beware of the most insidious influence of his manners and address, as they are irresistible 
by ordinary minds. 

It is already reported in the best circles here, that I 
have become a friend to Jefferson. This is amusing, and 
may be very serviceable. 

I have not time to add more, as the mail is near clos 
ing. Tom. Buller is to travel with me as far as Carlisle. 
From your husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT. 
MARIETTA, Dec. 17*A, 7, P. M., <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>. 
DEAR WIFE : I have been here since Tuesday morning, 
and find appearances of every sort infinitely more flattering than I had expected. Col. Gushing has been up to 
see me, and will not leave me before noon to-morrow. I 

have an opportunity, by the favor of Wilkins, on his 

way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, of speedily informing you I shall endeavor 
to fly from the declining storm of Jacobin malice in eight 
or ten days, if the waters will favor my escape. But if they 
do not, you may be assured I have nothing to fear at Chillicothe, where I can overawe the miserable speculations 
of the marshal, based upon the profits he expects to make 
of the trials there. .1 have seen all the negroes, except 
Ransom and Clara ; I think they are well disposed to ac 
company me, and I shall get them off, with more or less 
difficulty. I even propose purchasing Daniel, and a family of six heads, for $1,400. I look daily for the arrival 
of Commins, whom I have joined in fitting out a boat at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>. My coming on here without Commins, was 
to dispatch as much of my business in this quarter as I 
could, while his detained him some time above. I have 
only time to add, I have retained Burnet and Baldwin ; 
the former will be a host of law with the decent part of

the rabble, whom he justly styled his " bloodhounds," and 
has in good training to bait Wilkinson, whenever he gives 
them the scent. God bless you and our dear boys. I hope 
I shall soon embrace you all in health, if Mr. Wilkins was 
not mistaken when he informed me he heard by letter 
from Mr. Elliot, dated in October, you were then well.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, July, 1809. 

MY DEAR SIR: On Saturday, I received from Mr. 
Harding your esteemed letter of the 9th of June, acquainting me with your having consigned your son 
Dominick to me. I accept this trust with pleasure, ac 
companied, at the same time, with great anxiety; and 
you may assure yourself my care of him shall only be 
second to that of my own children. 

Mr. Harding will inform you that the Board of Health 
will not permit him to come into the city before the 4th 
of August, although every one on board the ship was in 
good health, and that, therefore, they have stopped at 
Darby, about seven miles from town, where I have been 
twice to see them, and, yesterday, took Mrs. Lewis with 
me, who feels all a mother's anxious care, and enters into 
Mrs. Blennerhassett's feelings on parting with so beloved 
an object as a son. I have the pleasure to say that I 
have procured a situation for Dominick, such as I think 
you would every way approve, if you were here yourself 
one equally removed from the bigotry of a monastic 
education, and the more uncourtly forms of our society. 
The Academy to which I refer was established, about four 
years ago, by a number of our most respectable gentle 
men, for the education of their own children, and is 
conducted by two French gentlemen of the name of 
Out*. 

The situation of the school is high, healthy and pleas 
ant, about four miles north of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a distance 
which will afford me an opportunity of seeing Dominick 
often, and of bringing him home occasionally to spend a 
holiday. Mr. Harding being obliged to leave this morning for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, Dominick has been placed under the 
charge of a respectable old lady, where I shall see him 
every day or two until his quarantine is out ; after which 
I shall bring him home, and, as soon as every thing is 
prepared, place him with Messrs. Carre*, who are men of 
amiable and respectable character, sufficiently rigid to 
keep their boys within a correct line. Present my best 
regards to Mrs. Blennerhassett, and also those of Mrs. 
L. ; tell her to dissipate all anxiety about her son. that 
Mrs. L. will take upon herself a mother's care, and that 
my affection for his parents will insure my attention to 
his comforts, to his wants, and to his well-doing. * * * 

Yours, with great esteem, J. S. LEWIS.

From Thomas Addis Emmett. 

YORK, Sept. 15^, 1809. 

MY DEAR BLENNERHASSETT : It was not without considerable emotion and pleasure that I received yours a 
few days since by Mr. Harding, and heard from him the 
first news I had been able, authentically, to collect of 
your present situation. Of what is past, it is not fit I 
should say any thing in a communication of this kind ; 
of the future, you will believe me perfectly sincere, when 
I assure you that your prosperity and happiness will 
always interest me very strongly. In return for the 
pleasing intelligence I have had of you, accept similar 
accounts of me and my family. My success has been 
greater than I could have calculated upon. My health 
has been extremely good, and Mrs. Emmett and the 
children enjoy the prosperity which has succeeded to our 
trials ; such, I trust, will also be the event of your present 
situation. Mr. Harding mentioned to me that he had 
brought along with him your oldest son, Dominick, and 
placed him at an Academy at Germantown, Pennsylvania. 

As Mrs. Blennerhassett has brought her mind to part 
with him, a thought struck me, which I now lay before 
you. I have three sons at school at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=flatbush" rel="city">Flatbush</a>, Long 
Island, five miles from this city, under the care of a Mr. 
Thompson, who is very competent, a graduate of Trinity 
College,' Dublin, and of very unexceptionable character ; 
his wife is a Mary Anne Connell, cousin to Maurice Connell, of Iveragh ; came over here a widow, of the name 
of Yielding, with strong letters from Kerry friends to 
Mrs. Emmett, and was married in my house to Mr. 
Thompson. I have mentioned your son to them both, 
and can answer that he would be treated with more than 
common affection and care ; and, being at the same school 
with my own, I should have opportunities of showing 
him, perhaps, some attention, which, situated where he 
is, would be out of my power. I am not fond of sup 
planting a person like his present master, who, I presume, 
would discharge his duty, but I submit the proposition to 
your consideration. 

Adieu, my dear Blennerhassett. Do you and Mrs. B. 
receive the best wishes of me and my family for every 
thing that concerns you, and believe me sincerely 
Yours. THOS. ADDIS EMMETT.

MY DEAR FRIEND : About ten days ago I received your 
esteemed letter of 8th August, and I enter with much 
warmth into your situation and the means proposed for 
improving it. I have been engaged, in my mind, since 
its receipt, to contrive some way of meeting your desire 
of obtaining the sum you want to borrow, but I do not 

find any one here who is willing to lend money on such 
34 
distant security ; and even the offer of more than usual 
interest would serve to introduce in the mind of strangers 
a doubt of the goodness of the security ; and there are 
none of our money-lenders who would be willing to take 
the chance of being compelled to go to Ohio or the Mis 
sissippi Territory, to look after his payment. I propose, 
then, that after the sale of your cotton, which we hourly 
expect from New Orleans, you should draw, in addition 
to what our advance may then be, as much as will make 
$5,000, which you shall have at six per cent, interest per 
annum. You are to consign to us all your cotton for 
sale, on which we shall charge the usual commission 
of five per cent. * * * 

Very respectfully your friend, ' * J. S. LEWIS.

MY DEAR FRIEND: Your favor of 14th November I 
received yesterday, and am much pleased to learn the 
happy effect of my last letter upon your uneasiness about 
Dominick, whom I have not seen for a few weeks, but 
I hear from him frequently ; and, a few days ago, I saw 
Mr. Carre*, who said he was well, and spoke favorably 
of an increased attention to his studies. There is no 
doubt you can obtain excellent lodgings in the neigh 
borhood of the city, at a moderate rate, say five or six 
dollars a week each, for Mrs. Blennerhassett and yourself, 
including board. I suppose your passages would cost 
$100 each ; about half that for your son, and the same 
rate for your servants. I should think $1,100 or $1,200 
would be an ample allowance for your expenses for a trip 
of five or six months, bating the temptations such a large 
shop as our city would afford you to lay out money for 
luxuries, etc., which, of course, your own prudence would, 
in some measure, guard you against. On the score of 
health the jaunt would be desirable, and I shall be glad 
you make use of any excuse to give Mrs. Lewis and 
myself the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

Very respectfully your friend, J. S. LEWIS.

I can not conceive any reason why the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> mar 
ket should offer a better price for cotton than ours. It is 
not quite so steady, and the people are more speculative. 
If your cotton goes there to our correspondent, we must 
pay his commission, and we should not be quite so well 
satisfied of the solidity of the persons to whom sale 
would generally be made as here. 

Your cotton has arrived, but I can not at present effect 
a sale on such terms as I like. The gloomy prospect of 
our affairs with England is such, that we do not consider 
a speculation in cotton as safe, and its value here will also 
be much affected by the proceedings of Congress regarding the Bank of the United States. If the charter should 
not be renewed, and there seems much doubt of it, prices 
of every article will fall very materially. In addition to 
this, the situation of exchange is such, that bills can no A 
be drawn on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> without the utmost difficulty, and 
then at a loss of seven or eight per cent. 

The proceeds of your cotton now on hand, and for 
which at present there is no sale, we estimate at $2,000. 
Yours very respectfully, J. S. LEWIS.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, March 26th, 1811. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor of 27th ult. has just reached 
me, and it affords me much pleasure in hearing from you. 
It would be very gratifying if it were oftener. I regret 
extremely that you should be thrown back by want of a 
sufficient capital to work your estate to the best advan 
tage, and I should be extremely happy in offering you an 
increase of the credit sometime ago granted you ; but 
even that credit is very inconvenient, in consequence of 
the uncommon situation of the times. Owing to the 
charter of the United States Bank having expired, and 
the severance of our intercourse with England, a total 
stagnation of "business has occurred, and we want all our 
means to make ourselves comfortable, when our stores 
are overloaded with goods, etc. Your cotton we have 
not been able to sell a bale of, and our advances for you, 
at this moment, are about $8,000. Under all these circumstances I can not encourage you to draw any further, 
but certainly I will not dishonor those already drawn, 
and which you have advised as payable at September 'and 
January next, and the one to Capt. Yidal of $700, relying that you will, as early as possible, send your cotton 
down to our friends at New Orleans, with orders to sell 
it, or send it round here as soon as they can, as we may 
meet some chance of selling it ; and you may be assured, 
that whenever I can do it, I will extend the credit. 

I hope you may succeed in making a sale of your 
Island. I have recently heard from, Mr. Woodbridge, 
who was in town a few days ago, that your house on the 
Island was burned down, and it happened in consequence 
of Miller having stored it with hemp, which took fire 
from a candle taken in by a negro woman. I most 
heartily regret this circumstance, which must injure the 
value of the property ; but I should conceive Miller was 
liable in having done what his lease could not authorize, 
making a storehouse of a dwelling. As to Alston, there 
seems no chance of a recovery from him. 

Your letter for Dominick I will send to him ; he con 
tinues in good health, and is improving in his studies. 
Mrs. L. and my family are all well. I hope you will be 
able to make your arrangements in such a way as will 
enable us to see personally that you and Mrs. B. are so 
too. Present my best respects, and believe me ever 
Yours, Jos. S. LEWIS.

DEAR SIR : Your favors have all been replied to. We 
have not been able to dispose of your cotton, and the 
price is nominally thirteen cents. We see no better prospect for what is to come, and we therefore recommend 
your sending your new crop to Amory Callender, New 
Orleans, with orders to sell it at once, and remit us as 
soon as they can. Our political affairs do not promise 
us much amendment in the article of cotton, and the 
sooner, therefore, it can be turned into money the better. 
Dominick is well, and improves in his studies considerably. Your cotton here is still on hand.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Dec. 13th, 1811. 

DEAR SIR : Your esteemed favor of 19th ult., dated at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, reached us yesterday, and affords us pleasure to 
learn that you and your family were recovering from 
your sickness, which has been so generally fatal upon the 
Mississippi this year. On the score of confidence in you, 
we should not decline to accept your bills for any reason 
able sum, in addition to what we are already in advance, 
but these are not times when we can do so without very 
great inconvenience. Business generally is suspended, 
and the usual facilities of procuring money are cut off. 
In fact, two years ago, the advance of $6,000 could not 
have been so inconvenient as $1,000 now. Our advance 
now is about $13,000, and taking into view your cotton 
here, and what we may receive of your next crop, the 
whole will not amount to $3,600, and this will be a long 
time first. Under these circumstances, we have concluded not to accept your last bill of $600 to W. Jackson 
& Co., although the alternative is extremely painful to 
us ; but as there seems a prospect of making sale to Mr. 
Anthony, of your Island, we shall immediately write to 
him, and if it should seem likely the business can be concluded in a reasonable time, we will take care that your 
bill shall not go back. "We have given as a reason for 
non-acceptance, that it is for want of advice. After 
offering your cotton upon every occasion for sale, with 
out effect, and seeing no prospect of a favorable result by 
keeping it longer, we have concluded to ship it to Liver 
pool, and have put it on board the ship United States, 
which being intended for your interest, we have no doubt 
you will approve. With respect to the present crop, we 
recommend you to direct to Messrs. Amory, Callender & 
Co., to make sale of it immediately, and remit at once to 
us, or, if they can not do this, to lose no time in shipping 
it to Liverpool, consigned to Messrs. Leigh & Shellock. 
Here, it will not sell for more than at !N"ew Orleans. Our 
brother in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> sold a large parcel last week at 10J 
cents. We see no prospect of an improvement in cotton 
while the continent is shut. England has now two years 
supply on hand, and unless this market is opened to her 
manufactories, cotton will go down. Dominick is in 
excellent health, and very contented with his situation. 
With our best respects to your good lady, and our sincere 
regards for yourself, we remain, 

Your friends, Jos. S. LEWIS & Co.

Your esteemed lines of 1st instant I received on Sun

your crop reaching Kew Orleans, and if your correspondent there ship it at once to Liverpool, it may do well, as 
the article has risen by the last accounts, and I hope we 
shipped yours by the United States at a favorable moment.

it may be to you, thai you have correctness of mind sufficient to estimate the true reason, and not feel offended at 
the circumstance. Dominick is well, but has not been in

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Feb. 22d, 1812. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor of llth January has reached 
us only yesterday, and its perusal has caused us some very 
unpleasant feelings, in the reflection of your situation, as 
you now paint it. "We would willingly make any sacri 
fice in reason to help you, but the reasons which induced 
the refusal of your bill still operate, and with our capital 
locked up with you, and more largely in other places, we 

have not the means, without great inconvenience, to advance further. The bill of $600 has gone back, and is 
now too late to help it, or we would go that step further ; 
but we will do this : Send your cotton to our friends at 
New Orleans, with orders to sell the same, if it will bring 
a price that you think enough, and if it will not, to ship 
it immediately to Messrs. Leigh & Shellock, of Liverpool, 
and you may, on its arrival at New Orleans, draw upon 
us for two-thirds of whatever our friends say would prob 
ably be the net proceeds of the cotton if sold at the cur 
rent price at that time at New Orleans. This, it appears 
to us, will relieve you, and, at the same time, make us a 
small payment on account. Your cotton will probably net 
you 12 cents, which, on 40,000 Ibs., is $4,800, two-thirds 
of which is $3,200, which is about the sum you have 
stated as being wanted by you to meet your debts and 
provide for family expenses. You have never mentioned 
to us what quantity of ground you hold, and the number 
of your negroes which would be a satisfaction to us to 
know, that in case of accident to you, these would be 
something for your family, as well as for us. 

We have corresponded with Mr. J. C. Anthony, and 
prepared to meet him at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, to complete the 
contract. We inclose you copies of his letters to us, by 
which you will see you are very wide in your idea of the 
value of the Island; we should think that money is 
worth more to you than any rise in the property will ever 
realize, and if he comes near your mark, should accept 
the offer. 

As to the removal of Dominick, on account of the cost 
of his education, that is quite out of the question, and no 
more need be said on that business. 

It will afford us the highest gratification to learn that 
the plan proposed meets your view, and will answer your 
purpose. 

We hope for better times, which will enable you to 
resume that feeling of independence which you so much 
enjoy ; and, in the mean time, we remain, very sincerely, 
Your friends, J. S. LEWIS & Co.

DEAR BLENNERHASSETT : I hope, and am willing to 
believe, that a letter. I wrote you now some four or five 
years since, and which remains unanswered, was never 
received by you. It was directed in the same way as 
this, and the uncertainty of its fate makes me wish I 
knew a more safe and sure direction. I can not, however, permit the inclosed,* which I have recently received 
from Ireland, to go forward without accompanying it by 
a few words from myself. 

Mr. Berwick has written to me also, and so far as I can 
judge, considering your situation, and the almost impos 
sibility of your pursuing your claim, I think the proposal 
contained in his letter very advantageous. It is very seldom that an opportunity occurs here of learning any par 
ticulars respecting individuals in your part of the world ; 
but I have been led to hope that you have found it pleasant and profitable to yourself and family ; and I assure 
you few persons would more rejoice at your prosperity 
than myself.

Your dear and long-looked-for letter from Quebec 
reached me a fortnight ago, and would have been much 
more welcome without the melancholy memento that 
accompanied it, though such precaution, I must confess, 
is necessary where a family is concerned ; and I trust in 
God we have yet two children worthy of all we can do 
for them. Dominick * sailed three weeks ago for Savannah, where he may, from all accounts, do well. As to 
St. Domingo, that place is now out of the question, for 
many reasons you may have heard respecting its present 
situation. * * * * 

You will be surprised to learn where I am now ; I there 
fore will endeavor to state every thing concerning us 
since we parted, providing you have never received the 
letter I wrote on leaving Troy, where I found it impossible to settle with either convenience or economy ; though 



" 'T is right well done ; bear all, and more, I say ; 
Nay. ten times more ; and then for more still pray ! 
What State in something would not foremost be? 
She strives for fame, thou for servility." 

* Eldest son of Blennerhassett. 
Mr. Dickenson made every exertion in his power for my 
accommodation. He then advised my coming to the 
neighborhood of Tew York, and mentioned this place or 
Greenwich. 

I therefore came to Mr. Emmett for further advice, and 
he thought this place would be best, and gave me a letter 
to the Professor of the Academy here, who has been 
very kind to me. I found boarding here very high, and 
therefore engaged two rooms in a farm-house, at three 
dollars a week, and have Harmaii* with me, who has 
not, nor is likely to get, employment ; and I find, after 
all the saving in my power, I can not maintain my two 
children, Mary and myself, under ten dollars a week, in 
cluding every thing. * * * * 
My dear kind friends, the Emmetts, have been my greatest support. Could I tell you all the affectionate kindness they have lavished on us, you would scarcely credit 
even me. Mrs. Emmett was not in town when I first ar 
rived, but came in next day to see me. We cried together 
a long time, and Mr. Emmett said we were so foolish he 
must leave us. I went out with them to the country, 
where I spent three days. I did not wish to stay so long, 
but Lewis was with me, and so delighted with the beauti 
ful place and all the attention he received, that I wished 
to indulge him ; besides, I found Mrs. Emmett's advice 
and consolation acted powerfully in restoring me to some 
tranquillity; for never in my life have I been so com 
pletely wretched as since I parted from you. She would 
not hear of my doing any thing in the way of gaining a 
livelihood while any prospect remained of your preferment, but cheered me with hopes of your success. They 
were then preparing to go on a visit to Potsdam, to their 
daughter ; but Harman has seen them since, and told 
them of my present plan, which they highly approve. 

It is this : on finding what my expenses, at the lowest 
calculation, amounted to here, I wrote to my sister to let 
me know what we could get boarding for in Wilksbarre, 
thinking, should you be detained any time, I might there 
make out much longer than here. To this letter, written 
a fortnight since, I have just received an answer. Sister 
is delighted, and has engaged boarding at two dollars for 
me and one for Lewis,* per week. As for Mary, I do n't 
know what they will charge ; for, intending to persuade 
her to find a place here, I never mentioned her, and now 
find it impossible to get rid of her. She positively de 
clares she will never leave me, nor suffer me to pay a 
dollar for her traveling expenses ; she agrees only to let 
me pay for her board, as she thinks my washing would 
cost me as much. 

Mr. D. wrote to me to get Mr. Emmett to address a 
recommendation to the Secretary of War for Harman ; 
but no answer has been returned, and, from all accounts, 
there are too many applicants for West Point to expect 
success. Poor fellow ! he is one of the best children, 
and the kindest of brothers. He managed Dominick as 
if he had been an old man, and now labors hard in 
teaching Lewis; so he will not forget what he already 
knows. You would be delighted to hear the Emmetts 

* Third son of Blennerhas&ett. 
praise him. Mrs. Emmett took me up to the top of the 
house to show me the room she had prepared for him 
when first he came, and complained of his not taking it. 
Young Swartwout overpowers him with kindness, and 
is, like many others, endeavoring to get him some em 
ployment. We shall set out for AVilksbarre in a few days. 
# * * # This house is only three miles 

from the bay ; and on a still night, when I could not sleep, 
but listened to the roaring of the sea, O ! it was dreadful. 
Poor Dominick, perhaps he is yet on it. God help me ! 
I have lived too long, indeed, yet I still hope to be pre 
served to meet you again; and could I render the remainder of your life happy, what matters all the present 
sufferings I undergo. 

Your affectionate wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT.

MY EVER DEAR HUSBAND : Your letter of the 29th of 
August, the first I have received since you sailed from 
Quebec, brings with it sensations I can not describe. 
After the dreadful despondency 'I have endured, for a 
period longer than I could have ever conceived myself 
capable, so extreme has been my wretchedness, that I 
have often conceived myself sinking into a state that 
promised a speedy termination of my sorrows : yet, as 
often have I rallied again, and struggled against such 
forebodings for the sake of my darling Lewis alone. 
Another thing that has caused me more recently to hope, 
was a communication from Mr. Dow, saying that he had 
learned, by a letter from B. Stafford, that you had left 
Ireland, and was in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, prosecuting a suit against 
Lord Ross, in which it was generally thought you would 
be successful. Here was, then, the dreadful fear of your 
death removed, and though I had no idea that fortune 
would ever again smile upon us, at least to any great 
extent, I thought the celebrity of such a suit might be 
favorable to your prospects in Canada. 

I have only written once since my letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=flatbush" rel="city">Flatbush</a>, 
not knowing afterward where to direct. I remained at 
Wilksbarre from the last of August to the 2cth of December, when I was induced to come here, partly by the 
hope of being more in the way of receiving your letters, 
the cross mails being very uncertain, and partly, if pos 
sible, to save poor Dominick ; but I will not anticipate. 

I wrote you that he had sailed for Savannah ; and, 
endeavoring to discard him from my thoughts, I went 
with Harman and Lewis to "Wilksbarre. I placed the 
former with Doctor Covel, a skillful and worthy Yankee, 
who paid him great attention without, as yet, demanding 
any remuneration ; the latter had the benefit of a good 
country school, which he attended regularly. Mary re 
sided with my sister, Mrs. Dow, where she did enough to 
pay for her board, and washed for us. I obtained board 
for the boys and myself at six dollars per week ; this 
agreed with my finances, and I willingly endured the 
canting and vulgarity of the people of AVilksbarre for 
such advantages. But after getting my mind composed 
on Dominick's account, having received two letters from 
Savannah, saying he was doing well, his correspondence 
suddenly ceased. Some ten weeks elapsed, when I received another from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, announcing his arrival 
there in the most deplorable condition, after having 
escaped, as he expressed it, burying his bones in the 
sands of Savannah, where he had had a long and re 
peated attack of yellow fever. His life had been saved 
38 
by a friendly physician ; but his protracted confinement 
had involved him so in debt, that, when scarcely able to 
walk, he shipped himself privately for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, rather 
than be taken to die, as he must certainly have done, in 
jail. He had given his clothes and books to defray his 
passage to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> ; and, but for the humanity of an 
Englishman, who is the keeper of a small tavern here, 
might have lain down to rest in the streets of the city. 
I wrote to Robert Emmett to give him twenty dollars out 
of my half-year's dividend I had ordered to be paid to 
him, with which request he complied, and answered me, 
saying that his embarrassments prevented him from offering money, though Dotoinick had not communicated to 
him his necessities. Afterward, I received another com 
munication from D., stating that he had determined no 
longer to be a burden to me; that he had gone to the 
]STavy-Yard, to enlist as a common marine, in hopes that, 
by good conduct, he might be appointed to a good position in the hospital; but that on being referred to the 
surgeon for examination, he was rejected, in consequence of the critical condition of his health. Mr. Em 
mett had previously written me that D. was much 
improved, and that he yet hoped he might do well. I 
dreaded his enlisting, though the surgeon, on inquiring 
his name, advised him against it, and promised his influence in having him appointed as an assistant; and, 
though well aware you will blame me, I could not rest 
while his fate was so doubtful; but, in dreadful weather, 
over the roughest roads, we set out, and reached this on 
Christmas Eve. Robert Emmett was conducting me to 
their house, when Dorninick espied me, and hid, rather 
than excite my feelings in the street. 'T was well he 
did ; for the next morning, when he came to me at Mr. 
E.'s, his appearance was shocking beyond all description. 
It gave me, however, consolation to know that my timely 
appearance prevented his enlistment; for, on that very 
day, he had resolved to do so, as the only means of 
escaping starvation. He said he was quite restored ; but 
such restoration I never saw. When I witnessed my once 
dear child's situation, I felt, indeed, that I had lived too 
long. I dismissed the poor fellow with a trifle to aid his 
most pressing wants, not wishing him to return to the 
military station at Brooklyn, where, for some days, he 
had been assisting in the hospital, and living with the 
common soldiers. After consulting with my friends, Mr. 
and Mrs. Emmett, I wrote to Colonel Henderson, at 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, who commands the corps, and in a few days 
received one of the most generous arid gratifying answers 
that I could have desired. He said that to have an opportunity of obliging where he owed obligations never to be 
forgotten, gave him real pleasure ; that he had taken my 
letter to the Secretary of War, and obtained the promise 
of an appointment, as surgeon's assistant, for my son, in 
Commodore Porter's Expedition, which was to sail in a 
short time ; requested me to lose no time ; and, as you 
were absent, solicited me, in the most generous manner, 
to draw on him for any sum I deemed necessary for Dominick's outfit. I showed this letter to Mr. and Mrs. 
Emmett, and, of course, not choosing to incur a pecu 
niary obligation, and as Dominick's reformed habits jus 
tified my doing the best I could for my child, we agreed 
that T ought to sell a share of my bank stock, which was 
accordingly done ; and, after the necessary clothing, with 
money sufficient to bear his traveling expenses to Wash 
ington, I bid him farewell, with more extatic happiness 
than I conceived myself capable of experiencing under 
my gloomy apprehensions as to yourself. Col. Henderson 
having requested me to send him directly to his house, 
where, I am told, he lives in very genteel style, on Dominick's arrival, received him as kindly as his own son, and 
wrote me immediately to assure me of Dominick's safety, 
and of the expected sailing of the expedition in a few 
days. 

I heard no more from D. for a week, when you may 
guess my astonishment on his entering my room like an 
apparition. To tell you what passed is useless, but I 
gathered from him enough to convince me that by the 
return of his old habits he had completely disgusted Col. 
Henderson, who had given him thirty dollars to bring 
him back to his most unfortunate mother. I gather from 
Dominick, that he received a severe reprimand from the 
Colonel, who yet assured him that if he would give him 
his word that he would never again so far forget himself 
as to get intoxicated, he should still go in the expedition. 
Dominick's answer was that he could not answer for 
himself. Thus ended the business, and thus am I bur 
dened with this unfortunate child, whose existence I 
will prolong, while my own lasts, whether you gain an 
independence, or I am obliged to retire to a situation 
which, however humble, will yet afford me the means of 
giving him bread ; and which I now no more expect him 
to gain himself than I should do had it pleased God to 
bring him an idiot into the world. My obligations, in 
that event, could not be greater to maintain him than it 
is at present ; indeed, the most hopeless idiot has no 
more claims on a mother's care and solicitude than he ; 
for I firmly believe he has no longer the power to refrain 
from drink ; and did I not guard him, even to the pres 
ervation and custody of his own clothes, he would be 
stripped at once ; yet he is to me as docile as a lamb, and 
I have placed him with a poor but excellent woman, who 
boards him for three dollars and a half a week. I can 
not trust him with money, though certainly there never 
was a more devotedly affectionate son. Harman feels 
just as I do, and were I on my death-bed I should not 
fear to resign to him the care of his unfortunate brother. 
* * * * Should you return next month, 

as your letter to Mr. Emmett mentions, I shall hope we 
may return to Canada. If your expectations are suffi 
ciently encouraging to detain you in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> on this law 
writ, and should you be successful even in gaining a fair 
compromise, I trust we shall soon be able to go to you ; 
for, let our situation be what it may, never can I think 
of ending my days in this country. Mr. Emmett is in 
"Washington, but Mrs. E. showed me your letter, which 
she will retain until his return, which is expected in a 
fortnight. To tell you how I love this family would be 
impossible. It grieves me, therefore, to say that I think 
they are somewhat embarrassed, at present, in their cir 
cumstances. They lost their fine son, Temple,* last 
autumn, who died of the yellow fever, on board of the 
Macedonian. ***** * 

I have written a long letter, that you may never receive ; hut I trust, if not, you will he on the water on 
your return. My mind seems huoyed up now for hap 
piness, and whether poverty or affluence awaits us, every 
effort of my declining years shall be used to make yours 
pass with as little uneasiness as can he expected to await 
on old age and disappointed hopes. For my part, for 
upward of eight months, I have endured too much to 
look forward without hope to the future that will restore 
you to 

Your affectionate, M. BLENNERHASSETT.

MY DEAR MADAM : I do not know when I have received 
a letter which has conveyed to my mind such strong rec 
ollections of mingled pleasure and pain. It has irre 
sistibly carried me hack to the period when, under your 
hospitable roof, I received every attention of hospitality 
and kindness ; it was my debut in life. I have often 
spoke, and far often er thought, of the halo that was 
thrown over my monotony of existence, in that wild 
country, by my visits at the beautiful and isolated spot of 
your former residence. I must, however, cease to write 
on this subject. As long as my heart beats and feels, I 
shall never forget your kindness ; I therefore need not 
say with how much alacrity and anxiety I took your letter to the Secretary of the Navy, and how much pleasure 
it gives me to communicate to you that he has the goodness to consent that Dorriinick may go, as a volunteer 
surgeon's mate, in this piratical expedition, with the usual 
pay and emoluments. No appointments can be now 
made, and the Secretary of the Navy will not pledge 
himself as to any future appointment; I therefore hope, 
my dear madam, you will he satisfied with what has been 
procured. I spoke to Mr. Dickinson on the subject last 
night ; he will enforce all future arrangements. 

Dominick had better come here as soon as possible, 
and bring his trunk to my house. As Mr. Blennerhassett is away, I hope I may take the liberty, which gratitude for former kindness now induces me to take, to offer 
my young friend any assistance Ije may require in coming on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and any draft for that purpose, I 
hope he will not hesitate to make on me. I trust you 
will excuse me if I feel over-anxious ; 't is my gratitude 
alone. that prompts it. 

I now conclude, assuring you that I feel every solicitude in serving you and yours, and I beg you to believe 
me, with gratitude and truth, 

Sincerely yours, ARCH. HENDERSON.

MY DEAR MADAM : Dominick arrived a few days ago, 
and is awaiting the arrival of Captain Porter, who is 
daily expected here to proceed on the service that has 
been marked out for him. It is fortunate some little 
delay has taken place, as he is somewhat indisposed from 
the fatigue of traveling, and will not prevent his joining 
the expedition on which he is to proceed. 

I should have sooner answered your kind letter of the 
llth, but thought it better to wait until he had left me 
for Norfolk ; but as that may not be the case for several 
days, I have concluded to write lest you might feel some 
anxiety at not hearing. 

Your indisposition, I hope, may be evanescent. You 
rate entirely too high the trifling service it has been in 
my power to do you. It is indeed trifling when compared 
with that received by me from you and yours. I shall 
carry the recollection of it with me "to that bourn 
whence no traveler returns." I am much of a wanderer 
still, and I may yet hope to meet you in this world. 
Should Mr. B. still reside in Canada, I shall probably see 
you next summer, as I have it in contemplation to de 
scend the lakes to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=montreal" rel="city">Montreal</a>. This world, however, is 
full of change ; it may therefore be our fate never again 
to meet here, but I sincerely wish that your decline of 
life may be less checkered than its spring and summer 
have been ; that it may be rendered happy, and that the 
scions which are growing up around the parent tree, may 
invigorate, support and comfort it, until it is cut down 
by the same hand that planted and caused it to grow. 

I will write again when Dominick leaves me, and, in 
the mean time, beg you to believe me with sincere regards 

Yours, A. HENDERSON.

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Let me flatter myself that, hav 
ing, as I hope, received my last two letters, written since 
39 
I received yours inclosing the gift from my aunt, this, 
penned at the commencement of a new year, may find 
you more cheerful than myself, though my situation is in 
no way changed, and we are all well. But, it having heen 
so long since we have heard from you, and dreading the 
delays of the approaching season, my spirits have become 
exceedingly depressed. You must not forget that if I am 
condemned to live separated from you, my only solace is 
in your frequent letters. If I am not permitted, as the last 
comfort of my declining life, to watch over yours, let me, 
at least, know that you are well, and I shall not murmur. 
I trust, therefore, you will not again condemn me to the 
anxieties of a six months' silence. 

My last letter was forwarded several days since, by New 
York, and I now avail myself of the opportunity of send 
ing, by Mr. David, the Jew, who sets out for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> in 
two days, trusting that some of my letters, at least, may 
reach you. 

I am told here that any young man may get into 
the marines, through naval interposition ; and as a war 
seems approaching, and poor Harman has no prospect of 
a maintenance but what I may afford: him, I wish you to 
exert yourself among our relatives to accomplish this, if 
possible. Could we succeed in getting a situation for him, 
and should you fail in procuring one for yourself, we might 
still provide for the education of Lewis, so as to fit him 
in turn for some one of the useful occupations of life. If 
I have been misinformed as to the facilities of getting into 
the marine corps, I wish to be advised as to conditions 
under which an applicant can enter without such inter 
position as my kind friend, Mrs. T , would endeavor 
to get her younger son into that service, and could I be 
lieve, if necessary, purchase in. If I have harbored false 
hopes for Harman, darken them at once rather than keep 
me in suspense. 

I have been very much alarmed, since I last wrote, for the 
fate of our friend Rossiter, who has been confined these last 
five weeks with a liver complaint, which brought him to 
the brink of the grave. He is now, however, nearly recov 
ered, although it will be some time before he can get out. 

By the time this reaches you I suppose our old friend 
Devereux will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. He is now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, 
the received ambassador from the Colombian Republic. 
His laurels have been dearly won. I would give much 
to see him, but that is impossible. However, I think 
that, should you see his name announced in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, it 
might be worth while to go and see him, as he could cer 
tainly do something for Harman, should what I have 
before proposed fail. You know my disposition too well 
to wonder at the solicitude I feel for my child; and, even 
if my efforts should all prove fruitless, it will still be a 
cause of consolation to know that I have done all in my 
power to serve him. 

I have promised you some pleasing intelligence in my 
last two letters, which I hope and believe I shall soon be 
able to communicate ; but the time for it has not yet 
arrived ; when it does, be assured that no pleasure could 
be much to me without your participation. 

The winter here is very severe ; but I find so much 
more comfort than I did last season, in Kew York, that, 
while I can live, I will not repine, and trust you will follow my example. Say every thing for me to my dear 
friends who kindly interest themselves in my behalf. 
God only knows whether ever again I shall see them or 
be permitted to enjoy any friendship, other than that of 
strangers, yet for this I am not unthankful. There are 
some of these, even, who are unremitting in their kindness. While from what is called society, that is, parties, 
I am excluded, as I must necessarily be, both from my 
situation and inclinations, yet, I am seldom alone, and 
continue to take exercise enough for health, as severe as 
the season is. This is the first winter for nine years that 
I have escaped a cold, or have not suffered from a return 
of my breast complaint. It is certainly cause for thank 
fulness, as a similar attack to that of last winter would 
rob my dear Lewis of his only protection. 

Adieu ! my dear husband. Take care of yourself, and 
some happiness may yet be in store for 

Your wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT.

(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.) 

STOKETON HOUSE, March 29^, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1824">1824</a>. 

MY DEAR NEV. : How fully I am persuaded your anx 
iety to serve me is solicitous to consider the best means 
of availing yourself of such opportunities to do so, as 
this, your second visit to Portugal, may offer, I will leave 
to futurity to evince through the grateful affection of a 
distressed family, whose head is already devoted to you. 
If, therefore, you have acceded to my wish in accepting 
the offer I have made you, to put on paper my views of 
the best means of succeeding for me, you will not im 
agine that in so doing I have any purpose, either to 
stimulate your zeal or to induce you t ) substitute my 
judgment and policy for your own, in scenes and circum 
stances of which you will be able to judge on the spot, 
but which I can only estimate through, perhaps, a delusive medium at a distance. If the suggestions I am 
about to present to you should be sanctioned by the 
results of your own observation, or modified by the char 
acters and circumstances that you will be concerned with, 
an occasional review of the former may not, however, be 
quite useless as a sort of chart on which you may prick 
off your course, not so much by the bearings and dis 
tances I have set down, as by the winds and currents of 
party and intrigue you may be affected by in the voyage. 

Without further preamble, then, I conceive the means 
of effecting my introduction into the civil service of the 
Portuguese Government can only be obtained through 
the patronage of the actual minister, whether Pampeluna 
or any other. "Without such a passport it will be in vain 
to linger in the confidence which even the King's prom 
ises may inspire, or the assurances his other courtiers 
may profess ; the former can never be realized without 
the fiat of the minister ; the influence and sincerity of the 
latter must submit to the same test. 

The best affections of a monarch, situated as is John 
VI, must ever be confined to the royal breast, powerless 
and inert, until the minister shall become the conductor 
between them and the object to which they are directed. 
Hence arises the necessity of engaging the minister's interest, at a period early enough to prevent his suspicion 
of neglect. But upon what terms, i. e., through the in 
sinuation of what future return, on the part of the candi 
date, is the first question of either doubt or difficulty that 
presents itself? Kow, whatever may be your views or 
policy of the minister, I should not hesitate to pledge 
myself to espouse them all, subject to the proviso that 
nothing therein tended to the detriment of his Majesty. 
Ever alive to the influence of this sentiment, I should 
make no compromise, nor hold any interview with the 
party of the Queen or Don Miguel, even if I could in 
trigue for my object through their influence. But to a 
candidate, circumstanced as I am, there can be no great 
difficulty in choosing between the French and English 
parties at court, should such an election become neces 
sary. In the present state of Portugal, which, politically, 
if not commercially speaking, must, under continental 
contact, yield to the destinies of Spain, I could conscien 
tiously enlist under the banners of the shortest side, 
which I would endeavor accurately to ascertain before 
hand. So far this outline is made to include advances to 
foreign ministers, as well as Pampeluna, especially the 
French and Russian, whose interest ought, at the same 
time, to be early courted. When it is represented to all 
these personages that the candidate, who had already 
obtained some royal notice of the recommendation which 
the King has favorably received of him, is qualified as a 
jurist and a scholar to serve his Majesty in any diplo 
matic or judicial office; and you may add, if every thing 
else fails, as a forlorn hope, " in an ecclesiastical charac 
ter," that in Europe or America he would strenuously and ably advance the best interest of his patrons in a 
diplomatic character, etc. 

I trust it is not too much to expect, that if your exertions should overreach their farthest aim, they will not 
altogether fall short without reaching some intermediate 
point between total failure and success, where I may find 
myself once entered upon some station in which I may 
subsist until I can thence work out promotion. I will 
exemplify my meaning here by observing, that I should 
not deem it disparagement of the condition I derive from 
my ancestry and profession, of which even poverty must 
not divest me, to accept any situation, any where, not 
even excepting Angela, which was not beneath the rank 
of a consul or collector. As to location, my preference 
would be first in Europe, next in America, any where 
preferable to the United States, where, being obnoxious 
as a persecuted supporter heretofore of legitimate mon 
archy, I could not so easily fill all the duties of a diplo 
matic station. Should such an appointment be unattain 
able, you will next try to work out one in the law ; or if 
that fail too, then, finally, endeavor to obtain such an 
establishment in the Church as in its income would enable 
me to spare you two or three hundred pounds a year, 
after leaving me as much more on which to subsist. 
Kow, this is the only topic of this letter ; I wish you to 
regard it as inviolably confidential ; for, although I could 
as easily satisfy your reason and feelings as my own, that 
I should neither offend against the duties of true religion 
and morality, in accepting such a treasure, were it not 
even justified as the best effort I could make for a 
starving family ; yet how vain would the undertaking 
prove with others ! If, then, you should be reduced to 
the necessity of canvassing for me in a spiritual charac 
ter, you need not hesitate to say of me, " que vous un 
connaissez un bon Catholique." 

I will close this tiresome letter by begging of you to 
look at it occasionally, to remind you that the time draws 
near for my return to my family, " to live or starve to 
gether, as we can, for the remainder of our days ; " * but, 
until death shall relieve us of our wants, we shall ever 
cherish the most affectionate regards for you. This con 
sideration will suggest to you the expediency of giving 
me speedy intelligence of the result of your exertions on 
my behalf. 

And believe me, etc., HAR. B TT.

MY LORD : After the long lapse of years through 
which your lordship and myself have passed with the 
respective portions of happiness and misery each of us 
has experienced since the days of our juvenile friendship, 
when boarding together at Mrs. Clapham's, it will, I 
hope, be less matter of surprise than of satisfaction to 
you to learn that your old school-fellow, Blennerhassett, 
though hitherto silent, now takes the first opportunity of 
soliciting a revival of friendly intercourse by proposing a 
correspondence which may enable him to testify the acute 

* An expression in one of Mrs. B.'s letters to himself. 
sense he has of the injuries which have so largely been 
unaccountably suffered to undermine your lordship's 
fame and just rights, in which no one has yet antici 
pated him in standing forward to vindicate. 

It is only since my late return from America, after an 
absence of near thirty years, that I have bee^n given to 
understand your lordship has, during so many years, 
been the victim of so much malice and self-interest, with 
out the aid of a protecting arm, to turn aside those of 
the moral assassins that have beset your fame, that they 
might thereby divest you of your property. Tow, to 
grapple with the ruffians, and oust them of whatever con 
trol they may have usurped over your mind and estate, I 
tender you, under the guarantee of our juvenile friend 
ships, my services as an experienced barrister, together 
with those offices of friendship which I am disposed to 
think you might require and return iji circumstances not 
incompatible with our respective stations in life. 

But I forbear troubling you with any thing like stipu 
lation, unless called upon to do so, after having proved 
the success of the efforts I would make to deserve your 
confidence, which, in the first instance, I may, in some 
degree, appreciate from the tenor of your answer. 

If I should join your lordship's society, I would ob 
serve, my habits are those of a literary man, though I 
easily accommodate myself to any mode of life, and am 
no less than I was in boyhood, an enthusiast in music, in 
which I have become a proficient. Your speedy answer 
will be anxiously looked for by, my Lord, 
Yours most faithfully, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Your letter, conveying the melan 
choly tidings of our much-lamented Admiral's death, not 
unexpected, should have been answered sooner if the 
state of my mind had not made me dread that my writing might grieve you more than my silence. But I am 
now more tranquil, and am at a loss for appropriate 
words of condolence. Tell my aunt Mary that I deeply 
sympathize with her in her great affliction, and that the 
image of those virtues which shone forth in her noble 
husband's character are as fresh in my recollection as 
though I had seen him but yesterday. I sincerely hope, 
if you have not already, that you may prevail on my 
aunt Avis to remain near her sister, as this will be, for a time at least, her only consolation. 

You can not surely remain from us forever. It would 
have been better that you had not elated me with the 
hope of prosperity ; but my disappointment is over now, 
and I can even console you. Our noble friend Rossiter 
wishes for nothing so much as joining you again in business, of which he has more than he can attend to, and 
only forbears taking a partner in hopes of your return. 
I moved the day before yesterday into an excellent house, 
at 25 rent. It is the oie you may recollect, constructed 
of stone, in the rear of the house in which we lived. 

I am quite fatigued in body and mind ; the latter, as 
you know, always weak ; yet it has achieved more than 
you would credit, did you know all.* But I will soon 
write again, and hope the April packet can not be far off. 
In the mean time, do 'nt be discouraged ; we may yet do 
well here in a moderate way ; and what more, at our time 
of life, is necessary ? As to your keeping a school, it is 
nonsense (pardon the expression) ; we shall never be 
driven to this ; and here, even if we were starving, it 
would be impossible. My six bank shares are untouched 
yet ; and if you return, or should send me 25, may so 
remain for a long time. I have a comfortable house, furnished as w^ell as my necessities require ; and, with the 
assistance of a good maid-servant, get along comfortably. 
In short, therefore, be easy about me on every account 
but one, your continued absence ; this it is that breaks my 
heart ; and if it is suffered to continue, I may not last 
long. Thank ISTevison for me ; certainly, should I die, he 
shall have Lewis, now my only comfort. 

The boys are well ; Lewis progresses rapidly at school ; 
but, alas ! Harman is doing nothing but indulging him 
self in miscellaneous reading, and performing occasional 
errands. He says, on your return, he will go to the Southern States and teach. I have written to poor Dominick, 
but have received nothing from, or heard nothing of, him 
since last August, at which time he accompanied the 
troops to the head of the Mississippi. This is, indeed, a 
sad scroll ; do n't show it to any one. When I began it, 
I was calm, and thought I was brave ; but the subjects that have constantly recurred have overcome me, and I 
am compelled to conclude. When I recover myself, which 
I hope will be in a few days, I shall commence a long sheet 
that will prove far more acceptable. 
God bless and preserve you ! prays 

YOUR AFFECTIONATE WlFE.

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Could I believe in the flattering 
hope of your embarking to return to us on the 1st of 
April, any answer to your welcome letter of the 1st and 
3d of May would be useless ; but, alas ! such and so mul 
tiplied have been my cruel disappointments on this score, 
that, until I see you, I shall almost despair of our ever 
meeting again. I look for letter after letter, still hoping 
the next I receive will end my doubts ; but every one that 
arrives only adds to my perplexity. 

If my last two have reached you, my riddle, as you call 
it, has been solved ; and, what is of more importance, you 
have an outline of a plan by which, if we can not live in 
affluence, we may yet subsist with independence here. 

All those little attentions paid me at first by many of 
the citizens of this community, seemed to have been with 
drawn, until the publication of my book, which, in a few 
instances, excited a renewal of them, and which I rejected ; 
holding it better to live in solitude than again subject my 
self to the capriciousness of those to whom T feel myself 
superior. The author of " The Widow of the Rock, and other Poems," * will, therefore, receive no favor which was 
withheld from " Mrs. Blennerhassett." I live in utter solitude ; but such has been the state of my health and spirits 
for some time past, that any society would have been in supportable. 

I rely on none of the prospects of your advancement 
you mention, save the poor chance there may be of a 
recommendation to a new Governor, if Dalhousie, who 
has gone home with his family, does not return. The 
papers say, but this is only conjecture, that he is to go 
out to India, and that both a civil and military governor 
will be sent to Canada. Heaven only knows how this 
may be; but, notwithstanding all the fuss a few toadeaters made at his departure, the general impression seems 
to be, that he is a poor creature ; while the Canadian 
party can't tolerate him. 

I exceedingly dislike this place, but do not know 
where I can be better suited ; for, as to Portugal or its 
dependencies, I turn from them in horror ; such is the 
state of that country, the success might prove our destruction. "Where there is no principle, and parties constantly 
changing, what can the fallen expect but death or im 
prisonment? Though the climate of Brazil may be fine, 
in what situation would any appointment leave you there 
if, as would certainly be the case, the Government did 
not duly pay the salary ? It would be better to commit 
suicide at once, in my opinion, than to go to any other 
Portuguese colony; and as to having any thing to do 
with the Church, that would be running into the lion's 
mouth. If any employment could he obtained under an 
English nobleman, it would be desirable, even though I 
should be doomed to seek a retreat in the Welsh mount 
ains, which I should much prefer to Scotland. But I 
expect nothing from this scheme, and again repeat, that 
I fear it is here alone we can hope to end our days without 
starvation. 

! I ask myself a thousand times what I can have 
done to deserve my present forlorn condition ? Did it 
spring from the grave, I could bear it as the lot of mor 
tality. But to be a wife and the mother of two grown 
sons, and yet feel alone in the world, is a situation which 
I sometimes wonder that I can sustain ; yet, poor Dominick, in the midst of his failings, was ever kind to me, 
and now that a year has elapsed without having heard 
from him, bears more sadly upon my heart than any thing else. 

You can't remain much longer from, your affectionate wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT.

COTTAGE CRESCENT, June 25th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1825">1825</a>. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : From the generous interest I know 
you feel in the success of my proposed plan of undertak
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> publication of the poems was never effected. The address opens 
as follows : 

" From Chimborazo's lofty brow, 

Fame spreads her eagle wings for flight; 
A hero's name she echoes now, 

To thrill the soul with wild delight. 

" On Andes' peaks thy deeds now shine ; 
In Quito's halls are joy and mirth; 
Lov'd Erin's cause, for ever thine, 

Is linked with Freedom's 'round the earth. 

" Colombia now no more shall hear 
The soul's sad echo of distress; 
The tyrant's scourge no more shall fear, 
While BOLIVAR and THEE they bless. 

" Why weeps poor Erin thus in need 

Of souls like thine to soothe her tears ? 
Why not at FREEDOM'S call we speed 
To worship at the throne she rears?"ing the instruction of two or three other lads concur 
rently with that of my son, you have ere now expected 
something in the nature of a prospectus to be submitted 
to your consideration. I shall now offer you a sketch of 
my views, in the hope of your favoring me with your un 
reserved judgment on the subject. 

Having, by my own experience and observation, fully 
proven the wasteful expense of time, money and constitution, to obtain school and academical instruction, and its 
defects, when acquired, I have no reason to regret that 
my present restricted circumstances determine me to dis 
pense, proprid persond, to my son that discipline of the 
head and heart, which I should despair of his attaining 
in a public seminary ; and which, for a reasonable com 
pensation, I would administer to a few others of similar 
age and amiable tempers. 

It would be with me a sine qua non that the best moral 
principles had been confirmed, and the temper generous 
and tractable, in any pupil I would undertake; such 
preliminary qualifications I can vouch for in Mr. Cresser 
and my own boy. With such dispositions I would 
keep up rather a companionable than a magisterial in 
tercourse. Expecting to receive them with good moral 
instincts, I should spare no pains to arrange and eluci 
date the analysis, as well as the synthesis of their ethics, 
which I regard as the best and most solid foundation 
of all the prosperity they may aim to attain, in whatever 
vocation they may be destined for. 

As to literary acquirements, the course and compass of 
them should be regulated by the profession we have in 
view ; for instance, I should hold it preposterous for a 
40 
student of law to pore longer over the intricacies of 
mathematics than was necessary to enable him to apply 
them to an elementary course of physics. This I put as 
an example of the vigilance I would exert in the economy 
of time in the selection of matter. Meanwhile I should 
never lose sight of the necessary grounding, so frequently 
disregarded or neglected at all schools, except, perhaps, 
the Royal Foundations, in which last, I admit, young men 
acquire hy seven or eight years labor, a good grammar 
of the dead languages, with little or no love for the beau 
ties of the ancients, in the study of whom they are solely 
devoted to the almost total neglect of all other acquirements. I can aver that, of the four hundred boys at 
Westminster school, when I was there, six could not be 
picked out who could deliver the principles of an operation in the Rule of Three. Such a waste of young life 
was more compatible with a monastic age than with the 
present. But the tyranny of fashion further exacts four 
years more of the flower of youth to be devoted to the 
college course ; for what benefit I know not, save so far 
as it may be requisite for a more respectable ordination ; 
but with what effects it visits the constitution and morals 
of its students, I suppose, is as generally felt and admitted, 
as is the great charge for the name, rather than the sub 
stance of any learning that is gained by it. The literary 
men of Alma Mater are really self-taught products of a 
second closet education, and only regard her as their 
boarding dame. Hence I propose, for my son, to dis 
pense with a public education, feeling as I do, that if God 
Almighty vouches health to me for three years to come, 
T shall in that time provide him with a viaticum for pursuing his journey toward the attainment, with credit, of 
whatever profession circumstances and his talents may 
best indicate. In three years, I beg to repeat, for any lad 
no less advanced than Lewis, I could supersede the necessity of all school and University education, and fit him 
for such a course of study as in five years more would 
enable him to enter on the practice of any of the liberal 
professions as well gifted and qualified as any University 
scholar whatever. 

You perceive my plan, in the whole, embraces a period 
of eight years, of which the last five are to be appropri 
ated to a mixed course of the sciences, polite literature 
and professional study, to be arranged and digested on a 
scale adapted to the views, interests and intended vocation of the individual. For instance, should the bar be 
his object, he is to spend half of his last year in a special 
pleader's oflice, three months of it in an attorney's, and 
the other three in a conveyancer's office, having, during 
the last five years, kept all his Terms at the Temple. 
For a military, naval or commercial calling, I would not 
undertake to propose further than by the first three years' 
course, which would embrace enough of French, Greek, 
Latin, English, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geography, Geom 
etry, Astronomy, and no more than I should deem requi 
site at the present day for any condition. Any other 
acquirements should be sought out in an after period by 
the individual. 

If boarding should be required, it could be procured at 
Cottage Crescent, by all com<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>ons the most healthful 
and pleasant situation, distant one and three-fourth miles 
from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=bath" rel="city">Bath</a>, at the lowest terms it could be furnished in a 
good family. The tone of the society and manners is 
such as may he expected in a domestic circle whose limits 
regard as their center a retired hamster, who is an LL. B., 
has traveled much, and practiced his profession with rep 
utation both in Europe and America. It is not, he flat 
ters himself, his least recommendation, that he avers he 
had no wish to grow rich by his labors in the decline of 
his life. His only aim is to give ample value for quantum 
meruitj while, by benefiting others, he can enlarge the 
rational comforts of his own family. In his estimates, 
which, however, he is willing to modify at your suggestion, he submits, that he ought to receive 100 per annum, 
independent of boarding. If it should be thought I have 
spoken less reverently than I thought to have done, I 
would refer to the bill now before Parliament, constituting a Police System for the Universities. 

Yours faithfully, H. BLENNERHASSETT.

MY LORD : If any subject of these realms may more 
gratefully than another be supposed to exult in the 
glories of the illustrious house of "Wellesley, your Excellency will not doubt the sincerity of that devotedness 
with which an humble relation of that house now ven 
tures to solicit your Excellency's notice and protection. 

The grandson of Conway Bleunerhassett, who married 
Elizabeth liarman, daughter of Margaret Welleeley, who 
married Wentworth Harman, I trust the degree of con 
sanguinity which I happily derive from this descent may 
qualify me to aspire to the hope of your Excellency's 
favor, if, upon investigation of my capacity and charac 
ter, I shall be found worthy of it. 

I am of the Irish bar, since 1790 : left it for America, 
in 1795, where I have resided until I finally returned, last 
year, from Canada, to lay claim, at the solicitation of some 
friends, to certain estates of the late Dean Harman, which, 
it was confidently but erroneously believed, I was entitled 
to, in virtue of my descent from Wentworth Harman. The 
failure of this enterprise, consequent upon a long train of 
adverse circumstances, now reduces me to resort to the 
forlorn hope of praying your Excellency to locate me in 
any civil situation in Ireland, the stipend whereof may 
enable me to support a family in a state above penury. 

Confined, since my return to England, by an attendance 
on an aged sister, in feeble health, which has hitherto pre 
vented my personally paying my respects to your Excel 
lency, I beg to avail myself of this occasion to express 
my most ardent wishes for the most perfect happiness of 
that union resulting from your Excellency's late nuptials 
with a lady whose acquaintance Mrs. Blennerhassett is 
proud to recollect she made some years since at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. 

With the most profound esteem and admiring sense of 
those virtues and talents that distinguish, as they have 
prepared for history, your Excellency's character and 
fame, I pray to he considered, my lord, 
Your most humhle servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

SIR : I am exceedingly sorry that it is wholly out of 
my power to be of the smallest use to you in the publication of your musical composition. The New Monthly 
never inserts pieces of music, and I have no personal acquaintance either with Mr. Braham or Mr. Sapio. The 
words are not mine, to the best of my recollection ; but I 
should not be ashamed of them. I am therefore obliged 
to return your MSS., and with best wishes I remain, 
Your most obedient servant,

ST. AUBIN, JERSEY, May 31s, 1827. 

MY LORD: With what feelings I participated in the 
general satisfaction expressed by the better part of the 
public on the triumphant establishment of the present 
Administration since your Lordship's acceptance of office 
in it, the correspondence I have been honored with by 
you, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1819">1819</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1823">1823</a>, will more fully attest than I could 
by any assurances. 

I hope that, in inditing this letter, I shall not have ob 
truded upon the indulgence which has always heard and 
answered me. Encouraged by such reflections, I now 
beg leave to state, that my chief motive for this address 
is an anxious desire to offer to your Lordship's consideraation certain suggestions relating to our cannon and 
musketry in proposals for improvements in fabricating 
cannon, by which a 24-pounder, for instance, may be 
made of higher proof, and of half the weight, and at 
nearly one-half the cost of the present pieces of the 
same caliber. If this can be realized, of which I have 
no doubt whatever, though the plan was rejected by a 
committee appointed to examine it in the Duke of "Wel 
lington's Administration, who were assuredly mistaken, 
both as to the facts and principles on which the plan is 
founded, what an accession of effect and saving will be 
gained in naval as well as military projectiles, your judgment will not fail to discover. The expense, however, of 
an experiment to settle the question would hardly cost 
Government 100. 

The second proposal has for its object the means of 
giving to the musket now in use all the precision and 
effect of the rifle, without any alteration of the piece 
whatsoever, and also without lessening or at all interfering with the present rate of time taken up in loading. 
The object is effected by a new mode of making the 
balls, and which is also more speedy and economical than 
the present. The success of this improvement on the 
effect of the musket is unquestionable, and has received 
the approbation of several military men, to whom it has 
been proposed. 

During my retirement from Canada, residing here with 
my family on a small income, I have abandoned all views 
of resuming law-practice, unless in an official situation 
befitting a barrister of 1790. Any civil appointment, 
however, in your Lordship's department, at a European 
station, that could be conveniently offered me ; or one in 
Europe or America for a deserving son, or a present or 
future vacancy, would be most gratefully accepted. 
I pray to be informed, whether I may or may not ad 
dress you officially, tendering the foregoing proposals, for 
lessening the cost and increasing the effect of ordnance 
and musketry for the advancement of her Majesty's 
service. I have the honor to be, etc., 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

REPLY. 

OFFICE OF ORDNANCE, June 9th, 1827. 

SIR: I am directed by the Marquis of Anglesey to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 81st ult., 
and to acquaint you that his Lordship will be happy to 
receive the suggestions which you may have to offer, and 
will submit them to the consideration of the committee, 
whose province it is to examine and report upon the 
various projects brought before this department. With 
respect to your request, an appointment, Lord Anglesey 
regrets extremely, that the long list of pressing claims, 
received from his predecessor, and the very limited means 
of attending to them, will not allow his Lordship to hold 
out any expectation that it will be in his power to offer 
to your acceptance any appointment. 

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

To Harman Blennerhassett, Junior. 

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=guernsey" rel="city">Guernsey</a>, December &h, 1828. 

MY DEAR SON : On the 30th ult., my dear Harman, we 
received your letter of the 8th November. We grieve to 
learn by it that you labor under pecuniary embarrassments we can not at present relieve.

Since we had your September letter, I have heartily 
rejoiced at the station you had acquired in civil life by 
the attainment of a profession in the practice of which I 
hope and believe you will reach a standing to insure you 
a competency, if not a fortune. And with a view to 
your success I will now present a few observations to 
your consideration. 

The field of advice to a young lawyer is so large that 
it is not easy to choose on which side to enter it. I shall 
therefore only touch, as it were, upon the confines of the 
region of study, by advising you to refuse your mind to 
matters of detail in it, but seize and treasure up in mem 
ory the principles and points which you can draw from 
it for the occasion of pleading and forensic argumentation, in which your adversary may not, perhaps, be able 
to say as you can, " Condo et comparo quod mox depromere 
passim" 

Blackstone, omitting his feudal system and such other 
parts of the work as, on first reading, you can mark off 
as inapplicable to American polity and jurisprudence, 
should be your text-book. It will furnish the principles 
which will best prepare you to study those constitutions 
and laws of which you are now called upon, in some de 
gree, to direct the administration in your practice. In 
this work you ought to contemplate your vocation from 
a high post of responsibility, which the full discharge of 
duty will reward with the full meed of honor and profit. 
This sentiment will be well supported by your habitual 
principles of candor and integrity, which will secure to 
you the favor and countenance of the Court, which you 
must ever conciliate by decent humility, without servil 
ity; but it will expose you to insidious attacks of chi 
canery, in practice by your opponents, ever on the watch 
to overreach your contingent neglect of rules, orders or 
notices, which your vigilance must aid your industry to 
counteract in season. 

In your public speaking you must be no competitor for 
the palm of eloquence. Leaving others to aspire to that 
object, it must be your aim to stand before the Court on 
the facts, on which you can show the law and reason of 
your case upon solemn argument. When addressing a 
jury, or examining a witness, you must rather engage the 
feelings of the former by seeming to participate in what 
ever bias you have reason to suspect they entertain, 
whether derived from rumor or personal prejudice, as 
you must endeavor to win the confidence of the latter 
by the urbanity of your manner of interrogation, through 
which you can best throw him off his guard against your 
real purpose, until you have fixed him on one horn of a 
dilemma, from which he has no escape but in the conclu 
sions you have in view. This is, indeed, one of the evolutions of practice, requiring the greatest dexterity and 
address, but yet to be executed with more or less success 
through exercise, directed by observation and judgment, 
which time and industry will supply, but it is never to be 
obtained when marred by fits of irritability of temper, 
against which, through regard for character and true 
interest, you should ever be on your guard, through 
all trials of life, especially those of your practice. 

These observations, drawn from the sources of my own 
experience, I shall close here at present. I have forborne until now to speak of my own health. It is, for 
my time of life, good, save a paralytic affection of the left 
arm and side, which has not left me since the 28th of last 
May, when it seized me. How it may terminate I know 
not, but whenever I shall be called away from this sub 
lunary, to another, and I doubt not a better state, I shall 
not apprehend that my soul will be any thing less jocular 
there than here. That thought in the Emperor Adrian's 
soliloquy, or rather address, to his departing soul, is not 
so happily conceived as the sportive playfulness with 
which he expresses in beautiful diminutives his philo 
sophical composure, in articulo mortis a moment of trial 



" Such is a part, and a very small part, of the probationary discipline to 
which the young candidate for forensic eminence must be prepared to submit ; and if he can hold out for ten or fifteen years, his superior claims 
may begin to be known and rewarded. But success will bring no dimi 
nution of toil and self-denial. The bodily and mental labor alone of a suc 
cessful barrister's life would be sufficient, if known beforehand, to appal 
the stoutest. Besides this, it has many peculiar rubs and annoyances. 
His life is passed in a tumult of perpetual contention, and he must make 
up his sensibility to give and receive the hardest knocks. He has no choice 
of cases ; he must throw himself, heart and soul, into the most unpromising that is confided to him. He must fight pitched battles with obstreperous 
witnesses. He must have lungs to out clamor the most clamorous. He must 
make speeches without. He must keep battering for hours at a jury that he 
sees to be impregnable. He is before the public, and at the mercy of public 
opinion ; and if every nerve be not strained to the utmost to achieve what 
is impossible, the public, with its usual good nature, will attribute the fail 
ure to want of zeal or capacity in the advocate, to any thing, rather th*an 
the badness of the cause. Finally, he must appear to be sanguine, even 
after a defeat; and be prepared to tell a knavish client that has been 
beaten out of the courts of common law, that his ' is a clear case for relief 
in equity.' The man who can do all this deserves to succeed, and will succeed ; but I will not discourage my young American aspirants, that, in the 
United States, they may not ' rationally expect to arrive at eminence in 
their profession upon less rigorous conditions.' " 
so fearfully met by vulgar hearts. I am so far sunk in 
practice, through dissuetude in my Latin, that I can not 
set about a letter in that language. The lines are these : 

" Anima vagula blandula 
Hospes comesque corporis, 
Quo nunc abidis in loco? 
Palidula, frigida, stridalis, 
Nee dabis ut soles joca ! " * 

The epithet " vagula blandula " beautifully characterizes 
the departing spirit's mild nature, and its being on the 
wing to seek its resting in unknown regions ; but those 
in the last line but one are, to my taste, unhappily chosen, 
as they exhibit the soul like a vulgar ghost or specter, 
bearing about it enough of a camel covering sufficient to 
exhibit our Divine spark ! a pale, shrieking, chilled 
being, not, indeed, capable of jesting. 

Your fond father, HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.
