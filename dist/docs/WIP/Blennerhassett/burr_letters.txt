</p><p>
DEAR SIR : Your very interesting letter of the 21st of December, arrived here just after I had passed through 
this city on my way to South Carolina, and was not received until about two months after its date : the subject of it has since that time been daily in my mind. 
Independently of considerations personal to myself, I learn with the utmost pleasure that you are to be restored 
to the social and the active world. Your talents and acquirements seem to have destined you for something 
more than vegetable life, and since the first hour of our acquaintance, I have considered your seclusion as a fraud on society. 
</p><p>
The confidence you have been pleased to place in me is extremely flattering, and it would seem that there has 
been, without explanation, a sort of consent between our minds. In a matter of so much moment, and on which I 
am so imperfectly informed, it would be hazarding too much to offer advice ; yet it is due to the frankness of 
your letter, to acknowledge that I had projected, and still meditate, a speculation, precisely of the character you 
have described. It would have been submitted to your consideration in October last, if I had then the good for 
tune to find you at home. The business, however, depends, in some degree, on contingencies, not within 
my control, and will not be commenced before December or January, if ever. From this circumstance, and as the 
matter, in its present state, can not be satisfactorily explained by letter, the communication will be deferred 
until a personal interview can be had. With this view I pray to be informed of your intended movements the 
ensuing season, and in case you should visit Orleans, at what time, and at what port you may be expected on the 
Atlantic coast. But I must insist that these intimations be not permitted to interrupt the prosecution of any 
plans which you have formed for yourself no occupation which shall not take you off the continent can interfere 
with that which I may propose. You would certainly be pleased, probably charmed, with the manners and the 
society of Orleans. As a place of business, too, it offers great advantages ; most of those who style themselves 
lawyers, are become visionary speculators, or political fanatics. Mr. Brown, by avoiding these follies, has in 
spired confidence, and is growing rich. The country is deficient in the means of education, and the climate is 
thought, I believe with reason, unfriendly to children. 
</p><p>
"We shall have no war unless we should be actually invaded. Some estimate of the views and temper of our 
Government may be formed from the proceedings of the House of Representatives, with closed doors. A copy of 
that part of their journal is sent for your amusement. 
</p><p>
Accept, dear sir, assurances of the great consideration and respect with which I am, 
</p><p>
Yours obediently, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.

DEAR SIR : About the 15th of April, I wrote you from "Washington, in answer to your letter of December, 
apol&gizing, at the same time, for the lapse of so great a period between the date of your letter and that 
of my reply. For God's sake, therefore, do n't retaliate on me in this particular. My movements for the sum 
mer, as far as can now be ascertained, will be to return to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> to-morrow, to pass one month (something less) in that vicinity ; thence to <a href="/results.php?city=bedford" rel="city">Bedford</a>, in the mount 
ains of Pennsylvania, where I may remain several weeks, taking excursions to <a href="/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a>, Union Town, etc. The mountain part of my project is for the health of my 
daughter, who has just come on from South Carolina, to pass the season with me. I would take her on to your 
house, if it were not for the extreme inconvenience of re-ascending, especially with the incumbrance of a threeyear-old child. With entire respect, 
</p><p>
Your friend and obedient servant,

Address me at "<a href="/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a>. If the " city " be omitted, your letter may go to forty Washingtons with out meeting that which is intended. In case of a direct 
opportunity to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, you may address me there, to be left in the "Post-office" The former, however, is the safer mode. <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.

DEAR SIR : Owing to an absence of unexpected duration from this city, your letter of the 23d of May was not 
received until a few days ago. My daughter has gone on to <a href="/results.php?city=bedford" rel="city">Bedford</a>. My engagements in this city not permitting me to attend her, I shall follow in a few days, and 
be at your house before the 20th of August. Let me find you at home, or not far off. ,1 propose to pass two 
or three days with you. My daughter was charmed with your hospitable and friendly overture, and wished much 
to avail herself of it. This, however, will not be in her power till October, the period of my return from Kentucky, when it is probable she may. 
</p><p>
I omit, till a personal interview, a further answer to your obliging letter. 
</p><p>
Two young gentlemen of respectable connections and character, are on their way down the river, Mr. S. 
Swartwout, of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and Mr. S. Ogden, of New 
Jersey. I have desired that they would stop at your door, hand you this, and wait long enough to answer any 
inquiries you might please to make about Cis-Montane men or things. I pray that they may experience your wonted courtesy

You perceive, my dear sir, that I have made a little progress. I shall leave this to-morrow, but a detention 
of two or three days at <a href="/results.php?city=pittsburgh" rel="city">Pittsburgh</a> will not allow me the 
hope of seeing you at Belpre before the 23d or 24th. 
</p><p>
I leave here my daughter and her son, who have both greatly profited by the use of the waters, or, what is perhaps more probable, by the mountain air. She desired much to accompany me to your house, but we have compromised by my consenting that she shall meet me at 
Belpre on the 1st of October.

Yesterday, Mr. Jos. Davis, the district attorney of the United States, made an application to the federal court at 
Frankfort, for a warrant to apprehend me for treasonable practice, or on some suspicion thereof. The charge is 
not well-defined by my informant, but the substance is, " a design to attack the Spanish dominions, and thereby 
endanger the peace of the United States." How this charge was supported, I have not heard ; but absurd and 
ridiculous as it may appear, the judge has taken time until this day to consider if he should refuse to grant the 
warrant. He must expect a tornado of abuse from the W. World and some other papers. It is also probable, 
that villains enough may have been found to encounter all the perjuries which may be thought necessary to gratify malice. These things taken together, it is fair to infer, as probable, that the warrant will be granted. Unfortunately this being a proceeding on suspicion, and 
previous to any inquiry by a grand jury, no immediate trial can be had, and the object undoubtedly is to give a 
sort of sanction to the charge by this measure, in order to influence public opinion. You perceive, my dear sir, 
that this step will embarrass me in my project of the Washita settlement. I pray, however, that you will have 
no solicitude about me ; and it will afford me the highest gratification, if my friends should feel as little anxiety for 
the result as will be felt by your faithful and affectionate,

It is said that you have landed a mile below. We must all be stationary till morning. Send to me by return of this boat, Mr. Hays, with five 
hundred in twenty post notes, and fifty dollars in silver. 
</p><p>
We will endeavor to start all the heavy boats at an early hour in the morning : those below are to wait till those above shall come down. A 
gun will be fired as a signal for moving. All is well, very well, at this garrison.

I am much gratified, my dear sir, by your letter and notes. It is impossible for us to communicate freely, except through the intervention of counsel. I recommend to you to employ Mr. Randolph and Mr. Botts, and that you write a line to each of them this morning. They 
will not expect money, at least at present, and when I shall be discharged, I shall be able to furnish it. Write 
also to your friend Emmett, to come on forthwith. My trial is essentially yours; it will settle principles which 
will govern in both. The political character of Mr. Emmett will give him weight ; and it is greatly to be desired 
that a man of discernment and impartiality should witness the mode of these prosecutions and the extraordinary efforts and extraordinary means used to produce conviction, right or wrong.

SIR : Your letter of the 24th January has been some days in my hands, and I have been searching but in vain 
for something to enlighten me as to the nature of the action which you would propose to bring against Wilkins, 
etc. No objection, however, occurs to me against making the assignment you ask. When you shall inform me of

reaction on myself, it is probable I may accede to your wishes without delay, not, however, with any reservation of an interest as you have proposed.

[ON the <a rel="day origin" value="29">29th</a> of <a rel="month origin" value="7">July</a>, <a href="/results.php?year=1806" rel="origin">1806</a>, Burr had dispatched, from 
<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city origin">Philadelphia</a>, by the hands of Swartwout, to General Wilkinson, the following communication in cypher:]
</p><p>
Your letter, postmarked I3th May, is received. At length I have obtained funds, and have actually commenced. The eastern detachments from different points, and under different pretenses, will rendezvous on the 
Ohio, 1st of November. Every thing internal and external favors our views. Naval protection of England is secured. Truxton is going to Jamaica, to arrange 
with the Admiral on that station. It will meet us at the Mississippi. England, a navy of the United States, are 
ready to join, and final orders are given to my friends and followers. It will be a host of choice spirits. Wilkinson shall be second to Burr only, and Wilkinson shall dictate the rank and promotion of his officers. BURR 
will proceed westward 1st of August, never to return. With him go his daughter and grandson. The husband 
will follow in October, with a CORPS of worthies. Send, forthwith, an intelligent friend with whom Burr may 
confer. He shall return immediately with further interesting details : this is essential to harmony and concert 
of movement. Send a list of all persons known to Wilkinson west of the mountains, who could be useful, with 
a note delineating their character. By your messenger, send me four or five of the commissions of your officers, 
which you can borrow under any pretense you please. They shall be retained faithfully. Already are orders 
given to the contractor to forward six months' provision to points Wilkinson may name ; this shall not be used 
until the last moment, and then under proper injunctions. Our project, my dear friend, is brought to a point 
so long desired. Burr guarantees the result with his life and honor, with the lives, and honor, and the fortunes 
of hundreds, the best blood of our country. Burr's plan of operation is to move down rapidly, from the falls, on 
the 15th of November, with the first five hundred or one thousand men, in light boats now constructing for that 
purpose, to be at <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> between the 5th and 15th of 
December, there to meet you, there to determine whether it will be expedient, in the first instance, to seize on, or 
pass by, Baton Rouge. ... on receipt of this, send Burr an answer, .... draw on Burr for all expenses, etc. 
The people of the country to which we are going are prepared to receive us ; their agents, now with Burr, say 
that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject them to a foreign power, that, in three weeks, all will be 
settled. The gods invite us to glory and fortune; it remains to be seen whether we deserve the boon. The 
bearer of this goes express to you; he will hand a formal letter of introduction to you, from Burr ; he is 
a man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed to execute rather than project, capable of relating facts 
with fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise. He is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions 
of , and will disclose to you, as far as you inquire, and no further ; lie has imhibed a reverence for your 
character, and may be embarrassed in your presence; put him at ease, and he will satisfy you.
