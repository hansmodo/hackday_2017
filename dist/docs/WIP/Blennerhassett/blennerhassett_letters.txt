MY DEAR TOM: Although I feel that your anxiety 
and my own wishes equally urge the dispatch of this letter, yet that its end should not be altogether unattained, 
I have not only deferred beginning it since my landing on the 1st instant, but shall probably conclude with a 
date considerably distant from that with which I have commenced; for I shall sooner depend upon your rely 
ing on the chances in favor of the safe issue of my voyage, than merely send you an account of it such a 
distance as divides every thing but our hearts, unaccompanied with some account of things as they shall strike 
me in this country from time to time, which, as they will necessarily affect my interests, will, I know, on that 
account, be more than entertaining to you. As to our passage, as nothing very material happened in the course 
of it, I shall only tell you that we made it very tediously, that is, in seventy-three days from our sailing from 
Gravesend, till we landed at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. During our 
vicissitudes of calms and adverse winds, which, instead of the direct distance, compelled us to submit to a traverse sailing of, I suppose, not less than ten thousand 
miles, I was relieved from any sense whatever of confinement by the variety and awfulness of nature in the Western Ocean, and particularly in what is called the 
Florida Gulf Stream, together with the almost daily occupation of examining, and finally, when we made the 
land, correcting the dead reckoning of the ship by means of two excellent instruments, with which, among others, 
I provided myself in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> ; the one a Hadley's sextant,the other a chronometer watch, iriade by the maker to the British Board of Longitude. 
</p><p>
On first setting my foot on American soil, I was visited with sensations which I certainly never experienced in 
the old country. With any particular description of these I shall not trouble you, but while they excited 
severe regrets, as I cast my eyes back on the sea that interposed so wide a space between me and the many 
dear ties I left behind, they soon after inspired more selfish reflections to cheer me with the contemplation of so 
grand a barrier between me and the malevolence of my enemies, while it seemed, at the same time, the only 
limit of my natural and political independence. But 
these prospects, I must admit, merely dawn at present; and my expectations will not ripen under their meridian 
heat till I shall have acquired a landed property equal to that with which I have parted. 
</p><p>
The climate, as well as the voyage, which Maggie has home well, has received us kindly, and still continues to 
treat us with benignity. The situation of <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
with which I know Morse has acquainted you, save in ihe lower parts of the town, where, from its rapid 
increase in trade, and I may say, the almost insular situation of the city, the inhabitants have, for some time, 
been making new ground for docks, and building lots, with bad and filthy stuff' ; its situation, I say, is provided 
with almost every requisite to check, if not destroy, the tendency of the climate (which in spring and summer is 
damp, and suddenly and violently variable), to produce the intermittent very general here, and known by the 
name of the fever and ague, which, to all appearance, is the same complaint with the ague in Europe. But the 
severe heat generally prevalent in the months of July and August, raising the thermometer some days to 96 ; 
by its pernicious influence on the docks, and new low grounds, renders it advisable for foreigners to retire to 
the country. Principally upon this account, added to a severe handling from the musketoes, which, during our 
stay in town, used to come over from the Jersey shore, opposite to which we lodged upon the Hudson, I removed 
to this place last Saturday, where we have joined a tolerably pleasant party, chiefly of subscribers, who have 
built a handsome house, with a large room and balcony in front, of near seventy feet in length, and other apartments, containing about thirty good bed-rooms. The 
situation is pleasant and cool upon the shore, compared with the town, from which it is distant about twelve 
miles. Here we shall remain till the latter end of the month, when the heat will moderate, and I shall pass 
through Jersey on my way to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. In the 
meantime, I shall further explore this Island, having as yet, from the heat of the weather, done almost nothing 
in that way. But in two or three rides I have witnessed the general poverty of the soil which, though extremely 
shallow and sandy, exhibits a beautiful diversity of cultivated country, in the appearance of large and well 
fenced fields of cucumbers, musk and water-melons, with plenty of apple and peach orchards. The peaches, 
though no more attended to than your wildings in Kerry, have as good a flavor as the best ever produced 
at E.een. Judge then what a garden I look to in a better soil and climate. Grapes are universal, but seem totally 
neglected except for pies, though I am persuaded they might even here be brought to perfection. Indian corn 
is so much the staple of consumption on this island, that it alone is called corn, every other species of grain being 
distinguished by its proper name. The farmers, nine out of ten Dutch, or their descendants, are not only 
comfortable but rich. And though the state of agriculture among them is ridiculed by the Anglo-Americans 
for its backwardness, there is not an acre of land between this place and <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> (from the easy vent 
which the latter offers for the above-mentioned produce, with garden stuff, and perhaps a few other articles), that 
does not annually bring in from 25 to 30 of this currency, the dollar being eight shillings here. Hence 
I need scarcely tell you that land is extremely dear. I have it from good authority, that, in the back parts 
of the State, capital has been, within these five years past, uniformly doubled every two years by the purchase 
and re-sale of small lots of military lands. 
</p><p>
You remember the advantages this State possesses in being the best watered in the Union, both by nature and 
art, and, accordingly, all its waste lands are settling with surprising rapidity, chiefly from New England. These 
accounts, nevertheless, shall not, at present, seduce me into any purchases here, because the British funds have 
fallen considerably since I purchased into them, and there is now less than a twelvemonth to run of the present Presidency. 
</p><p>
It seems to be the general opinion of the few informed acquaintances I have yet been able to make (most of the 
persons to whom I am here addressed having retreated for the summer in different directions, into the country), 
that <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="">Washington</a> will not stand as candidate again, and that there will be a severe contest between the North 
and the South ; the former straining every nerve to elect Adams, the latter making equal exertions in behalf of 
Jefferson. The expected struggle is regarded by both sides with eager anxiety, while maneuvering is practiced 
by both parties to the degree even of multiplying the States. To explain this : You will probably have seen, 
by the papers, that a sixteenth State, viz., that part of the territory South-West of the Ohio, called the Tennessee country, has, in the last session of Congress, been admitted, by virtue of the amount of its population, 
into the Union. Now it is insinuated in the Northern and Middle States, where Adams is the favorite, and by 
whose preponderancy he would probably succeed, that the admission of Tennessee was obtained through a false 
census. However, this objection, whether true or not, now comes too late. The business is done. But, in order 
to effect a counterpoise, the District of Maine is to be separated from Massachusetts. So when you see this 
event also in the papers, you will know how to construe the real motives for erecting the district of Maine into a 
separate State, out of the ostensible reasons set forth for the measure. 
</p><p>
In the midst of these transactions I have had an opportunity of witnessing the attachment of both parties to the real interests of the country, though they reciprocally launch the imputations of aristocracy and democracy against each other; and the candor on the one side in allowing the superiority of<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson's</a> talents, is equalled by the honesty on the other in admit ting that Adams has done more for America than his opponent. Still, the administration of the new President, if not his election, will, in my opinion, as seems granted indeed, operate as a test of the constitution, to confound or confirm the idea in Europe, that <a href="/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="">Mr. Washington</a> is, alone, in America, the preserving cement of order and good government; and, at all events, the period will operate a crisis which I shall in prudence abide, before I settle the whole of my property on this side of the Atlantic. 
</p><p>
Upon this account, alone, I have said so much upon general politics ; from which, however, you must not 
infer that I do not see more than equal security of private property with any that can be boasted in Europe, 
where the many have nothing to lose, compared with the proprietary interest; but, in this country, there is no peasantry. 
</p><p>
In the meantime speculations of every possible sort are driven forward daily, I think, so far, unhappily, as 
they induce a species of gambling; for one-half must ever lose, at every sort of play, while the advantages of 
regular trade, being reciprocal, all parties are benefited. These speculations are commercial, properly so called 
and landed. I shall give you an example or two of each. ~No adventures in the former line have been 
more weighty or enterprising than in the article of flour. This I call a speculation, because flour is no 
natural subject of trade between America and Europe, since the latter can always raise enough for consumption; but ideas of its partial scarcity in England and 
France, during the war, have so engaged the merchant and farmer, that both have for the most part been ruined 
within these last eight months, the former on his disastrous returns at a full third below first cost, having only 
to condole with the latter still keeping his granaries shut up, for he has now no market but the home; the article having there too fallen near six dollars in the barrel. 
Hence you will not be surprised to learn the extravagant prices of the necessaries of life, and the high rates of wages, which have not yet come down in proportion to 
the wholesale fall. Men-servants still have twelve dollars a month. Masons, at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, from sixteen to twenty shillings a day ; carpenters, a shilling less, and both, in country situations, according to the distance from these cities, may be had from one to five or six shillings less. House-rent, also, still keeps up 
enormously ; a two-roomed house, according to its situation, fetching from 150 to 250 in these towns, of New 
York currency. To estimate the rate of other necessaries, I shall send you a price current, which you must 
understand hy adding ahout a third to every article for each hand through which it' passes before it reaches the 
consumer. While the above speculations in grain and flour have been going forward, latterly, with such ill 
success, others have distinguished this country. Of these the East India trade is the most considerable ; commenced 
under every disadvantage to be apprehended from the great capitals, and old companies of Europe. Yet, has it 
grown to a size that now begins to alarm men's minds, for the great draught of specie it drains from America, 
and a conviction of the inferiority, notwithstanding the cheapness of the India returns, except sugar and nankeens, compared with the linen articles of wear, which 
were more in use before from Europe. But adventure has not stopped here. Some time last summer, a Yankee, at a little town in the State of Massachusetts, learning 
the times were mortally sickly at Port au Prince, conceived a scheme of sending there a cargo of coffins. 
Those commodities were made up in nests of sizes, from the largest to those for infants ; and, that no room should " 
be lost, the inner coffin of the nest was packed with cakes of gingerbread. I have only to add, that the 
speculation turned out a capital hit, our Yankee having actually returned full freighted with the best West India 
produce, in return for his timber. Now for the land hits. These are going on every day, not only in England, but even in America, on principles 
no better than horse-jockeying. In this play, also, many fortunes are made and lost, the adventurers purchasing 
on credit, and a presumption of re-selling within a certain time their former acquisitions, at an advance equivalent 
to enable them to make good their former engagements. But they have found their calculations to exceed dread fully the capital settling this country from Europe, and 
now the paper of a Mr. Morris, of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, who, in 
the last war, had more credit than the Union altogether, is selling at 4s. 6d. in the pound, though he still continues proceeding with a house that can not cost less than 200,000. There is not one cipher too many. Hence, you'll perceive, there is yet no bankruptcy system established. Congress yet fear to cramp industry 
and enterprise in the young country for which they legislate, or to open a door to commercial fraud by any 
attempt of that sort, which, in the present state of the community, they wisely imagine would prove upon trial 
too lax or too rigid. And for my part, from the little I have yet seen, I can not but approve of their wisdom in 
leaving the creditor in a situation to see his debtor's knees begin to tremble, rather than run the risk of bringing both to the ground together. 
</p><p>
You must perceive then from what has been said, that there must be an infinity of land of every quality and 
situation in the market, and yet Congress have advertised some townships to be sold at auction next January, 
which, upon full deliberation, they have resolved shall not be put up at less than two dollars an acre. There is 
however, an increase of wealth annually flowing into the country, unequaled in the annals of any other, from 
emigrations. These I can not now exactly estimate, but their effects are visible, in the increase of settlements in 
every direction, from the Atlantic to the Ohio and Mississippi. Witness the population of Kentucky (now 
considered almost an old country), swollen to 73,677, and even of Tennessee, to 77,262. In this track I am now 
preparing to set forward, but can not say how long I shall be anywhere stationary for a month before the next 
fall, at which time, after having explored Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Miami country, concerning all of 
which you shall hear the particulars in due time. I shall return through the wilderness by Virginia, if a 
settlement does not arrest me in the way. But I must postpone for the present any further particulars of my 
route to the "West, on account of the remaining remarks I have to make on those parts of the country which I 
have seen since I began this letter, with which I am now proceeding at <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
On our return from Long Island, we were received at <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, as well by the acquaintances we made 
without as by those to whom we had introductions from England, more in a parental and brotherly way than 
in a manner you would call polite or elegant. European etiquette is not yet prevalent, or it is that which reigned 
on the other side of the water, at least half a century back, but toward the particular style of English dress, 
both sexes have made greater advances. But these matters, with the state of domestic economy, I shall 
leave for Maggie to describe. After some days stay in and about <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, we set out for Newark, in New 
Jersey. On our way two objects were conspicuously impressive in a distance of only ten miles from our 
outset. The first, a swamp, through which we passed, three miles in a direct line over a well-made new road. 
This swamp was not merely remarkable from its being the first I had seen, but from a hill of solid land, called 
Snake-hill, thickly wooded, which rises with almost perpendicular declivity to a hight in the center, that in 
an Englishman's eyes, would merit the name of a mountain. When I say that the moment you could reach the 
base of this mount, in descending toward the plain, you would find far less footing than in an Irish shaking-bog, 
Snake-hill will be regarded by you, as it has been by me, a lusus natures of no small magnitude. 
</p><p>
The next object, a production of art, was the bridge over the Hackinsack, to which may be added that over 
the Passaic river, both about three hundred yards in length, which unite neatness and strength of workmanship to an extent in timber that might well invite an European ten miles out of his road. The expense of 
erecting each of these, I conclude, from the account I have had of a similar one I have since crossed at 
Brunswick, over the Raritan, to be 30,000 Pennsylvania currency. Newark possessed sufficient attractions within 
itself to induce me to tarry there for some days ? even if I had not resolved to do so for the sake of visiting the 
Passaic Falls, about fifteen miles off the main road. 
</p><p>
Newark, if considered as a village, which it more resembles than a town, is perhaps the handsomest in the 
world. Of extent, nearly three miles ; it is seated in a plain, clear and level as a parlor floor, on the banks 
of the Passaic, in an amphitheater environed by gently swelling hills. Its Academy, Court-house, and two neat 
buildings for public worship, added to nine stages, which, besides an infinity of wagons, every day pass 
through it between <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> and <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, give an air of business and gaiety to the place. It is also the 
residence of many private families of respectability, with some of whom we were previously well enough 
acquainted to be entertained longer than we chose to remain there. Land is here, within five miles round, 
from 30 to 40 an acre, <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> currency. 
</p><p>
The Passaic Falls, as they differ, I fancy, from all, others in America, will always invite and entertain the 
naturalist. Their peculiarity arises from a fissure in the bed of the river, which is of solid rock, cleft in an 
oblique direction to a depth of eighty feet. The river meanders a considerable way in a serene current without 
a murmur, till it reaches the chasm where it falls with the majesty of thunder, and forever throws up a spray 
that, when interposed between the eye and the sun, exhibits an assemblage of rainbows of the most fantastic beauty. 
</p><p>
From Newark to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I have only to remark 
the general sandy and poor appearance of the soil through Jersey State, which, however, is regarded as 
one of the best cultivated in the Union, and this indeed appears in the large extent of its corn country, and other 
agricultural improvements which, by trimming its timber, have rendered it sufficiently champaign to have 
caused it, during the late war, to be exposed to the constant harrassings of the British. In this route I 
passed, with pleasing reflections, over the memorable grounds of Brunswick, Princeton and Trenton. At the 
latter place I crossed the Delaware, in sight of the spot where Providence, or his happy fortune, gave the President and America that confidence in the issue of the 
contest, wherein the Hessians were surprised, which, to save the country, could not have been delayed for a day. 
On this side of the Delaware industry seemed to stride, rather than to saunter, as she did, comparatiYely speaking, in the States of Jersey and <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>. Here, after 
traveling in every direction over the soil, which yet she has not deserted, you may trace her footsteps not only 
under the earth, but from thence upward through all the stages of manufacture wood has yet passed in any 
country, and iron full one-half as far as it has reached in England. Of the extent of cotton, linen and wool, 
throughout the country, I can not yet positively speak. A considerable capital has been embarked at Patterson, 
near the Passaic Falls, in the cotton line ; but it has altogether failed from a variety of causes, which, I think, 
independent of the long credits given in Europe, and the vast wilds here doomed for half a century yet to 
howl for population, will so long, at least, frustrate all attempts at adventure in the three last mentioned branches of trade. 
</p><p>
The approach to <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in this line, announces 
more a large busy city to which it leads, than any of those that surround <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>; yet, from the detail of business I have before and since seen in both, assisted by a commercial view of the continent, it is pretty apparent 
that the latter place is treading hard on the heels of the former already, and will soon step it by. At present, 
however, you see more stir at <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, more bustle 
in the streets, and far more English activity in both sexes. I inclose you a plan of the city, which, with fewer defects 
than any I know of, seems to have been conceived by Penn, upon the best principles to suit the climate, and 
provide for. the health, while it accommodates the business, of the inhabitants. So much for <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The only great person I regret not having become acquainted with is the President. He unfortunately set 
off for home two days after my arrival, which prevented my attending his leve*e ; but the day before his departure 
we were so fortunate as to be seated at church in the pew opposite to him. Adieu, my dear nephew, and believe me, Your ever affectionate uncle,

SIR : The receipt of your letter, by post, has been delayed until my return home from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. While it enables me to return my acknowledgments for the honor of your kind remembrance, it affords the opportunity of 
expressing my extreme regret that we were absent at the time of your intended visit. This disappointment can 
not be removed but by another of like condescension, which may, in some measure, compensate us for the past. 
</p><p>
The mention, sir, you have made of the attention you were pleased to give to young Mr. Harte, on my recommendation, would alone make it my duty to apologize for having obtruded upon your notice a man whose acts, as I 
have heard since he left this, have qualified him for no better situation than that of a jail. But my belief that 
he was really the son of the gentleman in Europe I took him for, which turns out to be correct, though he is discarded by his father, and the confidence and credit obtained from me, through a letter from his father, which I supposed authentic, by which I have lost four thousand dollars : these circumstances, sir, your liberality will 
regard as some ground of excuse for the liberty I had taken with you. I am now about to venture another, on 
my own account, to which I presume to request an answer at your first convenient leisure. 
</p><p>
Estimating the value of your reflections on the view you have taken of the western country, and particularly 
of Louisiana, I have thought it of great importance to obtain your sentiments to confirm or correct the irresistible attraction my friend, Mr. James Brown, assures me I should follow, to settle in his vicinity, if I would but 
visit that country. His words are, my " removal would be inevitable " an expression, truly, strong enough, when 
viewed through my regard for his friendship, and my confidence in his judgment, to endanger my repose on 
this island, where for eight years I have dreamed and hoped I should rest my bones forever. 
</p><p>
But the interests of a growing family, I feel, will summon me again into active life, to the resumption of my 
former profession of the bar, mercantile or other enterprise, if I should find an opportunity of selling or letting 
my establishment here to a gentleman who could, with out a sacrifice, give me a price by which I should not lose 
too much of the money it stands me in, say $50,000 ; or afford me a rent of $2,500, which, by proper management, it might be made to realize without paying, at the 
highest rate, half the yearly value of the extensive and numerous conveniences on the place, with a detail of 
which I forbear to trouble you, observing, merely, that there is now in good order, say two hundred acres, which, 
with twenty well-managed hands, employed in raising hemp, would afford a handsome profit. In either way, 
if I could sell or leave the place, I would move forward with a firmer confidence in any undertaking which your sagacity might open to profit and fame. 
</p><p>
Having thus advised you of my desire and motives to pursue a change of life, to engage in any thing which 
may suit my circumstances, I hope, sir, you will not regard it indelicate in me to observe to you how highly I 
should be honored in being associated with you, in any contemplated enterprise you would permit me to participate in. The amount of means I could at first come forward with would be small. You might command my services as a lawyer, or in any other way you should suggest as being most useful. I could, I have no doubt, unite 
the talents and energy of two of my particular friends, who would share in any fortune which might follow 
you. The gentlemen alluded to are Mr. Dudley Woodbridge, junior, of Marietta, and Mr. Devereux, of Baltimore, a ci de-vant general in the Irish rebel army.
</p><p>
Not presuming to know or guess at the intercourse, if any, subsisting between you and the present Government, 
but viewing the probability of a rupture with Spain, the claim for action the country will make upon your talents, 
in the event of an engagement against, or subjugation of, any of the Spanish Territories, I am disposed in the 
confidential spirit of this letter to offer you my friends, and my own services to co-operate in any contemplated 
measures in which you may embark. 
</p><p>
In making this proposition, I hope, Mr, you will feel that it flows in a conviction of your judgment and talents, 
from a quarter that ever did and always will prefer to seek fortune and fame through the call, rather than the coercion, of any government. 
</p><p>
A further development of my views would at present aggravate the trespass on your time hy this letter, too 
much prolonged, and would besides, I hope, be a guarantee of the perfect confidence you may repose in my 
integrity in any communication you may be pleased to honor me with. 
</p><p>
I shall await with much anxiety the receipt of your reply, and with warm interest in your success and prosperity, 
</p><p>
I remain, dear sir, your obliged and obedient servant,

MESSRS. Jos. S. LEWIS & Co., <a href="/results.php?city=<a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>" rel="city">PHILA.</a> : 
</p><p>
DEAR SIRS : Having found in this place a most valuable opportunity of participating with some friends of the 
first respectability and resources in the Union, in a commercial and land speculation, the prospect of effecting 
which depends on my obtaining a credit with you, or some other friends, for eight or ten thousand dollars, by 
your honoring my drafts at sixty and ninety days, I feel no hesitation in resorting to your approved friendship for 
my accommodation. In order to supply the deficit of my actual funds, under your management, in the stock, I can vouch for your receiving about one thousand pounds 
Irish on my account, in the course of twelve months. But I can at any time give security on the vast estates, 
and other property of <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Joseph Alston</a>, Esq., of South Carolina, who is absolutely exempt from all manner of 
incumbrance, and is the son-in-law of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a>. 
</p><p>
In a case of such interest and importance, which, besides in the event of my success, will not be indifferent to 
your mercantile concerns hereafter, I hope I need urge no further apology, for the first freedom of this kind I have ventured with you. 
</p><p>
I shall therefore expect your answer as soon as I can have it by post, directed to me at home ; and, in the mean time, I remain as I ever shall, dear sirs. 
</p><p>
Your faithful friend, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a> 
P. S. I can not embark on an aid short of $8,000, but $10,000 would improve the concern I look for almost doubly. <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">H. B.</a>

The road is pretty open, having been lately cut out; but I shall endeavor, by traveling a good part of the 
night, to make up for whatever indulgence of shelter or rest I may allow the horses and myself in the day. I 
find the cap the most comfortable luxury I ever traveled with, and think I can adjust a simple handkerchief about 
my head and face in a way to parry the musquitoes, or their more formidable companions the horse-flies. 
</p><p>
I have no care, I assure you, for any thing affecting myself, but through you and my boys ; could I, then, only 
be assured, that you would be as industrious to seek your recreation, and frequently shift the subject of your labors, 
as you are criminal in protracting the intervals of your sedentary occupations, that my boys would not be ever 
exposed to the sun bareheaded and barefoot, my reflections on my business, or subjects of interest or amusement would not, I protest, suffer a moment's interruption. 
Improve, then, the blessing you did not expect, for you could never find it on the Ohio, which a benignant God 
has reserved for you among strangers, in the generous regards of so many worthy families and individuals who have become your friends. Farewell !

MY DEAR WIFE : To-morrow I set out from here for 
<a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, in company with Luther Martin, who has 
pledged himself to attend, on the part of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a> and 
myself, at the Circuit Court of the United States, to sit at <a href="/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a>, on the 4th of January next, whether we shall personally appear or not, to see that all matters respecting us are properly conducted. It is probable I shall not 
regard a non-compliance on the part of Government with, not a request, but a desire, I have expressed through Rodney, the United States Attorney General, 
that they would dispense with my personal appearance until the ensuing term in September, through my wishes, in the mean time, to revisit my family and attend to my private affairs ; for the proceedings that should necessarily precede a forfeiture of the recognizance I have entered into can 
not be gone through before January, 1809. The courts of the United States sitting in Ohio only twice a year, 
namely, in the months of January and September, Harding can explain to you how two writs of scire facias must 
be returned, in case of my absence from the district, before my recognizance becomes forfeited. So that my 
present plan is to push for <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, about the middle of 
November, in company with Doctor Conimins, by way of the Ohio. Government, while they smart under the mortification arising from the issue of the proceedings at 
<a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, seem determined to pursue <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a> and myself until we cry mercy ; but the world shall first cry shame ! 
This evening I shall receive Rodney's answer to my letter, probably negativing my demand, but that will not 
affect my movements. My affairs will detain me about 
ten days in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, after a stay of two in <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>. 
I have strong expectations of putting my claims upon <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Alston</a> on a desirable footing. 
</p><p>
As to news, you may inform those most interested, particularly our esteemed friend Mr. Hunt, there will be no 
war with Britain, much less with Spain. This conclusion is not drawn merely from the President's message to Congress, but from better authority. Electioneering, secretly, is very active here on the part of Madison, Clinton and 
Monroe, for the exclusion of<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> from the next Presidency, while the efforts of others to obtain the Vice 
Presidency, establish a schism in the present party in power which exhibits a warning type of the future destinies of 
this country. Tyler left this for <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, this morning. 
I shall see him there and learn the manner in which he has obtained his discharge, which has been given him 
only verbally, by Rodney. Duane, I expect, will soon take a decided part against<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a>, because he has not 
been less awkward in tampering with letters that have passed through his hands. 
</p><p>
I hope you will keep up a rational confidence in my resources to preserve my health and spirits ; and I beseech 
you to seek continually the utmost variety and change of scene, which I so well know the happy effects of upon 
you, as the only means of restoring you to my eyes in the state I beseech God to grant I may find you. 
</p><p>
Luther Martin is certainly one of the most benevolent men alive. His heart is overflowing with the milk of 
philanthropy, which his potations may sometimes coagulate, but will never acidify. 
</p><p>
Kiss my boys for me. Your sickness has diverted my reflections from them of late ; but our preserving Providence will restore us in its own time according to our 
merits. <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">H. B.</a>

for <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, with S. Swartwout, as he had no particular desire to behold a representation of his execution. I was a little more curious ; and, notwithstanding hand 
bills were this morning scattered through the town, purporting that the execution of Judge Marshall, <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">A. Burr</a>, Luther Martin and myself would take place at Gallows Hill, at 3 o'clock this evening, I both dined and supped at 
the public table, with very large companies, here at Evans's, and am, after all, hearty and in good spirits. 
The mob was made up from the Point, but pledged their honor, which they did not violate, that they would hurt 
no person. They were followed by two troops of horse through the streets, to see they did their business orderly. 
All have dispersed at least three hours ago, it being now 11, P. M.

I start to-morrow for <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where I am sure I shall not receive such public honors.

</p><p>
MY DEAR WIFE : As I expected when I wrote last from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, this day fortnight, I have found my 
reception in this city easy and undisturbed. I have been here a week last Wednesday, having arrived the 
5th inst. I hope .you received that letter to prepare you for a just reception of the accounts that must 
reach you by the papers of a rising at <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, of which my effigy only was one of the objects. 
</p><p>
I am much teased by various causes of detention here which I can not control. The arrangement of my pecuniary claims on <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a>, and the acquisition of slaves, neither of them yet effected, are the principal. It is un 
certain still how soon I can even hope to leave this town. Many motives incite me to go round by sea, in a fine vessel, with Bollman and other agreeable passengers, to sail about the middle of next week ; for there are reasons why I should not even appear at Marietta, though so many demands call thither. But I yet think that will be my course. I receive the most friendly attentions from my friends, the Lewises, and others. 
</p><p>
To-morrow I dine with Mr. Pollock, a gentleman of fortune and great respectability, where <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Col. Burr</a> has taken up his quarters. I wonder you have not yet drawn upon J. S. Lewis, for any sum not exceeding $500, 
through Harding. I am at a loss to conceive what you have resorted to, particularly as you call upon me, in your 
most welcome letter of 28th September, to direct the disposition of about 1,200 you expected to receive on your 
negro speculation. My only wish is that you should apply the money to your own occasions, calling to the aid 
of your judgment the advice of that excellent friend whom you will one day further discover I have justly 
appreciated. Butler, who is now here, made me very unhappy, by telling me he left him very sick, and I sincerely sighed to be at his bedside. 
</p><p>
A large fund of stoicism will be necessary to support the want of letters from you till we meet ; for I suppose 
you have, according to directions long since given you, ceased to write ; and it would be impossible to instruct 
you how to direct to me, my change of place will be so variable. 
</p><p>
We have to-day a heavy fall of snow here, and I fear I shall not be able to take water on the Ohio before it 
breaks up. This, with other considerations, lends much to determine me upon the voyage by sea to New Orleans. But I can not make up my mind until I again see D. Commins, whom I hourly expect here from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, with whom I must endeavor to procure some negroes, or by some other means, as I can not think of returning without some new ones, or at least our old ones from Ohio. 
</p><p>
I live here at the Mansion House Hotel, late Bingham's, in Third Street, kept by an Englishman in the best style I have yet seen in America. My expenses are 
heavier than I wish, on every account, but I have become so public a character, any thing tending to shabbiness or 
obscurity would bring discredit upon you, to avoid which I know you would prefer a larger share of future sacrifices. The company are genteel and numerous, principally foreigners, and not a Democrat in thirty, the general number at the house. 
</p><p>
My silence on your recovery and the health of the boys arises from inability to express my joy and thanksgiving 
to God. But I beseech you to seek the utmost change of company and occupation. Nothing can better insure my 
hopes of finding you re-established in your constitution ; and every day's experience convinces me of the wisdom 
and facility of not only mitigating the ills of life, by resolving to contemn their mischief, but even of our 
capability to be happy in spite of them. Without disappointing contrary conclusions you would draw from our 
separation, I could give you many examples, during my reverses, since I left you; but you will hereafter find 
them with more satisfaction in my notes. I shall only add, that you should never forget that a steady pursuit 
of gaiety will prove the best prescription for the longest enjoyment of the summer season, and prepare the largest 
and most serene autumn of life. We have prospects already opened to you that beckon us to wealth and 
repose; if they should prove delusive, our piety and moderation will insure tranquillity. 
</p><p>
I am much at a loss to know how to buy any thing here for you. I shall, however, procure some things. I 
have rigged myself out in consideration of the extravagant prices of things at <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a> ; and have not forgotten the boys' shoes, though God knows when they will get them, and I can, badly guess the sizes. I could tell you a 
good deal .of what might pass for news with you, but it is not worth while, and could not find room here. I 
must not refuse, however, to mention that I have heard here young Michael de Courcy is married to a rich lady 
in England, and has a child or two. The Admiral's daughter is married to a Captain Dashwood, of the Navy. 
I learned no other particulars of the family. Wilkinson, I hear, has taken passage from <a href="/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a> for New Orleans, contrary to every expectation I could form, which 
I mention as a circumstance, if true, not quite indifferent to my future tranquillity on the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
You forgot to put Kitty Percy's, and your own, hair into your letter, with the boys' drawings. The disappointment, I hope, has not arisen from my knowing how 
to prize both. How happy I should feel, hereafter, in the pleasure Miss P. might enjoy, and confer upon us, by 
making a trip with us to Europe. <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a> has given notice 
to the Marshal. of Virginia, to be prepared with a guard 
of gentlemen at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, to conduct him from thence, 
on the 16th of next month, to <a href="/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a> ; but some in 
tervention or other, I apprehend, will prevent that journey. Harding will smile at this ; but let him mourn 
over the misery of talents without strength of nerve or energy of character, which have only shone to consume 
the fame of the Chief Justice, who has disappointed every lawyer and friend he possessed, and may possibly 
fall a sacrifice to the mob government of the day, for attempting to stroke, while he should have muzzled, the tiger of Democracy. Remind H g continually of my attachment; and assure the Scotts, Major Trask, and all other friends, of my warm regards. War direct with Britain is even yet the dread of the Democrats ; but should it happen in six months afterward, down fall<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and company.

</p><p>
SIR : I have reflected, with much concern, on an observation which fell from you yesterday ; namely, that 
my account was not a small one, and that you had not yet examined it. You may recollect, when I presented it to 
you at <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, I told you I had vouchers for most of the items it contained ; to which I will now add, that I can substantiate the whole, whenever it may become necessary ; and, on receiving it from me, you said you were 
satisfied it was correct, and wanted to see no vouchers. If I have misunderstood you, on either of these occasions, 
I shall expect to hear from you in the course of this evening, with a statement of your objections, if any, to my charges. 
The exact amount of my demand, on account of my indorsement of the bills upon which I have been sued by 
Miller, I can not immediately ascertain. I believe the damages are 10, chargeable with interest, as well as the principal, from the time the bill was returned. 
</p><p>
In the close of the late interesting intercourse that has so long subsisted between us, you must perceive, sir, I 
feel myself released from the performance of an offer I made you of introductory letters to the Lords Elgin, 
Courtenay and Sackville. I feel that I could not solicit their attentions to you as my friend ; and I should wish to decline doing so on any other grounds. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with all respect and consideration, your obedient servant, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a>.

</p><p>
SIR : As a letter from me, after so long a suspension of our correspondence, will probably be as little welcome 
as expected, I anticipate, on inditing it, only such attention on your part to its object as your reflections may 
deem consonant to your interest. I proceed accordingly, without further preamble, to apprise you, that having 
long since despaired of all indemnity from <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> for 
my losses, by the confederacy in which I was associated with you and him, I count upon a partial reimbursement 
from you upon grounds and motives which it is the object of this letter to develop and recall to your recollection. Having mentioned <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a>, I wish you, sir, to observe, that I shall never more consider a reference to 
his honor, good faith, or resources in any other light than as a scandal to any man offering it who is not already 
sunk as low as himself. You will therefore feel, I hope, as little disposed to speak, at this day, of his intentions 
as of his means to indemnify his friends. It is on you, sir, that as regards myself, devolves this duty. The 
heroic offer you made to co-operate with your person and fortune in our common enterprise, gave you, in my estimation, a color of claim to that succession in empire you 
boasted you would win by better titles your deeds of merit in council or the field. For examples of these 
exploits, I anxiously invoked the season of their achievement; but I confess, sir, I attached a more interesting 
value to the tender you so nobly pledged of your whole property to forward and support our expedition, together 
with your special assurances to me of reimbursement for all contingent losses of a pecuniary nature I might individually suffer. These considerations, sir, as they involved me on your responsibility, naturally refer me to you for the acquittal of it, and possessing such ample 
powers to discharge it, I flatter myself I shall be able to induce you to the full exercise of them. To this end I 
now apprise you, that the period has arrived in which I feel myself warranted to tell you, that in virtue of your 
oral and written assurances to guarantee me against all injuries to my property by reason of my participation 
in the confederacy of <a href="/results.php?year=1806">1806</a>, I finally determined to embark with you, and have thereby sustained damage to the amount of $50,000, of which sum I now demand $15,000, 
payable at New Orleans or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in August next. 
The respective sums you have paid already in part discharge of your written obligation, I believe, $12,500, 
together with the $15,000 now required, will leave a balance of $22,500, which you may, if you please, adjust 
by your obligation, on receipt of which, if required, I will dismiss my demand against <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> by suit in <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
Here, sir, you perceive is a demand instituted on the guarantee of the good faith of a gentleman, who can 
never plead specially thereto but out of a court of honor. Within that jurisdiction, he must acquiesce or rely on the 
general issue. Your adjusting this affair in the manner proposed, I would, at a certain period of our acquaintance, have suffered no man to question ; but the cruel, cold-blooded indifference with which you have so many 
years beheld a distressed family, in vain endeavoring to collect some fragment of the property embarked and 
wrecked in the voyage you had insured, without acquitting the debt of your guarantee such a demeanor, sir, 
naturally obliges me, as a further and final result of all my labors and deliberations that relate to you to submit 
to your reflections, other motives of action besides those already offered. These are certainly of a character and 
complexion I regret it should be my lot to exhibit to the public. To you, however, it belongs to say whether they 
shall remain shrouded within the sanctuary of your own breast, or stalk forth the heralds of the private treason and public perjury they will proclaim infallibly to the honest Democratic electors of South Carolina, who would thence remove you from the chair of their assembly with 
a different kind of zeal from that through which they placed you in it. Yes, sir, I submit it to your discretion, 
to keep concealed from your friends and from your country that led you to take part in our confederacy, which 
you pledged yourself to me to back with all your property, worth, as you stated, 200,000 guineas, to join and 
support us at !N~ew Orleans, at the head of 2,000 to 3,000 men, to leave with me, besides your oral and written guarantee of indemnity for all my losses, a private cipher, the inscrutable vehicle of our correspondence ; afterward, to commit the shabby treason of deserting from your parent by affinity, and your sovereign in expectancy ; 
and then, finally, in your -letters to your Governor, to vilify your father-in-law, and perpetrate an open perjury 
by publicly denying all privity or connection with his views or projects. Assuredly, sir, a picture of this kind, 
on which I have occasionally worked during the last four years, can not, you must imagine, be viewed by your 
Democratic friends with less horror than a death's head in a phantasmagoria ; and yet, after all my labors, I feel 
no wish to exhibit it to vindicate my character in associating with <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a> and yourself in the judgment of the mobility of the low people, or to appease the impotent 
vindictiveness of <a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel="">Mr. Jefferson</a> and his miserable partisans. The fact is, I have survived all the labors of body 
and mind imposed upon me by the evil genius of<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague kin">Burr</a>, except the remaining one of exposing both. 
</p><p>
But I must bequeath to my children and friends a memorial of that honor, loyalty and courage, to which 
you and I made our first offerings on entering into the association, but which you did not follow with me in 
the expedition ; such a remembrance, containing sketches of <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr</a>'s cabinet and correspondence with myself and other associates ; the history of my interviews and consultations with <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Mr. Alston</a>, relative to <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Mr. Burr's</a> designs upon "New Orleans and Mexico, with ample 
references to letters and other rare and original documents, that will be lodged in Charleston or <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for the inspection of the curious, the whole, sir, is now ready for the press, but shall not be sent away for publication until you shall have failed to announce your compliance with the engagements of honor herein required of you, by forwarding a credit for $15,000, payable as 
before mentioned, and accompanied with your obligation, or some other equivalent proposal, for adjusting the 
balance. Now, sir, to conclude, you may gather from what you have read, that I hold myself bound by no 
obligations of secrecy to any one who has broken faith with me, provided the disclosure work no injury to an innocent third person. That you may have full notice, I 
have no objection, in apprising you of the nature and design of the proposed publication ; but to give you an 
opportunity of keeping it out of view, by discharging the debt of honor you have contracted, whereby, in doing an act of justice, you will prevent the necessity of my 
selling to the public that detail of infamy and falsehood which you should exclusively purchase; that your past 
experience of my principles and temper will guarantee the sincerity of these sentiments, and to exemplify this 
assurance, I promise you, that whether the demand I have made upon you be complied with or not, I will, at any 
time after publishing my book, which shall be suppressed or expedited by your determination, promptly attend to 
any call you may think proper to make upon me. 
</p><p>
I have to add, that I have no doubt of my book's producing $10,000, if you do not think proper to prevent 
its appearance. Should you decide in the negative, you may rest assured I shall not, to save the trouble of smelt 
ing, abandon the ore I have extracted, with such expense of time and labor from the mines, both dark and deep, 
not, indeed, of Mexico, but of <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Alston</a>,<a href="/results.php?tla=thj" rel=""> Jefferson</a> and <a href="/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met colleague">Burr</a>. 
I send, besides the original, a duplicate and triplicate of this letter; namely, one directed to Columbia, one to 
Charleston, and the third to Georgetown. This is done with a view, by lessening the chances of my letters' miscarrying, to expedite your answer, for which I shall wait 
double the time necessary to bring it to me in the regular course of the mails.

SIR : Perceiving you seem disposed to assign to me your interest in the contract you entered into with Wilkins and Morrison, in 180G, provided "I can enlighten 
you as to the nature of the action I would bring against them," I hasten to acquaint you that I should prefer 
suing them directly, in the character of your assignees, for the amount of the advance you made to them, in bills 
rendered negotiable by my indorsement, to the contingent recovery I might obtain against them as garnishees in a suit already instituted at New Orleans. 
</p><p>
Copies of the contract, and of the receipt of "Wilkins and Morrison for $15,000, in bills, shall be forwarded to 
you, and if you think proper, without delay, to transmit me a properly authenticated assignment of all your 
claims for the above advance, and for damages on account of the non-fulfillment of the contract, I will order the 
present suit commenced against you at New Orleans to be dismissed. As your letter of the 8th ult. appears to 
have been dictated by a spirit of accommodation, permit me now, sir, to test its character by suggesting that I 
have no view " to reaction " upon you in whatever operations I may essay to obtain some indemnity for my losses. 
These, <a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Governor Alston</a> may have stated to you, I estimate at $50,000, of which his Excellency has already 
reimbursed, I believe, $12,500, and it is very probable nothing short of the publication of my book, hitherto 
postponed only by sickness, will bring me any part of the balance so long sought in vain from his honor and 
engagements. His well-earned election to the chief executive office of his State, and your return from Europe, 
will, however, now render the publication more effective than it would have been prior to these events, and it will 
be expedited within three months from this date, if all other means of indemnity fail within that period. I 
would still agree to accept from any other source $15,000, in lieu of the balance I claim of $37,500, and, of course, withhold the book, which is entitled, " A Review of the

You will now, sir, I hope, perceive distinctly upon what terms I would execute a general acquittance to 
<a href="/results.php?tla=joa" rel="">Governor Alston</a> and yourself. I have long since abandoned every chance of reimbursement from either of you, unless I should succeed in forcing the object through the 
alarms of his Excellency, or the fears and interest of other characters. I have only to add, respecting those of Wilkins and Morrison, who have pocketed the money with out a consideration, that as an action would not lie by me against them, the credit having moved from you to 
them, after it had passed from me to you, it is therefore I have applied for the assignment desired, which would 
enable me to sue them directly, which I should prefer to continuing the suit now pending against yourself. Be pleased, sir, to inform me whether Gen. Jackson is or is 
not indebted to you in a balance of $l,726 T Vu, as is stated on the face of an open account in his own hand-writing. 
While he was here with his militia, I had him summoned as a garnishee to the Circuit Court of Adams county, 
where having made default, if he does not personally appear at the next October term, I understand judgment 
will go against him for $5,000, that being the sum sworn to in the affidavit on which the attachment was issued. 
From, sir, your obedient servant,

NINE MILES ABOVE <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city origin">Natchez</a>, Sunday, <a rel="month origin" value="2">Feb</a>. <a rel="day origin" value="8">8th</a>, 6, P. M. [<a href="/results.php?year=1808" rel="origin">1808</a>]

To secure the success of the two objects of my present journey; namely, the conveyance to you of what property I could bring away from the Ohio, and the enjoyment of a few months' repose with you, I have deter mined not to yield to the hopes or fears with which I 
have approached you, by leaving my boats until Harding, to whom I have written, may advise me to venture my appearance on shore. 
</p><p>
Uncertain whether Dr. Shaw or my other enemies are yet apprised of my having failed to make my personal 
appearance at <a href="/results.php?city=chillicothe" rel="city">Chillicothe</a>, on the 4th of last month, and ignorant how far they may speculate upon whatever news they may have received from that quarter since that period, I am resolved to continue afloat, that I may, at a 
moment's warning, start with my light keel-boat, and be, in about four hours, beyond the line, about sixty miles 
below <a href="/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, whither you can follow with your family 
and effects by my flat-boat, under the care of my friend Mr. Weaver, who has traveled with me. 
</p><p>
If this arrangement takes place, I shall want one of your black men, in lieu of whom I shall leave a boy; and you will also forward to me, or bring with you, 
such letters from Grand Pre*, as can be obtained from Minor, Yidal and Mr. Dunbar. 
</p><p>
You may now privately make your way to my boat, under the guidance of Mr. Weaver or Honest Moses; one of whom will deliver you this letter. You must 
not mention my arrival to the boys or servants until I see them, or shall have left the shore. 
</p><p>
Heaven grant that I may happily embrace you in health and spirits. 
</p><p>
From your husband, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HAR. BLENNERHASSETT</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I refer you to Moses for all intelligence you may desire upon small matters.

MY DEAR DEVEREUX: After the many trying vicissitudes of fortune two old friends have undergone during nineteen years that have rolled over them since they 
received that impressing regard for you which no length of time or change of circumstances can ever efface from 
their hearts, your feelings will better suggest to you than I can describe the agreeable surprise with which we have 
just learned you are in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. 
</p><p>
Assuredly, the distance of a day's journey which separates us, can not long impede any efforts I can make to 
effect our meeting, if I shall learn by your answer that you do not expect soon to visit <a href="/results.php?city=bath" rel="city">Bath</a>, and that business is likely to detain you in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, more especially law busi 
ness, in which I could devote to your interest the best efforts of my professional labor or advice. 
</p><p>
Mrs. B., now here with my sister, is in too delicate a state of health to permit her indulging the pleasure she 
would not fail to enjoy of accompanying me to town on such an occasion. Of the deep regret which she will entertain, on conceiving the thought of not seeing you here, you will be the best judge, from the ardor of her mind 
which she lent to the best feelings of her heart in consecrating her sense of your worth and character, in the 
poetical address to you she published, last year, at Montreal, called forth on the occasion of seeing in the papers 
your intended mission from Colombia to Russia, and invindication of your character, which her best sympathies 
have covered with the segis of truth and friendship against the gorgon of calumny that would assail it. The 
volume, containing many other things that will not be uninteresting, I will transmit you by the <a href="/results.php?city=bath" rel="city">Bath</a> coach, if you do not let me take it up with me, or rather to hand it to 
you here. It has been wretchedly printed in Canada. We expect to republish it in <a href="/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>.
</p><p>
I forbear to touch upon my present condition or future prospects until we meet, and shall only add, that I shall 
be most impatient to learn whether I shall further hasten to embrace you in town, or shall soon be more gratified 
to welcome you here, where you will accept of a bed. Without the least abatement of our best sentiments, I 
doubt not you will consider us most anxious to hear from you, and believe me, my dear Devereux, 
</p><p>
Unalterably yours, <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a>.

MY DEAR DEVEREUX : Perceiving by the papers that commercial intercourse with Colombia is connived at by 
France, which I have thought it probable may have arisen from the success of your efforts on the part of 
the Republic with the French ministry ; and if I am right in this conjecture, I may rejoice in your having 
been, at least, the proximate cause of that recognition which seems so generally expected to be made by the 
French Government. Should this soon take place, surely the services you have rendered the Republic, and the 
claims you have on Bolivar, can admit of no intervention between you and the Colombian Government, notwithstanding your being a foreigner, to impede your filling any diplomatic situation in Europe you might choose to 
accept under the Republic. Might I, in such an issue of your exciting political speculations, suggest that, if your 
views are not already fixed, I will not say on some more attached, but more competent friend, I would be most 
happy to be appointed your secretary, in which character, I may venture to say, I hope my industry and acquirements would not disappoint your expectations. To this 
application you will 'gratify me with an early answer. But en attendant, if you could, without inconvenience, 
procure me a consular appointment under the Colombian Government, or any agency worth even 200 per annum, 
in any situation in Europe, such an addition to our present small income would make us comfortable any where 
near you; though, I confess, we should receive it with considerable alloy, if it were to depend on the condition of our residing out of Europe. 
</p><p>
I have nearly, but not quite, abandoned the project of resuming my profession in Ireland, which is not now the 
happy home of our " by-gone years." The scheme is beset with too many difficulties to promise success, with a detail of which I will not attempt to excite your sympathies. 
</p><p>
Mrs. B. has sanguine hopes that the suggestions I have presented to your friendship may open better prospects 
for us. She begs to close this letter ; so I will only add, I hope we shall soon learn where we may look for the happiness of embracing you ; being 
</p><p>
Ever, my dear Devereux, faithfully yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="me">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. We have just heard of a new work on the Colombian Revolution, with which we are impatient to 
meet, that we may follow the march of your fame. Apro pos de la marche, I have composed some military ones, of 
which I hope your Excellency will hereafter select one, to be enhanced by your accepting its dedication.
