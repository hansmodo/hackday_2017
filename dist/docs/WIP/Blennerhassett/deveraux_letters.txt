</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND : Your last esteemed letter I have duly received. I am both rejoiced and saddened at it. 
Rejoiced I am, that it should be my good fortune to be so kindly held in the light I see I am, by those so dear to 
me, as you and your estimable lady. I am, however, both saddened and distressed, that my affairs are not in 
that train to permit me to join you in this month, as I had fondly contemplated, and as you so much wish. 
Such is the nature of our business, that it is utterly impossible for me to wind it up at present, and this from 
new and unexpected obstacles obstacles which I shall fully explain to your satisfaction, and the satisfaction of 
our great and common friend, when we meet. 
</p><p>
How grateful and flattered do I feel, my valued sir, for the good opinion you are pleased to express and entertain 
of me. On this subject I shall only further add, that I trust I shall never disappoint you in these sentiments, 
and that I may yet have opportunities of evincing my gratitude by actions instead of words.
</p><p>
* Please present your worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett with my kindest and best respects, and assure yourself, my 
ever dear sir, of the warm attachment I shall ever feel for you, and those that belong to you. 
</p><p>
Yours most truly, <a href="/results.php?tla=jde" rel="me">J. DEVEREUX</a>. 
</p><p>
p. S. Should you see our distinguished friend shortly, recall me to him with that ardent respect and attachment which I feel for him. Don't forget.

MY DEAR AND RESPECTED SIR : This makes my second letter to you since my arrival in this country. In my former, I acknowledged with gratitude and thanks the receipt of your dear and most welcome letter from Richmond. What trials, what misfortunes, have you not undergone, and your dear and worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett 
too ! But, my friend, though great your misfortunes, what are they when compared to those which the generous and ill-fated Barry family have lately undergone ? I am really so overwhelmed with grief at the sad tidings I 
have had within these few days of that family, that I can scarcely arrange my thoughts so as to be understood. 
Only think of it, that poor Mrs. Barry, after the demise of her beloved husband in <a href="/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, hastened with her only remaining daughter to Madeira, in hopes of preserving her existence by a change of climate ; but, alas ! it was too late : she died soon after her arrival there ; and her poor mother, broken-hearted, is now left the last of her family. This melancholy and deplorable event has awakened all my woes. My dear friend, what is this life, after all ? 
</p><p>
From the trying afflictions you and your worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett have so lately experienced, I should not 
thus obtrude my griefs upon you. But they are griefs produced by the sufferings of one of the best of families, and 
who, with yours, most attract my regards of any in this world. Enough of this painful subject too painful to dwell upon. 
</p><p>
As I mentioned to you in my last letter, I perfectly agree with you in the sentiments you expressed to me 
from <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and which I have long felt, I assure you. Yes, my friend, from what is past, and from what is gone, 
never to be recalled again, I could most willingly estrange myself from this world to share a little content with you 
in any corner or in any obscurity. 
</p><p>
I have already mentioned to you that I failed in my application to this government. They will not even permit me to visit my native country. I, knowing the cause, am not surprised at it; for you must know they intercepted one of O'Connor's letters to me, about three years ago, in which he offered me a nattering rank to enter the 
French service with him. This offer, though made to aid misfortune more than rebellion, has operated very seriously against me ; and, was it not for the precaution I took previous to my leaving the United States, I might now be 
immured in the Tower. But, my dear friend, the disappointment does not now affect me; for, truly, I never cared so little as to independence in money matters as I do at this moment. 
</p><p>
Without adverting to the cause of my inquiry, I asked two or three gentlemen from about Cork as to the per 
sons you have named, but could gain no satisfactory intelligence. Had I been permitted to have gone to Ireland, I should have gone every length in tracing that subject. As I feel extremely anxious to hear from you, 
and of your estimable lady and children, I entreat you to write me as speedily as possible of your future plans, and 
where we are yet to meet. 
</p><p>
As I can not express to you, my dearest friend, what I feel, I shall end this scrawl with best wishes and regards 
to you, dear Mrs. Blennerhassett, and my young friend Dominick. 
</p><p>
Your most truly attached and distressed friend, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=jde" rel="me">J. DEVEREUX</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I do'nt mean to return to the United States immediately. There is no prospect I should think of 
the embargo's being very soon raised, unless for a more active scene of operation; and, of course, if so, there 
could he nothing to engage my attention particularly there; and by remaining here, I am more to myself 
from the sight of the world. Hoping that you will not omit writing to me by the first opportunity, I am, again, 
</p><p>
Yours, most sincerely, J. D.

</p><p>
MY DEAREST FRIEND : I know you must think it strange at not having heard from me since your arrival 
in <a href="/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and I am sure you must think it untimely 
in bidding you now farewell, to give only this paltry proof of my most affectionate regard and friendship ; yes, 
my dear <a href="/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend">Blennerhassett</a>, my thoughts have been constantly occupied in reflecting on those poignant and trying afflictions, with which it has pleased a cruel destiny to overwhelm you, and for which I feel, not as the general run of mankind, but as one, I may say without vanity, not unworthy to participate, as I really and sincerely do, in your griefs. How often have I thought of Mrs. Blennerhassett ; I feel so much for your misfortunes 
that I durst not glance at the cause of them. I am now on the eve of embarking for our loved and native country ; 
I go by the way of England, for the more safety. Permission was granted me, by the last administration, to 
return for a twelvemonth, and I now take advantage of it in the hope of recovering my former estate, which, if 
I should, I may not only be a very independent, but a rich man in this country. Should I succeed, my friend 
of which there is but little doubt you and your estimable lady shall find by my actions, instead of words, what 
I truly and sincerely feel toward you both. In the mean time, I have made a friend for you, who offers to come 
forward in a pecuniary point of view, if necessary. The person is Mr. Pierce Butler, of <a href="/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a nobleminded countryman of burs, with whom you need feel no 
scruple in calling upon in this way. The offer came, unsolicited, from himself, and he requested me to mention 
it to you. As I can not, unfortunately, at present, do more, I have nothing more to say, and conclude, my dear 
friend, with an affectionate remembrance to Mrs. Blennerhassett, 
</p><p>
Your truly attached and unalterable friend,
