PREFACE. 



IN the year 1850, the author published a small volume, enti 
tled " The Life of Blennerhassett," which has passed through 
several editions. While collecting the material for it, he learned 
of the existence of the Blennerhassett manuscripts, and made an 
ineffectual effort to secure them. They were then in the cus 
tody of B.'s invalid son, in the city of New York, who could 
not be prevailed upon to submit them to the author's inspec-' 
tipn. The latter was, consequently, compelled to send the work 
to the press, with such limited information as could be gathered 
from contemporaneous history and the personal reminiscences 
of friends. On the death of this son, in 1854, the papers 
passed into the possession of JOSEPH LEWIS BLENNERHASSETT, 
the youngest surviving child of the family, from whom they 
were obtained in the spring of 1859. 

Upon an examination, the author was gratified to find that 
his former publication, although written upon such unsatisfac- 
*tory data, so far as it professed to relate the life of Blenner 
hassett, was in every material particular correct. But the addi 
tional fund of interesting and important information which was 
disclosed particularly with reference to this most romantic epi 
sode of American history seemed to impose the necessity of an 
entire revision of his work. In the performance of this duty, 
so much new material has been added from the private mem 
oranda, journals and correspondence of Blennerhassett, that he 
has thought it advisable to change its title. Hence he has 
adopted that of " THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS ;" and so nu- 



6 PREFACE. 

merous have been the changes, that it may now be regarded as 
a separate and independent publication. 

In the selection and arrangement of the materials, .he has 
endeavored, impartially, to place before the public every im 
portant fact connected with the subject. Having no object to 
conceal the faults or infirmities, nor inclination to apologize for 
the acts, of Blennerhassett, the author has been careful to sup 
press nothing to shield him from censure, nor has he invented 
excuses to extenuate his conduct. Wherever and whenever it 
has been necessary, for the interest of the work and the inform 
ation of the reader, that the motives by which Blennerhassett 
was actuated should be disclosed, he has not hesitated to reveal 
them, even though it involved the invasion of private corres 
pondence. 

It is possible, nay, probable, that much is here presented which, 
could it have passed under the personal supervision of Mr. 
Blennerhassett, would have been materially modified, or entirely 
withheld ; particularly after time had smoothed the asperities 
of personal rancor, and obliterated the memory of private wrongs. 
But this is certainly not the province of the impartial biogra 
pher, whose paramount aim is the verity of history, and not 
the unwarranted aggrandizement of individual character. 

These remarks apply more appropriately to the observations 
on men and measures, contained in the journal and private 
correspondence of Blennerhassett. The scathing criticisms, and, 
in many instances, unmerited censure, with which its pages are 
replete, can only be extenuated by the smarting sense of per 
sonal injustice to which he deemed himself subjected. It is to 
be borne in mind, however, that none of his notes were ever 
intended for the public eye; that they were written exclusively 
for the entertainment of his wife and friends, at a time when 
party spirit ran high, and the jealous rivalries of leading poli 
ticians had discarded the amenities of social intercourse ; when 



PREFACE. 7 

Colonel Burr himself strove to give a partisan bias to the pros 
ecution for treason, by charging Mr. Jefferson with political 
malevolence and private revenge. Under such considerations, 
we are prepared, at least, to excuse the warmth of his invec 
tives, however much we may dissent from his conclusions. 
Time has demonstrated, that whatever personal inconvenience 
and sacrifice of private interest the arrest of the Burr Expedi 
tion occasioned the parties immediately involved ; whatever mo 
tives may have influenced the action of the executive in the 
prosecution of its leader, it is certainly now clear, that it main 
tained the integrity of the Union, and re-established the confi 
dence of the world in the power and perpetuity of the govern 
ment. 

The chapter devoted to the Spanish intrigues in Kentucky, 
seemed necessary to a proper understanding of the causes which 
induced, and the parties who influenced and projected, this 
noted undertaking. If the remarks upon the conduct of Gene 
ral Wilkinson should seem severe, the author can only say that 
they have been prompted through no feeling of personal en 
mity, but in justice, merely, to those who were the victims of 
his duplicity and bold breach of faith. 

He has to regret the haste with which the necessities of the 
case have compelled him to prepare the work for the press. It 
has been completed in exactly one year from the time the 
papers were submitted to his inspection, and at such intervals 
of leisure, only, as he could appropriate from the duties of an 
arduous profession. He can not, therefore, flatter himself that 
it is free from occasional errors, or that it will successfully 
escape the criticism of cultivated and correct taste. But how 
ever numerous may be its faults, he can only hope that they may 
in some measure elude detection through the interest which the 
subject itself creates.

INTRODUCTION. 



MORE than fifty years since, the inhabitants of the 
West were gratified by the intelligence that an indi 
vidual of rank and fortune ha,d renounced allegiance 
to his father-land, to take up his abode among them. 
In those primitive days, every addition to the little 
band of early pioneers was deemed of some import 
ance ; but the accession of one whose manners and 
customs differed so widely from their own, who could 
build and adorn a palace in the western wilds, was 
considered an event of wonderful magnitude. 

With satisfaction they beheld the first germs of civi 
lization springing from beneath the plastic hand of 
taste, and bursting into full maturity through the gen 
ial influence of wealth. This western Eden,' while it 
captivated their eyes with its beauty, amazed their 
minds with the resources of its possessor. They wit 
nessed the accomplishment of his ends in the subjuga 
tion of nature to his will; saw "the desert bloom and 
blossom as the rose;" stood as anxious spectators 
when the whirlwind of popular prejudice prostrated 
the hopes of his household; and wept for the desola 
tion which succeeded.. 

Since the celebrated expedition of Aaron Burr, the 
earlier fortunes of Blennerhassett have been the sub 
ject of singular curiosity. Many have ^been the sur 
mises as to the causes which led this scion of Euro- 
2 



18 INTRODUCTION. 

pean aristocracy to renounce the hereditary honors 
consequent upon family, for the secluded life of an 
unpretending republican. Some attribute it to an 
early alliance with a lady whose fortune and rank 
were unequal to those of his own; others, to a want 
of success as a member of the Irish bar; while the 
uncharitable are anxious to throw around the subject 
conjectures of the darkest character. 

The mystery which surrounds -him and his " island 
home " has served, for more than fifty years, to enter 
tain the passing traveler, as he glides by the spot 
where once stood the American Alhambra. The mar 
velous stories of Spain, of Moslem enchantment and 
Moorish gold, are scarcely less credible than the tales at 
such times repeated to the attentive ear of the listener. 

Memory reverts with fond delight to the earlier days 
of our youthful pastimes, when, strolling through the 
embowered coppices of the isle, or seated beneath the 
vine-clad cotton tree, the stern realities of life were 
forgotten, in the tragic narratives of by-gone years. 
Around the name of Blennerhassett, and every thing 
connected with it, was waved the enchanting wand of 
romance ; and tales of beauty, of splendor, and of crime, 
while they fascinated us with their witchery, startled 
us with his deep and dark designs. 

Who Blennerhassett truly was, and what his origin 
and destiny, it is our object to disclose; to strip the 
subject of that mysteriousness which ignorance, wilful 
prejudice, or a love of the marvelous has thrown 
around it, and reveal to the inquiring reader the acts 
and character of the man. 

" 



THE 



BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 



CHAPTER I. 

LITTLE of incident is anywhere related of the early 
life of Blennerhassett. He was the youngest son of a 
distinguished family, which could trace its lineage from 
the time of King John. His grandfather, Robert, 
having emigrated from Cumherland in the reign of Eli 
zabeth, became the head of three highly respectable 
branches of Irish gentry. 

The first son was the proprietor of Ballyseedy; the 
second of Conway Castle, Killorglin, both in the county 
of Kerry ; and the third established himself at Riddles- 
town, in the county of Limerick. 

The subject of this memoir was of the Castle Conway, 
or Killorglin line. He w r as born in Hampshire, on the 
8th of October, in the year 1764 or 1765, while his parents 
were on a temporary visit to England. A younger son, 
and by the laws of primogeniture, destined to a profes 
sion, he was placed by his father at an early age, in the 
celebrated school of Westminster. He was afterward

entered at Trinity College, Dublin, where it is said he 
graduated with honor to himself and credit to his pro 
fessors. 

At that time the Irish bar a body formidable to the 
then existing government comprised many sons of the 
noblemen and commoners of Ireland. The legal science 
was not then a mere trade, but a profession, requiring 
both learning and time to master its abstruse truths. 

Eloquence was looked upon as a qualification for the 
Senate, and almost every peer and commoner had a 
relative among its members. 

This inordinate preference for the legal profession is 
said to have arisen from numerous causes. Chief 
among these was the ambition of their gentry, and their 
family pride. The first anxiety of a parent was to secure 
for his son a calling befitting, in every particular, the 
dignity of the ancient name. In this respect the bar 
has at all times proved the highway to fortune and 
political preferment. But the consideration of wealth, or, 
perhaps, a seat in the Privy Council, were not the only 
inducements to such a selection. Although they were 
not to be regarded with indifference, yet there Jaas also 
been an adventitious dignity conferred upon the profes 
sion, by the political circumstances of the country, and 
the individual influence of many of its illustrious names. 
Until 1792, no Catholic could be admitted to the pri 
vileges of a barrister, and the dignities of the profession 
were confined to a favored few. The highest families 
were anxious to secure positions, which stamped an 
aristocratic character upon the importance of the calling ; 
and to be a counsellor in those days was to be no ordi-

nary personage; the title was an indisputable passport 
to aristocratic society and intellectual association. 

Blennerhassett having, therefore, selected the law as 
the surest road to preferment and wealth, was placed 
at the King's Inns, as an entered apprentice; and at 
Michaelmas term, 1790, at the age of twenty-five, was 
generally admitted into the "Honorable Society," and 
called to the degree of Barrister therein. 

Having now successfully accomplished a severe course 
of study in which, in a few years, he had passed through 
the first literary, scientific and legal institutions of Great 
Britain ; and, by the death of his eldest brother, having 
but recently succeeded to the family estates, rendering 
exertion in his profession unnecessary as a means of sub 
sistence, he determined before entering upon its duties, 
to indulge himself for a time in the recreation of foreign 
travel. 

Accordingly, in company with one of his companions, 
he set out for a tour upon the continent. France, both 
then as now, was the center of interest for all the world. 
For the philosopher, statesman, or man of pleasure, she 
has long possessed, and still presents, superior attractions 
over any of her sister Kingdoms. At the period of 
Blennerhassett's visit, she had been rocked by the whirl 
wind of revolution ; and the established despotism of her 
military monarchs had been crumbled into atoms. The 
massive structure of the Bastile, every stone of which 
echoed the groans of four centuries of oppression, had 
been torn from its summit to its foundation, by the infu 
riated advocates of popular freedom. On the anniver 
sary of its destruction, Louis Sixteenth, with thirty 



22 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

thousand delegates from the confederated National 
Guards of the kingdom, in the presence of five hun 
dred thousand of their countrymen, had taken the oath 
of fidelity to the nation, to the Constitution, and, all 
save the monarch himself, to the king. But France was 
still trembling from the convulsions of her people. Her 
recuperative energies were starting afresh, on a new sys 
tem of government, which lacked all the great elements 
of success. To one who had been familiar with the 
daily complainings of an oppressed nation, who, although 
himself but upon the verge of manhood, had already 
been strongly suspected of a secret league with the revo 
lutionary spirits of Ireland, thoroughly read in the poli 
tical writings of Voltaire, and a disciple of Kosseau, 
a more interesting and opportune period could not have 
presented itself. 

He was still an unwilling witness to the murmurs 
of the people. Confidence in the permanency of the 
government had not been secured by the affections of 
its subjects, and society had received a shock from 
which it had seemed impossible to recover. 

Having remained long enough to witness the adop 
tion of this new measure, Blennerhassett returned to 
his own country, in time to escape the storm, which 
prostrated the hopes of its friends, and destroyed the 
life of the unfortunate Louis. There were quite a 
number of the young men of Ireland in France at 
the time of the emeute. Many of them entered into 
the spirit of the Revolution with great zest, and 
endeavored to enlist the sympathies of the insurgents 
in their cause against the oppression of England. 



DISAFFECTED IRELAND. 23 

Among the more noted of these for their subsequent 
misfortunes, were John and Henry Sheares. They 
were natives of Cork, well educated, both lawyers, 
and of respectable parentage. They were present at 
the taking of the Bastile, and John was seen, on his 
return to Ireland, to flourish with exultation a hand 
kerchief stained with the blood of Louis XYI. They 
subsequently became involved in the outbreak in 
1798, for which they were prosecuted for treason. 
Although they were ably defended by Curran, they 
were, nevertheless, convicted, and suffered the extreme 
penalty of the law. Much dissatisfaction was after 
wards expressed on account of the character of the 
evidence upon which they were found guilty. There 
was but one witness, and he a government decoy, 
who had himself counseled more treason than either 
had ever conceived. 

But the same spirit of discontent which prevailed 
in France had extended to Ireland. For centuries 
had she groaned under the oppression of England. 
Her submission to the sceptres of Henry and of 
Richard had been construed into the right of con 
quest; and they sought to crush the native spirit 
of her people, by fomenting discord and exercising 
tyranny. Ireland had been blessed with a genial soil. 
Nature had lavished her brightest gifts upon her. 
The native character of her population was not infe 
rior to that of other nations. But of what avail were 
fertile fields, or gigantic intellects, when national dis 
organization and political faction perverted the gifts 
of Providence to selfish purposes, or destroyed their 



24 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

usefulness in the general wreck of distracted govern 
ments and divided subjects ? Her manufacturing inter 
est and commercial enterprise struggled long against 
the monopoly of England; but the superior power of 
her ruler enabled her to check their prosperity, by the 
heavy hand of arbitrary restraint. A deplorable want 
of union of sentiment, and firmness of purpose, at all 
times prevented a successful separation from her 
powerful oppressor; and every attempt to claim, her 
independence proved vain and abortive. 

England, fearful of her growing strength, sought to 
subdue her spirit, by onerous exactions, and denying 
her the privilege of a free legislature. Not only against 
Ireland had she exercised hef* arbitrary will, but also 
against the colonies of her planting in North America. 
Vain in the conceit of her imperial power, she dared 
to exact obedience from peoples separated by the wide 
Atlantic, and command the same submission with which 
the oppressed subjects of Ireland had yielded. "While 
her experimental philosophy had taught her that to 
retain her authority she must exercise tyranny, she had 
not reflected that there was a point in the system of her 
oppression, where submission ceased to be a virtue. 

The spirit of independence was hovering over the 
bloody altar of the American Revolution, when Ire 
land again awoke to a sense of her own condition. She 
gazed with animated delight at the increasing success of 
American arms. Every new victory found a sympathetic 
influence, responding with joy, in the recesses of her own 
bosom. The feeble colonies of America, spread over a 
vast extent of territory, with but few facilities for con-

ducting a war, with a hostile Indian enemy in their rear, 
and the boasted chivalry of England at their front; 
undismayed by difficulty or the fear of defeat, after seven 
years of war, were finally victorious. The arrogance of 
England bowed its proud head to the shrine of liberty ; 
and Lord Cornwallis, her favorite general, led back the 
relics of her conquered army, to commemorate, in the 
mother country, the impotence of her power and the 
emancipation of her colonies. 

Before they had well considered the reason of their 
solicitude, the same spirit of independence had animated 
the Irish bosom; and, in every corner of her territory, 
the fire of liberty burst forth, in a blaze that threatened 
equal destruction to British usurpation, and kingly gov 
ernment. The nation became aroused. English influ 
ence and English interests secured partizans in church 
and state ; and opposing factions, from their intolerance 
and party animosity, had already commenced the Irish 
revolution. 

. The success of the cause of liberty in the American 
colonies affected, most sensibly, the whole of Europe. 
It appeared, indeed, as though the fiat had gone forth, 
that monarchies and despotisms were for ever to cease 
from among men. " Strange and unforeseen events 
were crowding the annals of the world; the established 
axioms of general polity began to lose their weight 
among nations ; and governments, widely wandering 
from the fundamental principles of their own con 
stitutions, appeared carelessly traveling the road to 
ruin." 

Such was the State of Europe; presenting an aspect 



26 THE 'BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

not unlike that upon which we, of later days, have 
gazed (and to which we still look, with feelings of 
solicitude and hope), when Blennerhassett left the 
unhappy shores of France for those, not less discon 
tented, of his native country. 

Ireland, it is true, from the helpless situation of 
England, at a time w^hen her foreign wars and hapless 
defeats had exhausted the resources of that powerful 
nation, had successfully demanded the repeal of stat 
ute sixth of George First, entitled " An Act for the 
better securing the dependency of the kingdom of Ire 
land upon the crown of Great Britain ; " but her situa 
tion was not less distracted than before. 

Although it was difficult to keep aloof from the entan 
gling snares of party strife, Blennerhassett chose rather 
to pursue the more flowery paths of literature than the 
sterner and more rugged way of political preferment. 
To a mind which sought within itself for sources of 
enjoyment, the bustle and hurricane which reigned 
around served to distract his meditations, and inter 
rupt the pleasure which, in seclusion, he had hoped to 
find. 

j*>eing the possessor of an estate, with considerable 
additional fortune inherited at the death of his father, 
he determined no longer to remain in Ireland, subjected 
to the inconvenience and danger which usually attend 
the feuds of' faction; but, in some more remote and 
peaceful region, where the infuriated mob and the 
clamor of war were never heard, he hoped to spend a 
life of repose. 

He accordingly disposed of his lands to his relative, 



MARRIAGE AND MIGRATION. . 27 

Mr. Mullins, afterward Baron Vintry, and made immedi 
ate preparation for departing. Having closed his busi 
ness lie started for Kinsale, a seaport in the county of 
Cork, where his sister, the consort of Lord Kinsale 
(Baron de Courcey), at that time resided. 

His estates had yielded him an ample fortune of one 
hundred thousand dollars. From Kinsale he proceeded 
to England, to complete his arrangements for transmit 
ting it to America, and supplying himself with his 
necessary outfits. 

While here he frequently met with, and finally became 
affianced to, a Miss Agnew, daughter of the Lieutenant- 
Governor of the Isle of Man, and grand-daughter of the 
celebrated General of that name, who fell at the battle 
of Germantown. She was young, intelligent, and beau 
tiful. Possessed of an uncommon degree of energy, 
coupled with a temperament of romantic ardor, she lis 
tened, with captivated delight, to the fairy stories he 
repeated of the far-off land in the Western world. She 
did not, therefore, hesitate to consummate the nuptials, 
and link her destinies with his in that rural paradise 
which his imagination had so vividly depicted. 

Upon the precarious sea of life, almost without com 
pass or chart, Blennerhassett had now launched his 
adventurous barque. The sudden truth flashed across 
his mind, that he, too, was an adventurer; not, how 
ever, for the gold of Peru, for discoveries in the material 
world, or the subjugation of a foreign power. Gold 
and honor were already his ; but these, compared to the 
revelation of truth in the great volume of nature, to 
the inquiring mind, which sought to unfold her hidden - 



28 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

mysteries, were but as " sounding brass and tinkling 
cymbal." 

To him, that sea appeared serene and safe, with no 
adverse winds to interrupt his onward course ; while, 
in the dim distance of imagination, he descried that 
shore of sweet repose, where the deceit and treachery 
of man should never disturb the quietude of a mind at 
peace. 



IN AMERICA, AT LAST. 29 



CHAPTER II. 

HAVING supplied himself, in London, with an extensive 
library and a philosophical apparatus, together with 
other materials deemed necessary for future use, Blenn- 
erhassett shipped for IsTew York in 1796, where he 
remained for several months, to study the topography 
of the country and the character of its inhabitants-. 

An account of the voyage, and description of the 
country, are entertainingly given in the following letter, 
addressed to his nephew, the Hon. Thomas de Courcey,* 
afterward Lord Kinsale : 



UTRECHT, LONG ISLAND, 

August ISth, 1796. 

MY DEAR TOM: Although I feel that your anxiety 
and my own wishes equally urge the dispatch of this let 
ter, yet that its end should not be altogether unattained, 
I have not only deferred beginning it since my landing 
on the 1st instant, but shall probably conclude with a 
date considerably distant from that with which I have 
commenced; for I shall sooner depend upon your rely 
ing on the chances in favor of the safe issue of my voy 
age, than merely send you an account of it such a 
distance as divides every thing but our hearts, unaccom 
panied with some account of things as they shall strike 
me in this country from time to time, which, as they 



30 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

will necessarily affect my interests, will, I know, on that 
account, be more than entertaining to you. As to our 
passage, as nothing very material happened in the course 
of it, I shall only tell you that we made it very tediously, 
that is, in seventy-three days from our sailing from 
Gravesend, till we landed at E"ew York. During our 
vicissitudes of calms and adverse winds, which, instead 
of the direct distance, compelled us to submit to a tra- v 
verse sailing of, I suppose, not less than ten thousand 
miles, I was relieved from any sense whatever of confine 
ment by the variety and awfulness of nature in the 
Western Ocean, and particularly in what is called the 
Florida Gulf Stream, together with the almost daily 
occupation of examining, and finally, when we made the 
land, correcting the dead reckoning of the ship by means 
of two excellent instruments, with which, among others, 
I provided myself in London ; the one a Hadley's sex 
tant, the other a chronometer watch, iriade by the maker 
to the British Board of Longitude. 

On first setting my foot on American soil, I was visited 
with sensations which I certainly never experienced in 
the old country. With any particular description of 
these I shall not trouble you, but while they excited 
severe regrets, as I cast my eyes back on the sea that 
interposed so wide a space between me and the many 
dear ties I left behind, they soon after inspired more self 
ish reflections to cheer me with the contemplation of so 
grand a barrier between me and the malevolence of my 
enemies, while it seemed, at the same time, the only 
limit of my natural and political independence. But 
these prospects, I must admit, merely dawn at present ; 



NEW YORK IN '96. 31 

and* my expectations will not ripen under their meridian 
heat till I shall have acquired a landed property equal 
to that with which I have parted. 

The climate, as well as the voyage, which Maggie has 
home well, has received us kindly, and still continues to 
treat us with benignity. The situation of New York, 
with which I know Morse has acquainted you, save in 
ihe lower parts of the town, where, from its rapid 
increase in trade, and I may say, the almost insular situ 
ation of the city, the inhabitants have, for some time, 
been making new ground for docks, and building lots, 
with bad and filthy stuff' ; its situation, I say, is provided 
with almost every requisite to check, if not destroy, the 
tendency of the climate (which in spring and summer is 
damp, and suddenly and violently variable), to produce 
the intermittent very general here, and known by the 
name of the fever and ague, which, to all appearance, is 
the same complaint with the ague in Europe. But the 
severe heat generally prevalent in the months of July 
and August, raising the thermometer some days to 96 ; 
by its pernicious influence on the docks, and new low 
grounds, renders it advisable for foreigners to retire to 
the country. Principally upon this account, added to a 
severe handling from the musketoes, which, during our 
stay in town, used to come over from the Jersey shore, 
opposite to which we lodged upon the Hudson, I removed 
to this place last Saturday, where we have joined a 
tolerably pleasant party, chiefly of subscribers, who have 
built a handsome house, with a large room and balcony 
in front, of near seventy feet in length, and other apart 
ments, containing about thirty good bed-rooms. The 



32 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

situation is pleasant and cool upon the shore, compared 
with the town, from which it is distant about twelve 
miles. Here we shall remain till the latter end of the 
month, when the heat will moderate, and I shall pass 
through Jersey on my way to Philadelphia. In the 
meantime, I shall further explore this Island, having as 
yet, from the heat of the weather, done almost nothing 
in that way. But in two or three rides I have witnessed 
the general poverty of the soil which, though extremely 
shallow and sandy, exhibits a beautiful diversity of cul 
tivated country, in the appearance of large and well 
fenced fields of cucumbers, musk and water-melons, with 
plenty of apple and peach orchards. The peaches, 
though no more attended to than your wildings in 
Kerry, have as good a flavor as the best ever produced 
at E.een. Judge then what a garden I look to in a better 
soil and climate. Grapes are universal, but seem totally 
neglected except for pies, though I am persuaded they 
might even here be brought to perfection. Indian corn 
is so much the staple of consumption on this island, that 
it alone is called corn, every other species of grain being 
distinguished by its proper name. The farmers, nine 
out of ten Dutch, or their descendants, are not only 
comfortable but rich. And though the state of agri 
culture among them is ridiculed by the Anglo-Americans 
for its backwardness, there is not an acre of land 
between this place and ISTew York (from the easy vent 
which the latter offers for the above-mentioned produce, 
with garden stuff, and perhaps a few other articles), that 
does not annually bring in from 25 to 30 of this 
currency, the dollar being eight shillings here. Hence 



EARLY POLITICS. 33 

I need scarcely tell you that land is extremely dear. I 
have it from good authority, that, in the back parts 
of the State, capital has been, within these five years 
past, uniformly doubled every two years by the purchase 
and re-sale of small lots of military lands. 

You remember the advantages this State possesses in 
being the best watered in the Union, both by nature and 
art, and, accordingly, all its waste lands are settling with 
surprising rapidity, chiefly from New England. These 
accounts, nevertheless, shall not, at present, seduce me 
into any purchases here, because the British funds have 
fallen considerably since I purchased into them, and 
there is now less than a twelvemonth to run of the pres 
ent Presidency. 

It seems to be the general opinion of the few informed 
acquaintances I have yet been able to make (most of the 
persons to whom I am here addressed having retreated 
for the summer in different directions, into the country), 
that Washington will not stand as candidate again, and 
that there will be a severe contest between the North 
and the South ; the former straining every nerve to elect 
Adams, the latter making equal exertions in behalf of 
Jefferson. The expected struggle is regarded by both 
sides with eager anxiety, while maneuvering is practiced 
by both parties to the degree even of multiplying the 
States. To explain this : You will probably have seen, 
by the papers, that a sixteenth State, viz., that part of 
the territory South-West of the Ohio, called the Tennes 
see country, has, in the last session of Congress, been 
admitted, by virtue of the amount of its population, 
into the Union. Now it is insinuated in the Northern 
3 



34 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and Middle States, where Adams is the favorite, and by 
whose preponderancy he would probably succeed, that 
the admission of Tennessee was obtained through a false 
census. However, this objection, whether true or not, 
now comes too late. The business is done. But, in order 
to effect a counterpoise, the District of Maine is to be 
separated from Massachusetts. So when you see this 
event also in the papers, you will know how to construe 
the real motives for erecting the district of Maine into a 
separate State, out of the ostensible reasons set forth for 
the measure. 

In the midst of these transactions I have had an 
opportunity of witnessing the attachment of both par 
ties to the real interests of the country, though they 
reciprocally launch the imputations of aristocracy and 
democracy against each other; and the candor on the 
one side in allowing the superiority of Jefferson's tal 
ents, is equalled by the honesty on the other in admit 
ting that Adams has done more for America than his 
opponent. Still, the administration of the new Presi 
dent, if not his election, will, in my opinion, as seems 
granted indeed, operate as a test of the constitution, to 
confound or confirm the idea in Europe, that Mr. Wash 
ington is, alone, in America, the preserving cement of 
order and good government; and, at all events, the 
period will operate a crisis which I shall in prudence 
abide, before I settle the whole of my property on this 
side of the Atlantic. 

Upon this account, alone, I have said so much upon 
general politics ; from which, however, you must not 
infer that I do not see more than equal security of pri- 



EARLY TRADE. 35 

vate property with any that can be boasted in Europe, 
where the many have nothing to lose, compared with 
the proprietary interest; but, in this country, there is 
no peasantry. 

In the meantime speculations of every possible sort 
are driven forward daily, I think, so far, unhappily, as 
they induce a species of gambling; for one-half must 
ever lose, at every sort of play, while the advantages of 
regular trade, being reciprocal, all parties are benefited. 
These speculations are commercial, properly so called 
and landed. I shall give you an example or two of 
each. ~No adventures in the former line have been 
more weighty or enterprising than in the article of 
flour. This I call a speculation, because flour is no 
natural subject of trade between America and Europe, 
since the latter can always raise enough for consump 
tion; but ideas of its partial scarcity in England and 
France, during the war, have so engaged the merchant 
and farmer, that both have for the most part been ruined 
within these last eight months, the former on his disas 
trous returns at a full third below first cost, having only 
to condole with the latter still keeping his granaries shut 
up, for he has now no market but the home; the arti 
cle having there too fallen near six dollars in the barrel. 
Hence you will not be surprised to learn the extravagant 
prices of the necessaries of life, and the high rates of 
wages, which have not yet come down in proportion to 
the wholesale fall. Men-servants still have twelve dol 
lars a month. Masons, at New York and Philadelphia, 
from sixteen to twenty shillings a day ; carpenters, a shil 
ling less, and both, in country situations, according to 



36 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the distance from these cities, may be had from one to 
five or six shillings less. House-rent, also, still keeps up 
enormously ; a two-roomed house, according to its situa 
tion, fetching from 150 to 250 in these towns, of New 
York currency. To estimate the rate of other necessa 
ries, I shall send you a price current, which you must 
understand hy adding ahout a third to every article for 
each hand through which it' passes before it reaches the 
consumer. While the above speculations in grain and 
flour have been going forward, latterly, with such ill 
success, others have distinguished this country. Of these 
the East India trade is the most considerable ; commenced 
under every disadvantage to be apprehended from the 
great capitals, and old companies of Europe. Yet, has it 
grown to a size that now begins to alarm men's minds, 
for the great draught of specie it drains from America, 
and a conviction of the inferiority, notwithstanding the 
cheapness of the India returns, except sugar and nan 
keens, compared with the linen articles of wear, which 
were more in use before from Europe. But adventure 
has not stopped here. Some time last summer, a Yankee, 
at a little town in the State of Massachusetts, learning 
the times were mortally sickly at Port au Prince, con 
ceived a scheme of sending there a cargo of coffins. 
Those commodities were made up in nests of sizes, from 
the largest to those for infants ; and, that no room should " 
be lost, the inner coffin of the nest was packed with 
cakes of gingerbread. I have only to add, that the 
speculation turned out a capital hit, our Yankee having 
actually returned full freighted with the best West India 
produce, in return for his timber. 



LAND SPECULATIONS. 37 

Now for the land hits. These are going on every day, 
not only in England, but even in America, on principles 
no better than horse-jockeying. In this play, also, many 
fortunes are made and lost, the adventurers purchasing 
on credit, and a presumption of re-selling within a certain 
time their former acquisitions, at an advance equivalent 
to enable them to make good their former engagements. 
But they have found their calculations to exceed dread 
fully the capital settling this country from Europe, and 
now the paper of a Mr. Morris, of Philadelphia, who, in 
the last war, had more credit than the Union altogether, 
is selling at 4s. 6d. in the pound, though he still con 
tinues proceeding with a house that can not cost less 
than 200,000. There is not one cipher too many. 
Hence, you'll perceive, there is yet no bankruptcy sys 
tem established. Congress yet fear to cramp industry 
and enterprise in the young country for which they legis 
late, or to open a door to commercial fraud by any 
attempt of that sort, which, in the present state of the 
community, they wisely imagine would prove upon trial 
too lax or too rigid. And for my part, from the little I 
have yet seen, I can not but approve of their wisdom in 
leaving the creditor in a situation to see his debtor's 
knees begin to tremble, rather than run the risk of 
bringing both to the ground together. 

You must perceive then from what has been said, that 
there must be an infinity of land of every quality and 
situation in the market, and yet Congress have adver 
tised some townships to be sold at auction next January, 
which, upon full deliberation, they have resolved shall 
not be put up at less than two dollars an acre. There is 



38 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPEKS. 

however, an increase of wealth annually flowing into 
the country, unequaled in the annals of any other, from 
emigrations. These I can not now exactly estimate, but 
their effects are visible, in the increase of settlements in 
every direction, from the Atlantic to the Ohio and 
Mississippi. Witness the population of Kentucky (now 
considered almost an old country), swollen to 73,677, and 
even of Tennessee, to 77,262. In this track I am now 
preparing to set forward, but can not say how long I 
shall be anywhere stationary for a month before the next 
fall, at which time, after having explored Kentucky, 
Tennessee, and the Miami country, concerning all of 
which you shall hear the particulars in due time. I 
shall return through the wilderness by Virginia, if a 
settlement does not arrest me in the way. But I must 
postpone for the present any further particulars of my 
route to the "West, on account of the remaining remarks 
I have to make on those parts of the country which I 
have seen since I began this letter, with which I am now 
proceeding at Philadelphia. 

On our return from Long Island, we were received 
at Xew York, as well by the acquaintances we made 
without as by those to whom we had introductions from 
England, more in a parental and brotherly way than 
in a manner you would call polite or elegant. European 
etiquette is not yet prevalent, or it is that which reigned 
on the other side of the water, at least half a century 
back, but toward the particular style of English dress, 
both sexes have made greater advances. But these 
matters, with the state of domestic economy, I shall 
leave for Maggie to describe. After some days stay in 



39 

and about New York, we set out for Newark, in New 
Jersey. On our way two objects were conspicuously 
impressive in a distance of only ten miles from our 
outset. The first, a swamp, through which we passed, 
three miles in a direct line over a well-made new road. 
This swamp was not merely remarkable from its being 
the first I had seen, but from a hill of solid land, called 
Snake-hill, thickly wooded, which rises with almost 
perpendicular declivity to a hight in the center, that in 
an Englishman's eyes, would merit the name of a moun 
tain. When I say that the moment you could reach the 
base of this mount, in descending toward the plain, you 
would find far less footing than in an Irish shaking-bog, 
Snake-hill will be regarded by you, as it has been by me, 
a lusus natures of no small magnitude. 

The next object, a production of art, was the bridge 
over the Hackinsack, to which may be added that over 
the Passaic river, both about three hundred yards in 
length, which unite neatness and strength of work 
manship to an extent in timber that might well invite an 
European ten miles out of his road. The expense of 
erecting each of these, I conclude, from the account 
I have had of a similar one I have since crossed at 
Brunswick, over the Raritan, to be 30,000 Pennsylvania 
currency. Newark possessed sufficient attractions within 
itself to induce me to tarry there for some days ? even 
if I had not resolved to do so for the sake of visiting the 
Passaic Falls, about fifteen miles off the main road. 

Newark, if considered as a village, which it more 
resembles than a town, is perhaps the handsomest in the 
world. Of extent, nearly three miles ; it is seated in a 



40 THE BLEXXEHIIASSETT PAPERS. 

plain, clear and level as a parlor floor, on the banks 
of the Passaic, in an amphitheater environed by gently 
swelling hills. Its Academy, Court-house, and two neat 
buildings for public worship, added to nine stages, 
which, besides an infinity of wagons, every day pass 
through it between New York and Philadelphia, give 
an air of business and gaiety to the place. It is also the 
residence of many private families of respectability, 
with some of whom we were previously well enough 
acquainted to be entertained longer than we chose to 
remain there. Land is here, within five miles round, 
from 30 to 40 an acre, New York currency. 

The Passaic Falls, as they differ, I fancy, from all, 
others in America, will always invite and entertain the 
naturalist. Their peculiarity arises from a fissure in the 
bed of the river, which is of solid rock, cleft in an 
oblique direction to a depth of eighty feet. The river 
meanders a considerable way in a serene current without 
a murmur, till it reaches the chasm where it falls with 
the majesty of thunder, and forever throws up a spray 
that, when interposed between the eye and the sun, 
exhibits an assemblage of rainbows of the most fantastic 
beauty. 

From Newark to Philadelphia, I have only to remark 
the general sandy and poor appearance of the soil 
through Jersey State, which, however, is regarded as 
one of the best cultivated in the Union, and this indeed 
appears in the large extent of its corn country, and other 
agricultural improvements which, by trimming its tim 
ber, have rendered it sufficiently champaign to have 
caused it, during the late war, to be exposed to the 



AMATEUR IMPRESSIONS. 41 

constant harrassings of the British. In this route I 
passed, with pleasing reflections, over the memorable 
grounds of Brunswick, Princeton and Trenton. At the 
latter place I crossed the Delaware, in sight of the spot 
where Providence, or his happy fortune, gave the Presi 
dent and America that confidence in the issue of the 
contest, wherein the Hessians were surprised, which, to 
save the country, could not have been delayed for a day. 
On this side of the Delaware industry seemed to stride, 
rather than to saunter, as she did, comparatiYely speak 
ing, in the States of Jersey and New York. Here, after 
traveling in every direction over the soil, which yet she 
has not deserted, you may trace her footsteps not only 
under the earth, but from thence upward through all 
the stages of manufacture wood has yet passed in any 
country, and iron full one-half as far as it has reached in 
England. Of the extent of cotton, linen and wool, 
throughout the country, I can not yet positively speak. 
A considerable capital has been embarked at Patterson, 
near the Passaic Falls, in the cotton line ; but it has 
altogether failed from a variety of causes, which, 1 think, 
independent of the long credits given in Europe, and 
the vast wilds here doomed for half a century yet to 
howl for population, will so long, at least, frustrate all 
attempts at adventure in the three last mentioned 
branches of trade. 

The approach to Philadelphia, in this line, announces 
more a large busy city to which it leads, than any of 
those that surround New York; yet, from the detail of 
business I have before and since seen in both, assisted by 
a commercial view of the continent, it is pretty apparent

that the latter place is treading hard on the heels of the 
former already, and will soon step it by. At present, 
however, you see more stir at Philadelphia, more bustle 
in the streets, and far more English activity in both sexes. 
I inclose you a plan of the city, which, with fewer defects 
than any I know of, seems to have been conceived by 
Penn, upon the best principles to suit the climate, and 
provide for. the health, while it accommodates the busi 
ness, of the inhabitants. So much for Philadelphia. 

The only great person I regret not having become 
acquainted with is the President. He unfortunately set 
off for home two days after my arrival, which prevented 
my attending his leve*e ; but the day before his departure 
we were so fortunate as to be seated at church in the pew 
opposite to him. Adieu, my dear nephew, and believe me, 
Your ever affectionate uncle, 

H. BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. Maggie will speak for herself. 

At that time, the territory west of the Alleghanies, 
particularly the valley of the Ohio and Mississippi, was 
comparatively a wilderness. The enterprise of the pio 
neer had driven, to more distant regions, the aborigines 
of the West. The occasional hamlet, with its few 
acres of cultivated ground, interrupted, at intervals, the 
" boundless contiguity of shade," and marked the abode 
of civilized and associated man. Villages, with rude 
habitations, here and there, broke the silence of the 
forest, and presented the cheering signs of dawning civi 
lization. Through this vast solitude, the silvery .current 
of the Ohio wended its way to the " father of waters." 



IX THE WEST. 43 

The innovating steamer had never yet ruffled its bosom, 
nor startled its inhabitants with the sound of its machin 
ery. The deer browsed among the thick undergrowth of 
its bottoms ; the fox sought shelter in its caves ; and the 
wail of the wolf was heard from the adjacent hills. 
Lands of almost inexhaustible fertility skirted its mar 
gin, and isles of peculiar beauty decked its surface. 

Captivated with various descriptions of the country, in 
company with his wife, Blennerhassett set out to seek 
this delightful land. Crossing the rugged barriers of the 
Alleghanies, then a tedious and difficult undertaking, 
they arrived at Pittsburgh in the fall of 1796. Here they 
obtained passage on a keel-boat, in those days the most 
comfortable mode of traveling on the western waters, 
and shortly arrived at Marietta, a town of greater 
importance than any other in the State of Ohio. 

The population of this pleasantly-situated village was 
unusually intelligent and moral. The puritanical charac 
ter of its earlier inhabitants gave a tone to society, which 
identifies the present generation with their fathers who 
repose in their beautiful cemetery. 

Fully satisfied with the attractiveness of the country, 
Blennerhassett abandoned his contemplated explorations 
of Kentucky and Tennessee, and resolved to locate in 
this enterprising settlement. 

During the winter his time was pleasantly occupied 
in visiting the various families, and making occasional 
excursions through the neighborhood, to select a site for 
a residence. Above the village, and within a convenient 
distance, is an eminence of considerable height, com 
manding an extensive view of the river and surrounding 



44 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

scenery. With this situation he was much pleased, and 
had almost determined to erect on its summit a castle, 
after the manner of many in his native country ; but the 
ascent being difficult, and the declivities too precipitous, 
he abandoned the idea, and sought a situation more easy 
of access. 

The following spring, he purchased an island in 
the Ohio river, about two miles below Parkersburg, or 
the mouth of the Little Kanawha, which, to his pecu 
liar mind, possessed superior advantages to the adja 
cent farm. To one of romantic temperament, its locality 
was truly delightful. Upon its sloping banks waved the 
branches of the willow, and laved their foliage in the 
passing stream. The majestic forest trees, untouched by 
the hand of civilization, reared their trunks, as monarchs 
of the land ; while the wild-brier and woodbine, blending 
in promiscuous profusion, entwined their tendrils around 
the shrubbery of the wild-wood. Flowers of rare beauty 
burst spontaneously from the soil, and mingled their fra 
grance with the passing breeze. The feathery songsters 
warbled their notes in the secluded groves, making vocal 
each branch with nature's music. 

Could the mind, in pursuit of seclusion and repo&e, 
picture to its imagination a situation more desirable? 
Here might his cultivated taste adorn, to every extent, 
the ruder touches of nature, and mellow into softer 
shades the harsher outlines of her pencil; here might 
the mind, unfettered from worldly cares, drink deeper 
draughts from Truth's ever-flowing fountain; here, 

"At the shadowy close of day, 
When the hushed grove has sung its parting lay; 



ON THE ISLAND. 45 

When pensive Twilight, in her dusty car, 

Comes slowly on, to meet the evening star, 

Above, below, aerial murmurs swell, 

From hanging wood, brown heath, and bushy dell 

A thousand nameless rills that shun the light; 

Stealing soft music on the ear of night ; 

So oft the finer movements of the soul, 

That shun the sphere of pleasure's gay control, 

In the still shades of calm seclusion rise, 

And breathe their sweet, seraphic harmonies." 

When fatigued with the severer studies of science, he 
could amuse himself with the traditions and stories of 
several intelligent revolutionary soldiers who resided on 
the Belpr6 shore ; or, as game abounded, might engage 
in the delightful sports of hunting and fishing. 

That portion of the island purchased by Blennerhas- 
sett, was known by the familiar cognomen of " Backus's 
Island," and contained about one hundred and seventy 
acres. General Washington, it is said, embraced this 
gem of nature, in the many valuable tracts of land 
entered by him on the bottoms of the Ohio. 

In 1798, Blennerhassett, having purchased the upper 
portion of the island, at a cost of four thousand five 
hundred dollars, moved into a block-house situated near 
the head. This, to those who had enjoyed the splendor 
of palaces, with the many conveniences which the arts 
of civilization afford, was a sorrowful exchange which 
few could desire, and fewer still would have made. He 
energetically commenced clearing the grounds of the 
thick growth of timber and underwood, for a site upon 
which to erect a dwelling. Many hands were requisite, 
in addition to the slaves he had recently purchased, for 



46 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the laborious task. The forest trees were uprooted, and 
their boughs and trunks conveyed away. The small 
inequalities, not suiting his fastidiousness, were smoothed 
and regulated as fancy dictated. 

Vainly ambitious to excel any private residence west 
of the mountains, and to fashion it after those of his 
own country, economy and simplicity were not consulted 
in its construction. " The house and offices I occupy," 
he writes Devereux, the Irish patriot refugee, " stand me 
in upward of thirty thousand dollars, not mentioning 
gardens and shrubbery, in the English style, hedges, post 
fences, and complete farm-yards, containing barns, sta 
bles, overseers' and negro houses," etc. 

To the mind of the voyager descending the river, as 
the edifice rose majestically in the distance, spreading its 
wings to either shore, the effect was magical ; and 
emotions were produced, not unlike those experienced 
in gazing on the Moorish palaces of Andalusia. There 
was a spell of enchantment around it, which would fain 
induce the credulous to believe that it had been created 
by magic, and consecrated to the gods. On a nearer 
approach, was observed the beautifully graded lawn, 
decked with tasteful shrubbery, and interspersed with 
showy flowers; while, a little in the distance, the elm 
threw its dark branches over a carpet of most beautiful 
green sward. Beyond these, the forest trees were inter 
mingled with copse-wood, so closely as to exclude the 
noon-day sun ; and, in other places, they formed those 
long sweeping vistas, in the intricacies of which the eye 
delights to lose itself; while the imagination co'nceives 
them as the paths of wilder scenes of sylvan solitude. 



BLENNERHASSETT'S SEAT. 47 

The space immediately in the rear of the dwelling was 
assigned to fruits and flowers; of which the varieties 
were rare, excellent and beautiful; and the manner in 
which they were disposed over the surface, unique, ele 
gant and tasteful. Espaliers of peach, apricot, quince 
and pear trees, extended along the exterior, confined to a 
picket fence; while, in the middle space, wound laby 
rinthine walks, skirted with flowering shrubs, and the 
eglantine and honey-suckle flung their melliferous blos 
soms over bowers of various forms. 

On the south was the vegetable garden, and adjoining 
this, a thrifty young orchard, embracing many varieties 
of fruit, promising abundant supplies for future use. 
Not entirely neglecting the useful for the ornamental, a 
hundred acres had been cleared where were cultivated 
the various crops adapted to the soil.* 

* The Lower Kanawha is one hundred and fifty yards wide at its mouth. 
Opposite to this river is the town of Belpre, three miles from which is 
Backus's Island. On leaving Marietta, a lady and gentleman, who had 
been on a visit there, desired a passage to the island. This request was, 
with much pleasure, granted ; and I had only to lament that the voyage 
was so short, which was to terminate my acquaintance with persons so 
truly interesting and amiable. The island hove in sight to great advan 
tage from the middle of the river, from which point of view little more 
appeared than the simple decorations of nature trees, shrubs, and flowers 
of every perfume and kind. The next point of view, on running with the 
current, on the right hand side, varied to a scene of enchantment ; a lawn 
in the form of a fan inverted presented itself, the nut forming the center 
and summit of the island, and the broad segment the borders of the water. 
The lawn contained one hundred acres of the best pasture, interspersed 
with flowering shrubs and clumps of trees, in a manner that conveyed 
a strong conviction of the taste and judgment of the proprietor. The 
house came into view at the instant I was signifying a wish that such a 
lawn had a mansion. It stands on the immediate summit of the island, 
whose ascent is very gradual, is snow white, two stories high, and fur 
nished with wings which interlock the adjoining trees, confine the

Such was the residence of Blennerhassett, after he had 
expended much labor and money to render it the reality 
of what before was but ideal, an image of which had 
long haunted his dreams of youthful fancy, as the picture 
of sylvan beauty, of peaceful solitude, and of calm 
repose. How marked the mutations of a few short 
years ! Ireland, but as yesterday, claimed him as a 
representative of one of her great families, and the 
uncompromising advocate of her long neglected rights.

ical government, was his by inheritance ; and the favor

are so often suffered to destroy the effect of the noblest views in England. 
The full front of the house, being the signal for pulling in for the island, 
we did so immediately, and fell below a small wharf that covered an eddy, 
and made the landing both easy and secure. There was no resisting the 
friendly importunity of my passengers ; no excuse would be taken ; to 
stop the night at least was insisted upon, and with a convincing expression 
that the desire flowed from hearts desirous not to be refused. There is 
something so irresistible in invitations of such a nature, that they can not 
be denied. I gave instructions respecting my boat; and giving the lady 
my arm, we walked up the beautiful lawn, through which a winding path 
led to the house. It was tea-time; that refreshment was served and con 
ducted with a propriety and elegance which I never witnessed out of 
Britain. The conversation was chaste and general, and the manners of 
the lady and gentleman were refined, without being frigid ; distinguished, 
without being ostentatious ; and familiar, without being vulgar, importu 
nate, or absurd. Before the entire decline of day, we walked in the gar 
dens, which were elegantly laid out in your country's style, produced 
remarkably fine vegetables, and had a very favorable show of standard 
peaches and other fruits. We next turned into the woods. I soon per 
ceived why the island was named Bacchus. The island took its cognomen 
from the gentleman of whom it was purchased. It abounds with vines 
which grow to great hight and strength, but never produce to any perfec 
tion. The path we had taken led to the water, the border of which brought 
us to the boat, where, it seems, all the servants of the family had assem 
bled to hear what news my people might have brought into their little 
world. ' We found them seated on the green around Mindeth, who, proud

and sciences, proved a powerful auxiliary in aggravating

CHAPTER III. 

BLENNERHASSETT was about six feet in stature, of slen 
der proportions, and slightly stooping. He was entirely 
devoid of that suaviter in modo, which is so attractive to 
the gentler sex, and not unfrequently captivates the 
minds of firmer mold, in society at large. His forehead 
was prominent; 'and claimed for its uo&ses&oi ; an, lijte-li- 
gence above the ordinary capacity of mankind. ' His 
nose was the distinguishing feature of a face which wore 
an aspect of seriousness; afrd .th'ougiit, -almost amounting 
to cold reserve. Like many of the nobility, he was 
extremely near-sighted ; and, unlike many of the pres 
ent age, who ape this defect of nature, he found it a 
matter of serious inconvenience. In gunning, particu 
larly (an amusement of which he was passionately fond), 
he had usually to be accompanied by his wife, or some 
one of his servants, who levelled his fowling-piece and 
brought it to bear on the game. Peter, a domestic, who 
sometimes attended him, was in the habit of taking 
his station at a short distance, and giving directions 
after the following manner : 

" Now, level, Mr. Blennerhassett. A little to the left ! 
Now to the right ! there ! steady I fire ! " Off would 
go the gun, and not unfrequently the game. 

His usual dress was of the " old English style, with 



EXPERIMENT. 51 

scarlet, or buff-colored, small-clotL.es and silk stockings ; 
shoes, with silver buckles ; and a coat generally of blue 
broad-cloth. When at home, his dress was rather care 
less ; often, in warm weather, in his shirt sleeves, with 
out coat or waistcoat ; and, in winter, he wore a thick 
woollen roundabout or jacket."* 

Retiring in disposition, his life was sedentary and 
studious ; books and philosophical experiments possess 
ing greater attractions than the gay and fashionable 
assemblies of the ball-room. Always entertaining, he 
never indulged in trivial conversation, but interested his 
audience in something calculated more to instruct the 
understanding than to amuse their fancy. 

His scientific studies, which were much facilitated by 
means of his various apparatus, included chemistry, elec 
tricity, galvanism, and astronomy. By the aid of a tele 
scope and solar microscope, it was with much satisfaction 
that he could demonstrate the truth of his theories by 
practical observation, and acquaint himself more fully 
with the motions and positions of the planets, as well as 
the minuter bodies of the earth. While experimenting 
in chemistry, he had conceived the idea that animal sub 
stance might be so adipocerated as to subserve the use of 
spermaceti for light. He accordingly placed pieces of 
meat in a small inlet from the river, to undergo a chemi 
cal change. When the proper time had elapsed, as he 
supposed, to test the truth of his theory, on visiting the 
cove he found the finny tribes of the water had antici 
pated his experiment by converting the meat into food. 



* Hildreth " American Review," 1848. 



52 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The act was not repeated, and his theory remained unde- 
monstrated. 

He was a connoisseur in music, and performed admir 
ably upon the violin and violincello. Many of his hours 
of recreation were whiled away with this delightful 
amusement; and, being an adept, pieces of his own 
composition were played with animating effect. 

Of an unsuspecting disposition, he was easily imposed 
upon by the misrepresentations of others. Not unfre- 
quently had he to pay enormously for his practical know 
ledge of life and human nature. It is reported of him 
that, on one occasion, having employed an individual to 
collect muscle shells from the beach, on which they were 
scattered in great profusion, when the laborer came to 
receive his pay, Blennerhassett inquired the reason of 
his high charge. 

" The diving's so deep, and the shells are so scarce." 

" But," replied Blennerhassett, " you do not dive, do 
you?" 

"Ay, indeed! In fifteen feet water." 

Believing there was no occasion for misrepresenting a 
fact, which could be readily ascertained by a short walk 
to the river, Blennerhassett paid the man his money a 
sum equal to five times the real value of the shells. 

Of a nervous temperament, he not unfrequently 
imagined objects which had no existence in nature, 
and apprehended evils that were never to be realized. 
Earthquakes and thunder-storms, to him, were intensely 
alarming; and such was his timidity on the approach of 
a threatening cloud, that it was his usual custom to close 
the doors and windows of his house, and place himself 



THE LADY. 53 

in the centre of a bed, to avoid the accidental effects of 
the electric fluid. 

Of his forensic talents, or legal ability, he never, 
in this country, gave evidence. He was not deficient, 
however, in either. The county court of Wood county 
recommended him to the Governor of Virginia for the 
magistracy ; and by bis Excellency he was duly commis 
sioned: but presuming it a condescension for which he 
should be poorly paid, and still less respected, he mod 
estly declined to " qualify," and remained a private 
citizen. 

Let us turn, for a time, from the man, to contem 
plate the person and character of his companion. 
History affords but few instances where so much 
feminine beauty, physical endurance, and many social 
virtues, were combined with so brilliant a mind, in 
the person of a female. 

Her stature was above the ordinary hight of her sex ; 
her form well proportioned and beautifully symmetrical ; 
her manners of the most captivating gracefulness, with 
sufficient dignity to repel familiarity and command 
respect. Her dark-blue eyes, beaming with love and 
affection, and " sparkling with life and intelligence," 
looked forth from beneath the long brown lashes, which 
hung as curtains to conceal their charms. Features of 
Grecian mold, embellished by a complexion whose car 
nation hue health and the hand of nature alone had 
painted. Her hair, which was of a dark-brown color, 
was usually concealed beneath a head-dress of rich- 
colored silk worn after the manner of the Turkish 
turban. 



54 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Her mind was not less polished than her manners ; 
and the fluency with which she wrote and spoke the 
French and Italian languages, indicated a high degree 
of cultivation, to which few, even in this golden age of 
science and letters, have ever attained. Her taste for 
dramatic composition led her to adopt, as a favorite pas 
time, the rehearsal of Shakspeare^s plays. These were 
usually executed with an effect which would have done 
honor to more professed connoisseurs, and exhibited a 
talent which needed only cultivation to have won lau 
rels of lasting freshness in the theatrical world. Her 
familiarity with various French and English authors ren 
dered her an agreeable companion for the man of letters, 
and proved a valuable assistant to her husband in recal 
ling to mind some opinion or expresion of an author 
which had escaped his memory. 

She cultivated, to some extent, a taste for poetry, and 
produced several pieces which are still in existence. As 
we are enabled to offer a specimen of her powers in this 
flowery department of literature, we forbear an expres 
sion of opinion, but leave the lines to represent their 
authoress. 

But it is only in the every-day affairs of life that we 
- / can gain a perfect knowledge of the true character of 
individuals. It was in this peculiar sphere that Mrs. 
Blennerhassett exhibited an uncommon degree of excel 
lence, and won the affection of all within her influence. 
She adapted her customs to the society around her, and 
joined in their amusements and festivities with all the 
spirit of one accustomed to frontier life from earliest 
infancy. Riding on horseback was a delightful and 



THE HOUSEWIFE. 55 

healthy exercise, in which she frequently participated. 
At such times, she was usually hahited in a fine cloth 
riding-dress, of scarlet color, richly "bespangled with gold 
lace and glittering buttons. From her downy hat waved 
"the graceful plume of the ostrich," and "the rich folds 
of her drapery fell gaily over the flanks of her noble 
steed. Over hill and through dale, with the fleetness 
of the deer, she took her course, and seldom did her 
attendant get a glimpse of his sprightly charge until 
she checked her speed to await his coming. 

That she was capable of extraordinary physical endur 
ance was frequently demonstrated by the long and speedy 
walks she performed, whether on business or visiting 
some favorite friend. She has been known to accom 
plish a pedestrian tour, of from ten to twenty miles, 
with as much ease as other ladies would make their 
usual calls among city or village acquaintances. Fences 
or fallen timbers were no impediments. Bounding over 
them with astonishing agility, she carelessly pursued her 
way, as though tracing the more familiar paths of the 
wild woods. 

Although she participated in the various amusements 
through the country, and was the ruling spirit of every 
assembly, she never neglected the ordinary duties of her 
household ; every apartment received her personal atten 
tion, from the kitchen to the chambers, and was duly 
cleansed and arranged according to her direction. By 
her were the daily tasks of the servants assigned, while 
she performed with cheerfulness the duties devolving 
upon herself.

CHAPTER IV. 

THE character and habits of life of the early settlers 
of Western Virginia, are topics which have engaged the 
labors of but few pens ; but they are not the less inter 
esting on that account. 

Many of the inhabitants of this new, and hitherto 
uncultivated, portion of the State, were intelligent sons 
of families of distinction in the " Old Dominion." The 
great abundance of game of nearly every variety, the 
free and exciting sports of a life in the "Western wilds, 
devoid of care and free from the conventional restraints 
of society; the health-invigorating glorious fun of fol 
lowing 

"The stag to the slippery crag, 
And chasing the bounding roe," 

combined to allure the ardent and pleasure-loving youths 
from the tamer scenes of their childhood to those bound 
less fields of new and ever-changing excitement. Others 
enjoying smaller patrimonies, hearing of the rich allu 
vial bottoms of the Ohio and its tributaries, and the 
low price at which land could be procured, deserted their 
less inviting homesteads to seek new sources of wealth 
beyond those blue peaks which many regarded as the 
Western limit of civilization. Penury, and the exhaust 
ed lands of other portions of the State, drove no incon- 



FRONTIER LIFE. 57 

siderable number in search of genial soil, where the 
hand of man might realize rich returns from the toil 
bestowed upon it ; or the abounding game should furnish 
supplies without the effort which nature requires of 
those who seek her bounties. 

Populated by these various classes, enticed thither 
through considerations as different as the dispositions 
and circumstances of the individuals themselves, that 
love of society which is seldom lost in man served to 
banish distinctions of rank, and render an absolute 
equality essentially necessary to their social existence. 
Around the blazing fire, the son of the wide-famed 
statesman tripped merrily in the mazes of the dance 
with the daughter of the unknown peasant. The 
scholar, orator and divine strove, in eager emulation, 
to plant their rifle-balls as hear the center of the target 
as that of the uncultivated woodsman. 

Remote from friends, from society, and the pleasing 
associations of earlier years, they devised amusements in 
every thing, and made frolic of labor itself. A house- 
raising, or log-rolling, was as cheerfully attended as the 
wedding of a favorite friend; and a corn-husking col 
lected the inhabitants from several miles around. The 
almost daily interchange of civilities, and constant asso 
ciation of the various classes, as well for the purpose of 
joint protection against the deadly rifle of the savage, 
as the innate love of company, served to mold the 
general character of the population into a distinct type, 
peculiar to themselves, and stamped their virtues with 
an originality which the mutations of time have failed 
to change. 



58 THE BLENXERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The Virginian, thus re-molded (if we may be allowed 
the expression), from his active habits of life, was capable 
of extraordinary feats of strength and astonishing agility 
of limb. For a wrestle or a foot-race, he was always 
ready, and never refused a challenge to take a trial at 
either. While, to gratify his revenge, he would have 
grappled with Apollo for the tripod of the temple ; yet 
the overflowing fountains of his heart gushed forth, in 
streams of sympathy, for the misfortunes of his fellow- 
men. Chivalrous, brave, and independent, "he would 
not have courted Neptune for his trident, nor Jove for 
his power to thunder." With a generosity bordering on 
extravagance, his house, his horse, his gun yea, every 
thing but the sacredness of virtue were at the disposal 
of his friends. Clad in the buck-skin moccasin, with a 
hunting-shirt of linsey-woolsey, his rifle on his shoulder, 
and a butcher-knife at his side, he never changed his 
apparel to suit the circumstances under which he was 
placed ; and, whether pursuing the fleeting game, visit 
ing a neighbor, or attending the services of the church, 
the same attire was suitable both to the day and the 
occasion. 

The deer hunt, the horse-race, and ever-glorious fox- 
chase, were the usual sources of amusement among the 
men ; while the women found enjoyment at the various 
wool-pickings and quiltings throughout the neighbor 
hood. The circumstance of their spending so much 
time in the enjoyment of lawful amusements, is to be 
accounted for in the fact,' that, at that early period, they 
had but few desires to be satisfied, and fewer wants to 
be supplied. There being then but little, if any, demand

for agricultural produce, it was unnecessary to raise 
more than the consumption of the immediate vicinity 
required. Remotely situated from the extravagance and 
luxury of more cultivated society, there was no need of 
mahogany sideboards, groaning with champagne, nor 
of Brussels nor Turkey carpets to decorate their floors. 

Their unflinching patriotism was repeatedly tested in 
the Revolution, and in various engagements with the 
Indians. At the first call of their country's voice, the 
animated response was heard in every hamlet. "When 
they had neither the soldier's uniform, nor equipages, 
nor arms, they seized their trusty rifles ; and, from their 
smiling fields of toil, from the pleasant scenes of their 
sportive pastimes, they flew to win a soldier's name or a 
soldier's grave. The result of their efforts shall glow 
beneath the pencil and the pen shall live in national 
song, and survive in the spirit-stirring anthem, till none 
are worthy to repeat the strain, or to paint the scenes of 
their country's glory ! When the question of the pur 
chase of Louisiana was first mooted in our national 
councils, and it was then urged that the inhabitants of 
that territory would prevent a free and easy navigation 
of the Mississippi river; " Give me," said Washington, 
" three hundred picked men, well-tried and true, of old 
West Augusta,* and I will carve my way to the Gulf." 
What higher compliment could have been paid to the 
patriotism and bravery of the original settlers of the

trans- Alleghany country, of whom a few still remain, 
as land-marks by which to trace the characters of the 
departed ? 

"While this type of character occupied the Eastern 
shore of the Ohio, that of the West contained another, 
as marked and distinct as that of the Cavalier from the 
Roundhead. Many revolutionary officers and soldiers of 
the Northern States, who had exhausted their resources 
in fighting the battles of their country, and who, from 
the depleted state of the national finances had to 
remain for a time without indemnity, either for their 
services or losses, sought this new land, where they 
could recuperate their shattered fortunes by economy 
and industry. Others, too, of the sons of New England, 
attracted also by the fruitful valleys of this beautiful and 
majestic river, bade farewell to the rocky and ungrateful 
soil of their birth, and, with a plow and a bed, a Bible 
and a wife, set out for the West. Here, hundreds of 
miles from father Aminidab and mother Patience, they 
set themselves industriously to work, clearing up farms, 
from which to realize fortunes, as soon as the circum 
stances of the country would permit. That their most 
sanguine expectations have been fully realized, is hap 
pily demonstrated by the fields waving with grain, val 
leys filled with herds, and hills covered with flocks, 
which meet the eye of the traveler as he passes along 
the stream. While the meed of praise has been awarded 
them for their indefatigable industry, they have not been 
regarded as possessing that generous hospitality which 
is characteristic of their neighbors of Virginia. . Edu 
cated , to believe there was no product without labor, no 



61 

wealth without economy, they indulged but little in 
amusements, and were careful against expense. In their 
moral and religious observances, they were rigidly aus 
tere. Like the Puritans of Plymouth Rock, from whom 
they were descended, the Bible formed the chief rule of 
their conduct. Their family government was based upon 
its precepts, and its holy teachings were listened to, each 
Sabbath, in the " forest sanctuary." True, some there 
were who occasionally broke over the more austere les 
sons which had been taught them by their parents, but 
the exceptions, " like angels' visits, were few and far 
between." If their liberality at any time exhibited 
itself, it was usually toward objects of charity, or to 
spread the teachings of that gospel which they had been 
taught ever to revere. For bravery and devotion to the 
welfare of their country, they were justly regarded the 
equals of their neighbors; and acts of Indian cruelty 
were jointly revenged by the two. Having enjoyed 
early advantages in the best schools and academies of 
their native States, they were fully informed upon the 
subjects usually taught at such institutions, and many 
possessed talents of superior brilliancy. 

Such were the men with whom Blennerhassett had 
cast his fortunes. The variety of characters, perhaps, 
was as great, if the number of persons was far less, as 
that of the society he had recently abandoned. There 
was the hospitable Virginian, who, though he neither 
claimed nor desired the titular dignity of a nobleman, 
exhibited a generosity equal to that of its proudest 
possessor, a generosity which knew no bounds, and 
awaited no emergency for its exercise. "With a reckless 



62 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

prodigality, he scattered his bounties broadcast ; threw 
open the doors of hospitality; lavishing, with an 
unsparing hand, the gifts which fortune had bestowed 
upon him. There was the high-toned chivalry of the 
Crusades, which stooped to no baseness ; cringed to no 
superior; nor was intimidated by menace; performing 
kindnesses, without ostentation, acts of daring, without 
boasting, and relieving the wants of the distressed, 
without the hope of reward. There was the zealous 
Puritan, acknowledging no superior but God; no law 
binding on the moral man but the Bible ; no religion 
but that of Calvin; rejecting the unmeaning forms of 
Popery; combating the doctrine of apostolic success- 
sion; and discarding, in his worship, the use of the 
gown, the surplice, and the prayer-book. There, the 
meek and pious Christian, dispensing charities without 
parsimony ; visiting the sick and the afflicted, and min 
gling the comforts of religion with the sad and agoniz 
ing scenes of death. And there, too, alas ! the crafty 
and wily miscreant, making promises never to be ful 
filled ; taking advantages in trade ; regarding neither 
the teachings of Holy Writ, nor the precepts of moral 
ity ; but ever faithless, ever insincere, prostrating virtue 
without compunction, and indulging in every lawless 
vice. 



TROUBLE BREWING. 63 



CHAPTER V. 

BEFORE entering upon the more important incidents 
in the life of Blennerhassett, a preliminary view of 
"Western history is necessary to a knowledge of subse 
quent events. 

But few of the millions who now populate the valley 
of the Mississippi, are familiar, even "by tradition, with 
the difficulties which attended its early colonization. 
While the States of the Atlantic had engaged the 
energies of the government, the pioneers of the wilder 
ness had heen seriously neglected. That young and 
fertile region lay yet an unbroken forest, but sparsely 
inhabited, and separated from the sea-board by inter 
minable mountains and boundless solitudes. Shut out 
from the avenues of trade, it contributed nothing to the 
resources of the government, then much reduced by the 
Revolution, and the demands of its citizens were regard 
ed as burthens to the State, and useless exactions from 
the public treasury. JSTature, it is true, had supplied 
it with those noble rivers, now the great arteries of 
trade, but the arbitrary interdict of Spain had closed 
them against the enterprise and energy of the people. 

The navigation of the Mississippi had been a fruitful 
source of complaint almost from the first occupation 
of the territory. Favorites had been rewarded by the 



64 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

authorities of Louisiana, but even these had been com 
pelled to contribute to the Spanish Crown. Congress 
had been frequently solicited to assert the rights of the 
people, whose prosperity was retarded by the restrictive 
intercourse of trade, yet such was the embarrassment 
of the government, they could but faintly hope for relief, 
and that, if at all, at a distant day, and under many 
disabilities. 

The murmurings of discontent which thus far had been 
comparatively, but faintly, heard, began now to assume 
a more threatening tone. Those who had been most 
loyal in their affection for the Republic, faltered in their 
allegiance to the confederation. The Government had 
been admonished of a rupture of the Union, and a forci 
ble alliance with a rival power. Measures of relief had 
been seriously determined on, but the manner of their 
accomplishment was a subject of no little diversity of 
opinion. While some advocated the separate organiza 
tion of a new Republic, independent of the United 
States, and closely allied with Spain, others desired 
annexation to Louisiana, and submission to Spanish 
domination. Some there were who advised a war with 
Spain, as affording a pretext for seizing on New Orleans ; 
while a fourth suggested that Congress should be pre 
vailed on to show preparation for war, and by alarming 
their apprehensions, " extort from the Cabinet of Madrid 
what it persisted in refusing." The fifth and last sug 
gested, that France should be solicited to procure a 
retrocession of Louisiana, and to extend her protection 
to the inhabitants of Kentucky.*

GEN. WILKINSON. 65 

The extension of its American possessions, and the 
control of trade, had long' been the desire of the Span 
ish Crown. The occasion was opportune, and did not 
escape the superior vigilance of its public servant. The 
obstruction to navigation, which had been purposely 
thrown in the way of the inhabitants of the upper 
country, seemed now to have produced the desired 
result ; and Miro, the Governor of Louisiana, nattered 
himself, from the discontent which appeared every where 
prevailing, that at no distant day he could report to the 
Cabinet the dismemberment of Kentucky from the 
Union, and its voluntary acknowledgement of Spanish 
domination. 

General James Wilkinson was at -that time one of the 
leading men of the district. He had been a successful 

O 

soldier in the Revolution, and greatly distinguished him 
self by his unflinching courage and superior military 
tact. Like many of his compatriots, at % the close of the 
war, he had been left with limited pecuniary resources, 
and found it necessary to turn his attention to other 
pursuits. Still comparatively young, with a vigorous 
constitution, and superior intellectual attainments, he 
hoped soon to establish an independence of fortune, and 
elevate himself to distinguished civic position. With a 
remarkably discriminating judgment, few men better 
understood the motives which influence human action, 
and none more successful in wielding that knowledge 
to his own advantage. 

In the fall of 1787, having laden a boat with tobacco 
and flour, he descended to New Orleans, with the osten 
sible purpose of making arrangements with the Spanish 



63 THE BLENNERI1ASSETT PAPERS. 

authorities, by which to secure to the inhabitants of the 
upper waters the free navigation of the river, and a 
market for their products. Scarcely had he landed, 
however, before he found himself surrounded by a 
retinue of officers, who informed him that they were 
directed to seize upon his cargo, which had been confis 
cated to the Government, and that he himself was 
required to appear before the Governor. Miro soon dis 
covered that the individual, of all others, whom he could 
have most desired for the furtherance of his objects, was 
then in his presence, a suppliant for his favor. He 
found in Wilkinson a man of ripe experience and exten 
sive influence. Insinuating in address, bold but reserved, 
with a ready familiarity in the passing affairs of foreign 
governments, not less than in those of his own, he pos 
sessed in an eminent degree many of the higher qualities 
of an accomplished diplomatist. Hence, it was of the 
first importance tjjhat his services should be secured to the 
interest of the crown, which might thus, by the efficient 
aid of an emissary in disguise, perfect its plans without 
the hazard of detection. At the close of the interview, 
the boats were released, and permission granted to 
dispose of the cargo. A generous display of hospitality, 
on the part of the Governor and citizens, soon succeeded. 
Costly feasts and brilliant assemblages became the daily 
entertainment, to which Wilkinson was invited. Per 
mission was also granted him to " introduce into Louis 
iana, free of duty, many Western articles of trade which 
were adapted to the market." 

The sudden and growing intimacy between the Span 
ish Governor and American planter had been marked b}

many, and excited a suspicion of intrigue between the 
two. It was slyly insinuated that something beyond 
commercial privileges was in negotiation ; but with its 
objects and entire extent they were, as yet, imperfectly 
acquainted. Nothing was at that time disclosed further 
than that Wilkinson had written a dissertation " respect 
ing the political interests of Spain and the inhabitants 
of the United States, dwelling in the regions upon the 
Western waters." This was addressed to Miro, to be 
forwarded to the King of Spain, with whom he desired 
it to be known that he was then negotiating for the free 
navigation of the Mississippi. But it has been asserted, 
and certainly not without proof, that this communica 
tion was intended by Wilkinson to conceal a different 
design, indorsed by Miro, and to which but few others 
were privy. 

Gardoqui, the Spanish minister in Philadelphia, with 
out the knowledge of Miro, and, therefore, without con 
cert of plan, had conceived the project of settling 
Louisiana by emigration from the United States. By 
this means he hoped to draw to the interest of the 
Spanish Crown the people of Kentucky, which should 
result in her secession from the Union, with other dis 
tricts then similarly disaffected. 

To Pierre d'Args, Gardoqui committed the execution 
of his scheme. By authority of the Cabinet at Madrid, 
he invited the inhabitants of Kentucky, and those dwell 
ing along the Cumberland, to remove to West Florida, 
and the Florida district of Lower Louisiana, arid place 
themselves under the protection of Spain. Liberal 
grants of land, with extensive privileges, were offered to- 



68 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

all who desired to better their condition ; and as a greater 
inducement to those owning property, slaves, stock, 
farming utensils, and provisions for two years, were to be 
admitted free ; while a duty of twenty-five per cent, was 
levied upon property imported into the colony for trade 
or consumption. 

But the plan of the Spanish representative threatened 
a collision with that of Miro. Both were ambitious of 
the favor at court, with which the success of their under 
takings w^ould be rewarded; and hence they desired to 
keep as a secret the means by which the object was to be 
effected. 

In a dispatch addressed by Miro on the 8th of January, 
1788, to Valdds, the Minister and Secretary of State for 
the department of the Indies, writing of the plans of 
D'ArgSs, he says: "I fear that they may clash with 
Wilkinson's principal object. In the first place, D'Args 
having presented himself here with very little pru 
dence and concealment, it may turn out, that Wilkin 
son, in Kentucky, being made aware of the mission of 
this agent, may think we are not sincere, and that, 
endeavoring to realize his project without him, we use 
him merely as a tool to facilitate the operations of 
D'Args. Under the impression that D'ArgSs may reap 
the whole credit of the undertaking, in case of success, 
it may happe^ that he will counteract them ; for this 
reason I have been reflecting for many days, whether it 
would not be proper to communicate to D'Args Wilkin 
son's plans, and to Wilkinson the mission of D'ArgSs, in 
order to unite them, and to dispose them to work in 
concert. But I dare not do so, because D'Args may 



WILKINSON'S MOVEMENTS. 69 

consider that the great projects of Wilkinson may destroy 
the merit of his own, and he may communicate .them to 
some one who might cause Wilkinson to be arrested as 
a criminal ; and, also, because Wilkinson may take 
offense at another being admitted to participate in con 
fidential proceedings upon which depended his life and 
honor, as he expresses himself in his memoir."* 

In the same dispatch he continues: " The delivering 
up of Kentucky into his Majesty's hands, which is the 
main object to which Wilkinson has promised to devote 
himself entirely, would forever constitute this province 
a rampart for the protection of ]N"ew Spain. 
* ts r ' * * * * * * 

The Western people would no longer have any induce 
ment to emigrate, if they were put in possession of a 
free trade with us. This is the reason why this privilege 
should be granted only to a few individuals having influ 
ence among them, as is suggested in Wilkinson's memo 
rial, because, in their seeing the advantages bestowed on 
the few, they might be easily persuaded to acquire the 
like by becoming Spanish subjects.". 

Wilkinson, having remained several months at 'New 
Orleans, instead of returning to Kentucky by way of the 
river, sailed for Philadelphia, from whence he proceeded 

* This official dispatch of Miro's reveals the fact of what had before rested 
only on suspicion, that Wilkinson prepared two memorials to the king one 
for the eye of the public, particularly the people of the West, asserting their 
rights and the importance of their trade to Louisiana and to Spain, and ex 
pressing his fears, in the meantime, lest the English should intervene, and, 
by joining with the disaffected portion of the western districts, wrest from ' 
the Spanish crown its possessions in Louisiana ; the other, intended only 
for the Cabinet at Madrid, disclosing a plan for the acquisition of Ken 
tucky, by her separation from the Union and attachment to Louisiana. 



70 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to Kichmond, Virginia, then the seat of Government for 
the Kentucky District. From this point he addressed a 
letter to Gardoqui, relative to the affairs of Louisiana, 
and, as he subsequently informed Miro, to sound him 
upon his plans, and to divert his attention from himself, 
as he had been informed that his own reception at New 
Orleans had been the subject of comment by the Span 
ish Minister. 

Gardoqui, in the meantime, was busily engaged in car 
rying forward his scheme of colonization. Col. George 
Morgan, a soldier of the Revolution, had conceived 
himself greatly injured by the Government, in rejecting 
what he believed a meritorious claim, and smarting 
under his disappointment, resolved to avail himself of 
the opportunity of placing himself beyond the limits of 
the United States, and, by securing a liberal grant of the 
Spanish Crown, to restore his broken fortunes in the 
fertile valley of the Mississippi. Having applied to Gar 
doqui, he obtained the conveyance of a vast tract of 
land, situated some seventy miles below the mouth of 
the Ohio, upon which he stipulated to place a large num 
ber of families, and subsequently laid out the town of 
New Madrid. D'Args had already informed Charles de 
Grandpre\ Governor of batches, to have preparation 
made for the reception of fifteen hundred and eighty-two 
families, which were expected soon to arrive from Ken 
tucky to take possession of their promised bounties.* 

* To each family not owning negroes was granted six arpens of land, 
fronting a bayou or water-course, with forty in depth, making a total of 
two hundred and forty arpens ; to such as had two, three, or four slaves, 
or had a family composed of four or six adult unmarried sons capable of 
working, te i arpens in front by forty in depth ; to such as had from ten

During the month of February, 1788, Wilkinson re 
turned across the mountains to Kentucky. His splendid 
equipage and numerous servants attracted the attention 
and excited the wonder of his old companions, while 
rumors were freely circulated, that his sudden exhibition 
of wealth was to be attributed to something beyond the 
profits on his Southern cargo. It was suggested that 
others, who should follow his example, might discover 
the source from whence it sprung, and that the philoso 
pher's stone, which was to turn every thing it touched 
into gold, lay within the limits of the Spanish dominion. 
On the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi he 
grew quite enthusiastic, demonstrating in glowing lan 
guage the benefits to be derived from direct commercial 
relations with New Orleans, and at the same time inform 
ing his friends of the exclusive privileges which had 
been granted him by the Spanish Governor. He entered 
into large contracts for tobacco, and at once excited the 
jealousy of his rivals by the liberal prices offered for 
western products.* 

Soon after his return he dispatched a pirogue, with two 
oarsmen, to New Orleans, conveying a communicationf 



to twenty negroes, fifteen arpens by forty ; and to those owning more than 
twenty negroes, twenty arpens by forty.

to Miro. informing the latter of his safe return across 
the mountains, and assuring him that their joint de 
sign was soon to be accomplished, as Kentucky had 
separated herself from Virginia^ and the rest, as Spain 
desired, must inevitably follow. " I have," he says, " col 
lected much European and American news, and have 
made various interesting observations for our political 
designs. It would take a volume to contain all that I 
have to communicate to you. But I dispatch this letter 
with such haste, and its fate is so uncertain, that I hope 
you will excuse me for not saying more until the arrival 
of my boats, and, in the meantime, I pray you to content 
yourself with this assurance, all my predictions are verify 
ing themselves, and not a measure is taken on both sides of 
the mountains which does not conspire to favor ours. * * * 
I beg you to be easy, and to be satisfied that nothing 
shall deter me from attending exclusively to the object 
we have in hand, and I am convinced that the success 
of our plan will depend on the disposition of the Qourt." 

"Whether Wilkinson was really in earnest in carry 
ing into execution the designs of the Spanish Gov 
ernor, may, by some, be regarded as a matter of con 
jecture ; but that he was, nevertheless, using him for 
pecuniary gain, is clearly established by Miro's frequent 
dispatches to the home government, recommending the 
purchase of increased amounts of tobacco, in which it 
was known that Wilkinson was then dealing. 

" There is no means," he writes, " more powerful to 
accomplish the principal object we have in view, in the 
memorial which has been laid before his Majesty, than 
the promise, that the government will take as much as 



MAJOR DUXN. 73 

six millions of their tobacco, instead of the two millions 
which are now bought from them." 

In a subsequent dispatch, after the arrival of several 
flat-boats, owned by "Wilkinson, and under charge of 
Major Dunn, which the Governor was assured cost seven 
thousand dollars in Kentucky, Miro says, that, from the 
beginning, Wilkinson had informed him that he was not 
possessed of any pecuniary resources ; that on the recom 
mendation of the Intendant, he had obtained a loan 
of three thousand dollars from a gentleman in New 
Orleans, and, therefore, requested that his cargo should 
not be seized, as he had pledged the product of its sale 
to refund the sum, and to pay his crew, and the amount 
due on the tobacco, which had been purchased on credit. 
The balance was to enable him to support himself with 
out embarrassment, and to contribute to preserve and 
increase his influence in his own State. " Although his 
candor," he continues, " and the information which I 
have sought from many who know him well, seem to 
assure us that he is working in good earnest, yet I am 
aware it may be possible that his intention is to enrich 
himself at our expense, by inflating us with hopes and 
promises which he knows to be vain. Nevertheless, I 
have determined to humor him on this occasion." 

Dunn had left Kentucky, in charge of the boats and 
cargo, on the 15th of May, bearing with him a letter of 
introduction from Wilkinson. He informed the Gov 
ernor and Intendant that the Major was an old military 
companion, who had come to settle in the country during 
his absence. The reliance which he placed in his honor, 
his discretion, and his talents, had induced him, after 



74 . THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

sounding his disposition with proper caution, to choose 
him as a fit auxiliary in the execution of their political 
designs, which he had embraced with credulity. Dunn, 
he said, would, therefore, present himself in order to 
confer with them on those points which would require 
more examination, and to concert with them those 
measures which they might deem necessary to expe 
dite " our" plan, and that, through him, he, Wilkinson, 
might he able to receive the new instructions which they 
might deem expedient to send him. " I have also chosen 
him, he continues, " to bring back the product of the 
present cargo of my boats." 

For these reasons, he wished to recommend him as one 
worthy of their entire confidence, and as a safe and saga 
cious man, who was properly acquainted with the poli 
tical state of the American Union, and with the circum 
stances of the Western country. 

He further informed them, that on the first day of 
January of the next year (1789), by mutual consent, the 
district of Kentucky would cease to be subject to the 
jurisdiction of Virginia. That while it was true it had 
been stipulated, as a necessary condition of their inde 
pendence, that Kentucky should be acknowledged as an 
independent State by Congress, and be admitted, as such, 
into the Federal Union, yet a convention had already 
been called to form the constitution of that district, and 
he felt persuaded that no action on the part of Congress 
would ever induce the people to abandon the plan which 
they had adopted, although he had received recent intel 
ligence that that body- would, beyond a doubt, recognize 
Kentucky as a sovereign State. 



PROJECTING. 75 

The convention was to meet in July ; and in the mean 
time he would inquire into the prevailing opinions, and 
should thereby be able to ascertain the extent of the 
influence of the members elected. When that was done, 
after having previously come to an understanding with 
two or three individuals capable of assisting him, he 
should disclose so much of their great scheme as might 
appear appropriate. He, as yet, had been communicative 
but to two individuals; he, however, had sounded many; 
and wherever he had made known to any of them Miro's 
answer to his memorial, it had given the greatest satis 
faction. Col. Alexander Leatt Bullitt, and Harry Innis, 
the Attorney-General, were the only persons to whom 
he had fully communicated; and should any mishap 
befall him before the accomplishment of their ends, he 
desired the Spanish authorities to adcjress themselves to 
these gentlemen, whose political designs, he asserted, 
agreed with their own. An early organization of the 
State government was anticipated, at which time it was 
intended to appoint an agent to treat with Spain ; and as 
for Congress opposing any obstacle to the measure, it 
was ridiculously absurd ; for under the federal compact, 
that body could neither furnish men nor money ; and, as 
to the new government, should it ever establish itself, it 
would have to encounter difficulties which would keep it 
weak for three or four years, before the expiration of 
which, he had good reason for believing, that himself 
and Miro would complete their negotiations, and would 
become too strong for any force that could be sent 
against them. 

Urging upon the authorities the great importance of 



76 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

permitting him to trade unmolested, and allowing but 
few individuals to pass duty free, he says : " The only 
tie which can- preserve the connection of the Western 
country with the Atlantic States, is the necessity of 
relying on them altogether for their supplies of such 
articles as are not manufactured by the people ; and as 
soon as they ascertain that these can be procured 
through the river, their dependent state will cease, 
and with it all motives of connection with the other 
side of the Apalachian mountains." 

Major Dunn confirmed the statement of Wilkinson, 
and assured Miro that the next year after the meeting 
of the first assembly, in which Kentucky would act as 
an independent State, she would separate from the Fed 
eral Union. He further assured the Governor, that 
many of the most distinguished citizens of the State 
had expressed themselves to that effect, and that the 
direction of the current of the rivers, which washes in 
front of their dwellings, pointed clearly to the power to 
which they should ally themselves. 

About this time Miro was much gratified at the receipt 
of a copy of a dispatch from McGillivray, the half-breed 
Chief of the Salapouches, to the Governor of Pensacola, 
in which he informed the Spanish official that the settlers 
in the Cumberland and Kentucky districts, against whom 
he had committed many atrocities, had sued for peace ; 
and, as an inducement to a cessation of hostilities, had 
"assured him that they would throw themselves into the 
arms of his Majesty, as subjects, and were determined 
to free themselves from their dependence on Congress, 
because that body could not protect either their persons 



DIPLOMACY. 77 

or their property, nor, by favoring commerce, promote 
their prosperity: hence they owed no obedience to a 
power which was incapable of benefiting them. 

Elated with the prospects of success, Miro's dispatches 
to the King spoke so encouragingly, and with such confi 
dence, that they did not fail to create high hopes in the 
breast of the Cabinet as to the favorable result of his 
plans. Martin Navarro, his associate, had left the prov 
ince for Spain, and Miro exercised in his own person the 
two offices of Intendant and Governor. No other person 
had been sent to supply his place ; it being deemed best 
to leave negotiations entirely with the few who had been 
admitted to the secret, lest Wilkinson and his associates 
might be exposed. 

Until now, Gardoqui and the Governor had been act 
ing separate parts. Both were ambitious to accomplish 
their projects, and both were emulous of the rewards 
which were to follow. Neither had communicated his 
secrets to the other, while both were struggling for a 
common design. With such privacy had they conducted 
their several schemes, that even Wilkinson was as yet 
uninformed of the secret agency of D'Args. Miro had 
failed to apprise him of it for fear of the displeasure it 
might occasion him and Gardoqui, through a distrust 
of the General, and a desire to accomplish his object 
without his co-operation. 

The diplomacy displayed by these two officials of his 
Majesty evinces talents of no ordinary ability. Both 
were dealing with an experienced tactician, who prided 
himself upon his superior sagacity. He had, as yet, 
gained neither the affection of the one, nor the confi- 



78 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

dence of the other. Both had read their antagonist, 
and conceived they knew the individual with whom they 
confederated. Miro had, therefore, to suppress a smile at 
Wilkinson's ingenuousness in communicating the fact 
that he had heen approached "by hoth French and Eng 
lish emissaries, who were husily engaged in enlisting, 
each in his own behalf, the interests of Kentucky. 

" It is to my knowledge," writes Wilkinson, that the 
Court of Versailles has, for years past, heen collecting 
every sort of information with reference to this district, 
and that it would give a great deal to recover its posses 
sions on the Mississippi. In the year 1785, a knight of 
St. Louis, named D'Arg&s, arrived at the falls of the 
Ohio, gave himself out for a naturalist, and pretended 
that his object was to inquire into the curious produc 
tions of this country, but his manner of living contra 
dicted his assertion. He made few acquaintances, lived 
very retired, and during one year that he remained here 
he never went out of Louisville, where he resided, fur 
ther than six miles. On his perusing the first memorial 
which the people of this district presented to the Legis 
lature of Virginia, on the question of separation, he 
expressed his admiration that there should be in so new 
a country, a writer capable of framing such a composi 
tion ; then, after having made some reflections on the 
progressive importance of our settlement, he exclaimed 
with enthusiasm, 'Good God! my country has been 
blind, but its eyes shall be opened/ The confidential 
friend of this gentleman was a Mr. Tardiveau, who had 
resided many years in Kentucky. D'ArgSs used to draw 
drafts on M. de Marbois, then Consul of France, at ISTew

York ; and, finally, he lived as one who belonged to the 
family of Count de Moustier, the French Minister; and 
I am informed, from a good source, that he presented to 
this same Count de Moustier, a very elaborate memorial 
on these settlements, which was forwarded to the Court 
of France. 

" Perhaps, sir," he continues, " you will think this 
information frivolous, but I am sure you will believe that 
it proceeds from my devoted zeal for the interests, of 
Spain. Please remember that trifles light as air, fre 
quently are, for the faithful and the zealous, proofs as 
strong as those of Holy "Writ." * This same D'Arges 
was then in the actual service of Gardoqui, under 
instructions from the Court of Madrid, and in conference 
with Miro. 

Wilkinson had been actively engaged in sowing the 
seeds of dissension in Kentucky. George Muter, Harry 
Innis, John Brown and Benjamin Sebastian, conspicuous 
and influential men, had been admitted to the secret, and 
were fully commit'ted to the enterprise. Possessing 
talents of marked ability themselves, they, nevertheless, 
looked to Wilkinson for counsel and direction. The 
people were kept in constant agitation by conventions 
and meetings on the subject of their grievances. The 
Secretary of State, Mr. Jay, it was asserted, had formed, 
or was about to form, a treaty with Spain, by which the 
exclusive right to navigate the Mississippi for twenty-five 
years, on the part of his Majesty, was to be recognized 
by the United States Government. Delegates had been

assembled from the principal counties of Kentucky, had 
discussed their grievances, and had separated without 
any organized plan. The people became distracted, their 
burthens became more and more intolerable ; and many 
seemed willing to resort to any thing that promised a 
present relief. It was true* that not a few of the evils of 
which they complained were imaginary some unavoid 
able perhaps all, in time, would have been satisfactorily 
adjusted ; yet they ^conceived themselves aggrieved, and 
it was the policy of their leaders to cultivate such a 
belief. 

Wilkinson had returned in February, 1788. He had 
sailed from New Orleans to Philadelphia ; visited Rich 
mond, Virginia ; was present in the Assembly when the 
separation of Kentucky was voted on, and was . greatly 
gratified when the result was announced. His entrance 
into Lexington was grand and imposing. He had left 
there poor and in debt, only the summer before, but now 
flourished in splendid chariot, drawn by four richly- 
caparisoned horses, and attended by several slaves.* 
Unfavorable rumors were freely circulated. By some, it 
was hinted that at New Orleans he had sold both his 
cargo and himself; that, in fact, he had taken the oath 
of allegiance, and had already become a subject of Spain. 
He informed them, himself, of the exclusive privileges 
granted him by the Governor, by which he could ship 
tobacco, and deposit it at the king's store at ten dollars 
the hundred, which was a privilege allowed only to his 
Majesty's subjects. He advocated the right to navigate

OBNOXIOUS FEDERALISM. 81 

the Mississippi, urged the great importance of a com 
mercial connection of the two countries, and insinuated 
that it might all he effected by a separation from the 
Union and the independence of Kentucky. Many were 
already convinced ; others felt that their prosperity had 
heen too long retarded by the inactivity of the Govern 
ment. "What has heen accomplished by Wilkinson," 
they argued, "may also be effected for ourselves." As 
yet they had derived no benefits from the Union ; but as 
an independent State they could form an alliance with 
Spain, and reap the advantages of her liberal patronage. 
The incredulous, of whom there were many, were reluct 
ant to move. Although they divined the object of Wil 
kinson's mission, still he stood high in popular favor, 
and they were cautious of giving offense. Some there 
were, who would have openly denounced him, but the 
facts upon which to base an accusation had been care 
fully concealed. By the multitude, however, his acts 
were highly extolled, and he .was flattered by the 
acknowledgement that to him alone were the citizens 
of the West indebted for opening that navigation, which 
Mr. Jay had offered to surrender, and of realizing that 
commerce which Congress had failed to secure. 

But there was a new cause of excitement which 
promised to facilitate his design. The merits of the new 
Constitution of the United States, which had been 
recently adopted by eleven States of the Union, was the 
subject of universal interest. The policy of its accept 
ance was daily discussed in bar-rooms, at the hust 
ings, and in social assemblies. Many of its provisions 

were known to be unpopular with a majority of the 
6 



82 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. , 

citizens of Kentucky, yet it was hoped that the objec 
tions might all be obviated by subsequent amendment. 
The people of the Kentucky district had been called 
upon to send delegates to Richmond, to meet in Conven 
tion in the month of June, at which time it was expected 
that Virginia would declare her sentiments upon the 
subject. The session was protracted for three weeks. 
At length a vote was taken, on the SOth of June, and 
the instrument ratified by a vote of eighty-eight to 
seventy-eight ; but three of the Kentucky members vot 
ing for it, while eleven declared against it. 

While the preliminary elections were being held, for 
members of the Convention at Richmond, the people 
were also required to select delegates to a District Con 
vention, to assemble at Danville, charged with the 
important trust of framing a Constitution for the new 
State. Wilkinson was chosen a member of that body. 
It convened on the 28th of July, and proceeded to 
organize. Its deliberations, however, were suddenly 
terminated, by the announcement of its president, that 
he had received a dispatch stating that Congress had 
declined any further action on the subject of Kentucky ; 
had, in fact, adjourned without having passed an act for 
her admission into the Confederation, and leaving the de 
cision, on that important question, to the Congress about 
to be formed under the recently-adopted Constitution.* 

" From this proceeding of Congress," writes Wilkin 
son to Miro, " it resulted that the Convention was of 
opinion that our proposed independence and separation

from Virginia, not being ratified, its mission and powers 
were at an end, and we found ourselves in the alternative, 
either of proceeding to declare our independence, or of 
waiting according to the recommendation of Congress. 
This was the state of affairs when the Honorable Caleb 
Wallace, one of our Supreme Judges, the Attorney Gen 
eral, Innis, and Benjamin Sebastian, proposed a prompt 
separation from the American Union, and advocated, 
with intrepidity, the necessity of the measure. The arti 
fice of Congress was exposed, its proceedings reprobated, 
the consequences of depending on a body whose interests 
were opposed to ours, were depicted in the most vivid 
colors, and the strongest motives were set forth to 
justify the separation. The arguments used were un 
answerable, and no opposition was manifested in the 
course of the debates. It was conceded, unanimously, 
that the present connection was injurious to our interests, 
and that it could not last any length of time. Never 
theless, sir, when the question was finally taken, fear and 
folly prevailed against reason and judgment. It was 
thought safer and more convenient to adhere to the 
recommendation of Congress, and, in consequence, it was 
decided that the people be advised to elect a new Con 
vention, which should meet in the mouth of November."* 
" To consolidate the interest and confirm the confi 
dence of our friends ; to try our strength ; to familiarize 
the people with what we aim at ; to dissipate the appre 
hension which important innovations generally produce, 
and to provoke the resentment of Congress, with a view

84 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to stimulate that body into some invidious political act 
which might excite the passions of the people ; these are 
the motives which influence me, and on which I rely for 
my justification." 

Wilkinson's solicitude for the measure at length 
became so apparent, that it excited the suspicions of 
the people. But, judicious in selection of his agents 
adroit in pushing others forward, wnile he, the arch 
mover, concealed himself behind the screen of secrecy, 
corresponding monthly with the Spanish authorities, and 
forwarding volumes of plans and information respecting 
affairs, not only in Kentucky, but throughout the United 
States, he presents an unparalleled success in the art of 
traitorous diplomacy. 

General Morgan was now actually in league with the 
Spanish authorities. He had accepted his grant ; had 
surveyed the land, and laid out the town of New Madrid. 
It was a princely donation, extending from the mouth 
of the St. Francis to point Cinque Hommes, embracing 
from twelve to fifteen million of acres. Already had 
fifty adventurous settlers planted themselves in this 
garden of the Western wilderness. But the settlement 
presented a serious impediment to Wilkinson's progress. 
It was too near the scene of his own operations not to 
become familiar with his intrigues ; besides, it was 
known that the town had been purposely established to 
intercept descending trade, for which reason it had been 
declared a free port of entry. " Probably," says Wil 
kinson to Miro,* "it will destroy the noble fabric of 

* Gayarre's History of Louisiana, Vol. III., p. 244. 



SATAN REPROVING SIN. 85 

which we have laid out the foundation, and which we 
are endeavoring to complete." 

" I am informed," he continues, " that Morgan intends , 
visiting you as soon as he shall have finished the survey 
of the lands conceded to him. Permit me to supplicate 
you, my esteemed friends, not to give him any knowl 
edge of my plans, sentiments, or designs. It is long 
since he has become jealous of me; and you may rest 
assured that, in reality, he is not well affected toward 
our cause, but that he allows himself to be entirely 
ruled by motives of the vilest self-interest, and, there 
fore, that he will not scruple on his return to destroy 
me." 

That Morgan was prompted by the incentive with 
which he had been charged, Miro did not feel disposed 
to question. Men were only to be influenced in such an 
undertaking by the strongest considerations of private 
advantage. In fact, it was to that interest only he 
appealed, and by it alone he could hope for success. 
But, emanating from such a source, it was Satan reprov 
ing sin. Himself a soldier and officer of the Revolution, 
who had passed successfully through many a scene of 
doubtful conflict ; who, at the sacrifice of his private for 
tune, and at the imminent peril of his life, had aided 
in effecting the independence of that country he now 
secretly conspired against ; who had received her honors, 
her confidence, and her gratitude ; was not he himself 
now seeking, for Spanish influence and Spanish gold, to 
tear down the noble fabric he had helped to rear, and 
transfer to Spanish despotism those liberties for which so 
gallantly he had fought? "It is not necessary," says 



86 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Wilkinson to Gardoqui,* " to suggest to a gentleman of 
your experience and knowledge that man throughout the 
world is governed by private interest, however variously 
modified it may be. Some men are avaricious, some are 
vain, some are ambitious. To detect the predominant 
passion, to lay hold, and to make the most of it, is 
the most profound secret of political science." 

Wilkinson's object was too transparent not to be 
detected by the penetration of Miro. " Some men are 
avaricious, some are vain, some ambitious." Wilkinson, 
he knew, combined the whole. " Hundreds," says he in 
a subsequent letter,f " have applied to me on this subject 
who are determined to follow my example ; and I do 
not deceive myself, nor do I deceive you, sir, when I 
affirm that it is in my power to lead a large body of 
the most opulent and most respectable of my fellow- 
citizens whither I shall go myself at their head ; and I 
flatter myself that, after the dangers I have run, and 
the sacrifices which I have made after having put my 
honor and my life in your hands you can have no 
doubt of my favorable disposition toward the interests 
of his Catholic Majesty, so long as my poor services 
may be necessary." 

" After having read these remarks, you will be sur 
prised at being informed that, lately, I have, jointly 
with several gentlemen of this country, applied to Don 
Diego Gardoqui for a concession of land, in order to 
form a settlement on the Yazoo. The motive of this

BRITISH INTRIGUE. 87 

application is to provide a place of refuge for myself and 
my adherents, in case it should become necessary for us 
to retire from this country in order to avoid the resent 
ment of Congress." 

In the meantime, the attention of the representatives 
of the British Government had been attracted toward 
the intrigues of the Spanish authorities with some of 
the more influential citizens of the West. It had been 
currently reported, that a severance from the Union had 
been determined on, and that the people were ready to 
throw themselves into the arms of any power which 
would protect them from Indian hostilities, and guar 
antee the free navigation of the Mississippi. 

A Doctor Connally was deputed by Dorchester, Gov 
ernor of Canada, to visit Kentucky and ascertain the 
disposition of the people. He arrived at Louisville in 
the month of October, 1788, having traveled through 
the wilderness from Detroit to the Great Miami, and 
thence down the Ohio. He gave attentive audience to 
the numerous complaints of the citizens, and suggested 
a plan by which they could relieve themselves from 
the embarrassments which the neglect of Congress had 
thrown around them. Great Britain, he asserted, was 
desirous to assist American settlers in their claim to the 
free navigation of the river. She would join them, with 
zeal, to open up this avenue of trade, and wrest from the 
Spanish Crown the Territory of Louisiana. Although 
the forces in Canada were too few to allow of any dimi 
nution of their number, yet Dorchester stood ready to 
supply the implements of war, and would equip ten 
thousand men with money, provisions and clothing. 



88 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

As soon as the plan of action should be agreed upon, 
these articles would be forwarded from Detroit, through 
Lake Erie, to the Miami, and thence to the Wabash, to 
be transported to any point on the Ohio where the neces 
sities of the case might require. A fleet of light vessels 
would be ready at Jamaica, to take possession of the 
Balize, simultaneously with an attack to be made by the 
upper settlements. He desired to raise two regiments in 
Kentucky, and was authorized by Dorchester to confer 
rewards and honors on the men of influence who might 
desire to join him. Officers of the late Continental 
army who would take command, should rank the same 
in grade with the officers of Great Britain.* 

The proposition of Connally met with little encour 
agement. Dorchester had incited the hostilities of 
Indians against the Government of the United States, 
and the inhabitants of the West had been the chief 
sufferers/ Their desolated homes were yet draped in 
mourning for the victims of savage barbarity. Their 
wounds were too fresh, and their resentment too impla 
cable, easily to forget the sanguinary authors of their 
sorrow, or to forgive their not less cruel abettors. Wil 
kinson had heard of Connally's arrival, and wrote him, 
requesting an interview. His object was to penetrate his 
designs, that they might be communicated to the Span 
ish Governor. Connally was unsuspecting, and revealed 
his plans without reserve. Wilkinson listened atten 
tively, and was surprised at the boldness of his measures 
and the extent of his ambition. Great Britain was not

only contemplating a recovery of her American possess 
ions, lost to her at the conventions of Utrecht and Aix 
la Chapelle, but, also, the extension of their limits to 
the Gulf of Mexico. His own interests were not less 
involved in the scheme than those of Spain; for with 
the loss of Spanish empire followed the loss, to him, of 
Spanish favor and contemplated fortune. It was import 
ant to check the enterprise ; hut it was equally import 
ant to avoid suspicion, and give no offence to Connally. 
He desired to impress him with the implacability of pri 
vate resentment, and the impossibility of an English 
alliance. The manner of its accomplishment is com 
municated to Miro in his letter of the 12th of Feb 
ruary, 1789.* 

" In order to justify this opinion of mine, and to 
induce him to go back, I employed a hunter, who 
feigned attempting his life. The pretext assumed by 
the hunter was the avenging of the death of his son, 
murdered by the Indians at the supposed instigation of 
the English. As I hold the commission of a civil judge, 
it was, of course, to be my duty to protect him against 
the pretended murderer, whom I caused to be arrested 
and held in custody. I availed myself of this circum 
stance to communicate to Connally my fear of not 
being able to answer for the security of his person, and 
I expressed my doubts whether he could escape with his 
life. It alarmed him so much, that he begged me to 
give him an escort to conduct him out of our territory, 
which I readily assented to ; and on the 20th of ]!N"ovem-

ber tie re-crossed the Ohio on his way back to Detroit. I 
did not dismiss him without having previously impressed 
upon him the propriety of informing me, in as short a 
time as possible, of the ultimate designs of Lord Dor 
chester." 

To induce emigration and trade, the Spanish Gov 
ernment, contrary to the remonstrances of Wilkinson, 
finally consented that the products of the upper coun 
try might pass through the Mississippi on the payment 
of a duty of fifteen per cent. This, as he had foretold, 
operated to retard the progress of his plans. With the 
prospect of a ready market, labor resumed its wonted 
activity, and the murmurs of the people were silenced. 
Lands rose rapidly in value, wages were increased, and 
the pursuits of agriculture promised an adequate return 
for the capital employed. Apprehensive of having it 
perish on their hands, they had heretofore been deterred 
from raising more than the consumption of the imme 
diate neighborhood demanded ; " but now," said Wil 
kinson,* "they have .no longer any such fears, on 
account of the ready outlet they find, at New Orleans, 
for the fruits of their labor." 

Other circumstances, too, were rapidly combining to 
allay the public discontent. As a measure of policy, the 
President had distributed a few of the public offices 
among those who were regarded as disaffected toward 
the Government, and whose loyalty might be purchased 
as readily by the bestowal of executive favor as by the 
tempting promises of Spanish gold. "On my arrival

COVERING RETREAT. Gl 

here,'* writes Wilkinson to Miro,* " I discovered a great 
change in those who had been so far our warmest friends. 
Many who loudly repudiated all connection with the 
Union, now remain silent. I attribute this to the hope 
of promotion, or to the fear of punishment. According 
to my prognostic, Washington has begun to operate on 
the chief heads of this district. Innis has been appointed 
a Federal Judge, with an annual salary of one thousand 
dollars; George Nicholas, District Attorney; Samuel 
McDowel, son of the President of the Convention, and 
Marshall, to offices somewhat resembling that of Alguazil 
Mayor; and Peyton Short, the brother of our chargd 
d'affaires at Versailles, is made a Custom-house officer ; 
but he has resigned, and . will, probably visit you next 
spring. I do not place much reliance on George Mcholas 
and Samuel McDowel. But I know Harry Innis is 
favorable to Spain and hostile to Congress, and I am 
authorized to say, that he would prefer receiving a pen 
sion from New Orleans than from New York. Should 
the king approve our design, on this point, it will have 
to be broached with much delicacy, caution and judg 
ment." He adds : " I fear that we can rely on a few 
only of my countrymen, if we can not make use of 
liberal donations." 

But Wilkinson's apprehensions began now to be 
excited for his own safety. If he was to be thus aban 
doned by his associates, and his plans defeated by the 
admission of Kentucky into the Union, some provision 
was necessary by which to escape the odium of defeat. 

*26th January, 1790. Gayarre, Vol. Ill, p. 278. 



92 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The monopoly of the upper trade had been swept from 
his grasp by the last act of the Court at Madrid. It had 
placed on terms of equality all who possessed the capital 
and energy to compete for the patronage of the Spanish 
Government. Scores of boats, laden with the products 
of the country, were pouring their commerce into the 
lap of New Orleans. The new Constitution proved much 
more popular than was generally anticipated, and was, 
day by day, increasing in favor with the people. Wash 
ington, too, the illustrious commander in the Revolution, 
was now the chosen chief of the Union, and his selection 
had inspired a spirit of loyalty which it was difficult, 
nay, dangerous to tamper with. Already had Wilkinson 
been marked as a traitor, and spies were vigilant in seek 
ing the evidences of his intrigue. " My situation," says 
he,* " is mortally painful ; because, while I abhor du 
plicity, I am obliged to dissemble. This makes me 
extremely desirous of resorting to some contrivance 
that will put me in a position in which I flatter myself 
to be able to profess myself publicly the vassal of his 
Catholic Majesty, and, therefore, to claim his protection 
in whatever public or private measures I may devise to 
promote the interest of the Crown." " You may rest 
assured," he adds, " that the constant persecutions of 
Congress can not produce the slightest impression on my 
attachment and zeal for the interests of Spain, which I 
shall always be ready to defend with my tongue, my pen 
and my sword" 

It would be presumed that Miro would gladly have

93 

assented to the proposition, and suggested the " contriv 
ance " by which to have secured him " a vassal of Spain," 
but the Spanish Governor knew too well that Wilkin 
son's power to subserve his Majesty's interest, lay in his 
connection with the people of Kentucky, and his intimate 
knowledge of the affairs of the Federal Government. 
For were it once understood he had become a subject 
of Spain, he would, of necessity, be excluded from par 
ticipation in their affairs, and his influence lost to the 
interest of Louisiana. 

" I much regret," replied Miro,* " that General Wash 
ington and Congress suspect your connection with me, 
but it does not appear to me opportune that you declare 
yourself a Spaniard, for the reason which you state. I 
am of opinion that this idea of yours is not convenient, 
and that, on the contrary, it might have prejudicial results. 
Therefore, continue to dissemble, and to work as you 
promise, and as I have above indicated. 

Miro now began to feel gloomy forebodings of the 
result. Wilkinson's late communication had dampened 
his hopes, and rendered him suspicious even of the Gen 
eral himself. He was either the victim of punic faith, or 
his American emissary had been himself deceived. Yet 
he was reluctant to believe that Wilkinson, although 
willing to become a traitor to the Union, could also 
prove a traitor to Spain. Perhaps an over- weening con 
fidence had induced him to promise what he never could 
perform. It might be that, full of zeal, and persuaded, 
from the experience of the past, that he could bring

94 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

round to his own opinions the chief men of Kentucky, 
he had declared in anticipation that he had won over 
many of them. But still, it was a fact, that he had never 
once approached them on the main question, and now 
that encountering invincible obstacles and, above all, 
personal risks, it might be his desire to avail himself of 
the motive set forth in his letter to cover his precipitation. 

" Nevertheless," said Miro, " I am of the opinion that 
said Brigadier-General ought to be retained in the service 
of his Majesty, with an annual pension of two thousand 
dollars, which I have already proposed in my confidential 
dispatch, No. 46,* because the inhabitants of Kentucky, 
and of the other establishments on the Ohio, will not be 
able to undertake any thing against this province with 
out his communicating it to us, and without his. making, 
at the same time, all possible efforts to drive them from 
any bad designs against us, as he has already done re 
cently. Miro concludes, by recommending that a pension 
be granted to Sebastian, " because I think it proper" said 
he, " to treat with this individual who will be able to enlighten 
me on the conduct of Wilkinson, and on what we have to 
expect from the plans of the said Brigadier- General" 

We have at length arrived at a point in the history of 
this intrigue which renders it unnecessary to pursue it 
further. The key is disclosed which unlocks the door 
of mystery, and reveals other truths which for half a 
2entury have been enveloped in darkness and in doubt ; 
Wilkinson pensioned to guard the interests of Spain, and 
Sebastian to betray his confederate Wilkinson. 

*Gayarre, Vol. Ill, p. 286. 



STILL TROUBLED. 95 

Time rolled on. Kentucky had been admitted into 
the Union, as an independent State. Wilkinson bore 
the commission of a Lieutenant-Colonel, signed by 
George Washington, and was in actual command of the 
American forces. The announcement of his appoint 
ment spread consternation among his enemies, and elated 
his confederates. The question was repeatedly asked, 
"By whom was he recommended?" "By myself/' 
replied Col. Marshall, who had been his most formida 
ble opponent. He considered Wilkinson, he said, well 
qualified for the commission he bore; that while he 
remained unemployed by Government, he regarded him 
as dangerous to the tranquillity of Kentucky, perhaps to 
her absolute safety. If his commission did not secure 
his fidelity, it would place him under control, in the 
midst of faithful officers, whose vigilance would make 
him harmless, if it did not make him honest. Wilkin 
son would not be permitted to command the army while 
there existed a doubt of his integrity, and General 
Washington remained as President of the Republic. At 
all events, he could see no good reason for not putting 
the lion in the toils which he himself had solicited.* 

Although the admission of Kentucky into the Union 
for a time silenced the complaints of the people, yet it 
failed to restore a unity of sentiment and concert of action. 
The navigation of the Mississippi was still the subject of 
discord, not only between the authorities of Louisiana, 
and the western inhabitants of the States, but also 
between the mother country and the American Repub-

lie. Negotiations had been protracted, misunderstandings 
had ensued, and an imbittered diplomatic controversy 
threatened a collision of arms between the contending 
countries. Miro, after a service of twenty years, had 
been recalled to Spain, at his own request, and the gov 
ernment of the province committed to the Baron de 
Carondolet. Louis Sixteenth had perished on the scaf 
fold, and Charles the Third, as the avenger of his death, 
had declared war against his ruthless executioners. The 
astounding news of the French Revolution had crossed 
the Atlantic and penetrated the forests of the western 
hemisphere. It gave new hopes to the friends of free 
dom in Europe, and fresh impetus to the cause of liberty 
throughout the civilized world. 

Genet, the representative of the French Republic, had 
not been a disinterested spectator of the intrigues of 
Spain. His mind involuntarily reverted to that unfortu 
nate day when the King of France, grown disgusted 
with a possession which, for more than half a century, 
had been the cause of heavy expense, without giving 
even a faint promise of adequate compensation in the 
future, ceded to his cousin the King of Spain, without 
any remuneration whatever, but merely from the pure 
impulses of his generous heart, and from a sense of the 
affection and friendship which existed between them, all 
the country known under the name of Louisiana ; thus, 
by one stroke of the pen, stripping France " of those 
boundless possessions which she had acquired at the cost 
of so much heroic blood and so much treasure, and 
which extended in one proud, uninterrupted line from 
the mouth of the St. Lawrence to that of the Mississippi ;

the adventurous and much-enduring population which 
had settled there, and had overcome so many perils, 
under the flag of France, coldly delivered over to the 
yoke of foreign masters." He heard yet the prayerful 
remonstrance of the citizens of New Orleans against the 
impolitic and ungrateful usurpation. In a retrospect of 
the past he saw the venerable Bienville, with a hody bent 
by the infirmities of eighty-six years, yet with his intel

Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists 

From the mighty Atlantic 
Looked on the happy valley," 

and who had, 

" Friendless, homeless, hopeless, wandered from 

City to city; 
From the cold lakes of the North to 

Sultry savannas; 
From the bleak shores of the sea, to the land 

Where the Father of Waters 
Seizes the hills in his hands, and 

Drags them down to the ocean." 

How they wept on the receipt of the intelligence that 
they were again transferred to a foreign power against 
their consent and without their knowledge ; how Lafr- 
rilere and his followers had defied the authorities of 
Spain, and declared never to acknowledge any domin 
ion but that of their own beloved France ; how they 
took possession of the government, and were only sub 
dued by the appearance at the Balize of a Spanish 
Armada under the renowned 0'B.eiley. He had reason 
for believing that a remnant of that feeling still existed 
among the French settlers in Louisiana ; and although 
years had elapsed, and most, if not all, who had been 
the actors in those scenes had passed away, yet it was 
believed that their recollections were still green by tra 
dition, and their descendants still cherished an affection 
for the land of their forefathers ; and now that France 
had become the champion of free governments and 
republican liberty, more than ever would they long for 
her dominion, or seek her protection in any effort they 



GENET. 99 

might make to secure a like government for them 
selves. 

Genet, therefore, set himself privately to work to 
effect a revolution in Louisiana; hoping, with the aid 
of the western settlers, to establish an independent 
government under the protection of France. At his 
instance, Jacobin clubs were formed in many of the 
principal cities of the United States, which were to be 
the active agencies for effecting this purpose. The 
society at Philadelphia, in the beginning of the year 
1794, had caused to be printed and circulated an address 
from the freemen of France to their brothers in Louisi 
ana. In this they declared that the moment had arrived 
when despotism must disappear from the earth ; that 
France, having obtained her freedom, and constituted 
herself into a Republic, after having made known to 
mankind their rights, after having achieved the most 
glorious victories over her enemies, was not satisfied 
with success, by which she alone would profit, but 
declared to all nations that she was ready to give her 
powerful assistance to those that might desire to follow 
her example ; that the French nation, knowing their sen 
timents, and indignant at seeing them the victims of 
the tyrants by whom they had been so long oppressed, 
could and would avenge their wrongs. " Now is the 
time," continues the address, " to cease being slaves of a 
government to which you were shamefully sold, and no 
longer to be led on, like a* herd of cattle, by men who, 
with one word, can strip you of what you hold most, 
dear liberty and property." 

Recapitulating a long catalogue of grievances to 



100 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

which their brothers had been subjected, they say : 
" You quiver, no doubt, with indignation. You feel 
in your hearts the desire of deserving the honorable 
appellation of freemen ; but the fear of not having 
assistance, and of failing in your attempt, deadens your 
zeal. Dismiss your apprehensions ; and know ye that 
your brethren, the French, who have attacked with 
success the Spanish Government in Europe, will in a 
short time present themselves on your coast with naval 
forces ; that the republicans of the western portion of 
the United States are ready to come down the Ohio 
and Mississippi, in company with a considerable num 
ber of French republicans, and to rush to your assist 
ance, under the banners of France and Liberty, and 
that you have every assurance of success. Therefore, 
inhabitants of Louisiana, show who you are; prove 
that you have not been stupefied by despotism, and 
that you have retained in your breasts French valor 
and intrepidity. Demonstrate that you are worthy of 
being free and independent, because we do not solicit 
you to unite yourselves with us, but to seek your own 
freedom. When you shall have the sole control of your 
own actions, you will be able to adopt a republican con 
stitution, and, being assisted by France, as long as your 
weakness will not permit you to protect or defend your 
selves, it will be in your power to unite voluntarily with ' 
her and your neighbors, the United States, forming with 
these two Republics an alliance which will be the liberal 
basis on which, henceforth, shall stand our mutual politi 
cal and commercial interests. Your country will derive 
the greatest advantages from so auspicious a revolution ; 



G. ROGERS CLARK. 101 

and the glory with which you will cover yourselves, will 
equal the prosperity which you will secure for the coun 
try and for posterity. Away with pusillanimity; Ca ira! 
ca ira ! audaces fortuna juvat." 

Genet also dispatched Lachaise and Michaux to Ken 
tucky, to organize a force which was to descend the 
Mississippi to ~New Orleans, and act in concert with the 
French inhabitants. The time of their arrival in the 
country was peculiarly propitious. They found the peo 
ple divided in political sentiment, but all insisting on free 
navigation. Jacobin clubs were organized, and inflam 
matory appeals were issued, setting forth the grievous 
burthens under which they continued to labor. Too 
long, they asserted, had the citizens of the West placed 
implicit dependence on the impartiality and virtue of 
the General Government. Patient under the ungener-. 
ous local policy by which that government had been 
uniformly actuated; patient under the delays which it 
had feigned, and the obstacles which it had opposed to 
the procurement of their rights ; patient under the for 
ever-to-be-detested attempt to barter away that right; 
they had hitherto submitted to the oppressive exactions 
of the jealous Spaniards, and had not even raised their 
faltering voices to say to the arbiters of their fate : " You 
have done amiss." " Awake," they exclaimed, " from 
your lethargy! think and act for yourselves. Let the 
example of FRANCE and her glorious success animate 
you in the pursuit of those advantages which nature 
has bestowed upon your country." 

General George Rogers Clark, a man of distinguished 
military merit, then a prominent citizen of Kentucky, 



102 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

had been commissioned, by Genet, a Major- General in 
the French Revolutionary Legions on the Mississippi, 
with power to name and commission other officers, and 
to raise a military force for the reduction of the Spanish 
posts on that river ; to open its trade, and give Freedom 
to its inhabitants. 

All persons serving the expedition were to receive one 
thousand acres of land ; those engaging for one year, two 
thousand ; and an enlistment of two years, or during the 
war with France, three thousand acres. Officers were 
to receive in proportion to other French troops ; lawful 
plunder was to be equally divided according to the cus 
toms of war, and every precaution taken to secure the 
safe return of those who might wish to quit the service. 
France was to supply the munitions of war, and commis 
sions to grade according to the number that each could 
bring into the service. 

Genet had also sent his emissaries to other States in 
the South and West, who had been successful in stimu 
lating a spirit of adventure among many of the inhabi 
tants. In Tennessee, and on the frontiers of Georgia, it 
was reported that large forces were being assembled, 
who, it was expected, would act in concert with the 
Creek warriors, in a descent upon the Spanish dominions. 

Thus, through the energy of the French plenipoten 
tiary, had a formidable expedition been set on foot for 
the subjugation of Louisiana, with the declared purpose 
of revolutionizing her institutions, and rendering her an 
independent Republic, with Genet as its recognized head. 

Of this new enterprise against the interests of Spain, 
Wilkinson and his adherents were silent, but not careless, 



WASHINGTON EMBARRASSED. 103 

observers. Although then holding the commission of a 
lieutenant-colonel in the army of the United States, and, 
as was surmised, a secret pensioner of his Catholic 
Majesty, he neither openly encouraged nor publicly con 
demned the contemplated expedition. The terms of the 
address, the grievances enumerated, and the measures 
of relief proposed, were almost in the exact language 
with which it had been his custom to inflame the peo 
ple, except the new idea of wresting from Spain her 
possessions in Louisiana. 

In the mean time, rumors of the projected design hav 
ing reached the ears of the President, General Washing 
ton issued his instructions to Generals Wayne and St. 
Clair, as also the Governor Shelby, of Kentucky, com 
manding them immediately to suppress any movement 
having for its aim any attack against the Spanish domin 
ions. The reply of the latter caused the executive and 
his cabinet much concern. They feared that Shelby 
himself had either given in his adhesion to the cause, or 
was privately disposed to countenance its execution. 

The great sympathy which was manifested for the 
friends of liberty in France a deep sense of gratitude for 
her generous aid in the American Revolution, together 
with a lawless spirit of adventure in many of the more 
restless and discontented leaders of the country, rendered 
the extent of Genet's influence among the people a matter 
of painful uncertainty to the President. He felt his situa 
tion to be one of embarrassment. While he conceived 
it to be the true policy of the Government to observe a 
strict neutrality between the contending powers of Europe, 
<here was, nevertheless, a large party, with powerful 



104 THE BLEXNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

leaders at their head, who differed from him in opinion, 
and who openly declared their sympathy for the masses 
contending against despotism in the old world. Again, 
it was a fact, that having successfully thrown off the 
authority of Great Britain, many were impatient of 
restraint, and yielded, at most, a reluctant obedience to 
the power of the new Government. Yet, while these 
symptoms of revolt were manifesting themselves in 
several parts of the country, and seemed to threaten 
the stability and security of the Union, they stimulated 
Washington to stricter vigilance and more decisive 
action. He feared the influence of Genet's rash and 
revolutionary design, condemned his interference with 
the peaceful relations of the United States, and demanded 
his recall. Anxious to harmonize the interests of every 
section of the confederacy, he considered that amicable 
relations with European powers were indispensable to 
the prosperity, if not to the existence, of the Union itself. 
General Wayne was therefore ordered to repair immedi 
ately to Massac, on the Ohio, to construct a military fort 
and intercept any descending force hostile to Louisiana. 

These and other effective measures on the part of the 
executive, together with the condemnation and recall of 
the French minister, served to disband the enterprise, 
and, for a time, restore tranquillity to the country. Thus 
were the citizens of the West, for a period of several 
years, kept in constant agitation by the intrigues of 
foreign powers, aided by the disaffection of a few ambi 
tious spirits, who, for personal aggrandizement, were 
willing to sacrifice their own integrity, and their coun 
try's welfare. 



CLOUDS GATHERING. 105 



CHAPTER VI. 

EIGHT years had already elapsed since Blennerhassett 
had made the island his residence. The flowers and 
shrubbery planted by his hands had now sprang up in 
luxuriant perfection, and regaled the senses with their 
fragrance. The products of his husbandry secured at 
least a comfortable supply of all the necessaries of life, 
and more than this would have been superfluous. The 
independence of his situation enabled him to procure any 
or all of the delicacies which a more epicurean taste 
might have desired ; but these had been resigned, with 
the pomp and glitter of his former station. Around him 
he viewed a contented family, rejoicing in the buoyancy 
of health, and with the sprightliness of youthful vivacity. 
The returning seasons brought with them returning 
pleasures. New scenes of interest, new engagements, 
and wider fields of usefulness, daily presented themselves 
to his awakening impulses ; but, in the midst of all this 
peace and cheerfulness this " constant sunshine of the 
soul " a dark and portentous cloud gathered in the hori 
zon of his effulgent future, destined soon to burst with 
sad fatality upon the unsuspecting circle of his house 
hold. 

In the spring of 1805, Aaron Burr, late Vice-President 
of the United States, after the closing of the session of 



106 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Congress, set out on a journey through the Western 
States. The object of this tour, although never definitively 
declared, was doubtless three-fold : 

First. To ascertain the sentiments of the people of 
the West upon the subject of a separation from the At 
lantic States. 

Secondly. To enlist recruits, and make arrangements 
for a private expedition against Mexico and the Spanish 
provinces, in the event of a war between the United 
States and Spain, which at that time seemed inevitable. 

Thirdly. In the event of a failure of both of these 
measures, to purchase a tract of land of Baron Bastrop, 
lying in the Territory of Louisiana, on the Washita river. 
Upon this, he contemplated the establishment of a colony 
of intelligent and wealthy individuals, where he might 
rear around him a society remarkable for its refinement 
in civil and social life. That each of these stupendous 
enterprises was determined on, is clearly inferable from 
the evidence afterward adduced against him. 

With a mind tortured by remorse for the unfortunate 
duel with Hamilton, sickened by disappointment in polit 
ical preferment, disgusted with the more pacific measures 
of Jefferson, he could only direct his thoughts in scenes* 
of outward conflict, and bury the disquietudes which 
were tearing his soul, by plunging into deeds of wonder 
ful magnitude. 

Knowing full well the advantages which wealth and 
influence would add to either undertaking, he sought first 
to secure the co-operation of the most conspicuous char 
acters of the country. Blennerhassett was a shining 
treasure, too valuable to remain unnoticed a gentleman 



THE EMMETTS. 107 

of opulence and ease, possessing a mind of superior scien 
tific acquirements ; and who, from the discontents of his 
own country, it would readily be presumed, was well 
acquainted with military tactics ; such a personage would 
indeed prove a powerful auxiliary in any measure he had 
proposed to himself. Burr, accordingly, landed at the 
island, and, in company with a Mr. Shaw, strolled over 
this far-famed paradise. The family were absent from 
home on a visit to the East. Having partaken of the 
hospitality of those left in charge, Burr re-embarked on 
board of his boat, and proceeded down the river to view 
the country and hold conferences with the inhabitants at 
various points. 

General Wilkinson, who commanded the western forces, 
was, at that time, temporarily at Fort Massac, near 
the mouth of the Ohio. As a previous correspondence 
had been held between them, which had brought them 
into intimate relations, 'Burr wished to ascertain with 
what confidence he could rely on the aid of that officer 
and his men, in the event of an expedition to Mexico. 
The result of that interview has never been definitely 
ascertained ; it was strongly suspected, however, that 
Wilkinson assured him of his support. Here, the Ex- 
Vice-President was furnished by the General with an^ 
elegant barge, sails, colors, and ten oars, with a sergeant 
and ten able hands to prosecute his journey. 

About this time, Blennerhassett, having received intel 
ligence of the arrival in New York of his classmate and 
friend, the celebrated Thomas Addis Emmett,* who had 

* There were three Emmetts, sons of Dr. Emmett, who had been State- 
physician at Dublin, and was an extreme liberal in his political opinions. 



108 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

been compelled to flee his country by reason of serious po 
litical difficulties, hastened to meet him. The feelings of 
the exiles, as they again clasped hands on the western bor 
ders of the* Atlantic, can only be fully appreciated by those 
who have experienced similar vicissitudes. Here he found 
one with whom he could freely sympathize, and who, in 
return, could as freely sympathize with him. Often, in 
early life, had they sported together over the same green 
meadows, and participated in the same amusements. And 
when, at a more advanced age, they had been honorable 
competitors for academic honors, no selfish ambition had 
served to loose the bonds which early childhood welded, 
although the contest was never so spirited, or the prize 
was never so dazzling. Still later in life, they had deplored 
together the fate of their country ; had witnessed her deep 
degradation, and sighed over the hopeless prospects which 
were shadowed in the distant future. After several 
weeks spent with his friend, during which time he re 
newed his former acquaintance in the city, he returned to 
his family on the island. 

But a short time previous, a young man by the name 
of Harte, the son of an acquaintance in Ireland, having 



Temple, the eldest, who distinguished himself in the university and at the 
'bar, died at the age of thirty. Thomas Addis, born in 1764, also became 
a barrister, got involved in the revolt of 1798, was allowed to expatriate 
himself, arrived at New York in 1804, where he was at once admitted to 
practice (by special dispensation, although opposed, Phillips says, by 
Chancellor Kent), became attorney-general of New York in 1812, and died 
in 1827, greatly respected and lamented. Robert, who was only twenty- 
three years old, joined in the insurrection of 1808; was tried, condemned 
and executed lamented even by multitudes who disliked his politics. 
Robert Emmett's defense, as it is called, though actually spoken after his 
condemnation, when called on to receive judgment, is one of the most 
touching specimens of eloquence ever uttered. Mackenzie. 



IMPOSED UPON. 109 

applied to Blennerhassett for pecuniary aid, presented a 
letter of introduction, purporting to have been written 
by his father. His address was that of a gentleman, and 
the respectability of his family connection precluded any 
doubt as to the truthfulness of his representations. Pre 
vious to his departure from England, he said, he had 
taken the precaution to obtain drafts in London, on a 
house in Boston, for the sum of one thousand pounds ; 
that on his arrival in the United States he found the 
house to be fictitious ; that as this was his sole reliance 
he had been left entirely destitute of funds. He thought 
that he should not be chargeable with carelessness, as he 
had previously advised with Sir Owen Hunt, who had 
assured him that the gentleman with whom he dealt was 
a man of strict integrity. The story was a plausible one, 
and Blennerhassett, desirous of performing an act of 
charity toward the young gentleman, furnished him with 
letters of credit and introduction to many of his influ 
ential acquaintances, among which was one to Colonel 
Burr, and another to the Hon. James Brown, a brother- 
in-law of the colonel. From the various sources to 
whom he had been accredited, Harte obtained large sums 
of money, and fled to Canada. It subsequently appeared 
that he had forged the letter of introduction to Blenner 
hassett, and, at the time 'of his appearance at the island, 
was an exile from his father's house for similar practices 
in England. On being advised of the facts by Mr. Brown, 
Blennerhassett addressed him the following reply : 



110 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

WOOD COURT-HOUSE, VA., 

December 9th, 1805. 
JAMES BROWN, ESQ., 

DEAR SIR : On my arrival home yesterday evening, I 
received your two letters of the 13th and 18th August 
last, which have laid at the office here, I know not how 
long. By them I fear you have no effects of Harte's in 
your possession, as you do not mention the horses I un 
derstood, hy Mr. Shaw, he left with you, which, with the 
presumption I had requested you to indorse his drafts to 
an amount not exceeding a thousand or twelve hundred 
dollars, induced me, as I wrote you November 7th, from 
ISTew York, to risk the return of one of the drafts you 
indorsed for one thousand dollars. But your letters re 
ceived here, have caused me the utmost concern, lest I 
should not be in time by to-morrow's post to advise Mr. 
Morton, as Mr. Clay has suggested, to arrest the draft be 
fore its return upon you, though I am persuaded my 
proteg has altered my figures, which, indeed, would make 
no difference to your disadvantage, if he had done so to 
the last dollar I am worth . Be the effect, therefore, what 
it may upon my property, your time and ingenuity might 
have been better spent than in justifying the steps you 
ha$ taken to accommodate Mr. Harte upon my recom 
mendation. 

I will only add, I shall take my chance of whatever in 
demnity you can procure for me, by an attachment of any 
property within your reach. That Harte still is the son 
of the man I expected, I have a letter from his father 
acknowledging, but declaratory of his having fully dis- 



DESPONDENT. Ill 

carded him, long ago, and affording me no prospect of 
retribution. 

I should hope the pleasing intelligence I have fre 
quently had of Mr. John Clay's present good circum 
stances, may permit me to anticipate he will settle with 
me for the sale he made of a negro woman of mine, in 
Kentucky, through you. 

The hints you have given of the predilection you en 
tertain for your last chosen meridian, have kindled in 
our minds a fire of enthusiastic curiosity, which our pres 
ent embarrassments will constantly fan, until your details 
shall extinguish it with a faithful muster of the fogs and 
musquitoes of the Mississippi. 

But in sober sadness, I wish to learn with what capital, 
or in what speculation or profession, I could enjoy your 
neighborhood, when I can bid adieu to the spot on 
which I have so long hoped I should rest my bones for 
ever. I am inclined to hope my highly-valued friend, 
Woodbridge,* would accompany me, if he could see any 
mercantile prospects more inviting than this country 
affords. I have no doubt your friendship will find a mo 
ment of repose in your present cares of fame and fortune, 
in which I highly rejoice, to gratify mv expectation in 
this respect. 

Since I find you give us such just credit for the senti 
ments with which Mrs. Brown and yourself have inspired 
us, I will offer no repetition of them only a more possi 
ble prospect of personally testifying them, you may be 
sure, makes them more vivid, even in the abandonment

of books and science, to which, I fear, the state of my 
affairs will henceforth, I know not how long, condemn me. 
Farewell ! dear Brown, and believe me always to be 
Your attached friend, 

H. BLENNERHASSETT. 

On the 15th of December, 1805, he dispatched the fol 
lowing letter to General Devereux : * 

MY DEAR DEVEREUX: 

Sensible for your kind concern for us, I use the first 
opportunity since our return home to acquaint you, that 
we effected our journey with safety, and had the blessing 
to find our dear boy recovered, so that nothing threatens 
henceforward to interfere with our enjoyment of your 
company when we can obtain it, but unavoidable atten 
tion to some embarrassments my circumstances have 
lately undergone ; the effect of which more and more dis 
poses me to endeavor to change my situation, by selling 
or letting this place to effect a removal to another, where 
I could embark in mercantile pursuits, or the resumption 
of my old profession. 

Now, not wishing to advertise the place, I know no 

* General Devereux was a descendant of one of the most ancient and 
noted families of Ireland. One of his ancestry drew his sword upon 
Queen Elizabeth, when she slapped him in the face for his impertinence, 
and insisted that if she were a man he would dispatch her for the indig 
nity. He finally became reconciled, but was subsequently beheaded for 
treason. The General was one of the leaders of the United Irishmen in 
the Rebellion of '96 and 1803, and subsequently made his escape to the 
United States. He afterward joined Bolivar in the Columbian Revolution, 
where he greatly distinguished himself by his bravery and military skill. 
On the emancipation of the South American Republics, he was made Min 
ister to Russia, and, I believe, afterward to the United States. 



FOR SALE. 113 

better means of disposing of it than through the industry 
of your friendship. I, therefore, request your attention 
to my views, and the following description of my situa 
tion, to enahle you to procure such a purchaser or tenant 
as would suit me, and effect our common happiness by a 
residence in the same place. Respecting the farm, which, 
through want of skill and capital, I am unable to make 
the best advantage of, you may, with the utmost truth 
and honor, represent it as containing about two hundred 
acres of the richest land in the world, which, rented out 
to the poorest of tenants, can, at any time, command a 
rent of five dollars per acre, payable in corn at the market 
price in this country ; but would prove more lucrative in 
the hands of a capitalist, with forty or fifty negroes, who 
would engage in raising hemp or tobacco. These pro 
ducts better afford a rent of twenty-five hundred dollars 
a year than one thousand in the other way. Such a rent 
I should expect of such a tenant as I could let the whole to, 
namely, a gentleman of fortune, disposed to reside in this 
country, who would find an elegant seat with (a desirable) 
convenient improvements ; no want of which would dis 
turb his care or withdraw his attention for the ease and 
profit with which he might reside here, whence he might 
send his tobacco, cordage, cotton or flour, to i^ew Orleans, 
at the rate of one dollar and a quarter per barrel, where 
the market will always afford him a medium price, twelve 
or fifteen per cent, higher than the farmer dependent on 
the Atlantic towns can have, without taking into consid 
eration the excess of western produce. 

If a purchase should be preferred, I could not in justice 
to my family sell at less than twenty-five years' credit, on 



114 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the above twenty-five hundred dollars, which would be 
then sinking a serious part of the money I have expended 
on this place, which may be easily conceived when it is 
understood the house and offices I occupy, stand me in 
upward of thirty thousand dollars, not to mention gardens 
and shrubbery, in the English style hedges, post-fences, 
and complete farm-yards, containing barns, stables, over 
seers' and negroes' houses, etc., etc. ; though, for the sake 
of removing from a place which does not now so well 
suit myself, I would sacrifice somewhat of the money I 
have expended. 

Any one disposed to treat for the place will be apprised 
beforehand, by all who have seen it, from the most unob- 
serving passenger, to Mr. Harris, of its good order, 
richness and elegant situation, opposite the handsome 
settlement of Belpre*, fourteen miles below Marietta, and 
within view of Wood Court-House in Virginia, in the 
midst of a country, where the lumber and provision trade, 
with ship-building, has commenced, and will be established 
above and below it, from Pittsburgh to the falls of the 
Ohio. 

I would only direct a purchaser's attention to this 
sketch, which he can easily verify, and the rent required 
for such an establishment can not be considered high, 
when compared with what is so unaccountably obtained 
for a single house in Baltimore. If the style and extent 
of the house should be demanded, it may be stated as 
highly and completely finished, containing, with the 
wings connected to it by circular corridors, thirty-six 
windows, glazed with lights 12 by 18 inches. 

You will not forget to have General Macon, who lives 



RESPONSIBILITIES. 115 

on an island near Georgetown, and I hear, like myself, 
prefers an insular situation, informed how commodiously 
he might accommodate his family, if I have truly heard, 
he desires to move to the western country, in which case 
I could take landed property of his below, at a valuation, 
in exchange, if he would give me my price. 

II. BLENNERHASSETT. 

Among other letters which he mentions as having ac 
cumulated during his absence at the East, was his first 
communication from Colonel Burr, regretting that the 
absence of Blennerhassett from home had deprived him 
of the pleasure of improving his personal acquaintance, 
when visiting his island residence. In an insinuating but- 
guarded manner, he alluded to the talents of Blenner 
hassett, as deserving of a higher sphere than that in 
which they were employed. He was surrounded, to be 
sure, with all the comforts of life, but those very comforts 
only served to effeminate the mind, for want of active 
engagements. His pleasures were merely passive, and 
were better suited to the negative enjoyment of the rude 
and unconscious herd, than to those delightful sensations 
experienced by the intelligent mind when in the active 
exercise of all its ennobling powers. There were other 
considerations, too, which should induce him to feel that 
physical effort was necessary. He was surrounded by a 
growing family, who demanded of him superior advan 
tages over those to be obtained in his new and unpolished 
neighborhood. His fortune was gradually diminishing, 
while no effort was made to add to his present estate.

erishment of his children by his listless attention to all 
financial affairs. Suggesting several plans by which 
Blennerhassett might enhance his fortune, and render 
himself a more important individual in society, he left 
him to meditate on the truthfulness of the picture so 
dexterously set before him. 

Such apparently disinterested counsel, from one whose 
judgment and experience he respected, caused Blenner 
hassett to turn his attention, more particularly than he 
had hitherto done, toward himself and his own affairs. 
The result was all that Burr could have desired. It 
called forth the suggestions with reference to his removal, 
in his letter to Brown, and gave rise to the following cor 
respondence : 

December 21st, 1805. 
AARON BURR, ESQ., 

SIR : The receipt of your letter, by post, has been de 
layed until my return home from Baltimore. While it 
enables me to return my acknowledgments for the honor 
of your kind remembrance, it affords the opportunity of 
expressing my extreme regret that we were absent at the 
time of your intended visit. This disappointment can 
not be removed but by another of like condescension, 
which may, in some measure, compensate us for the past. 

The mention, sir, you have made of the attention you 
were pleased to give to young Mr. Harte, on my recom 
mendation, would alone make it my duty to apologize for 
having obtruded upon your notice a man whose acts, as I 
have heard since he left this, have qualified him for no 
better situation than that of a jail. But my belief that 
he was really the son of the gentleman in Europe I took

him for, which turns out to be correct, though he is dis 
carded by his father, and the confidence and credit ob 
tained from me, through a letter from his father, which I 
supposed authentic, by which I have lost four thousand 
dollars : these circumstances, sir, your liberality will 
regard as some ground of excuse for the liberty I had 
taken with you. I am now about to venture another, on 
my own account, to which I presume to request an 
answer at your first convenient leisure. 

Estimating the value of your reflections on the view 
you have taken of the western country, and particularly 
of Louisiana, I have thought it of great importance to 
obtain your sentiments to confirm or correct the irresist 
ible attraction my friend, Mr. James Brown, assures me I 
should follow, to settle in his vicinity, if I would but 
visit that country. His words are, my " removal would 
be inevitable " an expression, truly, strong enough, when 
viewed through my regard for his friendship, and my 
confidence in his judgment, to endanger my repose on 
this island, where for eight years I have dreamed and 
hoped I should rest my bones forever. 

But the interests of a growing family, I feel, will sum 
mon me again into active life, to the resumption of my 
former profession of the bar, mercantile or other enter 
prise, if I should find an opportunity of selling or letting 
my establishment here to a gentleman who could, with 
out a sacrifice, give me a price by which I should not lose 
too much of the money it stands me in, say $50,000 ; or 
afford me a rent of $2,500, which, by proper manage 
ment, it might be made to realize without paying, at the 
highest rate, half the yearly value of the extensive and

numerous conveniences on the place, with a detail of 
which I forbear to trouble you, observing, merely, that 
there is now in good order, say two hundred acres, which, 
with twenty well-managed hands, employed in raising 
hemp, would afford a handsome profit. In either way, 
if I could sell or leave the place, I would move forward 
with a firmer confidence in any undertaking which your 
sagacity might open to profit and fame. 

Having thus advised you of my desire and motives to 
pursue a change of life, to engage in any thing which 
may suit my circumstances, I hope, sir, you will not 
regard it indelicate in me to observe to you how highly I 
should be honored in being associated with you, in any 
contemplated enterprise you would permit me to partici 
pate in. The amount of means I could at first come 
forward with would be small. You might command my 
services as a lawyer, or in any other way you should sug 
gest as being most useful. I could, I have no doubt, unite 
the talents and energy of two of my particular friends, 
who would share in any fortune which might follow 
you. The gentlemen alluded to are Mr. Dudley Wood- 
bridge, junior, of Marietta, and Mr. Devereux, of Balti 
more, a ci de-vant general in the Irish rebel army.* 

Not presuming to know or guess at th e intercourse, if 
any, subsisting between you and the present Government, 
but viewing the probability of a rupture with Spain, the 
claim for action the country will make upon your talents, 
in the event of an engagement against, or subjugation 
of, any of the Spanish Territories, I am disposed in the

confidential spirit of this letter to offer you my friends, 
and my own services to co-operate in any contemplated 
measures in which you may embark. 

In making this proposition, I hope, Mr, you will feel 
that it flows in a conviction of your judgment and talents, 
from a quarter that ever did and always will prefer to 
seek fortune and fame through the call, rather than the 
coercion, of any government. 

A further development of iny views would at present 
aggravate the trespass on your time hy this letter, too 
much prolonged, and would besides, I hope, be a guaran 
tee of the perfect confidence you may repose in my 
integrity in any communication you may be pleased to 
honor me with. 

I shall await with much anxiety the receipt of your 
reply, and with warm interest in your success and pros 
perity, 

I remain, dear sir, your obliged and obedient servant, 

H. BLENNERHASSETT. 



Burr to Blennerhassett. 

WASHINGTON CITY, April 15A, 1806. 
DEAR SIR : Your very interesting letter of the 21st of 
December, arrived here just after I had passed through 
this city on my way to South Carolina, and was not 
received until about two months after its date : the sub 
ject of it has since that time been daily in my mind. 
Independently of considerations personal to myself, I 
learn with the utmost pleasure that you are to be restored 
to the social and the active world. Your talents and 



120 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

acquirements seem to have destined you for something 
more than vegetable life, and since the first hour of our 
acquaintance, I have considered your seclusion as a fraud 
on society. 

The confidence you have been pleased to place in me is 
extremely flattering, and it would seem that there has 
been, without explanation, a sort of consent between our 
minds. In a matter of so much moment, and on which I 
am so imperfectly informed, it would be hazarding too 
much to offer advice ; yet it is due to the frankness of 
your letter, to acknowledge that I had projected, and still 
meditate, a speculation, precisely of the character you 
have described. It would have been submitted to your 
consideration in October last, if I had then the good for 
tune to find you at home. The business, however, 
depends, in some degree, on contingencies, not within 
my control, and will not be commenced before December 
or January, if ever. From this circumstance, and as the 
matter, in its present state, can not be satisfactorily ex 
plained by letter, the communication will be deferred 
until a personal interview can be had. With this view I 
pray to be informed of your intended movements the 
ensuing season, and in case you should visit Orleans, at 
what time, and at what port you may be expected on the 
Atlantic coast. But I must insist that these intimations 
be not permitted to interrupt the prosecution of any 
plans which you have formed for yourself no occupation 
which shall not take you off the continent can interfere 
with that which I may propose. You would certainly 
be pleased, probably charmed, with the manners and the 
society of Orleans. As a place of business, too, it offers

great advantages ; most of those who style themselves 
lawyers, are become visionary speculators, or political 
fanatics. Mr. Brown, by avoiding these follies, has in 
spired confidence, and is growing rich. The country is 
deficient in the means of education, and the climate is 
thought, I believe with reason, unfriendly to children. 

"We shall have no war unless we should be actually in 
vaded. Some estimate of the views and temper of our 
Government may be formed from the proceedings of the 
House of Representatives, with closed doors. A copy of 
that part of their journal is sent for your amusement. 

Accept, dear sir, assurances of the great consideration 
and respect with which I am, 

Yours obediently, A. BURR.

BALTIMORE, May 17A, 1806. 

DEAR SIR : About the 15th of April, I wrote you from 
"Washington, in answer to your letter of December, 
apol&gizing, at the same time, for the lapse of so great 
a period between the date of your letter and that 
of my reply. For God's sake, therefore, do n't retaliate 
on me in this particular. My movements for the sum 
mer, as far as can now be ascertained, will be to return to 
Philadelphia to-morrow, to pass one month (something 
less) in that vicinity ; thence to Bedford, in the mount

taking excursions to Pittsburgh, Union Town, etc. The

Your friend and obedient servant, 

A. BURR. 

Address me at "Washington city. If the " city " be

PHILADELPHIA, July 24th, 1806. 

DEAR SIR : Owing to an absence of unexpected dura 
tion from this city, your letter of the 23d of May was not 
received until a few days ago. My daughter has gone 
on to Bedford. My engagements in this city not permit

be at your house before the 20th of August. Let me

I omit, till a personal interview, a further answer to 
your obliging letter. 

Two young gentlemen of respectable connections and 
character, are on their way down the river, Mr. S. 
Swartwout,* of New York, and Mr. S. Ogden, of New 
Jersey. I have desired that they would stop at your

inquiries you might please to make about Cis-Montane 
men or things. I pray that they may experience your 
wonted courtesy 

Very respectfully, your friend and faithful servant,

Burr to Blennerhassett. 

BEDFORD, August 15A, 1806. 

You perceive, my dear sir, that I have made a little 
progress. I shall leave this to-morrow, but a detention 
of two or three days at Pittsburgh will not allow me the 
hope of seeing you at Belpr6 before the 23d or 24th. 

I leave here my daughter and her son, who have both 
greatly profited by the use of the waters, or, what is per 
haps more probable, by the mountain air. She desired 
much to accompany me to your house, but we have com 
promised by my consenting that she shall meet me at 
Belpre on the 1st of October. 

With great respect, yours, A. BURR.

124 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Some time in the month of August, 1806, Col. Burr, 
in company with Col. De Pestre* and Dudley Wood- 
ridge, Junior, arrived at the island. At this time, as we 
are informed, Burr, with considerable reserve, partially 
revealed the objects and plan of the contemplated enter 
prise. From information received from reliable sources, 
he was induced to believe that the sentiments of a re 
spectable majofity of the people of Orleans and Missis 
sippi Territories were disaffected to the Government; 
that such was the dissatisfaction of the people, unless 
early measures were adopted to prevent it, they would 
fling themselves into the arms of any foreign power 
which should pledge itself to protect them. In such an 
event, the Western States would be placed in a dilemma, 
out of which they could only escape by an eastern or 
western ascendancy of interests ; that after an examina 
tion of the subject, so clearly satisfied would they become 
that their connection with the Atlantic States was inimi 
cal to western interests, they would no longer consent to 
the alliance, but would sever themselves from the Union. 
So far as he was personally concerned, he had no further 
interest in the event than of a speculative character. The 
people, however, should be advised, lest they should be 
unexpectedly involved in a crisis for which they were 
unprepared. 

The separation of the Western from the Atlantic 
States, he assured them, was no new project. It was a 
subject of daily discussion at the seat of Government, 

* Burr's confidential agent or minister, who had been sent on a mission 
to Europe, and was then in negotiation with the representative of the 
Spanish Court. 



CONSULTATION. 125 

and by some of the heads of department; that it 
was seriously apprehended the mal-administration of 
the Government might precipitate the event much sooner 
than it was desired or expected. So thoroughly disgusted 
were the people of ~New Orleans with the conduct of the 
administration, both with reference to themselves, and as 
to Spanish American affairs, that he expected to hear of 
their beginning a revolt by seizing on the bank and cus 
tom-house and appropriating to themselves the revenues 
and forces of the Territory. Even then, he declared, 
there was a society of young men in New Orleans, 
denominated " The Mexican Society," who had seized 
and shipped a number of cannons belonging to the 
French, for a Mexican invasion, and that while there, 
but a short time previous, he himself had been solicited 
to become their leader. 

With the questions of a war with Spain, and the 
separation of the Western from the Atlantic States, 
Burr declared he had no concern; but, in any event, 
neither would interrupt his enterprise ; nor would they 
be adverse to his own views, let them precede or follow 
his own undertaking. 

He assured Blennerhassett that he was advised as to 
the views of the Administration ; that the expulsion of 
the Spaniards from the American Territory then vio 
lated by them, or even an invasion of Mexico, would be 
pleasing to Mr. Jefferson, if either could be effected with 
out a declaration of war against Spain, which was now 
prevented by parsimony on the one hand, and dread of 
France on the other. 

As this interview and its results, somewhat figura- 



126 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

lively drawn by Mr. Wirt, on the trial at Richmond, 
have invested the name of Blennerhassett with greater 
interest than, perhaps, it would have otherwise attained, 
it is here inserted: 

" A shrubbery, which Shenstone might have envied, 
blooms around him ; music that might have charmed 
Calypso and her nymphs, is his; an extensive library 
spreads its treasures before him ; a philosophical appara 
tus offers to him all the mysteries and secrets of nature ; 
peace, tranquillity and innocence shed their mingled de 
lights around him ; and, to crown the enchantment of 
the scene, a wife who is said to be lovely, even beyond 
her sex, and graced with every accomplishment that can 
render it irresistible, has blessed him with her love, and 
made him the father of her children. The evidence would 
convince you, that this is only a faint picture of real life. 
In the midst of all this peace, this innocence, this tran 
quillity, this feast of mind, this pure banquet of the 
heart, the destroyer comes : he comes to turn his paradise 
into a hell ; yet the flowers do not wither at his approach, 
and no monitory shuddering, through the bosom of their 
unfortunate possessor, warns him of the ruin that is com 
ing upon him. A stranger presents himself. Introduced 
to their civilities by the high rank he had lately held in 
his country, he soon finds way to their hearts by the dig 
nity and elegance of his demeanor, the light and beauty 
of his conversation, and the seductive and fascinating 
power of his address. The conquest was not a difficult 
one. Innocence is ever simple and credulous ; conscious 
of no designs itself, it expects none in others ; every door 
and portal of the heart are thrown open, and all who 



RECRUITING. 127 

choose it, enter. Such was the state of Eden when the 
serpent entered its Dowers. The prisoner" (Burr), "in a 
more engaging form, winding himself into the open and 
unpractised heart of Blennerhassett, found but little diffi 
culty in changing the native character of that heart, and 
the objects of its affections. By degrees, he infuses into 
it the poison of his own ambition ; he breathes into it 
the fire of his own courage ; a daring and desperate thirst 
for glory ; an ardor panting for all the storms and bustle 
and hurricane of life. In a short time, the whole man is 
changed ; and every object of his former delights relin 
quished. No more he enjoys the tranquil scene ; it has 
become flat and insipid to his taste. His books are aban 
doned ; his retort and crucible thrown aside ; his shrub 
bery blooms and breathes its fragrance upon the air 'in 
vain, he likes it not ; his ear no longer drinks the melody 
of music, it longs for the trumpet's clangor and the can 
non's roar. Even the prattle of his babes, once so sweet, 
no longer affects him, and the angel-smile of his wife, 
who hitherto touched his bosom with ecstasy so unspeak 
able, is now unfelt for and unseen. Greater objects have 
taken possession of his soul ; his imagination has been 
dazzled by visions of diadems, and stars, and garters, and 
titles of nobility ; he has been taught to burn, with rest 
less emulation, at the names of Cromwell, Caesar, and 
Bonaparte," etc. 

Leaving his daughter with Mrs. Blennerhassett, Burr 
proceeded immediately to recruiting men for the expe 
dition. His mind w r as now fully determined on the en 
terprise. Every thing appeared favorable ; and what was 
to prevent the realization of his dreams? 



128 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

"Far away to the south-west, a thousand miles beyond 
the Mississippi, lay a vast and wealthy empire, governed 
by tyrants whom the people hated, and defended by 
troops whom soldiers should despise. For years, the 
riches of that kingdom were the theme of travelers. Her 
mines were inexhaustible, and had flooded Europe with 
gold. Her nobles enjoyed the revenues of emperors ; her 
capitol was said to be blazoned with jewels. It was 
known to look down on the lake, into whose waters the 
unhappy Guatemozin had cast the treasures of that long 
line of native princes, of which he was the last. Men 
dreamed of that magnificent city as Aladdin dreamed of 
his palaces, or Columbus of Cathay. Costly statues; 
vessels of gold and silver; jewels of untold value ; troops 
of the fairest Indian girls for slaves ; all that the eye de 
lighted in, or the heart of man could desire, it was cur 
rently declared, would form the plunder of Mexico. A 
bold adventurer, commanding an army of Anglo-Saxon 
soldiers, could possess himself of the empire. The times 
were favorable to the enterprise. The priesthood through 
out Mexico was disaffected, and would gladly lend its aid 
to any conqueror who secured its privileges ; and the 
priesthood then, as now, exercised a paramount influence 
over the weak and superstitious Mexicans. America, too, 
was thought to be on the eve of a Spanish war, when the 
contemplated expedition might easily be fitted out at 
New Orleans. Burr saw, the glittering prize, and resolved 
to seize it. He would conquer this gorgeous realm, and 
realize, in this new world, as Napoleon did in the old, a 
dream of romance. 

" He would surround his throne with dukes and mar- 



ENTHUSIASM. 129 

shals, and princes of the empire. The pomp of chivalry, 
the splendors of the East, should be revived in this court. 
Realms equally rich, and even more easy of spoil, opened 
to the South, to whose conquest his successors, if not 
himself, might aspire. Perhaps nothing 1 would check his 
victorious banner until he had traversed the contiirent, 
and stood on that bold and stormy promontory, where 
the contending waters of the Atlantic and Pacific lash 
around Cape Horn." 

With that eloquence of expression and power of im 
agination which were peculiarly his, he infused into the 
minds of his auditors a thirst, like his own, for the bril 
liant scenes of Mexico. At Marietta he had an opportu 
nity of meeting with the militia, who were assembled for 
the purpose of an annual training. Being called upon 
for that purpose, he exercised the regiment .in a few evo 
lutions, by which he demonstrated to the doubting his 
superior knowledge of military tactics, and capability for 
commanding. A ball succeeded the training, in the even 
ing. The congregated beauty of the surrounding neigh 
borhood greeted him. with their smiles ; while the men 
of rougher mould gave encouragement to his enterprise. 
Offers of distinction and rank, and the dazzling dreams 
of wealth, were arguments irresistible to the young and 
adventurous ; and Burr soon found himself surrounded 
by men impatient for the expedition. 

Let it not be presumed that the honest and patriotic 
spirits of the West for a moment contemplated treachery 
to their country, or meditated a willful violation of her 
laws. They who 1 had breasted the storms of adversity, 

in every conceivable shape ; who had scaled the barriers

of the Alleghanies, amid the dangers of Indian warfare ; 
who, for many years, had stood upon the frontier of civ 
ilization, and grappled, in deadly conflict, with the ene 
mies of their country and their race; who had pursued 
the savage to his wigwam and startled him from his 
mountain fastness ; these were men whom impartial his 
tory must pronounce incapable of a crime so base, so 
revolting to the mind of every patriot. But they were 
deceived, in their over-credulousness, in the statement of 
Burr, and joined the expedition, under the well-grounded 
belief that Jefferson favored it ; and that, in the event of 
war, it would be neither illegal nor contrary to the wishes 
of the government. 



WRITING IT UP. 131 



CHAPTER VII. 

IN the month of September, 1806, Burr commenced 
active preparations for the contemplated expedition. 
Contracts for fifteen large bateaux, sufficient to con 
vey five hundred men, and a large keel-boat for the 
transportation of provision, arms, ammunition, etc., 
also for flour, whisky, corn-meal, and other eatables, 
were entered into ; for the most of which Blenner- 
hassett became responsible. Much of the corn, from 
which the meal was made, was raised and kiln-dried 
on the island. 

While these operations were being carried forward, 
Burr visited Chillicothe, then the seat of government 
of Ohio, and continued his trip to Cincinnati, and 
thence to Kentucky. The object of this tour was to 
extend his acquaintance, and add new recruits to his 
enterprise. Each private was to supply himself with 
proper arms and clothing, and to receive, as a com 
pensation for his services, one hundred acres of land 
on the "Washita; while officers were to receive accord 
ing to their grade. 

Soon after his departure, Blennerhassett prepared a 
series of essays which appeared in the Ohio Gazette, a 
newspaper published at Marietta, by Fairlamb, under 
the signature of Querist. These exhibited a general 



132 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and relative view, in a political aspect, of the Union and 
the western country ; presenting motives of expediency 
which should induce a separation from the Atlantic 
States in a peaceable and constitutional manner. He 
designed to prepare the minds of his fellow-citizens for a 
crisis which he believed was sooner or later approaching, 
not from the motives of Burr, but from the state of 
affairs then existing on the Mississippi, at which an es 
pousal of eastern or western ascendancy would determ 
ine their future prosperity. A second, and perhaps 
paramount, object was to divert public attention from 
too close a scrutiny of the plans against Spain, which, if 
successfully concealed, might be tacitly approved by the 
Government, and suffered to proceed without serious in 
tervention. I insert but one of these communications, 
as the whole are too voluminous for the design of this 
work : 

September, 1806. 

To THE EDITOR OP THE OHIO GAZETTE : 

SIR: Of all the causes that produced our colonial 
war, which terminated in the establishment of our inde 
pendence, it has appeared to me that the most operative, 
if it has ever been fully appreciated by our politicians, 
has been least insisted upon. Our complaints and our 
struggles against the mother country, however they have 
attempted to be bastardized by the blunders of the igno 
rant or the craft of the designing, had really a commercial 
and no other parentage. The unbiassed judgment of 
posterity will no doubt decide that the good people of the 
colonies, however justly entitled to all the rights they 
have vindicated, were, nevertheless, in establishing them, 



ESSAYING. 133 

from the beginning to the end, the unconscious instru 
ments of a small party or interest among themselves ; 
namely, the commercial. To prove this truth, the im 
parted history of our own times will adduce ample evi 
dence, without need of citing our early petitions and 
remonstrances to Britain, which alone would place it 
beyond all doubt. 

That the colonies then, in effect, took upon them the 
burden of the war for the advantage of merchants, though 
the issue of it has produced the greatest benefit to us all, 
is so far our concern at this day as to induce us to ex 
amine the influence of the present commercial interest in 
the United States at large, and the western country in 
particular. And this becomes the more necessary, as the 
present party in power are said, by their adherents, to be 
political economists of the school of Monsieur Quesnai, 
desirous to promote the agricultural at the expense of the 
commercial interest ; while their predecessors in office, as 
rigid followers of Mr. Colbert, would advance on an en 
tirely opposite system. But neither the one nor the other 
will promote the resources of any country without great 
modification. 

If the opinion I have formed be well founded, that the 
war we have happily concluded by our independence was 
produced by the interests of the mercantile system on the 
Atlantic, I have been led, also, to suspect that the polit 
ical federation of the State comprises within it, in lik-e- 
nianner, the spirit of a commercial confederacy ; the 
effects of whyjh, I trust, 'our penetration and conduct will 
succeed to direct to further beneficial consequences to our 
country than are contemplated or regarded oy its members. 



134 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

In examining the commercial history of all nations, I 
have nowhere found a parallel to such a degree of trade 
carried on in any other country as that of our own, with 
the protection of so small a navy, and the assistance of so 
much foreign capital. The extent of our navy is known 
to every one. But it is not, probably, generally under 
stood, that two-thirds of the capital made use of is not 
our own, but that of foreigners and belligerents some of 
it embarked in our home and foreign trade ; the rest in 
our carrying trade. What influence from this source 
may flow into the country it much concerns us to weigh 
and watch. But I have observed some resemblance in 
the general character of our Atlantic commerce, and the 
Teutonic confederacy, founded in Germany about the 
middle of the thirteenth century. There was created a 
commercial confederacy of cities, distant from each other 
in local situation and Interests. The Hanseatic towns 
associated for trade, not only all the maritime cities of 
Germany, but even comprehended some of France and 
England the whole directing the partial views and inter 
ests of individual members to the profit of the company. 
The Atlantic confederation has conciliated the different 
interests of the North and South, with the general profit 
of the whole. The Teutonic confederacy was carried on 
without interfering with the various sovereigns on whom 
they depended. The Atlantic confederacy has hitherto 
progressed with a successful accommodation of the vari 
ous sovereignties and local interests of the respective 
States. The German confederacy became objects of the 
jealousy, and victims of the hatred of other nations, by 
the arrogance arising out of their prosperity in appropri- 



VATICINATIONS. 135 

ating to themselves the trade of the world which they 
had engrossed. The Atlantic confederacy may reach a 
similar prosperity, hut will expire hy a like fate. 

From this hasty sketch of the state and principles of 
our Atlantic commerce, we are naturally led to ask, " in 
what manner these cis-Allegheny countries can control or 
be effected by its interests ? " As to the latter member 
of this query, I have already said enough to show how 
diligently we should guard against the insinuation of 
its influence among us, and shall reserve myself on that 
topic for such further animadversion as may hereafter 
be due to the contingent remarks of others. But as to 
the former, our means or our motives to injure the com 
mercial pursuits of our brothers on the Atlantic, will 
now engage my attention. 

"When I hear suggestions made of the danger of* our 
rivaling the Atlantic States in their trade, I really sus 
pect some motives for uttering them worse than igno 
rance. That the whole western country must, at least 
for a lapse of ages, content itself under the injunctions 
of nature, with the condition of an agricultural and manu 
facturing country, is a proposition too evident to be 
seriously questioned by any one. In the present state of 
information, it is equally known to the fishermen of 
Nantucket, and the rice-planter of Georgia, that it will 
forever remain impracticable for our shipping to perform 
a return voyage against the currents of our long rivers ; * 
that the port of New Orleans, our only outlet, must 
always, from its situation, be indefensible against a single

frigate, and that from our distance from the sea, and 
many temporary obstacles added to those that are already 
stated to be perpetual and insurmountable by ourselves, 
the United States, or some other commercial power, must 
ever be the carriers of our surplus produce from New 
Orleans. 

It was no serious alarm, therefore, of our being ever 
able to entertain the project of appropriating generally to 
ourselves, either a part of their foreign or of their carry 
ing trade that has hitherto engendered in the Atlantic 
merchant a desire to foster a scheme of jealous and narrow 
policy, which they have succeeded in infusing into all our 
cabinets and councils against the advancement of our 
western interests since the Revolution, which, from the 
period of the reservation of the Salt springs, to the last 
moderate increase of the price, in what are called Con 
gressional lands, our trusty representatives have so tem 
porarily forborne to expose to their constituents. The 
real object was, the monopoly of the West India market. 
But that market they must share, and indeed abandon to 
us, however our political situation may vary. It should 
not, however, be inferred, that the use we can make of 
it, for a great many years to come, can materially injure 
the commercial interest of the Atlantic States. How 
paltry, then, has been the little jealousy of us, conceived 
upon this ground ! How mean and treacherous the conceal 
ment of it from the people ! But how criminal has been 
every system of all our Federal and Republican cabinets, 
as regarding this division of the Union, how masked to 
our citizens, we will now inquire. 

A wilderness that hardly had felt the footsteps of civil- 



PIONEERING. 137 

ized man, is pierced in the midst of a foreign war. Our 
adventurous citizens first encounter all the miseries of the 
forest, and the savage warfare of the Indians, in prospect 
of acquiring a patrimony for their children. Their num 
bers are small, but they maintain their posts, and ever 
march against a foreign foe on their frontier, whilst their 
brethren are encountering him on the sea-board. After 
many vicissitudes of hardship and privation, they are 
joined in the woods by their relatives and friends, who 
only brought with them, out of the Revolutionary war, 
the scars and wounds they received in fighting for their 
country, depending on her gratitude for the recompense 
of their labors. Thus united, all strive in common against 
the savages, and participate in the equal prospect of in 
demnity from the State and from Congress. In a short 
time they discover that those lands which owed all their 
worth to themselves are ceded to the Union. Indian 
titles are set up, and extinguished by some trinkets and 
some spirits, and the real conquerors of the country, 
are either confined to the corn fields they had planted, 
or left to pine unknown in some more distant retreats 
in the wilderness. Such has been the fortune of our 
adventurers into the country generally, for twenty years, 
from Pittsburgh to the Mississippi, particularly in Ken 
tucky. Such has been the retribution of our country to 
her children, who have shed their blood for her honor 
and independence ! 

Notwithstanding all restrictions, however, of impolicy 
and injustice, our country advances in population and 
settlement. Immense numbers of emigrants from the old 
States flock to our woods, and unite with us in forcing 



138 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS 

the face of our wilderness to unbend somewhat of the 
rigors of its savage features to take upon it the cheering 
smiles of agriculture. In ten or twelve years our disin 
terested statesmen on the Atlantic felicitate our delegates 
on the growing prosperity of our country; profess to 
them assurances of the fatherly love and protection of the 
Federal Government ; invite them to return into the 
family of the Union, from which they had eloped by 
their emigration, so soon as they shall be entitled to re- 
admission therein, by some years probation in passing 
through the purgatory of a territorial government, when 
they shall be honored by being permitted to contribute to 
State and Federal revenues, not through the coercion of 
an ordinance of Congress, but by their own representa 
tives ; when, instead of no representative government at 
all, they shall be placed under two, without paying both 
of which, they will be neither able to protect themselves 
against Bonaparte or the grand Mogul, to make laws for 
the restraint of crimes or the security of property in the 
woods. Such or similar topics of comfort and admonition 
have been swallowed by the large ears of our representa 
tives ; such they have echoed to their constituents. The 
people, on their side, illy fitted, by their habits and occu 
pations, for sounding the depths of these speculations, 
have innocently believed their interests, if not duly at 
tended to, were not at least betrayed. But now they be 
gin to inquire what mysterious complication of circum 
stances reduces them to the necessity of supporting two 
governments, with two judiciaries to repress private 
wrongs, and enforce private rights, in a country where 
both are few and simple ; to contribute two revenues to

two executives, some of them non-resident among them, 
and all alive to their own interests ; in short, to pay the 
wages of a double representation, which has hitherto 
neglected or sacrificed the proper objects of its mission. 
When we soberly interrogate ourselves on these subjects 
we readily find a clue that will easily lead us out of the 
mazes of the labyrinth in which we have so long wan 
dered. We shall then behold, in the open field of inves 
tigation, into which I perhaps have first entered, the two 
principal, if not the only, enemies of our rights and inter 
ests ill-founded prejudices of commercial growth and 
origin in the Atlantic States, against the effects of our 
prosperity in the western country, and the neglect of that 
inquiry or information hitherto by our citizens, which 
should enable them properly to appreciate their civil and 
political situation both present and to come. 

How far I may have deserved well of the country in 
reconnoitering the enemy in his trenches, as I promised 
in my last, and have endeavored in this paper, I will not 
presume to judge. At some after period, when the 
warmth of interest, passion and party shall subside, I will 
patiently, and I hope with dignity, abide the judgment 
of my fellow-citizens. In the same spirit I shall, in my 
next paper, consider those objections that have occurred 
to me against the measure of a severance of the Union, 
with the reputations they may require. But I wish it 
understood, that I have no intention of recommending 
either the mode or the time in which it should be effected.

timid or designing among the crew may do well to com 
pose their alarms, or regulate their schemes, "by an implicit 
assurance that through all changes and chances of the 
voyage I shall always be found at my post, wherever pri 
vate honor or public duty may summon me. 

QUERIST. 

Lexington, Kentucky, was then a central point in the 
western Territories of the United States ; then, as now, 
its society was of the most intelligent and refined in 
the Mississippi valley. The best and most ancient and 
honorable families of Virginia and the South had its 
legitimate representatives in her gay assemblies. No one 
accustomed to the elegancies of refined society, either in 
the old or new world, ever visited its hospitable mansions 
without an agreeable surprise at the taste and cultivation 
of its ladies, and the high-toned gallantry of its men. 
No other village of equal population, no other suburban 
settlements, I assert it not disparagingly, could boast a 
longer catalogue of equally illustrious names. In those 
days, to cross the Alleghennies without running over to 
Lexington, would be to visit France without a stroll along 
the Boulevards, or to wander over Italy without look 
ing in upon the Vatican. 

In the month of October, Mrs. Alston, the accom 
plished daughter of Col. Burr, was joined by her husband 
at the Island Mansion. The ostensible object of the 
visit was the re-establishment of her health, and the 
gratification of her father, who desired her company on 



COL. ALSTON. 141 

his wild and solitary rambles. Lexington had been 
designated as the point of rendezvous, and thither they 
repaired, accompanied by Blennerhassett. The manner 
of their reception the marked respect and generous hos 
pitality which was every-where extended, flattered them 
with the hope of the popularity of the movement. Meas 
ures were immediately initiated for a thorough organiza 
tion. It was strongly suspected that meetings for this 
purpose were being secretly held after the manner of 
those inaugurated by Genet. Hence the utmost precau 
tion was necessary to conceal from the public observation 
every thing that might excite their alarm. Among the 
desirable qualities for a successful commander, it is said, 
not the least is the art of conducting a safe retreat, aa 
well as a decisive attack. He should know how to cover 
his retiring files, as well as to order to an advance. To 
quiet the apprehension of the country it was necessary to 
adopt some plausible pretext with which to mask the real 
design, and actually to be embraced in case of a failure. 
Hence it was announced that the object of the movement 
was the colonization of the Bastrop lands. A purchase 
was therefore agreed upon for several thousand acres 
lying on the waters of the Washita, which, with many 
of the uninitiated, was supposed to be their real destina 
tion. 

Col. Alston was a man ot large fortune. He was ex 
tensively engaged in the culture of rice, in the State of 
South Carolina ; but a succession of failures in crops had 
left him destitute of ready means to supply the neces 
sities of Burr. These, upon his personal guaranty, were 
furnished by Blennerhassett, who had to resort to his 



142 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

friends for his own accommodation. The following letter 
throws some light upon the subject, and may settle the 
question which was afterward disputed : 

LEXINGTON, KY., Oct. l&th, 1806. 
MESSRS. Jos. S. LEWIS & Co., PHILA. : 

DEAR SIRS : Having found in this place a most valua 
ble opportunity of participating with some friends of the 
first respectability and resources in the Union, in a com 
mercial and land speculation, the prospect of effecting 
which depends on my obtaining a credit with you, or 
some other friends, for eight or ten thousand dollars, by 
your honoring my drafts at sixty and ninety days, I feel 
no hesitation in resorting to your approved friendship for 
my accommodation. In order to supply the deficit of my 

actual funds, under your management, in the stock, 

I can vouch for your receiving about one thousand pounds 
Irish on my account, in the course of twelve months. 
But I can at any time give security on the vast estates, 
and other property of Joseph Alston, Esq., of South 
Carolina, who is absolutely exempt from all manner of 
incumbrance, and is the son-in-law of Col. Burr. 

In a case of such interest and importance, which, be 
sides in the event of my success, will not be indifferent to 
your mercantile concerns hereafter, I hope I need urge 
no further apology, for the first freedom of this kind I 
have ventured with you. 

I shall therefore expect your answer as soon as I can 
have it by post, directed to me at home ; and, in the 
mean time, I remain as I ever shall, dear sirs. 

Your faithful friend, HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT 



RETROSPECT. 143 

P. S. I can not embark on an aid short of $8,000, but 
$10,000 would improve the concern I look for almost 
doubly. H. B. 

The expedition, in the eyes of many, began now to 
assume a serious aspect ; and, through the medium of the 
press, attracted the attention of those more remote from 
the scene of preparations. Apprehension and alarm 
seized on the public mind, and spread dismay throughout 
the country. Spain had refused us compensation for her 
spoliations during a former war. Our commerce passing 
on the Mobile river continued to be obstructed by arbi 
trary duties and vexatious searches. The boundaries of 
Louisiana remained in dispute, producing much uneasiness 
and discontent in the south-west. The Government had 
been deterred from a declaration of war by Napoleon, 
from the effects of whose arms Europe was then trem 
bling, and who had intimated that France would take 
part with Spain in any contest she might have against 
the United States. Add to these, the impressment of 
American seamen by British vessels, and it will be seen 
our nation was at once reduced to a situation of painful 
humiliation. 

Feeble, indeed, would be that aid which a disunited 
people could render, in time of perils such as these. 
Never before, in the history of the nation, had rebellion 
and disunion so openly avowed itself. How far this dis 
affection extended was, to many, a matter of mysterious 
and anxious conjecture. Burr had, but a few years previ 
ously, closed a close and popular canvass for the executive 
chair. It was known that, not only his partisans, but his 



144 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

personal friends, were numerous ; many of whom were 
men of wealth and influence, who could rally to their 
standard a formidable number to support the cause of 
faction. Party malevolence and personal animosity added 
fuel to the flame, and ultimate ruin hung, as a withering 
pall, over the destinies of the country. 

A rumor was gaining ground that a numerous and 
powerful association, extending from New York, through 
the Western States, to the Gulf of Mexico, had been 
formed ; that eight or ten thousand men were to rendez 
vous in New Orleans, at no distant period ; and from 
thence, with the co-operation of a naval force, follow 
Burr to Yera Cruz ; that agents from Mexico had come 
to Philadelphia during the s,ummer, and had given assur 
ances that the landing of the expedition would be fol 
lowed by such an immediate and general insurrection as 
would insure the submission of the existing Government, 
and silence all opposition in a very few weeks ; that 
a part of the association would descend the Alleghenny 
river, and the first general rendezvous would be at the 
rapids of the Ohio, toward the 20th of October, and from 
thence the aggregate force was to proceed in light-boats, 
with the utmost velocity, to New Orleans, under an 
expectation of being joined on the route by men raised 
in the State of Tennessee and other quarters. 

It was said that the maritime co-operation relied on 
was from a British squadron in the West Indies ; that 
active and influential characters had been engaged in 
making preparations for six or eight months past, which 
were in such a state of readiness that it was expected the 
van would reach New Orleans in December, where the 



ON THE LOOK-OUT. 145 

necessary organization and equipment would be com 
pleted with such promptitude that the expedition would 
leave the Mississippi toward the first of February. It 
was added, that the revolt of the slaves, along the river, 
was relied on, as an auxiliary measure ; and that the 
seizure of the banks of New Orleans was contemplated 
to supply the funds necessary to carry on the enterprise.* 

Mr. Jefferson, then President of the United States, 
through considerations of caution, and to quell the appre 
hension of danger, adopted the precautionary measure of 
appointing Graham, the Secretary of the Territory of 
Orleans, a secret agent of the Government, with instruc 
tions to spy out and investigate any plot hostile to the 
national interest ; empowering him to enter into confer 
ences with the civil and military authorities in the West, 
and, with their aid, to call on the spot whatever should 
become necessary to discover the designs of the supposed 
conspirators ; and also to bring the offenders to punish 
ment, when he should have fully ascertained their in 
tentions. 

It being known, at this time, that many boats were in 
preparation, stores and provisions collected, and an un 
usual number of suspicious characters in motion, on the 
Ohio and its tributaries, orders were given to the Gov 
ernor of the Mississippi and Orleans Territories, and to 
the commanders of the land and naval forces, to be on 
their guard against surprise, and in constant readiness to 
resist any enterprise that might be attempted. 

On the 8th of November, instructions had been sent to 



* Martin's History of Louisiana.

146 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

General Wilkinson, to hasten on accommodations with 
the Spanish commander on the Sabine, and fall back with 
his principal force on the hither bank of the Mississippi.* 
This order, however, had been anticipated by Wilkinson, 
who, on the 5th of the same month, three days previous 
to the dispatch of the instructions, having received intel 
ligence that the Spanish camp on the Sabine would be 
broken up on that day, began his march toward Natchi- 
toches. Immediately on his arrival there, he had directed 
Porter to proceed with the utmost expedition,' and to 
repair, mount, and equip for service, every piece of ord 
nance in the city ; to employ all hands in preparing 
shells, grape, canister and musket cartridges, with buck 
shot ; to have every fieldpiece ready, with horse, harness 
and drag-rope, and to mount six or eight battering can-* 
nons on fort St. Charles and fort St. Louis, below and 
above the city, and along its front, flanks and rear. 

Porter left Natchitoches with all the artificers, and com 
pany of one hundred men, and had been followed by 
Gushing with the rest of the forces, leaving only one 
company behind. Wilkinson, on his way to New Gr- 
leans, stopped at Natchez, and made application to the 
Executive of the Mississippi Territory for a detachment 
of five hundred men of its militia to proceed with him ; 
but, declining to communicate his motives in making the 
requisition, the Governor refused a compliance with so 
mysterious a demand, 

From this place, Wilkinson, on the fifteenth of Novem 
ber, dispatched Burling, one of his aids, to Mexico, for 



* Jefferson's Message of 22d of January, 1807. 



RUMORS CONFIRMED. 147 

the ostensible purpose of apprising the Viceroy of the 
danger with which his sovereign's dominions were men 
aced ; hut, in reality, as the general mentions in his mem 
oirs, on grounds of public policy and professional enter 
prise, to attempt to penetrate the veil which concealed 
the topographical route to the city of Mexico, and the 
military defenses which intervened feeling that the 
equivocal relation of the two countries justified the ruse.* 

As soon as Wilkinson arrived in '!New Orleans, he held 
an interview with Governor Claiborne ; at which time it 
was deemed expedient to convoke the merchants of the 
city, to adopt precautionary measures for their security. 
The latter, in an animated address, exhorted them to 
assist him in his efforts for the defense of the city, and 
solemnly swore, in the enthusiastic style peculiar to him, 
that, if it were taken by the vessels, he would perish in 
the endeavor to repel the assault. The meeting adopted, 
unanimously, some spirited and patriotic resolutions. A 
considerable sum was subscribed to be distributed as 
bounty among such sailors as might engage to serve on 
board the ships. Many of the guns of the city were 
plaped upon the merchantmen in the river; and a re 
spectable fleet was suddenly formed, to oppose that of the 
British, which was expected from the West Indies. :. ' 

The rumors which had induced this energetic action, 
on the part of the Government, had been but recently 
confirmed by the reception, on the part of the President, 
of the proceedings of a meeting in Wood County, Vir 
ginia, expressive of alarm for the safety of the country, 

* Martin's History of Louisiana. 



148 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

by the accumulating evidences of the complicity of Burr 
and Blennerhasset, in a mysterious and, as many helieved, 
treasonable design. 

The cause of their apprehension proceeded from a par 
tial revelation of the objects of the expedition to some 
of his more intimate acquaintance, by Blennerhassett, 
and to whom, also, he had made a secret acknowledgment 
of the authorship of " Querist." 

Mrs. Blennerhassett, having learned of the meeting, 
and being informed that a battalion of three companies, 
under command of Col. Phelps, were then mustering at 
the Point (Parkersburg), intending to make a descent 
that evening, to burn the mansion and seize the kiln- 
dried corn, dispatched Peter Taylor to Kentucky, to in 
form her husband of the danger with which his person 
and property were menaced. 

On the receipt of the intelligence he immediately left 
for home. Reflecting on his way that he should be un 
provided with the means of defense to protect himself 
against the attack of the militia, he called upon Dr. Ben 
nett, of Mason County, Virginia, to learn any particulars 
of which he was advised, and to secure such aid as the 
Doctor might be able to afford him in the defense of his 
property at the Island. He protested the innocence of 
their designs, and abjured any intention of- a separation 
of the Union, unless by the voluntary act of the people, 
when such a measure should be rendered expedient. He 
communicated the fact of the purchase of the Bastrop 
lands, and desired to enlist such persons as might be 
desirous of emigrating. Taking leave of the Doctor at 
the ferry, he arrived at the Island on the following day. 



GRATEFUL SENTIMENTS. 149 

The excitement had by no means abated. Rumors had 
reached him that an attempt would be made on his per 
son that evening ; but as Col. Phelps had assured Mrs. 
Blennerhassett, during the absence of her husband, that 
she should be protected against violence, he felt no imme 
diate apprehension of danger. On being informed of the 
facts, he dispatched, by a messenger, the following com 
munication to the Colonel : 

WOOD COUNTY, Nov. 3d, 1806. 
COLONEL PHELPS: 

DEAR SIR : Just returned home, after a journey of 
seven hundred miles, I hasten to express to you the satis 
faction with which I learned, on the road, that you had 
been invested with the command of the two volunteer 
companies that had been raised in this country during my 
absence, as that circumstance afforded me a sure guaran 
tee against the idle reports I had heard, of any misguided 
violence intended by my neighbors against my family or 
property while I was not on the ground to defend them. 
But the information my wife has given me of the purport 
of the friendly message you sent her, at a time when you 
thought it would be expedient, has laid me under per 
sonal obligations to you, and rendered it a duty with me 
to endeavor to revive our former neighborly intercourse, 
especially at a season when so much misconception mis 
leads the people, propagated, as I have no doubt I can 
satisfy you, by your enemies and their own, when I shall 
have the pleasure of an hour's unreserved conversation 
with you, in which I expect I can make you some propo- 



150 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

sitlons that will engage your attention and be serviceable 
to jour best interests. I therefore embrace the earliest 
opportunity of soliciting an interview with you, and, in 
consideration of my fatigue, I take the liberty of request 
ing to see you this evening, and accept of a bed with us ; 
or if that should be inconvenient to you, I shall do my 
self the pleasure of attending any appointment you may 
designate for to-morrow. 

I am, dear sir, your obliged and obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 



Col. Phelps to Blennerhassett. 

NEWPORT, Nov. 6th, 1806. 

DEAR SIR : From circumstances of business, it was out 
of my power to attend at Col. Cushing's so early as my 
appointment. A short time after you left there I went 
over, and found your note requesting me to wait upon 
you this day. I am sorry that, from similar circum 
stances, I shall not be able to comply ; but, if you should 
be at home, I shall do myself the pleasure to wait upon 
you to-morrow. 

Your obedient servant, HUGH PHELPS. 

Col. Phelps having visited Blennerhassett, according to 
appointment, the latter thanked him for informing his 
wife of the rumors which were afloat, and the measures 
which had been adopted to arrest the designs of himself 
and associates. He effected, however, to ridicule the 
reports he had heard of the injuries threatened his fam-

ily, and suggested that he suspected the other party in 
the country under the influence of the Hendersons, was 
becoming so strong that its leaders would probably over 
turn the Colonel's interest, on which alone they had 
hitherto depended for whatever popularity they had 
acquired, and cautioned the Colonel against any coalition 
or co-operation they might, seek with him, in exciting 
clamor or suspicion against the views or intentions of 
Aaron Burr or his friends, which the past conduct of the 
Hendersons toward him should induce him to avoid. 

Col. Phelps, in reply, complained much of the ill-treat 
ment he had received from the Hendersons. Blennerhas- 
sett, stated his concern with Aaron Burr in a land pur 
chase ; that he solicited or invited no person to join in 
the emigration, though many had voluntarily offered to 
do so, but added that if the Colonel wished a concern for 
himself or his friends, he might look to the example 
of General Jackson, and other characters of distinction, 
who, Blennerhassett understood, were going to join in 
the settlement with many associates; that, as to the 
rumors and suspicions that had been circulated of Col. 
Burr, or his friends, which accused them of engaging in 
any thing against the laws of the United States, such 
were wholly groundless ; but it was not unlikely that the 
proximity of the purchase to that part of the country 
where an engagement had already taken place, or might 
soon be expected, between General Wilkinson and the 
Spaniards, would engage* Col. Burr and his friends in 
some of the earliest adventures of the war; General 
Jackson being already prepared to march with one thou-

sand or fifteen hundred of his Tennessee militia, when 
ever he should think himself authorized by the orders or 
wishes of the Government to put that body in motion. 
Col. Phelps received this information with declining to 
embark himself, on account of his family and the unset 
tled state of his affairs, but said he had no doubt many 
young men from Wood county would be glad to go with 
Blennerhassett, to whom he would recommend the specu 
lation, as he might have opportunities. 

From General Devereaux. 

BALTIMORE, Oct. 13th, 1806. 
HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. : 

MY DEAREST FRIEND : Your last esteemed letter I have 
duly received. I am both rejoiced and saddened at it. 
.Rejoiced I am, that it should be my good fortune to be so 
kindly held in the light I see I am, by those so dear to 
me, as you and your estimable lady. I am, however, 
both saddened and distressed, that my affairs are not in 
that train to permit me to join you in this month, as I 
had fondly contemplated, and as you so much wish. 
Such is the nature of our business, that it is utterly im 
possible for me to wind it up at present, and this from 
new and unexpected obstacles obstacles which I shall 
fully explain to your satisfaction, and the satisfaction of 
our great and common friend, when we meet. 

How grateful and flattered do I feel, my valued sir, for 
the good opinion you are pleased to express and entertain 
of me. On this subject I shall only further add, that I 
trust I shall never disappoint you in these sentiments, 



PROSECUTION. 153 

and that I may yet have opportunities of evincing my 
gratitude by actions instead of words. 
* Please present your worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett with 
my kindest and best respects, and assure yourself, my 
ever dear sir, of the warm attachment I shall ever feel 
for you, and those that belong to you. 

Yours most truly, J. DEVEREUX. 

p. S. Should you see our distinguished friend shortly, 
recall me to him with that ardent respect and attachment 
which I feel for him. Do n't forget. 

Shortly after his arrival at the island, Blennerhassett 
was joined by Burr, who had also returned from Ken 
tucky and his journey through Ohio. He did not remain 
long, however, at the scene of preparations on the Mus- 
kingum. Having completed his arrangements, he left 
Blennerhassett to superintend the construction of the 
boats, to make the necessary preparation, and to follow 
him, as soon as practicable, to the mouth of the Cumber 
land, with the men, provisions and boats. 

Burr proceeded down the Ohio to Kentucky, where he 
had hardly landed before he was arrested, and carried 
before the United States' Court, on a charge of " treason 
able practices, and a design to attack the Spanish do 
mains, and thereby endanger the peace of the United 
States." He announces the fact as follows : 

LEXINGTON, Nov. 6th, 1806. 

Yesterday, Mr. Jos. Davis, the district attorney of the

Frankfort, for a warrant to apprehend me for treasonable 
practice, or on some suspicion thereof. The charge is 
not well-defined by my informant, but the substance is, 
" a design to attack the Spanish dominions, and thereby 
endanger the peace of the United States." How this 
charge was supported, I have not heard ; but absurd and 
ridiculous as it may appear, the judge has taken time 
until this day to consider if he should refuse to grant the 
warrant. He must expect a tornado of abuse from the 
W. World and some other papers. It is also probable, 
that villains enough may have been found to encounter 
all the perjuries which may be thought necessary to grat 
ify malice. These things taken together, it is fair to 
infer, as probable, that the warrant will be granted. Un 
fortunately this being a proceeding on suspicion, and 
previous to any inquiry by a grand jury, no immediate 
trial can be had, and the object undoubtedly is to give a 
sort of sanction to the charge by this measure, in order 
to influence public opinion. You perceive, my dear sir, 
that this step will embarrass me in my project of the 
Washita settlement. I pray, however, that you will have 
no solicitude about me ; and it will afford me the highest 
gratification, if my friends should feel as little anxiety for 
the result as will be felt by your faithful and affectionate,

The arrest was premature, and Burr was discharged 
for want of evidence. 

Near the middle of November, Graham, the Govern 
ment's confidential agent, proceeded to Marietta, where 
extensive preparations were going on. Here he met, and 
held an interview with, Blennerhassett. After discoursing 
upon the subject of the expedition, with a frankness 
which was only warranted by a well-founded belief (from 
what Burr had previously intimated) that Graham was 
considered as one of the recruits, Blennerhassett read to 
him some communications he had just received by the 
hand of Capt. Elliott, and also from the preceding one 
of Burr, in relation to his arrest and trial at Frankfort, 
upon which Blennerhassett animadverted with great 
severity. Graham finding Blennerhassett was laboring 
under a delusion, in regard to the part that he was to 
perform in the transaction, informed him that Burr's 
representations, as to him (Graham) being with or favor 
ing the expedition, were groundless. With no little sur 
prise, he asked Graham whether he had not heard of an 
association, in New Orleans, for the invasion of Mexico. 
Upon Graham venturing to assure him that there was no 
such association there, Blennerhassett stated that he had 
been informed by Bradford, the printer of the " Gazette 
d'Orleans," that about three hundred men had already 
joined the expedition. 

Considering Blennerhassett most cruelly deceived, Gra- 



156 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ham endeavored to draw him off from the undertaking, 
in which he was engaged ; and conceiving it the policy 
of the Government to prevent, rather than to punish, 
such enterprises, he informed Blennerhassett that, so far 
from heing concerned in the plan, he was the Govern 
ment's authorized agent to inquire into the facts relative 
to the enterprise in the western country, and to take such 
steps as might be necessary for repressing it. He then 
stated to Mr. Blennerhassett, from reasons drawn from 
Burr's visit to New Orleans during the preceding sum 
mer, from the information which the Government had 
received, and from the nature of the preparations which 
Blennerhassett himself was then making, why he helieved 
the object of Burr was either to attack the Territories of 
Spain or those of the United States ; and added, that any 
collection of armed men on the Ohio river would, under 
the circumstances, be considered a violation of the laws, 
and repressed accordingly. 

The object and extent of the preparations at Marietta 
having ben fully ascertained by Graham, according to 
instructions, he visited the Governor of Ohio, at Chilli- 
cothe, to procure the aid of the State authorities in sup 
pressing the suspected formidable measures. Governor 
Tiffin communicated the matter to the Legislature, then 
in session, whereupon an act was immediately passed, en 
titled " An act to prevent certain acts hostile to the peace 
and tranquillity of the United States, within the jurisdic 
tion of the State of Ohio." * 

* Chase's Statutes of Ohio, Vol. I, p. 553. 



INCIDENTS. 1 57 

Under this act, Governor Tiffin ordered out the militia 
of the adjacent neighborhood, under command of Major- 
General Buell, of Marietta, with instructions to that * 
officer to take forcible possession of the boats and stores, 
not only upon the Muskingum, but also of all others of a 
suspicious character descending the Ohio. 

A warlike array of undisciplined militia, with cannon, 
necessary equipage and arms, stationed themselves along 
the banks of the river, to cut off the forces expected from 
above. Many amusing jokes were played off at the 
expense of the raw recruits during this campaign such 
as setting an empty tar-barrel on fire, and placing it in an 
old boat or raft of logs, to float by in the darkness of the 
night. The sentries, after duly hailing, and receiving no 
answer, would fire a shot to enforce their command ; but 
still " dread silence reigned," and calmly the phantom 
vessel, with her stolid crew, floated onward and down 
ward in utter recklessness. Irritated at such manifest 
contempt of their high authority, they plunged into the 
stream to seize the boat and capture its luckless navi 
gators, when naught appeared but the remains of a log 
and a barrel, which some laughter-loving wag had 
freighted for their mischance and his amusement. 

On another occasion, they had learned that Tyler * and 
his men had passed down the river as far as Blennerhas- 
sett's island, from whence he was expected to return, to 
re- capture the boats and provisions. To cut off all possi 
ble communication with Marietta, where the boats were

tied, particular instructions were given, in the evening, 
to bring away all the water-craft from the lower side of 
the Muskingum. Several sailors, who boarded on the 
opposite shore, considered the opportunity for sport too 
favorable to pass unimproved. The plan first proposed 
for the accomplishment of this end, was to raise an 
armed party, with blank cartridges, and fire at the senti 
nels. Upon strict search, however, they found that all 
the muskets, blunderbusses, rifles and shot-guns had been 
previously appropriated by the militia. The cannon was 
then thought of, when this, also, it was ascertained, had 
been called to the aid of the State authorities. Determ 
ined not to be defeated, in the laugh they had promised 
themselves, they resorted to the expedient of emptying a 
half-keg of powder into a canvas sack, wrapping it closely 
with twine. This they deposited under ground, care 
being taken to leave a communication with the contents 
by means of a priming-hole and slow-match. At mid 
night, when all, save the faithful and lonely sentinels, 
were enjoying that repose so necessary to the refreshment 
of the wearied soldier, after a destructive attack

a confused and foreboding sound, from the opposite 
shore, grated unmusically on the ear of the guards. Al 
though appearances were somewhat ominous, yet they 
concluded not to disturb the slumbers of their brothers 
in arms until a more satisfactory demonstration had been

made. For this opportunity they were not kept long in 
suspense. Suddenly the earth began to heave and throe, 
as if drunk with the heel-taps of the soldier's glasses, 
and, following in quick succession, a report, that many 
mistook for the summoning trump of the end of time. 
The scene which succeeded is more easily imagined than 
described. Those less confused did, indeed-, take time to 
adjust their outside garments, but much the greater num 
ber started with nothing but their nether vestments, 
without regard to uniform or military parade. Here 
stood one, vainly struggling to thrust his feet through 
the arm-holes and sleeves of his linsey warmus, while, at 
his side, a companion had drawn his pants over his 
shoulders, illustrating, most ludicrously, but literally, 
the lines of doggerel : 

" Put on his shirt outside his coat, 
And tied his breeches round his throat. 

Shivering, in the chill winds of December, they " hur 
ried in hot haste " to the tanta-ran-ta of the trumpeter, 
and the rub-a-dub-dub of the " drum-major-general." 
Whether any had taken the precaution to "load" or 
"prime" is a question which time and reflection have 
never settled. The major, who was a tailor, is said to 
have charged the cannon with his goose; the State hav 
ing made no provision for ammunition. The deputy, as 
he mounted his horse, was heard to say, that, " as great 
men were scarce, he thought it best to flee from danger." 
Had Tyler and his men been the real cause of their 
alarm, he would doubtless have met with a stern re- 



160 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

sistance, but, fortunately for him, he was unconsciously 
asleep at the Island. 

To Comfort Tyler, a chief assistant from New York, 
had been committed the duties of purveyor. It was 
expected that he would procure the necessary supplies in 
Pittsburgh, and descending the Ohio, join Blennerhassett 
at the Island.- For want of means, and the delay of sev 
eral associates who had appointed to meet him on the 
Ohio, he was detained beyond the time designated for his 
departure. To quiet the apprehension which his absence 
had occasioned, and in answer to a letter which had been 
forwarded from Blennerhassett, he writes as follows : 



PITTSBURGH, Nov. 14^A, 1806. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor, by Capt. Elliot, is duly re 
ceived, for which I thank you. My calculations have 
at all times been to leave Beaver on the first of next 
month. The only difficulty that I have to encounter is, 
the procuring the provisions necessary for my settlers, 
some of whom are behind, and I fear they will not arrive 
in time ; but I shall be off with the few that may happen 
to be with me, and trust to those behind t x o follow on. I 
shall also encourage some gentlemen to forward on flour, 
pork and whisky, with a promise that they may have 
their pay for them on the way. 

I have been unfortunate in having means furnished me 
equal to fulfilling contracts that might have been made 
for the article of whisky, in a particular manner, as the 
merchan-ts are under the necessity of paying ready cash 
for it (they can not procure it on a credit). I expected 



NO SALE. 161 

Mr. Thompson or a Mr. Hopkins would have returned to 
me with some means, to enable me to make greater 
speed, but as they do not come, must suppose they have 
either not met with our friend, who is the principal agent 
in the purchases, or that the distance has been too far for 
them to return by this time. I think, however, that 
before you receive this, one of the men will be at Mari 
etta, on their way to me ; but be assured, that no time 
shall be lost on my part to be ready and on my way by 
the 1st; and by the 8th of the month, can, of course, 
be with you, or, at farthest, on that day. I shall, how 
ever, expect instructions through you, how and where I 
am to call, and of whom I may expect aid in any case : 
not being acquainted with any one, after I leave Beaver, 
I shall therefore expect some person to look for me, with 
your letter of introduction to me, with directions where 
I am to call on you. In the mean time, 

Believe me, dear sir, your faithful friend, 

COMFORT TYLER. 
H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 

On Saturday evening, the 6th of December, the Hon. 
Charles Fenton Mercer, in the course of his journey east 
of the mountains, stopped at the island, with the view of 
purchasing this " most elegant seat in Virginia." Finding, 
however, that Blennerhassett estimated it at fifty thous 
and dollars, which (he remarked) was ten thousand less 
than it had cost him, Mr. Mercer abandoned the idea of 
purchasing ; and the rest of his time, during the visit, 
was spent in conversation with Blennerhassett and his 
11 



162 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

accomplished lady. It turned upon his removal to the 
" Washita " the name of his new purchase. With great 
earnestness, he pressed Mr. Mercer to "become a partici 
pant; suggesting how much it would augment his for 
tune, and enforcing the inducement by an assurance that 
the society he invited him to join would soon become the 
most agreeable and select in America. He spoke of Burr 
as the moral head of it ; and when Mr. Mercer expressed 
a doubt of the permanency and happiness of a union 
formed under such auspices, and dwelt upon such traits 
of Burr's general chai^acter as he deemed exceptionable, 
Blennerhassett vindicated him, with the enthusiasm of 
an ardent admirer. 

Blennerhassett having intended to visit Marietta on 
Sunday evening, Mr. Mercer proposed accompanying 
him, as that was directly on his route. As a tribute of 
merited gratitude, he remarks, that he left the mansion 
in perfect good will to all its inhabitants; regretting 
that the engagements of its proprietor and his own 
dreary journey, but just begun in the commencement of 
winter, forbade him to prolong a visit which, although so 
transient, had afforded him so much pleasure. All that 
he had seen or heard corresponded so little with the 
criminal designs imputed, to Blennerhassett, that, if he 
could have visited him with unfavorable sentiments, 
they would have vanished before the light of a species 
of evidence which, if not reducible to the strictest 
rules of legal testimony, had, nevertheless, a potent in 
fluence ov*er all sensitive hearts ; and which, though it 
doth not possess the formal sanction of an oath, hath 



VINDICATION. 163 

often in it a great deal more truth than statements thus 
verified. 

" What ! " remarks Mr. Mercer, " will a man who, 
weary of the agitations of the world, of its noise and 
vanity, has unambitiously retired to a solitary island in 
the heart of a desert, and created a terrestrial paradise, 
the very flowers, and shrubs and vines of which he had 
planted and nurtured with his own hands ; a man whose 
soul is accustomed to toil in the depths of literature ; 
whose ear is framed to the harmony of sound, and whose 
touch and breath daily awaken it from a variety of melo 
dious instruments ; will such a man start up, in the de 
cline of life, from the pleasing dream of seven years' 
slumber, to carry fire and sword to the peaceful habita 
tions of men who have never done him wrong? Are his 
musical instruments and his library to become the equi 
page of a camp ? Will he expose a lovely and accom 
plished woman, and two little children, to whom he 
seems so tenderly attached, to the guilt of treason, and 
to the horrors of war ; a treason so desperate ? <a war so 
unequal? Were not all his preparations better adapted 
to the innocent "and useful purpose which he avowed, 
rather than to the criminal and hazardous enterprise 
which was imputed to him? Whence arose those impu 
tations ? From his union with Col. Burr. But it is evi 
dent he has been led to this union from his admiration 
of the genius, and confidence in the virtue and honor, of 
the person with whom it lias connected him. That 
which, with a harsh-judging world, is the foundation of 
a belief of his guilt, when thoroughly and candidly ex- 



164 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

am hied, carries on its face, therefore, the stamp of his 
innocence." 

On the same day of the arrival of Mr. Mercer at the 
Island, also landed Comfort Tyler, with his hoats and 
provisions, and a small party of men under his com 
mand. He found Blennerhassett much disheartened as 
to the enterprise, and nearly resolved to abandon it 
altogether. Through the persuasive eloquence of his 
wife, however, who had now enlisted in the undertak 
ing with heroic enthusiasm, and the arrival of Tyler's 
men, " the lord of the isle," as if some demon of evil 
haunted his footsteps, and urged him on to an un 
known destiny, yielding rather to the wishes of others 
than to the dictates of his own better judgment, again 
embarked his fortune and fame in the enterprise of 
Burr. 

The boats and stores at Marietta being in readiness for 
embarkation, orders were issued to the guard to exercise 
the utmost vigilance in preventing their departure. Sus 
picions of the illegal character of the enterprise became 
daily more confirmed. Many had already abandoned it, 
while others hesitated to commit their fortunes to one 
whom popular prejudice condemned, and to whom popu 
lar rumor had attributed such alarming designs. Blen 
nerhassett saw that the storm was rapidly gathering, and 
to delay would result in his own discomfiture and the 
defeat of the expedition. 

On the evening of the 8th of December, a party of 
young men* assembled at the hospitable fireside of a 
3elpr neighbor, were engaged in animated conversation 



ON THEIR MUSCLE. 165 

on the subject of the enterprise before them. They were 
jet young, but ardent and daring, and joined the expe 
dition from the love of adventure, and to visit foreign 
lands. Above all, they desired to realize the enchant 
ments of those vast and far-off savannas which fancy, 
bending her iris of many-colored hues, had draped in 
perpetual verdure, where myriads of blossoms, exhaling 
delicious odors, gemmed the variegated landscape with 
their dazzling sheen. Reposing in the honor and cour 
age of their leaders, they determined to explore that 
unknown world beyond, heedless alike of the admo 
nition of friends, and the perils by which they were 
surrounded. 

The boats at the mouth of the Muskingum were in the 
hands of the authorities, and it was determined to bring 
them away by a coup d'assail. As the night closed in, 
the young men ended their conference, and proceeded in 
a body to the scene of operation. This was their first 
adventure, and became intensely exciting from its nov 
elty. The route lay along the ravine of the Ohio for a 
distance of about twelve miles. The road being nearly 
obscured by over-hanging boughs, the surrounding dark 
ness afforded effectual protection against observation. 
Advancing with caution, they eluded the vigilance of 
the soldiers until they approached the shores of the Mus 
kingum. As they proceeded to unfasten the boats, the 
noise attracted the attention of a sentinel, and the alarm 
was given. An exciting -engagement ensued. No arms 
were used, their efforts being wholly directed to main 
taining the custody of the boats by physical force. 



166 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Friend and foe were equally undistinguishable. The 
contest for a time seemed doubtful, as the middle of 
the stream had been reached, and the darkness rendered 
pursuit difficult. At length, however, they were all re 
captured by the authorities, save one, which with its crew 
was safely conducted to the island, and the young men 
returned to their homes, greatly amused with the inci 
dents of their first engagement. 



BURR IN CYPHER. 16' 



CHAPTER VIII. 

ON the 29th of July, 1806, Burr had dispatched, from 
Philadelphia, by the hands of Swartwout, to General 
Wilkinson, the following communication in cypher : 

" Your letter, postmarked I3th May, is received. At 
length I have obtained funds, and have actually com 
menced. The eastern detachments from different points, 
and under different pretenses, will rendezvous on the 
Ohio, 1st of November. Every thing internal and 
external favors our views. Naval protection of Eng 
land is secured. Truxton is going to Jamaica,* to arrange 
with the Admiral on that station. It will meet us at the 
Mississippi. England, a navy of the United States, are 
ready to join, and final orders are given to my friends 
and followers. It will be a host of choice spirits. Wil 
kinson shall be second to Burr only, and Wilkinson shall 
dictate the rank and promotion of his officers. BURR 
will proceed westward 1st of August, never to return. 
With him go his daughter and grandson. The husband 
will follow in October, with a CORPS of worthies. Send, 
forthwith, an intelligent friend with whom Burr may 
confer. He shall return immediately with further inter 
esting details : this is essential to harmony and concert 
of movement. Send a list of all persons known to Wil 
kinson west of the mountains, who could be useful, with 



168 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

a note delineating their character. By your messenger, 
send me four or five of the commissions of your officers, 
which you can borrow under any pretense you please. 
They shall be retained faithfully. Already are orders 
given to the contractor to forward six months' provision 
to points Wilkinson may name ; this shall not be used 
until the last moment, and then under proper injunc 
tions. Our project, my dear friend, is brought to a point 
so long desired. Burr guarantees the result with his life 
and honor, with the lives, and honor, and the fortunes 
of hundreds, the best blood of our country. Burr's plan 
of operation is to move down rapidly, from the falls, on 
the 15th of November, with the first five hundred or one 
thousand men, in light boats now constructing for that 
purpose, to be at Natchez between the 5th and 15th of 
December, there to meet you, there to determine whether 
it will be expedient, in the first instance, to seize on, or 
pass by, Baton Rouge. ... on receipt of this, send Burr 
an answer, .... draw on Burr for all expenses, etc. 
The people of the country to which we are going are 
prepared to receive us ; their agents, now with Burr, say 
that if we will protect their religion, and will not subject 
them to a foreign power, that, in three weeks, all will be 
settled. The gods invite us to glory and fortune; it 
remains to be seen whether we deserve the boon. The 
bearer of this goes express to you; he will hand a 
formal letter of introduction to you, from Burr ; he is 
a man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed 
to execute rather than project, capable of relating facts 
with fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise. 
He is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions 



THE PLOT PROSPERING. 169 

of , and will disclose to you, as far as you inquire, 

and no further ; lie has imhibed a reverence for your 
character, and may be embarrassed in your presence; 
put him at ease, and he will satisfy you." * 

The mystery in which it was ever the delight of Burr 
to enshroud himself the secrecy with which he had thus 
far conducted his plans, revealing them but vaguely, 
even to those who from their position and aid were 
entitled to his confidence forbids the conclusion that 
Wilkinson had remained unadvised of his designs or 
uncommitted to his enterprise. After the perusal of 
Burr's letter, to believe otherwise would be to charge 
him with madness, and of this he was never accused. 
Wilkinson was known to be friendly to Burr. He had 
held secret conferences with him, at the seat of govern 
ment, only the Spring before, and that, too, after Burr's 
return from the western country, and while actively 
engaged in organizing his schemes. When on the Ohio, 
the closest intimacy had existed between them. Wilkin 
son had freely imparted information of the country, and 
acquainted him with the dispositions of the leading 
inhabitants ; had furnished him with letters of introduc 
tion to his friends, and supplied him with facilities for 
travel. On the 28th of May, 1805, he had written to 
General Adair, from the falls of the Ohio : " I was to 
have introduced my friend Burr to you, but in this I 
failed by accident. He understands your merits, and 



* The words in italics were stricken out, and, in some instances, sup 
plied by others, in the copy which was presented to the Legislature of 
Louisiana by General Wilkinson. His reason for the alteration being to 
divert public suspicion from himself as being connected with Burr. 



170 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

reckons on you. Prepare to visit me, and I will tell you 
all. We must have a peep into the unknown world 
beyond me.* On the 9th of June, in the same year, he 
writes Daniel Clark, of New Orleans : " This will he 
delivered you by Col. Burr, whose worth you know well 
how to estimate. If the persecutions of a great and 
honorable man can give title to generous attentions, he 
has claims to all your services. You can not oblige me 
more than by such conduct, and I pledge my life to you 
it will not be misapplied. To him I refer you for many 
things improper to utter, and which he will not say to 
any other." f Only on the 16th of July, but thirteen 
days previous to the cypher letter, General Dayton, of 
Ohio, had written him : " Your present is more favorable 
than your late position, and as you can retain it without 
suspicion or alarm, you ought, by no means, to return 
from it, until your friends join you in December, some 
where on the river Mississippi. Under the auspices of 
Burr and Wilkinson I shall be happy to engage, and 
when the time arrives, you will find me near you. Write 
and inform me, by first mail, what may be expected from 
you and your associates. In an enterprise of such 
moment, considerations, even stronger than those of affec 
tion, impel me to desire your cordial co-operation and 
active support. Wealth and honor, courage and union, 
Burr and Wilkinson ! Adieu." Again, on the 25th day 
of July, but five days before the date of the cypher let 
ter, Dayton writes : " It is well ascertained that you are

BURR'S DESIGNS. 171 

to be displaced at the next session. Jefferson will affect 
to yield reluctantly to the public sentiment, but yield he 
will; prepare yourself, therefore, for it; you know the 
rest. You are not a man to despair, or even disposed, 
especially when such prospects offer in another quarter. 
Are you ready ? Wealth and Glory ! Louisiana and 
Mexico ! " * 

Again, it was charged that Burr's designs were inim 
ical to the United States ; that his plan comprehended a 
dismemberment of the western country ; that he was to 
seize on New Orleans, and revolutionize the Territory ; 
that, crossing the gulf, he was to land at Yera Cruz, 
march to the city of Mexico, and establish a mighty 
empire, extending from the Apalachian Mountains to 
the borders of the Pacific, of which he himself was to 
be the chief. Several millions of dollars were reported 
on deposit in the banks at New Orleans, which, with a 
feigned regard to the rights of private property, he de 
signed appropriating, with the hope of returning it when 
time and circumstances should render it convenient. 
Burr himself informs Wilkinson, that he will meet him 
at Natchez, " there to determine whether it will be 
expedient to seize on, or pass by, Baton Rouge." And, 
referring to Swartwout, he adds : " The bearer of this 
goes express to you from Burr ; he is a man of inviolable 
honor, and perfect discretion ; capable of relating facts 
with fidelity, and incapable of relating them otherwise. 



* Clark's Proofs against Wilkinson, p. 158. This letter was also in 
cypher, being the same character used in the correspondence between 
Burr and Wilkinson. 



172 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

He is thoroughly informed of the plans and intentions 
of Burr, and will disclose to you so far as you inquire, 
and no further." 

Wilkinson was commander-in-chief of the army of 
the United States, and Governor of JSTatchitoches. His 
whole force was in active service, thoroughly disci 
plined and drilled. Obeying the dictates of honor, as a 
soldier, if not prompted by the impulses of a patriot, 
he was bound by every consideration of duty to arrest 
the progress of the scheme. Of all others, therefore, he 
was the most to be feared, and the most to be avoided by 
Burr. Yet while his plans are but partially revealed to 
his acknowledged confederates, while he diligently en 
deavors to elude the suspicions of his enemies, Burr suf 
fers no opportunity to escape, without fully informing 
him of his designs, and asking his advice upon questions 
of doubtful expediency. To regard Wilkinson, there 
fore, in any other light than a chief accomplice, after the 
perusal of the cypher letter, would render the act of 
writing it the sheerest folly imaginable. 

But Burr was the victim of a misplaced confidence. 
Wilkinson, through considerations of a personal charac 
ter, fully to be explained in a subsequent chapter, revealed 
the plan and fastened the treason upon Burr. On the 
21st of October, he communicated the substance of the 
cypher letter to Mr. Jefferson, then President of the 
United States, who, on the 27th of November, issued his 
proclamation, warning and enjoining those who had been 
led to participate in the unlawful enterprise to withdraw 
without delay, and requiring all officers, civil and mili 
tary, of the United States, or any one of the States or 



ON THE QUI VIVE. 173 

Territories, to be vigilant, each with in his respective 
department, in searching out and bringing to punishment 
all persons engaged or concerned in the undertaking. 

Under the authority, and by virtue of this proclama 
tion, the Virginia militia, of Wood county, were called 
out, by command of Col. Hugh Phelps, of Parkersburg, 
as soon as he had received the intelligence, which was 
not until the 8th or 9th of December. 

On the 10th of the month, Blennerhassett, having 
received information of the preparations making by 
Col. Phelps, who, it was expected, would march to the 
island on the following day, to take possession of his 
person, boats and stores, became much alarmed. 

Having advised with his followers as to the propriety 
of remaining longer under these threatening circum 
stances, it was determined that further delay would be 
perilous to the enterprise. Orders were accordingly 
issued to have every thing in immediate readiness to 
precipitate their departure before the dawn. 

The island soon became the scene of busy preparation. 
It was night, and innumerable lights flitted back and forth 
along the walks, and up and down the river. Voices in 
suppressed tones were heard uttering the words of com-, 
mand, while the muffled oars of the boatmen scarcely rip 
pled the stream. The kitchen fire of the mansion reflected 
the shadowy outlines of bending forms, hurriedly engaged 
in running balls and folding cartridges. No longer the 
halls echoed the peal of merriment. No longer was heard 
the boisterous laugH, the piquant jest, and song of revelry. 
No longer the music of the violin inspired the dance. A 
now zeal had animated them ; the hour for action had ar-

rived ; and, as the curtain lifted on the scene, each man 
assumed his rol in this grand, imposing drama. Such 
was the celerity with which the stores were transported to 
the boats, that, long before midnight, nothing remained 
to delay the embarkation of the new commander and his 
eager followers. 

But, of all that busy crowd, none were more active than 
Mrs. Blennerhassett. An inspired enthusiasm had seized 
upon her, and urged her forward to wonderful effort. She 
seemed indeed the ruling spirit of the occasion. As her 
sylph-like form glided gracefully through the various 
apartments, from kitchen to hall, and from parlor to 
chamber, tarrying a moment to direct a servant, or deliver 
a message from her husband, many paused from their oc 
cupations, to catch a glimpse of the heroine of the expe 
dition, and stood in wrapt admiration of her grace and 
energy. With her, the die had been cast, and on it de 
pended her happiness or her ruin. To retreat, even if re 
treat were possible, involved the loss of property, of social 
relation, and, above- all, her own proud self-respect, which 
never yet had yielded to the temptations of fortune or the 
maledictions of envy. " Onward ! onward ! " she urged 
to the hesitating and doubting husband. "To the pla 
teaux of the sunny South ; to the land of perennial ver 
dure, where grow the citron and the olive, the orange and 
the pine apple ; to the land of gold ; to the Imperial City, 
the gay, the 61ite, the dazzling empire of the new world." 
The prize was indeed a tempting one. But eight years 
previous, they had left the shores of England, as adven 
turers in the forests of the Western world ; they were now 
soon to return, not as private personages, but to the Court 



THE ESCAPADE. ll^> 

of St. James Blennerhassett as the proud representative 
of that giant empire, sweeping in its mighty circumfer 
ence over half of the continent, with its millions of sub 
jects, and she as the heroine of the conquest, and the 
partner of his triumphs. " Go," she urged, " before the 
minions of the Government are upon you. Wait not for 
me and the children ; they dare not molest the mother and 
her innocents. We shall follow at a more opportune sea 
son, and meet again beyond the powers which pursue." 

Calling her maids to her assistance, she busied herself 
in arranging such articles of clothing as might be needed 
by her husband before she could reach him, at the com 
pletion of which nothing was found neglected which could 
contribute to his health or administer to his comfort. 

As the last trunk left the hall, the clock announced the 
hour of midnight the eventful moment of departure. 
Blennerhassett, issuing from his chamber, ordered all 
hands to the river. Drawing her robes about her, his wife 
placed her arm through his, and both proceeded to the 
boats in close consultation. A deep -snow lay upon the 
ground. The winds, sweeping the long reaches of the 
river, sighed among the leafless branches. It was pene 
tratingly cold. On the beach, near the stream, a large fire 
curled its flames into the air, dissipating the immediate 
darkness, and painting spectral forms against the curtain 
of night still further beyond. Encircling this, Blenner 
hassett and his companions held secret council preparatory 
to their final departure. Not the least among these was 
his anxious and hopeful wife. To elude pursuit and pass 
Gallipolis in safety was the subject under immediate dis 
cussion. Nahum Bent was called forward and inquired of, 



176 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

whether he could not furnish horses for Tyler and Blen 
nerhassett, and, crossing the country by land, meet them 
Somewhere in the vicinity of that place, that the two might 
thence proceed through Ohio and Kentucky, to the mouth 
of the Cumberland. But Bent had but one horse, though 
he thought another could be procured from a Belpr 
friend. He was directed by Blennerhassett to visit Cap 
tain Dana, and request the purchase or loan of one, and 
meet him above Gallipolis, where himself and Tyler would 
leave the boats, and, passing around the town, intercept 
them at a point below. 

Mrs. Blennerhassett suggested that less inconvenience 
would be occasioned by taking a canoe, which lay adja 
cent, and on their approach to the town, the two should 
leave the boats, and floating leisurely by in an open vessel, 
used only for short voyages, would awaken no suspicion 
on the part of those who had been set to watch. As 
Blennerhassett was proceeding to give further directions, 
the company were suddenly startled by the abrupt intru 
sion of an officer, who, attracted by the light, had been 
watching their movements during the night. Stepping 
forward to Blennerhassett, he clapped his hand upon his 
shoulder and exclaimed : 

" I arrest you, Harman Blennerhassett, in the name and 
by the authority of the State of Ohio ! " 

Instantly the muzzles of seven or eight muskets were 
leveled at the intruder's breast, and the sharp click of their 
locks sent a thrill of indescribable sensation through every 
nerve. Apprehending fully the danger of his situation, 
General Tapper, as they now distinguished him to be, 
out : 



COL. PHELPS. 177 

" Forbear, men ! Forbear ! Would you act so rashly ? " 

" By the gods ! " exclaimed one, " we will protect our 
selves, at all hazards, from an arrest. If in doing so it 
should become necessary to use our arms, we shall not 
hesitate to shoot, not only you," he added, " but all 
others who may interfere." 

The General, finding resistance had been determined 
on, and that his own person was in imminent peril, 
endeavored to persuade Blennerhassett to reconsider his 
resolution of departure, surrender himself to the Govern 
ment, and stand his trial, assuring him that it would 
satisfy the public indignation and curiosity, and result in 
no particular inconvenience to himself. 

Finding, however, that he was deaf to entreaty, and 
was fully resolved and settled in his purpose, Tupper 
bade him and the party adieu, and wished them a safe 
escape down the river, and a fortunate adventure. 

The conference thus abruptly ended, Blennerhassett, 
bidding his wife an affectionate farewell, with directions 
to follow as soon as her convenience would permit, em 
barked on board, and unmooring the boats, floated down 
the stream.* 

In thus abandoning the partner of his bosom, with her 
helpless and defenseless household, Blennerhassett had 
not mistaken the character of the individual who, he 
rightly presumed, was soon to take charge of his man 
sion. From intimate association with the man, he knew 
that innocence and feebleness would ever be sacredly 
regarded by Col. Phelps ; that, while duty to the calls

178 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

of his country compelled him to exercise the functions 
of his office, and that, too, in defeating the plans of his 
most intimate friend and associate, that power would he 
exerted with the strictest adherence to the laws of hu 
manity and the highest sentiments of honor ; that while 
no menaces would deter him from the disagreeable duty 
imposed, no act of wanton violence should stain the 
honor of the friend. 

On the succeeding morning, Col. Phelps, with a small 
hody of men, proceeded to the island. They found it 
deserted "by its proprietor. Inquiries were made among 
the servants, who informed them of the circumstances 
of the preceding evening ; adding, that Mrs. Blennerhas- 
sett was then on her way to Marietta, to secure, if possi 
ble, the boat originally intended for the conveyance of 
Blennerhassett and his family to the Washita. 

Leaving the greater portion of his men in possession 
of the premises, Col. Phelps started across the country to 
intercept the descending boats, at the mouth of the Great 
Kanawha. None having passed, during the previous day, 
answering to the description of thos-e of which he was 
in pursuit, Col. Phelps informed the citizens of his de 
signs, and procured a party to watch the river that 
night. Accordingly, a large fire was built upon the bank, 
around which the watch attempted to k^ep their mid 
night vigils. Following that ancient custom of "keep 
ing the spirits up by pouring spirits down " like the 
model " officer," who was enamored of the ".landlady of 
France " they soon became oblivious to military duty, 
and reckless of the consequences to result from their in 
attention. Taking advantage of the darkness of the

night, Blennerhassett glided silently by, without disturb 
ing the slumbers of the guard, and, before the early 
dawn, was many miles beyond his discomfited pursuers. 
At the mouth of the Cumberland, he joined the flotilla 
of Burr, which was then awaiting accessions both from 
that river and the Ohio. 

Not apprised, until late, that boats were being con 
structed on the Cumberland, the effect of the President's 
proclamation had been trusted to, for some time, in the 
State of Tennessee ; but, on the 19th of December, simi 
lar communications and instructions with those of the 
neighboring States, were dispatched, by express, to the 
Governor, and a general officer of the western division 
of the State ; and, on the 23d, Graham, the agent, left 
Frankfort for Nashville, to put into activity the means 
of that State also. Burr, however, had been too prompt 
in his movements for the agents of the Government. 
On the 22d of the same month, he had descended the 
Cumberland, with two boats laden with provision and a 
few additional forces. 

The Governor of Kentucky, after the arrest and dis 
charge of Burr, hearing of his arrival at the mouth of the 
Cumberland, with a flotilla of numerous vessels, and that 
he was there congregating his forces, ordered out the 
militia for hfs arrest; but Burr, anticipating the move 
ment, slipped his moorings and proceeded on. 

The flotilla now consisted of four boats under command 
of Tyler, two under Burr, two under Floyd, one under 
Ellis, one under Blennerhassett, and a commissary boat 
under Dean. 

On the evening of the twenty-ninth, Burr stopped a 



180 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

short distance below Fort Massac, then under the com 
mand of Capt. Bissell. The following morning, he was 
visited by that officer, who gave him a polite invitation to 
visit the fort and partake of its hospitalities. It is due to 
Capt. Bissell to state, (although the evidence on this point 
is conflicting,) that he was, at that time, without any in 
structions from the Government. He remarks, that he 
had learned, unofficially, of Burr's arrest and acquittal in 
Kentucky ; hence, he concluded, that his mission was one 
of peace, and for the purpose, ostensibly held out, " of 
colonizing the Bastrop lands." He furnished Burr with a 
messenger, to convey a communication to the lead mines 
in Missouri, as well as one or two men for his enterprise, 
and a small quantity of provision ; the latter, however, 
Bissell asserts, was sent by his wife, who was an early 
acquaintance of Burr, and who returned it, in compliment 
for a barrel of apples which Burr had forwarded to her. 

On the evening of the third of January, 1807, Burr, 
with one boat, landed at Chickasaw Bluffs, a military sta 
tion at that time commanded by Lieut. Jacob Jackson. 
He immediately dispatched a messenger to the commander 
of the fort, to inquire if quarters could be furnished him 
during the night, who shortly returned with an affirmative 
answer. The following morning, he had an interview 
with Jackson, on the subject of the expedition, in which 
he stated that he was going on a project of which many 
wished to know, but, from their inquisitiveness, he was 
not disposed to gratify them, but assured him that it was 
an enterprise which would be honorable to him, Jackson, 
and would be the making of those who should follow 
him, provided they survived the undertaking. Every ar- 



181 

gument was resorted to, to shake the fidelity of that 
young officer, to his country, and prevail on him to join 
the expedition, with the whole of the forces under his 
command. To the ardent and enthusiastic mind of youth, 
panting for scenes of glory and distinction, his offers of 
fame and emolument were truly tempting ; particularly as 
they were enforced hy the sophistical reasoning of that 
astute and experienced diplomatist. But, to his honor, 
and to the honor of American youths, particularly Ameri 
can officers, he foiled the attempts of the seducer, and 
came off moral victor in the attack. While in the service 
of his country, no offer of wealth, or place, or power, 
could decoy him from the path of rectitude. The Govern 
ment had confided the command of that fort to his 
youthful hands, and so long as he retained that trust, his 
best energies should be exerted to preserve it with fidelity 
and honor. 

On the 3d of January, 1807, the President dispatched 
the following communication to Gen. Wilkinson : " I 
had yesterday intended to recommend, to Gen. Dearborn, 
the writing to you weekly, by post, to convey informa 
tion of our affairs in the West, as long as they are inter 
esting ; because it is possible, though not probable, you 
might sometimes get the information quicker this way 
than down the river ; but the General received, yesterday, 
information of the death of his son in the East Indies, 
and, of course, can not now attend to business. I, there 
fore, write you a hasty line, for the present week, and 
eend it in duplicate by the Athens and Nashville route. 

" The information in the inclosed paper, as to the pro 
ceedings in the State of Ohio, is correct Blennerhassett's 



182 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

flotilla, of fifteen boats and two hundred barrels of 
provisions, is seized, and there can be no doubt that 
Tyler's flotilla is also taken ; because, on the 17th of De 
cember, we know there was a sufficient force assembled 
at Cincinnati to intercept it there, and another party was 
in pursuit of it on the river above. We are assured that 
these two flotillas composed the whole of the boats pro 
vided. Blennerhassett and Tyler had fled down the 
river. I do not believe that the number of persons en 
gaged for Burr has ever amounted to five hundred ; 
though some have carried them to one thousand or 
fifteen hundred. A part of these were engaged as set 
tlers of Bastrop's land, but the greater part were engaged 
under the express assurance that the projected enterprise 
was against Mexico, and secretly authorized by this Gov 
ernment. Many expressly enlisted in the name of the 
United States. The proclamation, which reached Pitts 
burgh, December 2d, and other parts of the river suc 
cessively, undeceived both these classes, and, of course, 
drew them off; and I have never seen any proof of their 
having assembled more than forty men, in two boats, 
from Beaver, fifty in Tyler's flotilla, and the boatmen of 
Blennerhassett. I believe, therefore, that the enterprise 
may be considered as crushed ; but we are not to relax in 
our attentions until we hear what has passed at Louis 
ville. If every thing, from that place upward, be suc 
cessfully arrested, there is nothing from below that [is] 
to be feared. Be assured that Tennessee, and particu 
larly General Jackson, is faithful. The orders lodged 
at Massac and the Chickasaw Bluffs, will probably secure 
the interception of such fugitives from justice as may

escape at Louisville ; so that I think you will never see 
one of them. Still, I would not wish, till we hear from 
Louisville, that this information should relax your prepa 
rations in the least, except as far as to dispense with the 
militia of Mississippi and Orleans, leaving their homes, 
under our orders of November 25th. Only let them con 
sider themselves under requisition ; and be in a> state of 
readiness, should any force, too great for your regulars, 
escape down the river. You will have been sensible that 
those orders were given while we supposed yo,u were 
on the Sabine, and the supposed crisis did not admit 
the formality of their being passed by you. We con 
sidered Fort Adams as the place to make a stand, be 
cause it covered the mouth of Red river. You have 
preferred New Orleans, on the apprehension of a fleet 
from the West Indies. Be assured, there is not any 
foundation for such an expectation, but the lying exag 
gerations of these traitors to impose on others and swell 
their pretended means. The very man whom they 
reported to you as having gone to Jamaica and to 
bring the fleet, has never been from home, and has 
regularly communicated to me every thing which had 
passed between Burr and him. France or Spain would 
not send a fleet to take Yera Cruz ; and, though one 
of the expeditions, now near arriving from England, is 
probably for Yera Cruz, and perhaps already there, yet 
the state of things between us renders it impossible 
they should countenance an enterprise unauthorized by 
us. Still, I repeat, that these grounds of security must 
not stop our proceedings or preparations until they are 
further confirmed. Go on, therefore, with your works 



184 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

for the defense of New Orleans, because they will always 
be useful, only looking to what should be permanent 
rather than means merely temporary. You may expect 
further information as we receive it; and, though I 
expect it will be such as will place us at our ease, yet 
we must not place ourselves so, until we be certain, but 
act on the possibility that the resources of our enemy 
may be greater and deeper than we are yet informed. 

" Your two confidential messengers delivered their 
charges safely. One arrived yesterday only, with your 
letter of November 12th. The oral communications he 
made me are truly important. I beseech you, take the 
most special care of the two letters which he mentioned 
to me the one in cypher, the other from another con 
spirator of high standing and send them to me by the 
first conveyance you can trust. It is necessary that all 
important testimony should be brought to one center, in 
order that the guilty may be convicted and the innocent 
left untroubled." 

On the 5th of January, having supplied himself with 
thirty pounds of lead and three dozen tomahawks, to 
gether with other articles, Burr proceeded down to 
Palmyra, and thence to Bayou Pierre. 

NOTE. THE FOLLOWING is A JOURNAL OF BLENNERHASSETT'S VOYAGE 
DOWN THE RIVER: 

16th December. Tuesday, we left Jeffersonville ; crossed the falls; 
nothing extra; all our boats crossed safe. 

ITih. Pursued our journey at twelve o'clock at night ; landed at Salt 
river ; took in seven hands ; stopped some time ; and started again at four 
o'clock in the morning. About ten o'clock, A. M., parted with Colonel 
Tyler, and four keel-boats left us. We had a very bad night, occasioned 
by heavy rain, which continued until morning. 



VOYAGE DOWN. 185 

18th. Nothing remarkable; passed Anderson's river at thirty-five min 
utes past two o'clock, A. M. ; passed one of the keel-boats at twelve o'clock 
at night. 

19/A. Passed French Island at half-past nine, A. M. ; passed Green river 
at half-past eleven, A. M. About one, P. M., had some trouble about a canoe, 
which some of our hands, being ashore after wood, had taken away. The 
owner followed ; we had to pay him two dollars, and give up the canoe. 
Nothing more worth notice, until we arrived at Red Bank, then about sun 
down ; found it to be a place of small note ; there we remained two hours, 
and proceeding, passed Diamond Island about twelve o'clock at night. 

20th. About five, P. M., met with some difficulties among some sawyers, 
which is a term given by boatmen to old trees, which settle in the river, 
and which rise and fall by the rapidity of the current. They are often 
dangerous, and sometimes fatal. Immediately after disengaging our 
boats from the difficulty, we were prevented from proceeding by a ledge 
of rocks; with much hazard we cleared ourselves about seven; passed 
Highland Creek, where stands a town of small note, entirely inhabited 
by Roman Catholics. At half-past nine passed the Wabash river, came 
up with Colonel Tyler and his boats. In the forks of the Ohio and 
Wabash, stand a few houses, but of no consequence. The latter river 
here is of considerable magnitude, and runs into the Ohio, opposite the 
center of an island, which takes its name from the river. The Ohio, here, 
has a beautiful appearance, interspersed with handsome plantations along 
its banks. Four miles below the mouth of the Wabash, there is a large 
island, the name unknown to us. At half-past twelve, P. M., arrived at 
Shawneetown : this is a place of deposit for the salt, made at the saline, 
but of no other importance, being a place of no trade. 

2lst. Nothing remarkable. 

22d. Nothing in the course of the day, but had a very wet night. 

23rf. A beautiful day ; nothing extra. 

2th. Very windy ; repaired our boats, they being very leaky in the 
rbofs. At eleven o'clock, P.'M., an express arrived from Colonel Burr 
informing us of his intentions to meet us at Cumberland river; likewise 
orders for us to proceed; but we were prevented by high winds, BO 
remained that night. 

Burr to Blennerhassett. 

NEAR NASHVILLE, Dec. 20, 1806. 

My young friend Stokely Hays, the son of a respectable old revolution 
ary officer, will hand you this, and will bring me your reply. I have 
experienced distressing delays ; but shall be at the mouth of the Cumber 
land on the 23d, Sunday. Please to repair thither. Enter on the east 
(upper) side of the island, which lies in the mouth of the river. 
I anticipate impatiently the pleasure of meeting you. 

A. BURR. 
H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



186 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

25th. Left Shawneetown at eight o'clock, A. M. ; the wind fresh and 
ahead. Passed an island, name unknown to us. This day the wind blew 
so hard, that our boats were totally separated ; with much difficulty our 
boat reached the Kentucky shore, after riding a tremendous swell; re 
mained until sundown, and then proceeded on to join the rest of our 
company, who were in the same dilemma, being obliged to put in on the 
Indiana shore. 

26^. About five o'clock, A. M., one of Mr. Blennerhassett's boats joined 
us, being one of fifteen that were stopped at Marietta. At half-past seven 
o'clock passed the Rock and Cave; went ashore and viewed it; found no 
curiosities, more than a hollow cavern. Passed Hurricane Island and Creek 
at half-past ten o'clock; passed Clover Creek, eleven o'clock, on the In 
diana side ; passed the Copperas Banks at half-past three, P. M., Indiana 
shore. 

27th. Arrived at Cumberland river, at half-past , A. M.; joined 

Col. Burr, at the above place. The day was very stormy, and put our lit 
tle fleet to considerable trouble. 

Burr to Blennerhassett. 

SUNDAY EVENING. 

It is said that you have landed a mile below. We must all be stationary 
till morning. Send to me by return of this boat, Mr. Hays, with five 
hundred in twenty post notes, and fifty dollars in silver. 

We will endeavor to start all the heavy boats at an early hour in the 
morning : those below are to wait till those above shall come down. A 
gun will be fired as a signal for moving. 
All is well, very well, at this garrison. 

Your friend, 

A. BURR. 

P. S. Mr^ Elliot has handed me some money. The silver is necessary, 
if it can be come at, and about three hundred dollars of paper. Hays 
need not come. 

28th. This day a boat joined us from Cumberland river, with Cols. 
Burr, Harris, etc., on board. Pushed off on our journey, and landed on 
the Kentucky shore eight miles distant from the above place. In conse 
quence of high winds, we landed about eight o'clock, P. M. 

2$th. This day pushed off at eight o'clock, A. M. ; wind ahead and 
strong; obliged to land immediately opposite the mouth of Tennessee 
river, where we lay by for several hours ; pushed off again at sundown, 
and passed Fort Massac at half-past eleven, P. M., and landed one mile 
below. 

30th. Pushed off at five o'clock, A. M. ; pleasant weather; came into 
the Mississippi at half-past three o'clock; passed the Iron Banks at half- 
past eight o'clock, and passed the Chalk Banks at half-past nine, A. M. 



JOURNAL CONTINUED. 



187 



31st. Pleasant weather; nothing happened worth notice. Landed, at 
sundown, on the Louisiana shore. 

January 1st. This day landed at New Madrid, at nine o'clock, A. M.; 
remained about three hours, and left one of our hands, Major G. Wood, 
behind with a canoe, in order to engage some men that purposed coming 
on with us. This evening on coming ashore, owing to our being in rear 
of the fleet, and going after dark, our boat ran aground, but got off with 
some difficulty, and effected a good landing in a short time. 

2d. Pushed off this day at four o'clock, A. M.; passed the little prairie 
at eight o'clock ; fine weather ; landed at five o'clock at the Little Horse-shoe. 

3^ Pushed off this day about five, A. M. ; passed a number of islands ; 

saw no inhabitants. I believe the whole of the fleet, our boat only ex- 
cepted, got into an eddy ; we escaped only, and by our timely exertions 
gained the opposite side of the island and river, say the right hand side; 
the rest put ashore. Although contrary to Colonel Burr's orders, we alone 
pushed on. 

4^. This day at seven, A. M., we landed at the Chickasaw Bluff, where 
there is an American garrison, commanded by Lieut. Jackson. 

6th. This day at six o'clock, A. M., left this place, and floated all day, 
and landed at nine, P. M., on an island, in consequence of a very high 
wind ; pushed off again at eleven o'clock. 
6 ^.Floated all day; nothing extra. 
7th. Do. 
8th. Do. 

9M. Floated all day, until two o'clock, P. M. ; landed to wait for Col. 
Burr; got some wood; perceived the sign of horses, but no inhabitants 
any where to be found; pushed off again at three o'clock, being joined by 
the Colonel and his boats; floated all night through a very dangerous 
navigation; about eight o'clock one of Col. Tyler's boats being lashed to a, 
flat, and striking against a sawyer, was broken loose, in consequence of 
which Capt. Dean's boat stopped, and dispatched a keel-boat in search of 
the one lost. Major Floyd's boat put ashore, in consequence of being de 
terred by a sudden squall of wind, which arose about eight o'clock ; the 
rest of the boats proceeded. 

IQth. At four o'clock, A. M., got into an eddy; could not get out, the 
night being very dark ; stayed until daylight appeared ; then got out, and 
came up with Col. Burr's two boats, namely, the boat he lived in, and one 
that had horses ; they gave us a signal for landing, with which we complied,x 
and effected a landing in the Mississippi Territory. About twelve o'clock 
this clay, Col. Burr pushed down the river with a bateau and twelve men, 
and appointed to meet us again at Bayou Pierre ; passed Palmyra at half- 
past one o'clock'; passed several islands, and landed about fifteen miles 
below. 

11 th. This day pushed off at eight, A. M., and landed at Bayou Pierre 
at four o'clock, P. M. ; joined Col. Burr and party; had some intention of

staying at this place some time, but were prevented by a rumor spreading 
in the country of our intentions being hostile, in consequence of -which a 
party of militia came and stationed themselves in the woods, some dis 
tance from our boats, with an intention to stop us the next morning. 
We being apprised of their intentions, pushed off in the night, and landed 
four miles below, on the Louisiana shore. 

12th. This day were visited by Col. and some of his dragoons,* 

talked with Col. Burr respecting his business, and went away well satis 
fied. This day Major Floyd joined us from Natchez. 

13th. This day were visited by Col. Fitzpatrick and some of his dra 
goons ; we brought them over the river; talked with Col. Burr, and 
seemed well pleased. Col. Fitzpatrick brought with him about sixty men, 
all armed, in order to stop us ; but on hearing our business, he sent the 
men home, and left us quietly. 

14th. Visited by several militia officers. 

IQth. Visited by Col. Shields, Gov. Williams's aide-de-camp, who con 
versed with Col. Burr, and appointed a meeting between him and the 
Governor, and then departed. 

17th. This day Col. Burr started, agreeably to his appointment, to meet 
the Governor at the mouth of Cole's Creek, with several gentlemen with him. 
This day was remarkable for a heavy fall of snow, perhaps four inches deep. 

18th. The water falling rapidly, we thought it prudent to remove from 
our situation ; and, agreeably to the orders of Mr. Blennerhassett, two of 
our boats moved down the river about a mile, being afraid of being blocked 
in by a bar that was outside of the creek, where we then lay. 

Wth. This day Col. Fitzpatrick, with some other officers, came on board, 
and took an inventory of all the stores and property we had on board ; 
we then pushed off, but were immediately challenged by a Major Flaharty, 
with about thirty armed men, in a keel-boat, who ordered us to put on 
shore. Being told that his Colonel was in the rear, and that it was by his 
sanction we put off, he left, and troubled us no more. That night we put 
on shore at the Petit Gulf, on the Louisiana side ; Major Flaharty and 
party immediately opposite, on the other side. 

2Qtk. This day, about ten o'clock, in consequence of a very bad land 
ing, we thought proper to remove our boats up the river, which we effected. 
This day several boats trading to New Orleans were stopped by Major 
Flaharty and party, examined, and permitted to proceed. 

[ The rest of this Journal is in the handwriliny of Harman Blennerhassett.~\ 

In the evening the Major visited H. B. ; professed friendly intentions, 
and a determination to join us, with the greater part of his regiment. 

2lst. We received news of the approach of a Capt. Davison, with a party 
of horse, coming, under the orders of Col. Fitzpatrick, to search for concealed 
arms, supposed to have been secreted in the brush ; during the night a party 
was sent out by to obviate effectually the success of the design. 



JOURNAL, CONTINUED. 189 

22d. This morning an altercation took place between Majors Floyd and 
Flaharty, which induced the former to address a letter to the latter in a 
sort of defiance. This measure having been taken without my approba 
tion, I informed Major Floyd I would not co-operate with him in any acts 
he should enter into upon his letter or motives, but should, by myself and 
my party, resist such conduct on the part of Major Flaharty as I should 
deem improper, or as occasion required. Major Floyd, I believe, appre 
hending no attack or removal of our boats from their present station, 
seemed to yield to my observation, and in the morning made a visit to 
Major Flaharty, to engage with him in a shooting-match. On his return 
to the boats, he informed me that Major Flaharty, this evening, expected 
fresh orders from the Government, to enable him to move our boats down 
to Cole's Creek. Eleven o'clock at night, there were several shot fired 
from Major Flaharty's party on boats passing by to bring them to, but 
without effect. Damage to the boats or their men unknown. This morn 
ing Col. Comfort Tyler was taken from his boats, by an escort of the 
militia, to appear before the Governor at Washington, the seat of the Ter 
ritorial Government, about thirty miles from our station. The officer, 
Capt. Davison, who made the requisition to Col. Tyler, observed to him 
that he had no warrant. Col. Tyler agreed to the Governor's wishes with 
out that requisite. This day Major Flaharty, who can neither read or 
write, and is not a magistrate, informed me that he had taken and for 
warded to the Governor the affidavit of a man, who deposed before him. 
that he had seen, fifty miles above our present position in the Petit Gulf, 
thirteen of Col. Burr's boats containing arms and ammunition, with an 
unusual number of men. During several days past, some individuals of 
our party have been obliged, at Washington, to undergo examination, and 
enter into recognizance to testify, on the part of the United States, against 
A. B. at the next federal court, to be held on the first Monday in February. 

About ten o'clock this morning, Major Floyd communicated to me the 
following letter, received by Capt. Burney from Major Flaharty : 

January 23d, 1807. 

SIR : Not wishing to go to rash measures, I have to inform you that I 
must comply with the orders of the commander-in-chief, if you keep your 
present position; and, as I am certain that it can't be injurious to your 
self nor any of the people with you, I wish you to move opposite the 
mouth of Cole's Creek, where the communication is more convenient for 
you and me. You mentioned in your letter to me, yesterday, that you did 
not wish to put the militia to any more trouble. Your compliance will save 
the march of two companies that are ready to join me, if called on. 
I am, with much esteem, 

Yours, etc., 

JACOB FLAHARTY, 
MAJOR FLOYD. Major, 2d Regiment. 



190 THE BLENNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

On perusal of the above letter, which Flaharty could not write, I ac 
quainted Major Floyd that if it was worthy of credit in the intimation it 
held out of the orders of the commander-in-chief, and the truth of his 
menaced reinforcements of two companies, it might as well answer our 
present views and situation to comply as to adhere to the determination 
expressed yesterday, of maintaining our present position ; that, on the 
other hand, the Governor would be as responsible to us and the law for any 
impropriety of conduct toward us by the militia, as for any other acts of 
authority unduly exercised toward us. I therefore suggested to him the 
substance of the following letter in reply to Flaharty : 

PETIT GULF, January 23c?, 1807. 

SIR: Your communication, by the hands of Capt. Burney, I just now 
had the honor of receiving. You mention your wish for us to move to the 
mouth of Cole's Creek; the request I would take a pleasure in complying 
with, had not Col. Burr directed me to stay where we now are until his 
further commands. I do expect to have a messenger from Col. Burr to-day, 
perhaps time enough to move down this evening. At all events, we will 
determine, to-morrow morning (23d), what step will be proper for us to 
take. Report says, the officer commanding the district opposite you is 
determined to prevent the commanding officer of the Mississippi Territory 
from interfering with the jurisdiction of the Territory of Orleans. This 
report, if true, may be proper for you to be informed of. At all events, 
we are awaiting a legal investigation into our conduct ; and I contend 
that, during that investigation, and while we are, properly speaking, in 
the hands of its authority, the military law has no right to interfere. I am, 

Respectfully, etc., 

DAVIS FLOYD. 
MAJOR FLAHARTY. 

This letter, by means of the unfounded suggestion, submitted to Major 
Floyd, of the jealousy of the people on the Louisiana side, of any en 
croachments on their jurisdiction, or by other matter it contained, pre 
vented Flaharty from carrying his declarations into effect, if he really 
had authority under orders from the Governor so to do ; and he was re 
moved from his post opposite to us the following morning (24th), on the 
arrival of Col. Fitzpatrtck, who substituted only a party of ten men, under 
the command of Capt. Abrams, with orders to board boats civilly, without 
firing upon them, and seize only such arms and ammunition as they might 
contain. Col. Burr, this day, returned to the boats from Washington, 
where he had remained since the 17th under a voluntary submission to the 
civil authority, which had been exacted of him at Cole's Creek, on his 
reception there on the 17th by Mead, at the head of five or six hundred 
of the militia, half armed and generally discontented, in disregard of the 



DEMORALIZATION. 191 

connection that had been entered into by Mead and himself. The Acting- 
Governor, it now appeared, had threatened him with all the armed force of 
the country unless he submitted. No securities, however, were required 
for his appearance at the adjourned Federal Court, to be holden on the first 
Monday in February. His own single recognizance was taken, in the sum 

of dollars. Accordingly, his return to the boats was free. I soon 

heard from him that Mr. Mead had received dispatches announcing the 
statements by Flaharty of what had passed between him and Major Floyd, 
which so exasperated the Governor, that he threatened to have Floyd 
brought to him in irons, but was induced to retract his menaces on learn 
ing Flaharty's character to be fraught with the utmost ignorance and 
assurance, while Major Floyd's temper was both mild and amiable. Col. 
Burr also acquainted me with the indignation the Federal Judge, Rodney, 
had expressed at the exercise of the military law over Col. Burr and his 
friends, both in the Mississippi and Orleans Territories ; the Judge assur 
ing him, in opposition to the U. S. Attorney, Mr. Poindexter, that the civil 
authority of the Territory was competent to try him ; adding, at the same 
time, that if Wilkinson, or any other military force, should attempt to 
remove his person out of the Mississippi Territory, prior to his trial, he, 
the Judge, would again, as he expressed it, put on old '"76," and march 
out in support of Col. Burr and the Constitution. This day, about three 
o'clock in the afternoon, my family arrived in the boat of Mr. Thomas 
Butler, who, having, on his way from Pittsburgh, called to take them on 
board at my house, on the Ohio, there underwent, with eight or ten other 
gentlemen, a captivity for three days, diversified in its scenes by a mock 
trial, in my hall, alternate insult and plunder, committed in common on 
them, my family and property, in a variety of particulars, for which I 
refer to Mr. Neville's journal. 

2,5th. Nothing material occurred till eight o'clock at night, when we 
cast off to drop down about twenty-six miles, to Cole's Creek, opposite 
which we took another station on the Orleans shore. Here we remained, 
without any material prospect of a change in our affairs, till the 27th, when 
we heard that intelligence had reached Mississippi Territory that Col. B.'s 
drafts on New York had been protested, and that Gov. Williams, who had 
returned to resume the functions of his office in the Mississippi Territory, 
was reported to be friendly disposed toward us. Col. B. determined to 
visit the Governor, and set out next morning (28th) for that purpose, and 
to prepare, probably, for his trial on the following Monday. Reports now 
reached us of the near approach to Natchez of a division of nine or ten 
gun-boats, under the command of Commodore Shaw, bearing a special order 
from the "Secretary of the Navy" to take Col. Burr, or the next in com 
mand uncj^r him, and to take or destroy all the boats under his command. 
By this time the effects of general disorder and want of regulation in the 
use or distribution of liquors and provisions, with a total disregard of all 
pretense at authority whenever attempted to be assumed by superiors, 



192

which had long since manifested themselves throughout all our numbers, 
now openly broke out among particular leaders, who even threatened to 
turn out of their boats the provisions, in payment for the demands of some 
of the men who had become discontented and threatened to leave us. 

2Qth. Nothing occurred till 2d of February, when the Court at Washing 
ton had not that day charged the grand jury, who, of course, had not found 
any bill against Col. Burr, owing to objections, I suppose, made by the 
Attorney-General, to the jurisdiction of the Court over actions done by 
Col. Burr, without the limits of their Territory. Next day (Feb. 3d), 
Mr. N. brought me intelligence of the arrival of Graham at Washington, 
and of his having had an interview with Col. Burr. 



YOUNG AMERICA. 198 



CHAPTER IX. 

MORGAN NEVILLE and William Robinson, jun., with a 
party of fourteen young men, early in December, em 
barked from Pittsburgh, in a flat-boat. Most of these 
were sons of gentlemen of affluence and ease, who knew 
but little of the realities of life, farther than was learned 
within the walls of an academy. 

They had proceeded down the river, as far as Parkers- 
burg, when their boat was driven on the shore by 
the ice during the night, and they were espied by the 
Wood county militia, and the whole party arrested as 
accomplices of Burr. 

With " savage magnificence," they were escorted to 
the island, to await the return of Col. Phelps, who was 
then absent, at Point Pleasant, in an ineffectual attempt 
to arrest Blennerhassett. Somewhat chagrined at their 
luckless adventure, so far, the young men endeavored to 
pass their time as pleasantly as possible, by ridiculing 
the militia, and threatening them with the strong arm 
of the law. 

But the intrepid captors were not to be deterred from 
duty. They parried the sarcasm of their adversaries, 
and occasionally retorted with considerable effect. The 
impertinence of the captives, at length, becoming insup 
portable, three justices of the peace were sent for, to 
13 



194 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

institute an examination into the facts, to commit for 
further trial, or acquit, the young men, as the evidence 
might warrant. 

They were accordingly arraigned, and, after a full 
investigation of the facts, mostly upon the evidence of 
the young men themselves, the court acquitted them of 
all hostile designs against the United States. 

"During the trial, the moh-spirit of the militia began 
to run riot, and, by the time it was ended, all was con 
fusion. The well-stored cellars of the mansion began to 
pour forth their riches ; drunkenness ensued ; fences 
were torn down, to pile upon the blazing fire of the sen 
tinels ; the shrubbery was trampled under foot." 

In the midst of this scene of confusion, Mrs. Blenner- 
hassett returned from her unsuccessful visit to Marietta, 
whither she had gone to procure the family boat of 
Blennerhassett. A scene of such desolation and ruin 
of all that was fair and beautiful, and around which her 
young affections had clung with fond associations, was 
calculated to crush a heart whose native character was 
remarkable for its strong attachments to the objects of 
its love ; but she had long since resigned her beautiful 
abode, for the more tempting lands which her imagina 
tion had dressed in fancy's brightest colors, where serener 
skies and gayer flowers " shed their mingled delights " 
over the perennial green of nature's bosom. The suc 
cessful issue of the expedition was to her a matter of 
weightier moment than all other considerations; and, 
thus it was, she remained unmoved amid the general 
wreck of her fair possessions, by the ruthless mob. 



COL. PHELPS. 195 

Her situation, however, was one of painful embarrass 
ment. Blennerhassett, having departed in haste, with 
out making arrangements for her voyage, and the refusal 
of the authorities, at Marietta, to deliver her the boat, 
constructed for that especial purpose, left her, for a time, 
in almost hopeless despair of joining her husband at the 
appointed place. The weather had been intensely cold, 
and the fast-accumulating ice, in the Ohio, appeared to 
forbid a re-union with Blennerhassett until the following 
spring, when, in all probability, she could only find him 
in the Spanish dominions. It was, therefore, with feel 
ings of mingled gratitude and pleasure that she accepted 
the proffer of a room in the boat of Thomas Butler, one 
of the young men, who promised to make the accommo 
dations as comfortable to herself and children as the 
circumstances of her situation would permit. 

During the course of the evening, Col. Phelps returned 
from his tour across" the country. In this unexpected 
arrival, the young men had new cause of anxiety and 
alarm. They had congratulated themselves upon their 
successful defeat of the functionaries of the law, which 
they attributed mainly to their superior tact in mystify 
ing their judges, and intimidating their accusers ; but 
here was one who could not be duped by sophistical 
reasoning, or swerved from his duty by the fear of con 
sequences. Although dressed in the usual style of the 
backwoodsmen of that day, the careless manner in which 
he wore his garb added gracefulness to a form both 
attractive and commanding. They recognized in him, 
an individual of physical as well as intellectual superi 



196 



THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 



ority, and therefore wisely concluded to assume a differ 
ent bearing from that they oefore had observed toward 
their captors and judges.* 

In a thoughtful and classic attitude, he surveyed the 
destruction of the premises, and the evident marks of 
bacchanalian revelry, by which the party under his com 
mand had disgraced themselves ; then, turning upon them 
a look of withering rebuke, he spoke in such terms of in 
dignation as caused them to shrink with fear and trepi 
dation. " Shame ! men," he exclaimed ; " shame on such 
conduct ! You have disgraced your district, and the 
cause in which you are concerned ! " 

To the party of strangers, however, he was courteous 
and attentive. They soon ascertained that they had no 
cause to apprehend the frustration of their plans by Col. 
Phelps ; indeed, so far from that, he willingly acceded to 
their wishes, in permitting the departure of Mrs. Blen- 
nerhassett, and proffered his services, in accelerating her 
arrangements to go to her husband, who, he said, he 
knew could never return to her. To Mrs. Blennerhassett 
he expressed his deep sense of mortification, for the riot- 



* The following anecdote of him, related by General Cass, in his work 
styled " France, its King, Court and Government," is perfectly character 
istic. He says : 

" I recollect a similar incident, which took place in a small village upon 
the banks of the Ohio. The court was in session, and the presiding officer 

was a Colonel P , a man of great resolution, and of herculean frame. 

A person entered the court cabin, and, by his noise, put a stop to the pro 
ceedings. He was ordered out, and the sheriff attempted to remove him : 
but he put himself upon his reserved rights, and made such a vigorous re 
sistance that the officer retired from the contest. Colonel P , there 
upon, descended from the bench, coolly took off his coat, gave 'he 
brawler a severe beating, and, after putting him out of his house, resumed 
his garment and his seat, and continued his judicial functions." 



DESERTION. 197 

ous acts of his misguided men, and assured her, of what 
she was already aware, that if he had been present, the 
shameful act would not have occurred. 

" Early next morning, Mrs. Blennerhassett commenced 
her preparations for a final farewell of the island Eden, 
where, for eight years, she had been the presiding genius. 
Her energy and zeal were such, that, in a few hours, she 
took possession of the humble chamber prepared for her 
in the boat, and, by the assistance of Col. Phelps, who 
rivaled the young men in courtesy, the necessary stores 
and furniture were embarked. On the 17th day of De 
cember, the boat swung from the shore, lashed to another 
of the same class, belonging to A. "W. Putnam, of BelpreY' 

In the latter part of December, they passed the mouth 
of the Cumberland, where it was expected she would join 
her husband; but, as we before have shown, he had 
passed out of the Ohio into the waters of the rapid Mis 
sissippi, and moored at the entrance of Bayou Pierre. 
Early in January, she was restored, with her children, to 
Blennerhassett, who received them with that deep-felt 
affection which a parent and husband can only appreciate. 

The situation of Burr and Blennerhassett had now 
become one of painful ^ anxiety. It was evident, from 
surrounding circumstances, that the strong hands of the 
general and State governments had become too powerful 
for the small forces under their command. Burr saw that 
he was the "victim of bad faith." Those who had 
favored the enterprise at first, and gave him to understand 
that their aid could be relied on, abandoned their designs, 
upon the issuing of the President's proclamation. The 
authorities of the States and Territories bordering on the 



198 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Ohio and Mississippi rivers had ordered out the militia, 
for the apprehension of the parties ; and, from Pittsburgh 
to the Gulf, the most rigid measures had been adopted, to 
give an effectual check to the further progress of the 
expedition. 

As for Blennerhassett, his situation was cheerless in 
the extreme. For Burr, had he abandoned his home with 
all its endearments, his books, his studies, his property, 
and, withal, was deeply involved for debts contracted for 
the enterprise. As if the furies were not yet satiated in 
their revenge, he was hunted and pursued, as a malefac 
tor, and momentarily expected the chi-lling touch of the 
officer of the law, to summon him to justice. 

On a dark and dreary night, in the month of January, 
as the flotilla pushed slowly from the landing at Petit 
Gulf, might have been observed the master-spirit of the 
expedition, seated on a rough stool, in the inclement 
cabin of a flat-boat, lighted' only by the cheerless rays of 
a solitary candle, and the decaying embers of a rudely- 
constructed fireplace. With his face buried in his hands, 
while his elbows rested on a table of unplaned boards, he 
who had heretofore braved the disappointments which 
had attended his undertaking, with a fortitude that 
astonished, while it gave confidence to, his followers, 
now sat gloomy and dejected. Upon what he mused is 
beyond human ken; but, starting suddenly from his 
revery, he caught up an axe, and directed his attendant 
to make an opening in the side of the boat. Through 
this, in the silence of the night, when he supposed there 
was none to witness, the chests of arms for the expedition 
were silently sunk beneath the waters of the Mississippi. 



POINDEXTER. 199 



CHAPTER X. 

COWLES MEAD, secretary of the Mississippi Territory, 
performing the duties of Governor, had, on the third day 
of December, 1806, issued his proclamation for the arrest 
of " the Burr conspirators ; " and, at the same time, call 
ing on the officers of the Government to take the oath 
of fidelity to the United States. To this proclamation, 
Burr, on the 12th of January, 1807, replied in a letter of 
some length, in which he disavowed any designs hostile 
to the tranquillity of the country, stating that his only 
object was a peaceable settlement of the lands of his new 
purchase. " If the alarm which has been excited," he 
remarks, " should not be appeased by this declaration, I 
invite my fellow- citizens to visit me at this place (Bayou 
Pierre), and to receive from me, in person, such further 
explanations as may be necessary to their satisfaction, 
presuming that when my views are understood, they will 
receive the countenance of all good men." This letter, 
he requested, might be read to the militia, who, he under 
stood, were assembled for his arrest. 

Having moved his boats to the western margin of the 
Mississippi river, a short distance below Bayou Pierre, he 
was visited by George Poindexter, Esq., the Attorney 
General of the Territory, who had been appointed by 
Mead as an honorary aid-de-camp for the arrest of the 



200 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

parties. The object of this visit was to gain correct in 
formation as to the situation of Burr ; to ascertain his 
views, so far as they might be communicated; and to 
procure his peaceful surrender to the civil authorities. 

Major Shields, who accompanied Poindexter, delivered 
to Burr the following letter from the Acting-Governor : 



WASHINGTON, January 15fA, 1807. 

SIR : Your approach to this country has excited not 
only the apprehensions of the General Government, but 
alarmed, in a high degree, the good citizens of this Ter 
ritory. From these causes I have ordered my militia to 
rendezvous at such places as will enable them to guard 
this Territory against any design inimical to this govern 
ment; but having heard, through Col. Waldridge, that 
you profess perfect innocence of the views charged to 
you, I hav.e thought proper to send to you a confidential 
aid-de-camp, to receive from you such information on 
this subject as you may please to make. He will com 
municate freely with you, and you may implicitly confide 
in every assurance which he may make in my name. I 
have the honor to be, 

Your humble servant, 

COWLES MEAD. 
To Col. A. Burr. 

P. S. The gentleman attending Major Shields, is an 
honorary aid, and one who likewise possesses my fullest 
confidence. Mr. Poindexter, though a high civil officer, 
visits you as my aid. Yours, etc., 

COWLES MEAD. 



SURRENDER. 201 

The sentence relating to guarding the Territory against 
any designs inimical to the Government, Burr repeated 
with a sneer, adding that he had no intention to injure 
the citizens of the United States. "As to any projects 
or plans," he continued, " which may have been formed 
between General Wilkinson and myself, heretofore, they 
are now completely frustrated by the perfidious conduct 
of Wilkinson ; and the world must pronounce him a per 
fidious villain. If I am sacrificed, my portfolio will prove 
him to be such." He stated further, that, so far from 
having any designs hostile to the citizens of the United 
States, he intended to have met Mr. Mead, at 'Port Gib 
son, on the day of the general muster, which happened 
at that place about the time of his arrival at Bayou 
Pierre ; but was deterred from so doing, by the belief 
that he would be assassinated, if seen passing through 
the Territory. 

Mr. Poindexter then requested him to surrender him 
self peaceably to the civil authorities ; stating that, un 
less he did, the Governor would certainly arrest him by 
force. Burr declared his willingness at all times to sub 
mit, and proposed that an interview should take place 
between himself and the Acting- Governor, at some con 
venient place, on the next day ; claiming protection from 
personal violence in the mean time. 

Stipulations were entered into, by which it was agreed 
that Burr should be returned to his boats, if Mead should 
not accept of his surrender ; that his flotilla should re 
main in the position it then occupied, until after the pro 
posed interview should have taken place ; and that, in 



202 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the mean while, his men should commit no breach of the 
peace, or violate any law of the United States or Missis 
sippi Territory. The place designated for the conference 
was the house of Thomas Calvert, a respectable citizen 
of the Territory, who resided near the mouth of Cole's 
Creek, where the detachment of militia which descended 
the river was stationed. 

Burr, accordingly, on the seventeenth day of January, 
dropped down the river as far as Thomas Calvert's, ac 
companied by Col. Fitzpatrick, who directed him to be 
taken in charge by Captain Davidson's company of dra 
goons. Here he was joined, according to appointment, 
by Mead ; when further stipulations were required as to 
the terms of his surrender. These were, first, that the 
agreement entered into, for the purpose of procuring that 
interview, should be declared void. Secondly, that Burr 
should give himself- up, unconditionally, to the civil 
authority. And, thirdly, that his boats should be searched, 
and all military stores and apparatus found on board be 
disposed of, as the Executive should think fit. 

To these terms, the Acting-Governor required Burr's 
unequivocal reply, in fifteen minutes ; and, if not agreed 
to, he was to be instantly returned to his boats, and the 
militia ordered to seize the whole party by force. 

As there was no chance of escape, the conditions were 
accepted of and carried into effect. Burr declared his 
unwillingness to fall into the hands of Wilkinson, and 
requested, if any attempt should be made to arrest him 
by a military force from iN"ew Orleans, that it miglit be 
opposed. He was conducted to the town of Washington, 



THE JURY. 203 

where lie was delivered over to the custody of the law, 
and the examination of the witnesses immediately com 
menced hefore Judge Eodney. 

Mr. Poindexter was called on, in his official capacity as 
attorney-general, to give his written opinion as to the 
course which ought to be pursued. He, accordingly, fur 
nished an able argument against any attempt to try the 
accused in the courts of the Territory. He stated that 
they had no evidence to convict him of any offense com 
mitted in Mississippi ; that the Supreme Court of the 
Territory, to which a jury was about to be summoned, 
had no original jurisdiction of any prosecution, and could 
only take cognizance of law reserved at the trial in the 
Circuit Court. It was his opinion, therefore, that Burr 
should be sent to the city of Washington, where the Su 
preme Court of the United States would be in session ; 
and the judges, attending from every part of the Union, 
could direct him to be tried in the District, where, from 
the evidence, it might appear that an overt act of treason 
had been committed. 

But Judge Rodney thought differently ; and a venire 
facias was issued, requiring the attendance of seventy-six 
jurors, at an adjourned session of the Supreme Court of 
the Mississippi Territory, to be held in February. From 
the number attending, at the appointed time, a grand 
jury of twenty -three persons was selected, who received 
a charge from the judge and were adjourned until the 
next day. 

The following morning, a motion was made, by the 
attorney-general, to discharge the grand jury ; first, be 
cause the court did not possess original jurisdiction in any 



204 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

case ; secondly, because the depositions, submitted to his 
inspection, did not furnish sufficient evidence to convict 
Burr of the offenses with which he was charged, so as to 
bring them within the Mississippi Territory ; and, thirdly, 
that a warrant might issue, transmitting the accused to a 
court having competent jurisdiction, to try and punish 
him, if guilty of the crime alleged against him. The 
court being divided on this motion, it was, in conse 
quence, overruled, and the grand jury retired. The 
attorney-general, thereupon, determined to prefer no in 
dictment, and left the court-room. r H 

In the afternoon the jury returned with the following 
presentments : 

"The grand jury of the Mississippi Territory, on a due 
investigation of the evidence brought before them, are 
of opinion that Aaron Burr has not been guilty of any 
crime or misdemeanor against the laws of the United 
States, or of this Territory ; or given any just cause of 
alarm or inquietude to the good people of the same. 

" The grand jurors present, as a grievance, the late 
military expedition, unnecessarily, as they conceive, fitted 
out against the person and property of the said Aaron 
Burr, when no resistance had been made to the civil 
authorities. 

" The grand jurors also present, as a grievance, destruct 
ive of -personal liberty, the late military arrests,* made 
without warrant, and, as they conceive, without other 
lawful authority; and they do sincerely regret that so 
much cause has been given to the enemies of our glorious

Constitution, to rejoice at such measures being adopted, 
in a neighboring Territory, as, if sanctioned by the Ex 
ecutive of our country, must sap the vitals of our polit 
ical existence, and crumble this glorious fabric in the 
dust." 

The attorney-general declared his astonishment at such 
unwarrantable presentments by the grand jury, and, in 
forming the court that he should take no notice of them, 
retired. Judge Rodney strongly reprobated such conduct 
on the part of the jury, and, after rating them in no very 
mild terms, dismissed them without delay. 

In the evening of the day on which the court sat, Burr 
visited the house of Colonel Osborne. He had asked to 
be discharged from his recognizance, as he had fully com 
plied with its terms ; but, learning that it was the inten 
tion of Gov. Williams to seize on his person the moment he 
was discharged by judicial authority, he requested John 
Dana, one of his force from Belpre*, with two others, to 
convey him, in a boat, to a point about twenty miles from 
Bayou Pierre, whence he could escape across the country. 

Before leaving, he hastily advised Mrs. Blennerhassett 
of the result of the investigation, as follows : 

WASHINGTON, January 3Ist, 1807. 
MRS. M. BLENNERHASSETT : 

Our persons and our property are safe from violence 
and from pursuit. It is with regret and mortification 
that I acknowledge, that, at present, nothing more can be 
said ; yet there is reason to hope for something more, for 
permission (how humiliating ! ) to go on to Washita. 

My presence is necessary here, and will be so for three 



206 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

or four days. The separation from my friends is extremely 
irksome and painful. Adieu. A. BURR. 

Procuring a boatman's dress, in which to disguise him 
self, he proceeded on his tour. Upon hearing of his 
escape, Williams issued a proclamation, offering two 
thousand dollars for his apprehension and safe delivery to 
the proper authorities. A few days afterward, a negro 
boy was discovered near the mouth of Cole's Creek, oppo 
site which the boats were stationed, riding on a horse 
which belonged to Burr, and having on his surtout coat. 
These circumstances created a suspicion; the boy was 
searched, and, sowed up in the cape of his coat, was found 
a note to the following effect : 

" If you are yet together, keep so, and I will join you 
to-morrow night. In the mean while, put all your arms 
in perfect order. Ask no questions of the bearer, but tell 
him all you may think I wish to know. He does not 
know that this is from me, nor where I am." 

To C. T. and D. F * 

From Blennerhassett' s journal it appears that, to add to 
their discomfiture, they learned that Burr's drafts on New 
York had been returned protested. General disorder 
reigned among his followers, who having indulged to ex 
cess in the use of ardent spirits, and witnessing the total 
destruction of his enterprise, had thrown off all authority, 
and threatened to appropriate the supplies in compensa 
tion for their wages. 

In consequence of the discovery of Burr's letter to

MORE ARRESTS. 207 

Tyler and Floyd, the men were arrested and placed under 
guard, where they were detained until the alarm was 
over. Many, if not all of them, were permitted occa 
sionally to walk about, free of restraint, on their parole 
of honor. 

In the mean while, several arrests of the supposed ac 
complices of Burr had been made at Fort Adams and 
New Orleans. Among the number were Bollman, Ogden, 
Swartwout, Adair, Dayton, Smith and Alexander, against 
whom the most rigid and unjustifiable authority had 
been exercised by General Wilkinson; in many cases 
upon bare suspicion, and without resistance at any time 
to civil authority. General Adair, who had arrived at 
New Orleans on the 10th of January, was besieged by 
one hundred and twenty men, under command of Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Kingsbury, accompanied by one of Wil 
kinson's aids. They seized upon him while at dinner in 
a public-house, dragged him from the table, and con 
ducted him to head-quarters, where he was placed in 
confinement, and secreted, until an opportunity offered to 
convey him away.* It was even attempted, in the Legis 
lature of Louisiana, at the suggestion of the Governor,

to suspend the writ of habeas corpus that inestimable 
guarantee to the liberties of every American citizen, 
more effectually to aid the harsher application of mili 
tary law and military dictation. 

Toward the writs of habeas corpus, issued by the courts, 
to bring the accused parties before them, Wilkinson ob 
served the most profound contempt. So ineffectual was 
the process of the courts, in bringing either the prisoners 
or Wilkinson before them, that Judge Workman recom 
mended to the Governor, that Wilkinson should be 
opposed by force of arms. He stated that the violent 
measures of that officer had produced great discontent, 
alarm and agitation in the public mind ; and unless such 
proceedings were effectually opposed, all confidence in 
Government would be at an end. He urged the Governor 
to revoke the order, by which he had placed the Orleans 
volunteers under Wilkinson's command, and to call out 
and arm the rest of the militia as soon as possible. He 
stated it as his opinion, that an army would not oppose 
the civil power, when constitutionally brought forth, or 
that if they did, the Governor might soon have men 
enough to render the opposition ineffectual.* 

Eb satisfactory answer having been made to Workman 
by the Governor, he again addressed him on the subject. 
It was notorious, he remarked, that the commander-in- 
chief of the military forces had, by his own authority, 
arrested several citizens for civil offenses, and avowed on 
record, that he had adopted means to send them out of 
the Territory, openly declaring his determination to usurp

DILEMMA. 209 

the functions of the judiciary, by making himself the 
only judge of the guilt of the persons he suspected, and 
asserting in the same manner, and without contradiction, 
that his measures were taken after several consultations 
with the Governor. 

Although a common case would not require the step 
he was taking, yet he deemed it his duty, before any 
decisive measure was pursued against him, who had all 
the regular force, and, in pursuance of the Governor's 
public orders, a great part of the Territory at his disposal, 
to ask whether the executive had the ability to enforce 
the decrees of the court of the county ; and if he had, 
whether he would deem it expedient to do it in the pres 
ent instance ; or whether the allegations, by which Wil 
kinson supported the violent measures, were well founded. 

" Not only the conduct and power of "Wilkinson," he 
continued, " but various other circumstances peculiar to 
our present situation the alarm excited in the public 
mind, the description and character of a large part of the 
population of the country might render it dangerous in 
the highest degree to adopt the measure usual in ordinary 
cases, of calling to the aid of the sheriff the posse comi- 
tatus, unless it was done with the assurance of being sup 
ported by the Governor in an efficient manner." 

The letter concluded by requesting a precise and speedy 
answer to the preceding inquiries, and an assurance that 
if certain of 'the Governor's support, the judge would 
forthwith punish, as the law directed, the contempt 
offered to the court. On the other hand, should the 
Governor think it impracticable to afford the required 
aid, the court and its officers would no longer remain

exposed to the contempt or insults of a man whom they 
were unable to punish or resist. 

The same silence and indifference having been observed 
by the Governor toward the last, as toward his former 
communication, "Workman resigned his office as he had 
before indicated.* 

Burling, who had been sent to Mexico, returned, with 
out having accomplished the object of his mission. It 
appears that, instead of his being sent " to penetrate the 
veil which concealed the topographical route to the city 
of Mexico, and the military defenses which intervened," 
as alleged by Wilkinson, he was, on the contrary, com 
missioned to display to the viceroy the great pecuniary 
sacrifices made by that general, to frustrate the plan of 
invasion meditated by the Ex-Vice-President against the 
kingdom of Mexico, and to solicit, in consideration of 
such important services, a pretty round sum of at least 
two hundred thousand dollars.^ 

Don Joseph de Yturrigaray received this communica 
tion with due contempt and indignation, bidding his in 
terpreter to tell Mr. Burling that General Wilkinson, in 
counteracting any treasonable plan of Mr. Burr, did no 
more than comply with his duty ; that he, the viceroy, 
would take good care to defend the kingdom of Mexico 
against any attack or invasion ; and that he did not think 
himself authorized to give one farthing to Gen. Wilkin 
son, in compensation for his pretended services. He, 
thereupon, ordered Burling to leave the city of Mexico,

and had him safely escorted to the port of Yera Cruz, 
where he embarked for l^ew Orleans. 

On the seventh of December, previous, Wilkinson had 
dispatched Lieutenant Swann, of the army, to Jamaica, 
with a letter to the officer commanding the naval force 
on that station, informing him of Burr's plans, and that 
a report was afloat that the aid of a British naval arma 
ment had been either promised or applied for : he there 
fore warned him, and all other British military and naval 
officers, that their interference, or any co-operation on 
their part, would be considered as highly injurious to the 
United States, and affecting the then present amicable 
relations between the two nations. The communication 
concluded with a hope, that the British government 
would refrain from any interference, and prevent indi 
viduals from affording aid to the enterprise; assuring 
him that the writer would, with all the force under his 
command, resist any effort of a foreign power to favor 
Burr's projects. 

To this Admiral Drake replied, that, from the style 
and manner in which the communication was written, he 
was at a loss how to answer it ; but begged him, Wilkin 
son, to be assured, that British ships of war would never 
be employed in any improper service, and that he should 
ever be ready most cheerfully to obey the orders of his 
sovereign. Sir Eyre Coote trusted, and sincerely be 
lieved, the representations made to Wilkinson were to 
tally groundless, as his letter contained the only intelli 
gence received on the subject.*

Bollman and Swartwout were conducted to the city of 
Washington for trial. After having been imprisoned, 
for some time, on the charge of treason, as joint-conspira 
tors with Burr, they were discharged from confinement, 
by order of the Supreme Court, as the evidence was not 
sufficient to retain them longer in custody. 

Ogden and Alexander were transported to Baltimore, 
as accomplices in the same crime. The former of these 
was taken before a magistrate, in the city, and set at lib 
erty for want of sufficient proof. The latter was released, 
in "Washington, whither he had been recently conducted, 
because of the improper averment of the offense. 

Blennerhassett, having learned that Graham, while in 
the vicinity of the island, had obtained the affidavit of 
Col. Phelps, which, among others, had been forwarded 
to the President, addressed him the following letter : 

DOUGLAS FERRY, Feb. 24, 1807. 
J. GRAHAM, ESQ. : 

SIR : Having heard, from respectable authority, that 
you have forwarded to the President an affidavit of Hugh 
Phelps, wherein he deposed that I had imparted to him 
certain views or objects, in which I participated with 
Col. Burr, hostile to the United States, or to some of the 
Spanish dominions, I am naturally led to inquire how far 
I may inflame or abate the persecution, with which I am 
honored by the Government or its agents, by proposing 
to you to forward another affidavit, to the same quar 
ter, deposing that Col. Phelps had declared, soon after 
the only interview I had with him, that I did not commu 
nicate to him the object. I can not pretend to state the 



PROTESTATION. 213 

facts that may appear on the face of the affidavits on 
either side, until such documents come forward, any more 
than the tenor of fifty other affidavits or testimonies I 
can procure from my neighbors of respectable character, 
who will testify to the very contrary of what Col. Phelps 
has done men, all of them, possessing my good opinion, 
and believing Mr. Phelps is the last man in the world I 
would venture a secret with, if I had any. 

Provided, sir, with such means of counteracting the 
evidence of Mr. Phelps, or any other that may be ad 
duced against me, I can have no other solicitude for the 
issue of an arraignment any where than the intervening 
distress in which my family will be thereby involved. 
But as this nor any other consideration shall ever influ 
ence me to shrink from investigation, I now, sir, invite, 
through you, all the justice or persecution of the Grovern- 
ment. Why, or how, I may have become personally ob 
noxious to them, or to yourself, the public may hereafter 
understand. But if I am singled out as an early victim 
or example, I shall wish not to be severed from my 
family, by being thrown on board a prison ship, while I 
tender security for my appearance at the city of Washing 
ton or elsewhere, whenever it may be required. 

I request your answer, and with due consideration, 
I remain, sir, your obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

Blennerhassett was arrested and recognized to appear 
at the next District Court for the Territory of Mississippi, 
where we shall leave him for the present, to follow the 
fortunes of Burr. 



214 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 



CHAPTER XI. 

LATE at night, about the last of February, Burr, with a 
companion, arrived at a small log tavern, in what is now 
the village of Wakefield, in Washington county, Alabama. 
Without alighting, he called at the door, and inquired 
of the inmates if Colonel Hinson resided in the neigh 
borhood. Receiving for answer that he did, they further 
informed him that the house was seven miles distant ; the 
road to be traveled, obscure and difficult ; and a deep and 
turbid creek lay in the route. 'Nothing daunted, he 
eagerly sought information as to the forks, and directions' 
as to crossing the stream. This having been communi 
cated, he put spurs to his horse, leaving the observers 
involved in astonishment. 

Near midnight, the glimmering of a light, through the 
distant trees, directed the travelers to the rude but com 
fortable quarters of Colonel Hinson. Having hailed and 
received no answer, they dismounted and entered the 
kitchen, where the remaining embers in the fireplace 
were soon kindled into a comfortable blaze. Seating 
himself before it, Burr left his companion to take charge 
of the horses, and had just begun to feel comfortable, 
when he was interrupted by a stranger, who, he con 
cluded, had ridden till late to reach desirable lodgings. 
But in this he was mistaken. The real cause of his 



HESITATION. 215 

appearance, at this unseasonable hour, originated in 
Burr's mysterious departure from the inn. As it after 
ward appeared, Colonel Nicholas Perkins observed, by 
the light of the fire, as Burr sat upon his horse, that, 
although he was coarsely dressed, yet he possessed a 
countenance of unusual intelligence ; an eye of sparkling 
brilliancy ; and a demeanor wholly unsuited to the garb 
he wore. The tidy boot, in particular, which his vanity 
could not surrender, with his other articles of finer cloth 
ing, attracted Perkins's attention, and led him to con 
clude that the gentleman before him was none other than 
the famous Colonel Burr, described in the proclamation 
of the Governor. 

Perkins immediately started after Theodore Bright- 
well, the sheriff, who occupied an adjacent cabin ; and, 
awakening him from his slumbers, hurriedly communi 
cated the circumstances of the traveler's appearance, 
conversation and departure, and requested him to join 
him in the pursuit of the parties. Bright well consented ; 
and the two, mounting their horses, took the road to 
Hinson's. The night was cold and windy, and the moan- 
ings of the lofty pines, along the solitary road, rendered 
their journey gloomy and inauspicious. Still they pressed 
on; for the object of their pursuit was of no small im 
portance, at that particular time, to the minions of the 
Government. As they arrived in sight of the illuminated 
dwelling, Perkins, recollecting that the travelers had seen 
him at the tavern, declined entering, but sent Brightwell, 
whom he requested to return to him, at a certain place in 
the woods, after he had ascertained whether or not the 
suspicious individual was Aaron Burr. 



216 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

As Brightwell called at the door, his voice was recog 
nized by Mrs. Hinson, who was his relative, and who 
until now had remained silent in another room, through 
fear of the strangers, in the absence of her husband. She 
soon prepared something to eat for her unknown guests. 
As Burr seated himself at the table, he thanked her, in 
the most courteous terms, for her kindness, and apolo 
gized for the trouble he had imposed upon her. His con 
versation was sprightly and agreeable, so much so, indeed, 
that Mrs. Hinson soon discovered that the gentleman and 
his attire did not correspond. His attention was often 
directed to Brightwell, who stood before the fire, and at 
whom he cast the keenest glances, evidently endeavoring 
to read his thoughts. A momentary separation having 
taken place during the night, between Burr and his com 
panion, at the suggestion of Brightwell, the latter was 
asked by Mrs. Hinson if she had the honor of entertain 
ing, as her guest, the celebrated Col. Burr. Fearing to 
make the disclosure, the man remained silent, and shortly 
after left the room. 

Early in the morning, Burr privately communicated to 
Mrs. Hinson his real name, and regretted the absence of 
her husband, whom he had seen at Natchez, and with 
whom he had promised himself to remain a week ; but 
that, as he was detected, he should prosecute his journey. 

After inquiring the route to Pensaeola, and Mrs. Car 
son's ferry on the Tombigbee, he called for writing 
materials, and indited several letters. His companion, 
who had been dispatched on the back route, for some 
purpose, returned about nine o'clock, and the two again 
set out for the " cut-off,'' not very far distant. 



RE-ARREST. 217 

For some unaccountable reason, which has never yet 
been explained, Brightwell neglected to return to Per 
kins, whom he left highly excited and shivering in the 
cold. Having remained at his post until his patience was 
exhausted, and supposing that Brightwell, probably on 
account of the fascinations of Burr, or the pity which 
had seized him, in his behalf, had betrayed their plans, 
Perkins mounted his horse, and rode rapidly to the house 
of Joseph Bates, at Nannanhubby Bluff, to avoid the 
creek which intervened on the main route to Fort Stod- 
dart. Here he was furnished with a canoe, and a negro 
to navigate it, and, descending the Tombigbee, arrived at 
the military station early in the morning. The late Gen 
eral Edmund P. Gaines was then the lieutenant in com 
mand. Perkins briefly acquainted him with the particulars 
of the preceding night's adventure, and of his suspicions, 
which, although of slight foundation, had nevertheless 
impressed him with solid convictions of truth. Placing 
himself at the head of a file of mounted soldiers, the 
lieutenant started in pursuit, accompanied by Perkins. 
They shortly encountered the object of their search, with 
his traveling companion, and the sheriff, Brightwell. 
The parties having met, Lieutenant Gaines accosted one 
of the strangers, remarking, that he presumed he had the 
honor of addressing Colonel Burr. 

" I am a traveler," answered Burr, " and in a strange land, 
and do not recognize your right to ask such a question." 

" I arrest you, at the instance of the United States," 
replied Gaines. 

" By what authority do you arrest me, a stranger on 
the highway, on my own private business ? " 



218 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The lieutenant then informed Burr that he was an 
officer of the United States army, and held in his hand 
the proclamation of the President, as well as that of the 
Governor of the Mississippi Territory, directing his arrest. 

Burr asked him if he was aware of the responsibility 
of arresting a traveler ; to which Gaines answered, that 
he was perfectly aware of his duties, in the premises, and 
should endeavor to perform them. 

Burr then entered into a brief argument to show that 
these proclamations should never have been issued, and 
that in following their dictates, the lieutenant would be 
subjecting himself to much damage and blame. His 
manner was firm ; his air majestic ; and his language 
impressive ; but the resolute young officer told him his 
mind was made up ; the prisoner must accompany him 
to his quarters, where he would be treated with all the 
respect due the Ex-Vice-President of the United States, 
so long as he made no attempt to escape. He was then 
conducted toward Fort Stoddart, where the parties ar 
rived in the evening, and an apartment being assigned 
the prisoner, he took his dinner alone. 

Late at night, a groaning was heard in an adjoining 
room. Burr arose, opened the door, and ascertained that 
George S. Gaines was suffering from severe indisposition. 
He approached the sufferer's bed and kindly offered his 
services, as he had traveled much, and had some knowl 
edge of medicine. They soon entered into a sprightly 
conversation in regard to the state of the country, and 
particularly on the subject of the Choctaw Indians, 
among whom Gaines lived, as United States factor. The 
next day, being introduced to the wife of the command- 



A HARD ROAD. 219 

ant, who was a daughter of the late Judge Toulman, 
Burr dined with the family, and enlivened the company 
with his wit and elegant discourse. In the evening, he 
played chess with Mrs. Graines, with whom he was often 
a frequent competitor in that interesting game. Of 
nights, he sought the company of the invalid, who be 
came exceedingly attached to his society. During their 
midnight conversations, how often would the good heart 
of his auditor grieve over the misfortunes of Burr. But 
it was a remarkable fact, that, as often and long as they 
were together, this unfortunate man never once alluded 
to his arrest, his troubles, or his future plans. From his 
early youth, it had been his custom to conceal things in 
relation to himself, and he always endeavored to throw 
an air of mystery over his acts. 

After Burr had been secured, as a prisoner at Fort 
Stoddart, Perkins departed for Wakefield, and caused the 
arrest of his traveling companion, who proved to be 
Major Ashley. He was placed under a guard, from 
whom he escaped and made his way to Tennessee, where 
he afterward made himself serviceable to his friend, in 
collecting evidence in his behalf for the trial at Rich 
mond. 

Three weeks had passed away since the arrest of the 
distinguished prisoner, and still the lieutenant had been 
unable to convey him to the seat of the general govern 
ment for trial. The difficulties were great, and, for a 
time, the undertaking appeared impracticable. In those 
days, there were comparatively no roads, no ferries, and 
few men could be found, in that sparsely-settled country, 
who would undertake a journey so long and perilous, 



220 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

over savage lands. The inclemency of the weather, at 
that season of the year, added much to the unpleasant 
ness of the tour, and, with many, formed an insuperable 
objection, as they must, necessarily, for want of houses 
of accommodation, be exposed, both night and day, to 
the vicissitudes of the month of March. At last, Burr 
left the fort, under guard, and proceeded, in a govern 
ment boat, up the Alabama river, into the Tensaw lake, 
accompanied by Lieutenant Gaines, and stopped at the 
house of John Mills. The ladies of the house, seeing 
the strait to which Burr was reduced, wept, through sym 
pathy for his misfortunes. One of the number, it is said, 
a Mrs. Johnson, named her son in honor of this distin 
guished individual. He is still alive, and is not the only 
boy bearing the name of "Aaron Burr" in the State of 
Mississippi. The ladies every where espoused his cause, 
in the south-western JSTew World. It is a prominent and 
noble trait, in female character, to admire a man of dar 
ing and generous impulses, and to pity and defend him 
in his adversities. 

At the boat-yard, in the present county of Baldwin, in 
the State of Alabama, the crew disembarked, where 
"William and John Pierce (who introduced the first cotton 
gins into Alabama) had a trading establishment. Gaines 
gave the command of the guard to Perkins, and directed 
him to convey the prisoner to Washington city. His 
guard consisted of Thomas Malone, of Alabama, Henry 
B. Slade, of North Carolina, two McCormacks, of Ken 
tucky, and two United States' soldiers. They were all 
men whom Perkins selected, and upon whom he could 
rely in any contingency. He took them aside, and ob- 



IX THE FOREST. 221 

tained the most solemn pledges, that, upon the whole 
route to Washington, they would hold no interviews with 
Burr, nor suffer him to escape alive. Perkins knew the 
fascinations of Burr, and he feared his familiarity with 
his men ; indeed, he feared the same influences upon him 
self. His character, for making strong impressions upon 
the human mind, and attaching men to him by associa 
tion, was well known to the world. 

When Burr fled from the authorities in the Mississippi 
Territory, he had disguised himself in a boatman's dress. 
His pantaloons were of coarse, copperas-dyed cloth, with 
a roundabout of inferior drab. His hat, a flapping, wide- 
brim beaver, had, in times long past, been white, but now 
gave evidence of having encountered much rough weather. 
Placed upon his fine horse, he bestrode him most elegant 
ly, and flashed his large, dark eyes, as though he were at 
the head of his New York regiment. Each man carried 
provisions for himself, and some for the prisoner. They 
were all well mounted, with no arms except pistols in 
holsters, and two muskets borne by the soldiers. On the 
last of February, they set out upon their long and peril 
ous journey. Within a quarter of a mile from the point 
of departure, the dreadful massacre at Fort Mimms 
occurred six years after. Pursuing the Indian path, 
which led from the " 'Bigby settlement " to Fort Wilkin 
son, on the Oconee, they reached a point thirty miles dis 
tant the first day. At night, the only tent in the company 
was pitched for the prisoner, who reposed himself upon 
his blankets. The country abounded in immense pine 
forests. Here the Ex-Vice-President lay the first night, 



222 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

before the blazing fire, which threw a glare over the dis 
mal woods. 

To what an extremity had he now been reduced ! In 
the boundless wilds of Alabama, under a small and com 
fortless tent, amid the perils of Indian barbarities, with 
the cry of the panther, answered by the howl of the 
hungry wolf ringing in his ears ; while the moaning of 
the winds through the tops of the lofty trees added 
dreariness to the solitude of the night ; with none with 
whom to hold converse ; surrounded by a guard to whom 
he dared not speak ; a prisoner of the United States, for 
whose liberties he had fought, and whose Government he 
had helped to form ; exiled from the State of his adop 
tion, whose statutes and institutions bore the impress of 
his mind ; deprived by death of his devoted wife ; his 
only child then on a distant coast of Carolina ; his pro 
fessional pursuits abandoned, and his fortune swept away ; 
the magnificent scheme of the conquest of Mexico up 
rooted, and the fragments dispersed; slandered and 
hunted down, from one end of the Union to the other ; 
these were considerations sufficient to weigh down an 
ordinary individual, and sink him to an untimely grave. 
But his was no common mind; and the characteristic 
fortitude and determination which had ever marked his 
course, still sustained him in the darkest hour. In the 
morning, he arose cheerfully, and pursued his course. 
Although guarded with vigilance, his few wants were 
gratified, as far as they could be, and he was treated with 
respect and kindness. The trail being narrow and 
obscure, Burr rode in the middle, having a part of the

guard in front, while the rest followed behind, in single 
file. The route lay about eight miles south of the pres 
ent city of Montgomery, then an Indian town called 
Eaconcharte meaning' Red Ground. 

In the year 1811, General Wade Hampton cut out the 
" Federal Road " along this trail, which was well known 
to early settlers as the only highway in South Alabama. 
The guard passed by the site of the present Mount 
Meigs, and stopped at the house of "Old Milly," the 
former wife of a British soldier, who, with her husband, 
in 1770, left the barracks in Savannah and came to the 
Creek Nation. She had long been a resident of these 
wild woods, now lying in the county of Montgomery. 
Her husband, at this time a colored man, named Evans, 
was employed by Perkins to pilot the party across the 
dangerous creeks, Lime, Dubahatchee and Calabee, all of 
which they had to swim. It was a perilous and fatiguing 
march ; and, for days, the rain descended in chilling tor 
rents on those unsheltered horsemen, collecting in rivulets 
and swimming them at every point. Hundreds of Indians 
thronged the trail, and the party could have been shot 
down ; but the fearless Perkins bore on his distinguished 
prisoner, arnid angry elements and human foes. In their 
journey through Alabama, they always slept in the 
woods, near swamps of reeds, upon which the belled and 
hobbled horses fed during the night. After a hastily- 
prepared breakfast, it was their custom again to remount, 
and march on, in gloomy silence, which was but occa 
sionally broken by a remark about the weather, the 
creeks, or the horses. Burr was a splendid rider, sitting 
firmly in the saddle, and ever on the alert. He was 



224 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

always a hardy traveler, and although wet for hours, 
with cold and drizzling rains, riding forty miles a day, 
and at night stretched upon the bare ground, on a thin 
pallet, yet, in the whole distance to Richmond, he was 
never heard to say that he was sick, or even fatigued. 
At the Chattahoochie, was a crossing-place, owned by an 
Indian named Marshall. The effects of the expedition 
were carried over in canoes, while the horses swam along 
side. In this manner they passed the Flint and Ocmul- 
gee. At Fort Wilkinson, on the Oconee, they entered 
the first ferry-boat they had seen on the whole route. A 
few miles further on, they were sheltered by the first 
civilized roof a house of entertainment, kept by one 
Bevin. While breakfast was preparing, and the guard 
were seated around a large fire, the host, like all publicans 
on the highway, inquired from whence they came. As 
they were from the " 'Bigby settlements," he immediately 
fell on the fruitful theme of the traitor, Aaron Burr. He 
asked if he had been taken ? " Was he not a very bad 
man ? " " Was n't everybody afraid of him ? " Perkins 
and his party were very much annoyed and embarrassed, 
and made no reply. Burr was sitting in a corner by the 
fire, with his head down ; and, after listening to the 
inquisitiveness of Bevin until he could endure it no 
longer, he raised himself up, and, planting his fiery eyes 
upon him, said : 

" I am Aaron Burr ; what is it you want with me ? " 
Bevin, struck with his appearance, the keenness of his 
look, and the solemnity and dignity of his manner, stood 
aghast, and trembled like a leaf. He uttered not another 
word while the guard remained at his house. 



. x 

UNSUCCESSFUL RUSE. 225 

When Perkins readied the confines of South Carolina, 
he watched Burr more closely than ever ; for in this State 
lived the son-in-law of Burr, Col. Alston, a gentleman of 
talents, wealth and influence, and afterward Governor of 
the State. Upon reaching the frontiers of Georgia, he 
endeavored to convey the prisoner in by-roads, to avoid 
the towns, lest he should be rescued. The plan was at 
tended with difficulty ; they were lost often ; the march 
impeded ; and the highway was again resumed. Before 
entering the town of Chester, in South Carolina, the 
party halted. Two men were placed before Burr; two 
on either side, and two behind ; and, in this manner, they 
passed near a tavern on the street, where many persons 
were standing; while music and dancing were heard in 
the house. Burr conceived it a favorable opportunity for 
escape ; and, suddenly dismounting, exclaimed : 

" I am Aaron Burr, under military arrest, and claim 
protection of the civil authorities ! " 

Perkins leaped from his horse, with several of his men, 
and ordered him to remount. 

" / will not ! " replied Burr. 

Not wishing to shoot him, Perkins threw down his 
pistols, and, being a man of prodigious strength, and 
the prisoner a small man, seized him around the waist 
and placed him in his saddle, as though he was a child. 
Thomas Malone caught the reins of the bridle, slipped 
them over the horse's head, and led him rapidly on. The 
astonished citizens had seen a party enter their village 
with a prisoner ; had heard him appeal to them for pro 
tection ; had witnessed the feat of Perkins ; and the 

party vanished, before they had time to recover from 
15 



226 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS 

their confusion ; for, when Burr dismounted, the guards 
cocked their pistols, and the people ran within the piazza 
to escape from danger. 

Burr was still, to some extent, popular in South Caro 
lina ; and any wavering or timidity on the part of Per 
kins would have lost him his prisoner ; but the celerity of 
his movements gave no time for the people to reflect, be 
fore he was far in the outskirts of the village. Here the 
guard halted. Burr was highly excited ; he was in tears ! 
The kind-hearted Malone also wept at seeing the uncon 
trollable despondency of him who hitherto had proven 
almost iron-hearted. It was the first time any one had 
ever seen Aaron Burr unmanned. 

The guard becoming very much alarmed on the subject 
of Burr's rescue, Malone and Henry advised the purchase 
of a carriage. The former took charge of the guard, 
while Perkins returned and purchased a gig. The next 
day, Burr was placed in a vehicle, and driven, without 
further incident, to Fredericksburg, Virginia. Here Per 
kins received dispatches from the President, requiring 
him to convey the prisoner to Richmond. The guard 
took the stage, and soon reached that place. The ladies 
of the city vied with each other in contributing to the 
comfort of Burr. Some sent him fruit ; some clothes ; 
some wine; some one thing; some another. Perkins 
and his men went to "Washington; were paid for their 
services, and returned to Alabama, by way of Tennessee.* 



* The foregoing incidents are taken from Pickett's History of Alabama. 
With but few exceptions, I have followed nearly the exact language of 
the author. 



IMPLICATION. 227 

Col. Alston, finding himself deeply implicated by the 
proclamation of the President, and mortified at the indis 
cretion of Col. Burr, to release himself of the suspicion 
which rested upon him, promptly addressed the following 
communication to his Excellency Charles Pinckney, then 
Governor of South Carolina : 

OAKS, February 6th, 1807. 

DEAR SIR: I have received and read the President's 
Message with deep mortification and concern; but the 
letter annexed to it, stated to be a communication in 
cyphers from Col. Burr to Gen. Wilkinson, excites my 
unfeigned astonishment. I solemnly avow that, when 
that letter was written, I had never heard, directly or 
indirectly, from Col. Burr, or any other person, of the 
meditated attack on New Orleans ; nor had I any more 
reason to suspect an attack on that place, or any other 
part of the United States, than I have* at this moment to 
suspect that our militia will be forthwith ordered on an 
expedition against Gibraltar. On the other hand, I had 
long had strong grounds for believing that Col. Burr was 
engaged by other objects, of a very different nature from 
those attributed to him, and which I confess the best 
sentiments of my heart approved. I need not add that 
those objects involved not the interests of my country. 
Without adverting to that integrity of principle, which 
even my enemies, I trust, have allowed me, can it be sup 
posed that a man situated as I am descended from a 
family which has never known dishonor, happy in the 
affection and esteem of a large number of relations and 
friends, possessed of ample fortune, and standing high in 



228 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the confidence of his fellow-citizens could harbor, for an 
instant, a thought injurious to the country which was the 
scene of those blessings? The supposition would be 
monstrous. No, sir ; it was but a short period before the 
impression became general, that apprehended the possi 
bility of Mr. Burr's intentions being hostile to the Union ; 
and the moment which gave birth to that apprehension, 
gave birth to the resolution which became a citizen. I 
confess, however, there are times even now, when, in 
spite of the strong facts which have been exhibited, I am 
almost inclined to believe my suspicions injurious. What 
ever may be thought of the heart of Mr. Burr, his talents 
are great beyond question, and to reconcile with such 
talents, the chimerical project of dismembering the 
Union, or wresting from it any part of its Territory, is 
difficult indeed. I traveled through a part of the western 
country, during the last summer, and have no hesitation 
in saying, that either of those projects would have been 
as much reprobated there as in the Atlantic States. "With 
respect, however, to the communication annexed to the 
President's Message, which occasions you the trouble of 
this letter : after my solemn assurances to you that I had 
never given Col. Burr, or any other person, the smallest 
reason to imagine that I could be induced to engage in 
any project against my country, it would be infinitely 
satisfactory to me, could I explain to you, with the same 
certainty, the motive which led him to introduce my name 
as he did. But here, unfortunately, all is conjecture. 
Two motives only suggest themselves. He imagined, 
perhaps which, by the way, he has no right to do that 
his influence would be sufficiently great to induce my 



MOTIVE. 229 

assent, and thought, therefore, he might as well consider 
it already obtained ; or, which is more probable, he might 
have imagined, that by the apparent concert of a number 
of persons from different States, a stronger impression would 
be made on his correspondent. Considerable effect, too, was, 
no doubt, anticipated by Mr. Burr's discernment from the 
perfect self-confidence which would have been manifested 
by his taking with him his daughter, receiving my co 
operation, and thus embarking in the scheme the fortunes 
of his infant grandson, the only relative, except his 
daughter, that he has. But whatever the motive w^hich 
drew from Col. Burr the expressions contained in this 
letter to Gen. "Wilkinson, facts, incontrovertible facts, prove 
that he had no authority for making them. His daughter 
did not go with him; the navy of the United States is still 
faithful to its duty ; Commodore Truxton, I am told, at 
the very moment he was said to have gone to the West 
Indies, was in Philadelphia, which I know not whether 
he has ever left ; and I, instead of following with a corps 
of worthies, am now at my usual residence, ivhere I have been 
ever since the adjournment of the Legislature, peaceably 
directing the plowing of my rice-fields, and preparing 
my lands for the ensuing crop. This is conclusive. A 
conspirator against the happiness and liberties of his 
country would have been, at this moment, very different 
ly employed. Conspirator! the blood now burns my 
cheek, as I write the word. But I meant to confine 
myself simply to the disavowal I have made you, of a 
single action or word hostile to my country. To feel 
even that disavowal necessary is sufficiently painful : I 
have yielded, however, to circumstances, and made it. 



230 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

My unequivocal manner of making it, I trust, will not 
leave a doubt upon one candid or honest mind. Still I 
am aware that the common interchange of good offices 
with a man with whom I have been kmg nearly con 
nected, may have given rise to circumstances which, 
however innocent in themselves, malignity will delight 
in distorting, and the illiberal among my political adver 
saries exult in disseminating. I am aware that there will 
be men base enough ; for you and I have, not long since, 
seen proofs of it, to whisper even the circumstance of my 
connection, by marriage, with Col. Burr, as a circum 
stance warranting suspicion. About the opinions of such 
men I am indifferent. To the more ingenious and better 
part of my fellow-citizens, of whatever sect or party, I 
can only solemnly repeat, as I have done to you, sooner 
would I have perished than harbored a thought sub 
versive of the liberties, the happiness, or the integrality of 
my country. Let me always be judged by my own acts, 
and I shall be satisfied. If Mr. Jefferson or Gen. Wil 
kinson ever find any thing to urge against me, let it be 
adduced. My residence is well known, and I shall never 
shrink from investigation. Nay more, presumption, where 
I can not repel it by positive proof, shall be received as 
good evidence, and the slightest suspicion which I can not 
satisfactorily explain, shall be admitted as guilt. 

I remain, my dear sir, with much respect and regard. 
Yours always, JOSEPH ALSTON. 



REDEEMING THE TIME. 231 



CHAPTER XII. 

BLENNERHASSETT having been arrested and discharged 
in the Mississippi Territory, imagined no further annoy 
ance from the Government. Feeling desirous to ascer 
tain the situation of his property at the island, which he 
had learned from his wife and others was much injured 
by the proceedings of the Wood county militia, he left 
^Natchez in June, with the intention of visiting it. 

The following correspondence will advise the reader of 
the incidents of his journey, and afford satisfactory in 
formation, in the mean time, of the situation of the 
respective parties : 

Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

GIBSON'S PORT, SATURDAY, June ~L3th, 1807. 

I arrived here about half-past seven o'clock this morn 
ing, after having lost half the day yesterday by lying by 
at Greenville, with a headache too heavy to ride with. I 
am now perfectly well, and after losing to-day with the 
Belpre* folks here, and the detention occasioned by getting 
little Bay shod, shall resume the journey this evening. 

The road is pretty open, having been lately cut out; 
but I shall endeavor, by traveling a good part of the 
night, to make up for whatever indulgence of shelter or 
rest I may allow the horses and myself in the day. I 



232 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

find the cap the most comfortable luxury I ever traveled 
with, and think I can adjust a simple handkerchief about 
my head and face in a way to parry the musquitoes, or 
their more formidable companions the horse-flies. 

I have no care, I assure you, for any thing affecting 
myself, but through you and my boys ; could I, then, only 
be assured, that you would be as industrious to seek your 
recreation, and frequently shift the subject of your labors, 
as you are criminal in protracting the intervals of your 
sedentary occupations, that my boys would not be ever 
exposed to the sun bareheaded and barefoot, my reflec 
tions on my business, or subjects of interest or amuse 
ment would not, I protest, suffer a moment's interruption. 
Improve, then, the blessing you did not expect, for you 
could never find it on the Ohio, which a benignant God 
has reserved for you among strangers, in the generous 
regards of so many worthy families and individuals who 
have become your friends. Farewell ! 

HAR. BLENNERHASSETT. 

Give my particular love to Scott and F , and kiss 

Anne and the boys for me. 

MRS. BLENNERHASSETT. 



Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

TOCKSHISH, IN THE CHICKASAW CATION, 

(310 miles from Natchez^ June 14*A, 1807. 
I rest here to-day under the most severe embarrass 
ments I have suffered since I left you ; namely, the state 
of my tormented legs. The respite, however, is not less 
necessary for my horses, which have hitherto performed 



TRAVEL'S HISTORY. 233 

very well. I mention the condition of my legs the more 
freely, "because I know you will not disregard such an 
affliction. But whether from the heat of the weather, 
meager, and often scanty meals, the state of my blood 
has contracted an acrimonious habit it never had before, 
? t is certain the myriads of musquitoes and horse-flies, 
with the almost incessant perspiration that I suffered for 
five days after I left you, which allowed me no repose, 
until exhaustion made me callous, and sleep now in my 
cot, then on the ground, prepared a revival of fresh sensi 
bility to new sufferings, all, I can aver, were not more 
intolerable than the anguish of my legs, which the ardor 
of my industry to prosecute my journey would not until 
now permit me to find ease, even when at rest ; no doubt, 
chiefly from so much pendent motion on horseback. But 
to that benignant Providence, which has so often had mer 
cy upon me, be rendered all gratitude and thanksgiving. 
I shall make good my journey, as I can convert my eye 
into a microscope, by which I am enabled, through Di 
vine goodness, to make this pen write to you. Through 
the same favor I shall pass unhurt through all the diffi 
culties and dangers I may yet encounter, and I will again 
embrace you and our boys, or we shall be indemnified 
hereafter. 

I omit to detail, at present, particulars of the journey 
hitherto. It is true, women and children perform it, for 
women will attempt and perform any possible undertak 
ing, and they will not leave their teams behind ; but it is 
no less certain, that many of them languish on the way ; 
and the hardiest boatmen, and even Joe, who behaves 
admirably, swear they will never again attempt it at this 



234 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

season of the year. We are now, by estimation, about 
215 miles from Nashville, of which distance there is about 
fifty miles yet to pass through this Nation. We shall 
take from this place a fresh supply of corn for our .horses, 
and a recruit to our remaining provisions, of two quarts 
of parched meal. You will see by the map, we shall 
then, when we cross Duck river, enter Tennessee, where 
we shall want for nothing. Water has been tolerably 
convenient and palatable so far ; henceforward, I am 
told, it will be very good and plenty. I have had no 
scruple in drinking heartily while contending with heat, 
horse-flies, smoke and musquitoes. How fondly have I 
wished for the solacing society of Harding and Russel. 

! how I could walk then. 

The Chocataw country, for an extent of 250 miles which 

1 have passed through, has not been altogether uninter 
esting, either from the condition of the natives, who are 
beginning, at least in the vicinity of this path, to enter 
somewhat into the pastoral state, and in some solitary 
instances, from the example of about one hundred white 
men, settled through their Nation, exhibit some com 
mencements of agriculture, or from the appearance of 
their country, nine-tenths of whicli consist of either 
prairies or timber lands, well stocked with a variety of 
fine grass and plants, which exhibit a pleasing appearance 
from the total freedom from brush and underwood, 
which disfigure all the forests you have seen in America. 
But the Chickasaw lands, for twenty miles back we have 
traveled since we entered the Nation, deserve, in every 
point of view, the character of a Paradise, so far as any 
inland countrv, without the features of water scenery in 



BISSEL'S IMPEACHMENT. 235 

its landscape, can claim it. Besides the beauty and 
variety of the whole vegetable clothing of the country, 
the clearly undulating surface of its woods, and the more 
advanced progress of the Chickasaws in agriculture, and 
the domestic economy that provides for the comforts of 
life, contrasted, as it is, with a tenacity of most of their In 
dian habits and manners, form altogether a variety truly 
interesting. This people must, in less than fifty years, 
become as respectable, in the " shepherd state," as they 
have hitherto been in the characters of the best warriors 
of all the tribes south of the Ohio. They have already 
no hunting ground nearer to them than the Mississippi, 
100 miles distant. This circumstance will insure it. 

I have heard, by the way, pretty consistently, that Bis- 
sel is impeached, and will probably suffer for his civilities 
to Col. Burr. Jackson is sent down to the Heights, or 
Orleans, to be tried on a multitude of charges, and Ser 
geant D is taken round by Wilkinson to testify to 

God knows what. 

When you write, as you will, I trust, every week until 
first of November, be careful to set down nothing that 
may not meet the public eye ; and I think it safest to 
inclose to me, under cover to Gen. Tupper. I trust you 
will soon accustom yourself to the free enjoyment of all 
the hospitable kindness and attention that will be tend 
ered to you from Natchez to Bayou Sara : this is one of 
my best hopes, as I fear not we shall be able to find 
opportunities hereafter to requite the goodness of bur 
friends. As I constantly meditate on the prospect of 
your satisfaction with them, they all pass in review of 
my most grateful remembrance. During such moments, 



236 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

however, my thoughts seem to soar on the wings of fancy, 
to a hight at which I lose sight of all other mortals, 
except the Scotts ; while at other intervals of my reflec 
tions, I seem to gravitate, like falling bodies through the 
air, to Harding, as the immovable center of your comfort 
and protection during my absence. I hope you got my 

first letter from Gibson's Port, and my second from C , 

100 miles back. I have only time to say again, God 
bless you and the boys ! The post hurries me. 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

I shall resume the journey before day, to-morrow, 7 
o'clock P. M. 



From Mrs. to Mr. Blennerhassett. 

July 6th. 

I received your letter from the Nation, also the one 
previous to it, but derived but little pleasure from the 
general tenor of the last. Its contents are too gloomy, 
and I wanted no addition to the causes of low spirits I 
have experienced ever since you left ; for these, however, 
I know I am to blame. I trust you are in good health. 
Our dear, fine boys are almost the only children here who 
keep well, and grow fat. 

While I find my society more than ever courted, there 
is, and will be till you return, an insurmountable barrier 
to my peace of mind, in the fear of your becoming in 
volved in private quarrels. If they can, with honor, be 
avoided, I trust and pray they will. 

I see no reason for any despondency whatever. We 
can undoubtedly make a good beginning here, and, from 



TREATMENT. 237 

what I have experienced since your departure, I am per 
fectly satisfied that this climate, in summer as well as 
winter, is every way more desirable than the one I left 
on the Ohio, so that, please God ! our happiness is now 
more in our own keeping than ever before. I trust your 
limbs are already well; if not, I wish you to try the 
leaves of the Jamestown weed. You need only take two 
or three of them, and, after softening them a little by 
beating between the palms of your hands, bind them well 
on the sores, after having first washed them with sugar 
of lead. Repeat the dressing three times, and then apply 
salve made of sugar of lead. 

I hope you will be able to procure all the things men 
tioned on your list. If you can, I want you. to get some 
of the early cucumber that the Barnes's used to have up 
the Kanawha, and bring every rare-ripe peach tree which 
can be moved out of the garden, as I find that sort are 
not grown in this country. If Peter Taylor, the gardener 
of Blennerhassett, comes, he must bring every flowering 
shrub he can move, or you find room for. 

I left a pair of wafer (not waffle) irons in the kitchen, 
which I wish to have again, if possible. Should it be 
convenient to send my side-saddle, by safe hands, before 
you come yourself, I hope you will do so, as, perhaps, I 
may need it, though I have, at present, more carriages at 
my service than I can possibly use. I trust, however, 
this state of dependence may be removed by your bring 
ing me some sort of a vehicle on your return. 

In my next I shall give you a full account of the way 
in which I have spent my time since you left me : mean 
while, you can hardly calculate the attentions I receive 



238 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

from every one ; but Harding and the Scotts will ever be 
foremost in real affection. Ruple, I fancy, is on his way 
up, as is also Captain Leonard. 

I have some prospect of exchanging houses with Cap 
tain Yoss. He went two days since in pursuit of Peter 
Dexter for that purpose, and has not yet returned. Mr. 

H will manage the business for me, and when I have 

completed moving, I shall take leave of town, for two or 
three weeks, for Second Creek, accompanied by Miss 
Percy, who has not yet been able to join me, but makes 
fair promises. Should she fail, Mrs. Whittle will go 
with me. 

I have had a most pressing invitation from Mr. and 
Mrs. Borlin, and am expected to visit them when I go 
down : she is a charming little woman. Mr. Hunt has 
not yet returned, but is expected daily. I have hired 
Diana out. Molly and her Spaniard do every thing for 
me ; she is very good, and he the most obliging creature 
in the world. He stays here a great deal, goes to market, 
gets wood, and is said to be a very honest man. 

An aid to General Wilkinson met you near the Nation, 
and said you were well. He also circulated a report, and 
even told Scott, that it was now discovered that Jefferson 
was concerned with Burr, and had even given him his 
cypher. Harman says I must say they are good boys; 
but Dominick* replies, that would be a falsehood. I 
send you their ugly faces. Remember me with affection 
to the Belpr^ folks. God bless you ! farewell till next 

week !

ARRIVAL. 239 

P. S. I find I must inclose this in a wrapper (envelope), 
as I am too lazy to copy it, and am hourly expecting com 
pany to call. Tell Peter Taylor, if he should not like to 
stay with us, he can, by supplying the Natchez market, 
very soon make a handsome independence for his family ; 
but he had better leave them where they are for the 
present, as they will be much healthier, and he can main 
tain them there for almost nothing compared to the cost 
of living here ; besides, when he deems it prudent, he 
can have them brought down at almost any time. Say to 
Amy that the boys speak every day of her children, and 
that none of them shall have reason to repent coming to 
this country. 



Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

NASHVILLE, June 29th, 1807, past 5 P. M. 

I arrived here about one o'clock this day, being the 
eighteenth since I left you, including about three and a 
half days, during which I lay by ; namely, at Greenville 
and Gibson's Port, nearly one and a half days ; one at 
Tockshish, in the Chickasaw Nation, from whence I 
wrote to you, as I did from Gibson's Port ; and one more 
a little within the entrance of this state, fifty-three miles 
back, occasioned by the state of the horses, all of which 
had completely given out with fatigue and sore backs. 
It required much address to get here, even when we did ; 
and here we are to remain, for five days at least, to get 
the horses and my legs in a condition to proceed, and 
perform the remainder of the journey. 

My entrance into the United States has not been very 



240 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

auspicious. Last Friday evening, soon after I had passed 
what is called the line that separates Tennessee from the 
"Wilderness, I endured, for upwards of an hour, the heavi 
est fall of rain I was ever under ; indeed, none ever fell 
heavier. Packing through mud in the pathway, covered 
with six miles of running water all along, part of the 
time in the dark, I was still, however, able to keep my 
self perfectly dry, by passing my head through a hole in 
the middle of my blanket, which hung on my shoulders 
and covered me every-where, a contrivance I supposed 
myself indebted for to the care Hardings' servants have 
had of my great coat. The next mishap was my last de 
tention, fifty-three miles back. The next was meeting a 
man yesterday morning, about forty-five miles back, who 
looked strongly at me, and passing by to a man who was 
traveling in company with me, inquired of him my name ; 
then said he had a letter for me, but would not deliver it, 
as it lay, he said, in the bottom of his saddle-bags. Had 
Joe or I learned this before we had traveled too far to 
turn back, we should certainly have had the letter, one 
way or another. You will get it, I hope, and forward it, 
with any others you receive for me, with all possible dis 
patch. 

Journeying on hither, I was much mortified, as I 
stopped to breakfast yesterday, by the perusal in a paper 
of the first proceedings at Richmond against Col. Burr, 
which evince the most rancorous malice of the Govern 
ment against his life. But they will be disappointed by 
the negative and cautious conduct he has all along pur 
sued. In the course of the proceedings it appears Jefier- 
son's runners have been industrious enough to ferret out 



A DREAM. 241 

Peter Taylor and Jacob Albright, to prove that there was 
a body of armed men assembled on Blennerhassett's 
Island. This may surprise you, but it matters not. I 
need not write to you the particulars I have further seen ; 
they will reach you by the papers sooner then through me. 
Some short time before day this morning, my next tor 
ment was a dream, where I slept last night, ten miles 
back, in which I beheld our Harman fallen a victim to 
the bite of a dog, and you an insane mourner, wan and 
sallow, without a tear. You know I am sincere in deny 
ing all virtue to dreams, either as cause or effect of human 
events. I therefore mention this, with every confidence 
in God's mercy, that he will permit you to tell me our 
darling boy has continued well, long after the period of 
my dream. But the manner in which you there appeared 
to me has all day long so haunted me, that I wished, soon 
after I got my valise taken to my room, to chase away 
such a phantom with a view of the little Mammy, when, 
alas ! my yet last and greatest misfortune was visited 
upon me the treasure, the greatest, after yourself and 
the boys, I could have in this world, for if I do not 
recover it it is irreparable how shall I mention it? I 
lost your second self. Joe sets out twenty miles back 
ward, to-morrow early, in quest of it, where we have 
some hopes of recovering it. ! had Mrs. Alston, by 
one of the best impulses that ever actuated her, had she 
purloined it, how consoling would be the prospect of my 
journey, it would animate me to visit it. How, my love, 
will you soothe this heaviest of my sorrows? I have 
complained to you of none until this overtook me. May 

this be the last letter vou will receive from me in such a 
16 



242 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

state of mind as I now suffer under ; may I be blest with 
the recovery of that talisman that I now so fully feel 
would never fail to keep my strength from falling, and 
my hopes from becoming forlorn in the midst of all I 
may suffer from the malice of my enemies captivity or 
death. Perhaps it is reserved for me to recover this sol 
ace of every trouble that I shall endure, until I again em 
brace you. 

So far I had written yesterday. You will feel with 
what weight at my heart, though I knew before I sat 
down this letter will not leave this before Friday. To 
day, Tuesday, I have been chiefly occupied since I got 
Joe off on the greatest service, if successful, he can ever 
render me with further perusals of the proceedings at 
Richmond, up to the 6th instant, when Wilkinson had 
not arrived, though hourly expected, as it was supposed 
he must have set out three weeks sooner from Orleans 
than he did. I hope your friends, Harding and Scott, 
will get you the fullest accounts of the trial, from time to 
time. Nothing can hardly interest you more.- You may 
read some things that may alarm you for A. B. or H. B. ; 
but I have no doubt the rancor of Government will be 
baffled in its purpose to fasten any treason upon us, or 
even a misdemeanor. 

This place appears very dull and ugly, but tolerably 
cheap. The inhabitants are chiefly the offcastings of 
North Carolina, and I do not know a single face I have 
yet seen. The living, of course, at this inn, is rough and 
uncomfortable, except the tea and coffee, which will 
redeem many sins of the table with me. But the attend 
ance is very bad every- where, and criminal, where I want

it most, in the stables, at a time when I can not walk. 
On this view of my situation, I have thoughts of moving 
six or eight miles onward to-morrow, there to wait for 
whatever Thursday's post may bring here for me ; 'and 
endeavor to get the poor horses on, by easy journeys, as 
well as we can. It is now almost nightfall. I look for 
and dread Joe's return every hour to-night. You see, 
however, I am lighter at heart than I was yesterday ; and 
is not this a crime in my situation, yet no-way mended ? 
I had not light to finish the last sentence of Tuesday 
evening, when Beaumont, the pilot, who took me over 
the Falls in one of Floyd's boats, called upon me to in 
quire after him, and told me Mrs. F. had paid the debt 
of nature, about the middle of this month, having left 
behind her a fine child. It is painful, but necessary, that 
we should be the messengers of these sad tidings, if they 
have not otherwise reached him, because his affairs at 
home require his speedy return, his property of every sort 
depending only on the care of a negro wench. 

Yesterday, I spent the whole day in perplexing anxiety 
for Joe's absence, and the care of my unfortunate legs, 
on which it is not only misery to walk, but even to put 
them on the ground for a moment. They also prevent 
my rest a considerable part of the night. Nothing seems 
to succeed but close bandaging from the toe to the knee, 
which I have again resorted to. Up to this moment, "Wed 
nesday noon, July 2d, we have no intelligence of the thief 
who, we doubt not, stole my treasure. I have more than 
one runner out after him ; have offered ten dollars, and 
would not depart hence, if myself and horses were able, 
till all chance was hopeless. Joe has returned, after a 



244 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

fruitless and unremitting search for him of forty hours. I 
hope Russell has returned, and is received as he deserves. 

Assure Kitty I cordially wish her no worse a husband 
than would write to her, and feel for her, after thirteen 
years' trial, as I do for you. I depend upon his vaccinating 
Harman, and attending you all three, if necessary. The 
state of your chest, I rely on your solemn promise to me, 
has surely been submitted to him, and I hope he has lost 
no time to administer every palliative and preventive he 
could best imagine. My concern for your keeping the 
boys' heads and feet always covered, I can never cease to 
dwell upon and repeat. 

I must leave you for some sort of dinner. God grant 
I may be able to add one more pleasing line than any I 

have yet written, before the mail closes this evening. 

Well, "par hazard," I have made a better dinner than 
any I have had yet in this place, i. e., the first bit of 
wheaten bread I could eat, and one cut of good mutton, 
well roasted. But does this ennui afflict a man who was 
satisfied and cheerful, after forty -five miles' ride, with half 
a tin-cup of water-gruel twice a day, in an Indian wilder 
ness ? Have I only returned into what is called civilized so 
ciety, to wish myself out of it? Much have I projected to 
execute of that active exertion which Harding so kindly 
urged me to. But I am now a cripple, without a leg to 
stand upon, or a mind capable of emerging from that sea 
of trouble in which it has sunk so deeply. I shall, how 
ever, wait the news next Monday's mail may bring from 
the eastward. It is not impossible some tidings may 
arrive to determine me hence westward, even direct to 
the chance of an asylum, under the government of Grand 



PROMISE. 245 

PrS ; for I have little doubt Jefferson-, if he can not 
effect our ruin by our conviction, will seek it by harrass- 
ing us to beggary. I think if I should oe prosecuted 
with the virulence that has marked the proceedings 
against Burr, my acquittal, by the trouble and expense 
that would be incurred to obtain it, would be worth little 
more than a condemnation. One thing is certain, I shall 
take nothing from you to fee lawyers. I shall have none 
that may not volunteer their assistance. So you will 
have another short letter from this place, or its neighbor 
hood, to announce to you upon what terms, and in what 
temper, I leave it: my anxiety augments largely for fre 
quent and long letters from you. 

I trust you have long since left the Chateau of Poin- 
dexter, and have previously made every necessary ar 
rangement for a regular intercourse with -the Post-office 
at Natchez. I hourly expect Col. Panil, whom I over 
took and passed by 150 miles back, without seeing him. 
I wish he was come to break in upon my ennui. I have 
nothing to comfort me but this last refuge hope. All 
this tumult of my heated head has it been kindled by 
you, or a trinket ? God bless you all three, and all our 
good friends. The mail is near closing. Adieu.

Blennerhassett to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

NASHVILLE, Sunday, July 6th, 1807. 
As I am very anxious to leave this to-morrow evening, 
after I shall peruse whatever I may find interesting by 
the mail, which may occupy me the best part of the day, 



246 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

I now use that time it might cost me to-morrow to tell 
you my legs are now nearly quite well, which I am in 
debted for, to a week's rest, and the most careful skill I 
possess. Col. Panil arrived here on Friday evening, 
much improved in his looks by his long journey, in which 
he did not distress himself by hard riding, whatever he 
might otherwise have suffered from insects and hot 
weather. He eats like a dray-horse, and can not find a 
single complaint, in the catalogue of all human, bodily 
infirmities to appropriate to himself. There is one there, 
however, which, though he will not see it, or utter its 
name, has fastened pretty hard upon him. Hypochon 
dria has marked him for her own, and he will sink under 
her, unless he abandons his plantation near Natchez. I 
have been so far particular, that you may, if you have an 
opportunity, convey to his family a more unbiassed 
sketch of his situation, than they will probably receive 
from himself. 

By a private arrival here to-day, I collect, by calcula 
tion on the intelligence by way of Knoxville, Wilkinson 
had arrived at Richmond, but did not probably get there 
before the 17th or 18th ultimo. It is most likely the 
grand jury has been detained to the period of his arrival. 
I hope to-morrow's papers will afford more satisfaction. 
Have you really missed writing to me by two mails that 
have left Natchez since I came away, without your hav 
ing been prevented by something you could not obviate. 
Judge of my mortification to see Col. Panil read letters 
from home of 23d, while I was looking over Natchez 
papers of the same date^, after I had left you on the llth. 
Tt will give me five days' work to get to Lexington, say 



LAST REFUGE. 247 

200 miles, with horses in the condition of mine ; and, as 
I shall endeavor not to delay there longer than two days 
to rest the horses, I fear I have little chance of hearing 
from you before I reach Marietta ; so little have you 
cared, or so unhappily have you been forbidden to use 
the time which is past. You will surely need no further 
hints of this sort. I hope you have not suffered the 
idolatrous grief, with which I filled my last letter, to 
affect you much. It was a weakness in me to pour the 
melancholy effusions of my heart into your breast ; but 
how could I resist so natural a remedy for my pain ? 
While I possessed your image, I did not feel how really I 
was an idolater. When my hard fortune deprived me of 
it, I could see nothing in the loss so lively as the image 
of your death. Hence, hope, my last refuge, led me to 
dwell upon yourself; besides, I thought you could not be 
afflicted by my misfortune as I am. Joe, and others, are 
out still, and yesterday I again advertised in the paper, 
and am not absolutely in the abandonment of despair to 
recover my treasure. I already feel, however, time will 
wear out the impression of this calamity, as it effaces all 
others. So far in my fifth letter, which I will continue 
to-morrow. 

The mail arrived late this morning, Monday, 7th, and 
brings no Richmond papers. I have seen, however, a 
Virginia paper of the 12th ultimo, by which it appears 
that Burr had applied to the court for a " subpena duces 
tecum" directed to the President, requiring him to appear 
as a witness, and bring along with him a letter, he stated 
in one of his messages to Congress to have received from 



248 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Wilkinson, which letter has not yet been made public. 
The chief justice doubted of the power of the court to 
order the personal attendance of the President, and fixed 
upon the next day to have his mind made up, by an argu 
ment on the motion. 

It has rained so hard, by frequent and heavy showers 
all day, that I should not have set out at any rate. To 
morrow I shall be accompanied by a Doctor Floyd, the 
husband of the ci-devant Miss Preston. We shall be 
together better than half the way, when he will strike 
oft* to Louisville. Since writing the above, I have seen 
some lengthy articles of further proceedings at Richmond, 
which you may first learn, and inform Harding, etc., that 
Burr's motion has been granted, after great and splendid 
exertions by himself and his counsel, particularly Edmond 
Randolph, and that the celebrated original cypher letter 
is not forthcoming, having been said to be lost ; that 
Randolph (Edmond) said in court, " Wilkinson, in a few 
weeks, would be in the rank of a private citizen ; " and 
that from private letters received here, it is believed, that 
immediately after the trial, he will have to settle his pri 
vate accounts with Gen. Jackson, and four or five other 
persons. I have also seen a detailed account of the object 
and issue of a Mr. Burling's mission to Mexico, by 
which it appears he was chiefly sent to insure the balance 
of $300,000, of which Wilkinson had before received 
$120,000, transported from St. Antoine to his quarters on 
mules, in the night. On the whole, Mr. Jefferson and 
his party must be ruined, by the support they have 
afforded Wilkinson, even if it were possible Burr could 



PROPERTY ATTACHED. 249 

be convicted of any thing. Farewell, my love ! if I do 
not write again on the road, I shall immediately on reach 
ing Lexington. 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 
Monday, 12 at night. 



RICHMOND, June 8th, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : Your favor of February last was received 
by me a few days before I left Marietta for Richmond. 
I most sincerely regret that a service of foreign attach 
ment, of the 20th of February, has placed such of your 
property as was under my control out of my power. The 
writ was served on account of Miller, of Kentucky ; and 
Sanders, of Kentucky, has since filed in a claim. A writ 
of foreign attachment has also been served on D. Wood- 
bridge, Esq., attaching the claims you had upon him ; 
and all your movable property at the "Island" is at 
tached. A certificate from the sheriff follows, by which 
you will perceive that property of every description in 
my hands was attached : 

. " I do hereby certify, that on the 20th day of February, 
1807, I served a writ of foreign attachment on D. Wood- 
bridge, as garnishee of H. Blennerhassett, attaching all 
the lands, tenements, goods, rights and credits, moneys 
and effects, which the said Blennerhassett might have in 
his, the said Woodbridge's hands, or possession. 

" JOHN CLARK, Sheriff. 

" County of Washington, State of Ohio." 

The inclosed letters, with one which I shall lodge in 



250 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

the Post-office at the same time with this, I took the lib 
erty of opening in February, just as I was going over the 
mountains, thinking they might require some attention 
and answers. I should have sent them to you long since, 
but did not know where to direct them. You will receive 
here, with your account, a letter from Col. Gushing, which 
makes a different package, but will be put in the office at 
the same time. I expected to have seen you at this place. 
The report in our country was, that you were arrested, 
and were to have your trial at Richmond. I should think 
it much better for your interest, if you do not return to 
the Island, to have an attorney vested with full powers, 
to attend to your business in Marietta and Virginia. 
Your property has, and will continue to suffer very much, 
unless you have a person authorized to attend to it. You 
probably heard from Col. Gushing, that your negroes had 
left Virginia, and were strolling about on our side of the 
river ; that Barker, in consequence of a letter of yours, 
of the 9th December, had recovered about $400 for the 
work done on four unfinished boats, although he had 
offered before to take from me $200, which circumstance 
was known to James Wilson ; that the Neals and Phelps 
had recovered a considerable sum against you, to satisfy 
which demands, Ransom, and a greater part of your mov 
able property on the Island, was sold. I can not give 
you any particulars relating to these transactions, as I 
was over the mountains from February until May, and 
the day I arrived at home was subpoenaed to attend Col. 
Burr's trial, at this place. Buell has gone on, under the 
direction of the Government, to sell such a part of the 
pork, meal, etc., etc., as he attached, and the boats are

fitting up to take the United States' troops to St. Louis. 
"Wishing yourself and family much happiness, I am, 
Your obedient servant, D. WOODBRIDGE. 



Mrs. Blennerhassett to Blennerhassett. 

I can scarcely express the joy communicated to me by 
your last letter from Nashville. Thank God, the anxiety 
of your mind is somewhat relieved. I have little doubt 
that Col. Pannil's hypochondria did you more service 
than even a cheerful companion could have done. What 
a misfortune, in your state of mind, not to have got the 
letter which Mr. Tyrrel, of this place, passed you with 
in his saddle-bags. I now inclose it, and hope by this 
time the attachments may be in a fair way to be taken 
off our poor property. I inclose every other letter I have 
received, except one from D. Wbodbridge and one from 
Col. Gushing, as I trust, long before this reaches you, 
you will have seen them both. I feel greatly for the im 
pression which must be made on you by the present state 
of the Island ; but think, my dear husband, how thankful 
we may be to have preserved the health of our dear boys, 
and also yours, during such a dreadful journey. 

Col. Burr has every thing in his favor, and I now think 
will never let us sustain any eventual injury. You can't 
think with what joy and pride I read what he says of his 
daughter. I never could love one of my own sex as I do 
her : how can she live with such a man as Alston? You 
see he has not had humanity, or even politeness enough, 



252 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to answer your letter. I did not write the mail after 
your departure, and the week following. Thought the 
surest way for my letter to reach you would be to write 
to Lexington. I wish I had calculated better, but trust 
your uneasiness is long since removed. After I wrote 
last week, I went to spend some time with the Scott's ; 
but after leaving town, I learned of the arrival of a 
French Consul, who wished to rent my house. Mrs. 
Whittle to whom I am under the greatest obligations 
was confined with a pleurisy. I was therefore under the 

necessity of spending a day at with her, and took 

that opportunity of engaging half of James Moon's 
house, on the condition that if he had an offer for the 
whole, he was to give me the refusal. Mrs. Whittle keeps 
possession of the other half, where she will reside a good 
deal when recovered, which I hope will be soon, as she 
was much better yesterday, which I spent with her. "We 
are to go together to Second Creek, where I have press 
ing invitations from Berling's family to visit, but I am in 
doubt whether I ought to go there ; I will consult my 
valuable friend and adviser on all occasions. Poor man ! 
he has much anxiety about Winthrop, who has constant 
returns of pleurisy, and as he is cutting two back teeth, 
we are in hopes they are the cause of his illness. My 
visit to Scott's, you see, was curtailed, as I went out on 
Monday evening, and returned on Thursday, when I saw 
the gentleman whose name I do n't yet know ; referred 
him to Harding, saying my rent would be the same I paid 
myself, and he might have the place for the continuance 
of my lease. I then went home ; about the middle of the 



REMOVAL. 253 

day, Thursday, had all my things packed up, and many 
of them removed that evening. The rest I had here, and 
next morning took possession of my new habitation, 
which was in such disorder that it took me two days, 
with the assistance of Molly and her hushand, to settle 
myself, so that altogether I underwent much fatigue; 
but, thanks to my constitution, I am recovering from a 
bad cold, received from exposure when heated, and pains 
in all my limbs, occasioned by my violent exertions, and 
being too tired to sleep for three nights ; but yesterday I 
rested well with Mrs. Whittle, and last night slept sound 
ly. I have this day put Dominick to a most excellent 
school in town, in a healthy, airy place. Thanking God 
for every thing, our situation is a Paradise to the one we 
left ; you will soon feel the benefits of it; 't is impossible 
here to feel heat at any hour of the day, and I have every 
convenience around me, but still I miss the Island. 

Harman says, "tell 'Pappy' I am a very good boy." 
Dominick has just returned from school to dinner. He 
bids me tell you how he loves you; he has come home 
quite pleased, though Mr. Harding and I left him crying 
at school. The schoolmaster's name is Graham, and it 
seems he had taken it into his head, " it was, as he said, 
that Graham who was bad to Col. Burr and us." You 
must 'know, I have lately learned from Col. Scott that 
Graham actually proposed to him to invite Col. Burr to 
his plantation, and when there, under the shelter, as it 
might be supposed, of his honor and hospitality, to pro 
cure good horses, and kidnap him off to the Federal city. 
Col. Scott made answer/ that he already had done his 



254 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

duty, under the command of "Wilkinson, by going to 
Cole's Creek, and would do nothing more. He, Scott, 
was rather intoxicated when he told me this. God bless 
you ! M. BLENNERHASSETT.

Burr to Blennerhassett. 

RICHMOND, May 21st, 1807. 
H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. : 

I have barely time, by the opportunity of Mr. Tyrrell, 
to assure you and Mrs. Blennerhassett of my devoted 
attachment and regard, and to express my sympathy for 
all the vexations you have encountered. Mr. Tyrrell will 
tell you of all the strange things which are passing here. 
Of the bills, the first which you indorsed has been paid 
by Mr. Alston. The $10,000 indorsed at Lexington are 
in the hands of an agent with whom I am in negociation 
at this place. That which was left with Mr. Luckett has 
not, to my knowledge, been negociated. Within a few 
months after my release from this place, I may hope to 
be in cash for all these and some other purposes. 

May God preserve you and yours in health and spirits. 

A. BURR. 

If you should not go on the Washita lands, would you 
like a conveyance of the quantity promised to you. Tell 
Mrs. B. that the one-half of every letter I receive from 
my daughter is concerning her. Affectionate regards 
and grateful acknowledgments to our learned and amiable 
friend Harding. 



ERRONEOUS JUDGMENT. 255 

Alston to Blennerhassett. 

OAKS, June 22d, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : You perceive, from the very first word I 
have written, that I address you with the same feelings 
with which we parted. There are certain expressions in 
your letter of April last, which, if you recollect, you must 
acknowledge, are not calculated to conciliate : they spring, 
however, so manifestly from a zealous attachment to Col. 
Burr, and a misapprehension of my feelings, that they 
have produced none of those sensations which, under 
different circumstances, they would not fail to excite. I 
pass them over, too, the more readily, as I am persuaded 
from your temper, the moment of discovering your error 
will be the moment of regret at having indulged it. 
Suffer me then to assure you, I have inflicted none of 
those wounds upon my " friends or relatives " which you 
apprehend. Col. Burr feels that he has not the smallest 
grounds of resentment against me ; he is perfectly satis 
fied ; nor does there exist a shadow of that animosity 
between us that you deprecate. The fact is, from not 
having a view of the whole ground, you have judged 
precipitately and erroneously of my error, in giving faith 
to the letter attributed to Col. Burr by Gen. Wilkinson, 
I have long been satisfied from several quarters. Noth 
ing but the shape, apparently so unquestionable, in which 
it came, could have gained it credit with me, for a mo 
ment. These things, however, will shortly be put to 
rights. As soon as the trial, now pending at Richmond, 
is over, the event of which, I am persuaded, can not but 
be favorable, Col. Burr will be with us. A letter from 



256 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

him, of the 12th instant, announces health, spirits and 
confidence. Your letter was received the beginning of 
the present month, and, but for the necessity of ascertain 
ing the intentions of Col. Burr upon the subject of it, 
should have been acknowledged immediately. I for 
warded it to him directly, and have just heard from him. 
He informs me that the bill-holders have instituted no 
suit against you, but are at present expecting payment 
from him; that he has hopes of shortly effecting an 
arrangement by which he shall be able to meet the bills 
himself, which will, of course, relieve you, and render a 
reference to me unnecessary. He adds, that a gentleman, 
as agent for him, was to set out in a few days for the 
western country, through whom you should hear further 
and more amply upon the subject. These expectations 
of Col. B., I trust, will be accomplished. I have this day 
written to him, making certain offers which, I hope, will 
facilitate them ; but should they unfortunately fail, I shall 
certainly consider myself bound, both in honor and 
justice, to fulfill my engagement to you. The total 
failure of my crop, caused by the storm of last fall, has 
occasioned me a temporary embarrassment; but should 
your reimbursement devolve upon me, I shall cheerfully 
make any arrangement for a settlement which may prove 
satisfactory : the troubles and vexations you have under 
gone, the dreadful solicitudes and painful situation, so 
long endured by your amiable family, have my liveliest 
sympathies. The energy of mind, which distinguishes 
Mrs. Blennerhassett, has had a painfully ample field for 
exertion ; but the storm is past, and better moments, I 
trust, are about to arrive. Of the friendly attentions and 



INDISPOSITION. 257 

unremitting hospitalities received from you during our 
tour through the western country, allow me to assure you 
of my grateful recollections. Were it within the scope 
of probabilities, I need not tell you how much pleasure 
the presence of yourself and family, at the Oaks, would 
give us. Tender, I pray you, to Mrs. Blennerhassett, my 
profound and most friendly respects. 

Believe me, with much esteem, your very obedient, 

JOSEPH ALSTON. 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 

P. S. Being unwell myself, Mrs. Alston has acted as 
my amanuensis. It is so customary at this time to pub 
lish extracts from every letter in which the name of Col. 
Burr happens to be mentioned, that I was about to 
observe to you, what you will readily perceive without 
the observation, that this is not meant for the same pur 
pose, but merely for your own perusal. 

J. A. 

Having acted as amanuensis for Mr. Alston, I now beg 
leave to speak for myself, and inquire after the health of 
Mrs. Blennerhassett ; her fortitude has, I hope, supported 
her through the troubles of the winter. May they be 
the last she has ever to encounter. I wrote to her last 
autumn, but I suppose my letter has not reached her. 
The fulfillment of our mutual promise of corresponding 
would afford me great pleasure ; for it will now be the 
only means of supporting a friendship, which I flatter 
myself commenced in conformity of sentiment and sin 
cerity ; but whatever may be the length of our separation 
or discontinuance of intercourse, the happy days I spent 
17

on the Ohio, and the character of Mrs. B., will remain 
indelibly impressed on the mind of her friend and 
admirer. T. B. ALSTON.* 



* One individual alone clung to Burr in his hour of trial ; need we say 
that it was a woman, the only daughter of the accused. 

If there is a redeeming feature in the character of Burr, it is to be found 
in his love for that child. From her earliest years, he had educated her 
with a care to which we look in vain for a parallel among his contempo 
raries. She grew up, in consequence, no ordinary woman. Beautiful 
beyond most of her sex ; accomplished as few females of that day were 
accomplished, she displayed to her family and friends a fervor of affection 
which not every woman is capable of; the character of Theodosia Burr 
has long been regarded almost as we would regard that of a heroine of 
romance. Her love for her father partook of the purity of a better world ; 
holy, deep, unchanging ; it reminds us of the affection which a celestial 
spirit might be supposed to entertain for a parent, cast down from heaven, 
for sharing in the sin of the " Son of the Morning." No sooner did she 
hear of the arrest of her father, than she fled to his side. There is nothing 
in human history more touching than the hurried letters, blotted with 
tears, in which she announced her daily progress to Richmond ; for she 
was too weak to travel with the rapidity of the mail. Even the character 
of Burr borrows a momentary halo from hers, when we peruse his replies, 
in which, forgetting his peril and relaxing the stern front he assumed 
toward his enemies, he labored only to quiet her fears, and inspire 
her with confidence in his acquittal. He even writes from his prison 
in a tone of gayety, jestingly regretting that his accommodations are not 
more elegant for her reception. Once, and once only, does he melt ; and 
that is to tell her that in the event of the worst, he will die worthy of 
himself. 

After his trial, Burr went abroad, virtually a banished man. He was 
still full of his schemes against Mexico and the Spanish provinces ; but 
in England he met with no encouragement, the nation being engaged in 
the Peninsular war. He afterward visited France, where his petitions 
were equally disregarded, the Emperor being engrossed in the Continental 
wars. Here his funds failed. He had no friend to apply to, and was forced 
to borrow, on one occasion, a couple of sous from a cigar-woman on the 
corner of the street. 

At last he returned to New York ; but in how different a guise from 
the days of his glory ! No cannon thundered at his coming, no crowd 
thronged the wharf. Men gazed suspiciously upon him as he walked along, 
or crossed the street to avoid him, as one having the pestilence. But he 
was not, he thought, wholly destitute. His daughter still lived ; his heart

RICHMOND, June 29A, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : I recommend to you to place Mrs. Blen- 
nerhassett and your children with Mrs. Alston, till these 
agitations shall be composed. 

For other matters, I refer you to my friend, Major Ash 
ley, who will hand you this. 

Faithfully, yours, A. BURR. 

Mr. A. will perform his engagement. The bill for two 
thousand dollars was duly paid. 
H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



To Mrs. M. Blennerhassett. 

LEXINGTON, KY., Tuesday Eve., July 14A, 1807. 
On my arrival here to-day, I was taken into custody 
for my indorsement of some of Col. Burr's bills, of 
which I am now getting clear by an arrangement Mr. 



yearned to clasp her to his bosom. She left Charleston, South Carolina, 
accordingly, to meet him. But although more than thirty years have 
elapsed, no tidings of the pilot-boat in which she sailed have ever been 
received. Weeks grew into months, and months glided into years. Yet 
her father and husband watched in vain for her coming. Whether the 
vessel perished by conflagration, whether it foundered in a gale, or whether 
it was taken by pirates, and all on board murdered, will never be known, 
until the great day when the sea shall give up its dead. 

It is said that this blow broke the heart of Burr ; and that though in 
public he maintained a proud equanimity, in private tears forced them 
selves down his furrowed cheeks. He lived thirty years after this event ; 
but, in his own words, " felt severed from the human race." He had 
neither brother, nor sister, nor lineal descendant. No man called him by 
the endearing name of friend. The weight of fourscore years was on his 
brow. He was racked by disease. At last death, so long desired, came ; 
but, it is said, in a miserable lodging and alone. Was there ever such a 
retribution ? ANONYMOUS. 



260 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Clay is drawing up between Mr. Sanders and me, effected 
by my transferring Col. Alston's obligation, etc. Col. 
Mead's son, by a rapid journey from Richmond, per 
formed in twelve days, brings intelligence of bills of in 
dictment having been found against Col. Burr and my 
self for high treason and a misdemeanor, and that Burr 
is in close custody. The Federal marshal sent out to 
summon a jury from Wood county, and the trial fixed to 
come on the 3d of August. Burr's situation is thought 
to be perilous, as may be my own. If I go on to the 
Island or Marietta, I must expect to be immediately sent 
to Richmond. I have no idea of attempting an escape, 
which I could probably effect by Detroit to Canada. I feel 
conscious of all want of law or evidence to convict me, and 
shall therefore not seek to avoid an arrest anywhere, but 
promptly appear on any call for me at Richmond. Wil 
kinson will fall and be disgraced, whatever fate may 
attend Burr or myself. Seven of the grand jury were 
for presenting or indicting him, but all were unanimous 
for indicting Burr and me. I shall advise with Mr. Clay, 
this evening, on my situation, and the course I should 
pursue. It has appeared to me probable I should be 
arrested here, and sent on from hence ; Mr. Clay thinks 
that will not be ; you shall hear from me, however, the 
first new opportunity. Dudley Woodbridge, Edm. Dana, 
David Wallace, and almost every one you could suspect, 
have been taken to Richmond on subpenas ; John and 
S. Henderson, of course. Bollman has refused the Presi 
dent's pardon, as I should, unless it were issued upon 
petition to him from yourself and my respectable ac 
quaintances in the Mississippi Territory and the United 



INTERRUPTION. 261 

States, unsolicited by me. I will not fly, even from Wood 
county witnesses and juries. 

I must now tell you I was interrupted when I had writ 
ten so far, by a visit from Mr. David Mead, to arrest me 
on the part of the United States. He is an amiable, kind 
young man, with whom I shall set out in a few days for 
Richmond. He has offered me every service since I have 
been confined, and is very busy in summoning witnesses 
on behalf of Col. Burr. He has just left me in a new 
lodging, which is very comfortable, I assure you, being a 
clean, airy room in the jail, left entirely to myself, where, 
I call God to witness to you, I do not feel aj; all uneasy at 
the sense of confinement. It is true, I have not yet tried 
it half an hour ; but the same Providence that has ever 
supported me will let my time and my reflections flow as 
gmoothly here as if I were at liberty. You must serve the 
same God, and by strong and steady endeavors think of 
this, and the worst that persecutions can inflict upon me, 
as lightly as I do. Attend to the duties you owe, and the 
delights that will be afforded you, by our dear boys, till I 
see them again, which I shall surely do somewhere. For 
ward to Richmond an affidavit from my valued friend 
Harding, stating at large the proceedings that were had 
against me at Washington, and a duplicate, for fear of a 
miscarriage. The jailer, a civil American, of the name 
of Prentiss, has just informed me has orders to let no 
one speak to me but in his presence, and to let no letters 
come to me or go from me. I have just sent him out to 
demand of Col. Crocket, the United States Marshal, or 
Mr. Bibb, their Attorney, that I may write to you a sealed 
letter or an open one, as they will venture to prescribe. 



262 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

lie returns with an answer that I may send closed letters 
to you ; but any others I may wish to write must be seen 
by him and the jailer before they are sealed. I make 
memoranda of all these occurrences, which I read over to 
the jailer, and he has engaged to sign. 

If you wish to sympathize with me, do not grieve for 
my situation, as I am not at all discouraged. This even 
ing, 't is true, is warm ; but how much more distressing 
was the heat in the vast prairies and barrens I have 
passed through, tormented, too, day and night with 
insects, from which I am here free. Is my tumbler 
so greasy I can not wash it clear ? I am chemist enough 
to know that not a particle of the grease will adhere to 
the water ; and how very much cooler is my drink ! I 
have just been sent, per Joe, a mug of good tea, with 
toast, from Mrs. J., with mattress, sheets, etc. My win 
dows are grated, but large and open, and their appear 
ance no more disturbs my reflections, which kind Heaven 
never suffers to fail me, in place or time, than the figure 
of those we sometimes admired on the Island. You must 
dismiss, then, all concern for every mortification you will 
falsely think I suffer, except what arises from the want 
of the picture, which I do 'nt yet despair of, through the 
kind offices of a young man at Nashville, a printer, of 
the name of Rob. Alleson, who has kindly assured me he 
will engage himself to forward it to you or me. I must 
now close, to insure this letter time enough in the office 
to go by to-morrow's mail. Joe has just come to take 
them. God bless you! Write every post. Kiss my 
boys for me, and never fear a failure of my spirits or my 
constancy. HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 



FRIENDSHIP PROVED. 263 

To Mrs. M. Blennerhassett. 

LEXINGTON, July 18A, 1807. 

It should afford you the fullest proof of my contentment, 
in my present situation, to learn, that without any inter 
ruption of good health, I have not appropriated any part 
of my time, since Tuesday, to writing to you. When I 
was closing my letter to you that day, I thought it would 
go from hence next morning ; I am happy since to hear" 
it will not go forward before this, which, I hope, you will 
first read. In the midst of my occupation, by the cares 
of my concerns with the Government, I have made 
arrangements for removing, I expect, the greatest part 
of the incumbrances affecting our property on the Island. 
Miller, who, you know, attached the chief part of our 
effects, is not here, but will probably accept of the same 
accommodations, accepted by Mr. Sanders, namely, a 
transfer of Alston's obligation, with a deed of trust on 
the Island, as a further security. Our valued friend 
Harding will explain this to you. He ought to see my 
letters to you, while the press of more indispensable occu 
pation prevents my writing to him. Details relating to 
my arrest on Tuesday evening, and the proceedings that 
have already, and will hereafter occur, you will see, must 
be too voluminous to find place in my letters. You must 
content yourself with the statement you will find ot 
them in the papers. I will not fail, however, to give you 
such particulars as you may not see there. 

The degrees of adversity seem to graduate the scales 
of friendship, and the sincerity of the professions we 
receive in life. I have been visited by Col. Meade, who 



264 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

has not probably ridden to town for two years, on any 
two other occasions, while Morton, the Harts, and many 
others you would first count upon, have not appeared 
within the walls. More call upon me, however, than I 
wish to see, while poor Tracy is offended with me, be 
cause I will not take any of the little money he has 
gathered by so many years' hard earning, and several 
other persons daily load me with general offers of service. 
If confinement could, in itself, have any ills for me, they 
could not fail to be greatly abated, by the interest excited 
by my visitors and the unremitting exercise of my pen. 
But while I have these resources aided, besides, by the 
kindest attentions of the jailer and his family, who in no 
instance omits to render my situation not only easy, but 
even comfortable, without transgressing the line of de- 
markation between his duty and his inclination I hope 
the ease I experience, and the indifference I feel toward 
future prospects, will not induce you to suspect that the 
most loathsome dungeon, or the most unjust issue of my 
prosecution, could exhibit me unworthy of the favor of 
your constancy and virtue. Although I live very com 
fortably in every respect, Mrs. Sanders, late Miss Nich 
olas, persists in sending me a nice breakfast every 
morning, and Mr. Postlethwaite has endeavored to pro 
cure my removal to his house, a mile distant in the 
country ; but popular passion is so strongly engaged on 
the side of the Government, that it could not be effected 
in this focus of Democracy ; the ardor of which, however, 
I am generally assured the manner of my deportment, 
and address in the court have cooled down into some 
degree of sympathy and confidence in my honor. 



SPECIAL DIRECTIONS. 265 

I have been very much engaged the last two days in 
preparing letters and various papers for Joe to take to 
the Island. I got him off in the afternoon ; he took with 
him two new horses I got for the three I left Natchez 
with, which he will take to his uncle's on the Monanga- 
hela, and keep until he takes them down to Richmond, 
where I shall want him and Scott to prove the inveterate 
animosity borne me by some of the Wood county wit 
nesses I expect to appear against me. I think it probable 
I may have occasion, on my defense, to make use of the 
first letter I wrote to Col. Burr; that being destroyed, 
probably my letter-book may be received as evidence of 
its contents. The book, therefore, which I left in the 
small trunk, containing my papers, together with every 
letter you can there find, or in any part of my writing- 
desk, from Col. Burr to you, or myself, you must, with 
the aid of Mr. Harding, or other friends, whose zeal and 
punctuality can be depended upon, have forwarded to me 
at Richmond, together with the morocco case, containing 
my music, and the two sheets of manuscript I lent 
Mrs. Wallace, with my spectacles; the whole carefully 
packed, sealed and directed, in a small trunk or box, in 
the safest and most expeditious manner, by Orleans, to 
some port where I may get the earliest intelligence of its 
arrival, and thence procure it by the coach. I expected 
the return to town last evening of my young friend, Da 
vid Meade, from the country, where he is fatiguinyly 
employed in serving subpenas for witnesses on the part 
of Col. Burr. On Monday I shall set out in his charge 
he being deputy-marshal with a guard of four, three, at 
least, of whom are respectable, and will, I am assured, 



266 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

prove agreeable companions. I am extremely sorry to 
find the injury to private individuals of this country in 
consequence of a baseless authority for Burr's financial 
operations here last autumn, far exceeding my greatest 
suspicions. If it be shown that he had not funds and 
friends pledged to him to warrant his drafts, his conduct 
would appear nefarious enough to displace all the friend 
ships he ever formed. These strictures are particularly 
extracted from me by something I have heard of him 
relating to myself in a pecuniary sense, which will be 
examined, and come hereafter to your knowledge, if ma 
terial. They may therefore be kept secret from all but 
friends, in whose honor and attachment we can confide. 
David Meade has just left me. We shall certainly go on 
Monday, and proceed by easy journeys, comfortably 
equipped. Beware to enter upon Dominick's heart, but 
by small and cautious advances while informing him of 
my situation. Welcome the means you may derive from 
it, of forming him to a habit of patience and courage in 
suffering ; pity for the vices of mankind, and a steady 
contempt for malice, which the vengeance of power can 
never subdue. As it regards yourself, reflect and rejoice 
that your husband will not be unworthy of you by the 
tenor of his life ; while, through all the trials he may yet 
pass, the approving spirit of your virtue will embellish 
his fame and smile upon his courage. I have written to 
my friends, Jas. S. Lewis & Co., to honor Mr. Harding to 
amount of $500 or $600 to answer your occasions, as well 
as to accept all bills drawn by yourself, to amount of my 
remaining funds in their hands: this last instruction I 
gave them in contemplation of your making a small pur- 



DETENTION. 267 

chase, and having need of some money to make ready 
payments and prepare for getting in a crop the ensuing 
season, which you ought to endeavor to effect for the 
children in the manner I have proposed; though any 
other you may be advised to will not he displeasing to 
me. Mr. Biggs will soon, I hope, reach Natchez, with 
some few hands, and I have begged of Col. Gushing to 
endeavor, as soon as possible, to send you every thing he 
can from the Island, from whence I think it probable you 
will receive some supplies in the course of this fall. My 
detention at Richmond will extend nearly to Christmas, 
owing to the distances from which I shall be obliged to 
collect my witnesses ; so that if I shall be able to run the 
gauntlet through Democratic juries and witnesses, you 
may easily calculate the time I could return to you by 
sea, or by land and the Ohio, taking the Island in my 
way. In the mean time, it is possible I shall not be kept 
in jail, but confined in a comfortable way in the Peniten 
tiary, or other safe quarters, under guard, at Richmond, 
as Burr now is. The federal marshal there has a good 
character from David Meade, and is brother to General 
Scott. Continue to repeat to all our worthy friends, par 
ticularly Harding, Col. and Mrs. Scott, and Russell, etc., 
etc., my grateful obligations for their goodness to you ; 
tell Russell I do not cry " Divil burn the iron boults," 
though I sometimes sing " Smolileu." 

A mail in to-day from Natchez, and no letters from 
you. I have had but one ; the postmaster's date being 
23d ult., concerning the boys' works. For God's sake, 
write oftener, and give me the satisfaction of hearing 



268 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

how many of my letters, this making the seventh or 
eighth, you received from your husband, 

HARM AN BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. As I can't write to many of your friends, I hope 
all will excuse me. 

Sunday noon, July 19th. I am just going out to walk 
in town, to make some visits with the jailer. H. B. 



The following is a notice of the arrest and proceeding 
alluded to, taken from the " New World :" 

LEXINGTON, July 21st. 

On Tuesday last Herman Blennerhassett arrived in this 
town from the Mississippi Territory. Immediately on 
his arrival he was arrested, at the instance of Mr. Saun- 
ders, on a civil process, and before his discharge was 
again arrested by the marshal for the Kentucky district, 
on an affidavit made by Mr. David Meade, the purport 
of which was, that Blennerhassett had been indicted for 
treason, and a true bill found by the grand jury at Rich 
mond, Virginia. It fortunately happened that Judge 
Todd was in town, before whom Mr. Blennerhassett was 
immediately brought ; but as he wished to be heard by 
counsel, he was committed to jail, and ordered to be 
again before the judge at nine o'clock the next morning, 
at which time he read to the court an affidavit which he 
had drawn up. The crowd was so great that the editor 
was unable to hear the whole of it, but he understood it 
went to give a history of his arrest and discharges in the 



EXTRACT. 269 

Mississippi Territory ; of his being on his journey home, 
when he heard at Danville of the indictment being found 
against him ; of the means he used to ascertain the truth 
of the report ; and that being satisfied of its correctness, 
he had hastened to this place, to surrender himself to 
Mr. Bibb, attorney for the United States ; that soon after 
he arrived he was arrested upon a civil process ; that he 
had met with Mr. Clay, to whom he communicated his 
intentions, and requested advice as to the mode he should 
adopt ; that Mr. Clay said he was too much engaged to 
attend at that time to his applications, but promised to 
see him on the subject at nine o'clock the next day. He 
declared it to be his wish to be sent on to Richmond to 
receive his trial at that place. Mr. Clay, as counsel, 
assured the court, that he was instructed by his client to 
express his wish to be sent on for trial ; he only wished 
an unnecessary rigor might not be observed, and that he 
might be forwarded in a manner as delicate as the nature 
of his situation would permit. Mr. Clay at the same 
time took the liberty, as a citizen, to protest against, or 
rather object to, the mode which had been pursued by 
the court ; he viewed the proceedings unprecedented and 
illegal. He, however, wished it to be understood, that 
his observations were made as a citizen, and not at the 
instance of Mr. B. ; it was his real wish to be sent on for 
trial. Mr. Bibb stated that he had provided himself with 
authorities to prove the proceedings proper ; but that he 
had that morning inquired of Mr. Clay whether any ex 
ceptions would be taken to the legality of the proceedings, 
and being informed that none would be taken, had neg- 



270 , THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

lected to bring his authorities into court; that he was 
now surprised to find the exceptions taken. 

Mr. Clay stopped him again, to declare that the excep 
tions were not by the consent of Mr. B., who he believed 
was really desirous of being conveyed to Richmond. 

Mr. Blennerhassett assured the court that Mr. Clay 
had justly stated his desire, and pledged himself, that 
whatever .might be the decision of the judge, he would 
accompany Mr. Meade, the deputy-marshal, to Richmond. 
But he wished not to be understood as making a parade 
of willingness which he did not feel, of meeting investi 
gation, as he was more desirous of going as a prisoner at 
the public charge, than at his own expense, as his fortune 
was greatly impaired. He made an affecting appeal to 
the citizens of Lexington, which would have been very 
favorably received, had not the high crimes with which 
he was charged forcibly rebutted it. He spoke of the 
friendly attention and hospitable treatment experienced 
by himself and family, and hoped they would not believe, 
without evidence, that their attentions had been bestowed 
on unworthy objects. 

The judge took time to make up an opinion as to 
the proceedings which ought to be had in the case ; and 
issued a warrant for his commitment and safe keep 
ing, until the district-judge could be applied to, who 
ordered him to be delivered to the court in Richmond, 
without delay. 

He was yesterday sent off, attended by Mr. Meade and 
a guard of five men. 



UNPLEASANT TIDINGS. 271 

LEXINGTON, July 22d, 1807. 

SIR : Your favor of the 20th was delivered to me ; the 
apology you offer, on the subject of my fee, is abundantly 
sufficient, and the compensation you propose, adequate. 
You will be pleased to inclose a Virginia bank note to 
me from Richmond, by the mail. I did not understand 
that by the agreement between Mr. Sanders and you, 
Mr. Miller was to be any way interested in the " deed of 
trust " upon your Island, and am pretty positive it was 
not agreed that he should be concerned in it, which is 
evident, indeed, from the face of the deed itself. Never 
theless, you may give Miller an order upon Sanders, to 
pay him out of the proceeds of the sale of the Island, 
if they should exceed Mr. S.'s demand, and Mr. Alston 
should not be willing or forced to pay according to his 
engagement. I think, therefore, you ought to acknowl 
edge the deed before the General Court in Virginia. 
You will only, by refusing to do it, give Mr. Sanders the 
unnecessary trouble of having the deed returned to be 
proven and certified from this place, or commencing a 
suit against you, to coerce an acknowledgment. 

Your obedient servant, HENRY CLAY. 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



NATCHEZ, August 3d, 1807. 

MY DEAREST HUSBAND : After having experienced the 
greatest disappointment at not having heard from you 
for two mails, I at length learn of your arrest, which 
afflicts and mortifies me, because it was an arrest. 



272 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

think, had you of yourself gone to Richmond, and so 
licited a trial, it would have accorded better with your 
pride, and you would have escaped the unhappiness of 
missing my letters, which I wrote every week to Mari 
etta. God knows what you may feel and suffer on our 
account before this reaches you to inform you of our 
health and welfare, in every particular; and knowing 
this, I trust and feel your mind will rise superior to every 
inconvenience that your present situation may subject 
you to ; despising, as I do, the paltry malice of the up 
start agents of Government, and that you may in some 
measure be the means of exposing them to the world. 
Let no solicitude whatever for us damp your spirits ; we 
have many friends here, who do the utmost in their 
power to counteract every disagreeable sensation which I 
suffer from your absence. I have removed into a part of 
Mr. Moon's house, where I can scarcely feel the heat of 
the weather, having let mine to the French Consul, who 
has come to reside here. The boys have a good school, 
and I find many conveniences here which I wanted at 
Poindexter's house. Mrs. Whittle spends most of her 
time here, which is a great advantage now, when I do n't 
go any- where, which I have determined not to do till I 
learn the result of your affairs, though pressed by all my 
acquaintances to go to the country, where I spent some 
time before I learned of the alteration of your course. I 
inclose several letters of business to General Tupper, at 
Marietta, for you, among which was the one that Mr. 
Sorrel, of this place, had in his possession when he passed 
you in the wilderness, but which can be of no conse 
quence now. Mr, Biggs has returned with only three 



STRONG ATTACHMENT. 273 

negroes, not having been able to procure funds for more. 
I shall live in the hope of hearing from you next mail, 
and entreat you, by all that is dear to us, not to let any 
disagreeable feelings on account of our separation ener 
vate your mind at this time. Remember, that every one 
will read with great interest whatever concerns you, but 
still, do n't trust too much to yourself; consider your 
want of practice at the bar, and, if I still retain the same 
influence over you which you have over me, do n't spare 
the fee of a lawyer ; we shall never miss it in this coun 
try, and if we did, that, in such a case, should be no con 
sideration now. Assure Col. Burr of my warmest ac 
knowledgments for his and Mrs. Alston's kind remem 
brance, and tell him to assure her that she has inspired 
me with a warmth of attachment that never has, nor ever 
can diminish while I live. I wish him to urge her to 
write to me : a letter from her now would be most accept 
able God bless you ! M. BLENNERHASSETT. 

I hope you have done tormenting yourself about the 
loss of my picture. I inclosed you, to Marietta, what is 
of infinitely more value, the profiles of the two darling 
lovely boys. 



To Mrs. M. Blennerhassett. 

RICHMOND PENITENTIARY, 

Tuesday, Aug. 4^A, 1807. 

Do n't startle at a word ; I am not in the quarters of 
old M ; you must wait for a description of my lodg- 

mg until I conclude some little account of my journey 
18 



274 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

This has been as comfortable and accommodating as the 
severity of the weather and much fatigue would permit. 
The guard, consisting of five gentlemen, vied with each 
other all the way in emulating the exertions of that excel 
lent young man, David Meade, to promote my ease. I 
had, consequently, no restraint, and might, I believe, have 
effected my escape, if I had been disposed to attempt it. 
We arrived in town to-day, the 16th inclusive since we 
left Lexington, a quarter before 2 o'clock. We rode up 
to the Washington tavern, where we had an excellent 
dinner; after which I was visited by another deputy- 
marshal with a warrant for high-treason, and conducted 
in a carriage to this place, where I am lodged in a suite 
of commodious apartments, affording me a walk of forty 
paces in length, lately occupied by Col. Burr, who has 
been removed to another house, under guard, for the 
more convenient intercourse with his counsel during his 
trial ; these are numerous, and all volunteers in his 
defense. I was not half an hour here when I had a lively 
note from Col. Burr, a present of tea, sugar and cakes 
from Mrs. Alston, and a visit from Alston, and Edmond 
Randolph, to offer his advice and services gratis. Morgan 
Neville has been looking for me, and was denied admit 
tance to my room at the tavern, through officiousness or 
mistake, for all my friends may come here to me, though 
I can't go out to them. Mr. Randolph and Alston assure 
me the prosecutions for treason have already become 
ridiculous among the best informed, so that none of us 
will probably be hanged, nor can a conviction for the 
misdemeanor be effected from any thing we can learn, 
any more than from any acts or declaration of ourselves,

for none such ever escaped us to warrant one. Our only 
indemnity, therefore, will consist in our promoting the 
eclat, or whatever it may be, which will reward the zeal 
of the Government for our persecution. 

I had a visit to arrest the progress of my letter from 
Mr. Mercer ; he sat fully two hours with me, and was as 
interesting as he always is. My new lodging, though 
spacious and commodious, is unfurnished ; I have there 
fore been forced to have indispensable necessaries fur 
nished from the tavern, which, however, I shall only 
continue until I can make more economical arrangements. 
In my anxiety to save for you and the boys, I must still 
indulge my pride by spurning the liberal subsistence 
allowed by the United States to their State prisoners, of 
fifty cents per day. I hope you will duly receive my two 
letters from Lexington jail, and forward the things I 
therein wrote for. Request of Harding to see or write 
to Tyler, to advise him to offer a surrender of himself, 
and get subpened, if he does not hear soon after you get 
this, that the Government will abandon the chase they 
are at present engaged in ; I say abandon, for it is now 
generally believed, by all parties, that two of the grand 
jury, of the most respectable character, would not have 
concurred in finding any bill for treason, and none, pro 
bably, would have been found, if these had not mistaken 
the meaning of the judge's report of his opinion in case 
of Swartwout and Ogden. Having yesterday rode forty- 
five miles, and thirty-five to-day, before the variety of 
incidents that has occupied me this evening, and having 
other matters to engage me for an hour before I go to 
bed, I will reserve the rest of this sheet for such part of 



276 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the news of to-morrow as may concern me, and may not 
reach you through the papers. Good night. 

Wednesday, 11 o'clock, P. M. Variety is charming, and 
never more pleasantly exemplified than in the succession 
of that of my levees here. I believe I should have been 
stupid, or perhaps indisposed a little to-day, from the 
transition from great exercise in the open air and broiling 
sun to sudden confinement, if I was not almost hourly 
stimulated by the appearance of some person I am pleased 
to see, or the hearing of some news to interest me. As 
to persons, I have seen this morning Mr. Botts, who will 
also take part in my defense, without pecuniary compen 
sation from me, and I expect his example will be followed 
to-morrow by a similar offer from Mr. Wickham. Tell 
Harding my indictment, as appears from a printed copy 
sent to me this evening, contains two counts ; the first for 
levying war against the United States on the 10th of De 
cember, which will be attempted to be supported by the 
perjured evidence of Taylor and Albright, of resistance 
made to General Tupper's arresting me ; while Tupper 
will prove he never attempted to arrest me, or any of the 
party ; for which insolent behavior of his, bye-the-bye, 
it is rumored that he is threatened also with a State pros 
ecution. The other count is for planning, and going 
down the river on the llth, to effect the seizure of New 
Orleans, which I suppose the evidence of the Hendersons 
is chiefly relied upon to maintain ; but this testimony I 
shall also, I expect, be able to defeat; also, let him know 
or read that in filling many of the blank spaces with my 
name, which occurs several times, an e is uniformly used 
in the Christian name, instead of an a, as I have ever 



POSTPONEMENT OF TRIAL. 277 

written it, and in the surname an a is as often used as 
an e. I want to learn from him whether any, and what, 
advantages may be taken of these variances, and when ? 

To return to my visitors D. Wbodbridge and Edmond 
Dana called in the morning, both my friends, by whom I 
heard Joe had safely given all the papers I charged him 
with to Col. Gushing. A great deal of property has been 
sold, I hear, but the purchasers are friendly enough to offer 
to let me have it, by placing them as they were before the 
sales. No negroes are sold, but all are vagrant and latitant ; 
still none will be lost. The laws of Virginia and Kentucky 
only allow an absent debtor or defendant to come in 
within seven years, and set aside, or seek redress for a 
sale made against law or equity. Again, it seems as if 
every one I ever knew, and more, were now in Richmond ; 
for to-day the prosecuting counsel had about one hundred 
witnesses called in court, and, for the second time, put off 
the trial for two days, because about fifty more did not 
appear ; and nothing less than Morgan Neville and Bob 
Robison were here this evening. 

Friday, 8 o'clock, A. M. I was a little indisposed yes 
terday, which, with the hinderance of company, etc., pre 
vented my writing. A small dose of ipecac, has to-day 
restored my strength and appetite, so that I hope I have 
already surmounted whatever seasoning may have been 
necessary to fit me for the sojourn I shall make in this 
place. Mr. Wickham, as was expected, waited upon me, 
with Mr. Botts ; these, with Mr. Randolph, all three my 
gratuitous counsel, I severally and distinctly assured, no 
apprehension of a capital conviction, or sentence of death, 
could induce me to draw from the sympathies and exi- 



278 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

gencies of my family to defray any charge of my defense, 
either at present or any after period I could contemplate. 
Mr. "W., a staunch Federalist, and Messrs. Randolph and 
Botts, perhaps as warm Democrats, are of opinion I shall 
be enlarged on Col. Burr's acquittal of the treason charge, 
if I can procure bail for the misdemeanor, which I sup 
pose I could easily do, but would as soon remain where I 
am, until all the claims of Government upon me are dis 
posed of. It will much depend on the progress and turn 
of Burr's trial, when mine can come on, though our cases 
will be kept as wide apart as truth and their merits justly 
require. It is truly painful to me to tell you to expect 
nothing from the Island, though most of the purchasers, 
even Miller, the principal, would return the property on 
the terms I have before mentioned ; yet the recovery of 
any thing depends on his acceptance of the best and only 
arrangements Alston can make. Alston is endeavoring to 
raise money here to meet all the demands, the success of 
which I shall learn to-day or to-morrow, but little depend 
upon. On failure of this, he, Alston, will assume the 
whole, payable one-half a year from next January, the 
remainder the January following, with interest. The 
impossibility, he declares, to raise money in Carolina, by 
sale or mortgage, and his having fewer negroes than his 
estates require, make this the best arrangement he can 
make ; but which, I fear, will not be accepted. I will 
endeavor to learn and effect the speediest means of for 
warding to you as many of the negroes as possible, 
which, I suppose, you will hire out ; but, in all your 
affairs, be Harding your guide. 

Alston talks confidently of Burr's recovering his de- 



TENDER OF FRIENDSHIP. 270 

mands upon Government, to the amount of 50,000. 
This event would be prosperous, indeed, but I have little 
faith in it. Mercer has sat an hour with me since last 
sentence ; news to-day by him is all war, traced up to 
declarations by the President, that the ground the Gov 
ernment will take is the inviolability of a neutral flag ; 
every one is in arms, to be ready on the first signal to 
take Quebec and the West Indies. Mercer prays you to 
accept the admiring homage of his remembrance ; I send 
my letters for you, by arrangement with him under cover 
to his friend B. Taylor, Esq., attorney- at-law, Alexandria, 
who will duly forward them to Scott. You will also 
inclose to the same gentleman, who will forward your 
letters to me through Mr. Mercer. I have just received a 
tender of friendship by Mr. Ormsby, of Kentucky, from 
General Henry Lee, and offers of soups, jellies, etc., from 
Mrs. Carrington, with their compliments.

MY DEAR SIR: You may take it an ill compliment 
that I tell you I am heartily glad to hear of your arrival. 
Mr. Alston and Mr. Neville successively made attempts 
to see you at the tavern, but were denied. Having this 
minute heard that you have gone to my late quarters, I 
send to inquire of your health, of that of Mrs. Blenner- 
hassett's, and in what I can be useful to you. What 
counsel shall I send you ? 

Faithfully yours, A. BURR.

August 5^, 1807. 

I am much gratified, my dear sir, by your letter and 
notes. It is impossible for us to communicate freely, ex 
cept through the intervention of counsel. I recommend 
to you to employ Mr. Randolph and Mr. Botts, and that 
you write a line to each of them this morning. They 
will not expect money, at least at present, and when I 
shall be discharged, I shall be able to furnish it. Write 
also to your friend Emmett,* to come on forthwith. My 
trial is essentially yours; it will settle principles which 
will govern in both. The political character of Mr. Em- 
mett will give him weight ; and it is greatly to be desired 
that a man of discernment and impartiality should wit 
ness the mode of these prosecutions and the extraordi 
nary efforts and extraordinary means used to produce 
conviction, right or wrong. 

Your faithful friend, A. BURR.

funds, and the helpless state of your children, must op

Friday, August 
I perceive the advantages from your presence, but am 
not at this moment able to decide whether the thing be 
practicable. One or more of our counsel will wait on 
you this afternoon, to confer on this and other points. 

I am surrounded by visitors, which prevents me from 
adding more than the assurances of my respect and at

A. BURR.* 

To Blennerhassett. 

NATCHEZ, August 16th. 

Your first letter from Lexington has just come to hand, 
and, notwithstanding the predictions of your former one, 
I do n't find it by any means so melancholy as the first I 
received, as it assures me of your accommodations in that 
place (which I can neither bear to repeat or write) to be

could be allowed to examine witnesses as his (Burr's) agent or advocate, 
or at least be present at their examination. 



282 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS.^ 

much better than I expected. I also feel now, that in 
such a court as Richmond, absolute falsehoods can't pass, 
when, in opposition to all that can be sworn to by Wood 
county, you have the most respectable witnesses from the 
State of Ohio ; and surely every person in Belpre* can 
testify that Tyler's boats landed on the Jsland in noon 
day, and had no arms on board, and admitting that what 
all these villains said were true, how were you concerned 
in what was done by Tyler or others ? Ashley has told 
Mr. Harding that Peter Taylor said something that in 
jures you ; and Col. Burr writes in his letter to Harding, 
which I have seen, that " Mr. Blennerhassett has injured 
him, both by what he has said and what he has written." 
Good God ! what a world this is : tell Col. Burr, from 
me, if you think it worth while, that I wanted not thia 
aggravation to my unhappiness ; at least, that I looked 
not for aggravations from him. He also writes to tell 
you to place your family with Mrs. Alston : tell him were 
Mrs. Alston only in question, I would now, this moment, 
without hesitation, take refuge with her, and that I 
should not think my life even worth its present value, did 
not I hope once more to see and converse with that 
woman whom I think almost above human nature ; but 
I would at the same time do nothing that might lessen 
the dignity of the attachment I feel for her. 

We are under the greatest obligations to Doctor Com- 
mins, for carrying your package, which you will receive 
sooner than you could any other way. 

I believe, from what I have learned, that Tyler will 
injure you, if he can ; he is by this time arrested. Now 
let me again intreat you to spare no costs that can serve 



PERJURY. 283 

you ; if our negroes come down from the Ohio, I repeat 
again, we can make a good beginning here. Capt. Percy 
has been here again, urging me to go to the Spanish 
dominions, where you will be well received, and where I 
shall make a visit, when I know the termination of your 
prosecution. I spent three days at Col. Scott's since I 
wrote the letter you will receive with this. You may 
perceive my spirits are much mended ; but I am still de 
termined to adhere to what I then said I would, in case the 
perjury of the mob should prevail ; though every con 
versation I hear on the subject tends to encourage me, at 
least with regard to yourself. I shall write every mail to 
assure you of the health of myself and the boys. 

Farewell for another week ! remember that your fami 
ly are well, and that you are adored by your

To Blennerhassett. 

NATCHEZ, Aug. 2Gth, 1807. 

My usual depression of spirits has been much increased 
by not having received any letter from you by this mail, 
aided by the shock of hearing from Ashley to-day, for the 
first time, that it was by the perjury of Peter Taylor that 
a bill was found against you. 'T is true, I feel fully con 
fident such evidence must be done away with ; but I also 
feel, that it is owing to this alone that you are in your 
present situation, the thoughts of which haunt me night 
and day. Gracious God ! confined in a prison in the dog- 
days, and by the perjury of a wretch not many degrees 



284 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

from a brute ! I used to give him credit for the utmost 
honesty; but it is in vain, I am convinced more and 
more every day, to expect principle without some refine 
ment, at least where interest is concerned. Ashley says 
he hears they have given the wretch a tract of land some 
where. If this can be proved, it will be sufficient. As 
for Albright, I can make oath to his secreting our two 
negroes, who ran away when you left the Island ; and 
Elmwood, the blacksmith, told me of his taking stolen 
melons and sweet potatoes to Marietta to sell for negro 
Jim, whom he saw steal them out of the field, where 
there were no others but mine. I see plainly enough, the 
Wood county rabble only want some pretext to vindicate 
their plunder; but I feel great confidence in the evidence 
I trust you will have from Marietta and Belpre*, and 
hope no lawyers' fees will be spared. "Why can't I be 
with you ? But I feel it would not do ; your mind is 
stronger without me, and the boys are an insurmountable 
objection to my going round, which I should only do in 
a case that I hope can't possibly happen. 

I have only been to Mrs. Scott's since I heard of your 
arrest, and shall probably not go anywhere until I learn 
the result. Miss Percy is still with me. Major T., who 
visits me often, begs to be kindly remembered to you. 
Dr. Commins left home, I believe, three days ago, for 
Richmond, where he was called as a witness by Govern 
ment. He took with him all the papers, etc., you wrote 
for from Lexington, but I suppose this will reach you 
first, though he went through the wilderness and took a 
pack-horse. 



FEVER UNAVOIDABLE. 285 

The boys are well, and still, thank God ! insensible of 
your situation, though they often pierce me to the heart 
by their questions about you, and threaten very often, 
when I correct them, to " tell their pappy how bad I 
am.'* They both of them join in sending, to use their 
own phrase, " their good love to their dear pappy." 

I wish, when your mind is fully disengaged from your 
present embarrassments, that you would make a thorough 
calculation of the profits and losses between this country 
and the one we have left. Perhaps you may sell the 
Island ; if you can do so, it will be best ; if not, nothing 
but a certain loss would prevent my wish of returning 
there. My attachment for that place is strong indeed, 
but not so strong as to entirely counterbalance our inter 
est ; at the same time, I would have you consider there is 
only one thing in favor of this country the raising of cot 
ton which for a moment gives it any preference ; for, in 
spite of all you may have heard, it is a sickly country, 
both for black and white. Intermitting fever is inevita 
ble ; both the children have had it, but Harman's was 
the worst; he was completely cured by Dr. S., with 
whom I am much delighted as a physician. Dominick 
was then attacked, but I stopped the progress of the dis 
order myself. I am told Bayou Sara is much more 
healthy generally than the vicinity of Natchez, where 
fevers are constant ; and from this statement of the sick 
ness of this country I leave you to judge how far it will 
agree with your constitution. As to mine, I believe it is 
impossible I ever should have an "intermittent;" I only 
suffer at times from the pain in my breast, which uni- 



286 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

formly increases in proportion to the anxiety of my mind. 
I grow very thin, notwithstanding my appetite is good; 
but I believe nobody's mind ever had more influence on 
the body than mine, but do n't let this concern you ; all I 
suffer now will only tend to make me completely happy, 
on your delivery from your present situation, which, I 
begin to think, must take place soon. 'T is not possible 
you can be injured by the perjury of such complete 
fools. 

The cotton crop promises very badly on account of the 
drought, in all the land about Natchez ; but wherever the 
land is new, the drought does not affect it. Now let me 
urge you to weigh well the advantages and disadvan 
tages of this country, and let your mind be no way in 
fluenced by what you have thought of the society of the 
place. It is not what I at first supposed it ; and any way, 
I consider it scarce a feather in the scale. If you can sell 
the Island, do n't hesitate to do so ; if not, consider that 
while we are making money here we are losing it by 
the house going to rack, and the land lying idle there ; 
whereas, if we can keep up that place, it, with the in 
crease of our negroes, will be enough for the boys ; 
then, on the other hand, if we go to Bayou Sara and 
plant cotton for four or five years, we may, at the end 
of that time, be enabled to go to the Northern States. 
Consider well what I have said, and remember that, at 
all events, your happiness is the first object with your

KICHMOND, August 27th, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : Mr. Luckett* and I have an unsettled ac 
count to a considerable amount. He holds a bill indorsed 
by you. If you can devise means to procure him any aid 
at this moment, it would gratify me much. 

Your faithful and obedient, A. BURR.

Burr to Blennerhassett. 

September 1st, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : It seems that some misapprehension exists 
on the subject of the bill held by Mr. Luckett. I could 
not with delicacy propose to you to take up my bill ; but 
I repeat that it would gratify me that it could be done. 
My present inability is too manifest. Yours, perhaps, not 
very different. If, however, you choose to request Alston 
to assume this bill as part of his engagement to you, the 
arrangement would give me real pleasure, and I have no 
doubt may be made satisfactory to him. 

I felicitate you on the events of yesterday, and am 
alway faithfully yours.

To Mrs. Bhnnerhassett. 

RICHMOND, YA., Sept. l~Lth, 1807. 

A few days have elapsed since I might have written to 
you to announce the second event that rendered last 
Monday remarkable as a day on which I might he sup 
posed to have "been elated with the long desired change 
of my condition for the better. That was the termina 
tion of my imprisonment, by the abandonment on the 
part of the prosecutors of the indictment against me for 
treason, and my admission to bail, under the other indict 
ment for a misdemeanor. But the receipt of your letter 
of the 3d ultimo, by a speedy arrival, was the event 
which constituted the first blessing that day returned to 
so many hopes and prayers offered up to obtain it. I 
have since received, I believe, all your other letters from 
Marietta, though your negligence in omitting dates dis 
tresses me, as I am ignorant of any time which I can con 
nect with any thing you tell me of yourself, the boys, or 
our friends. I am delighted with the profiles. It would 
cost you more calculation than you will ever enter upon 
to discover the one-hundredth part of the lines, or parts 
of lines and curves, on which I shall rapturously specu 
late in these bits of paper. You know it is not my tem 
per to feel surprise or emotion on transition from one 
extreme to another. I therefore passed from imprison 
ment to liberty with the same unconcern with which you 
have sometimes observed me to take the air, after three 
days voluntary confinement. But this may be more ex 
plicable from some daily notes I have kept for you since 
my arrival at Lexington. Our ingenious Harding will 



DEATH. 289 

not be a little surprised to learn from you, that after a 
deprivation of liberty for fifty-three days, I was freed 
from the treason case, on which I had been arrested at 
Lexington, without arraignment, and shall probably get 
clear of the misdemeanor case in the same way, by the 
success of six similar points, which will be decided, I 
expect to-morrow, by the court, in favor of Burr. So 
you see I have little prospect of an opportunity to speak 
in my own cases, especially as I am so well provided with 
counsel. Still there is a chance of my being here put on 
trial for the misdemeanor, or being involved in the issue 
of a motion to send us to the Kentucky district for trial, 
in either of which events I shall say something. 

I have had two dollars worth of letters forwarded 
from Philadelphia : first, from Ireland ; two from Mar 
tin, one telling me to inquire after an estate he thinks 
has fallen to me of 6,000 a year, by the death of 
Lord Eoss, ci-devant Oxmantown, and Captain Jones, 
in the "West Indies, next to whom I stand in the entail. 
I do not wish you to build at all on this intelligence, 
though it is not at all improbable it may be realized. 
Should that ever happen, in how many instances may our 
gratitude do justice, in fact, to our dispositions. I hope 
I shall within a week re-open the small credit our nar 
row funds will entitle us to in Philadelphia. Lewis has 
already written to me, to say he will endeavor to have 
every bill taken up his house had rejected, that he can 
come at. I board with Major Smith, at a comfortable 
house, as cheap as we can, i. e., at seven dollars a week 
each, but shall proceed to Marietta as soon as I am dis 
charged from the court., as I do not expect any attempt,

if made for our transmissal to another district, will pre 
vail. Do, however, continue to write hither until other 
wise advised. 

I can add little more by this mail than to say, I am not 
sufficiently satisfied you can so surely he healthy where 
you are, in the fall, as if you were six or seven miles from 
the river. Therefore, on the earliest threatening to your 
self or the hoys of any autumnal attack, I entreat and 
enjoin you to let nothing prevent your removal. 

It would be impossible to enumerate all our excellent 
and accomplished friends ; still more so to say the hun 
dredth part of what my gratitude would express to them 
for their generous attention to you. You will acquit me 
of this duty with every one of them as well as you can. 
I wrote to Harding, who I hope will long enjoy his and 
Winthrop's good health. Colonel and Mrs. Scott, Mrs. 
"Whittle, and friends, have, with many others, claims 
upon my grateful regards that will never be obliterated.

as time and circumstances will permit.

in his journey, you may not get it until after one or two 
other letters of more advanced date may reach you by post 



ANTICIPATION. 291 

It will, however, serve to quiet your anxiety for my delay 
in arriving at Xatchez, as that pleasure must give way to 
the control of contingencies I can not govern. This day 
all the evidence is closed on the motion now before the 
court, for our transmissal to Kentucky ; the debates will 
end, and the motion be refused, I have every reason to 
believe, by Saturday ; but, in that event, I shall be de 
tained, three or four days, to put my demands on Col. 
Burr on some footing of adjustment ; after which I pro 
pose to use all diligence I can to haste to Marietta, from 
whence, I fear, I shall find great difficulty in effecting the 
recovery and removal of the negroes. I can not teaze 
you with particulars of my expectations ; I may have to 
go to Philadelphia or South Carolina, and, possibly, not 
be able to descend the river until after it shall break up in 
the latter part of January. You must economize in the 
mean time, and seek all the resources you can draw from 
the friends who surround you. I will write again by 
Tuesday's post; I have not cared to risk many letters, as 
you see weekly by the papers, or must conclude, I am 
every day before the court. I wish you to be very 
reserved in all your communications, except with Hard 
ing, whom I wonder you have not mentioned in every 
letter I received from you. I had none since Sunday's 
mail, and since the news of our boy's sickness, by yours 
of 25th August ; I am truly miserable in my alarms for 
my Harman, whose situation, as well as your own, with 
regard to the pain in your breast, I can see you have im 
parted to me with reluctance and reserve. 

Perhaps we shall yet enjoy ease and wealth, if Martin's 
expectations of my succeeding to the estates of the late

am warranted to add them. Assure Dr. S. of perfect 
esteem and confidence in his talents and learning, and 
cultivate the opportunities of his closest attendance upon 
yourself and the boys. I have no news by this opportunity ; 
it is uncertain and precarious. Adieu !

MY DEAREST FRIEND : I know you must think it 
strange at not having heard from me since your arrival 
in Richmond, and I am sure you must think it untimely 
in bidding you now farewell, to give only this paltry 
proof of my most affectionate regard and friendship ; yes, 
my dear Blennerhassett, my thoughts have been con 
stantly occupied in reflecting on those poignant and try 
ing afflictions, with which it has pleased a cruel destiny 
to overwhelm you, and for which I feel, not as the gen 
eral run of mankind, but as one, I may say without 
vanity, not unworthy to participate, as I really and sin 
cerely do, in your griefs. How often have I thought of

Mrs. Blennerhassett ; I feel so much for your misfortunes 
that I durst not glance at the cause of them. I am now 
on the eve of embarking for our loved and native country ; 
I go by the way of England, for the more safety. Per 
mission was granted me, by the last administration, to 
return for a twelvemonth, and I now take advantage of 
it in the hope of recovering my former estate, which, if 
I should, I may not only be a very independent, but a 
rich man in this country. Should I succeed, my friend 
of which there is but little doubt you and your estima 
ble lady shall find by my actions, instead of words, what 
I truly and sincerely feel toward you both. In the mean 
time, I have made a friend for you, who offers to come 
forward in a pecuniary point of view, if necessary. The 
person is Mr. Pierce Butler, of Philadelphia, a noble- 
minded countryman of burs, with whom you need feel no 
scruple in calling upon in this way. The offer came, un 
solicited, from himself, and he requested me to mention 
it to you. As I can not, unfortunately, at present, do 
more, I have nothing more to say, and conclude, my dear 
friend, with an affectionate remembrance to Mrs. Blen 
nerhassett, 

Your truly attached and unalterable friend, 

J. DEVEREUX. 
HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



To Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

RICHMOND, VA., Oct. I9th, 1807. 

This day's mail, my beloved, brought me your double 
letter from Natchez, and Col. Ellis's, of the 3d and 8th 



294 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ult., though I see, by the Washing-ton postmark, it did 
not leave that office before the 15th. You have not, I 
find, been spared by the climate. Well, I trust in the 
favor of Heaven for the full re-establishment of your 
health, through the same mercy to me that has granted 
your recovery. My misery has been severe, from not 
having heard from you for three weeks back. During 
my anxiety for the cause of my disappointment, I attrib 
uted the latter to a relapse of Harman's sickness, which 
much distressed me. There is certainly a Providence 
which ordains, in compassion of our weaknesses, that we 
shall sometimes dread calamities far less than that it is 
pleased to conceal from us. But why do you permit your 
concern for me to weaken your strength or deject your 
spirits ? you might conclude from the papers, the worst 
that can befall me is the loss of three or four months' 
detention from you. To-morrow, I expect we will all be 
discharged ; after which nothing shall retard my return 
to you, but the care I must give to your property and 
affairs. Why fret about what you regard without due 
consideration, the disappointment of that confidence you 
have heedlessly placed in mankind ? What claim could 
your merits have upon the envy of upstart's ? Is not the 
sincere attachment of two or three friends of more value 
than the momentary and lying attentions of the crowd ? 
But why dwell as you do upon the Island ? Have you 
forgotten Marietta and Wood county, or can you regen 
erate them ? or, if we should succeed to 6,000 or 7,000 
a year, by the decease of Lord Oxmantown, etc., would 
you bury it with ourselves on the Island ? Compose your 
self, therefore, till we meet, if it should not be these six 



FRIENDSHIP PROVEN. 295 

months ; if we should still prefer a cabin near Fort 
Adams, but six miles from the Mississippi swamp, where 
none of us, please God, need fear to encounter the climate. 
I rejoice to learn that you find a new friend to replace 
some old ones, who have not . stood the test. If H. has 
not sunk the man in the merchant, he will prove a 
brilliant exception to Harding's rule, pronounced against 
the influence of mercantile habits and obscure birth. It 
will be no consideration with him, that we may yet draw 
for his indemnity upon other funds than our grateful 
hearts. Harding's own rule will preserve him steadfast ; 
but you should not mention to any living person the 
pecuniary prospects opened to us, were it only the better 
to enable us to prove the hearts of others, but also be 
cause it may not be realized. 

It will not surprise you to learn that I have had unsolicit 
ed offers of horses and money, which I have declined. ~No 
less than three Irishmen have come forward in this way ; 
namely, Jas. O'Hennessey, a Kerry-man, who never spoke 
to me until he rode hither, 105 miles to see me ; Mr. Pat. 
Hendren, a lawyer, in easy circumstances, settled thirty 
miles from hence ; and Mr. Pierce Butler, whom I have 
never seen, who resides in Philadelphia, is very wealthy, 

and has made an unlimited offer through D . Mr. 

Chevallie'r lent me 1,000 to-day, to send to a negro sale, 
which I have not used, and shall return untouched ; and, 
while I was confined in the Penitentiary, General H. Lee 
offered me similar aid through a friend. Thus we find a 
few choice spirits to compensate for the inconstancy of 
false friends. May they reconcile us to the world. 



296 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

I have only written one letter by mail since I left the 
Penitentiary. I missed two post-days through my attend 
ance on the court, or some other unavoidable occupation ; 
but I confided two letters for you to private conveyance, 
by Strickland and Col. McKee ; if you have not already 
discontinued writing to me at this place, you will do so 
from the time this reaches you. I shall possibly go to 
Baltimore and Philadelphia before I see the Ohio ; if so, 
I shall accompany Burr to one or the other, in a day or 
two. I forbear to trouble you with my motives until I 
can impart the result. 

Our long-protracted contest with the Government has 
blasted "Wilkinson's fame and credit, never to be revived, 
though the investigations may not exhibit Burr's charac 
ter or designs unequivocally immaculate. But my name 
has so regularly met your eye in the papers weekly, that 
it was unnecessary to detail particulars ; you would, of 
course, conclude I was daily present in court. As to my 
health, I never enjoyed better ; though I had two or three 
slight illnesses while in confinement, I have since recov 
ered much more flesh than I lost there. 

Tuesday, 20th. Since writing the above, yesterday 
evening, I had a pretty long consultation with Burr, the 
result of which is a more probable conjecture that I shall 
go to Philadelphia with him, to try his success there in 
raising some money for me. I will write frequently to 
advise you of my movements. I have no words to ex 
press my feelings for Kitty Perry's kindness. I hope we 
shall ever retain her attachment. 

Your husband, H. BLENNERHASSETT. 



MEN OF TALENT. 297 

For various reasons, which it is not necessary here to 
enumerate, the trials of Burr, Blennerhassett, Dayton, 
John Smith of Ohio, Comfort Tyler, Israel Smith of ]S"ew 
York, and Davis Floyd, were postponed, from time to time, 
until the third of August. From the fifth until the seven 
teenth of the month , the court was engaged in obtaining a 
jury for the trial of Burr, and discussing points of law. 

Never before, in the history of the country, was wit 
nessed so grand a display of legal acumen and forensic 
talent. Upon the bench sat the venerated Marshall, spot 
less in purity, and, for soundness of judgment, without 
an equal. Calm, dignified, and attentive, he analyzed the 
arguments of counsel, and noted their relevancy with the 
nicety of a critic. At the bar was Wirt, whose fervid and 
soul-thrilling eloquence, even on this very trial, placed 
him at once among the first of American orators. With 
a brilliancy of imagination which startled his auditors, 
he swayed the minds of the jury with wonderful effect. 
There, too, was Martin, who had been previously distin 
guished, in the trial of Judge Chase, before the United 
States Senate. Every word that he uttered, like a two- 
edged sword, pierced the arguments of his opponents at 
every point. There was Hay ; always ready to take ad 
vantage of suspicious circumstances, and wield them, 
with tenfold force, against the prisoner. There was Ran 
dolph, slow, calculating, and careful; building up the 
vulnerable points of his case against the attacks of his 
adversaries. There was Botts, facetious and playful; 
sometimes descending to the ludicrous, but often rising, 
with convincing argument, to the grand. There was 
Wickham, dignified and commanding; taking up his 



298 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

subject with a master hand, and holding it to view, in 
every conceivable light. And there, too, was Burr, 
proudly pre-eminent, in point of intelligence, to his breth 
ren of the bar. He had been the Yice-President of the 
United States. He was accused of the highest and dark 
est crime in the criminal code. He stood before the su 
preme tribunal of his country, with the eyes of the 
nation gazing upon him. In the opinion of many, he 
was already condemned. He had the talent and tact, 
and the resources of the government, to contend against. 
Every faculty of his mind was exerted in his own defense. 
The magnitude of the charge ; the number of persons in 
volved; the former high standing and extraordinary 
fortunes of the accused, had excited an interest in the 
community, such as never before had been known. The 
witnesses against him were mostly officers of the Govern 
ment, with whom, at one time or another, he had been in 
some way connected. 

For twenty-six days, the court was arduously engaged in 
the investigation of the offense. The evidence of sixty wit 
nesses had to be examined and noted. Meanwhile, there 
being no suitable quarters in the city, Burr was confined 
in the Penitentiary, in the suburbs of Eichmond. Every 
day he was matched into court, on foot, escorted by a body 
guard of two hundred men, which would have done honor 
to an eastern prince. On the first of September, the jury 
returned a verdict u that Aaron Burr is not proved to 
be guilty, under the indictment, by any evidence submitted 
to us ; we, therefore, find him not guilty" Burr objected 
to the verdict, as being incorrect in point of form, and 
asked that the same might be given in the usual way 



NOT GUILTY. 299 

simply, " Not Guilty." Mr. Hay answered, that, in fact ? 
it was a verdict of acquittal ; and that it should be en 
tered in the jury's own words. 

"There was no precise form of words by which the 
jury should be governed." 

" They have no right to return a written verdict at 
all," replied Burr ; " they have no right to depart from 
the usual form." He then called for the recital of the 
common directions given the jury by the clerk. They 
were read, and end as follows : 

" If you find him guilty, you are to say so : if not 
guilty, you are to say so, and no more" 

" The jury can not be indulged," said Burr. " They 
have defaced a paper belonging to the court, by writing 
upon it words which they have no right to write. They 
ought to be sent back." After a short consultation, it 
was agreed that the simple verdict of " Not Guilty " 
might be entered on the records of the court. 

On the ninth of September, Burr was again arraigned, 
upon an indictment for a misdemeanor, which consisted 
of seven counts ; the substance of which was, that Aaron 
Burr did set on foot a military enterprise, to be carried 
on against the territory of a foreign prince, viz., the prov 
ince of Mexico, which was within the territory of the King 
of Spain, with whom the United States were at peace. 

After the prosecution had examined some of their wit 
nesses, and the court had decided that the testimony of 
others was not relevant, the District Attorney made a 
motion to discharge the jury. To this motion Burr 
objected; insisting upon a verdict. This was on the fif 
teenth of the month. The court, being of opinion that 



300 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the jury could not, in this stage of the case, be discharged, 
without the consent of the accused, they accordingly- 
retired, and very soon returned with a verdict of " Not 
Guilty." 

To Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

RICHMOND, VA., Oct. 22d, 1807. 

Ashley offers a desirable opportunity of informing you 
of the effect of the final order -of the court here, which 
is, that Burr and myself are to be tried at Chillicothe, on 
the first Monday in next January, for a misdemeanor. I 
speak of the effect, because it is generally understood the 
Government will drop all further proceedings. The judge 
has given this as his private opinion off the bench. Hay 
has expressed the same belief; and all further ideas of 
prosecuting for treason must be at an end, as the judge, 
in giving his opinion yesterday, declared no ground was 
laid before him, by the evidence, to entertain a suspicion 
of an overt act, having been committed, which was essen 
tial in making out the charge, though he thought proof 
enough had been exhibited of a treasonable design. It is 
therefore probable the recognizance I entered into yester 
day with Doctor Commins and Major Smith, my securi 
ties for my appearance at Chillicothe, will in the end be 
of no other use than to enlarge the records of the court. 

Thus, you perceive, I shall probably never again be a 
prisoner, and will not be prevented from descending the 
river, before it closes, if I do not learn, by intelligence 
expected from the President the day after to-morrow, 
through the Attorney-general, that Government intends 
to abandon all further proceedings against us. 



CALCULATIONS. 301 

I think I shall go with " B." from hence, on Saturday, 
for Philadelphia, four days journey thither, and a stay of 
three or four days there will leave me a full month for 
my journey to Marietta, the transacting of whatever busi 
ness I can finish in that quarter, and getting under way 
afloat. 

I will write a line, through the Federal city, to apprise 
you of my freedom from further probable molestation 
by Government, or obstruction in my journey to Natchez, 
where I hope to arrive, not far from New- Year's day. 
One way or the other, I am very anxious this informa 
tion should reach you before you misconstrue or brood 
upon the statements you see in the papers of A. Burr and 
myself, being here committed, or sent off to Ohio. My 
chief object in going to Philadelphia is, to arrange my 
pecuniary demands upon A. B., though only in the pros 
pect of securing them, and to raise by the friendships of 
Mr. Butler, or Joe Lewis, as much cash as will enable me 
to purchase a dozen slaves, whose hire or labor may give 
us subsistence until we learn the result of our expecta 
tions from Ireland, and support our independence after 
they may fail. I will dispatch my letter through the 
Federal city this evening, but will not close this before 
to-morrow, to collect further intelligence for you. 

All friends of the Chief Justice here are as much dissat 
isfied with his opinion yesterday as Government has 
been with all his former decisions. He is a good man, 
and an able lawyer, but timid and yielding under the 
fear of the multitude, led, as it were, by the vindictive 
spirit of the party in power. But you will console your 
self in the assurance of my wanting nothing, through the 



302 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

support of many friends. And should my obligations, 
under my recognizance, prevent my return to you, as I 
had hoped above, you must yet weather it out, without 
attempting a voyage or a journey which, instead of 
hastening our meeting, would possibly, at this season, 
prevent it forever, in this world. 

October 23d. I shall be off to-morrow or next day, 
with Dr. Commins, etc. He and myself are endeavoring 
to procure some negroes in partnership, upon part credit, 
but I can't answer for our success. I have no hopes of 
learning here, as I expected, the designs of J. ; but if 
they are hostile, I shall find means of effecting my 
wishes, of which I have little doubt. Endeavor with 
Capt. P. to procure us a lodging in his neighborhood; 
it may be very convenient. You will hereafter learn the 
motives of this suggestion, but I shall write more fully 
from Philadelphia. 

Saturday, 24A. I leave this at 5 o'clock to-morrow 
morning, in company with Dr. Commins ; Burr and L. 
Martin follow next day. I shall stop a day at the 
Federal city, to learn the disposition of Government, 
where I have no doubt I shall obtain a release from all 
further demands upon me in a criminal way : but. if I am 
not certified of this, I shall not yet be bereft of resources 
to meet and indemnify you, in as reasonable a space of 
time as you should expect. I have more to do to-night 
than will give me half sleep. Farewell! I will write 
from Philadelphia, if not sooner. 

Your faithful husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT. 



PRIVATE JOURNAL. 303 



CHAPTER XIII. 

[Blennerhassett's Private Journal, kept during the trial, wherein are 
minutely narrated the incidents which occurred from the time 'of his 
arrest, in Kentucky, until his discharge at Richmond.] 

RICHMOND, YA., Aug. 4^, 1807. 
WE set out as usual from Scottsville before day, rode 

twelve miles to breakfast, then proceeded to T 's, 

eight miles on our way, where we rested one hour in ex 
cessive heat; afterward, proceeded to Richmond, where 
we arrived at forty-five minutes past 2, P. M. Distance 

from Lexington, 564 miles. From T ? s, Mr. Meade 

sent a note to Major Scott, the federal Marshal for the 
district of Virginia, to inform him of our approach. We 
traveled this last stage as usual, until we got within 
three-quarters of a mile of Manchester, where Mr. Meade 
left us, at a turnpike gate, and rode off at a quick pace. 

Now Capt. took the command of the party, and 

said to me that it would be proper to observe some order ; 
to which I answered, I had no objection. He then ordered 
Mr. Morton, the High Sheriff of Kentucky, and Mr. Wil 
lis Morgan, to form a file in front, Mr. McCally and Mr. 
David Todd to form another in the rear, directing me to 
ride single between the files, while he took his station in 
front of the whole ; in this order he led the escort with 
the Drisoner, in an easy walk, under a broiling sun, over 



304 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

a road in which I was almost suffocated by the dust, 
owing to a long drought with which the country seemed 
to have been affected, and a smart breeze in our rear. 
During this embarrassment I called to the gentlemen in 
front of me to observe, " that I supposed it was not neces 
sary those in the rear should ride so close to me." They 
did so, probably, from the Captain's having used the 
words " % close order " in forming the procession. Those 
in front, however, Mr. Morton, or Mr. Morgan, answered 
me in the negative ; upon which the rear file fell back a 
few paces. We continued still in the same order, in which 
I endeavored to keep my station, as was assigned me, as 

nearly as possible, until we drew near to M bridge, 

over James river, when the Captain left his station in the 
front and rode back to the rear, I suppose to order them 
to ride closer up, for they immediately afterward did so. 
We now reached the bridge, on which the Captain shook 
hands with Col. Meyo, en passant, and telling him one of 
the gentlemen in the rear would pay the toll, which Mr. 
Todd did very expeditiously, without much deviation 
from his station. We proceeded at the same gait, until 
we entered the Main-street, commonly called the Brick- 
row, where I was disappointed to see no particular notice 
taken of the party, except by a little boy, who called out 
to some of his comrades, " 0, see the troop of horse, but 
they have forgot their colors ! " The walking gait was 
still preserved until we got in sight of the Washington 
tavern, when the Captain was pleased to trot up to the 
house, in which pace we followed him as closely as possi 
ble. On alighting from my horse, I was welcomed by 
Mr. Meade, in the presence of many gentlemen standing 



OLD FRIENDS. 305 

in the portico. He then asked me to go up stairs, ordered 
dinner, etc., after which he delivered me into the custody 
of the Deputy Marshal of the Virginia district, by whom 
I was conducted in a carriage to the Penitentiary, Mr. 
Meade and the Captain accompanying me. In the even 
ing I was visited by Mr. Alston, Mr. Mercer and Mr. 
Randolph; the latter having obligingly tendered me his 
services and advice as a lawyer. Here my apartments 
are large and convenient, but very warm, from the hight 
of the windows preventing a free admission of air. The 
Deputy Marshal, on taking charge of me, read a warrant 
by Judge Marshall, but refused to leave it, or a copy, 
with me. 

"WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 5, 1807. 

I slept until 7 o'clock ; had a light breakfast this morn 
ing from the tavern ; hired a servant at $13 a month, by 
the week, he finding himself; was visited by Mr. Julian 
Dandridge, with whom I used to assist here, seven years 
ago, at the Harmonic Society; by Prichard, the book 
seller, whose hospitality I remember then to have re 
ceived, and who tendered me his best services, reminding 
me of some pecuniary accommodation I had conferred 
upon him, which I had forgotten. Visited again by Mr. 
Alston, who brought me a letter from Col. Burr ; also, by 
Dudley Woodbridge, jun., Edmond Dana, with letters from 
Miller and Col. Gushing, by Mr. John Banks, who re 
minded me of my gold chronometer in his possession, and 
by Mr. Craughton, who conferred great civilities on me 
seven years ago at Fredericksburg, and now warmly ten 
dered me his best services. Mr. Alston repeated orally 
20 



306 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to me the necessity Col. Burr observed in his letter for 
my employing counsel, as the only proper intermedium 
of our communications. I assured him I was very de 
sirous of such aid, but was determined not to strengthen 
my defense, however disastrous the issue of it might 
prove, by drawing from the exigencies and sympathies of 
my family a single dollar to defray its charges. He still 
urged me to write a few lines to Mr. Botts, which I did. 
stating that I was solicitous of the aid of Mr. B.'s talents 
on terms I wished to propose to him in person. On Mr. 
B.'s appearance soon after in my room, I stated to him 
that Col. Burr and Mr. Alston had expressed a desire 
that I would employ him, though they were apprised of 
my determination not to spend a dollar on my defense, 
being a resolution the exigencies of my family imposed 
upon me, but Mr. Alston having assured me Col. Burr 
would arrange the matter with Mr. Botts, I wished Mr. 
B. to believe I should regard the aid of his talents on my 
trial as most beneficial to my interests, and flattering to 
my wishes. Mr. B. handsomely replied to me, by assuring 
me that he would think it dishonorable to withhold his 
professional aid from my inability to make him a pe 
cuniary compensation. I returned, that from the state 
of my aftairs that inability would probably be permanent, 
and again referred him to the contingency of Col. Burrs 
or Mr. Alston's remunerating him on my account, as well 
as on Col. Burr's, as it was in this view, and at their 
special instance I had given him the trouble of calling 
upon me, though I could sincerely assure him that, were I 
in circumstances to remunerate him in a degree propor 
tional to the sense I entertained of his talents, etc., he 



IN PRISON. 307 

would be one of the first counsel I should employ. Mr. 
B. seemed perfectly satisfied, and was pleased to say he 
would, with my leave, bring Mr. Wickham to see me, 
who, he was sure, would be happy to assist me in the 
same way with himself. I thanked this generous and 
enlightened stranger with all that awkward embarrass 
ment with which the impetuosity of gratitude suffused 
my countenance, making every pore of my face an outlet 
to the flow of my heart, which found too narrow an issue 
at my mouth. It will soon appear how necessary it was 
to explain the occasion and manner of my interview with 
Mr. B. I took this opportunity to observe to Mr. Botts, 
that Mr. Edmond Randolph had last evening called upon 
me, and obligingly tendered his advice, by which I said I 
could not presume to suppose Mr. R. meant I should con 
sider him as my counsel, gratuitously engaged to defend 
me on my trial. Mr. Botts was in the act of taking leave 
when I made this remark to him, which prevented my 
distinctly understanding his reply. I was visited this 
evening by my Lexington escort, en masse, who took the 
opportunity to inspect the building and the armory, took 
their grog, and then took leave. Morton, who arrested 
me so rudely, while engaged in conversation with Mrs. 

Jourdan, and Miss Van P 1, at Lexington, endeavored, 

by the most assiduous attentions on the road, to repair 
that outrage, and now, I thought, exhibited in his coun 
tenance every concern for my situation. I find I have 
every liberty allowed me but that of passing from under 
this roof by day, or out of my room by night, the door 
being locked upon me at 8 o'clock, and opened at sunrise. 
I have got a supply of groceries and liquors ; my dinner 



308 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

is furnished by the tavern, and I have every prospect of 
living well. This evening I have inclosed various papers 
to Mr. Alston, showing him how my property has been 
sacrificed on the Ohio, and praying his aid to recover it 
for my children, by virtue of his responsibility for my 
indorsement of Col. Burr's protested bills. Continued 
my labors to comfort my poor wife, by another page of a 
close written letter, and went to bed at midnight. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 6, 1807. 

Woke this morning with severe headache and general 
lassitude ; took a little breakfast, with no appetite. At 
10, A. M., took a small dose of medicine; repeated at 
noon ; had a long conversation with Alston, in which he 
expressed great concern for the embarrassments occa 
sioned me by my indorsements of the bills ; declaring 
that, for my sake, he would do any thing in his power, 
observing, however, that it was impracticable to raise 
money in South Carolina by sale or mortgage of lands ; 
that through his anxiety to have all the protested bills 
taken up, he now had a friend employed in this town, 
endeavoring to raise as much money as would cover all 
the demands ; that I shall learn the result to-day or to 
morrow, which, if successful, would remove all difficul 
ties. I proposed to him an alienation to me on some of 
the holders of the bills of some negroes to be sold at 
Katchez, where, I suggested, he might avail himself of 
the advance they would fetch upon their value in Caro 
lina, and by that means he would probably sink half the 
demands upon him; but after some consideration, he 
stated the value of slaves in Carolina full as high as it is 



HIGGLING. 309 

at Natchez; and at last observed, that his estates needed 
more slaves for their cultivation than he owned. He 
offered, however, to assume all the demands upon me, if 
the creditors will accept one-half, payable with interest, 
next January twelvemonth ; the other half, etc., the 
January following. But my children's property is, and 
will be, irrevocably sacrificed in the mean time. 

Quicquid delirant Reges plectuntur Achivi. 

Mr. A. next referred to a memorandum he had in his 
pocket of some inquiries to be made of me on the part of 
Col. Burr, of which two are remarkable: first, had I 
written, or would I write, to Emmett, to come to the 
trial ? second, in what instance did I intend, when I ob 
served to Mr. Edm. Randolph, that " Col. Burr had 
sometimes been too cautious ; sometimes, too little so ? " 
To the first I answered, " that I had no doubt Emmett's 
friendship for me would bring him hither to assist in my 
defense, if he thought I stood in need of him ; but as I 
was, on the one hand, determined to expend no money in 
my own defense, I was, on the other, equally averse to 
bringing my friend on a journey from his large family, or 
withdrawing his industry from that harvest on which 
alone that family depended for their support ; but could 
I engage Mr. Emmett at a suitable compensation, I would 
write to him forthwith." Mr. A. said, " his expenses 
should be paid." I replied, I could not say what Mr. 
Emmett might understand by the term expenses ; but I 
was sure he would never hand in an account of his 
tavern-bills or traveling charges. I must, therefore, at 



310 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

present, decline to disturb him. Mr. A. was now led by 
some association of ideas to remark, that Messrs. Randolph 
and Botts had signified to Col. Burr or himself, that, when 
they offered their professional services to me, I seemed 
rather to desire to decline them, or consider them as in 
trusive. This evening, Mr. Botts brought Mr. Wickham 
to my room, when I asked Mr. Botts " if he understood 
me in the sense Mr. Alston said he did ? " On the con 
trary, Mr. Botts declared he did not ; nor did he think 
Mr. Randolph did. Mr. Wickham added a few words in 
compliment of my candor, and said all three considered 
themselves voluntarily engaged, without any expectation 
of pecuniary compensation from me. In answer to the 
second inquiry, I informed Mr. Alston that in making 
use of the expressions reported to Col. Burr by Mr. Ran 
dolph, I alluded to no particular instances, but could 
easily cite some. I then instanced the confidence reposed 
by Mr. Burr in General Wilkinson, on which Col. Burr 
had known my opinion long since, and the committal of 
himself to Col. Morgan and sons, both as examples of 
defect of caution on his part, and was proceeding with 
equal ease to call up errors of an opposite nature (God 
knows, I know a hundred, both ways), when I was stop 
ped by Mr. A.'s shaking his head, expressing his assent 
to my remarks on Wilkinson, and interrupting me by 
saying : " Mrs. Blennerhassett had good reason for her 
opinion of Col. Morgan." I was the less scrupulous to 
enter explicitly upon these explanations for the satisfac 
tion of Col. Burr and Mr. A., because I did not feel that 
Col. Burr had ever suffered as yet from any avoidable 



" SERPENT'S TOOTH." 311 

indiscretion of mine ; though I was likely to do so far 
more than I had done already by his errors. I suspected 
that he had sent Mr. Edm. Randolph to deliver me a lec 
ture on caution ; and, above all, I should, least of all ex 
amples I could imagine, wish to emulate the caution Mr. 
A. has exhibited to the world. Him, therefore, I re 
garded as the most improper organ of Col. Burr's wishes ; 
nor was I yet without another motive. I had occasion to 
inform Mr. A., when on the subject of the protested bills, 
that Mr. Barton, who had had an interview here with 
Col. Burr on that business, informed me at Lexington 
that Col. Burr told him I was a bankrupt, not worth a 
dollar, or other words fully of the same import, which 
Mr. Barton protested he would, at any time or place, 
repeat and support. Bankrupt ! Hah ! Who made me 
so? God of retributive justice! That Col. Burr also 
declared to him that he did not believe Mr. Alston had 
executed any writing by which he, Alston, could be bound 
to me. "What ! did his memory, perhaps the most ener 
getic of all his talents, here lose its polish by the abrasion 
of his own calamities? Did he forget that he himself 
drafted that very paper, after having considered another 
which Mr. A. had written as insufficient ? But Mr. Bar 
ton has shown him a copy of the original, and he has 
probably recognized his own composition. 

Received some visits this evening ; could get no tea, 
because Mr. Douglas, the keeper, and Harwood, one of 
his assistants, were out, and another turnkey, with whom 
I had not yet got acquainted, would lock me up at night 
fall. Headache still continued. I went to bed about 10, 
being unable to write.

FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1807. 

Was visited by Mr. Mercer, who staid nearly one hour 
with me ; "begged, on the part of a lady unknown to me, 
who did not wish to have her name mentioned, I would ac 
cept of soups and jellies from her, if they were desired by 
my appetite or state of health. I told Mr. M. my grati 
tude impelled me to take a liberty with the lady, which I 
hoped her goodness would pardon. It was to engrave 
her name on the tablets of my heart, and enable my 
family to consecrate it in their regards. He then men 
tioned Mrs. Carrington. I prayed him to offer, in his 
own manner, a more just return of my sentiments than I 
could express. Soon after, Mr. Ormsby, of Louisville, 
Kentucky, called upon me to show me a letter signed 
H. L., directed to him by General Henry Lee, stating that 
he understood H. B., meaning myself, was friendless in 
this place, and tendering with warmth any services I 
might stand in need of. This offer I declined, charging 
Mr. 0. with a suitable verbal answer of grateful acknowl 
edgments to the General, of whom Mr. 0. cautioned me 
to beware in case of any dealing with him, at the same 
time acquainting me that the character of the General 
was, as I had long before been apprised, that of a man 
equally violent in his friendships and his enmities.' From 
the numerous instances of a violation of private confi 
dence and public faith that have of late disgraced the 
Government and the country, by liberties that have been 
taken or permitted at the Post-offices, I procured, through 
the friendship of Mr. Mercer, the means of sending my 
letters and receiving those from my wife, through K. 



INDIGNANT. 313 

^Taylor, Esq., attorney at law, Alexandria. Closed a long 
letter to my wife, begun as long ago as Tuesday evening, 
on my arrival in this place. Began to brief my case for 
my counsel, of which I finished first folio. Have not 
seen or heard from Mr. Alston, or Col. Burr, to-day. 
Received the papers, and continued this journal until past 
midnight. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1807. 

Overslept myself this morning. Spent more time than 
I could well spare in getting combed and shaved. Read 
the papers, the Federal one stating that they learn my 
arrival here ; that I speak confidently of my innocence, 
and desire a speedy investigation. Those on the other 
side, dropping the "Mister," mention my name in con 
formity to the style of the President; and his Wood 
county myrmidons insinuate that I was caught, as it 
were, fortunately in Kentucky, from which I was brought 
hither under guard, meaning, no doubt, like a felon or 
convict, as I should be. For to-day, my only visitor was 
Mr. Hendren, a lawyer, who resides in Charles City 
county, and has generously offered to come to town, and 
live at his own expense, whenever I will permit him to 
serve me. Mr. H. repeated assurances, which had before 
been made to me by Mr. John Banks and Mr. Ormsby, 
that the jury, not only so far as that part of the panel 
that was returned from "Wood county, but all the rest 
that completed it, from the body of the state, was grossly 
packed, with the exception of not more than two or three ; 
that Col. Burr and myself could not be too much on our 
guard, for he was persuaded that every Democrat, to a 
man, now in this town, was thirsting for our blood, and 



314 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

"John Jourdan," who has returned here to-day from 
Wood county, has told me this evening he has brought 
with him ample evidence of the most damning manoeu 
vres and intrigues that have been practiced in that quar 
ter. Say, Thos. Jefferson ! thou philanthropic messenger 
of peace and liberty to this favored country ! under thy 
administration, are these things unknown to thy tender 
heart, or are they the unhallowed doings of thy worthy 
and industrious partisans, to overcharge or adorn the can 
vass already burdened with the splendor of thy renown ? 
The papers will inform my friends of the progress and 
conduct of the trial of A. Burr ; but perhaps they may 
learn only from these notes, that the issue of it, "whether 
it prove serious or comical, will be the product of error 
in the grand jury that found the treason bills; for two of 
the most respectable and influential of that body, since it 
has been discharged, have declared they mistook the 
meaning of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion as to what 
sort of acts amounted to treason in this country, in the 
case of Swartwout and Ogden ; that it was under the in 
fluence of this mistake they concurred in finding such a 
bill against A. Burr, which otherwise would have prob 
ably been ignored. I am well to-day, and had a keen 
appetite at dinner ; soon after which, Jourdan stepped in, 
but with no particular news regarding my affairs on the 
Ohio. Saw Robinson and Mr. Simpson summoned with 
him, on the part of Col. Burr. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 9, 1807. 

Visited by Prichard, at 9 o'clock, A. M. He stayed 
fully two hours, during which he confirmed many former 



VEXATIOUS DELAY. 315 

accounts given me of the meanness and cowardice of Jef 
ferson's Attorney General, George Hay, whose insolence 
to poor Prichard, some years ago, occasioned P. to throw 
a plate at his head, which terminated the affair, and kept 
Mr. Attorney, ever after, within the bounds of civility. 
P. informed me, negroes now sell in this place at the 
same prices they could be bought at when I was here 
before, seven years ago. He has offered to get me a 
woman, aged about thirty years, with two sons, twelve 
and eight years old, belonging to his sister-in-law, for 
$500. Eh ! Mr. Alston, are negroes so much lower here 
than in South Carolina ? He has also promised to get 
me Molly's three children, two girls and a boy, if the 
owners will part with them, upon like reasonable terms 
as he thinks they will. After P. left me, I continued the 
briefing of my case for my counsel, and completed the 
third folio. If the prosecutors attempt again, to-morrow, 
to put off the trial to a fourth adjournment, I shall not 
think it unwarrantable to begin to suspect they fear to 
advance upon the ground they Ve taken, lest the mines 
of Mexico, or of Tartarus, be sprung upon them. This 
suspicion seems to be somewhat countenanced by the cir 
cumstance of their being correctly informed of the places 
where General Dayton has been for several days, and 
will continue, near this town, without the Marshal, who 
is certainly a vicious partisan, having yet made any 
attempt to disturb him ; while the once redoubted Eaton * 
has dwindled down in the eyes of this sarcastic town, 
into a ridiculous mountebank, strutting about the streets,

under a tremendous hat, with a Turkish sash over colored 
clothes, when he is not tippling in the taverns, where he 
offers up with his libations the bitter effusions of his 
sorrows, in audibly bewailing to the sympathies of the 
bystanders " that he is despised by the Federalists, mis 
trusted by the Democrats, and hen I too long for his fame, 
"too long for his purse," "Quis talia fando temper et a 
lachrymis." 

General Dayton, however, I hear, will offer himself up 
to-morrow, or the next day, and will therefore live rent- 
free like myself, for some time ; but how far reasons of 
State may prevent my partaking of his society here, I can 
not yet tell. It is now 11 o'clock, P. M. I will walk 
about for some time with a fan, and then endeavor to 
sleep, to preserve my strength and appetite. 

MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 1807. 

Rose at 6, A. M., dressed, and walked until 8. Had a 

call from Col. Q r, a violent Democrat, who calls 

every one " Tory " that is not of his own party, and 
talked a great deal about ruining England in the expected 
war with the United States. D. Woodbridge stepped in 
while I was at breakfast, and returned me in frames the 

two drawings presented me by Miss Yanpool at C , 

Col. Meade's place, near Lexington, the day I left that 
town under guard for this city. After Q ' r took leave, 
D. "Woodbridge informed me, he was told some time since 
by Col. Morgan, a subpoena had actually been dispatched, 
a fortnight past, to Natchez for my wife, and he heard 
somebody say last evening, General Wilkinson had assert 
ed the same thing. I immediately addressed a letter to 



IN COURT. 317 

Messrs. Randolph, "Wickham and Botts, stating this in 
telligence, and appealing to their feelings to vindicate, 
from this outrage of party, the rights of a wife and the 
fundamental principles of law and justice. Mr. Mercer 
called in as I was folding up the letter, and kindly took 
upon himself the charge of delivering it for me, as well 
as of inquiring at the Post-office for any letters he could 
bring me from thence. 

I had but half finished the last sentence but one, when 
I heard the voices of strangers coming up stairs, and Mr. 
Douglas entered my room with one of the Deputy Mar 
shals, to invite me to take an airing, that is, to attend the 
court. I was ready in three minutes, and on reaching 
the outside gate, perceived a carriage and two horse- 
guards in waiting. I stepped in, found the air and exer 
cise very agreeable ; was told by the way, I should have 
the trouble to pass through a large crowd, to which I 
answered, " I was indifferent," and soon arrived at the 
capitol, where, without doors, I did not perceive near as 
many people as I expected; within, the court is .held in 
the Hall of the Assembly, which is spacious and hand 
some, and was pretty full at my entrance. I was first led 
by the Deputy Marshal below the bar ; soon after, some 
body else invited me to walk within it, pointing to a 
bench ; and again, I was directed to walk to the opposite 
side, directly in front of the Chief Justice's seat, where I 
sat down near a table at which Col. Burr's counsel sit. 
The court was not yet opened ; I was soon accosted, suc 
cessively, by Messrs. Randolph, Wickham and Botts, who 
all inquired, what occasioned my appearance in court ; I 
said I was ignorant, but supposed for arraignment. The 



318 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

counsel did not know I had been furnished three days 
ago with a copy of the indictment ; but I told them I had 
not yet received a list of the witnesses that might be 
called to testify against me, which I submitted to them, 
whether I was entitled to before arraignment. I then 
entered into a conversation, upon a hint from him in 
French, with Mr. Wickham, who, upon a first address to 
a stranger, possessed a talent of infusing into his manner 
an air of ease and friendly interest, that is truly adapted 
at once to engage the hearts of his acquaintance. Some 
considerable time after the court opened, it was engaged 
in a desultory way, with applications from jurors to be 
excused from serving on the trial of A. Burr, on various 
grounds, and excused. During such occupation, Col. 
Burr entered ; came over to that side where I was, shook 
me by the hand, and smilingly said, he was extremely 
glad to see me indeed. Observe, I had not before heard 
from him since Thursday. The prosecuting counsel 
seemed occupied with those of the defendant, A. Burr, in 
completing those lists of the witnesses, with the places 
of their abode, and agreeing upon some form of an ac 
knowledgment to be made by A. B., that he had been 
duly served with the same, for which the court was pa 
tiently waiting, when Mr. Hay coolly observed, " that it 
might, in the mean time, be as well to arraign Mr. Blen- 
nerhassett;" to which Mr. Botts objected, for want of 
preparation by me and my counsel. Mr. Hay replied, 
that if it was not done to-day, a great deal of time would 
be lost. Mr. B. said he could not help it, it would be im 
proper ; on which Mr. Hay returned, " that I might then 
be remanded," which I soon after solicited, from the 



MR. THOMPSON. 319 

warmth of the place and a wish to get back to my writ 
ing. I therefore left the court, having bowed to the 
bench, under charge of another Deputy Marshal, and 
another gentleman, with whom I returned hither on foot, 
much heated by the walk, about fifteen minutes past 2. 
Saw and saluted many faces on leaving the court ; among 
them, "Win. Lewis, who appeared glad to see me, and in 
quired particularly for my family ; also, David Wallace, 
who arrived yesterday. Dined with less appetite than I 
had yesterday ; oppressed in the evening by the heat of 
the weather ; tried to get cool, by walking and fanning, 
but was so weak I was obliged to lie down on the floor, 
where I slept, I know not how long, until I was awak 
ened by the name of Mrs. Alston, at which I started up, 
as if electrified, and perceived a servant of hers with a 
large present of oranges, lemons and limes. Wrote her, 
in form of a card, three lines of devotion and gratitude, 
seizing the opportunity of inquiring after Alston, who is 
confined to the house, to pray her to let me hear again 
from her to-morrow. Drank tea as usual, at nightfall, 
and was soon after locked up. Through excessive heat, 
I have written the sixth folio of my brief, and will now 
try to sleep, it being 2 o'clock, the llth. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 11, 1807. 

Rose late. Saw Jourdan while at breakfast. He re 
mained all day to copy my brief. Visited in the evening 
by Dav. and Robert Wallace, with P. Howe. Had a 
friendly, sympathizing letter from Mr. Wm. Thompson, a 
lawyer of handsome talents, though a violent Democrat, 
the brother of the author of the Letters of Curtius. 1 



320 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

got acquainted with him at Abington, on the road hither. 
I do not hear any more of Mrs. Alston's intention to 
attend the trial of her father. I hope neither will add 
this to the many indiscretions already committed by him. 
Jupiter might invisibly elude the guards of Danae, but 
the bonne amie of the Col. does not I suppose occasionally 
pass his keepers with the same address. Proh pudor! 
Worked to-day chiefly on my brief, of which I have to 
night, past 12, entered on the eleventh folio. 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 12, 1807. 

Rose at 7, A. M. Was visited by Dav. Meade, who 
tells me himself and the guard that escorted me hither 
from Kentucky will be allowed only one-half of what 
they expected, namely, instead of 10, only 5 cents per 
mile for coming and returning ; and he expects his bill 
against the United States will not be paid under two 
years after his having advanced his money for them : also, 
he understands the Marshal, Major Scott, will not pay 
Burr's witnesses, while he answers all the calls of those 
on the part of the prosecution. Does a culprit, then, 
. with an empty purse, look in vain to the provisions of the 
Constitution, which declare " that the accused shall have 
compulsory process to enable him to enforce the attend 
ance of his witnesses ;" and may he be hanged for want 
of money, as well as of innocence? I fear the murmurs 
of agents and returning officers will be so widely diffused, 
that no one will undertake to serve subpoenas for me on 
witnesses, however material to my defense, while I will 
not lay out a dollar for promoting its success. A consid 
erable fall of rain last night and this morning has very 



FALSE WITNESS. 321 

agreeably lowered the temperature of the air, the high 
degree of which has, for a week past, been so very op 
pressive. I have had, by Mr. Meade, another advance 
from female humanity. Mrs. Chevalier, wife of the 
French Consul, has solicited by him my acceptance of 
any refreshments or delicacies she could send me. Read 
the three papers published here, of which the " Inquirer," 
incorrectly, and rather impertinently, notices the occasion 
of my counsel's declining to permit me to be arraigned 
last Monday. Was interrupted by idle visitors, desirous 
of gratifying their curiosity to survey my countenance 
and quarters. One of them, a rejected juryman from 
Wood county, of the name of Morrison, with whom I 
am not acquainted ; the others, strangers to me, and came, 
like many others before them, without recommendation, 
to solicit employment of serving subpoenas on witnesses. 
Had a friendly visit in the evening from Mr. Fowler, in 
company with Jourdan, and procured, through a friend, 
copies of the depositions, before the grand jury, of Peter 
Taylor, Jacob Albright, and David Wallace. The first 
having sworn that I told him we would stab all those that 
went with us to get land, and would not go on our expe 
dition ; the second, that General Tupper arrested me on 
the " Island " the night I left it, from which I effected 
my escape by my friends directly presenting six guns at 
the General ; and the third, that I offered him the post 
of Surgeon General, if he would embark in the expedi 
tion. " God of Truth and Justice !" avenge such mur 
derous villainies in mercy ; and then, my beloved wife, 
behold and adore a guardian Providence, that ordains the 

conviction of perjury to issue in the same breath from

322 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the lips of falsehood accusing the innocent. Mr. Fowler 
assures me Mr. Hay begins to feel sick of the business, 
and doubts not a nolle prosequi will be entered on the rec 
ords, on Burr's acquittal of the treason. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 13, 1807. 

Rose at half-past 6 ; walked, dressed and breakfasted. 
Had a friendly letter from Prichard, requesting me to 
command his heart and hand ; also a long letter, sent by 
Phelps, but lastly from Col. Burr, from Tom Neale, con 
fessing, at last, that 'twas he bought Eansom, whom he 
will return to my wife or to myself at the same price he 
gave for him. Heard by letter from Col. Burr, in answer 
to one I wrote to him, covering another for him to for 
ward, if he wished it, to Mr. Hendren, requesting him to 
come to town, to assist Burr with his knowledge of the 
jurymen. Heard that Alston is to-day confined to his 
bed. Visited by David Meade, with two gentlemen of 
his acquaintance, summoned as talesmen, or on another 
venire pro defectum juratorum, on the last. To one of 
these, finding he was acquainted with Will. Thompson, I 
was fortunate, in procuring an opportunity, connected 
with the subject of conversation, to show Mr. T.'s hand 
some letter to me. As this party were taking leave, 
Messrs. Wickham and Botts appeared at the door ; they 
seemed pleased to find the ennui of my confinement 
relieved by company ; sat half an hour, during which 
they told me, they understood the Hendersons would 
swear much against me, but seemed to think with me, 
their story could bear but little on either count of the 
indictment. They concurred in opinion, that I should 



WILKINSON. 323 

not hurry my trial, but should rather wait until party 
prejudice was more allayed, and the great crowd of wit 
nesses now in town somewhat dispersed. They confirmed 
to me the fact of a subpoena having been actually issued 
for my wife, her name being one on the list of witnesses 
furnished to A. Burr. My complaints on this head they 
seemed to regard as irremediable, because A. Burr is not 
her husband. In how many instances is the letter of the 
law at war with common sense, and its own principles ? 
Are not all accomplices principals in treason? are not 
Burr and myself charged by exactly similar indictments 
with the same overt acts, at the same place ; and, conse 
quently, can the same jury, if I should choose it, or any 
other in my case, shut their eyes to testimony upon which 
Burr may be by possibility convicted? I hinted these 
ideas to these generous and accomplished advocates ; 
their silence seemed only to reply, sed ita lex scripta est. 
They, however, were of opinion that the helpless state 
of the children would justify her non-compliance with 
the summons. The moment they left me, therefore, I 
dispatched a few lines to her to that effect, which I hope 
were time enough at the office to go by this evening's 
mail. The slow march of the trial, I am told, has put 
Wilkinson out of all patience. He has been heard to 
swear in his wrath, that if Burr is not h anged, he cares 
not how soon himself were stretched on the same gal 
lows. Mr. Botts said he saw the " Querist" at old Hen 
derson's, and will advise my presence in court when the 
sons are produced to give their testimony. Progressed 
with my brief, of which I entered on the thirteenth folio, 
bringing the narrative of the case, so far as I hope I can 



824 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

prove it, down to the period of my first interview with 
Graham, on Burr's affairs at Marietta, in last November. 
I learn or conclude by letters I have received, that old 
Richard Neale and James Wilson must be in town ; I 
have as yet seen neither. Jourdan tells me, Burr lives in 
great style, and sees much company within his gratings, 
where it is as difficult to get an audience as if he really 
were an Emperor. If these things be so well founded, as 
is the hint in last Tuesday's notes, I fear Wm. Thompson 
is sketching his portraits of the characters connected 
with the trial too far West, not to lose some lines of cer 
tain features that would not escape his pencil if he 
were here. 

FRIDAY, AUGUST 14, 1807. 

"Went down to the kitchen after breakfast, in this wing 
of the building, my servant having gone to town to beg 
of one of the cooks there to request a keeper to bring 
the barber to shave me. Cooks were preparing the din 
ner for the convicts now confined here, to the number of 
about 130. This meal, I learned, generally consisted of 
three-quarters of a pound of meat, one and a half pints of 
soup, and one pint of corn-meal dough, which suffers by 
baking a diminution of one quarter of the weight. The 
breakfast, the only other meal allowed in the twenty-four 
hours, consists of the like quantity of the same sort of 
bread, and half a gill of molasses, diluted with a pint of 
water. "Not having before spoken of the police of this 
establishment, I will now mention what has fallen under 
my own observation regarding it. The convicts are con 
fined, for various terms of years, according to their several 



PRISON DISCIPLINE. 325 

offenses, for which the heaviest sentence is, I believe, for 
the space of eighteen years. They are kept to labor in 
the respective trades or occupations they had been bred 
to, with no allowance of rest on any day, but Sunday, 
except during meals, being set to work at daylight, and 
leaving off at sunset. The present keeper is a smart, in 
telligent man, who tells me, before he came here, the 
value of the annual labor of the prisoners did not exceed 
$5,000 ; the expenses being nearly, as at present, $11,500. 
But he speaks confidently of raising the former, in his first 
year, to $14,500. I believe great diligence will be neces 
sary in him to effect it. The men have not now, as under 
his predecessor, the benefit of any work they might try to 
do, over and above the limits of their task. Mr. Douglas 
assigns two curious reasons for discontinuing that little 
indulgence to these wretches ; 1st, that it was found to 
occasion expense to the State, by encouraging some folks 
to commit and confess small offenses, in order to get 
boarded here gratis for six or twelve months, when they 
would be turned out, with a sum of money in their 
pockets, for their extra labor during their confinement, 
which they would soon renew in v the same way; 2d, 
that those confined for a long term of years would prob 
ably soon debilitate themselves through this stimulus, to 
an increase of industry, by which their maintenance 
would become a dead charge, without any return to the 
State. The stimuli of Mr. D., therefore, or his superiors 
through him, are dark confinement in the cells, and the 
cow-skin, with short allowance of bread and water, which 
is not very well calculated, to prevent the last evil the 
debility now sought to be avoided. My unfortunate 



326 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

barber, I hope, fell on a lucky day for his punishment, 
well or ill deserved, for I was soon told in the kitchen 
that he was in the cells ; but expressing my concern for 
the poor fellow's misfortune, one of the cooks stepped 
out, I suppose, to signify to the proper authority the ma 
turity of my beard, no doubt, rather than the expression 
of my sorrow; and, in ten minutes, Yaun was in my 
room with his whole apparatus. This Yaun, my friends, 
is only here for eighteen years, merely for cutting his 
wife's throat, with precisely the same sort of instrument 
with which he operates most delicately on mine, every 
other day. Nor do the largest cities I have ever lived in 
boast an artist, in his line, that should supplant him in 
my favor. The physiognomy of his countenance, and the 
steadiness of his hand, with the keenness of his instru 
ment, admirably correspond with the firmness and sensi 
bility of his heart would to Heaven I could add, its 
purity. But hideous jealousy entered there, and goaded 
this wretch to murder and madness. A gentleman of 
Petersburg, who called in last evening with David Meade, 
assured me that Yaun, on the day he killed his wife, sat 
at his door for an hour or two, showing the bloody razor 
to the passengers in the street, and telling them how he 
had used it. The gentleman declared, had he been of 
the jury, he should not have concurred in the conviction. 
This convict is black, was born free, lived in good circum 
stances, has been to Europe, and always supported an 
excellent character. Poor Yaun ! the gloom of thy soul 
is now as dark as thy countenance ; but yet may one ray 
of Divine mercy enlighten it ! Thou shalt still shave me. 
Col. Burr wrote me to-day, that he was so surrounded 



NEW VISITORS. 327 

by company he could not make up his mind upon a com 
munication I made him by letter, of which he said he 
perceived all the importance and advantages. I wrote to 
him to summon Henderson, the father, for reasons that 
will appear by my brief, urged the advantage that would 
result from my cross-examining all the witnesses (that I 
knew, particularly the Hendersons, which may be pro 
duced against him, if in my present character I could be 
allowed to act, during his trial, as an agent or advocate 
for him ; or if that should not be permitted, that I should 
at least be in court when such witnesses appear. I also 
submitted to him the expediency of one of our counsel 
seeing my brief, so far as I had written it. He added in 
his letter that one of them should call upon me for that 
purpose, and to confer on other matters this evening. 
But I have received no such visit, and must confess I am 
rather led to ascribe my disappointment less to the negli 
gence of the advocate than to that of the client. The 
vivacity of his wit, and the exercise of his proper talents, 
now constantly solicited here in private and public exhi 
bition, while they display his powers and address at the 
levee and the bar, must engross more of his time than he 
can spare for the demands of other gratifications. Man 
is prone to what St. Pierre aptly names the harmony of 
contrast, in which the mind and the eye are as much de 
lighted in physics and in ethics as the ear is in music. 
My reflections will perhaps borrow from this principle 
hereafter, in attempting to do more justice, in expression 
of character, to a third portrait of an original, so differ 
ently appearing to my regards at Richmond and on the 
Mississippi. Was visited this morning by Belknap and 



328 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

P 1; the latter, one of the most active in seizing the 

boats and provisions at Marietta, last December ; also by 
D. Woodbridge, who read my brief, but to whom, as well 
as to every one else that calls upon me, I never speak on 
the subject of evidence yet, or hereafter to be, given by 
them on these trials. Had a very friendly letter from 
Col. Gushing, lamenting my situation, and assuring me 
of every exertion of his friendship to serve me; another, 
from Thos. JSTeale, exactly to the same effect as his last ; 
also a very friendly one from Mr. John Banks, accompa 
nying a present from Mrs. Banks, of two bottles of cor 
dials, and a large cake. Visited by Alston, this being 
the first day he could venture out in a carriage. He says 
appearances every day strengthen the expectation of 
Burr's acquittal on both bills, Hay having been heard 
to say, out of court, he does not think he will be able to 
substantiate the charges. It is believed, however, a mo 
tion will be made to the Court, on the acquittals, but be 
rejected, to transmit us to other districts for trial, accord 
ing as evidence may appear or be procured, as may be 
contended to implicate our conduct as treasonable else 
where out of this district. Douglas has also heard Duane 
confess, that he, too, is fearful Burr must be acquitted. 
Had this evening an obliging visit, and one hour's inter 
esting French conversation with Col. de Pestre, who in 
formed me his brother-in-law, a promising young ma.n 
of various merit, had been turned out of his place as 
Clerk in the "War Office, because he could not accuse the 
Col. of Burr-ism ; and afterward, some honorable friends 
of the Government had the delicacy to insinuate how 
handsomely the Col. might be provided for in the army, 



329 

if his principles or engagements were not adverse to the 
administration. The Col. replied, that he understood the 
hint, hut it neither suited his honor nor character to serve 
in such employment. Wrote to Col. Gushing, requesting 
him to forward to me an inventory of all my effects that 
have heen sold under attachments, and all my negroes, 
to my wife, or Col. Scott, or Mr. Harding, at Natchez, 
for her. Have not worked to-day on my "brief, from a 
prospect held out by many of my discharge on Burr's 
acquittal. Chatted as usual in the evening with Douglas, 
and having left a letter I began to Miller, for to-morrow, 
continued this diary until midnight. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 15, 1807. 

Half-past 8, P. M. Have not, during the forenoon, seen 
a face, but that of my servant Billy, who, by the comfort 
I derive from his remarkable neatness and assiduity, my 
wife will not think undeserving of mention in this diary, 
which I have resolved to keep only for her gratification. 
Every one is probably at court, where this is a day of 
some interest, as the jury will probably be impanneled. 
Have done nothing but walk, and read the papers, my 
face continuing very sore with a disagreeable eruption. 
"Will now finish my letter, begun yesterday, to Miller, and 
conclude the notes of to-day after tea, by which time I 
may probably collect something worthy of notice from 
Jourdan, whom I hourly expect. While at dinner, Mr. 
Ellis called in to know if I could yet inform him when I 
might want him to serve subpoenas for me, otherwise he 
should soon leave town, seeing no prospects of getting 
any money from Col. Burr, against whom he has a de 



330 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

mand of about eleven dollars, for a boat and cargo sold 
him in October last on tbe Ohio. B., it seems, has dis 
posed of all such claims, by a declaration, it is said, he 
made in court, before my arrival, of his being a bankrupt. 
But in emptying his strong-box, which seems to have 
lost all his treasures as quickly as those that took wing 
from Pandora's, he has, I am told, like that goddess, 
closed the lid time enough to prevent the escape of that 
hope on which some favored dependents may yet mort 
gage to him their future services and the property of 
their children. It would even baffle the acuteness, and 
exhaust the deliberation, of our worthy Harding, to 
estimate the amount of this treasure, or conceive the 
structure of the debenture by which it is secured; I must 
therefore explain both. Know, then, that it has been 
whispered to me, with the important gravity so confiden 
tial a communication required, that the sum is $50,000 ; 
the security, a claim upon Government for the damages 
sustained by the culprit now trying for his life, but who 
will probably obtain his acquittal of the treason with 
more ease than he can procure one on another charge 
recorded against him in Kentucky, of having robbed the 
Western country of $1 00,000, to say nothing of the ab 
surdity of suing the United States in the face of a 
positive statute. As I was closing my letter to Miller, 
Jourdan stepped in with Rob. Nicholas, a Democrat, 
furious, keen and selfish, in chase of Alston, to secure and 
hasten the payment of bills, protested and indorsed by 
me to Sanders, to amount, with charges, etc., of fl 0,000, 
for which I will never give more than my bones, and the 
holder believing me determined, now depends on Alston's 



QUEER CHARACTER. 331 

responsibility to me, which I have transferred to him. 
To-morrow, I shall be visited by Mr. Edmond Randolph, 
on the part of Sanders, and on my own business ; I an 
ticipate the conference with much interest. Jourdan is 
quite desolate and dispirited by the treatment of B., of 
which he will give me particulars to-morrow. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1807. 

Rose late this morning, very ill, but satisfied I was 
affected by no influence of confinement, or the place; a 
severe headache, under which I 've all day labored, pro 
ceeding only from a derangement of the stomach, to 
which I am frequently subject. While at breakfast, I 
was visited by Mr. P., a merchant of consideration here, 
who had not before called upon me, for which he apolo 
gized, and in whom I admired here, in the spring of 
1 800, the most amiable manners, with a fine musical taste, 
and handsome execution on the violin, he and myself, 
during my stay, being the principal performers in the 
Harmonic Society. My worthy friend Prichard led the 
way, as much heated by the warmth of his friendship as 
of his two miles' walk, bringing with him also Wood, the 
late editor of the Atlantic World, a paper, which is now 
extinct, and may be truly said to have been the last faint 
effort, save these trials, of expiring Burr-ism under the 
relentless fury of Democracy. Wood is a singular look 
ing man, with a countenance expressive of great oddity, 
if not of genius ; of few words, with embarrassed man 
ner, but said to be skilled in mathematics. His appear 
ance altogether inspired some interest to know him 
better, and he will, by my desire, enable me to improve 



332 THE LLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

our acquaintance. I was agreeably occupied with this 
party until General Tupper appeared ; the news of his 
arrival in town, "brought me yesterday evening by Jour- 
dan, must have caused some little mental uneasiness last 
night and this morning, of which I was unable to render 
an account to myself. This intelligence could not reach 
my ears without arriving in the same instant at my heart, 
where it was at once amalgamated with all my hopes and 
anxiety for my family. With what rapidity did I calcu 
late, over and over, and conclude that I must hear from 
Natchez by the General. I had written to my wife from 
the Chickasaw Nation, to direct to me under cover to the 
General. I hardly permitted myself to conclude an inter 
change of salutations with him when I eagerly inquired 
for a letter; he had none, and he left home^as late as the 
5th instant. But a few more mails from Lexington and 
Marietta, without the blessing of a letter, and I shall en 
deavor to prepare myself for more awful trials than the 
death-warrant of a wicked or a jealous Government. 
General Tupper's conversation, which lasted about one 
hour with me, was very interesting, both to my curiosity 
regarding the intelligence I could derive from him on my 
own account, and my admiration of that honorable inde 
pendence he will yet make the Government feel more of, 
on his part, when they wish or desire, from the experience 
they have already had of his temper. It seems much of 
the artifice of intrigue, on the part of Government or 
their runners, has been put in requisition to endeavor 
to mold the General's disposition in the temper of the 
present prosecutions. He has next encountered attempts 
upon his honor indirectly, to induce him in some degree 



DISAPPOINTMENT. 333 

to countenance the testimonies of Taylor and Albright to 
the facts of his having arrested me, with my rescue and 
escape from him, mentioned 12th instant ; outrages upon 
his character and feelings, which he has repelled with 
that disgust and contempt suggested by his honor, but 
not without thereby incurring, what, until then, the con 
servators of Jeffersonian fame never thought of, insinua 
tions of his concern, and threats to involve him in the 
pains and penalties of the conspiracy. Either before or 
after this analysis of the stuff, which would not take the 
dye, proposed, it was politely signified to him, that al 
though he had been recognized as a witness, on the part 
of the United States, the prosecutors, in kind considera 
tion of the inconvenience another journey might put him 
to, would dispense with his further attendance. He said, 
however, he would return were he obliged to travel on 

his hands and knees. He also tells me, Doctor "W is 

alarmed at my presence here to confront him, when he 
shall dare to offer such testimony again as he has ven 
tured before the grand jury, and is terrified, for he is no 
doctor, at the thoughts of being examined publicly by 
those who are of that profession, to prove he is not one. 
See my notes of 12th instant, and it will appear how 
properly I wanted to fill the place of Surgeon-General in 
the expedition ; but General Tupper says, he knows a 
person to whom W. said I was jesting with him when I 
spoke of his going with me as Surgeon-General. I have 
not been gratified with the visit I expected to-day with 
so much interest from Mr. Randolph, but have had a 
long one from Alston, which was taken up chiefly with 
the subject of an arrangement of the demands of Sanders 



334 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and Miller; the agency of Nicholas has been so tar 
effective as to induce Alston to offer to take a journey 
forthwith to South Carolina to try to raise the money, 
leaving Mrs. A. here until his return. He can not offei 1 
hopes of the success of this attempt, and no final adjust 
ment, I believe, will be effected, but by the opinion and 
advice of Mr. Randolph. Mr. Craughton called this 
evening, after a severe walk of three miles, and remained 
about two hours. 

MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1807. 

This is a black Monday indeed with me, whether the 
"cloudiness of my mind or of the sky makes it appear 
such. I feel well to-day, and took breakfast with some 
appetite, during which Col. de Pestre entered, and kept 
up an interesting conversation with me until noon, which, 
from the complete coincidence of our opinions on certain 
characters, and the reflections arising from the notes we 
had to compare on our past interest, and connection with 
them, could not much tend to fortify me for encountering 
the new mortifications occasioned me by a letter I have 
just received from my estimable friend, Jos. S. Lewis, in 
his private capacity, informing me that the house of 
which he is the head, had, in consequence of attachments 
served on my funds, my last pecuniary resource of my 
poor family in their hands, been obliged to dishonor all 
the bills I had drawn, that were presented for acceptance 
since the 20th of last January, the day such , attachments 
were served, at suit of the Kentucky Insurance Company 
and Lewis Sanders, of Lexington. What discredits and 
embarrassments the return of bills I have drawn at 



DISTRESS. 335 

Natchez, to amount of 700 or 800, will occasion my 
afflicted wife, I fear to estimate. Every day's trial seems 
to inflict a new wound upon my heart, or some part of it 
that has not bled for my wife and children ; my own suf 
ferings have long since destroyed the tone, and established 
the apathy, of every nerve that vibrated to the first im 
pulses of the perfidy and injustice that, by their continued 
action, since the beginning of last October to the present 
hour, have relieved my mind from all care for the dura 
tion or issue of my confinement. I have just dispatched 
a letter to Alston, requesting to see him, and another to 
Pri chard, desiring him to retain, or, if disposed of, to try 
and take up a small bill I drew on Philadelphia a few 
days since for $100. Joe Lewis tells me he will honor 
Harding's bills, drawn on himself for $500, in considera 
tion of my wife's situation. ! my wife, we thought we 
were serving a P . . . . , and have been the dupes of an 
advocate. De Pestre has justly taken up the ideas sug 
gested in my notes of last Friday. This generous foreigner 
has narrowed his means of maintaining a large family, 
besides some orphans, to the amount of $5,000, for which 
he has not been even thanked. I hear Alston's carriage, 
and must now close, but for what purpose ? to hear a re 
petition of the same professions of concern already made 
me, to which is added, however, an offer to go to Caro 
lina, in two or three days, to try to raise some money, the 
success of which, however, I must understand, is very 
problematical. What could I reply to the professions of one 
of the richest men in the Union, offering to assume these 
demands, ready to sell or mortgage, but yet unable to get 
the money I never used a cent of, but for which the cries 



336 THE BLENNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

of rapacious creditors rend the walls of my prison ah ! 
that would be indifferent to me, did I not fear they are 
loud enough to reach and swell that heart that will echo 
them back to mine. For what purpose could I desire to 
see him again on this business, but to make the last sacri 
fice I had to offer ; alas ! I once thought it impossible ; I 
blush to name it, to humble the pride of integrity before 
that of wealth to solicit his charity. I have thus sought 
relief through the storm by every effort of skill or dili 
gence I could make, until, wearied and exhausted, I have 
set down in the humility of my heart, to drift perhaps to 
that shore where the mercy of Heaven will recompense 
me, in the participation of the rewards prepared for the 
fortitude and virtues of a wife I have been so long 
blessed with. It is a relief to my heart to fill a whole 
page with a single sentence. The flood of my sorrows is 
too copious to suffer the artificial breaks and pauses of 
critical rules. My wife will feel this, if no one else can. 
I wrote a very long letter to Joe Lewis, which I immedi 
ately began when Alston left me, to acquaint him that 
bills with my indorsements, on account of which one of 
the attachments had been served on his house, as my 
garnishee had long since been paid by Alston's agent, 
Mr. Sam. Allen, of Philadelphia ; that I had, in addition 
to the arrangement I made with Sanders at Lexington, 
Kentucky, a prospect of making further arrangements 
here, through Alston, with Rob. Nicholas, the agent, and 
Mr. Edmond Randolph, the lawyer of Mr. Sanders, by 
which I should, I expected in a few days, have the attach 
ment at suit of Sanders taken off, and in the mean time, 
until I could see Mr. Randolph, which I could not do 



WHO WROTE IT ? 337 

to-day before the mail closed, I hoped Mr. L. would be 
lieve his house would not be proceeded against as my 
garnishee, and whatever obstruction to their currency 
the little resources I yet possessed through his house in 
Philadelphia were incumbered with, would be removed. 
I have, to-night, also written to Mr. Randolph, to request 
him to call upon me to-morrow, before court opens. 
Speaking to-day, while Alston was here, before Col. 
McKee, of what was doing in court, whither I wrote to 
Alston to come to me, A. said, they left Hay stating 
the case, on the part of the prosecution, damned the 
speaker, and declared he would whip a son of his, were 
he only twelve years old, that could not make a better. 
This led me to praise a pamphlet, entitled "Agrestis," 
which Alston yesterday brought me, being two letters on 
Wilkinson's proceedings at Tew Orleans, which for its 
arrangement and strength, as well as for some imagery 
of the language, I observed, would not be unworthy of a 
Curran, at the same time inquiring who was the author. 
A. said that was not known. I then repeated the ques 
tion to Col. McKee, who said it was a friend of ours ; at 
least Mr. A. was suspected. I mention this trifling occur 
rence for the sake of observing that Alston was now 
silent, thereby appropriating to himself the merit of the 
book, which his wife, I have no doubt, might produce ; 
for by the title-page of the second edition printed here, it 
appears the former, or first edition, was published in 
South Carolina, or else it has proceeded from some other 
genius of much mind and erudition; but to suppose 
Alston the author would be preposterous ; obscurity may 

consistently veil the parentage of Hercules, but it would 

22 



338 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

be ridiculous to suppose him the offspring of a dwarf. 
Take this trait and test it by the fact. There is a pro 
vincial phrase or two in the pamphlet which I will keep, 
that proves it first saw the light at New Orleans. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1807. 

It may easily be conceived how difficult it must be for 
one in the state of mind in which I closed my notes of 
the heavy hours of yesterday, to fall into that oblivious 
repose, through sleep, which easily ensues upon the ces 
sation of ordinary labor of body or mind, and enables us, 
by recreation, to perform the task of misfortune allotted 
for the morrow. Accordingly, I did not find my bed 
what it always proves to the peasant or the mariner, the 
grave of care. The tumult of my mind had so inflamed 
my body, that irritation on the surface could not be 
allayed, while trouble reveled within. I was restless, for 
I was sick at heart, and slept not soundly until toward 
morning. Yet I rose betimes, and had an early visit 
from Mr. Randolph, who called upon me, in pursuance 
of my request to him by letter of last night. I stated to 
him my embarrassment, by Mr. Sanders attaching the 
only remaining funds that were tangible, and insufficient 
for the support of my family ; observing, that if Mr. S. 
did not withdraw the attachment, which I hoped Mr. 
Randolph would forthwith, as S.'s lawyer, persuade his 
agent, Mr. Nicholas, to do, I should consider my arrange 
ments at Lexington with Mr. S., to secure and settle his 
demands through Mr. Alston, as abrogated. This seemed 
to engage his reflections ; but I was sorry soon to find he 
had the indelicacy, not only to inquire what was the 



CANDOR ! 339 

amount of my funds in the hands of Messrs. Jos. S. Lewis 
and Co., but even to tell me that if a sum of $1,000, or 
even $500, could be got immediately for Nicholas and 
Sanders, who, he knew, wanted money, such an expe 
dient, he rather believed, would tend to give effect to 
some arrangement into which Mr. Alston might be in 
duced to enter ; adding, as he was taking leave, " that I 
knew how much a little ready cash helped these sort of 
things forward." I had before observed to Mr. R. that 
he must know now, from the nature of my financial em 
barrassments, detailed to him in these transactions, how 
little I could presume on counsel I could not remunerate, 
Before he left me, he said, Burr has an excellent jury, on 
the whole, with the exception of Parker alone, who, he 
acknowledged, is a worthy, honorable man, but a violent 
Jeffersonian partisan. I expressed my surprise at Burr's 
accepting him, after he had avowed in court as strong 
prejudices as some who had been rejected. This indis 
cretion on Burr's part he censured. He then told me 
Hay was very weak yesterday in stating the case, and he 
had no doubt of an acquittal ; but to save time and labor, 
he very much wished the Chief Justice should concur in 
opinion with the counsel on the defense, who yesterday 
contended, in a lengthy argument with their opponents, 
that no evidence of intentions should be gone into until 
overt acts had been first proven. How the court have 
decided I shall know in the morning. I now soon dis 
patched a note to Alston, and fortunately continued 
reading Agrestis until I heard his carriage-wheels, which 
seemed to rattle in my ears ; " read on " until after he had 
entered the room ; i. e., a thought struck me that possi- 



340 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

bly he might have had something to do in the compo 
sition, and I might do more with him, through his van 
ity of authorship, than I had yet been able to effect 
through any other channel. Admirable ! cried I, before 
I answered his salute ; he smiled " what ! " said he, 
" Agrestis, are you pleased with that little thing? "Well, 
I did not care to notice it yesterday ; but I will now tell 
you in confidence, 't was I wrote it." I then pointed out 
to him an image or two, particularly one in the first let 
ter, of Justice, surrounded by the laws, in the sanctuary 
of her temple, poising in their presence tlie balance with 
her own hand, which, I said, would be a fine subject for 
the relief, alto relievo ; while the stations of her executive 
officers, assigned them without the sanctuary, might beau 
tifully form the intaglio, or back-ground, of a good piece 
of sculpture. Here I threw down the book, which he as 
readily took up, to descant on other merits it possessed, 
or point out errors of the press; all of which engaged 
my most profound attention. The organ now wound 
up ; I lost no time to try upon it the tune my heart first 
called for ; how do you think it went ? To admiration ! 
the instrument was now so much improved ; the piece, so 
often tried on it before, was now not only performed in 
half the time it used to be, but was worth double the 
money it would bring yesterday. In plain English, in 
stead of paying one-half the money next January twelve 
months, and the other half the January following, ac 
cording to his utmost powers, to-day he was tuned up to 
the incredible power of paying the whole, not indeed to 
day, but next April twelve months. Who knows yet but 
a judicious combination of discords to be selected from 



ASPIRATION. 341 

the letter to Pinkne}^ with some more of the melody of 
Agrestis, might produce a harmony which, if it can not 
move the oaks, may still solicit the responsive cadence of 
the dollars? He left me with animated assurances of 
seeing Nicholas to-day, and myself again upon the "busi 
ness, not, however, without some pretty simpers about 
Mr. Randolph's hint of the $500, which he regarded as 
soliciting a douceur for Nicholas; but even that, he 
hinted, in the suavity of his self-complacency, would not 
be impossible, when I assured him it should go in part 
of the demand. I have had two or three reasons to-day 
of lightening my heart of the load that oppressed it yes 
terday. After Mr. Randolph left me, I walked about, 
invoking the saving providence of Heaven over my wife 
and children ; secondly, better prospects opened to me, 
from my interview with Alston ; and, thirdly, the sincere 
pleasure I felt in writing to another Eugenius, as dear to 
me as the first was to Yorick, to communicate to Hard 
ing a transcript of my notes of yesterday, and a short 
letter of to-day, to enable him to observe the better under 
what part of the tottering fabric of my affairs he may set 
the firm prop of his care and friendship for my family 
a service in which, I feel, he will not dally. The regards 
of my wife may one day give him a perusal of these 
notes, as a supplement to his comments on "Agrestis," 
which I have also sent him. I feel no tedium loci, and 
have no want but that of letters. Cock-crow announces 
the morn. Grant, God ! it brings health to my family ! 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 10, 1807. 
Saw Dud. Woodbridge, before breakfast, who told me 



342 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Eaton, Truxton, Taylor, and Albright were yesterday 
examined on the trial. This intelligence has fretted me, 
because I find Burr disregards the caution I gave him, to 
have me present during the examination of the witnesses 
I knew, as they should be produced against him. I have 
heard he alters the notes of his counsel, increased yester 
day by the addition of Mr. Lee, and for the most part 
marks out the course they pursue on his defense. I hope 
his negligence of the suggestions I have made to him 
will not furnish more cause of repentance than he is 
already burdened with. Hay, having again called for my 
arraignment, and Mr. Botts having, I am told, said he 
would try to be ready by Saturday, I must again revert 
to my labors on my brief, which I shall resume this even 
ing. The Chief Justice has, I think properly, allowed 
the prosecutors to follow their own course in adducing 
their evidence, provided they ofFer none of any -other 
treason than what is laid in the indict. It will appear, 
from a correct report of the trial, how far Hay contends 
that the doctrine of constructive treason is law in this 
country. How candid he is ; and what a virulent dispos 
ition McRae manifests to insinuate bias in the court to 
ward the accused. Mr. John Banks brought me, this 
morning, a paper containing Bollman's long letter to 
Duane, respecting B.'s communication to the President, 
which, if not quite a justification of the writer, settles 
however, forever, the honor and good faith of Jefferson. 
I have not seen Alston, according to my expectation and 
his promise ; the general interest and curiosity engaged 
at the capitol must suspend all other concerns. This 
evening General Tupper tells me that Hay boasts of hav- 



TEDIUM. 343 

ing a number of witnesses to establish the credit of Al 
bright. Eternal Justice, then, support my innocence of 
the facts he has ventured to swear against me, until I shall 
appear before thy tribunal, where the vicious shall only 
testify to their own crimes. General Tupper has also a 
suspicion that Meiggs may venture to injure his credit as 
a witness ; but the slightest attempt of that sort shall ex 
hibit Meiggs branded in the next papers as a liar and a 
coward. Eaton's manner and delivery in giving his evi 
dence is highly extolled in the two Democratic papers, 
the Argus and Inquirer; but I am better informed he 
strutted more in buskin than usual on that occasion, and 
the effect was as diverting to the whole court as it prob 
ably was beneficial to the defense. Still, Douglas, who is 
pretty regular in his evening visits to me, or to my grog 
and cigars, tells me Burr is as cheerful as ever, though he 
can not feel insensible to the advantage the prosecutors 
have taken, in framing the indictment in a manner to 
correspond in its form with the substance of the opinion 
given by Chief Justice Marshall, in the cases of Bollman 
and Swartwout, and the industry they practice to train 
and back their witnesses to support it. But as a jockey 
might restore his fame in the course, after he had injured 
it on the tight-rope, so perhaps the little " Emperor,"' at 
Cole's Creek, may be forgotten in the Attorney at Rich 
mond. I have been weak all day, and again put off brief 
ing until to-morrow. 11 P. M. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1807. 

I had Mr. Douglas called to me, to request him to treat 
me to a walk in the yard this morning before breakfast. 



344 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

My visitors, in the course of the day, generally complain 
of the closeness of my apartment, and some tell n.e they 
choose to reside in certain quarters of the town for the 
sake of high elevation and more air; others, that they 
prefer country quarters near town, for similar reasons, and 
wishing me soon to partake of like advantages. My 
walk for half an hour in the yard this morning, heing the 
second time I have been from under the roof of this 
building, save the day I was taken to court, 10th instant, 
was very agreeable, notwithstanding its narrow limits, 
both of time and space, and the high walls and buildings, 
in defiance of all which my lungs seemed to me to quaff 
their aerial draughts with a spring and vigor I have sel 
dom felt before. I have procured materials from the 
druggist for making some oxygenized muriatic acid gas, 
with which I will, perhaps to-morrow, destroy the noisome 
miasma that infests the air of these rooms. Continued 
my labors on my brief, of which I completed the seven 
teenth folio by dinner time, when, who will believe it ! I 

was visited in the most friendly manner by David "W e. 

It is inconceivable how he will profit by the hints he has 
had from General Tupper, or if called upon again, which 
he seems to dread, how he will travel out of his deposi 
tion before the grand jury. I received him with the 
courtesy of a prisoner, now in his own quarters. He sat 
a little, and then took leave, confused. I was not after 
ward left fifteen minutes alone, before every muscle of 
my face was relaxed from the rigor in which W. had 
bound them, to wanton in the liveliest welcome of Little 
Gates, who hurried to take my hand with an ardor and 
frankness that testified the sincere interest he felt in see- 



DILEMMA. 345 

ing me well. He had been in town since Sunday, but his 
duties of attending to the chance of his being called as a 
witness in court, and the irresistible interest excited there 
since his arrival, prevented his calling on me sooner. He 
staid better than an hour, during which his conversation 
was full of interest and entertainment, from certain com 
munications he made me, of men and things, of which 
I shall make use in my brief, as well as from two or three 
anecdotes and stories he told me of some military char 
acters, and their achievements at Marietta, on the night 
the boats were seized there, of all which he acquitted 
himself with great humor and spirit. I shall expect the 
fulfillment of his promise to visit me often, with as much 
interest as I felt this evening. Visited by a sensible, gen 
teel man, with a hard Dutch name, which I forget, hav 
ing lost his ticket. He reminded me of having seen me, 
seven years ago, in this town, and invited me to his house, 
when I recover my liberty. My last visitor was Stokely, 
who declared, had he been in Wood county at the time 
of the troubles, by which my family and property so 
much suffered, he would have exerted whatever influence 
he had to prevent them. He said he was very sorry to 
observe the counsel on both sides agreeing in one thing 
at least, that is, to keep me so constantly as they do in 
the front of the fight. He could not understand the 
policy of A. Burr's counsel, contending that their client 
is not answerable for any acts of mine, and affected to 
lament deeply his fears, that, in addition to all I had al 
ready suffered, I should end at last by falling a victim be 
tween the cunning of Burr, on the one side, and the fury 
and prejudice of the prosecutors on the other. I thanked 



346 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

him, and said, I had thoughts of summoning him as a 
witness for certain purposes that might be connected with 
my defense, hoping, if I should do so, he would excuse 
the trouble of the journey ; to which he assented, with 
expressing great desire to see me again settled in the 
" White House on the Island." But how much sooner 
should I suspect treachery in this man twelve months 
past, than in others who have since been seeking my ruin. 
Old Neale will not come to see me, partly from scruples 
as to the obligations of duty, being summoned on part of 
prosecution, and the aversion he would feel to see me in 
this place. Hay having yesterday stated he would rest 
the evidence, as to the overt acts, "Wickham has to-day 
spoken very ably for four hours, chiefly to contend, that, 
the acts not having been proved, no evidence should be 
offered of the intentions, or that if the acts have been 
proved, Burr, as an accessary at a distance from the scene 
of action, can not be proceeded against, until I, as a prin 
cipal, shall be convicted. If I have been correctly in 
formed, the ground has been judiciously taken, and will 
no doubt be ably maintained by Mr. Wickham, and the 
host that will follow him. I can not expect, at such a 
crisis, Alston will give a thought to any thing out of 
court. I should have added, w r hen speaking of Stokely, 
that I learned from him that James Wilson has lost his 
wife, and left Wood county for another residence. How 
has he left my business ? and what has he done with the 
valuable papers I intrusted to his charge ? My children, 
will your unhappy father yet have days and health suffi 
cient to gather together the little fragments of your prop 
erty, so widely scattered over the face of the earth ? If

he but live to finish that task, he will then be ready to 
take the last journey for his wages. My wife will, if I 
can not, seek the obligations of Dud. Woodbridge, sen., 
and others, from J. Wilson, before she spares a sigh to 

time. 

FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1807. 

D. Woodbridge called and sat with me this morning 
longer than he has done altogether since I have been 
here. He has got over the care of his examination, 
which worried him yesterday in court nearly two hours, 
and was, I understand, rather a disservice to the interests 
of the prosecution than otherwise. No witnesses are yet 
discharged, and all are as uncertain how long they will 
be detained as ever, unless there be grounds for an opin 
ion Mr. Botts has given to Duane, that the trial will be 
over by Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. B. must think 
Hay, who, I hear, has demanded time to examine authori 
ties cited on the other side in support of Wickham's 
motion, will not succeed in opposing it. It appears my 
name is as often made use of in court, during my absence, 
as it will be again on my own trial, when some curious, 
contrarieties of facts and testimonies may come out, if I 
ever shall be tried. D. Woodb ridge, from looking over 
that part of my brief narrating the conduct of the Hender 
sons, in betraying my confidence to Graham, etc., was led 
to acquaint me with a fact I was not a little mortified to 
learn, viz., that Botts is married to a sister of Mrs. Sandy 
Henderson. Must I, then, withhold to defend myself 
against the most serious witnesses against me, though my 
generous benefactor and enlightened patron, engaged to 
protect my life and character against the deadly assaults 



348 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

of his own relatives, with no other recompense than the 
pride of interposing the barrier of his talents between a 
distressed family and its menaced ruin, be averse to 
listen to a statement he would still less choose to advocate 
of his connections ? Had I been apprised of this difficulty 
in my first interview with Mr. B., I know not how he 
could have relieved me from it. I must see him on the 
subject before I send him a brief. Strange, that every 
embarrassment I labor under, great or small, is derived 
from the same source. Dudley tells me my wife's favor 
ite horse, Robin, was stolen, with other things, by one 

Welch, who has not since been heard of; that J s, the 

honest, returned him the $40, and that M , the zeal 
ous, kept the other $20. Falsehood ! thy name is Man 
not Woman. Willey visited me to-day, and was truly 
glad to see me again. I made him give me a detail of all 
his adventures from leaving the boats. He had traveled, 
in his story, as far as Fort St. Stephen's, on the Tombig- 
bee river, where he was arrested, after having lost one of 
his horses, and lived with the mulatto boy Harry for six 
days on damaged corn. Having missed his way, he had 

not seen Col. Burr from the time he left Judge B 's 

till he found him at Washington City. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1807. 

While at breakfast, little Luckett stepped in. He pro 
duced to me, I hope, the last bill, with my indorsement, 
drawn by Burr ; I had no note or recollection of it. It 
was drawn on the same baseless authority as the rest, for 
$2,500, and had, of course, suffered a like fate ; yet 
Luckett had not attempted any proceedings against me, 



PREPARING. 349 

though he showed me an account stating a balance 
against Burr of upward of 8,000, by which, and losses 
he has sustained, he says, he has been quite ruined. He 
intreated my best interests with Alston, and never expects 
any thing from rne. I nope soon to be able to state the 
details of a final arrangement with Burr and Alston, to 
extricate me from all these embarrassments. Having 
learned from Luckett, I was to be taken to court to-day, 
at noon, to be arraigned, I was in the act of dressing 
when two Deputy Marshals called upon me, half an hour 
earlier than was necessary, excusing themselves by say 
ing my watch was so much too slow, though it was 
exactly with the town clock. The distance from hence 
to the capitol being nearly a mile, and as I have not been 
well, I had sent my servant to town to procure me a 
horse, but as he had not yet returned, I asked these gen 
tlemen if they had brought a carriage, as had been done 
the last day I was taken to court, telling them my reasons 
for not wishing to walk. They answered, " the law did 
not make any such provisions, and the walk would serve 
me." So I soon attended them, though not in the style 
that was provided the 10th instant. My two attendants 
on foot, to-day, were unarmed, both going and returning. 
I had time enough before court opened to prepare for my 
counsel a list of thirty-nine witnesses I should have time 
allowed me to get here before I could be ready to go to 
trial. Of these, I informed Mr. Botts, twelve I deemed 
material to disprove all evidence that did, or might yet 
attempt to, prove my having committed any overt act ; 
the rest to prove I had in nothing manifested a traitorous 
design, and of the number I wanted subpcenas duces tecum, 



350 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

for five or six, to procure the production of various docu 
ments that might be necessary to my defense. My other 
witnesses are summoned on either side, in the present 
trial; so that the original list I took with me to court to 
day contains no less than fifty -five. Mr. B. then stated, 
that as a long list of witnesses I had furnished him lived 
as distant from hence as Natchez, it seemed hest to post 
pone my arraignment until the opinion of the court 
should he known on the several points made on the part 
of A. Burr, which would equally affect my case and his, 
when, if necessary, I should he prepared to state at what 
time I could expect the forthcoming of my witnesses, so 
that I might be arraigned by Wednesday. To this, Hay 
agreed ; the court, which sat to-day only on my account, 
was adjourned, and I returned to this prison as I left it, 
that is, unarraigned. I hear Bollman is with Burr con 
stantly, and no doubt busy. If it does not appear that 
Burr can boast as Chas. Fox did, amidtice, sempiternce, yet 
may he say inimicitice placabilis. Alston's prose, and Boll- 
man's talents for intrigue, are recommendations or ano 
dynes to a mind that finds no difficulty in obliterating the 
impressions of sensations heretofore received from either 
by the letter to Pinkney, which is before the public, or 
the process-verbal of the interview with Jefferson, which 
is not yet given to the world in detail. Enough has 
already appeared in these notes to warrant my suspicions 
as to Alston ; and, in addition to the hint given, to-day 
and 19th instant, of my opinion on Bollman's manoeuvre 
with Jefferson, I am the more confirmed in a disposition 
to mistrust both the motive and the matter of the inter 
view, as well as his letter to Duane, because, as yet, he 



I 
FRESH AIR. 351 

has not had the curiosity to see me ; neither a community 
of interest nor suffering has affected him. He has had no 
other motive probably to suggest to him a wish for my 
acquaintance, for he has possibly never heard from 
authority that I had been offered to choose him or Shaw 
for my private secretary, when I should name a diplomatic 
appointment for myself. This would have been a useless 
and dangerous humiliation of Mr. B.'s pride, which, no 
doubt, his master has long since found more accommo 
dating to his views than mine. My visitors, this evening, 
were General Tupper, D. Woodbridge, Belknap, Wood 
and Doctor Bennett. The last, who has been brought 
here to support P. Taylor's evidence, of my having writ 
ten to him a treasonable letter, by Taylor, is friendly, and 
can swear that I wrote nothing to him of a traitorous 
nature, though Taylor told him the letter was of that 
sort when he gave it to him. The doctor says, he sup 
posed I wanted the arms I wrote to him to endeavor to 
borrow for me, ten or twenty guns, to defend my family 
and property against illegal outrage he knew I appre 
hended at that time from the Wood county volunteers, 
in the same sense in which, in my brief, I have stated this 
part of my case to counsel. General Tupper read over a 
most humorous lampoon on most of the military charac 
ters engaged in the heroic feats of arms they performed 
on the night of the 10th of December last at Marietta, 
of which, I hope, I shall obtain a copy to relieve the 
ennui of these notes. I find it very agreeable this even 
ing to get upon a chair, by which I am enabled to raise 
my mouth to the lower tier of openings in the grating 
of the windows and breathe another air for half an hour. 



352 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPEKS. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1807. 

If Alston could not make the same excuse for not call 
ing on me yesterday that he might have offered some days 
back, still less could he do so to-day, when I suspect he 
has been sent to me. Luckett, this morning, told me it 
was Col. Burr's wish that I should write to Alston, to do 
the best he could for him, about the dishonored bill L. 
holds with my indorsement. Suspecting the correctness 
of this statement, I replied, " that Col. Burr was a ready 
penman, and in the habit of writing to me on matters of 
business ; that L., therefore, must endeavor to get him to 
specify, under his hand, how it was necessary Mr. Alston 
should learn his wishes from me while they saw each 
other every day; my own wishes for the relief of L. I 
had no objection to signify to Mr. Alston in my own way." 
Luckett posted off, and has procured by his importunities, 
not a letter from Burr, who never puts pen to paper 
but under the influence of necessity, though he is, per 
haps, the most constant writer in America, but a visit 
from Alston. When he came in, I inquired, "what 
were Col. Burr's expectations of the fate of the motions 
now before the court ? " He said, " they, or some of them, 
would prevail, and the trial would be over by Wednesday 
or Thursday ; that he and Mrs. Alston would very soon 
leave town, and that Col. Burr, on his discharge, would 
immediately occupy himself with the business of form 
ing a land company, and settling the Washita lands." 
Perceiving he had an interest in thus abruptly informing 
me of this project, I encouraged him to dwell upon it, 
when I found that, though he had been conversing with 



SUSPICION. 353 

Burr 011 the subject, he wished me to inform him whether 
Burr had ever seen the lands. I told him I was not cer 
tain, but believed not, adding, that Tyler and Smith, 
who had once been very intent on settling there, had long 
ago abandoned the scheme, believing, from information 
they had procured, and could rely upon, Lynch's title was 
bad, and they were accordingly busily preparing to settle 
in the Attakapas .country, very distant from the Washita 
lands, which were condemned by very good judges I 
named to him, who had visited them. Alston seemed 
surprised at this intelligence, and said the commissioners 
had confirmed Lynch's title. I told him I doubted that, 
but it was immaterial, as Lynch had long ago been a 
bankrupt, so that I had not much thought of accepting 
or purchasing 10,000 acres of those lands which Col. 
Burr had offered me. I should not be surprised to learn 
very soon that Burr has been promising to replenish 
Alston's coffers, which he will empty of 50,000 at least, 
from his Eldorado on the Washita. I well know B.'s 
address, in preventing or evading the simple questions he 
does not like to answer. I have seen Alston often yield 
to it, and wonder not that he shall seek from me that in 
formation of which he found Burr so tenacious. This, 
then, may turn out another instance, in addition to many 
others I have furnished, in which B. may see cause to 
deprecate my knowledge of him, and curse that candor 
of integrity that has so often traversed his purposes. 
Bollman's cautious skill, perhaps, will never betray him 
into similar indiscretions ; but Major Smith will be here 
to-morrow, and then bursts the bubble. After I had next 

given Alston some account, by his desire, of the country 
23 



354 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

about Natchez, in which I also took liberty to correct 
many errors in Col. Burr's view of that subject, I con 
trived to let him broach the business he came on. He 
asked me if I had seen Nicholas to-day. I said no ; but 
Luckett had been here with another of my indorsements, 
and an account he showed me, with a balance struck 
against Col. Burr, of something better than $8,000 ; thus, 
said I, almost every week I discover some new demand 
upon me on account of this business ; and I have now 
ascertained that, besides other losses, my name has me 
responsible for $21,000. Well ! says he, it will cost me at 
least $50,000. I mentioned the bill and balance together, 
to try if he would offer any objections to responsibilities 
I had entered into exceeding the amount of his guarantee 
to me, but finding he did not, I then told him the amount 
of the bill was only $2,500. With the account between 
Col. Burr and Luckett I had no concern, and recom 
mended the latter to such present relief as he could afford 
him. He seemed pleased ; said Nicholas would probably 
accept his terms ; should remove the incumbrances on my 
property in Philadelphia, and invited me to Carolina, and 
promised soon to see me again. Then, returning to the 
subject of the trial, he told me a piece of news, which 
well deserves a place here as so much secret history, 
characteristic of the feelings and energies of the Chief 
Justice. It seems, after the Judge had determined to 
give the prosecutors time, from Friday until Monday, to 
prepare to answer the arguments of the opposite counsel 
on four points, any one of which being supported by the 
court, the trial ends. A friend of General Marshall asked 
him if, in suspending a criminal prosecution by granting 



VATICINATION. 355 

this indulgence, he had not made a rule that had no pre 
cedent. To this he answered, "he knew it;" but if he 
should decide against the prosecutors on any of these 
points, he would be reproached with not being disposed to 
give them an opportunity to answer them ; and that he 
will probably not overrule them at all is more probable 
from an expression of his, while playing at chess with 
Wickham, since the latter made the points. " Do n't you 
think," said he, "you will be able to check-mate these 
fellows, and relieve us from being kept here three weeks 
more ? " In the evening Gates called, and soon left me, 
to give way to Wickham and Botts. This visit provided 
for a wish I yesterday expressed, in court, to Mr. B., to 
see him in the course of this day, my object being to state 
to him candidly the objections I had lately discovered to 
his appearing as an advocate for me in my defense, which 
might expose the breach of honor and confidence I com 
plained of, on the part of his connections. But as he 
brought Mr. Wickham with him, and it seemed their 
joint opinion that the decision on the points now before 
the court would probably this week put an end to Burr's 
trial, and occasion the relinquishment of mine, or, if that 
did not happen, they had determined upon a plea in 
abatement, for a misnomer to the indictment in my case, 
which they thought must prevail, and then the prose 
cutors would probably despair of success in getting 
another grand jury to find another bill against me ; or, 
if they should make such an experiment, I should most 
probably, in the mean time, be admitted to bail. From 
this view of their opinions, I said I hoped it would not be 
necessary to trouble them with my brief, and I could not 



356 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

venture the appeal to Mr. Botts's feelings, which I pro 
posed to make in this interview. My accomplished 
friends now terminated their visit with their accustomed 
kindness, and left me in a sublime reverie on their virtues 
and talents, which was soon broken in upon, by the ap 
pearance of Mr. Douglas with a stranger ; I should rather 
have said, by two apparitions, for it was now near night 
fall, and Douglas no sooner appeared than he turned on 
his heel, saying, " Colonel Duane, sir," and ran down 
stairs. The surprise of this interruption the stranger, 
whom I had never before seen, did not suffer to endure 
long enough to allow me to invoke the angels and min 
isters of grace for my protection. I was already within 
the grasp of this Gabriel of the Government. He seized 
my hand, and bade me dismiss my surprise, however 
natural it might be on his appearance before me. I 
handed him a chair, and said, " I had lived long enough 
in this country to be surprised at nothing it could produce 
or exhibit, but yet desired to learn from what cause I had 
the favor of this visit." " Having heard Mr. Douglas ob 
serve," said he, " you would be pleased to see me." " Sir, 
Mr. D. has made a mistake ; he must have meant some 
body else." " No matter," continued he ; " having seen 
and known your present situation, I could not as a man, 
and an Irishman" here he digressed, to show how he 
both was, and was not, an Irishman " I would not leave 
this town without warning you of the sacrifice now pre 
paring to appease the Government by your friends, of 
which you are destined to be the victim. You can not 
desire any other key to my meaning than the course the 
defence has this week taken ; but if you think the Gov- 



COL. DUANE. 357 

ernment will not cease to pursue that justice they possess 
the means of insuring, and suspect, as you ought, the 
designs of those you have too long thought your friends, 
it might yet appear no better, on my part, than a nominal 
service to give you these cautions. I have therefore 
sought you, not to tender you words, hut deeds ; the only 
return, on your part, will be that care of yourself which 
will find a shield in my honor " here he very awkwardly 
struck his breast, and grinned a ghastly smile " and 
that confidence I can command in the Government, whose 
good faith is not misplaced in the zeal I have testified to 
serve it." To this harangue, delivered somewhat less, 
perhaps, with the action and manner of Satan personat 
ing Duane than that of a felon, he added violent prot 
estations of his wishes to serve me, saying that for that 
purpose he would put off* his journey back to Phila 
delphia, which otherwise was irrevocably fixed for Wed 
nesday, and would now, or at any time hereafter, go to 
Washington for me, where nothing he should ask would 
be refused him. In thanking him for the frankness and 
zeal with which he cautioned me against my friends, 
and a negligence of my safety, I assured him I was not 
afraid to meet the prosecution, as I expected I should, 
before my arrival here, without counsel or friends ; but 
from present appearances I was more curious than in 
terested to learn what were those means he said Govern 
ment possessed of insuring justice? Finding by his 
answer he was now disposed to allure me into a con 
fession of having written certain papers in the hands 
of the prosecutors, I told him, " the warmth of his offers 



358 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to serve me could not make me forget either his situation 
or my own, with relation to the Government; that I 
cared not what writings should he charged upon me, 
I should admit none until fairly proved, which, if any 
such should ever appear, I would justify, if necessary, 
on the scaffold. He now summed up the objects of his 
mission, whatever produced it, with ahuse of Burr, 
Tyler and Smith, acknowledging that he had heen 
served gratis hy the first, in the most handsome man 
ner ; that the others were more concerned against the 
Government than I was ; hut swearing that he believed, 
if I did not follow his advice, they would make a scape 
goat sacrifice of me for their deliverance. Can I make 
no use, then, of this adventure ? yes, I will put this in 
terest in requisition, if I can't find readier means to 
abbreviate the imprisonment of Vaun. I have again laid 
by my brief, which I shall not probably soon resume 
until all my expectations of Burr's success and my own 
are reversed. In the mean time, I will attend to the 
adjustment of my private affairs. Ellis called in to-day, 
and seemed pleased with having it in his power to offer to 
spare some money to me, if I wanted it. I was very glad, 
I said, to find Col. Burr was in cash. " Not at all," said 
he ; "I was with the Marshal, and pretended a subpoena 
had been served on me at Natchez, and got 140 odd dol 
lars. This was all Col. Burr could yet do for me." This 
is caution, with a vengeance.. The Marshal's runners 
have these two nights past been in busy search of General 
Dayton. If he is taken this way, how will he appear 
to the multitude? 



ALSTON. 359 

i 

MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 1807. 

Between 8 or 9, A. M., arrived Major Smith in this 
place. He has got the room under me to sleep in, and 
no reasons of state or measures of public safety appear 
at present, though they were obvious three weeks ago, to 
prevent our living together until bed-time, that is, 8, P. M. 
He has not heard from Burr, though Mr. Martin has 
visited and offered him to be his counsel, gratis. I was 
visited by De Pestre, whom I was obliged to send away 
to attend to Nicholas, who will probably do something 
definite as to Sanders with Alston to-day or early to 
morrow. For, strange to say, the latter, De Pestre 
assured me, was going home to-day, but Nicholas says he 
will put it off until to-morrow. I apprehend I slaall be 
obliged to accept of that friendly invitation he gave me 
yesterday. Smith heard that Burr has made financial 
arrangements in Philadelphia to settle every thing after 
his acquittal. Midnight. 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1807. 

The unexpected arrival of Alston on the stairs before 
8 o'clock this morning, while I was walking with Major 
Smith in the passage, operated as a panic, and soon 
inspired a conviction of the apprehensions I entertained 
yesterday, after having seen De Pestre, that he would be 
off with French leave. I composed myself, however, to 
receive him with an air of confidence I have generally of 
late dissembled toward him, affecting at the same time a 
little surprise at so early a visit. This he parried, with a 
whiff of his cigar, which gave him time to think to say, 



360 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

" the court was to sit as early as nine, and he meant to 
lose nothing of all that was expected from Wirt, who 
would have the advantage of a good foil afforded him 
yesterday by the wretched exhibition of McRae, which 
soon became so flat, that it nearly cleared the Louse." 
" He affected," said he, " to prance at starting, but could 
only crawl all day over the ground ; even Hay confessing 
he did not understand the question, and Botts, who would 
next have spoken, declaring that he had heard nothing 
that required a reply from him. Alston now called me 
into my apartment to dispatch the object of his early 
visit, which seemed to be, to leave town without incurring 
any complaints of mine for not concluding, before his 
departure, the so long-expected arrangement with Nich 
olas. He therefore objected to the difficulties that he 
said Nicholas and Randolph pretended to feel in remov 
ing the attachment from my funds in Philadelphia, with 
out particular orders from Sanders. I said I should 
expect or coerce Sanders to do that, in virtue of the set 
tlements I had made with him in Lexington, whether Mr. 
Alston furthered that settlement or not. He then said 
Nicholas yesterday promised to have the necessary papers 
ready last evening, but he would have me completely 
exonerated from the demand before he did anything; to 
which I, of course, assented. But, I asked, what had 
occasioned the determination I heard he had formed of 
leaving town yesterday or to-day? "0! the certainty 
of the trials ending this week had made him desirous of 
leaving this place, of which he was heartily tired, as soon 
as possible, and his anxiety to try to raise even a part of 
the money for my relief would the more hurry him away." 



RUMORS. 361 

He forgot, I suppose, he yesterday told Nicholas he had 
just received letters that suddenly called him home. A 
propensity to rely more on his wits than his memory, is a 
prominent trait in this character. It would, then, have 
answered no purpose to have inquired into the fact of the 
letters being concerned, rather than my sufferings, with 
the period of his journey. He could easily say, " "t was 
true, he had letters;" for he is very circumspect to avoid 
changes upon his words, which I took an occasion 
again to-day to put to the test by observing to him, that 
I supposed my losses by Miller's sale of my effects, which 
had been sacrificed in Wood county, would not be much 
short of 15,000, which sum would not replace two-thirds 
of my library, my furniture, instruments, house-linen, etc., 
with all my farming-stock and implements of husbandry, 
for all which I had no other hope of indemnity but what 
I could derive from the honor and resources of Col. Burr 
and himself; to all of which he was silent. But he might, 
and did, add, nothing more engaged his concern so much 
as his wishes to relieve my embarrassments. He then 
told me Col. Burr wished me to be upon my guard 
against spies, as he apprehended some had been lately 
visiting me under the mask of friendship. On asking 
him whether he alluded to any particular persons, I found 
he had heard of Duane's visit to me on Sunday evening, 
which was next day in every body's mouth, and may pos 
sibly have had some share in engendering a report which 
as yet has been only whispered, though it may have stolen 
into some of A. Burr's private audiences. This report 
states that I now see Burr in a different light from that in 



362 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

which I first regarded him, and that my fellow-prisoner, 
Major Smith, is come on determined to denounce Burr, 
and turn an approver. Alston did not hint this rumor to 
me, but I thought it would be serviceable to the interests 
of my pecuniary expectations from him to send him 
back to Burr, satisfied of my vigilance and perseverance 
in those duties of honor and good faith which, if they 
doubted in me, I should never forget I owe to myself. 
"Ha!" said I, "you 've heard of Duane's visit to me, 
then ; would you wish to see my notes of what passed 
between us?" " Yes," said he, eagerly, " very much in 
deed." I then read to him the minutes I had taken on 
Sunday evening, with which he seemed highly pleased, 
and said they ought to be published. To this I told him 
I could not accede, though it might seem to him the more 
necessary from some observations made to me by Duane, 
more than I thought necessary to enter in my notes, of 
which I recollected one, that concerned Alston himself, 
who now seemed all anxiety for the disclosure he ex 
pected. But I affected to attach little importance to the 
thing, and said, after no small enjoyment of his solicitude 
about it, " 't was only that Government had got posses 
sion of one of his letters to me." " One of my letters!" 
said he ; "I never wrote to you but two upon business of 
a private nature, and any other letter they can have of 
mine must be a forgery." " To be sure," said I ; "or at 
all events, from the favorable course things are now likely 
to take, such a letter could do no harm." " But what did 
the rascal," continued he, " state to be the purport of the 
letter ? " " Nothing more," said I, " than proving that 



COLLOQUY. 363 

you and myself were equally involved in all Col. Burr's 
projects." He then abused Duane, repeated his wish my 
notes were published, and took leave. 

I find I have omitted to observe, owing to the hurry 
and fatigue I suffered the day I arrived in this prison, 
that Alston, on his first visit to me that evening, acknowl 
edged the receipt of the letter I had written him from 
Natchez, containing a reprobation of his public letter to 
Gov. Pinkney, when he said, " he felt now no uneasiness 
at certain reflections I had therein made use of, which he 
knew proceeded from a warmth of temper natural to me 
upon a misconception of his motives, which he had ex 
plained to the satisfaction (is it possible ?) of Col. Burr." 
To which I answered, that the letter itself would say it 
was not designed to excite any unpleasant sensations, 
though it was written under impressions that could not 
be obliterated, and that his not answering my letter, 
which was so incumbent on him, from the nature of that 
part of it relating to money matters, so irritated and con 
vinced me that he disregarded my expectations from him, 
arising from his guarantee for my losses by my concern 
with Col. Burr and himself, that I was further led' to 
declare, at Lexington, that he was as fully concerned 
with Col. B. as myself, stating at the same time to him a 
further motive for such a declaration, which will be found 
in my notes of the 6th instant. All this he accepted very 
kindly, assuring me he had written two letters to me. 
"What! two!" yes; he not only then, that is, on the 
fourth instant, said two, but said so again to-day. E"ow 
those who are blest with his correspondence, will find he 
is not in the habit of bestowing two answers on one letter, 



364 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

especially when that one has chiefly for its object to bring 
a demand upon him into action, much less to grant a sin 
gle reply to a letter which, through respect to his wife, 
he might at least acknowledge. I allude to our friend 
Harding's letter to him that he confessed he had received, 
but told me on his first visit it merely inclosed some papers 
to him, and required no answer. So the generous labors 
of the head and heart of one of the best men living did 
not deserve even the thanks of this coxcomb. But it 
appears from all this, that if his second letter was in 
answer to the only one I ever wrote him, his first was 
occupied with some other subject ; and the palpable inter 
est with which he listened to the late news Duane left 
with me for him, joined with the motives that induced 
him to write the death-warrant of his character to Pink- 
ney, and some late rumors of designs in Government, to 
institute a prosecution against him also, all leave little 
room to doubt that the prosecutors have got hold of 
something he would not like to see. But if this alarm 
will give me hold upon him, to keep him long enough 
here to carry some of his sincere wishes into execution, 
I shall owe Duane more obligations for his visit than he 
is aware of. I received a note from Prichard, covering 
the bill I had drawn on Philadelphia in his favor, which 
was returned for reasons already given in my notes of 
last Monday. Behold me, then, without a dollar, except 
the few that remain of thirty Prichard sent me a fort 
night since. On this very bill I have had my coat re 
paired, my umbrella newly covered, my hat dressed, and 
my boots new-tapped. But this economy will not pay 
my tavern bill, nor those of my grocer and washer- 



APPREHENSION. 365 

woman. Nor will it restore to me the only funds on 
which I depended for my only care, the maintenance of 
my family. My own wants will never solicit the mantle 
of charity to shelter them from the pinching blast of ad 
versity, until death shall lay the storm. Until then the 
cry, even to the heart of Mr. Alston, pray spare a trifle 
from your stock, to clothe my naked family, with that 
credit of which you Ve stripped it. In this spirit I wrote 
him what follows : " I have just received the inclosed, by 
which you may convince Mr. Nicholas of the unjust and 
absurd obstruction of my credit in Philadelphia, by the 
continuance of Mr. Sanders's attachment. Having no 
other source of pecuniary supply to which I can resort 
for subsistence of my family, until I can collect the wreck 
of their property, I await the accommodation of such 
credit or remittances as your dispositions may devise for 
the relief of my exigences. Yours, H. B." The servant 
returned with a verbal answer, in these four words "He 
will see him," importing that Alston would see Nicholas, 
as if seeing N. will indemnify me for all I have suffered, 
or support my family. Alston told me Belknap has con 
fessed he received from Smith $700 for me, which he 
denied the night he arrived on the "Island" from Ken 
tucky, the night I left it. 

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26, 1807. 

The bird, I believe, has not flown to-day, but may take 
wing, I know not what moment. I have neither seen 
nor heard from him since his verbal answer to my letter 
of yesterday. The little animal has clapped its wings in 
screaming essays toward the " Oaks ;" but yet may it re-

main a little longer on that egg it has not yet hatched, 
for the cuckoo that laid it. Wirt raised his reputation 
yesterday, as high as McRae sunk his the day before. 
The former, I learn, paid me some compliments. We 
have many visitors, as usual, of whom I shall only notice 
Kerr, who sat one hour here this evening. Was cautioned 
by Dud. Woodbridge to beware of Bennet. But I have 
him secured by Tupper, who tells me he, Tupper, will 
support the declarations made by Bennet to him and me, 
on Bennet's first visit here to me. Major Smith is suffer 
ing something of a seasoning. 

THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1807. 

Rose at a quarter past 5 this morning, to walk in the 
yard, as I had agreed with Major Smith last night; but 
he rested badly, and had a profuse perspiration when I 
called upon him, which determined him, with my advice, 
to stay in bed. So I walked for an hour alone, under a 
disagreeable fog, with a view to try whether breathing so 
long another, if not a better, air than that of my room 
might not enable me to escape to-day a periodical head 
ache, with some fever, we both complain of about 2 
o'clock every day since Sunday, and of which we are not 
free some nights, before we go to bed. Young Swartwout 
called upon us with Alston. The latter called me out to 
tell me things will be completed to-day with Nicholas, 
from whom h.e will get the original bills on which the 
attachment was served on the house of J. S. Lewis & Co., 
as my garnishees, by which, I suppose, I can again open 
the channel of my credit which the attachment has so 
long shut up in Philadelphia. He assures me Luckett's 



MR. DUNCAN. 367 

account is not admitted to be correct by Burr, and that I 
shall not be liable for the bill of $2,500 with my indorse 
ment in Luckett's hands. He has also offered me a draft 
at sight on Charleston, for the bill returned me by Prich- 
ard. He concluded his money business with me this 
morning, by telling me Col. Burr will be soon in cash, 
having concluded some financial arrangements with a 
Mr. Pollock, who is very rich. I must not forget, how 
ever, he also told me his settling both Sanders's and Mil 
ler's claims, if the latter will come into the arrangement, 
will, with the incidental charges, require payments by 
him to the amount of $16,000 ; so that after settling San 
ders's claim, if Miller won't settle in the same way, he has 
proposed to take up his present letter of guarantee and 
give me another to indemnify me for what Miller may be 
entitled to recover of me, to which I have assented. Mr. 
Alston has found Wirt, though not without merit, so far 
as he was figurative, monotonous, with bad or no action, 
and better recommended by the foil McRae afforded him 
than any interest his late essay could inspire. He seems 
to-day to partake of apprehensions entertained by Col. 
Burr's friends, that the Chief Justice may yield to want 
of energy, in ruling all the points now before him, as the 
able efforts of the counsel for the defense can not fail to 
prove the law requires. Surely, if the law has not been 
mistaken on the side of the accused, the calumny which 
has been propagated through the crowd, of Burr's emis 
saries having made an attempt to take off Mr. Duncan 
by laudanum, would tend to strengthen rather the en 
ergies of such a head and heart as the Chief Justice is 
probably blessed with. This- Duncan has been brought 



368 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

here, I am told, to prove a negative ; namely, that "Wil 
kinson is not a Spanish officer or pensioner. Duane has 
kept his promise to abandon the field yesterday. I find 
to-day he is an expert angler, and adapts his flies and 
tackling not only to the waters and seasons of his choice, 
but to that kind of fish that are the objects of his sport; 
at least, the first cast of his line has caught that wary fish, 
the natural history of which has engaged so much of 
these notes. I have been accordingly informed, a formal 
demand has been made upon Hay to declare whether tire 
Government or himself possess a certain letter, of which 
a sketch has been given here the 25th instant. The scene 
that this interview probably presented will, I know not 
how long, be reserved for recital in the secret mysteries 
of the prosecution. Alston, on his part, gave me too 
sublime a rehearsal of the dignity and force with which 
he launched the bolts of his defiance on all the Titans of 
Virginia, for me to presume to imitate it in these memo 
randa, without incurring the suspicion at least of being 
disposed to burlesque it. The Titan Hay, however, he 
assured me, he overwhelmed with mountains of con 
sternation and dismay ; in short, the fact was denied, and 
what was very extraordinary, as the like never happened 
before, imprecations of mendacity, on the fame of Col. 
Duane, were endured with patience by Jefferson's attor 
ney. The existence, however, of the letter, be it remem 
bered, is as yet no more disproved than A.'s title to 
Agrestis is established. "When Alston observed to me, 
to-day, he would give me a new guarantee against the 
amount of Miller's recovery, I said, that would be neces 
sary for two purposes ; first, for the purpose of transferring 



TUPPER'S SONG. 369 

it, as I had the former one, to Sanders, or raising money 
on it, as I had nothing else left to pledge ; secondly, for 
the benefit of my family, in the event of my death, which 
I thought very probably might soon happen. I could see 
well enough to discern a pointed attention on his part to 
the last reason. He had on a former occasion observed, 
when I assured him I should publicly expose the perfidy 
and dishonor of Graham and the Hendersons, at all 
hazards, be the issue of these trials what it might, " that 
my short sight would lay me under very unfair disadvan 
tages ; " to which I answered, " I should know how to 
accommpdate the distance to the extent of my sight ; " 
and, to-day, he hoped with earnestness that I would not 
think on any gloomy subject to cloud the prospect of 
many happy years I shall yet enjoy. This was not his 
language, but his precise meaning ; how far it was sin 
cere may be imagined from his talking in this way, after 
he returned me what another man might have kept, my 
letter given here the 25th instant, without lisping a sylla 
ble on the exposure I made to him in that letter of my 
second humiliation before his wealth, to solicit an atom 
from the heap to assuage the distress he is bound to 
relieve. Be it remembered, he has never questioned de 
mands I made upon him, independent of his first guaran 
tee for disbursements I have made for Col. Burr, to be 
tween four and five thousand dollars, in a letter of which 
he acknowledged the receipt on the 4th instant, any more 
than statements of other losses, an indemnity for which, 
when ascertained, will be sought in the honor and re 
sources of Col. Burr and himself. Tupper has promised 

me a copy of his song of the " Battle of the Boats," and

tells me the Hendersons now affect that they are obliged 
to testify against me. "When we recollect their menaces 
in Wood county to denounce me, after they had prosti 
tuted their honor to a spy, we must rather believe they 
regret to testify against that letter Sandy wrote his 
father, soliciting his consent to his son's espousing the 
principles and conduct, I confidentially recommended to 
them, which letter will show what treason I recommend 
ed or was engaged in. Robison and others tell us, this 
evening, Hay had the insolence to insinuate to-day, to 
the Chief Justice, an imp'eachment, if he did not over 
rule all the points now before the Court. Does the Chief 
Justice want energy at such a crisis to declare the law? 
surely this insult should give it to him. Prichard assures 
me Burr, on his acquittal, will not soon leave this town. 
Civil demands upon him will gather round him from all 
quarters, to a far greater amount than he can find bail 
for, if Pollock, or some other preserving angel, does not 
shield him from this new host. Then, indeed, will he 
fall more inglorious than from a gibbet. I am very 
unwell this evening, suffering under a return of the like 
oppressive weather I endured during the first fortnight 
of my imprisonment. 

SATURDAY, AUGUST 29, 1807. 

I awoke yesterday morning with a continuance of the 
indisposition under which I had labored on Thursday 
evening. I was affected with much fever and racking 
headache, to a degree of severity that compelled me to 
return to bed before breakfast, after taking three or four 
grains of calomel. Dud. Woodbridge called me aside 



APOLOGY. 371 

this morning to complain that the " Enquirer " has mis 
represented the evidence he gave last Wednesday. He 
said he had been to the printer on the subject. I could 
not understand distinctly, however, what particular fact 
had been misstated. He observed to me that he was at a 
loss to conceive the object of the counsel on both sides, 
examining him upon matters altogether irrelevant to the 
questions before the Court; such as, his opinion of my 
talents and studies, his knowledge of the amount of my 
property, and particularly the value of my place on the 
Ohio. But he supposed the drift of Col. Burr was to 
show that I could in no sense be regarded as a military 
character. He apologized for his having said that " I 
had more other sense than common sense," an expression 
which he said escaped him in the hurry and warmth of 
his examination. I accepted this explanation, but wished 
him to inform me what motive the counsel could have to 
exhibit me to the jury as a character less skilled in the 
ordinary affairs of life than common men? He now 
stated to me, that Burr's special confidants, who formerly 
sought his company here, of late, seemed rather inclined 
to avoid him, for which he was at a loss to account ; but 
that, while he boarded in the same house with Bollman, 
this gentleman had devoted much pains to learn from 
him all he could of my character, by which, having ex 
tracted from him an opinion that I was eccentric, Boll 
man, who was informed of the testimony he had given 
before the grand jury, regretted very much that D. Wood- 
bridge had not informed that body of the circumstance. 
All this is mysterious to me, and will remain so until I 
can explore the matter by opportunities I shall not fail to 



372 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

seek. I have had a large draft upon my little funds, of 
$2.55 for a large packet from Philadelphia, covering the 
following inclosures ; namely, two letters from Elliott and 
another from his wife, with the seal cut open, and several 
others of importance. Burr yesterday informed me, by 
note, he had an unsettled account with Luckett, who holds 
one of his drafts for $25, with my indorsement, which it 
would gratify him much if I could discharge : but Alston, 
two or three days ago, assured me Luckett's account was 
not allowed, and I should not be called upon to pay this 
draft. Will these adventurers never meet but in du 
plicity ? Mr. Alston has not appeared to me since Thurs 
day; he is probably engrossed to-day by Martin's con 
cluding speech, in reply upon the points now before the 
Court. Wood, this morning, gave me some information, 
which, if true, proves Burr as bad a general out of the 
field as I have no doubt he would prove in it. Speaking 
of several characters that Burr had subpoenaed from Ken 
tucky, I inquired, what benefit he expected to derive fr^>m 
John Brown, who I heard had arrived ? " He can expect 
none from him," said Wood ; " he will find Brown more 
Wilkinson's friend than his." " Brown is as truly pen 
sioned as Sebastian was by the Spanish Government ;" 
and Col. Burr must have strangely overrated his own 
powers, if he ever thought that these men would have 
joined him in any thing but words against Spain, while 
he might with the greatest ease, when he was in Ken 
tucky, have enlisted Daveiss and the whole Marshall 
party in his interest. "Daveiss and Dr. Marshall," he 
added, " would gladly have embarked in all or any of his 
speculations; they had no Spanish ties to break, and 



SEBASTIAN. 373 

Daviess instituted the first proceedings against him, partly 
from a sense of neglect on the part of Burr, and through 
enmity to the President, who he fully believed was con 
cerned with Burr, or connived at his operations. Be 
these things as they may, true or false, as "Wood is more 
or less deserving of credit it should be remembered that 
"Wood once possessed the confidence of the Marshall fac 
tion, by which he had an opportunity of knowing their 
dispositions that however unprincipled he may have 
proved in other instances, he still adheres to the denunci 
ations he published in the " Western World," which have 
already ruined Sebastian, and may yet lead to the con 
viction of other culprits, and that as he has now aban 
doned all concern with politics and newspapers, save so 
far as he can be serviceable to Burr, he can have no cal 
culable interest in depreciating the views or talents of any 
of the persons he has reflected upon. But the present 
trial can not fail to furnish ample testimony, if not to the 
guilt, at least to the defect of every talent, under the as 
sumption of which this giddy adventurer has seduced so 
many followers of riper experience and better judgment 
than myself. You were right, therefore, honest Hay, in 
observing the other day to Woodbridge, while expressing 
your concern for my situation. " that I must now think 
Burr had duped me ; " but you were wrong in supposing 

I am indebted to you for the discovery ; I am possessed 
of it these nine months. I am still without relief of my 
anxiety for my poor family. I pray the mercy of Heaven 
to prepare me for the first news I shall hear from them. 

II o'clock, P. M. 






374 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1807. 

I have heard this morning from Ellis, that General 
Jackson is hourly expected in town, and Ashley's arrival 
also looked for, this evening or to-morrow. If by either 
of these chances I shall be blessed with no disastrous 
news of my family, or even with a revival of those hopes 
that I have too long brooded upon, of once more behold 
ing the picture of my beloved wife, how great a load of 
care my hours of sorrow will throw ofi'. I trust Almighty 
God will first. ordain I shall bow with devout gratitude 
before I bound in levity or transports, to which I have 
so long been a stranger; or, if I idly dream, to wake 
perhaps to realities of sad reverse, then let me first 
invoke the Divine mercy, to retain me faithful to all my 
duties, in every task allotted to my destiny. I had a very 
interesting conversation this morning with John Banks 
and Mercer, and both eagerly charged themselves with 
the care of sending me good soup ; and as my late sick 
ness induced me at their desire to complain of the quality 
of necessaries sent from the tavern, in pursuance of 
which, soon after, Mercer left me a present of refresh 
ments of fruit and good butter, and fine calves-feet jelly, 
was sent in ice by Mrs. Gamble. The conversation, of 
course, had no other object so natural to engage our in 
terest as a comparison of the foundation of different con 
jectures respecting the decision the Chief Justice will 
deliver to-morrow on those points which have so long 
balanced this town between law and faction, and will so 
much longer poise the trembling passions of the distant 
multitude on the same pivot. Each of us was not with- 



BANKS. 375 

out an inuendo, or an anecdote, of no small interest to 
Major Smith, who, I was happy to see, continued of the 
party. My hints were thrown out only in general terms, 
alluding to the inferences I had endeavored to draw from 
the intelligence Wood yesterday gave me. Mercer, who, 
it is said, is much enamored of a very accomplished 
young lady, a relation of the Chief Justice, ably exerted 
his happy address for some time, not indeed to confirm 
the sense Banks and myself professed we so fully enter 
tained of General Marshall's high talents, deep erudition 
and amiable virtues, but to discharge our apprehensions 
of some doubts we said we lamented they had imbibed, 
that the Chief Justice would possess all the energy that 
would be necessary to reconcile the opinion he had deliv 
ered on the part of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Bollman and Swartwout, with such another as would be 
required of him to establish the most material of all the 
points now before him. Mercer insinuated he had oppor 
tunities from whence he could deduce a different antici 
pation. But neither Banks nor myself could hereby 
perceive his conjectures to be better warranted than our 
own. Banks was now led, after indulging himself with 
some general reflections on the difficulty and delicacy of 
the Chief Justice's present dilemma, in which we all 
concurred, to tell us an anecdote, with which I was sur 
prised to find Mercer unacquainted, from whence Banks 
indeed did not infer that the Chief Justice will, on the 
present occasion, shrink from his duty, as an able judge 
or a virtuous patriot, to avert the revenge of an unprinci 
pled government, or avoid other trials menaced, and 
preparing for himself by its wretched partisans, but he 



376 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

lamented, and certainly our choicest sympathies harmo 
nized witL his feelings, that the facts he had mentioned, 
of which he vouched the verity, referring Mercer to the 
office and file of the Argus, had already proved that the 
Chief Justice had explained or accommodated his en 
ergies on the bench in conformity to the views of his 
enemies, by ordering or permitting in his private character 
something to be inserted in the Argus, in the form of an 
apology to, or exculpation of, Wilkinson, purporting to 
contravene, but altogether inconsistent with, the tenor or 
expressions of declarations of opinions he, as a judge, 
had delived on the bench. This will, no doubt, engage 
Mercer's interest and anxiety so much that I will, to-day, 
add not a word to what I have already said, on a discov 
ery that has not a little depressed me. Yet I am certain, 
whatever dust or insects may have sought the Judge's 
robes while off his back, none will venture to appear 
upon the ermine that bedecks his person. Mercer and 
Banks gave me not less than two hours of their company, 
which, whether considered with regard to the elegance 
and interest of Mercer's conversation, or the friendly 
concern testified by Banks for the issue of the trial, con 
stituted one of the most agreeable visits I have received 
since my imprisonment. Mercer promised to bring me the 
earliest tidings of the decision to-morrow. Alston is too 
much occupied to call upon me, when such an effort is 
not indispensable. 

The influenza has arrived here, and found its way into 
half the families of the town. I am severely affected 
with it ; this is the third illness I have had here, which 
has compelled me to resort to medicine. As we were 



LUTHER MARTIN. 377 

chatting over some of Mrs. Gamble's fruit after dinner, 
in came the whole rear-guard of Burr's forensic army I 
mean the celebrated Luther Martin, who yesterday con 
cluded his fourteen hours' speech. His visit was to Major 
Smith ; but he took me by the hand, saying, there was 
no need of an introduction. I was too much interested 
by the little I had seen, and the great things I had heard, 
of this man's powers and passions not to improve the 
present opportunity to survey him in every light the 
length of his visit would permit. I accordingly recom 
mended our brandy as considered superior, placing a pint 
tumbler before him. !N"o ceremonies retarded the liba 
tion ; no inquiries solicited him on any subject, until 
apprehensions of his withdrawing suggested some topic 
to quiet him on his seat. Were I now to mention only 
the subjects of law, politics, news, etc., on which he de 
scanted, I should not be believed when I had said his 
visit did not exceed thirty-five minutes. I imagine a man 
capable, in that space of time, to deliver some account of 
an entire week's proceedings in the trial, with extracts 
from memory of several speeches on both sides, including 
long ones from his own, to recite half columns, verbatim, 
of a series of papers of which he said he is the author, 
under the signature of " Investigator," to caricature Jef 
ferson, give the history of his acquaintance with Burr, 
expatiate on his virtues and sufferings, maintain his credit, 
embellish his fame, and intersperse the whole with sen 
tentious reprobations and praises of other characters. 
Some estimate, with these preparations, may be formed 
of this man's powers, which are yet shackled by great 
embarrassment of delivery. In this his manner is rude, 



373 THE BLENNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

and his language ungrammaiical, which is cruelly aggra 
vated upon his hearers by the verbosity and repetitions 
of his style. With the warmest passions that hurry him 
like a torrent over those characters or topics of his con 
versation that lie most in the way of their course, he has 
by practice acquired the faculty of curbing his feelings, 
while he never suffers to charge the enemy until broken 
by the superior numbers of his arguments and authorities, 
by which he always outflanks him ; then he lets loose the 
reserve upon the center with redoubled impetuosity. Yet 
fancy has been as much denied to his mind as grace to 
his person or habits. These are gross, and incapable of 
restraint, even on the most solemn public occasions. 
Hence his invectives are rather coarse than pointed ; 
his eulogiums more fulsome than pathetic. In short, my 
amiable young friend Mercer, in his accustomed classical 
neatness, gives me every trait of his portrait, when in one 
word he calls him the " Thersites of the law." Yet, 
though Mr. M. did not intend to sit here to so bad an 
artist, he has literally promised me his portrait by a bet 
ter hand ? and I believe he is not without mShy moral 
good qualities, not very inconsistent with the sketch I 
have attempted of his character. I have no doubt he is 
unrivaled for zeal in the service of his friends, while he 
retains them from the concern with which he spoke of 
Burr's financial difficulties, declaring his friend could find 
security in Baltimore for $100,000, which I doubt, though 
I do not at all question Martin, as he said so, would be 
his bail for $10,000. I regret to find Smith neglected, not 
only by Burr, but Burr's satellites. I asked Martin if the 
prosecutors won't succeed, as I predicted by letter to B., 



INDISPOSITION. 379 

before I got here to put him upon a defense on the trea 
son bill, that will nearly amount to a confession of the 
misdemeanor? I think this has actually happened. Mar 
tin thought that because Burr alleges he expected war 
between Spain and the United States, his expedition was 
lawful. But may not a jury think Burr did not expect 
the war, and find their verdict then on the confession ? 

MONDAY, AUGUST 31, 1807. 

I suffered total privation of sleep last night, by the un 
remitting severity of my cough. This is the most 
oppressive day I have yet endured in this place, and my 
lassitude was so great, that after seeing Strickland, who, 
I am glad to hear, sets out for Natchez about Saturday, I 
read for two hours, but was obliged to go to bed, where 
I slept until awaked by Mercer, with a report of the 
Chief Justice's opinion, stating, in substance, that all the 
points of so much expectation had been established in 
favor of the accused, and my indictment virtually got rid 
of, by the Judge's opinion, that the evidence adduced to 
prove the overt acts did not prove such an assemblage as 
the law required to constitute a traitorous one. Mercer 
took much pains to state every detail his memory could 
suggest ; but I was little revived with the news. I have 
yet too many other trials to pass. The Court adjourned 
to six o'clock this evening, when the prosecutors are to 
be prepared to state the course they will now pursue. 
The result I shall learn to-morrow morning, and be 
thereby probably enabled to look to the period of my 
imprisonment, When I shall have access to Burr and 
Alston, it will be my fault if I do not see them when I 



380 THE BLEXXERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ought. My chest is very sore; I will take some medicine, 
and endeavor to sleep, after first offering up my cares and 
prayers to Heaven for my wife and boys. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1807. 

This morning I find my influenza much abated by the 
good effects of the medicine I took last night. Visited, 
as usual, by a variety of persons, before and after the ad 
journment of the Court, by whom we learn, Hay observed, 
with an affectation of terseness, that he had examined 
the opinion of the Court, and had no further arguments 
or evidence to offer, by which I should understand he 
meant to envelop in uncertainty the course the prose 
cutors will now pursue, of which no conjecture can be 
formed before to-morrow. A diversity of opinions, how 
ever, seems already to dissect the speculations of the 
prosecutors ; some supposing all the indictments will be 
abandoned by nolle-prosequis ; others, that Burr will be 
proceeded against immediately on the misdemeanor ; and 
some more, that a motion will be made to have him sent 
to the District of Kentucky, where things may work 
more favorably to convict him of overt acts, suggested to 
have been committed by him at the mouth of Cumber 
land river ; while, on the other hand, it is said, Burr will 
to-morrow move for nothing less than to be discharged 
from the indictment for the misdemeanor. But this 
seems to me too bold a dash on the part of the accused. 
I should rather presume, on the contrary, that the Judge 
would allow the prosecutors all the latitude of discretion 
they may desire in adducing evidence to prove that de 
gree or probability of guilt that may induce the Court to 



ARGUMENTATION. 381 

transmit the accused to another district, from which they 
had precluded themselves by the form in which they had 
framed the indictment for treason. Yet I can not "believe 
the Chief Justice will ever say, a man once put in jeop 
ardy of life in one district for treason, charged to have 
"been therein committed and acquitted thereof, may after 
ward be put to answer charges of other overt acts of the 
same treason in another district. Though a man may be 
responsible to the law, in twelve districts severally, for a 
distinct treason committed in each, provided the animus 
or design quo (with which) he sought his object by the overt 
acts in each be proven to have operated the overt acts, as 
their immediate preceding motive, within the district 
where they are laid in the indictment to have been com 
mitted. Thus, a man may successively meditate, and 
mentally organize or arrange, eleven separate treasons, iu 
as many States, the execution of all which he may aban 
don ; but finally, in a twelfth, he may attempt to reduce 
his project into action. But evidence of overt acts in the 
last State can not borrow evidence of the design from any 
of the former to complete his crime. The jury, I hope, 
have to-day evinced more of caprice than party spirit, by 
affecting to bring in something like a special verdict of 
acquittal. It will, however, be entered generally on the 
record. Burr has written to me to solicit Alston to as 
sume the amount of the bill Luckett holds, and felicitates 
me on the events of yesterday. I have gratified Luckett 
with a letter to that effect to Alston, whom I have not 
seen since Thursday. 



382 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1807. 

My cough still causing me some loss of rest, I had not 
risen this morning before seven, when I was visited by 
Wickham and Botts. They staid about fifteen minutes, 
and called to acquaint me they meant to-morrow to offer 
the special plea to my indictment, on which account they 
had come to invite me to visit the folks at the capitol. 
They told me Burr was not solicitous about his discharge, 
which they thought would not take place for three or 
four days. They apprehended an attempt would be made 
to have us all transmitted to the Kentucky or other dis 
tricts, which they did not appear to think would prevail. 
After breakfast, being very languid, we did nothing but 
read until a little after noon, when a Deputy Marshal un 
expectedly roused us into action, by a summons to attend 
the Court. We dressed in five minutes, and accompanied 
the officer in a distressing warm walk. We did not re 
turn till the Court adjourned, about half-past four. On 
our arrival, the Court seemed disengaged, as if it had 
been waiting for us. During this pause I could only col 
lect from Botts, that some motion was before the Court, 
which he had not time to explain, before Hay rose to ob 
serve, that as Major Smith and myself were present, and 
as we were similarly circumstanced with A. Burr, the 
same course should be pursued with us all. This called 
up Botts, who was followed by Wickham, both in very 
able arguments, contending that our cases were totally 
separate and distinct from Burr's ; the latter not being 
now, on account of his acquittal of the treason, legally 
present before the Court ; the only proper means to bring 



him there, to answer to the indictment for the misde 
meanor, being, by summons or venire facias, according to 
the laws and practice of Virginia, where process of capias 
is not allowed for any offense less than capital. Burr 
said he was ready to enter an appearance to the indict 
ment for the misdemeanor, insisting, until he did so, he 
was not legally in court on that charge; from whence I 
inferred, that the motion made before my arrival was 
probably for his discharge under the proclamation that 
should have ensued, on recording the verdict yesterday 
of his acquittal. Wickham and Botts supported their 
arguments with not only English and Federal authorities, 
but with the doctrines of Hay himself, delivered by him 
in his evidence on Chase's trial, which they dressed up in 
such comments and strictures as exhibited Hay the most 
bewildered spectacle of confusion and mortification I 
ever saw exposed to a public assembly. The Chief Justice 
said he should proceed to assign counsel to Major Smith 
for which purpose the latter got me to write a letter 
for him yesterday if the counsel of the United States 
meant to proceed against him on his treason bill, to which 
Hay answered, " it would be unnecessary, he believed." 
The Judge then observed, that the arguments would 
require his postponing his opinion until to-morrow morn 
ing. After the Court was adjourned, Burr and ourselves 
were detained about ten minutes by the absence of the 
Marshal and his deputies, who had stepped aside some 
where out of my sight, I believe, upon some consultation 
respecting the expense of Burr's guard until to-morrow ; 
for I soon heard Burr tell Botts he would pay the ex 
pense himself. The guard over him, at his present 



384 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

quarters, has hitherto cost the United States seven dollars 
a day, which, it is now understood, he must pay himself 
until discharged, since his life has been redeemed from 
the mortgage the Government had on it. Burr, during 
this detention, said he hoped he should be able to come 
to see us to-morrow or next day ; but I fancy we shall 
have the liberty of the town as soon as his highness ; and 
so after all, it is one hundred to one, I shall never be ever 
arraigned for treason. On entering the dome of the 
capitol I was indemnified for the severity of my walk, 
not merely by the pleasure of the transition from the 
heat abroad to the shade and lower temperature of that 
part of the building, but by the enjoyment of beholding 
a face I had not yet seen in town. I passed close by 
Phelps, whose visage exhibited so high-colored a picture 
of the disappointment of his malice, that I involuntarily 
smiled upon him with such satisfaction as almost tempted 
me to wish him joy. My hurry, however, did not permit 
me to speak. I must reserve my words for something 
more human. Tupper expects letters this evening. I 
have charged Billy to see him, and be with me as early 
as he can. If I but wake to good tidings from Natchez, 
how shall I sacrifice to the God of fathers, for his pre 
servation of my Harman, whom I have again dreamed I 
have lost. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1807. 

I opened my eyes first this morning in quest only of 
that object, in exclusion of all others, that occupied my 
heart last night. But instead of letters through General 
Tupper, Billy brought me early a note from him, to an- 



INCERTITUDE. 385 

nounce that there were three letters from my wife, not 
here, arrived for me, but at Marietta. To Almighty God 
be first offered my grateful and humble thanksgiving. I 
am hereby enabled to conjecture, with much probability, 
my beloved wife, at least, was well about the middle of 
July. But I dare not so far presume upon the favor of 
Providence as to conclude my boys, particularly Harman, 
were in health at that period, much less, how long they 
and their mother have since continued well. This note 
has given me, however, a vivacity to-day, in spite of the 
oppressiveness of the weather, I have not before experi 
enced in this prison, where, it is true, my friends have 
sometimes made me bear a part in the humor or interest 
of the story ; but I have ever felt on such occasions in the 
state Nicholas described, when he gives us the account 
of that part of his life during which he was conscious 
of being under the influence of two minds at the same 
instant. Or, at least, my heart would pity the momentary 
fluttering of my spirits, which, on such occasions, could 
never soar above its trouble. That truly worthy Irish 
man, Mr. Hendren, has come again to town, apparently 
on purpose to see me. (See notes of 8th ult.) If I shall 
be detained here, as is probable, for some time, after I 
shall be bailed or discharged, I have engaged to visit him 
at Shirley, twenty miles from here. Not having seen any 
one since the rising of the court this evening, we are 
without any knowledge of the proceedings there to-day. 
Luckett called, this morning, to tell me Alston required 
me to write to him again, to desire he would settle or 
assume the amount of the bill Luckett holds, with my 

indorsement, saying my last letter to him on Monday to 
25 



386 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

do so, did not express my desire with sufficient certainty. 
This is admirable ! Major Smith has seen that letter, and 
only wanted to hear this statement by Luckett, which, if 
true, settles Mr. Alston's intentions and mine. The first 
to put off, the last to hasten ; if he leaves this town, with 
out his having reasons I shall approve of for not making 
the settlements he has undertaken, my purpose is fixed to 
follow him to the " Oaks " with a friend, very soon after 
my discharge, when it shall not exceed forty-eight hours 
to conclude all my business with him. I have written to 
William Thompson a long letter, accepting his tender of 
a correspondence, and returning him my sincere disposi 
tion to improve our acquaintance into a friendship. Re 
curring with Mr. Smith to some incidents that happened 
soon after our arrival at Natchez, and speaking of Cowles 
Meade, I was much surprised to learn what I had never 
heard before, that Meade had seriously taken up an idea 
of Col. Burr's being then deranged, alleging that he 
could not be mistaken, as he, Meade, had very long 
known him. Be this as it may, Burr, yesterday, looked 
fifty per cent, better than I have ever seen him, and dis 
played a command of tone and firmness of manner he 
did not appear to me to possess before the verdict of 
Tuesday. 11, P. M. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1807. 

Visited this morning by Ellis and Doctor Monholland, 
who inform us yesterday was spent in Court in a desultory 
disputation on Hay's attempt, moved or suggested to 
have Burr transmitted to the Kentucky District; on 
which- the Chief Justice has yet made no rule, as they 



MISDEMEANOR. 387 

understand he conceives the indictment for the misde 
meanor must be first got rid of here. They also tell us 
Burr went out about 1 o'clock to procure bail, which 
they supposed he did not effect, as his guard were in 
statu quo this morning. I have written a thankful letter 
to two : I have received one from Jas. O. Hennessy, a 
Kerry schoolmaster, who appears to be settled as a private 
tutor in the family of Hudson Martin, Esq., near York 
Post-office, Albemarle county, and is very solicitous to 
serve me. Read the best part of this morning, as is 
generally my practice when not otherwise employed, and 
which will show I have not been idle, wherever it might 
appear by this diary the minutes of any particular day 
are few or uninteresting. Hay has made a special return 
instanter, to a subpcena, duces-tecum, ordering him to pro 
duce a letter from Jefferson to Wilkinson, which Hay 
did not wish made public, as parts of it were confidential. 
But his return was not accepted, and he has been co 
erced to produce the letter. The whole day has been 
spent in altercation on this subject, and the question 
whether evidence should be gone into to determine upon 
the transmissal of us all to another district, before our 
indictments for the misdemeanor are ,here disposed of. 
In Burr's case, the Chief Justice has determined his dis 
charge from his treason bill, and ordered his trial for 
the misdemeanor to proceed directly. 11, P. M. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1807. 

Burr is to-day to give bail to the misdemeanor, the 
Chief Justice having yesterday determined a capias is the 
proper process, and not a summons, on grounds I ana 



388 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ignorant of. The sum was settled at $5,000, Burr having 
prayed it might he reduced below what it had heen for 
merly fixed at since his acquittal ; and his heing in cus 
tody on civil process, altered his situation, and now made 
it more difficult for him to find hail than before. Strange ! 
I should never before have heard of this arrest on civil pro 
cess having been made upon him, and still being unre- 
moved. I observed to Alston, who has just left me, that 
I found by to-day's papers, Col. Burr and the Judge had 
both referred to this circumstance as influential in settling 
the quantum of the bail. He did not like it, and asked, 
peevishly, ""What is it the papers will not talk about?" 
This man, with his most active associates, Bollman and 
Sam. Swartwout, to whom probably young Dayton may 
now be added, has, I believe, been more active with every 
thing than his purse to serve the interests of Burr ; his 
industry enabled him, rather than his judgment or 
knowledge of the subject, to anticipate the opinion of the 
Chief Justice on the late arguments of an entire week, 
long before any body else scarcely would venture an opin 
ion, or conjecture about it. And if the Coryphcd of the 
prosecution were solicitous to collect, from every opportu 
nity they could derive from the Judge's conduct, materials 
to fabricate an impeachment against him, the Triumviri 
above mentioned were not less busy in their preparations, 
by rumors or publications, to arraign him for timidity be 
fore the tribunal of public opinion, in case his judgments 
had been adverse to their wishes. Notwithstanding the 
dignity and independence of the Judge's mind, I suspect 
from some hints dropped to me by Mercer, Mr. Marshall 
early perceived his course lay between Scylla and Charyb- 



DOUBTS. 389 

dis, though he equally disregarded the dangers that men 
aced him on either side. Again, Alston has detected, by 
his spies, some curious governmental manoeuvres, that 
have been going on in Kentucky, nothing less than prep 
arations by Bibb, the District Attorney there, for our 
prosecution in that State to be instituted, if not already 
commenced, the moment we are discharged here, provided 
only the necessary witnesses can be trained and suborned, 
and a grand jury packed for the purpose. Alston assures 
me the grand jury was actually to have been embodied 
yesterday, if the scheme had succeeded, of which he ex 
pected to be advised by Monday. Hence we learn to ac 
count for Hay's delays, to dismiss the other treason bills 
here, which he may yet possibly proceed upon, though 
he has declared he would enter nolle prosequis if he finds 
his speculations in Kentucky likely to miscarry. Why 
else has Major Smith been served to-day with copies of 
his indictments ? Alston tells me, Duncan was yesterday 
evening examined upon interrogatories by consent, by 
Burr and Botts, preparatory to his, Duncan, leaving town 
to-day. The object was to obtain matter to discredit 
Wilkinson. It is pretended Duncan has proved Wilkin 
son guilty of forgery, in erasing and altering the cipher 
letter. But I do not place implicit reliance on the full 
extent of this statement. Burr's guard, it is added, will 
be dismissed to-day. But the business of bailing may 
undergo some procrastination, I suppose, if any part of it 
depends upon expectations from Alston, who has not 
to-day said a word to me upon money matters, from 
which I do by no means imagine he has yet concluded 
any thing with Nicholas or Luckett. I was not sorry he 



390 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

did not call me out. I shall not forget to construe his 
silence upon my last note to him, to settle with Luckett 
for the bill as an acceptance of one demand, at least, 
beyond the limits of his letter of guarantee. Though had 
he spoken to me in private, I was prepared to express to 
him my surprise at the freedom he used in speaking of 
what passed during my visit from Duane, after I had 
apprised him I did not wish it published ; also, to warn 
him of my being acquainted with the officious inquiries 
his friend Bollman had been making about me, and to ac 
quaint him, that though his agent in Philadelphia would 
probably exonerate me from one of the attachments, yet 
he had not paid the bill, in the manner stated to me on a 
former occasion. (See notes of 27th and 29th ult.) 

Since writing the above, before dinner, I find this even 
ing I have been much mistaken in my conjectures of the 
morning respecting the hero of these notes. Luckett has 
just stepped off with Alston's letter of guarantee to me, 
on which I have seen a special receipt from Nicholas to 
him, for a bond and mortgage. Luckett brought it to me 
to request I would also endorse on it an order to settle his 
demand for the bill, which I did very readily. The news 
by this arrival is, that Burr, besides his bail already men 
tioned, procured security to-day, also, for $30,000, in civil 
suits, which have been here commenced against him ; that 
he enjoyed a long walk this evening with Mrs. Alston, 
in which he exhibited himself through the greater part of 
the town, and will probably honor me with a visit to-mor 
row. It is again threatened that Alston will be off to 
morrow, but not without seeing me ; I fancy he will, in 
case he comes pour prendre congS, take away with him, 



SPECULATION. 391 

from my valediction, more matter of reflection for him to 
ponder on, at the Oaks, than has yet troubled him on my 
account. Half past 10, P. M. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1807. 

As I learned yesterday, which I 've omitted to mention, 
that Burr's trial for the misdemeanor had been ordered 
by the Court to commence to-morrow, the uncertainty of 
its duration has caused me no small uneasiness, lest it 
might prolong my imprisonment until the period of its 
termination. This apprehension has led me this morn 
ing to suggest, by note to my counsel, the expedient of 
my pleading in abatement to both my indictments, to 
morrow morning on the opening of the court, at once 
before the trial begins. I have had a short line in answer 
from Botts, saying, he will this evening confer with Ran 
dolph and Wickham, and endeavor to have me brought 
into court, pursuant to my desire. My speculation, on 
the success of this manoeuvre, opens to me a prospect of 
no small interest and amusement, as it may affect the 
recovery of my liberty, at least for a time, and promises 
to occasion no little embarrassment to the prosecutors, 
who can not, I believe, support a demurrer to the plea, 
which when established will, of course, destroy both of 
the present indictments against me, and thereby reduce 
Hay to the dilemma of seeing me fully discharged by the 
Court, or oblige him to apply for a recommitment, in 
order to have me transmitted to another district. But to 
open and examine the evidence from which alone he 
could exhibit even the semblance of probable' cause to 
induce the Court to grant such a motion, would occasion 



392 THE BLENNERHASSET? PAPERS. 

such an interference and obstruction of Burrs trial now 
pending, that he must be inevitably distanced, unless he 
can prevent my pleading until the present trial is at an 
end, which I also expect he will fail in, because I conceive 
it a matter of right that I should plead when I am ready 
to do so. Besides, the Court will have sufficient leisure ; 
for I understand from Mercer and Kerr, that Burr's trial 
will not, in fact, commence before Tuesday, or perhaps 
Wednesday. These gentlemen, in giving me this intelli 
gence this morning, acquaint me with some curious cir 
cumstances, which have occasioned the expected suspen 
sion. It seems, after Hay's special return to the subpoena 
duces-tecum on Friday, stating that he deemed certain 
parts of Wilkinson's letter, of 12th of November, to Jef 
ferson, confidential, which he therefore could not part 
with, etc., was held insufficient, after an animated discus 
sion by the Court, which threatened to enforce Mr. Hay's 
compliance with its orders. He then begged time to learn 
Wilkinson's pleasure, as to his producing the letter. 
Yesterday, however, he took new ground, and prayed to 
amend his return, which now set forth, " that on a fur 
ther perusal and examination of the said letter, he dis 
covered it contained some secrets of state, whereupon he 
prayed time to obtain Jefferson's consent or dissent to his 
producing it." Four days, I am told, is the extent of the 
time allowed for his receiving an answer from Monticello. 
But it is a little curious, that in order to learn his master's 
pleasure he should send the letter to him, which I am 
assured he has actually done, so that we may, by possi 
bility, be gratified with the scene that may ensue 011 Jef 
ferson's heroism, opposing his shield to the onset of the 



ANECDOTE. 393 

Chief Justice upon his attorney. But the bewildered 
Hay has, in the mean time, " let the cat out of the bag ;" 
for the great secret of state is now all over the town. It 
happened thus. While the guardian of state secrecy and 
private confidence was yesterday descanting before the 
Court on the sacred obligations of these duties, the deities 
or demons of theft and discord, combining with the evil 
genii of Jefferson and Hay, directed the keen scent and 
piercing eye of a vulture to that prey most natural to his 
appetite. John Graham, whose name may find a place 
perhaps in the history of the present administration, from 
his exploits as a spy and informer in their service, politely 
stepped up to the table where the letter lay, and while 
Hay was earnestly defending the inviolable secrecy of its 
contents, this " Bird of Paradise " was pecking at the for 
bidden fruit. The example was followed by other fowl, 
I know not how far, of the same feather. But some 
magpies, I find, were so delighted with the fruit, of which 
they had eaten in the same manner, that they flew through 
the streets in the evening, intoxicated with its flavor, and 
chattering the words, "Militia traitors!" These fine 
birds could not speak in detail of all the sweets on which 
they had regaled themselves ; yet can they rival that cel 
ebrated parrot that detected a Prince of Orange incog., 
and squall, when a little man passes by them, "Great 
General." The oracles of intrigue, however, at the capi- 
tol, have been resorted to on this occasion, who have 
answered, " that a great General expressed his opinion, 
as a secret of state, that the Mississippi and Orleans mil 
itias should not be trusted." I am a little pleased with 
this anecdote, and have some thoughts of giving it to the 



394 THE BLENNEBHASSETT PAPERS. 

public. I find Tupper and many other witnesses aro 
about to return home, some being discharged as they 
arrived ; i. e., unexamined, some having, by consent of 
parties, left their affidavits. I am inclined to infer, from 
these appearances, that poor Hay rather feels craw-sick, 
than that he is not yet fully gorged with the banquet of 
professional fame, at which he has made so long a sitting. 
As for McRae, he is utterly chop-fallen ; an object of dis 
gust to his friends, and pity to his enemies. Luther Mar 
tin sat some time with us this morning. He said he 
came to see his client Major Smith ; but his vanity as an 
author and a father led him to bring me his strictures on 
the barbarous and sanguinary toasts that were drank on 
the Fourth of July, against Burr and himself, at Elktown, 
in Maryland, and also to read two letters from two of his 
daughters. His retort on the toasters is a good philippic 
on their bloody ignorance of the law, but a mass of verbi 
age, engrossing more than one page of a paper, the points 
and arguments of which might all be neatly expressed in 
half a column. He improves in interest, as I get a nearer 
view of his sensibilities, through which he shines far 
brighter as a father or a friend than he will ever appear 
through his oratory or his writings as an advocate or an 
author. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1807. 

This day, at 11 o'clock, A. M., ended my captivity, 
which has lasted fifty-three days. I was taken down to 
Court about ten o'clock, when Mr. Botts called upon Hay 
to know what he meant to do with my treason-bill, which 
Hay agreed to have discharged, but required my deten 
tion in custody on the indictment for the misdemeanor, 



OUT OF PRISON. 395 

which produced a conversation on the subject of bail, 
during which D. Woodbridge offered me his services. 
After an examination on the amount of his property, he 
was accepted as my security in $5,000, myself being bound 
in the same sum, on condition that I attend the court on 
Wednesday, and not depart the same from day to day, 
without license, until discharged. John , Banks had also 
come up to court to assist me in the way of bail. He 
afterward accompanied me in quest of a lodging, which 
I have found at a Mr. Walton's, who seems a good sort 
of man, and will, upon my solicitation, if necessary, come 
forward to-morrow to bail Major Smith, though L. Mar 
tin will take that friendship on himself. We then re 
paired to the Post-office, where I was made happy by a 
letter from my beloved wife, of the 3d ult., whom the 
favor of Almighty God permitted the blessing of her 
health, and that of our boys. I then visited Aaron Burr, 
now settled in the house occupied lately by Alston, who 
has at last gone off this morning in the way he has so 
long threatened, that is, without taking leave. In the 
evening, I returned to the Penitentiary to visit Major 
Smith, and, after acquainting him with my having pro 
vided more agreeable quarters for him, I came away with 
L. Martin, and took up my abode at my lodgings, under 
a severe headache, the forerunner of another day's sick 
ness, which I shall probably undergo to-morrow. But it 
is just the happiness conferred by a letter from Natchez 
should be tempered with an alloy. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1807. 
As I apprehended on Monday night, I spent yesterday 



396 THE BLENNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

in bed, under much fever and sickness. In the morning, 
I fortunately begged Mr. Walton to take my cloak, as he 
was an invalid, and it was very rainy, and step up to 
court, in case of his assistance being wanted to bail Major 
Smith. Mr. W. had on Monday agreed, after much 
solicitation on my part, to come forward as the Major's 
bail, if necessary. But as I had some slight fears of 
Martin's forgetting engagements he had made while in 
his cups, thought it most prudent to have Walton on the 
spot, and the event justified my prudence; for though 
Martin had not forgotten his promise, he was incapable 
of executing it, through the effects of yesterday morn 
ing's potations. I was informed by Major Smith, that 
had not Mr. Walton arrived when he did, the Court 
would very soon have remanded him for want of bail, 
Martin having in vain endeavored to express his purpose, 
in which Burr interrupted him, not liking the statement 
he was trying to make to the Court, though Martin 
would gladly have entered bail to any amount, for he is, 
I am now convinced, one of the best-hearted men alive. 
I slept badly last night, and am very weak to-day, though 
I have attended my place in court, where the trial of 
Burr proceeded on the misdemeanor, Hay having pre 
sented from Jefferson a mutilated copy of Wilkinson's 
letter, out of which Jefferson has reserved all the parts 
alleged to be confidential, in disregard of the opinion of 
the Court rejecting the special return to the subpO3na 
aleady offered to that effect by Hay. How far the Court 
will accept from Jefferson, what it has refused from Hay, 
will not appear until the fate of six points, made by Botts 
to-day, to arrest all further evidence in this case similar 



CONSULTATION. 397 

to what was done in the treason case, shall be determined. 
The arguments on this motion will not probably be 
closed before the end of the week. I had, this evening, 
a pretty long tete a tte with Burr, during which General 
Dayton was sequestered in another room. This old sly 
boots, or Burr, who is often closeted with him, did not 
mention a hint of my seeing him, though Burr had the 
candor to tell me, when I was taking leave, he would 
return to General Dayton in the next room ; so that 
both were equally conscious I should despise the intro 
duction. Our conversation turned altogether on the 
subject of my involvment in pecuniary claims upon him, 
in which I represented distinctly, and with firmness, that 
I should expect indemnity from him for every loss I 
might incur by his paper or my disbursements for him, 
specifying to him, at the same time, many instances in 
which my property on the Ohio had already been sacri 
ficed on those accounts, and adding, that I particularly 
held Alston answerable to me for any bills, with the 
charges upon them, which I might have indorsed beyond 
the amount of Alston's guarantee to me by letter, unless 
Burr would settle such claims. He assured me he would 
adjust all such demands, whenever he can be freed from 
the present prosecutions, and can have reasonable time to 
collect his resources ; until when, he expressed a desire 
that I should employ Jacob Burnet, now here, to procure 
as much procrastination of execution on Miller's attach 
ment as he can, Alston having got Nicholas and Luckett 
to accept of his paper for their demands to the amount 
of $12,500, with charges. I will have one more consulta 
tion with Burr before I make my first demand upon 



398 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Alston for the balance of his guarantee by letter, which 
will be $2,500, at least. When that is disposed of, I shall 
meditate upon other demands, on his verbal guarantee to 
me. 10 o'clock, P. M. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1807. 

I have, this morning, conferred with J. Burnet, who 
tells me Miller may be delayed in effecting sales against 
me in Ohio for twelve months to come. I have also en 
gaged him to act as my attorney in Ohio Federal Court, 
against old Woodbridge. The Court heard Bolts and 
Martin argue further on Botts's motion, and adjourned 
early, on account of the absence and indisposition of 
some of the other counsel. I then enjoyed a further 
repast, prepared for me by my beloved wife, which had 
been withheld, I know not how long, from me. It was 
the letters she had addressed to me at Marietta, with 
others inclosed in them, to the amount of nine dollars 
postage. These being without dates, I knew they must 
be old. The profiles they inclosed of my dear boys were 
morsels of such exquisite and uncloying flavor, that they 
have developed within me sensations of delight I did not 
know I possessed. How many parts of all the lines and 
curves of these dear heads I shall scan and reflect upon, 
in many a precious reverie, it is given to few besides 
myself to care or comprehend. But did I truly know 
my patience had obtained for me any particular bless 
ing, among the many I derive alone from a beneficent 
Providence, then how much better should I know the 
pre-eminent value of that blessing, and study the holy 
tenure by which I could preserve it. I will never dare to 



IN DEBT. 399 

ask, but will receive from Divine dispensation, in this 
sense, its permission of the health and comfort of my 
little family, which I yet know not, but beseech Almighty 
God to teach me how I may deserve it. I went this 
evening to the Harmonic Society, at which I could not 
assist for want of my spectacles. The vice-president 
requested I would consider myself an honorary member 
while in town. The flutes are good, with four moder 
ately good violins, two tenors, two bass players, one 
telerably good and three excellent singers, who performed 
some charming trios of Doctor Calcott's, new to me, and 
composed for some affecting extracts from Ossian. The 
instrumental music was all old, and known to me. I 
passed a pleasant evening, and came away at 12. Next 
Thursday I shall take a part. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1807. 

Saw Burnet again this morning, and showed him Al 
ston's letter of guarantee, which I assigned to Sanders, 
and is now returned to me, by his agent Nicholas, with 
the latter's receipt indorsed upon it for Alston's paper, 
which he has taken in satisfaction of his principal's 
demand. I have written to Lewis, to state this settle 
ment, and hope it will restore my credit with his house, 
from whence I have requested a remittance of $200, as 
I am in debt and without funds. Court, to-day, was 
occupied with further arguments on Botts's points. I 
heard Wirt for the first time. He is a handsome speaker, 
but faulty in his figures, rather through defect of study 
than genius. Edmon-d Randolph followed on the other 
tide; he has suffered a depression, in manner and 



400 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

matter, of fully one-half, since I saw him display here 
in 1800. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1807. 

Randolph finished his argument this morning, and was 
as labored, inanimate and uninteresting as on yesterday. 
He advanced nothing new, except an objection to the in 
dictments not setting forth with sufficient certainty that 
the expedition was carried on from the United States, 
pursuant to the manner in which the offense is described 
in the statute ; as he insisted, in the present indictment, 
the words " from thence " referred to the Island, and not 
to the United States. The point seemed to me a good 
one, and the Chief Justice took a note of it. Martin 
followed for two hours, and was, besides being clear in 
his positions, though, as usual, totally regardless of ar 
rangement, less cumbrous than in common with his 
verbiage. But Wickham, who closed on that side, ex 
hibited a masterpiece of strong, condensed argumenta 
tion, followed with a severe, but measured philippic on 
the motives, ignorance and misconduct of the prose 
cutors. This occasioned such agitation to Hay, who was 
alone hardy enough, of the three on that side, to with 
stand the impression, that he declared his feelings ought 
no.t to be trusted with the duty imposed on him, to offer 
remarks on expressions so unprovoked and unmerited, 
which Mr. Wickham would retract. He therefore re 
quested to be heard on Monday ; the Court then immedi 
ately adjourned. But I trust the Judge will not allow 
Hay to prove what he can alone do ; namely, Tutius est 
igitur fictis contendere verbis quam pugnare manu. I have 



NO CAPITAL. 401 

this evening progressed with letters to A. Martin, so long 
delayed. (See notes of the 29th ult.) Should I ever suc 
ceed to the large estates which Martin supposes now awaits 
me, who would imagine, that did not know my indiffer 
ence to wealth, I should be so careless of it. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1807. 

I was this morning informed by Mr. "Walton, a gentle 
man had arrived in town last night from the country, 
who had come a considerable distance to see me, and 
would call at 9 o'clock. I therefore staid within to 
receive him certain it must be either Mr. Hendren or 
O'Hennessy and was called upon to the minute, when a 
stranger appeared somewhat agitated. I inquired whether 
it was Mr. O'Hennessy I had the pleasure to receive, and 
being answered in the affirmative, I invited him up stairs. 
This man, I soon found, who had seen me only once or 
twice in Kerry, when I was one of the counsel attending 
John Crosbie's election, I believe, in 1793, who had never 
spoken a word to me in his life until this day, has suf 
fered many a sleepless night through his anxiety for me 
under the present prosecutions, and the first moment he 
learned he could have a chance of seeing me, he set out 
and rode 105 miles for the purpose. This is not all ; he 
intreats me to suffer him to follow me to any indefinite 
distance, declaring he regards it as the first object of his 
heart to settle near me. He has no capital; but, as a 
schoolmaster and a skillful dealer in horses, can command 
the means of a comfortable livelihood any where in 
America. At Natchez he can soon get rich. He will, 

therefore, accompany me with a Mr. O'Connor, a mathe- 
26 



402 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS 

matician, who will follow his fortune, so that I have 
secured a good tuition for my boys in the dead languages, 
English, and the elementary branches of the sciences, 
until a prospect of bettter means for their advancement 
may be more clearly opened in Europe the only con 
tingency that can draw me from the Mississippi. O'Hen- 
nessy has besought me to command a fine horse, and 
what money he can raise. The latter I have thankfully 
declined. I visited Burr this morning ; he is as gay as 
usual, and as busy in speculations on reorganizing his 
projects for action as if he had never suffered the least 
interruption. He observed to Major Smith and me, that 
in six months our schemes could be all remounted ; that 
we could now new-model them in a better mould than 
formerly, having a clearer view of the ground, and a 
^more perfect knowledge of our men. We were silent, 
feeling the full force of his last remark on men ; which, 
however, we did not fail, I believe, duly to apply both to 
him and ourselves. It should yet be granted, that if 
Burr possessed sensibilities of the right sort, with one- 
hundredth part of the energies for which, with many, he 
has obtained such ill-grounded credit, his first and last 
determination, with the morning and the night, should 
be the destruction of those enemies who have so long 
and so cruelly wreaked their malicious vengeance upon 
him. But time will prove him as incapable in all his 
future efforts as he has been in the past. Honest Hen- 
nessy dined and spent the evening with me. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1807. 
Major Smith, soon after breakfast, brought me a letter 



HAY UNHORSED. 403 

from the office, from my wife, dated the llth ult. This 
letter, too, has announced to me, through the favor of a 
preserving Providence, the good health of my wife and 
boys, up to that date. I dare not, then, indulge a wish 
to lament the grief occasioned her hy my arrest in Lex 
ington, and the anguish that has festered in her breast 
from her reflections on the severity of my confinement in 
the Dog-days. To-day, the Chief Justice has delivered 
an able, full, and luminous opinion as ever did honor to 
a judge, which has put an end to the present prosecution. 
But I have no doubt the prosecuting counsel will show 
their ignorance and malevolence by carping at it as they 
did at the other in the treason case. The jury must to 
morrow deliver a verdict of acquittal Hay, in the mean 
time, having prayed the Court to adjourn, to give time to 
study the opinion, and thereby shape his future course. 
But in this he could not avoid showing his petulance, by 
pretending the prosecutors should exclusively be accom 
modated with the opinion, which he would not say, when 
he would return to the other side. An application, how 
ever, from Botts, to have it left with the clerk for the 
benefit of both parties, corrected this insolence, under 
which Mr. Hay sunk as usual. O'Hennessy could not 
leave town to-day until he heard the opinion, and saw 
Burr, to whom I introduced him in court. He was 
highly delighted with both, and again visited me after 
dinner, and will return to Amherst county to-morrow I 
mean as far toward it, of his 105 miles, as he can. I 
have this evening progressed further in my letter to A. 
Martin. 



404 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1807. 

Saw Burnet, this morning, who tells me he has given 
such information to D. "Woodbridge as will probably in 
duce him to become bail to the attachment against me at 
suit of Miller, by which I hope to procure time enough 
for Burr or Alston to settle that demand, and exonerate 
my property at Marietta from it. The prosecutors, still 
true to evil purposes and malicious designs, attempted to 
day to get rid of the prosecution against Burr by a nolle 
prosequi. This produced an argument, in which they 
were overthrown, having nothing to rely upon on their 
side but a dictum in Fosters Treatise on Homicide. The 
jury were ordered out, and after an insidious attempt, but 
which failed, with one of them to bring in a special ver 
dict, they returned into court, in half an hour, with a 
general verdict of acquittal. Hay then said he would to 
morrow enter nolle prosequis on Smith's and my indict 
ments, and proceed with his motion to the Judge to com 
mit and transmit us all to some other district. All are 
busy in preparing for this new contest, in which I shall 
probably personally take a part, from want of instruc 
tions in my counsel, absence of witnesses, and other rea 
sons which will appear hereafter. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1807. 

On opening the court this morning, Hay, after some 
desultory conversation on both sides of the bar, exhibited 
a general charge against us in writing, of having levied 
war against the United States, at Cumberland Island, in 
Kentucky, at Bayou Pierre, on the Mississippi, or at 



BURR AGAIX. 405 

some intermediate place. We were all three, that is, 
Burr, Smith and myself, proposed to be subjected together 
to the inquiry, leaving it to the Judge to separate and 
apply to each such evidence of overt acts as the testimony 
might disclose. The Judge acquiesced in this proposition 
of Hay's, and one James McDowel was called, who 
proved nothing more at Cumberland than that Burr 
formed there a circle, and said, " he would not tell his 
secrets at that place." There are, however, a dozen 
other witnesses on the ground here who were at Cum 
berland at that time, and will swear that nothing of the 
sort took place there. Hay then attempted to examine 
as to facts in the Mississippi Territory, which called up, 
after some conversation, an argument on four points 
made by Botts ; namely, want of power in the Judge to 
transmit, under the judicial act; right of Burr to a bar 
by two acquittals here; his discharge by a grand jury 
already in Mississippi Territory ; and all his acts taken 
together constituting but one offense, for which he has 
already been tried and acquitted, within a district which 
the prosecutors have selected out of the whole for the 
purpose. Botts was very able and perspicuous in opening 
the argument, which Burr very neatly summed up and 
condensed, before the Court adjourned, about half-past 3. 
I had no opportunity that presented the least necessity 
for my rising, and think that will probably be the case 
until the motion for our recommitment is disposed of and 
defeated altogether. I was glad to find that Burr had at 
last thought of asking us to dine with him, as I was 
rather curious again to see him shine in a partie quarrie, 
consisting of new characters. We, therefore, walked 



406 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

with him from court, Luther Martin, who lives with 
him, accompanying us. We found but one other face 
that was strange to us, and a foreigner, who, I hoped, 
might turn out to he Bollman. Martin, hy the way, 
told me, " he thanked his God he should not now labor 
under the lock-jaw, which had hitherto restrained him 
before Democratic juries. He should now be no longer 
tongue-tied." Our foreigner was very taciturn and re 
served, and turned out to be a cousin of Judge Prevost's, 
and of the same name. The dinner was neat, and fol 
lowed by three or four kinds of wine splendid poverty ! 
During the chit-chat after the cloth was removed, a letter 
was handed to Burr, next to whom I sat. I immediately 
smelt musk. Burr broke the seal, put the cover to his 
nose, and then handed it to me, saying, " This amounts 
to a disclosure." I smelt the paper, and said, "indeed I 
think so." His whole physiognomy now assumed an 
alteration and vivacity that, to a stranger who had never 
seen him before, would have sunk full fifteen years of his 
age. " This," said he, " reminds me of a detection once 
very neatly practiced upon me in New York. One day a 
lady stepped into my library while I was reading, came 
softly behind my chair, and giving me a slap on the 
cheek, said, ' Come, tell me directly what little French 
girl, pray, have you had here ? ' The abruptness of the 
question and surprise left me little reason to doubt the 
discovery had been completely made ; so I thought it best 
to confess the whole fact, upon which the inquisitress 
burst out into a loud laugh on the success of her artifice, 
which she was led to play off upon me, from the mere 
circumstance of having smelt musk in the room." "We 



ARGUMENTS HEARD. 407 

all applauded this anecdote as it deserved; but I have 
given it a place here only to convey an idea of that tem 
perament and address which enabled this character on 
certain occasions, like the snake, to cast his slough, and, 
through age and debauchery, seem to uphold his ascend 
ancy over the sex. After some time, Martin and Prevost 
withdrew, and we passed to the topics of our late adven 
tures on the Mississippi, on which Burr said little, but 
declared he did not know of any reason to blame Jack 
son, of Tennessee, for any thing he had done or omitted. 
He has not heard of J.'s letter to Claiborne, which Wat- 
kins talked so much about in the executive council at 
Orleans, on the question respecting the legislative memo 
rial to Government. Such a general may well continue 
to sacrifice to Venus, rather than to Mars; but he de 
clares he will not lose a day after the favorable issue of 
the present contest at the capitol, of which he has no 
doubt to devote his entire attention to settling up his 
projects, which have only been suspended on a better 
model ; in which work, he says, he has even here already 
made some progress. Martin presented Smith and my 
self each with his portrait, tolerably engraved, as he had 
long since promised. I intend to have it neatly framed 
by Prichard. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1807. 

This morning, the Court heard a continuation of the 
arguments on both sides, which lasted until 5 o'clock this 
evening, when Randolph begged the Judge to indulge 
him with about an hour's hearing to-morrow morning, 
promising that he would show, under the Constitution 



408 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and the spirit and genius of the laws of their country, 
that the Court could not comply with Hay's present 
motion, to have us again committed and transmitted to 
another district. Of the success of such an attempt I can 
see no prospect, even if the Judge should be of opinion, 
contrary to what has been so ably contended by Burr's 
counsel, that the Court has a power to commit under the 
judicial act; as a total failure of evidence to prove any 
overt act upon us must undermine the motion. I spent 
the evening at the Harmonic Society, where I took a part 
in a symphony and a quartette by Pleyel, but with less 
effect than if I had been provided with my own specta 
cles. I had the pleasure of meeting there Neville, Spence 
and other visitors ; besides hearing several good glees, in 
some of which a Miss Coniers took the upper part. She 
is a very pretty girl, and is said by Neville to be accom 
plished. The society broke up, however, early the music 
not producing the best effect, from the state of the 
weather, and the room being too much crowded. I found 
an old letter in the Post-office, announcing protest of the 
bill held some time since by Luckett, with my indorse 
ment for $2,500, so that every thing that little shop 
keeper had told me of no proceedings having ever been 
taken against me, as an indorser, was utterly false. I 
was called upon this evening by David Meade, who 
seriously assured me that vicious partisan, Scot, the Mar 
shal, had been trying to make a bargain with him to 
undertake the office of a Deputy, for the purpose of re- 
conducting us to Kentucky, anticipating the success of 
the present motion, though Hay has certainly said out c f 
court, this evening, he does not expect he shall succee 1. 



DOUBTFUL POSITION. 409 

Such are the tricks of these jugglers, in and out of 
court. Midnight. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1807. 

Randolph kept his promise this morning, so far as 
making out his hour, but did little more service, having 
offered nothing new, except one argument to show that 
where a man had been charged for the same murder in 
different States, the law arising upon his acquittal in the 
first was different from what it would be on an acquittal 
of an overt act of the same treason in the first district, 
where the offender was tried. Then the Judge delivered 
his opinion, condensing the four points made by Botts 
within the observations he made on two of them ; 
namely, power of the Court under the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, to arrest and transmit to a 
Territory, which he decided in the negative ; and the 
effect of Burr's acquittal, which, he hoped, it would not 
be necessary for him to decide upon, as he should prefer 
a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
It followed, as he laid it down from this adjudication, that 
the prosecutors might adduce any evidence in their power 
to prove any overt acts against us, Burr included, com 
mitted any where in the United States, to authorize him 
to transmit us to any district thereof. But, does it not 
thence follow, that a persecuting and vindictive Govern 
ment may order its attorney to harrass an obnoxious, but 
innocent, victim of its wrath, by playing off the farce of 
a prosecution against him, in a district of its own selec 
tion, without effect, and afterward ruin him, by dragging 
him through every other district in the Union ? "What 



410 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

better answer can be given to this supposition tban say 
ing such a case is rendered improbable, by supposing no 
government will be wicked enougb to contrive such a 
villainy ? But this is begging the question. I have here 
put a case, which has not been supposed at the bar ; but, 
with very little alteration, it is our own case. How long 
is it since the prosecutors began to digest all the infor 
mation it collected by the most illicit means, from the 
most foul sources, not of our acts, but of our designs, 
before we committed any acts? Did they not order 
prosecutions fifteen hundred miles from the present ? Did 
they not make two selections of their ground, besides an 
attempt at a third, by Graham, their agent, or at his in 
stance as a spy and informer, in the State of Ohio, which 
was only avoided by my flight, and after having failed in 
all of proof, do they not now seek to drag us back again 
to the same district where they have already miscarried 
and failed in every thing, but the success of the plunder 
and outrage committed on my family and property, by 
informers and personal enemies the dregs of all the 
human society in my absence, when I had incurred no 
forfeiture ? 

The Judge having further declared the prosecutors 
might now proceed with their evidence, they called up 
James McDowel, who swore to some unimportant state 
ments, which, if necessary, we can disprove by a dozen 
witnesses. But they attempted repeatedly to go into 
evidence, not only of alleged facts, but even of declara 
tions of third persons, to prove overt acts and designs 
within the United States ; and the Judge, for reasons I 
can not imagine, seemed disposed to countenance the pro- 



PARTIALITY. 411 

ceeding, which is certainly in direct hostility with his 
own opinion this day delivered ; unless as a committing 
magistrate, he thinks he ought to indulge a greater lati 
tude of investigation than he would permit on a trial. 
But to-morrow's proceedings will further elucidate these 
matters. 10 o'clock, P. M. 

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1807. 

Strickland called upon me before the sitting of the 
Court this morning, to say he should in two hours set off 
for Natchez. I wrote a short letter to Harding, to give 
him some account of my situation, and tell him I hoped 
the present demands of the Government on our persons 
would he satisfied on Monday ; after which, I hoped to 
be at Marietta in fifteen or sixteen days, whence I should 
proceed to Natchez as speedily as my affairs would per 
mit. But I since regret to find, from the complexion 
of affairs in court to-day, that our detention may yet ex 
tend even to a month, unless our counsel shall succeed, in 
efforts they will not cease to make, to confine the prose 
cutors within the limits of the established rules of evi 
dence, and the adjudications already pronounced by the 
Court ; for this whole day was spent in arguments and 
altercations in violation of both. This was chiefly occa 
sioned by the prosecutors persisting in the conduct they 
pursued yesterday, which produced a corresponding op 
position, which I lamented to see the Judge not only 
permit, but in some degree participate in ; for instance, 
Dunbaugh was allowed to-day to testify to facts at and 
below Bayou Pierre, while two or three witnesses yes 
terday were always stopped, with the concurrence of 



412 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the Court, as often as they attempted to speak of any 
thing without the lines of the United States. How this 
is reconcilable with the opinion of the Court, I have yet 
to learn. Altercations on points already settled, or on a 
series of topics, where the contest is a logomachy, have 
always a narcotic influence on me. Nor could any sense 
of the interest I had in the consequences, or any stimulus 
the ingenuity of Wickham or Botts could apply to all 
the intensity of my admiration of their talents, prevent 
my passing the day in a sort of doze ? Burr, I observed, 
seemed so irritated with the Judge's apparent incon 
sistency with himself, that he would not trust himself 
to rise to sum up and condense the forces displayed by 
his counsel, into compact columns, after the engagement, 
toward the close of the day, as is generally his practice. 
He has no fear of the final result, but feels what a 
mortifying check he has received. 

SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1807. 

I proposed this morning to devote the entire day to 
writing, my attendance in court through the week totally 
preventing almost the whole of the labor demanded of 
my pen. But a solicitude to confer separately with Burr 
and Mercer, on the course indulged to the prosecutors by 
the Court the last two days, forced me to go in quest of 
those so oppositely interesting characters : and the debts 
yet unpaid, that laid so heavy a burden on my reflections, 
which I wanted to discharge to Mrs. Gamble, Mrs. Chev 
alier and Col. de Pestre, who had long been confined with 
the influenza, hurried me out of doors immediately after 
breakfast. I found Burr, just after a consultation with

his counsel, secretly writhing under much irritation at 
the conduct of the Judge, but affecting an air of contempt 
for his alleged inconsistency, as he asserted His Honor did 
not for two days understand either the questions or him 
self; had wavered in his opinions "before yesterday's ad 
journment, and should in future be put right by strong 
language, I am afraid to say abuse, though I think I 
could swear he used that word, on the part of the de 
fense. I observed, that though I believed the Judge's 
the purest of all human hearts, I could not, in my best 
judgment, reconcile the latitude he permitted the prose 
cutors, either with the letter or spirit of his last opinion 
delivered on Friday. Burr replied nothing to my offer 
of tribute to the Judge's heart, but said his Burr's 
opinion should draw him back from his deviations from 
it, and he would hang him, not so facetiously, indeed, as 
Eaton swore he would hang Miranda, but upon every 
comma of his opinion. He then inquired where Mercer 
was, and expressed a strong desire to know his thoughts 
on the Judge's late conduct. I answered, "that I had 
come out chiefly to gratify the same desire, and should 
go directly to seek Mercer." I left Smith with him, and 
took leave. I bent my way to Mr. Chevalier's, to see De 
Pestre, whom I found at home. Mrs. Chevalier received 
me very kindly, and prevailed on her husband, who was 
confined to his room, to come down stairs to see me, and 
beg of me to partake of a family dinner with them, 
which I accepted. After an hour's conversation, I then 
made a visit to Mrs. Gamble, who seems a most amiable 
old lady, and so fraught with the generous humanity 
characteristic of her sex, as to suffer not the connections

of her daughters, Mrs. Cabell, the Governor's wife, and 
Mrs. Wirt, to prevent her expressing not merely a con 
cern for the general hardships we have suffered, but even 
to censure the last two days' proceedings in court. I was 
not fortunate enough to find Mercer before I returned to 
Chevalier's to dinner, where I spent a pleasant evening, 
save so far as Mr. Chevalier was not of our company, 
being confined to his bed. Mrs. C. is as lively and agree 
able as it is possible for any woman to be with limited 
endowments and without beauty. I had an hour's inter 
esting conversation by means of a walk before tea with 
De Pestre in the garden, which, however, touched on no 
new matters, except his informing me that Mrs. Alston 
had expressed to him a wish that he would engage in 
nothing before next spring that might prevent her father 
from having an opportunity of forming another connec 
tion with him, conveying an intimation which he avoided 
as delicately as he could. We again harmonized in repro 
bation of Alston, in every point of view, when I hinted to 
the Colonel some expectations and reasons I entertained 
for urging Burr or Alston to give me an obligation, if 
they can't raise money, for the amount of my losses by 
them, yet unsatisfied, which he approved of. He will 
spend some time with me to-morrow evening, when we 
will prosecute our thoughts. 

I visited Mr. C. in his bedroom, after tea, for awhile, 
and on my return home, I learned from Smith, a confirma 
tion of what De Pestre had already mentioned to me, that 
Burr sets off immediately for England, after his libera 
tion from the present motion before the Court, to collect 
money for reorganizing his projects, which I now r have 



SUSPICIONS. 415 

ascertained to be as baseless as the interests of the parties 
or persons to whom he discloses them are opposed or 
variant. For he assures his creditors here at least he 
has done so to Smith that when he raises money in 
England, he will not be strict in questioning demands 
upon him in this country, which he will fully discharge. 
In London, no doubt, he will pledge himself to appropri 
ate every guinea they will advance him to the promotion 
of such operations on this continent as will best serve the 
interests of Britain; and if he had not already exposed 
his duplicity and incapacity in his favorite art of intrigue 
to Yrujo, he would again as readily promise to advance, 
with Spanish dollars and Spanish arms, the fortunes of 
the Spanish minister and his master. But is it not a 
little strange that he should have never dropped even a 
hint to me of his projected trip to England. I have had 
more of his confidence than either Smith or De Pestre ; 
for he has insinuated to me that the former was not dis 
posed to fight on the Mississippi, when I thought he had 
the disposition not to do so himself; and he has, during 
our embarrassments on that river, through Wilkinson, 
spoken, in the presence of Major Smith, myself, and 
others, of the probability of De Pestre's being hanged, 
through failure of an enterprise he had sent him on, as 
an event which he treated with the utmost indifference. 
Surely I may repeat, that whatever feeling this man pos 
sesses, is confined within the sensuality of his tempera 
ment ; if indeed his conduct, in the eyes of all who really 
know him, does not warrant the suspicion of Cowles 
Meade, and fully prove, while the whole bar as little 
knew him as Col. Swartwout, whose attachment is still

unshaken, that there is at best but method in his mad 
ness. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1807. 

Dunbaugh was reproduced to-day, with no other effect 
than to contradict himself, by saying Burr communicated 
to him in secret his having been betrayed by Wilkinson, 
though he swore, on Saturday, Burr imparted to him no 
secrets. The Judge has noted enough in this witness to 
destroy all credit in his testimony. The day passed in 
the examination of other witnesses called by prosecutors, 
whose evidence was altogether favorable to us, though I 
was mortified to see the Judge, considering himself as an 
examining magistrate, open so wide the door to the wan 
ton discretion of the prosecutors, as to allow them to offer 
testimony of any sort, which they alleged to be explan 
atory of the so-called overt acts on Cumberland Island, at 
which place, it is confessed, the assemblage, at most, was 
doubtful or equivocal in its character. I can not com 
prehend the distinction taken by the Court between ad 
missible and operative evidence; nor do any of the bar 
here, I believe, perceive how evidence that can not oper 
ate upon the subject be admissible. It seems to me, that 
perhaps the Judge has at last thought it necessary to sac 
rifice a little to public prejudice, when the concession can 
not cause any serious consequences in the issue of this 
strange contest. This evening De Pestre spent an hour 
with me, which was passed in a more dilated view of his 
past concerns with Burr. He gave me a description of 
the manners and character of Yrujo, who is reconfirmed 
in his embassy to this country, in spite of all the efforts 
of this Government for his removal. This minister is, 



BURR'S MANAGEMENT. 417 

according to De Pestre's portrait of him, a shrewd politi 
cian, who pierced the cohweb tissues of Burr's intrigues 
with him at a single glance. Though he assured De 
Pestre, who was charged in Kentucky, last October, with 
a special mission to him, that had Burr opened his designs 
with frankness, and really projected a severance of the 
Union, and nothing hostile to the Spanish provinces, he, 
Burr, might have had an easy resort to the Spanish treas 
ury and its arsenals, while his confidence would have been 
safely lodged in the honor of a Spanish nobleman. But 
Yrujo laughed at the awkwardness with which Burr en 
deavored to mask his designs on Mexico, and expressed 
his concern for De Pestre's having lost his time in such a 
service. But Burr, if he had capacity or money for re 
animating his projects, has lost a season never to be 
recalled. He might, last winter, have had the whole 
equipage of two French ships of war, who offered to 
bring their small arms with them into his services. If 
he had not talents, or spirits to use them, he is where 
he should "bje. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1807. 

A variety of witnesses, examined to-day by the prosecu 
tors, seem to me to advance their cause but little, though 
their newspapers pretend they throw great light on the 
mysterious proceedings of Burr. But his mysteriousness 
is surely an impenetrable shield to cover his treasonable 
designs, if he had any. I have seen a complete file of all 
the depositions made before the grand jury in Burr's pos 
session. It must be confessed tbat few other men in his 

circumstances could have procured these documents out

of the custody of offices filled by his inveterate enemies. 
I have long been at a loss to imagine the means he used, 
of which I am not yet fully informed. But I have learned 
accidentally that Skelton Jones has become friendly to 
him. This Jones, a noted duelist, the brother of the late 
Reviewer, and he who formerly conducted the Examiner, 
an influential Democrat, I am told, received a letter some 
time since from Burr, covering a bank-note, without 
specifying for what purpose the money was sent. Jones 
returned it, with civil remonstrance, which gave Burr an 
opportunity of requesting an interview, which, if it did 
not succeed in removing the easy scruples of this honor 
able patriot, has, however, since that event, completely 
attached Mr. J.'s interest, as I have learned from a Mr. 
Braxton, a young lawyer here of some talents. Burr has 
again asserted to-day, in court, that he expects, by the 
mail, documents to enable him to show that Eaton must 
be an incompetent witness in any court. This, if estab 
lished, will give the coup de grace to the fame of the Der- 
nean hero, who, I am assured by Robison, has sworn the 
peace against a Mr. Smith, of Petersburgh, who threat 
ened to kick this General out of the room; and yet he 
appears every day in court, affecting by his looks an air of 
defiance. Wilkinson also exhibits his boasted arrogance, 
sometimes in the same place. But his examination can 
not come on for some days. When it takes place, it must 
be of the highest interest in the eyes of those who, know 
ing his character and the insidiously artful deposition he 
has made before the grand jury, will contemplate a spec 
tacle of depravity seldom equaled ; while such a sum 
mons to the address, I will not yet add the firmness of

Burr, will leave no nerve untouched. But /may venture 
to predict that Burr will sink under it. For, apart from 
the merits or demerits of either, there are reasons why it 
should be so in this country, if not in any other upon 
earth, which I will unfold at large hereafter. I find by D. 
Woodbridge, many people have died at Marietta, within 
two months past, of a malignant disease prevailing there. 
Did God's mercy place us elsewhere ? Midnight. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1807. 

It chiefly engaged my attention in court to-day to hear 
Burr contend, that conversations by me with others, 
respecting him while he was absent, and prior to the 
period of any alleged acts, should not affect him. This 
attempt was made to obviate the effect he apprehended 
from the testimony of the Hendersons ; but the Judge was 
pleased to overrule it. Woodbridge has expressed some 
wish to be discharged, and return with Belknap to Mari 
etta, but assures me he will still wait until the whole 
affair is finished, or while he can be of any service to me. 
I have begged he may not, observing, his being my bail 
need not detain him ; and have told him, at the same 
time, to take no trouble on my account, etc. He seems 
satisfied, as I have informed him of the fact of General 
Dayton having gone to Ohio, though not discharged from 
his recognizance. 

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1807. 

This morning I was treated to the narrative of Sandy 
Henderson, which is considered to bear more particularly 
on me than any other testimony. I had projected a long 



420 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

cross-examination of him, which I should have pursued 
with good effect, but our counsel feared it might operate 
quite contrary to my expectations from the uniform ex 
perience they have, that within these virtuous States, 
when once witnesses determine to swear for a purpose, 
all attempts to involve them in inconsistency only tend 
to render them more desperate. I therefore agreed to 
postpone my cross-examination until the next day, that I 
might, in the meaii time, confer with Mr. Wickham on 
the subject, as he feared, I suppose, that something might 
break out injurious to Burr, through my pressing Hender 
son ; and Mr. Botts, from his' connection with that family, 
wished to be excused from taking any part in this exam 
ination. I had here another check, from the obligations 
Mr. Botts has already imposed upon me. But I assured 
him I had discovered his connection too late to prevent 
his having been concerned for me. It was yesterday I 
should have mentioned as having seen Henderson first 
called, and in consequence of the difficulties affecting 
Wickham on account of Burr, and myself on account of 
Botts, I last night drew up a series of interrogatories, 
which I wished Henderson to answer upon affidavit by 
consent, with which I called upon Wickham in the even 
ing. He also conferred with Burr upon them ; all ap 
proved of the questions, but still feared the effect of them, 
from the apprehended hostility of the witness; so that 
we concluded on one only of them, which we put to him 
this morning in court: namely, "whether, at the time of 
my alleged communications to him, he did not, and doth 
not yet, entertain a strong prejudice against Col. Burr?" 
which he answered in the affirmative. I met this even- 



MORE EVIDENCE. 421 

ing with an introduction, at the Harmonic Society, to a 
very handsome woman, a Mrs. Meyio, who has been too 
many years a widow, though I hear she is soon to be 
married. I mention her as being the niece of the amia 
ble and highly esteemed Mrs. Carrington, whom I have 
not yet visited to thank her for her generous offer, more 
than once made through Mercer, to send me refresh 
ments to the Penitentiary. I took a part in a quartette 
of Haydn's, and in a glee, and returned home after mid 
night. 

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1807. 

Yesterday, John Henderson gave his testimony to the 
same effect Sandy had done, and underwent little or no 
examination. John Graham also delivered his to the 
same purport with that he gave against me, before Toul- 
min and Rodney. But, in cross-examining him, I asked 
him to say " who was to pay the $1,000 for forfeiting his 
recognizance to appear to prosecute me in the Mississippi 
Territory:" he applied to the Court to be excused answer 
ing this question ; denied he had applied to Col. Scott to 
invite A. Burr to his house to dinner to have him kid 
napped, and said, he has got his present office of chief 
clerk in the Secretary of State's office, lately. To-day, 
after consultation with our counsel, I agree to waive ob 
jections I had offered against reading the "Querist" in 
print, or Henderson's evidence of my having shown him 
only a manuscript of a composition by me with such 
signature. The reading of the fourth number by the 
prosecutors, with examination of Dana and Gilmore, 
finished the day.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1807. 

To-day, the long-expected examination of Wilkinson 
came on, after that of Eaton, upon matter and conversa 
tions between him and Burr, which had been excluded as 
improper evidence on the trial-in-chief, but was now 
thought admissible before the Judge as an examining 
magistrate. I have taken, I believe, faithful notes of 
every thing that fell from both of these persons, by which 
it will appear that Eaton's testimony is indefinite as to 
any bearing that it should have upon Burr's designs, 
without seeking for those inconsistencies with his former 
story before the grand jury, and on the trial-in-chief, 
which Martin, under the signature of " Investigator," is 
endeavoring to establish in the Virginia Gazette here. 
The General exhibited the manner of a serjeant under a 
court-martial, rather than the demeanor of an accusing 
officer confronted with his culprit. His perplexity and 
derangement, even upon his direct examination, has 
placed beyond all doubt " his honor as a soldier, and his 
fidelity as a citizen." It will appear from the gauntlet 
he has begun to run, which he will not finish before 
Monday evening, that he has confessed he altered a du 
plicate of the original cipher letter for the express purpose 
of erasing from it an acknowledgment by Burr, of 
Burr's having received a letter from him, Wilkinson, of 
the 27th of February ; that this was done for the avowed 
purpose of concealing from the Legislature of Orleans a 
part of that letter, from which that body might infer that 
he was privy to, or concerned in, the projects of Burr; 
that he substituted other words in ' the room of the 



ADJOURNMENT. 423 

erasure as a translation of the erased ciphers afterward,' 
but at what time he could not recollect ; that the transla 
tion of the document sent to Government was from this 
mutilated original ; and that he had sworn, by an affidavit 
he produced himself in court, that such translation faith 
fully rendered the substance of the original. On the 
other hand, Burr, who was very unwell, preserved a com 
posure, inspired by Wilkinson's self-condemnation, and 
supported by his indisposition, contrary to the expecta 
tions I had formed a few days past. The cross-examina 
tion progressed but a little way, and was adjourned until 
Monday. Yesterday evening, Woodbridge called upon 
me in the most abrupt manner, to repeat to me what he 
had before observed on Wednesday evening, that he was 
very desirous to return home, and hoped I would that 
evening look out for other bail. But he hardly allowed 
me time to answer, " that I would, and whether I suc 
ceeded or not, I wished him not to stay a moment on my 
account," before he had the unfeeling ingratitude to add, 
" that if I did not, he should give me up in the morning." 
I was accordingly prepared on the opening of the court 
this morning, to state to the Judge, " that Mr. Wood- 
bridge was about to be discharged ; but previous to his 
leaving town he wished also to be discharged from the 
recognizance he had entered into on my account, for 
reasons I did not inquire into; that it thence became 
necessary I should find other securities, or be recommitted, 
of which I should prefer the latter, rather than solicit 
bail in a place where I was almost an utter stranger. 
But I believe two citizens of this place were voluntarily 
attending, for the purpose of entering with me into 



424 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

another recognizance. John Banks and a Mr. A 

then were called forward, and thus ended, I wish I could 
say my last concern, with the Woodbridge family. Of 
Dudley, it must not he concealed, that although he is 
reputed to have given a fair, candid, and to us advan 
tageous testimony, he has not yet told the whole truth- 
having suppressed my communication to him of our 
designs being unequivocally against Mexico, which I 
suppose he kept back, because he embraced and em 
barked in the plan on the first mention of it to him, 
though he afterward receded from it, upon his own re 
flections or the counsels of others.* 

SUNDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1807. 

While at breakfast, this morning, I received a verbal 
message from Burr, importing that he wanted to see me. 
On my arrival soon after at his house, I found him in 
bed. He informed me he wanted to see me, to know 
what I would advise him to do in his complaint, observ 
ing, he had no confidence in the physicians here. I sug 
gested to him my being of the same opinion, unless I 
excepted McClung, whom I believed to be a man of some 
genius, and probably possessing considerable skill in his 
profession. Burr said he was a creature of rule; and 
calling again for my opinion, I said I would have some 
pills made up for him, which he could take for two or 
three nights. I left him to go to the druggist's, where I 
had the medicine carefully prepared, which I sent him 



* The integrity and respectability of Mr. Woodbridge is undoubted by all who knew him. 
From a personal acquaintance for some years previous to his death, I am enabled to add, that 
euch was the purity of his character, through a long and useful career, as to stamp with un- 
iruthfulness any reflection upon his honor as a man or his veracity as a witness. 



INTERVIEW SOLICITED. 425 

about two o'clock, accompanied with a note conveying 
directions for his diet, and the use of the medicine. I 
called there again in the evening to see him ; hut while I 
was engaged in the parlor with several persons, where 
Martin was reading to us a heavy manuscript of his next 
Investigator, I found on going into Burr's bedroom, soon 
after Martin had done, that he had just taken, instead of 
my medicine, a dose of laudanum. He said he felt so 
weak, and was in such want of rest, he thought it best to 
take an opiate. I told him he must then omit my pills 
for this night, wished him good rest, and took leave. 
On my return to the parlor, Baker told me a Mr. Smith, 
who knew my family in Ireland, and might probably 
recognize me, solicited him to bring us together. "He 
should accordingly bring Mr. Smith, with my leave, to 
my lodgings." I assented, and thanked him. He also 
acquainted me that Mrs. Broughenbrough, commonly 
called Brokenberry here, who is regarded as the nearest 
approximation in this town to a savante and bel-esprit, has 
expressed no small solicitude, and has insisted that Hay 
will enable her to read the " Querist," which is much 
praised here. Martin boasts of the fourth number, not a 
little, as a piece of argumentation which the prosecutors 
had better conceal from the public, while they wish to 
keep them uninformed on the merits of the question re 
specting a severance of the Union. Martin has also 
assured me Judge Tucker, though a violent Democrat, 
seriously contended at a party, with Judge Marshall, in 
this town since May last, that any State in the Union is 
at any time competent to recede from the same, though 
Marshall strongly opposed this doctrine. I find Robin-

son, the only correct stenographer, who takes exact notes 
of all the proceedings at the capitol, and is besides a 
scholar, who understands five or six languages, will give 
the " Querist " a longer life by incorporating it in his book 
than it was likely to enjoy in the barren soil of the " Ohio 
Gazette," where it appeared to bloom but as an humble 
flower, and trampled under the feet of the sovereign peo 
ple. Baker is a young lawyer, whom Burr employs, 
more for the benefit of his influence out of doors than 
from the aid of talents or services in court, where he is 
only of use through his humor and the freedom with 
which he lavishes his abuse. I believe he possesses as 
good a heart as is permitted to a Democrat, and his 
spirits and popularity are perhaps, in effect, as valuable 
to Burr as the talents of "Wickham or Botts. 

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1807. 

I had, this morning, a long double letter from my 
adored wife. Its red seal was as welcome to my eyes 
as the evening star to the mariner after the agitation of 
a storm. For I had, last week, suffered no small anxiety 
from the want of a letter. But the seal, notwithstanding 
its color, and every curve and turn of the letters in the 
superscription, had long passed under jealous inspection, 
to undergo every scrutiny from which I could augur the 
import of the intelligence within, before I would venture 
to break it open. But I was assured by the seal there 
was no mortality, at least on the -5th ult., as by the post 
mark. I trust, then, the heartfelt offerings of thanksgiv 
ing I tried to breathe forth to Heaven were borne to 
Almighty God, before I consulted the contents of the 



DREAMS. 427 

letter. There I soon saw how industriously my beloved 
continued to practice the only fraud her pure soul is capa 
ble of conceiving that of endeavoring to hide from me 
all she feels for me, and has suffered for our dear boys. 
Her complaint in her chest is mentioned in a way to alarm 
me, through the vail of disguise she has attempted to 
throw over it. But the weekly reports she will not fail 
to see of the criminal proceedings here, will, I trust, 
lighten much of the anxiety she labors under, which, I 
know, so much aggravates the affection in her breast. I 
next find my boys have, both of them, had fevers ; and 
my dear Harman, who has suffered most, was perhaps at 
the height of his disease, about the period when I last 
dreamed I had lost him, and has perhaps been spared to 
us, through the merits of his incomparable mother, which 
have not been beheld with the less favor of Providence, 
while I was offering up my prayers, in the Penitentiary, 
for his preservation. I have, I find, in concluding my 
notes of the 2d inst., observed, I again dreamt I had lost 
my Harman. Did my first dream of his irrecoverable 
injury from a dog typify the disease of which he was to 
suffer ? and did my second dream, which was visited upon 
me in the Penitentiary, a night or two before I noted it on 
the 2d inst., come upon me as another vision to announce, 
perhaps, a relapse he has undergone, since his mother's 
letter of the 25th ult. was written. These things are 
only known to the Eternal and All-wise Dispenser of 
our mortality. But while reason shall continue my only 
guide to faith, I will yet wonder in mysterious awe of 
such dreams as these, which my understanding can not 
scan, while they appal my heart. If I shall be blessed 



428 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

with the sight of another red seal riext Monday, I shall 
put off a heavy burden of anxiety which now oppresses 
me. The Court does not sit to-day, on account of Burr's 
illness. I find he is much worse than yesterday. He says 
he will take my medicine to-night, and has rejected bleed 
ing, proposed to him by McClung, in which I fully agreed 
with him that he should not part with his blood, even at 
a Joe a drop. I called upon De Pestre, this morning, at 
Mr. Chevalier's, where Mr. C. kindly pressed me to dine 
en famille, which I declined, through a desire to write at 
home and attend a private quartette-party at the Har 
monic Society's room this evening. The invitation of 
Chevalier was given in the most friendly manner, with a 
reprobation of the restriction imposed on the hospitable 
dispositions of the families of this town by the effects of 
a system of espionage, which is kept up by Government 
and its agents to a degree that has generally prevented 
those attentions we should otherwise receive. This must 
be the case, as I have not received a visit from any family- 
man, much less an invitation, since my release from im 
prisonment, though Mr. Pickett, who lives in the first 
style here, informed my landlord, Walton, the other day, 
he means to invite me to his house. So that etiquette 
seems also to be totally disregarded ; and, no doubt, here, 
as in other countries, a want of better breeding is received 
by strangers as a proof of inhospitality not merited. 

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1807. 

Jurr took my medicine last night as he promised, 
rested well, and is much better this morning. But he 
has prudently declined attending court, though he is evi- 



CORRUPTION. 429 

dently mortified, he is not able to witness the progress of 
his recrimination of Wilkinson, conducted by his counsel, 
in which he is so desirous to take a part, especially as 
Botts has retired to Fredericksburg, to attend to other 
professional calls upon him. I perused this morning, at 
Burr's, some interesting documents, forwarded to him 
from New Orleans by Ed. Livingston and Alexander, all 
tending to overtake Wilkinson with a portion of that re 
tributive justice he has so fairly earned. Of these papers, 
I trust the Chief Justice, in the spirit of that latitude he 
has so liberally permitted to the prosecutors, will, as an 
examining magistrate, allow the affidavits of Derbigeny 
and Mercier to be read, as both go to prove the Bri 
gadier's corruption in having received from Carondelet, 
in 1796, a douceur of $9,000 at Cincinnati, which, added 
to every thing else that will appear against him, should 
surely settle his integrity and credit, if not his admissi- 
bility as a witness.* On opening of the court, Graham 



* John Mercier, jun., of the city of New Orleans, being duly sworn, 
maketh oath, that he was one of the clerks in the office of the Governor 
in the time of the Spanish dominion, during a period of nine years, from 
the year 1792 to the year 1801. That while this deponent was employed 
in the said office, to-wit, in the years 1795 and 1796, a secret correspond 
ence was carried on in cipher between the said Governor, then the Baron 
de Carondelet, and some person of note, who then was in the western part 
of the United States, and, as this deponent believes, on the waters of the 
Ohio. That this deponent had no certain knowledge of the name of the 
said person, but that it was a matter of notoriety, among those who were 
employed in the said office, that the said person was General Wilkinson. 
That this deponent was intrusted with the care or charge of deciphering

ing some of the answers which were made to them by the Governor. That 
the cipher was understood by means of a small English dictionary ; and

the line where the word wras in the dictionary was made use of, instead

voluntarily came forward to explain a part of his testi 
mony, and, I know not why, was pleased to declare I had 
told him at Marietta, "that both Burr and myself per 
ceived the people were not ripe for a severance of the 
Union; that we should not hurry it, as it would take 
place from natural causes of itself, and we had no per- 

of the word itself. That this deponent very well recollects that the project 
treated of in the said correspondence was the dismembering of the West 
ern States and Territories from the Union, but that he is not able to recol 
lect the particulars. And this deponent further swears, that some time 
toward the end of the year 1795, Mr. Thomas Power, who was employed 
as the confidential agent of the Spanish Government for this secret nego 
tiation, was intrusted with a sum of nine thousand dollars, or thereabouts, 
destined for the said person, which sum was delivered to the said Power, 
in the office of the Governor, in the presence of this deponent. That the 
said Power set off with it, and, as this deponent believes, with the dis 
patches which were prepared on that occasion for the said person.

John McPonaugh, jun., being duly sworn, doth depose, that some time 
in the month of March, in the year 1804, General Wilkinson consulted with 
this deponent, as a commission merchant, on the probability of sugar or 
cotton shipped from this country to the Atlantic ports turning to advan 
tage. The advice of this deponent was, to ship sugars in preference; upon 
which the General requested this deponent to purchase for him sugars to 
the amount of nine or ten thousand dollars, payable in cash. This depo 
nent, accoi'dingly, purchased for the General, through Messrs. Dusan and 
Dubourg, brokers, one hundred and seven hogsheads of sugar, and char 
tered the ship Louisiana, in which the General took his passage, to transport 
it to New York, the said sugar being shipped on the sole risk and account 
of the General. That the amount of the said sugar, as invoiced, was eight 
thousand and forty-five dollars and thirty-five cents ; and this deponent 
gave the General a bill of exchange on New York for one thousand dollars, 
the sugars not amounting to the sums which the General risked to be in 
vested in them. That the amount of the said two sums, being $9,045 35, 
was paid to this deponent by the General, in Mexican dollars, and that 
some of the bags containing the said money were Mexican bags, such as 
come from Vera Cruz ; and this deponent recollects that the said purchase 
excited at the time much speculation among the American inhabitants of

sonal interest in the event." Then came on the little 
Brigadier, whose demeanor, to-day, was no doubt as op 
posite to that arrogance in which he strutted at Orleans, 
during the reign of his brief authority, as was the car 
riage of Dionysius at Corinth, compared with his royal 
port before at Syracuse. But I should not have degraded 

New Orleans, as to the resources of the General which enabled him to pay 
so large a sum of money in cash; and the Governor himself, some time 
after the departure of the General, spoke to this deponent upon the subject, 
appearing to be desirous of ascertaining the amount of the sugars which 
had been purchased, and the means by which the General had been enabled 
to pay for them. JOHN McDoNAUGH, JUN. 

Sworn before me, this 4th September, 1807, at the city of New Orleans. 

JOHN LYND, Justice of the Peace. 

Peter Derbigeny, of New Orleans, Counselor-at-Law, being sworn on 
the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, deposeth, that some time in the year 
1796, this deponent being then a resident at New Madrid, on the Missis 
sippi, Mr. Thomas Power, then employed by the Spanish Government on a 
private agency, went up the Ohio as far as Cincinnati, as this deponent 
was told, and returned some time afterward to New Madrid, in quest of a 
sum of money, which was delivered to him by Dr. Thomas Portall, the then 
commandant of that post. That this deponent was informed by a Spanish 
officer, on whose veracity he had every reason to depend, that the said 
money was destined for General Wilkinson, who was in secret correspond 
ence with the Spanish Government. That Mr. Thomas Power, in order to 
conceal the said money, which was, as far as this deponent can recollect, 
a sum of nine thousand dollars, or thereabouts, bought from this deponent 
some barrels of sugar and coffee, in the center of which the said money 
was packed up in small bags which were made for that purpose in this 
deponent's family. That after these preparations were gone through, Mr. 
T. Power set off on his way back to Cincinnati; and that, on said Power's 
return from thence, this deponent was told that the said money had arrived 
safe, and had been delivered to General Wilkinson. And this deponent 
further saith, that shortly after the surrender of Louisiana to the United 
States, a rumor having circulated that General Wilkinson had shipped in 
the vessel in which he returned to the Atlantic States a large quantity of 
sugar, the price of which he had paid him in dollars lately coined, con 
tained in bags not yet unsewed, and such as they are when sent from the 
Spanish mint, this deponent grew suspicious that it was again money paid 
by the Spanish treasury to General Wilkinson, and felt it his duty toward

the fortunes of that tyrant by a comparison with this 
urchin. I continue to take notes of his testimony to his 
own turpitude, which I shall not transcribe here, as they 
may be seen among my papers, by my friends. But it is 
here I shotfld observe, that the address of Wickham, in 
conducting the cross-examination to-day, was masterly 
and ingenious, not only in regard to the witness, but to 
the Administration which so embarrassed Hay, as well as 
the General, that it would be impossible to say which of 
them most heartily welcomed a sudden adjournment, in 



the Government, to whom he had of late sworn allegiance, to inform the 
Governor of this province of the facts to him known concerning the money 
sent up to General Wilkinson in 1796; that Governor Claiborne then re 
quested this deponent to write to the President of the United States on the 
subject; that this deponent wrote accordingly to the President of the 
United States, and delivered his letter into the hands of Gov. Claiborne, 
after having shown him the contents, which he approved of; and that, as 
the said letter was not signed, this deponent, by the advice of Gov. Clai 
borne, mentioned therein to the President that he might know the name 
of the writer from Gov. Claiborne himself, if he should wish it. 

And this deponent further swears, that in the winter of 1804 to 1805, 
this deponent being then at Washington City, in the capacity of a deputy 
from the inhabitants of Louisiana to Congress, jointly with Messrs. Dos- 
trehan and Sawis, he was introduced to Col. Burr, then Vice-President of 
the United States, by General Wilkinson, who strongly recommended to 
this deponent, and, as he believes, to his colleagues, to cultivate the ac 
quaintance of Col. Burr, whom he used to call " the first gentleman in 
America;" telling them that he was a man of the most eminent talents, 
both as a politician and as a military character ; and this deponent further 
swears, that General Wilkinson told him, several times, that Col. Burr, so 
soon as his Vice-Presidency would be at an end, would go to Louisiana, 
where he had certain projects ; adding, that he was such a man as to suc 
ceed in any thing he would undertake, and inviting this deponent to give 
him all the information in his power respecting that country ; which mys 
terious hints appeared to this deponent very extraordinary, though he 
could not then understand them. P. DERBIGENY.

SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS. 433 

wliich Hay hastily sought the only retreat that was left 
to his confusion. The Judge had hardly risen from the 
bench, when a general buzz about Wilkinson's embarrass 
ment ran through the crowd, and in five minutes every 
Democrat in the capitol was expressing his surprise at 
the effect with which we had so suddenly changed our 
characters and turned accusers. I sat this evening an 
hour with Burr. Bollman and Major Smith were the 
only other persons of the party. Here was an oppor 
tunity to confirm my conviction, that neither Burr nor 
Bollman desired I should have any acquaintance with 
the latter, for neither solicited nor proposed an introduc 
tion. Both, no doubt, have discovered, long since, I am 
not of a temper to further their intrigues, but they are 
short-sighted in not perceiving how effectually I can and 
will assuredly frustrate them. Well ! we chatted, never 
theless, on the exclusive topics of our present concerns 
with the Government, among which, it was observed by 
Burr, " that he should not be surprised if the next ^In 
quirer ' attributed his absence from court, at this time, to 
fear of confronting Wilkinson." I remarked, " that such 
misrepresentation could have no effect, as the " Virginia 
Gazette " would contradict it. Burr said, " this last 
paper had no circulation ; " and if $300 could be raised 
immediately, the press of the " Impartial Observer," 
which has been obliged to stop for want of funds, could 
be again set to work. The editor was bold and ingeni 
ous, passed for " a good Democrat, would represent things 
right, and print every thing that was required of him." 
He then asked me, " if I could not raise even $120, with 

which a beginning could be made ? could not I get twenty

subscribers, even to advance $10 each? How sorry he 
was Tupper and Mercer were gone away. They would 
readily contribute. Would not I look about/' etc. I 
said, " I knew not a man that would advance a dollar." 
He seemed surprised that I did not eagerly offer my 
services as a runner to beg for him, and said, " I might 
look out if I pleased; that is," he added, "if I felt any 
interest in the thing." Now, I 'm at a loss to divine the 
drift of this set upon me. Was it to remind me to 
smother any rising thoughts within me, to renew my 
hints to him, of other calls for money? Was it to ex 
hibit me to Bollman in a character he would not appear 
to impose upon him? I own I am at a loss for a solu 
tion. But certainly, however solicitous he may be to 
revive the impartial observer, he was not indifferent to 
making use of this occasion for some other purpose. 
Smith, however, said, "he would look about him ; " and I 
abruptly took leave. Bollman kept silent during the 
mos^ of the visit. He is engaging in his appearance, but 
I have yet had no opportunity to catch any lines of his 
character, which I hope will not hereafter escape me. 
Swartwout is dispatched to Washington on some secret 
mission, which is as mat-apropos, during Wilkinson's ex

which : " The United States palsy to the brain that should plot to dismem

given at a public dinner given to him at Georgetown, 
which, being in or before December, 1805, contradicts 
what he before swore to on that subject. 

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1807. 

The court having been only opened to-day for the pur 
pose of adjourning until to-morrow, to accommodate the 
bar, who are obliged to attend the Court of Chancery, I 
spent an hour with Burr in miscellaneous conversation, 
during which Bob. Robison and Smith were present. 
The arrival in town of Poindexter and Williams, from 
Natchez, being mentioned, and conjectures offered as to 
what Poindexter could say as a witness for the Govern 
ment, Robison observed, " he was inclined to think Col. 
Burr was fortunate in having made his escape when he 
did from that country, as, had he delayed it for another 
day, he would probably have been seized, and have fallen 
into the hands of Wilkinson." Robison seemed unin 
formed altogether of the nature of Meade's stipulations 
with Burr, last January or February, in what was called 
the armistice at Natchez. Burr now entered into a train 
of statements to show Robison how Meade had violated 
his engagements on that occasion. If he had made out 
such a story as he now told in the presence of Smith and 
myself, where we were not by, it might perhaps pass like 
other representations which have, I know not in how 
many instances, been received upon the credit of his 
word. But that he should tell any one, in our hearing, 
that Meade pledged his honor to him that our people 
should all keep their arms, when we know the solicitude

with which he afterward had them all hid, and sunk in 
the river, and say, he was not taken a prisoner, under 
guard, to Washington in the Mississippi Territory, from 
the interview he had, as it was called, ^Yith Meade, at 
Cole's Creek, in pursuance of his forbearing to prefer 
resistance, which he might have made to a surrender of 
his person, it would indeed surpass all credibility, if he 
had not with the same temerity assured Wickham, the 
other day in court, "that the Mississippi militia, while 
ordered out against him, could hardly be kept by him 
from deserting to him by whole companies. What they 
might have been disposed to do, had he shown himself 
worthy of their support, is too far removed from what 
they did to need any attestation from us, or our friends, 
in that country. But young men, whom I can redeem 
from future connections with every incapacity but the 
talents for intrigue, must not be entangled in those snares, 
so imprudently or so rashly laid for their credulity. In 
deed, I am again disposed to call to my aid Cowles 
Meade's impression last winter, that Burr was at times 
deranged, as the only means of accounting for his occa 
sional rashness in his assertions. Certain I am, he ex 
hibited at that season every derangement but that of 
avoidable hazard ; and as his memory is confessedly 
strong, he can not now surely rely upon his facts, without 
a similar, if not a worse, apology. I saw to-day a curious 
parallel of Burr's character and my own, drawn by Wirt, 
in his speech, reported in the " Enquirer," on Wickham's 
motion to arrest the evidence in the treason case. I'll 
transcribe it hereafter. 



POINDEXTER. 437 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1807. 

Wilkinson's cross-examination was continued this 
morning by Wickham, with great ability, and suspend 
ed until to-morrow, to give him time he desired for re 
flection, and further recurrence to his papers, and also to 
enable Burr to finish it to-morrow, as the latter is not 
well enough to attend to-day. Then came forward the 
ingenious Poindexter, who delivered a very petulant and 
dogmatical testimony, in the course of which he had the 
effrontery to state the whole affair of the alleged recog 
nizance of Burr taken by old Rodney, in a manner to in 
duce, if he could, a belief that Rodney was perfectly cor 
rect; that Burr had forfeited an original recognizance, 
and that Rodney was one of the best men living; while 
no honest man in the Territory believed a word of the 
stories that were told there of another recognizance or 
memorandum for one having been suppressed ; he even 
went so far as to say, he heard, and believed, that Hard 
ing had begun to write an original, but got tired before 
he finished it, and it was thrown under the table. ! 
Harding, my estimable friend, may you soon be able to 
scourge this paltry pettifogger, who further declared, on 
his oath, that the matter was now before the Supreme 
Court of the Territory, where the securities would get 
off, not upon the merits of the case, but because the 
Judge who bound them had not cognizance of the offense. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1807. 

Burr attended to-day in court, and concluded the cross- 
examination of Wilkinson ; after which, Poindexter was 



438 THE BLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

again called for, and was, if possible, a greater curiosity 
as a witness than he had been yesterday. His parade of 
his opinion of the jurisdiction of the courts in the Mis 
sissippi Territory, his strictures on the presentments hy 
Burr's grand jury there, his justification of his conduct 
as honorary aid-de-camp and Attorney General, and his 
insolence to Burr and his counsel, all exhibited him in a 
light which introduced a character into the piece now 
performing at the capitol, as novel as it was unexpected. 
Then succeeded a witness of a very opposite cast, a Mr. 
Trisley, one of the late grand jury here, who has riveted 
on Wilkinson's character and credit those fetters Jeffer 
son and himself were so long forging together for the 
fame and liberty of others. After a close struggle be 
tween opposite counsel, Wickham succeeded by his usual 
address in wresting from the prosecutors a very curious 
letter by Jefferson to Wilkinson, of the 3d of last Janu 
ary, which I must, if possible, get a copy of. Martin 
was both- yesterday and to-day more in his cups than 
usual, and though he spared neither his prudence nor his 
feelings, he was happy in all his hits. 11 o'clock, P. M. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1807. 

Wilkinson, though it was thought by many yesterday 
that his cross-examination was concluded, was, this morn 
ing, again further interrogated as to the import of his 
instructions to Lieutenant Pike, and the nature of his 
confidential intercourse with Kibby. But nothing could 
be got out of him as to the former; and, as to any deal 
ing with Kibby, of the sort alluded to in Kibby's pub 
lished affidavit, he would no more confess it than that he 



CHALLENGE. 439 

is said, by the records of scandal, to have had in his youth 
with General G * * * . He produced two copies of 
alleged instructions to Pike. These papers, being of his 
own manufacture, left his adversaries, of course, to con 
tent themselves with whatever effect the suspicions aris 
ing from their questions might produce in the minds of 
the auditors, if not of the Judge. But the publication in 
the " Argus," to-day, of no less than six documents, of 
fered by Wilkinson in the course of his examination, and 
rejected by the Judge as improper to be given in evidence, 
will operate a preponderating counterpoise in his favor. 
Before he withdrew, he appealed to the Court on the 
attempts that had been made, during his examination, 
upon his honor and veracity ; observing, " that it now 
would be easy for him to show his whole conduct in its 
true light, freed from all manner of doubt or suspicion 
of his motives, if Burr would produce the letter of the 
13th of May, alluded to in the ciphered letter, which 
would enable him to expose other letters from Burr 
which occasioned that letter." He then declared that 
Burr's assertion, " that the letter of the 13th of May had 
been put out of Burr's power into the hands of a third 
person, with Wilkinson's knowledge," was unfounded, 
and destitute of all manner of truth ; that Burr knew 
the very reverse was the fact ; and with warmth and as 
perity of language, he again challenged him to produce it. 
Burr, with an air of dignity and composure which, I think, 
he borrowed from an opinion that he is not bound to give 
Wilkinson a meeting out of court, demanded whether this 
sort of language and such topics were giving testimony ; 



440 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and then observed, " that the General was there to tell 
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, upon his 
oath, and should reserve other matters for another place." 
Wilkinson now withdrew ; but who can not perceive that, 
in this scene, the craft of the advocate shrunk from the 
charge of his enemy. I examined, soon after this, Gates 
and Jones the latter of whom fully proved the terms of 
a parole agreement to go down the river with me last 
winter in a manner to defeat every effect the testimony 
of the Hendersons could possibly produce to my preju 
dice. I find Burr has a heavy bill against the United 
States, on account of advances he says he has made to 
agents employed for summoning his witnesses. How 
many have undertaken this service for him J[ know not; 
some I do know who advanced their own money, in ex 
pectation of being refunded by Burr or the United States. 
But how far Burr will be indemnified for his advances in 
this business may be guessed from the transaction already 
narrated of the manreuvre, by which he put Ellis, one of 
his creditors, in cash. (See conclusion to notes of 23d of 
August.) But Ellis, who was to-day examined, parried 
some lounges made at him, during his examination on 
this subject, by saying, "it was a verbal summons he got 
at Natchez the proper one was served upon him here." 
I will now set down here Wirt's parallel of Burr's char 
acter and my own. After having stated that Burr was 
manoeuvring to effect his escape from the prosecutions, by 
having me sacrificed in his stead, he asks, " By what sort 
of legerdemain is it, that Burr wants to shuffle himself 
down to the bottom of the pack, and turn me up, princi-

pal traitor ? "# He then proceeds as follows : " Who, then, 
is Aaron Burr and what the part which he has borne in 
this transaction ? " 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1807. 

I called on Burr this morning, when he, at last, men 
tioned to me, during a short tete a tete, that he was 
preparing to go to England ; that the time was now aus 
picious for him ; and he wished to know whether I could 
give him letters. I answered, " that I supposed when he 
said England, he meant London, as his business would 
probably be with people in office ; that I knew none of 

:;: Will any man say that Blennerhassett was the principal, and Burr 
but an accessory? Who will believe that Burr, the author and projector 
of the plot, who raised the forces, who enlisted the men, and who procured 
the funds for carrying it into execution, was made a cat's-paw of? Will 
any man believe that Burr, who is a soldier, bold, ardent, restless, and 
aspiring, the great actor whose brain conceived, and whose hand brought, 
the plot into operation, that he should sink down into an accessory, and 
that Blennerhassett should be elevated into a principal? He would startle 
at once at the thought. Aaron Burr, the contriver of the whole conspiracy, 
to every body concerned in it, was as the sun to the planets which sur 
round him. Did he not bind them in their respective orbits, and give 
them their light, their heat, and their motion? Yet he is to be con 
sidered an accessory, and Blennerhassett is to be the principal, who, 
thus deluded from his interest and his happiness, thus seduced from 
the paths of innocence and peace, thus confounded in the toils that were 
deliberately spread for him, and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit 
and genius of another this man, thus ruined and undone, and made to 
play a subordinate part in this grand drama of guilt and treason, this man 
is to be called the principal offender; while he, by whom he was thus 
plunged in misery, is comparatively innocent, a mere accessory ! Is this 
reason? Is it law? Is it humanity? Sir, neither the human heart nor 
the human understanding will bear a perversion so monstrous and absurd ! 
so shocking to the soul ! so revolting to reason ! Let Aaron Burr, then, 
not shrink from the high destination which he has courted ; and having 
already ruined Blennerhassett in fortune, character, and happiness for 
ever, let him not attempt to finish the tragedy by thrusting that ill-fated 
man between himself and punishment. Extract from W. Wirts Speech.

the present ministry, nor did I believe I had a single 
acquaintance in London." He replied, " he meant to 
visit every part of the country, and would be glad to get 
letters to any one." I said, that I would think of it ; that 
I might discover whether I had any friends there, whom 
it would be an object worth his attention to know, and 
took leave. Thus it is, this strange man continues to 
expose his inconsistency with himself, rather than lay 
aside the mysterious mask, with which he has ever 
sought, and still continues, to disguise his very hints a 
practice, I believe, he has not departed from in any 
instance, from "Wilkinson down to myself. We can only 
conjecture, therefore, his designs. For my part, I am 
disposed to suspect he has no serious purpose of reviving 
any of his speculations in America, or even of returning 
from Europe, if he can get there. His anxiety to elude 
his creditors is, I believe, occupation enough for his 
energies, which are little, except in his reveries. Out of 
them he tells different stories to different persons, enjoin 
ing confidence from all, but committing himself in noth 
ing to any one. I have suspected for some time, however, 
he really does dream of appearing in London, with some 
thing, according to his ideas, in the nature of a suite. 
Some weeks past, he consulted De Pestre, to learn from 
him how much money would be wanted to enable him to 
go and return. He said, he supposed that $10,000 might 
answer. De Pestre told him, that would depend on the 
nature of his business, and the time it would require to 
transact it. But he has more lately been engaged in en 
deavoring to attach to him some young men who may 
accompany him. I yet only know, positively, two. Sam. 



FRIENDLY INTERPOSITION. 443 

Swartwout was enraptured with the prospect, and still 
may feast his imagination upon it ; though I could not 
resist the propensity I felt to convey to this fine young 
man, without his suspecting from whence it came, a curb, 
which may restrain his generous ardor and innocent 
credulity. His relation, Major Smith, has endeavored to 
apply it. Bob. Robison was the other, and, to save him, 
my breast heaved with indignation against his tempter, 
while my heart labored for the danger of my young 
friend, when I found that his property was Mr. Burr's 
object; for Burr, it seems, in the first place, certified 
himself by inquiries of Major Smith, that Robison's 
father was wealthy, and Robert an only child, before he 
proposed the voyage to him, which I find he had the 
insolence to introduce by telling him, Smith, Robison 
would be much pleased to accompany him, as Mr. Blen- 
nerhassett had assured him, than which nothing is more 
false. But Burr is as careless of his facts as of his 
religion, where neither is exposed to scrutiny ; and any 
liberty with them may advance his purpose for the mo 
ment. I had seasonably prepared this young man, who 
will to-morrow make his escape to Pittsburgh, from the 
fascinations of this serpent. I was much entertained for 
two or three hours by the performance on the piano by a 
young Frenchman, who is a fine performer, and made me 
acquainted with some new music of Haydn and others, 
which he executed with masterly skill and expression. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1807. 

This day was chiefly consumed with hearing testimony 
adduced to prove Eaton's incompetency or discredit ; 



444 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

which failed, according to the legal rules of evidence, 
though Eaton himself has already fully anticipated the 
object of his adversaries. I am very unhappy in failing 
to hear from ISTatchez, to relieve my anxiety for Harnian. 
But why should I presume to pray for the removal of my 
trouble for him and his mother, when I know how un 
worthy I have been of the many blessings I have already 
enjoyed in them. I have ever thought too highly of 
Dominick, in prejudice to his brother ; my late cares for 
the latter have equalized the account. 

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1807. 

Burr and Martin made a considerable blunder to-day, 
by producing a Major Brough, to the discredit of Wil 
kinson, as they thought. The Major, it is true, told some 
curious stories to the Court and to the General, as unex 
pected by the Judge, probably, as they were unpalatable 
to the Brigadier ; but the effect only tended to show both 
equally rivals in treachery to the State, if not to them 
selves. Burr would gladly have pretermitted the exhi 
bition of this scene, but it was too late ; the curtain had 
risen, and "Peacham" and "Locket" stood confessed in 
every line of their characters, except a compromise of 
their differences. But as, in such cases, " honest men 
come by their own," the public feelings on the Mississippi 
will necessarily be relieved, by the disclosures of this wit 
ness, from the insult and mortification of again seeing 
Wilkinson command in that country. It is in vain that 
Wilkinson has promised to destroy the credit of this wit 
ness. The Major has brandished his sword with such 
effect and address, on this occasion, that he has not only

cut down the General, but even disarmed his auxiliaries 
Jefferson, Dearborn and Rodney who have so long 
fought by his side throughout, this criminal warfare. In 
short, unless this testimony, which, from its effect upon 
Jefferson, etc., I regard as the most interesting that has 
occurred, can be totally obliterated from the reports of 
the present motley proceedings at the capitol, and the 
Major be absolutely foxed, the execration of the admin 
istration will soon be sown on the Mississippi, to produce 
a crop similar to that which sprung from the teeth of the 
hydra. I regret the whole narrative will not probably 
appear in full before Robertson's report of the whole 
proceedings. This evening, my friend Hendren, who has 
again come up to town chiefly to see me, has called to 
express his satisfaction at the near prospect of my restora 
tion to my family, .and to solicit my acceptance of a 
horse he has a long time destined for me, together with 
whatever money I may have occasion for. He has duly 
tempered the frankness of these propositions with senti 
ments of corresponding delicacy. I, alas ! have made no 
better return to this generosity than words that lightened 
not the burden that he had laid upon my heart, which, I 
hope, God will give it strength to carry to my grave. 
How long have I sought, through life, friends without my 
family; and where have I found any, until the hand of 
Divine mercy pointed their regards to that piety that has 
supported the patience of my distress. I have declined 
Hendren's favors, and quieted his solicitude to serve 
me, by requesting him to look out for a few negroes 
I want to purchase. He will see me again next Monday.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1807. 

Wilkinson was not ready to-day to undertake his attack 
upon the credit of Major Brough, but he will attempt it 
to-morrow. Nothing was done, of any consequence, in 
court to-day. Soon after it adjourned, I took a letter for 
my wife to the " Eagle," to go by Col. McKee, who leaves 
for Natchez to-morrow. I had there the happiness to see 
Doctor Commins, just arrived. He made me happy, by 
assuring me my boys were running about on the 25th of 
August, when he last saw them, and has brought me a 
packet, which I shall receive in the morning. I find I 
have omitted to note a very curious discovery made in 
court last Saturday. Nothing less than letters of McKee's, 
some of thenT dated in January and February last, pro 
duced by Wilkinson, proving the Col. to have been with 
us on the Mississippi, far more as a spy than a friend. 
The capillaries of the Colonel's physiognomy, during the 
reading of the said letters, were swollen to bursting. The 
man, I believe, would have hissed upon immersion in 
cold water. He was struck dumb, and, upon his release, 
went off in a tangent. Burr can't endure a hint of this 
incident; and yet he has since been more than once 
closeted with the Colonel. Can he find no better friends, 
or is he really deranged ? 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1807. 

Wilkinson has not kept his promise of to-day, dis 
crediting the testimony of Major Brough. An unim 
portant witness or two were examined by way of killing 
time, which now seems to be the favorite object of the 



EXCITEMENT. 447 

prosecutors. Afterward, Hay at last announced that the 
evidence was closed on the part of the prosecution, but 
reserved his right to examine, without restriction, all of 
those witnesses that may arrive, according to his fancy, 
which was conceded to him. He then entered upon his 
speech, to comment on the evidence, which appeared to 
me the best effort I have yet heard from him ; it was per 
spicuous and somewhat ingenious. I have therefore 
taken pretty close notes of all such parts of it as appeared 
to me to be worthy of notice, or particularly applicable to 
myself. He spoke, however, to empty benches until the 
rising of the Court, which was, for his accommodation, 
protracted half an hour longer than usual. A few 
minutes before he stopped, I was much diverted by a 
display of his irritability, which was excited by McRae's 
interrupting him with a whisper to stop at 4 o'clock. 
Upon this, the attorney fired with indignation, and in 
his wrath very plainly exhibited his contempt for his co 
adjutor, by telling him he would not be interrupted by 
him ; and then endeavoring fruitlessly to compose his ire, 
he lamented the condition of counsel, that could neither 
agree with those on their own side, or those who were 
opposed to them. I sent to Doctor Commins, this morn 
ing, for the packet he brought me from Natchez, but not 
having received it, I called upon him this evening, 
when he delivered it to me in a wretched state, it hav 
ing been taken from him in the Creek Nation of In 
dians, by Col. Hawkins, the agent of that tribe, who, 
after examining my letter-bag, and every original letter 
my wife had sent me, except perhaps two sealed letters 
from herself, and, after taking such extracts and copies 



448 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

of the whole as he chose, then returned to Doctor Com- 
mins as many as he thought proper. This outrage I 
shall have formally stated in an affidavit by the Doctor, 
in order to procure an attachment against the Colonel. I 
spent a very pleasant evening at the Musical Society, 
where I met Mrs. Chevalier and Mrs. "Wickham. They 
seemed pleased with some performances, in which I took 
a part, particularly a quartette of Pleyel's. Mrs. Chev 
alier gave me some hospitable reproaches for the scarcity 
of my visits. I believe her husband a most generous and 
benevolent man, which his countenance fully bespeaks. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1807. 

It is a little singular that my birthday should yesterday 
have passed by without my having noticed it ; but this 
has been the case for several of the last years of my life, 
and T suppose the reason is, that my mind is hardly occu 
pied once a year in thinking of myself. I may have 
taken my height and weight, perhaps full twenty times in 
the course of my life ; but I am certain I never remem 
bered, much less noted, the amount of either, so that I 
could recollect it one hour after trial. Yesterday, then, I 
completed my forty-second or forty-third year; for my 
father and mother could never agree whether I was born 
in 1764 or 1765, though they coincided as to the day, fix 
ing it on the 8th of October. But at such a distance from 
my suffering family, I can not estimate how much hap 
piness or misery they have been preparing for my future 
years. Hay finished his speech to-day. He was followed 
by Randolph, in a style that will read much better than 
it was delivered. He relied chiefly on the effect of Burr's 







RAISING MONEY. 449 

acquittal, and arguments drawn from the Constitution. 
As to me, he seemed to forget my case altogether, save 
so far as his concern for Burr obliged him to mention my 
name and writings. This, I suspect, will also be the case 
with Wickham. Nous verrons. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1807. 

The Court does not sit to-day, at the request of the 
prosecutors ; yet they are eternally complaining of the 
tedious length of the trial, and their own confinement 
and sufferings by it. The accused have no sufferings, it 
seems, worthy of their notice. I have to-day spent much 
time in painful reflections on the state of my affairs with 
Burr. It appears by a statement of my private account 
with him, so far as I can now collect all my charges 
against him here, for he has but two credits, he is in 
debted to me in a balance of $2,864.96, independent of 
my account against him, for what I have already paid 
and lost, by my indorsement of the bill held by Miller for 
$4,000. It will be useless, or worse, for me to attempt to 
appear at Marietta without a sum of money, if not suffi 
cient to discharge Miller's claim, at least necessary to 
enable me to get my negroes away from Ohio, if that is 
now possible, and to redeem some few valuable articles 
of my property that have been sacrificed at sheriff's 
sales. I have therefore imagined a method of forcing 
Burr's exertions to raise money for me, which is the most 
likely to succeed. It is founded on the principle of 
effecting through his vanity and interest what it is now 
evident I should in vain seek through his justice or 

generosity. I will hint to him my ability to introduce 
29 



450 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

him into the first circles in England, by introductory 
letters ; at the same time, showing him my expectations 
of becoming soon possessed of a large fortune in Europe, 
from which, I doubt not, I shall be enabled to engage his 
best endeavors, if not his warmest interest. This plan 
I shall put in execution to-morrow, of which I will note 
the effect upon him. Leaving it to ripen in his medita 
tions for a week, I shall then open my present distresses to 
him in detail, and present him with his account. It is 
a little painful, I own, to feel oneself obliged to bring 
even a bad man into the path of his duty by artifice. 
But the details of the manoeuvre, when examined, will, I 
trust, do me no discredit with my friends. 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1807. 

It being very warm and dusty this morning, I sent to 
John Banks for a horse to visit his family and Chevalier's, 
they living two miles apart, and take the benefit of a 
short ride. But I previously called upon Burr, whom I 
found alone and in good spirits. He attributed the re 
moval of his indisposition exclusively to the effect of my 
pills, and his inflamed eye was nearly cured. Daniel 
Clark and Mr. Powers had arrived from Orleans to sup 
port the depositions of Derbigeny and the younger Mer- 
cier, to the confirmation of Wilkinson's character and 
ruin. Availing myself of such a state of things, I en 
tered into desultory conversation affecting all freedom of 
thought from any particular object. The affair of the 
Leopard and Chesapeake being mentioned, Burr observed, 
that though the difference between the United States and 
Great Britain on that account might be expected to be 



"FRIENDS AT COURT." 451 

soon settled, there were many other causes of dispute 
which would not soon be removed ; that this was a most 
auspicious moment for his purposes to visit England, and 
he had no doubt he could, in serving himself and his 
friends there, show them, the ministry, their best interests 
in a manner that would convince their judgment. This 
was the best opportunity I could have desired for my pur 
pose. I now told him, as he happened to be alone, I had 
been reflecting on the application he had lately made to 
me for letters to England, to assist the better means he 
no doubt possessed of establishing his intercourse with 
the best society in that country. I regretted that, through 
the fluctuations of parties there, I had no acquaintance 
with any member of the Administration. But I had 
thought of three noblemen, with whom I had been at 
school at Westminster, and there intimate with them all, 
though I had never since met with any of them, except 
Lord Sackville, who had visited me in Ireland. To Lord 
S., therefore, I could write, and also to Lords Elgin and 
Courtenay. The latter I was very intimate with at 
school ; and the former, I presumed, from the circum 
stance of his having been not long since ambassador at 
the courts of Petersburgh and Constantinople, must be 
much respected by the present ministers, if not in office 
with them. To all these personages, I said, I thought I 
could properly address a mere letter of introduction, 
which if it would not of itself produce the end proposed, 
would not fail to do so when supported by the appear 
ance he would make in London, the address with which 
he would be as impressive there as here, and the distin 
guished rank he lately occupied in the American Govern- 



452 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ment. The effect of this communication was rapture. 
The whole man was changed. With all his studied re 
serve, he could not restrain his transports, which agitated 
his countenance and his movements far more than the 
news of a capital prize in the lottery could have done. I 
now, after pausing a little, to give his reflections time to 
recover his usual composure, asked if he remembered a 
hint I had sometime since given him, that I entertained 
some expectations of hereafter becoming easy in my cir 
cumstances, and perhaps wealthy. " Yes," he hastily 
replied, " very well.' 7 I then alluded to a communication 
by letter from a friend in Ireland, which I would now 
acquaint him with, and from which I might expect, if my 
prospects should be realized, possibly to meet him in 
those circles in Europe, into which I proposed to intro 
duce him ; now drawing from my pocket A. Martin's 
letter of 16th of last May, which luckily contained no 
other matter than that I wished him to see, and some 
political news. I presented it to him. He read it delib 
erately, over and over, and I now beheld myself estab 
lished in an influence upon his feelings, and a considera 
tion from his notice, to which I am persuaded I had 
never before possessed the least title. Hey-day ! behold 
the wretched and beggared Blennerhassett about to rise 
out of the misery in which I have plunged him, and his 
unhappy family, into wealth and consequence. The heir, 
too, of a nobleman ! His new wealth and his dignified 
connections must supply me with better materials for my 
projected speculations than all others I have hitherto col 
lected. His connections and his purse shall lay the foun 
dation under which I will again bury his credulity and 



453 

rear upon it my aggrandizement. I am persuaded all 
this, and probably much more to the same purpose, en 
tered and pervaded the mind of this arch-financier, with 
the velocity of light, in an instant. Be it so. Let him 
outwit himself. He shall have my letters to the British 
nobleman, and may make his own use of them, If he 
will first exonerate me from Miller's demand, and pay 
or secure the balance he owes me before we part. Other 
wise, we break upon a ivrit, and for every thing else, I 
fear not his address in future. 

Chevalier, as usual, pressed me to dinner. I have such 
full confidence in his goodness that I believe I shall ven 
ture to request him to indorse or negotiate a bill on Phil 
adelphia for me. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1807. 

I am miserable this morning, by being denied a letter 
from Natchez. The season advances, and witnesses con 
tinue to arrive so constantly, that I am filled with appre 
hensions of being unable to descend the Ohio before the 
breaking up of that river. Martin commenced his speech 
on the evidence this morning, and only reached the first 
full stop at the hour of adjournment. He will probably 
hold out full two days more. 

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1807. 

Martin kept on his feet again to-day until the adjourn 
ment. He has only come to the second period. I had 
this morning an extremely friendly note from Chevalier, 
telling me he never lends his name to any body, but has 
one thousand dollars at my command, which I have ac- 



454 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

cepted, to send to the sale by Commins. I have spent a 
pleasant evening at Banks', where I often take Smith 
with me, as he knows no one here. Banks has given me 

some lines he made on the late Miss , which I will 

here transcribe, as they deserve preservation : 

SWEET SHADE. 

Within our hearts, thy mem'ry is embalmed 
Beyond the usual gifts that grace thy sex; 
Thy various virtues and acquirements shone: 
The dignity of worth (like thine) it would 
Degrade to blazon each peculiar claim 
That marked thy value here ; for all who knew 
Thee felt its force, and every tongue seemed 
Emulous to praise. The young, enraptured, 
Hung upon thy name; with equal rev'rence 
And grateful love hailed the bright exemplar 
That adorned the sex. Pleased with the theme, 
The aged matron, too, for this laid by 
The frigid caution of maturer years ; 
With joy exulting, joined the general praise, 
And wished, a pious wish, her offspring might 
Through life's alluring scenes tread the chaste paths 
That marked Eliza's steps. 

One kindred trait, that marked thy latest hour, 
Unknown to all but to thy weeping friends, 
Who clung around the sable couch of Death, 
'T were impious not to note. The God who smote 
Still blessed thee to the last. Its powers thy mind 
Retained ; while, conscious of th' approaching call, 
Thy steadfast soul still stood serene and firm. 
No tumult there, no dread, no terror could 
Disturb the heart which purity inspired. 
'T was Resignation's calm I Thy closing eyes, 
'T is true, a transient tremor felt, and o'er 
The fevered cheek a drop let fall. 0! 't was 



MARTIN AND MVRAE. 455 

A sacred gem, incalculably rich ! 
A legacy divine ; for others' woes 
It fell. 'T was filial sympathy, which, like 
A shock electric, struck the palsied nerve, 
Impervious but to this. Dim though thy sight, 
Yet still thou sawest a parent's 
Agonizing pangs ; a precious pearl 
Thou gav'st ; and with the boon expir'd. 
Sweet Shade ! this tribute is not half thy due. 
Alas ! too soon we pay the solemn meed ; 
Yet bear it on thy wing; 't will pleasing prove 
A passport to the skies ; and when, blest Shade, 
Thy sister-spirits, who thy flight await 
At Heav'n's portal, shall peruse the scroll, 
In strains celestial, not unknown to thee, 
They '11 chant the theme divine, until it reach 
The Throne of Grace. There, in regal state, 
The King of Kings, in all the majesty 
Of Heaven arrayed, with sweet solacing smile, 
Shall hail thy welcome to the realms above, 
While myriads of the just around him sing : 
"This the reward of virtuous acts below, 
Eternal life and bliss for evermore 1 " 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1807. 

Martin at last concluded at 4 o'clock, with the adjourn 
ment this evening. Want of arrangement, verbosity, and 
eternal repetitions, have more than sated the malice of 
his enemies. 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15. 1807. 

MoRae consumed this whole day with somewhat less 
discredit to himself than might have been expected. It 
appears that he is now the only one of the three prose 
cuting counsel that labors to bolster up the credit and

consistency of Wilkinson. Hay has declared, out of 
court, " he has washed his hands of him." I had a 
friendly letter from Devereux, announcing his being 
about to return to Ireland, where he expects to recover 
his estate, and. assuring me, with much concern for my 
present sufferings, his actions shall prove his friendship, 
whenever his means can give it that operation he now so 
generously laments he can not direct to my succor. He 
assures me, however, Pierce Butler, Esq., of Philadelphia, 
has directed him, without solicitation, to invite me to call 
upon him for any pecuniary aid I may need. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1807. 

Wickham followed Martin, instead of McRae, yester 
day, and was, I think, far below his former efforts. He 
occupied the day nearly. It was to-day McRae exhib 
ited, as I have just mentioned, not having had time to 
write down yesterday's notes till this evening. 

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1807. 

Wirt spoke very much to engage the fancy of his hear 
ers, to-day, without affecting their understanding; for he 
can not reason upon the facts before him, and can no more 
conduct a law argument than I could raise a mountain. 
As Junius says of the king, " The feather that adorns 
him supports his flight." " Strip him of his plumage 
and you fix him to the earth." He attempted to be sar 
castic on all his opponents. Randolph he charged with 
a decay of professional and oratorical powers, which keep 
pace with the march of his years. Martin he upbraided 
with ill earned and unmerited fame, which had disap- 



VISITING. 457 

pointed the expectations of the Virginia bar, before which 
he had shone through so many moons, but had never yet 
appeared in any of the phases of the law. I mention this, 
as a specimen of his efforts in the figurative style, to show 
how unhappy he is in his researches into those mines of 
taste and study which the fancy of an orator never ex^ 
plores in vain. Wickham he boldly accused of unadorned 
plagiarism, in appropriating to himself the arguments of 
Dallas and Lewis in the case of Fries, and even express 
ing their ideas with inferior eloquence. I took some notes 
of this orator's performance, which Wickham was very 
glad to get, as he was absent during the delivery of what 
w^as so pointedly applied to himself. " O that mine enemy 
would write a book ! " Wilkinson is writing one, which, 
some say, is to ruin not only Burr, but Jefferson too. 

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1807. 

I staid at home until evening, owing to the high wind 
and dust that annoyed every one who ventured abroad. 
But I drank tea, and spent the evening until 10 o'clock, 
at Mrs. Chevalier's. I there met Mrs. David Randolph, 
who is a middle-aged lady, and very accomplished; of 
charming manners, and possessing a masculine mind, 
From this lady, the near relation of the President, and 
whose brother is married to his daughter, I heard more 
pungent strictures upon Jefferson's head and heart, be 
cause they were better founded than any I had ever heard 
before, and she certainly uttered more treason than my 
wife ever dreamed of; for she ridiculed the experiment 
of a Republic in this country, which the vices and incon 
stancy of parties and the people had too long shown to 



458 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

be nothing more than annual series of essays to complete 
a work ill begun, and which appeared to be nearly worn 
out before it was half finished. But " she always was 
disgusted with the fairest ideas of a modern Republic, 
however she might respect those of antiquity." And as 
for the treason, " she cordially hoped, whenever Burr, or 
any one else, again attempted to do any thing, the Atlan 
tic States would be comprised in the plan." She talked 
much of Thomas Moore, with whom she was highly 
pleased here, and recited some favorite extracts from 
him ; but she is very much mortified by the indiscrimi 
nate censure of Virginia, with which he has requited the 
hospitality and consideration with which he was uni 
versally treated in this State his only two exceptions 
from his strictures being Wickham and the Chief Justice ; 
but in the former he could discover no accomplishment, 
beyond professional skill and a slight knowledge of 
French, with a talent for repartee, and an imagination 
denied all favors which it would in vain solicit from 
nature and the sciences. Of the Chief Justice, I can not 
speak, out of the precincts of the law, or his politics, 
which I already begin to fear will exhibit his heart, as 
unlike those of Hardwick or Cambden, as his mind may 
resemble theirs." I also obtained from this interesting 
lady some sketches of the characters of General Dayton 
and Bollman, with both of whom her acute penetration 
seems to have had sufiicient opportunities of informing 
her judgment. The sentence of my moral craniology on 
these heads thus presented to me was this, that the one 
is that of an unprincipled speculator and crafty politician, 
who never appeals to his reason but to deceive, and never 



A CHALLENGE. 459 

departs from it but to be sensual. The other is that of 
an individual possessing similar talents, more highly re 
fined by nature, but less consolidated by experience, with 
syren faculties of speech and manner, never exerted to 
captivate, but to destroy their victim, and a temperament 
of antipathy, rather than of inclination to the sex. I, 
this morning, closed long letters to A. Martin, for Ireland, 
after, I believe, full two months' neglect. I have so long 
been dosed with the incessant vexations of my prosecu 
tion, that I sometimes imagine my apathy is better lent 
me to befit me for the future frowns of unsteady fortune, 
than to prepare me for the insidious smiles. I am already 
her puppet. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1807. 

Wirt concluded with perhaps a better two hours' dis 
play of his powers than he has yet exhibited. Lieutenant 
Jackson, at last, made his appearance, but fell very short 
of what the prosecutors expected of him, from the pur 
port of his affidavits, which they have published in the 
" Argus," and of his own infamy : though he made out 
enough of treachery and perjury, probably, to swell the 
current of suspicion against Burr's treasonable designs. 
Swartwout* has sent "Wilkinson a challenge, but with 
out effect. 



* Swartwout sent a challenge to General Wilkinson by Israel Smith, 
which he (W.) refused to read, saying that "he held no correspondence 
with traitors or conspirators." This raised Swartwout's ire, and induced 
him to publish the following in the " Virginia Gazette:" 
To His EXCELLENCY BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAMES WILKINSON. 

SIR : When once the chain of infamy grapples to a knave, every new 
link creates a fresh sensation of detestation and horror. As it gradually

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1807. 

I have said nothing of my relief, yesterday, by a letter 
from my beloved, bearing the intelligence of her recovery 
from a fever. Who would think I was glad to receive 
this letter ! I had been miserable for three weeks in ap 
prehension for Harman. This new calamity has affected 
me with a kind of lethargy, from which I awake often in 
surprise, to wonder that we are all four alive, as if life, 
upon any terms, was unnatural in our present prospects. 
0, Melancholy ! how long wilt thou brood upon me. I 
have begun a letter to my wife. Sustain her strength, O 
God, who approvest her virtue, and can best assuage her 
sufferings. Mr. Marshall, at length, has delivered an 



or precipitately unfolds itself, we behold in each succeeding connection, 
and arising from the same corrupt and contaminated source, the same base 
and degenerate conduct. I could not have supposed that you would have 
completed the catalogue of your crimes by adding to the guilt of treachery, 
forgery and perjury, the accomplishment of cowardice. But every succeed 
ing day presents you in a new light to the public, and plunges you still 
deeper in crime and ignominy. Having failed in two different attempts to 
procure an interview with you, such as no gentleman of honor could refuse, 
I have only to pronounce and publish you to the world as a coward and 
poltroon. One word more before I take my leave. This is a critical moment 
in the life of your Excellency. Your reputation is gone for ever, and your 
life totters on the verge of dissolution. As you can not pretend to the es 
teem of any man living, you should have sought a momentary reputation 
in the applause of even your enemies. You should have been brave, and died 
like a man. Your enemies would then have forgotten the wrongs you had 
done them. Your country would have been appeased, and even Judas for 
given. You should have considered that there is some small merit in even 
a villain's bravery ; it was all you were supposed to possess this side of 
the grave. You should have made much of it; it might have served to 
wipe away some portion of the stain which your treachery and turpitude 
have fixed upon your character. S. SWARTWOUT.

LONGINGS. 461 

elaborate opinion, purporting that he can not commit any 
of us for treason ; not because we had none in our hearts, 
but because we did none with our hands. But the last 
article has determined him to commit me for trial, to 
Ohio, for a misdemeanor. Burr is, of course, ordered on 
this new dance. I shall, however, I fancy, leave the little 
emperor to exhibit in it alone ; for it is now time I 
should withdraw behind the scenes, even though I should 
employ .Duane to shift them. I shall therefore set out to 
Philadelphia, first for this object, and next to close my 
pecuniary affairs with Burr there, which I could not do 
here. I have given bail for my appearance at Chil- 
licothe, the 4th of January ; bondsmen, Smith and 
Commins. 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1807. 

Burr is in a sort of keeping at his own house, en 
deavoring to get all his bail renewed in the civil suits 
here depending against him. Martin has become his 
security, I believe, to the amount of $15,000. How much 
of this he may eventually sink in the purchase of the 
old staple of experience, he will ascertain in about six 
months. 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1807. 

Wrote to my wife a letter to go by Ashley, which I 
will not close until the moment before I leave this town. 
It will reach her, and, I trust, tend to support her until I 
can escape, and then into Florida with her, if necessary, 
which I am determined to attempt, rather than play a 
part in a second trial, which would separate me from my 
family, probably, for not less than a year from hence. 



462 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Was I criminal in seeking some little refuge from my 
trouble this evening at the Musical Society ? I met there 
Mesdames Wickham, Chevalier and the Misses M. I 
only took a part in one quartette, by particular desire of 
those ladies. Midnight. 

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1807. 

Breakfasted at Mrs. Chevalier's, where I met a pleasant 
party. At ten o'clock I rode out to visit Banks, and pre 
scribe for an indisposition with which he is affected. 
Smith, being finally discharged by the Chief Justice, left 
me yesterday for New York. I am endeavoring to ob 
tain a lot of negroes, in partnership with Dr. Commins, 
though I fear we shall not succeed. This evening visited 
Wickham, to fee him with a few words. He thinks, in 
case Government should be disposed to desire my convic 
tion at Chillicothe, Woodbridge's evidence will enable 
them easily to affect it. Revisited and spent the evening 
with Banks. He has offered to lend me one hundred 
dollars, which I shall probably accept, to enable me to 
return Chevalier's money. I take a horse and gig from 
Banks, as there is no conveyance from hence, in any pub 
lic or private carriage, for ten .days to come. Burr, Mar 
tin, Commins, and myself, with two servants, will proba 
bly form a cavalcade to move to-morrow or next day. I 
must raise money in Philadelphia, on chances, and even 
strain a point with Commius, there to aid me whatever 
success I may have with Burr.

with these notes, before now, 11, P. M. I am just re 
turned from a two-mile walk in the dark, to take leave 
of the family of my friend, John Banks, who has kindly 
pressed me to borrow the largest sum, I believe, he could 
spare. And before I lie down to take two hours' rest, 
before I am called up to set off in the stage for the Fede 
ral city, I must note my having closed a letter I began 
several days ago to my wife, to go by Ashley, who will 
commence his journey to-morrow or the next day. My 
excellent friend Jos. Lewis, I find by letter from him this 
evening, has removed my fears for my credit and honor, 
by remitting to Mr. Chevalier 1,000, to replace that sum 
lately lent me by Mr. C. The house it seems, in Phila 
delphia, must still suspend my credit, on account of the 
removal of Sander's attachment. But J. L. will lend his 
generous friendship to succor that honor of a friend in 
distress, who is not, I trust, unworthy of the sympathies 
of his liberal heart. His counsel will soon direct my dis 
tracted cares to peace. 

WASHINGTON CITY, TUESDAY, OCT. 27, 1807. 

Luther Martin has just made his final immersion into 
the daily bath of his faculties, after a series of appari 
tions, in all the phases of his accustomed orbit. Whether 
in a stage-coach, or a tavern, he is indefatigable, under 
the united stimulus of egotism and benevolence, to harrass 
the gratitude or tax the patience of his friends. At 3 
o'clock, A. M., on Saturday morning, at Richmond, he 
joined us in the coach, and neither the privation of sleep, 
nor the fatigue of the journey, have in the least checked 
his loquacity, or lessened his good humor. He read to 



464 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

me an able pamphlet, on the subject of Jefferson's rejec 
tion of the new British Treaty, while we were jolting and 
jarring over as bad a road as any country can lament, 
with more dispatch than I could peruse it in my chair. 
His strong memory made him interesting all the way, in 
his anecdotes and stories; and he is not unhappy in his 
powers of ridicule, which is well pointed, until it soon 
becomes blunted by the suggestions of his benevolence 
and the abrasions of his verbosity, which, like the revo 
lutions of a grindstone, soon wear away the subject ap 
plied to it, without undergoing in itself any sensible dim 
inution. We spent last night at Alexandria, where we 
recruited our strength by a good night's rest, and reached 
this city to*day, by a packet-boat, about 1, P. M. Here, 

at Hotel, Martin has kept up an incessant fire 

against Democrats and the Administration, for he has 
had no want of that ammunition with which he always 
primes and loads for such duty. In our own room, occu 
pied by Commins, Martin and myself, he is not content 
to confine his feats for the gratification of ourselves and 
a few occasional visitors. He has several times carried 
his arms into the enemies' country I mean the public 
room occupied chiefly by members of Congress, with 
many of whom he has no acquaintance, while all admire 
and acknowledge him privileged. I had the satisfaction 
of reading the President's message in half an hour after 
it was communicated to-day to Congress. The news is 
here, that Jefferson will yet support Wilkinson, though 
he may not find a more respectable Democrat than McRae 
to back him. Yet he says nothing in the message of the 
General's honor as a soldier, or his fidelity as a citizen. 



PAMPHLETEERING. 465 

He now speaks only of his energy, which, in conjunction 
with the exertions of the army and the patriotism of the 
militia, dissipated the plots that were formed on the Mis 
sissippi. The same paragraph of the message opens by 
implicating a contingency that may induce the Govern 
ment party in Congress to impeach Mr. Marshall, by sig 
nifying a doubt, whether we have not still the use of our 
necks through the misconduct of the Judge. Should the 
latter suffer, 't were penance for that timidity of conduct, 
which was probably as instrumental in keeping him from 
imbruing his hands in our blood as it was operative in 
inducing him to continue my vexations, to pacify the 
menaces and clamorous yells of the cerberus of Democ 
racy with a sop which he would moisten, at least, with 
the tears of my family. Should this be well founded, 
what pity would sacrifice to his sufferings ; and if it is 
undoubtedly true, that in a private conversation he had 
with Martin, soon after the latter first arrived in Rich 
mond, he observed to him, " that it would be difficult or 
dangerous for a jury to venture to acquit Burr, however 
innocent they might think him," who hence will believe 
that the greatest talents lodged in such nerves are not, 
when exercised in the judgment-seat, rather a public 
curse executed on a nation, than a natural blessing con 
ferred upon the individual. Besides, the seasonable ap 
pearance, at this crisis, of a pamphlet by J. Daveiss, the 
Judge's brother-in-law, and late District Federal Attorney 
for Kentucky, removed from his office, for his premature 
and unsuccessful prosecution of Burr ; the indiscriminate 
censure, in this pamphlet, of Jefferson, "Wilkinson and 

Burr ; the probable information the Judge must have had

of this intended publication, when he opened to the pros 
ecutors as wide a field of investigation as they desired on 
their motion for our recommitment ; and, in short, the 
well-known spirit of clanship and co-operation with 
which the Marshalls and all their connections are so uni 
formly animated all these motives will clearly explain 
how readily the Judge must be disposed to favor alike 
the ruin of Burr, "Wilkinson and Jefferson, in every thing 
short of murder. Ah ! generous and accomplished Mer 
cer, how will your virtues hereafter receive my devotions, 
if you should think them polluted with these blasphemies 
against the admired relative of your adored ? But as my 
reflections are penned for no eye but that of my wife and 
two or three confidential friends, it will not be suspected 
by those who know my heart, that whatever share of 
further sufferings may result to me from the conduct of 
the Judge, can in the least generate my suspicions of his 
integrity, or warp my judgment of his behavior. Com- 
mins leaves this early to-morrow morning, for Balti 
more, where I expect to join him the day after to-mor- 
morrow. I entertain strong hopes of being able to 
obtain some negroes in partnership with him. Burr did 
not come along with us from Richmond, but will, we all 
believe, be through here in a day or two. I am enabled 
to say, from separate information I have obtained from 
Martin and Commins, he has made use of all the confi 
dence he could inspire them with, to the utmost extent at 
Richmond, where he has induced them to become his 
securities, in all the civil suits instituted there against him, 
to amount of $36,000. I have no doubt he has set every 
engine of his ingenuity at work to effect this object. The 



PECULATING. 467 

credulity and good nature of Martin, who worships even 
his vices, and is as assiduous in enlarging upon his looks 
and sayings as ever Bos well delighted in such drudgery 
for Johnson ; and the vanity of Commins, to purchase the 
interest of a man whose resources appear to his under 
standing inexhaustible ; both needed but little the col 
lateral security of Pollock, which, however, Burr has not 
only exhibited to them, but he has besides laid before 
them my expectations of succeeding to a large fortune 
in Europe ; thereby meaning to persuade them also, no 
doubt, that he will then control my finances ; although 
he had promised me he would not communicate my pros 
pects of the probability of that event to any one. Such 
is his honor ; such his unerring purpose to take every 
chance of converting even the hopes of his acquaintances 
to his own interest. On the whole, I should be well 
pleased with this last liberty he has taken with me, if it 
should hereafter make a part of that basis on which I 
shall endeavor to ground his effects to arrange my present 
pecuniary demands upon him. It is quite unaccountable 
how he has disposed of all the cash he raised in Kentucky 
last year. Jourdari has convinced me that he, Burr, actu 
ally received through his hands, at Lexington, not less 
than $40,000, of which he never advanced more than 
$15,000 to all his agents and associates, to say nothing of 
all the property he procured upon his drafts. He 
could since have spent but little money, having received 
much from the United States, and having been in custody 
until very lately. I shall, to-morrow, endeavor to investi 
gate the further views of Government upon me. 



468 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1807. 

I have, this morning, written by Martin to Rodney, 
the United States Attorney-General, to request him to 
inform me, officially, whether Government is now dis 
posed to prosecute me any further, in conformity with 
the late adjudication of the Chief Justice, or will finally 
discharge me, as has been done, I hear, in the case of 
Tyler ; or will dispense with my personal appearance at 
Chillicothe until the September session of the Court 
there, as Government can not probably be prepared to 
prosecute at the next January term ; and, in the mean 
time, the occasions of my family, and the serious de 
mands of my private affairs, require my presence at 
Natchez. I am very anxious to receive an answer before 
dinner, in which I much fear I shall not be gratified, 
through my friend M.'s more indispensable devotion to 
his libations. I shall, however, note the result, I hope, 
to-night. 

But I have been disappointed; for, though I spent a 
dollar in coach-hire to go with Martin, this evening, in 
quest of Rodney, we could not see him, as he was not 
returned from the President's, where he dined. Martin, 
I find, is very incontinent of every thing, which ordinary 
discretion should not disclose, where there is no injunc 
tion, in terms of secrecy. He assured me, to-day, he is 
prepared to sacrifice $10,000 for Burr, if the collateral 
security of Pollock should fail ; that it will be nothing 
more than diminishing a provision of so much he had 
made by will for his three daughters, which he had orig 
inally destined for a Miss Thompson, now Mrs. Living- 



WASHINGTON CITY. 469 

ston, to whom he gave an allowance of 600 a year, for 
six or seven years. But her husband is now richer than 
himself; "however, let the worst happen," he added, 
" he had signed blank bonds, which he left to be filled 
up by the attorneys employed against Burr ; " and such 
bonds, he says, are void by late decisions of the English 
Courts, adopted by the Courts here. This would seem 
inconsistent with the warm spirit of integrity which 
seems to breathe in all his thoughts and actions. And 
he declared accordingly, he would not take advantage 
of the circumstance. I also find his idolatrous admira 
tion of Mrs. Alston is almost as .excessive as my own, 
but far more beneficial to his interest, and injurious to his 
judgment, as it is the medium of his blind attachment to 
her father, whose secrets and views past, present, or to 
come, he is, and wishes, to remain ignorant of. NOT 
can he see a speck in the character or conduct of Al 
ston, for the best of all reasons with him ; namely, that 
Alston has such a wife. 

This city has certainly no resemblance to any other 
upon earth. Its extent, as originally laid out, has been 
known for some years past, upon paper; but a few of 
its singular features, as they now smile or frown upon 
the Potomac, are remarkable. As to streets, literally 
speaking, there is not one yet in existence, unless the 
few wide paths and half-made roads that intersect each 
other can be called streets. On a hill, at the head of 
one of these, about a mile from the river, stand the two 
wings, without the body, of what is to constitute, but is 
already called, the Capitol. They are cumbrous, ill-pro 
portioned, piles of building to my eye ; with too small a 



470 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

space for the central building, if ever reared. About 
another mile's distance, to the westward, stands the Presi 
dent's house, with a low dead-wall in front, and an 
ordinary post-and-rail fence in the rear of it. On either 
side of it, stands what are called its wings, which any 
person would require to be told were such before he could 
believe it ; for they are of brick, and at too great a dis 
tance to appear to belong to the large White House be 
tween them any more than to the Capitol. They are each 
a row of ordinary brick houses ; in those to the West is 
kept the Post-office ; in those to the East, the Secretary 
of State's office is, etc. ; and both, it is said, are to be con 
nected with the center by a garden. But the last feature 
of architecture has not yet made its appearance. From 
the Capitol you behold, in four or five different directions, 
at the distance of from one to four miles apart, rows of 
houses, each of five or six together, so that the whole 
appears like a jumble of fragments of villages, except 
that part, being one and a half mile north-east of the 
Capitol, where the Navy-yard is said to stand, which is 
more built up than any other quarter of the city. But 
after all, every foreigner, after his arrival here, will in 
quire for fifty years to come, as is now very common, 
" where is the city of Washington ? " Martin visited Rob. 
Smith this evening, where he heard Wilkinson extolled, 
and Burr as heavily denounced, as if he had not yet been 
tried. Mr. and Mrs. Smith declared Government had 
abundant proofs against Burr, which they could not pro 
duce from confidential restrictions. Martin, before he 
left them, convinced himself they would gladly dispense 
with his visit. 



NO WAR! 471 

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1807. 

I went this morning with Martin, in a carriage, to visit 
Rodney, before breakfast. R. is a trifling negative char 
acter, from whose manner I could at once perceive he had 
yesterday spoken with Jefferson of my arrival here. He 
abruptly told us, " Government meant certainly to pro 
ceed against us ; " on which he was received with a volley 
of abuse by Martin, who thanked his God for the news, 
as Government would thereby hasten the consummation 
of their own infamy. Rodney seemed surprised to learn 
from us that not a single witness had as yet been bound 
or summoned to appear in Ohio. I told him, as my call 
upon him was in his official character, I would leave him 
the letter I had yesterday written to him, which he prom 
ised he would, and did, answer this evening, by three or 
four lines, saying, " he could only observe, at present, that 
I would be bound to attend, pursuant to the recognizance 
I entered into at Richmond. So he is also trained to 
teaze, if he can not injure, the infidels who worship not 
the divinity of Jefferson. Martin has solemnly pledged 
himself to meet Government, at the sitting of the Court 
in January, in Ohio ; to see things are conducted regu 
larly, so far as may concern Burr and me, whether we 
personally appear there or not. He has found out from 
Robert Smith, that Jefferson has no thoughts of war 
with Britain, of which he has so much affected the con 
trary ; for he will never act as he speaks or writes ; he 
will always counteract his political professions by his 
back-stairs committees, until Jack Randolph shall finally 
sever him from them. Burr, I hear, is arrived at George- 



472 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

town, three miles from hence, up the river. If so, he 
will probably be of our party to-morrow, to Baltimore. 
"We set off at five in the morning, in the stage. Several 
northern members of Congress, whose names I know not, 
have had the curiosity or politeness to visit us. From 
one of them I was truly concerned to learn the death of 
Mr. Hunt, which happened last July, as he himself pre 
dicted, on his new purchase at French Grant, on the 
Ohio. This place has been extremely tiresome to me. 
The taverns are very dear, and badly kept; so that I shall 
leave it with pleasure. I wrote to-day to my landlord, 
"Walton, John Banks, and my wife, to gratify, as far as I 
could, all their cares and solicitude for my future desti 
nies. To all I acknowledged that tribute I so justly owe 
to Martin, who, with better breeding, and a redemption 
from his habits of inebriety, would be a perfect character. 
His heart is truly overflowing with the purest milk of 
benevolence. His potations may sometimes, perhaps, co 
agulate, but they will never acidify the fluid with which 
it is so well replenished. May it never be wasted on the 
unworthy. 

"WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 30, 1807. 

Rose before five this morning; but, as the coach then 
drove up with a cargo of eleven passengers, I have been 
detained here another day. I have borne the ennui, with 
which I have spent it, with such patience that I would 
not walk fifty yards from the tavern to visit the Hall of 
Congress, or observe how they ballot there for their 
officers or their committees ; though I certainly should 
have gone so far to hear a debate, had there been any. 



GENEROUS BARBER. 473 

The election of officers reminds me of a curious Repub 
lican caper at Richmond, last winter, which, as it was of 
a negative nature, can not be recorded in that State, but 
should be known every-where else, to convict it of im 
moral conduct, if not of impiety. It was nothing more 
than a " remembering to forget," on the part of the Legis 
lature, I mean the house of delegates, during the whole 
session, the immemorial custom to appoint a chaplain. 
Burr, I hear again, is somewhere in this city. But I no 
more depend upon his appearance than on that of a new 
comet. We start to-morrow again. 

BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 1, 1807. 

Before I mention my having arrived here, at last, I shall 
note the generosity of my barber at Washington, who re 
luctantly received three-quarters of a dollar from me, be 
cause I observed to him, " I should give him more than 
his charge, if I was not rather poor at present." And he 
evinced his sincerity by assuring me he had $100 at my 
service, which he requested me to accept. How is this to 
be accounted for? Devereux, Hendren, O'Hennessy, and 
Butler will all exclaim, " He was an Irishman ! " So he 
is : his name is Dixon, and it shall ever remain recorded 
in the duties of my gratitude. Yesterday, Martin and 
myself were wedged in among ten other passengers in the 
coach. A Mr. Blount, brother of the late Governor of 
Tennessee, was of the number. He is an infuriated Demo 
crat, was at the battle of Germantown, and ordered the 
aim of the riflemen who shot General Agnew in that 
affair. I saw Tyler on alighting from the coach, who 
showed me his discharge, in the handwriting of Rodney, 



474 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

whom he declares he has not seen, having received it 
from Captain Pike, who escorted him to Washington 
City. Tyler denies his having made any deposition 
against me any where, and professes his friendship and 
attachment to Burr, whom he is very anxious to see 
before he sets out for New York with Sam. Swartwout. 
To-day I left my cards at Pringle's and the Gilmore's. 
Of these families, I only saw Mrs. Wm. Gilmore, who 
seemed glad to see me. I have a little curiosity to collect 
in my fallen fortune as many exceptions as I can establish 
to the general condemnation of mankind pronounced 
upon them by the adversity of individuals. I break 
fasted with Martin, and shall dine with him to-morrow, 
as well as all the Burrites in town. Burr, I hear, was, 
last night, at Georgetown. His appearance here is as 
much a matter of curiosity with his enemies as of inter 
est with his friends. But the elements of his orbit, I 
repeat, are as unsettled as those of a new comet. Mar 
tin thinks he might have been detained to raise money 
enough to pay his tavern-bills, etc., while Commins says 
Burr assured him he should suffer no detention on that 
account. So it uniformly turns out, that no two persons 
of his acquaintance will ever understand him alike ; and 
yet all who still adhere to him profess a unity of con 
fidence in him. Commins has brought on a fever by 
his debaucheries. I shall stay here at least till Wed 
nesday. 11, P. M. 

BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 2, 1807. 

I spent the principal part of the morning with Martin, 
reading the papers and conversing with various visitors 



ROGUES' MARCH. 475 

he received. The news we deemed worthy of most notice 
"before dinner, was that of two arrivals in town, namely, 
Wilkinson's baggage, preparatory to his taking up his 
quarters at Fort McIIenry, near this city, and Burr's 
appearance at the French Hotel in Gay street. So the 
Brigadier, as I expected, will probably never revisit the 
Mississippi in his present command, nor probably long 
retain it here, notwithstanding all the control he may pos 
sess over the heart of Jefferson, and though he boasted, 
not long since, at Richmond, that he would be at Natchez 
in thirty days. Burr will probably show himself as little 
as possible to the public. He has, therefore, sneaked into 
obscure quarters, though Steward, who now manages this 
house since Evans's death, declared he would accommo 
date Col. Burr and his friends with as much attention in 
their adversity as he could have done in the days of their 
better fortune. The expression of this sentiment was 
drawn from him on the occasion of some illiberal Demo 
crats threatening to leave the house, if we were received 
into it. I dined with Martin, who had a select party, 
though he left out two Burrites, Tyler and Luckett. 
Burr called upon Martin, for a few moments, before din 
ner. He returned in the evening, and had a long confer 
ence with Tyler in an adjoining room ; during which the 
attention of our party in the dining-room was called forth 
to receive, at the windows, some public honors offered 
to us from the street. A desperate Democratic printer, 
commanding a company of one of the city regiments, 
whose name is Frely, drew up his men under the win 
dows, and there halted, while his fife and drum played 
the " Rogues' March " for us ; then gave three cheers, and 



476 THE BLENNEKHASSETT PAPERS. 

marched off. This salutation has prepared fresh fuel to 
keep up the blaze of Martin's wrath against all his oppo 
nents. Burr, on his return with Tyler to us, said, " these 
excesses of indecency always recoil on those who enter 
into them ; " and he soon after withdrew, not evidently 
indifferent to such manifestations of public regards, 
which, however, I am sure, Martin will make his own 
use of with good effect against "Wright, the Governor of 
Maryland, whom Martin first brought into notice, which 
the Governor no longer remembers. I left soon after, that 
is, about 8, P. M., but did not go to bed till 11. At 10, 
I had a long conversation with Tyler, who, I find, has 
long since taken up all my impressions of Burr, and will 
spare no labor to infuse his opinions into the prejudices 
of Colonel Swartwout, whom, he has no doubt, he will 
induce to adopt his sentiments. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1807. 

Having accidentally met Hayden, the dentist, this 
morning, who mentioned to me the late arrival, at the 
Academy, of a grand electrical machine, I could not sup 
press my wishes to see it. Hayden obligingly offered to 
walk there with me, which I accepted. He introduced 
me to the Principal of the Seminary, who received me 
very politely, and presented me to a Mr. Paguet, who 
took upon him the exhibition of the powers of the ma 
chine. This was a superb plate of forty-six French inches 
diameter, with a conductor, forming three sides of a par 
allelogram, one of them in front of, and parallel to, the 
plate ; the two others, perpendicular to it. The machine, 
with two turns of the plate, gave sparks twelve inches

long, and charged a battery, about fifteen feet of coated 
glass, in ten turns, which killed a duck. On my return 
from the seminary, I repaired to L. Martin's, where one 
of his students informed me he expected a mob would 
this evening attack the house, and offer violence to Mr. 
Martin, Col. Burr and myself, of which notice had been 
given by hand-bills, which had been circulated through 
the town. Martin was not at home. I eagerly sought a 
view of one of the bills, which is in these words : 

" AWFUL ! ! ! 

" The public are hereby notified that four < choice spir 
its ' are this afternoon, at 3 o'clock, to be marshaled for 
execution by the hangman, on Gallows Hill, in conse 
quence of the sentence pronounced against them by the 
unanimous voice of every honest man in the community. 
The respective crimes for which they suffer are thus 
stated on the record : first, Chief Justice M. for a repeti 
tion of his X. Y. Z. tricks, which are said to be much 
aggravated by his felonins capers in open Court, on the 
plea of irrelevancy ; secondly, His Quid Majesty, charged 
with the trifling fault of wishing to divide the Union, 

and farm Baron Bastrop's grant ; thirdly, B , the 

chemist, convicted of conspiring to destroy the tone of 
the public Fiddle ; fourthly, and lastly, but not least, 
Lawyer Brandy-Bottle, for a false, scandalous, malicious 
Prophecy, that, before six months, * Aaron Burr would 
divide the Union.' N". B. The execution of accomplices 
is postponed to a future day." 

My first inquiries of the few acquaintances I met in the 
streets, who now know me, were directed by a desire to 



478 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

acquire some estimate of what we might expect in the 
evening ; but I obtained little satisfaction. I then thought 
Burr might be best informed, as his vigilance I had be 
fore proved to be lively at all times, was most sharp on 
the approach of danger. I know not whether Tyler had 
smelt out what was brewing before I had heard any thing 
about it, but found, on my return from the seminary, be 
fore I had heard the news, he had fled rather precipi 
tately ; for he had declared to me, not two hours before I 
last went to seek him, that he should not go away until 
to-morrow. I therefore bent my course straight to Burr, 
at his shabby quarters, in Gay Street, where I waited full 
fifteen minutes before I could see him. I afterward found 
he was packing up his things to escape in the mail, which 
was to leave in ten minutes. He labored hard within, I 
could plainly see, to exhibit that composure of manner, to 
which he has devoted so much of his life, to form his 
exterior by. He would not wait to write the superscrip 
tion of a letter, which he requested me to direct for him 
to David M. Randolph. I bid him adieu, with an assur 
ance that I would follow him to-morrow, and he said I 

should find him at G , in Philadelphia. On my return 

to Evans's, I found Martin, Luckett and Commins in my 
bed-room. Martin defied the menaces of the mob, but 
he assured me he had just left the mayor, who had prom 
ised him to make all necessary arrangements to secure 
the peace of the city, and protect every one from per 
sonal injury. 

Luckett having come by a different way from that I 
took, though I was walking the streets in every direction 
all the morning, told me Burr and Swartwout had been

/ 

escorted by a guard sent them by the mayor, from their 
lodgings to the stage-office, from whence he had seen 
them start, under the good wishes of many spectators. 
Commins denounced the Government and it's rabble, and 
said, it was impossible any thing should- be attempted 
against us ; but I thought otherwise. I deliberated a lit 
tle on the various reports I had heard, however different 
in particulars, yet all agreeing that Martin and myself 
should at least receive an addition to our wardrobe, of a 
suit of tar and feathers. I thought it would not be im 
proper to leave town, or at least change my lodgings 
forthwith. But I soon reflected, how naturally Burr 
might expect to receive unwelcome obloquy for his flight, 
and I at once determined to keep my ground. At din 
ner, therefore, I took my seat, amidst a very large com 
pany, at the long table, and remained there conversing a 
long time with a Frenchman, who sat next me, at least 
half an hour after 3 o'clock, the time designated in the 
hand-bills for the spectacle that was to take place in the 
evening. I should have sat, I know not how much 
longer, had not Steward, who manages the house, brought 
a man up to me, who inquired my name. On giving it 
to him, he said he belonged to the police of the city, and 
had been sent, with several others of that body, to watch, 
and give notice of any attempt upon the public peace, or 
on the persons of individuals. "That the mayor had 
particularly mentioned me to him by name," which I be 
lieved, as he said Mr. Thoroughgood Smith observed to 
him, " he had formerly known me and my lady here." I 
took this man out ; his name is Goldsmith. I then 
ordered liquor for him and his companions in another 



480 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

room, where I. thanked them for the service they, in the 
way of their duty, were come to render me. They 
informed nte, two troops of horse were ordered out, 
and I had nothing to fear. The time passed away in 
conversation with these men, about twelve in number, 
until near 5 o'clock, when I sent Goldsmith to request 
Martin to come to me, as I wished to share his fate, hav 
ing understood from them that I ought not to go out 
of the house, which I interpreted into something like 
a wish on the part of the mayor. Soon after I returned 
to my room to write, Goldsmith came to me with intel 
ligence that Martin could not be seen at his house ; that 
his students and some friends were armed, and well 
prepared to repel an expected assault on the house ; " but 
that the people were in motion in great force, had every 
thing prepared for tarring and feathering," and would, 
he believed, if disappointed or opposed, tear Martin and 
myself to pieces. He then begged of me not to leave the 
room I was in, adding, " that his companions would 
drown him, if they could, in a basin of water, for his 
attention to me, though he was as good a Republican as 
any of them." I now suspected this man might possibly 
direct the drunken desperadoes of an enraged multitude 
to my apartment. I therefore determined to change it 
for another the moment he left me. In a few minutes, 
Steward came up stairs, and told me to go into the gar 
ret, which I soon did, under an apprehension that I was 
betrayed or sought after. In the garret, I observed two 
trap-doors opening through the roof of the house, on 
which I resolved to take my station, from whence I 
might contemplate at my leisure, if I could not distinctly 



THE MOB. 481 

see the scenes that might shortly pass in the streets 
below. Both the trap-doors were open. I shut down 
one of them, and intended to cut off my return into the 
nouse by shutting the other, should it become necessary* 
But an uproar soon rose to my ears from below, and 
from one of the garret windows I saw the mob pass by 
the house, to the amount of about fifteen hundred, as 
well as I could estimate, in full huzza, with fife and drum 
playing the " Rogue's march." I have since learned, they 
drew along with them, in two carts, the representatives, 
habited for execution, of the Chief Justice, Burr, Martin 
and myself. They passed on to Martin's house, in 
Charles-street, where they broke some of his windows, 
and performed some other feats, of which I have not yet 
learned the particulars. In the mean time, two troops of 
cavalry patrolled the streets, not to disperse the mob, but 
to follow and behold their conduct. They, the mob, 
made as much noise as if they were about to destroy the 
city, and returned about 7 o'clock to the point from 
whence they came, headed, I hear, by one Patterson, who 
lives there ; while the cavalry have, I suppose, been long 
since dismissed, in full confidence in the honor of the 
mobility. I have been down stairs to supper at the long 
table. It is now near 10 o'clock, and I have not these 
two hours heard any more of either of them. How far 
the respectable part of the city will think it worth their 
while to show they had no participation in this frolic, 
which, I am informed, was chiefly made up at the " point," 
we shall hereafter learn. I believe it altogether orig 
inated with the Democratic printers here, who are but 

little controlled by one spiritless Federal paper, which is 
31 



482 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

all there is at present on that side ; while there are three 
or more Federal prints supported in Philadelphia, where 
I have no expectation of receiving similar public honors 
to those conferred upon me here. Wrote to Natchez, to 
counteract, by anticipation, the alarms my friends there 
might take up for my safety, from the rapid circulation 
of rumors, etc. 

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1807. 

Went early this morning to Martin's, where I saw Mr. 
Ray, a warm friend to him, who had taken, last night, 
the direction of the gentlemen who had volunteered to 
defend the house. Martin and his property, I found, were 
untouched last night, the mob having contented them 
selves with menaces and abuse, offering a defiance to the 
party within and the cavalry without, from whence I 
conclude that the mayor was intimidated by them and a 
large majority of the two troops of horse, well disposed 
to their views or their leaders ; namely, one Biayo, and 
others from the " point." Martin did not appear to his 
friends until this morning. I took leave of him on my 
way to the packet, by which I set out for Philadelphia, 
where I arrived, with no occurrence during the journey, 
on Thursday, 5th of November, at 3 o'clock, P. M. Put 
up at the Mansion House, late Bingham's, kept by an 
Englishman, in the best style I ever saw in America. 
Dined, dressed, and visited Burr and my worthy friends, 
Mr. and Mrs. Jos. Lewis. Burr pretended he should 
have waited, if he had not believed every thing at Balti 
more would have ended with the hand-bills. He was 
very glad to hear of Martin's having so well escaped, and 



IN PHILADELPHIA. 483 

said lie would give Bollman, who boarded where I did, a 
letter of introduction to me. I observed to him, that 
probably Dr. Bollman did not wish my acquaintance, as 
he had never called upon me in Richmond. Burr tried 
to excuse this, but failed. He is trying to live here 
incog., but every one knows he is in town. I supped 
with Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, en famiUe, where my friendly 
reception, kind inquiries, and the interesting conversa 
tion of my amiable friends, agreeably detained me until 
midnight, when I took leave, with a promise to dine 
with them to-morrow. 

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1807. 

Spent the morning chiefly in examining the newspapers 

and visits to the Lewises, Conrad, C h and Turnbull's 

families, as my friend Joe Lewis's dinner-hour is 2 o'clock. 
Before I went there, I had a call from R. Lewis, to bring 
me a letter from Walton, of no importance, and engage 
me to dinner with him to-morrow. Passed the evening 
sociably, tete-a-tte, with Joe L. ; during which I was 
chiefly occupied in conversation with him on the subject 
of Burr's trials and adventures, and also that of my pres 
ent financial derangements. About 7, P. M., we were 
called into the street by an alarm of fire, which turned 
out to be groundless ; and I saw him back to his house, 
where I then left him, to return to my lodgings, as I had 
a severe headache. Before I went to bed, I observed that 
the " American," a Democratic paper of Baltimore, con 
tained an invidious paragraph approving of the insults 
offered to us there last Tuesday evening. Bollman has left 
his card with me, with a letter of introduction from Burr. 



484 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1807. 

At breakfast, this morning, Bollman presented himself 
to me upon his credentials, and I received him into my ac 
quaintance with all the ease of courtly etiquette I am mas 
ter of. I invited him to take a seat by me, and entered 
into conversation with him on general topics, which was 
sustained for half an hour, and succeeded by his obliging 
me with his view of the Mississippi country, and particu 
larly the environs of New Orleans, for which he enter 
tained a decided preference to any other quarter, and pro 
jects, probably without the command of a dollar, nothing 
less than the purchase of an estate, at $60,000, within five 
miles of that city. Daniel Clark has assured him it is a 
great bargain, as it will yield a revenue of $15,000 a year 
by adding a few slaves to those already on it ; and Boll 
man only wants a friend or two to join with $10,000 each, 
and he can effect the rest. I have little doubt Bollman 
has conceived I may be of use to him in this affair ; but 
I am certain he can not serve me in it. Mrs. David Ran 
dolph had no small trial of her skill in detecting this 
man's character, if her judgment has not erred in the 
attempt; for his countenance, manner and address possess 
every qualification to engage the warmest interest in his 
favor as a scholar, a gentleman, or perhaps a gallant. Yet 
he has formerly failed in this town as a merchant, rather 
through his excesses in speculation and intrigue than from 
any natural inaptitude to that sort of life. And his late 
wife's family discovered enough in him to determine them 
to oppose his connection with the N. family as far as was 
possible. But I will, at present let him rest. I dined 



HEALTH RESTORED. 485 

and spent the early part of the evening with R. Lewis, in 
the same way I did yesterday with his brother, that is, 
in the enjoyment of good wines and friendly conversation. 
I must, however, partake of no more of these early din 
ners, as the long sittings that succeed them leave no time, 
these short days, to transact whatever business may yet 
detain me here. Duane has announced the arrival of 
Admiral Blennerhassett, at the Mansion House, and re- 
published, from the " Baltimore Whig," its invitation to 
invest us with a suit of " Yankee ermine," as well as the 
process-verbal of the mobility of that city. But I shall 
visit this apostle of Democracy on Monday. 

SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1807. 

Visited, this morning, by Tom. Butler, who made me 
very happy, by learning from him my beloved wife had 
quite recovered from her fever, and she and the boys were 
well after the middle of last September, when he saw them. 
While I was attending the service at the Roman Catholic 
chapel in Fourth Street, I had the honor of morning vis 
its from sundry great personages, who left their cards for 
me ; namely, Burr, Bollman and George Pollock, reputed 
to be very rich, whose education, I have heard, Burr has 
had some concern with, and at whose house here he has 
taken up his quarters. After my return from Mass, I was 
visited by a Mr. Reckless, of New Jersey, who seems a 
warm partisan of Burr, and is engaged in endeavoring to 
do away an indictment, pending in that State against 
Burr, for the killing of General Hamilton. Upon the re 
moval of this impediment, I find Burr means to try the 
effect of requisitions upon a considerable party he consid- 



486 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ers attached to him in that quarter. Mr. R. treated me with 
much consideration, and said, " while I was abroad, some 
members of the Jersey Legislature had come with him to 
wait upon me." I find, indeed, the greater part of the 
numerous strangers who frequent the Mansion House re 
gard me with no common attention. I form acquaintances 
among them without previous introductions ; but this is 
more to be attributed to the sinking of Democracy here 
into the coalition of the Federals and Quids, which has 
nearly annihilated the faction of Duane, than to any 
claim I could have upon public favor from the merit of 
my acts or the singularity of my fortune. I have, among 
others, met here with a Mr. B., from Charleston, South 
Carolina, who has traveled much, and has embellished 
good talents with much accomplishments. 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1807. 

Conversed for half an hour, after breakfast, with Boll- 
man, chiefly upon medical and physiological subjects, in 
which I was much pleased with some novelty of fancy 
recommended by that suavity of manner and easy address 
which endanger the judgment of those who listen to him. 
I had invitations from Pollock and Joe Lewis for din 
ner to-morrow. Dined with Turnbull, spent part of the 
evening with Tom. Butler, and supped with Joe Lewis en 
famille, where I sat until midnight. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1807. 

Soon after breakfast, visited Burr and Pollock. Burr 
has again opened an audience-chamber, which is much 
occupied. Although I found two or three friends with 



SUDDEN FLIGHT. 487 

him at breakfast, he was called out the moment he had 
finished, and was absent about an hour and three-quar 
ters, during which interval Mr. Pollock gave me his 
company. I find him a very well-bred man, who has had 
advantages in Europe. He spoke less of Mrs. Alston than 
I expected, and has never seen her husband, whose vari 
ous talents, however, he does not the less correctly esti 
mate. "With respect to Burr, whatever may have been 
the ground of his present intimacy with Mr. P., I can ven 
ture to affirm, it has already been abused on the part of 
the former, although the latter, as yet, is evidently un 
aware of it. Pollock withdrew, and I entered upon the 
objects of my visit. After informing Burr that Martin was 
resolved to appear for us at Chillicothe, he seemed all sur 
prise ; and nothing could be more natural than the colli 
sion of such generosity with his own ingratitude ; for he 
fled from Baltimore, without waiting even to thank his 
friend for the long and various services he had rendered 
him. Further, he had not written to him from hence. 
On recovering from this new charge of Martin's benevo 
lence upon his feelings, he exclaimed, " What a man ! " 
but told me I must write to him not to think of the jour 
ney till he should hear from him ; that I should direct 
him, in the. mean time, to write to Burnet and Michael 
Baldwin, the late Marshal of Ohio, to retain both (no 
doubt, with Martin's advance of their fees), and that he 
still had no thoughts of going to Ohio, though he had 
given notice to Scott, the Virginia Marshal, to be prepared 
with a guard of gentlemen, by the tenth of December, at 
Richmond, to conduct him from thence to Chillicothe. 
He added, " that Martin's too great zeal and indiscretion 



488 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

would do us great mischief in Ohio, and the skill of Bur- 
net, with the influence of Baldwin, who was popular with 
the blackguards, and exasperated against the Administra 
tion since the loss of his office, were the best means to 
frustrate the efforts of Government to have bills found 
against us, which they would exert themselves to effect, 
to divert his, Martin's, attention from other objects." He 
now again assured me he would be glad I could extri- 
cat^ myself from the Government upon any terms agree 
able to my own feelings, and fully approved of my effect 
ing that object through Duane, in any way my judgment 
might suggest. This business being thus dispatched, I 
next solicited him on the subject of his finances, on which 
indeed he had partly anticipated me, by inquiring, " what 
were my prospects through my friends, the Lewises?" 
I informed him I had no expectations from that quarter, 
and should absolutely starve, while I was possessed of 
such splendid hopes in Europe, if I was not relieved in 
the mean time. He regretted much the absence from 
town of two persons with whom he expected to do some 
thing ; but he had, he said, negotiations on foot, the suc 
cess of which he could not answer for, but should know 
in two or three days. I now represented to him the 
probable necessity I could not resist, of urging Alston, 
but hoped such a measure would not be displeasing to 
him or to Mrs. Alston, Upon this suggestion, he was 
less reserved than he had been with me at Richmond, 
before he was acquainted with my pecuniary views and 
my means of advancing him in Europe, and freely de 
clared neither Mrs. Alston nor himself would be dis 
pleased with any steps I might take against Alston, who 



STILL CRAVING. 489 

had treated him in a manner I could well enough judge of, 
to save him the mortification of expressing his opinion of 
it. He even assured rne he had demanded from Alston 
an explanation of his conduct in addressing the letter to 
Pinckney, immediately on his arrival in custody at Rich 
mond, observing, " that no humiliation of his condition 
could make him forget what he owed to his own dig 
nity ; " that Alston had shown much contrition, and 
made every possible concession, including an offer of 
a public reconciliation in print ; but Burr said he thought 
it would be prudent to spare him this extreme of humili 
ation, I suppose, for his daughter's sake. By the by, it 
is remarkable that many persons of penetration and in 
telligence, who have indulged an eager interest in investi 
gating every thing during the last year relating to Burr, 
within the reach of their inquiries, should have preter- 
mitted that irredeemable passage of Alston's letter, im 
puting to Burr a design to bereave his infant grandson 
of his patrimony. Before Burr returned from the audi 
ence chamber, I found Mr. Pollock had made a like omis 
sion ; and, upon my acquainting him with the circum 
stance, he expressed his feelings suitably of the con 
founded folly and turpitude of the writer, who had long 
before repeated to me assurances he had given his father- 
in-law, that his property was worth one hundred thou 
sand guineas, and he would, if necessary, embark the 
whole of it in the furtherance of Col. Burr's plans. I 
did not leave Burr until he had again reminded me of his 
hopes of my forwarding his views in England ; to which 
I answered, " I could only lend my endeavors to serve 
him by the letters I had already offered him." He said, 



490 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

it was to those only he alluded ; so the baits I have 
thrown out to him do not yet glitter in vain, which further, 
appeared, by his observing to the party present, when 
first I called upon him, " that he supposed I had not yet 
taken the trouble to find out whether a certain man was 
dead or alive, upon whose death I should be entitled to a 
fortune worth, at least, one hundred thousand guineas," 
adding, " I had a strange fund of indifference to objects 
few other men could resist." This was truly well thrown 
out for Pollock, etc. But I was not a little amused to 
observe he had been calculating how many years' pur 
chase my expected estates of 6,000 a year would sell 
for ; so that while this bait glitters he will not lightly 
break from me. Dined and spent the evening with a set 
party at Joe Lewis's. I have found it due to so worthy 
a friend, to offer him a perusal of these notes, as I hope 
they will more fully develop to him my character and 
necessities than he could otherwise become acquainted 
with either; and I took to his aid -and counsel, rather 
than to any other present means, to lighten the actual 
burdens that bear so heavily upon my family. He has 
perused the first volume with so much interest and satis 
faction that he has given it a second reading. This alone 
would be an ample compensation for the little labor I 
have spent upon it. I feel I have penned many reflec 
tions, and passed many characters with my own, in review, 
in a light which should be admitted to few eyes besides 
those of my wife. But I fully rely upon the safe keeping 
of the confidence I have ventured with my friend, who 
will therefore be enabled to take a better view of my suf 
ferings and necessities. I have lost some time in visiting 



OCCUPATIONS. 491 

Duane, which 1 shall not effect before Thursday. There 
are two excellent papers here lately set up against him; 
namely, the "Spirit of the Press" and the "Tickler," 
which would he perfect, if they were not too local. 

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1807. 

Soon after breakfast, I was called, by note, to Lewis's 
counting-house, to meet Bartlett, the partner of Tom 
Hart, of Lexington, who kept me waiting there for him 
the best part of the morning ; but, at last, arrived, and 
paid me $832, being so much saved out of my losses by 
Hart, in 1805. Dined with a formal party at my friend 
R. Lewis's, where I sat with a pleasant set, after dinner, 
until 11 o'clock, and received an invitation to dinner from 
Mr. Tightman, an amiable and convivial young merchant 
of this city, and son of the Judge of that name. Reeve 
let freely loose the flow of soul and of w T ine. He is an 
excellent mimic, and a truly comic character, and might, 
if he had not a far better calling, excel upon the stage. 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1807. 

Occupied this morning, chiefly, by reading the papers, 
particularly a London Courier, containing an excellent 
speech of Sheridan's, or rather only a skeleton of it, on 
Irish affairs. This paper Mr. Bee was kind enough to 
procure for me, without solicitation on my part. Until 
dinner time, I passed the remainder of the morning in 
walking and buying a few articles for my wife. Burr 
has taken an excursion of about twenty miles up the 
Delaware, to return, I expect; on Saturday, when I pro 
pose, in the event of his being still out of cash, to make 



492 , THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

my last demand upon him so long projected ; namely, a 
requisition to him to procure security, to which my family 
can resort, in this country, for my claims upon him, to 
the amount of about $9,000, made up by my account 
already presented to him, and the debt and charges aris 
ing from Miller's demand. The mercantile folks are 
much alarmed with the news of to-day, threatening a 
speedy war with Britain. And I have heard it said, that 
shares in some of the Insurance Stocks have fallen to-day 
ten per cent. But I observe the successful energies of 
my native country against Copenhagen have a petrifying 
effect upon the Democrats, while nineteen-twentieths of 
the merchants, who are Federalists, awfully contemplate 
the approaching crisis with England. This evening, I 
received a novel remedy for a sharp toothache, with 
which I was affected. It was grounded on a principle, 
that great mental engagement and exertion would operate 
a diversion of inordinate action expended upon a small 
diseased portion of the body. I attempted to put this 
fancy to the test, by effecting my too long-neglected in 
terview with Duane. After tea, I set out upon this 
adventure, and arrived at his dwelling in much pain, 
about 8, P. M. I think it deserves notice that I should 
mention, because my feelings were singularly affected by 
the preparation I found I had to undergo, to obtain not 
only an audience of this high priest of Jacobinism, but 
even admission within the walls that contained his Holi 
ness. I had pulled the bell three times, without produc 
ing the common effect of bringing any one to the door 
from within, and was in the act of applying my hand to 
a fourth experiment, when a man answered from with- 



IRISH WELCOME ! 493 

out, an Irishman. He inquired my name, in a full Cork 
accent, but very low voice, and on hearing it, said Mr. 
Duane was not at home, but if I would leave my name 
and business he would mention it to him. I said, I 
should suppose my name was now become familiar 
enough with every one in the employment of Mr. Duane 
to render my leaving it in writing unnecessary. The 
printer's devil replied, " to be sure, every one knew Mr. 
Hassett, and Mr. Duane would be glad to see him." 
While this conversation was passing, Duane, who had 
been listening in the alley adjoining the house, came for 
ward without his hat ; for he had passed from the rear 
of the house into the alley, to spy secretly the chances of 
safety, as he could ascertain them by observing what he 
could see or hear, between his scout and me. The Colonel 
has been further seasoned to the service of his party, of 
which he now begins to feel a little tired, by two drub 
bings, since his return from Richmond ; and as he rises 
in military rank, and suffers in service, he grows more 
wary in caution, and has learned from experience the 
folly of exposing his person by night, without full assur 
ance of the peaceful intentions of his visitor. All scru 
ples of this sort being removed upon the present occasion, 
I apologized for the unusual hour I had fallen upon for 
my visit, which had seemingly broken in upon the Col 
onel while he was engaged with business or company, as 
he had been denied to me, though I was fortunate enough 
to find him at home. To this I received some blundering 
answer; the scout withdrew, and I was invited into the 
house, where I was introduced to Mrs. Duane. 

In a few minutes I signified a desire to speak with the 



494 THE BLEXNERIIASSETT PAPERS. 

Colonel in private. Upon this suggestion he took up a 
candle, and I followed him up stairs. I opened the inter 
view by informing him that I could not leave town with 
out calling to thank him for the visit and friendly offers 
I had received from him during my imprisonment in 
Richmond ; that I felt disposed to regard his motives to 
that visit as distinct from considerations of party or poli 
tics, the mere dictates of national feelings, and the natu 
ral impulse of an Irishman to serve a suffering country 
man in distress ; that, besides this motive to my visit, I 
felt much curiosity, and some personal interest, to learn 
how far he approved of the determination of Government 
to pursue me with further and indefinite prosecutions, 
which could add nothing in their result to the public 
interest or the credit of the Administration, however they 
might diminish or ruin my fortune ; that, although it 
might be deemed politic to keep Col. Burr busy by such 
vexations, Government could apprehend nothing from 
me, and at all events I was sure he could not approve of 
the vindictive spirit that had even refused to dispense 
with my personal appearance at Chillicothe, next Janu 
ary, when Government can not be prepared to go to trial, 
much less shall I ; then, reminding him of the offers he 
had made me at Richmond, I said, my situation at present 
was very different, as it regarded my connection with 
Col. Burr, from what it was at that time ; for I, now re 
garded myself as cleared from all charges that the Gov 
ernment had failed to establish against me, and no longer 
felt it incumbent upon me to undergo endless prosecu 
tions to vindicate whatever concern I had in Col. Burr's 
speculations, especially as he probably will never renew 



WITH DUANE.| 495 

them ; and if he could, I should have no further concern 
in them. 

I had no need to sound any deeper in the shallow wa 
ters of my research, which by no means possess that 
depth that is commonly supposed. Burr had advised me 
that this man loved wonderfully to hear himself talk, 
and that the best way was to let him run on until he 
was out of breath, and afterward take him back to those 
points on which he had stumbled, and on which I wished 
to fasten his attention. The hint was serviceable, and I 
made more use of it than I might have done if I had de 
pended upon the reserve Duane affected on his visit to me 
in the Penitentiary, which I now see arose from a dis 
covery he soon made on that occasion, that he durst not 
broach the unhallowed purpose for which he then visited 
me, which was a bargain to induce me to betray my en 
gagements or connections ; while, on the present occa 
sion, he considered me rather as a politician assailing his 
interest underhand, than a suitor soliciting his good 
offices. I concluded my observations with stating that I 
understood Colonel Burr meant again to surrender him 
self into the custody of the Marshal of Virginia, with 
intent to be conveyed from Richmond, about the tenth of 
next month, to Chillicothe, at the public expense, and if I 
should not soon discover that Government would decline 
further proceedings against me, I should immediately 
prepare to commence the expenditure of so much of the 
public money as the law would allow me toward the 
charges of my defense, which had not hitherto cost the 
United States a dollar. But I wished him to be assured 
it was not my purpose to ask any favors from Govern- 



496 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

ment at any time, or through any quarters whatever, my 
chief object in making him this present visit being to 
learn, as far as I could through him, whether the Admin 
istration still preserved a spirit of hostility to me person 
ally? He now launched out into abuse of Burr and 
Marshall, and said, the Government were committed with 
the sentiments of the majority of the people, who would 
never be satisfied without our conviction on such full evi 
dence as had come out, particularly that of Wilkinson, 
Dunbaugh and the Hendersons ; that it would look like 
persecution of Burr, to grant me any forbearance, and 
that the Chief Justice must atone for his conduct to the 
country. Luther Martin, he declared, had lately done 
Burr more harm than his enemies could have wished in 
the public sentiment, by his silly and intemperate publi 
cations. Wilkinson, he acknowledged, was as much con 
cerned in Burr's schemes as Burr himself; but his excul 
pation was not only due to him, from his seasonable 
discovery and overthrow of the plot, but his country 
should canonize him for it, and the Government could 
never sufficiently requite him. He declared he, Duane, 
had a regular correspondence with Hay, who, he would 
not believe, had ever censured or neglected to vindicate 
the General. I expressed my surprise at his entertaining 
such sentiments seriously, however he might advance 
them in his paper ; but he was frank enough to protest 
to me that he considered Gallatin* now the most danger 
ous man in the country ; Randolph was mad; Burr might 
still play the part of Coriolanus or Alcibiades ; but Jeffer-

son and Madison were the only men on whom the coun 
try could depend, though he had no doubt Monroe would 
have been President, had it not been for the interference 
of Randolph, which had ruined his prospects. As for him 
self, he had been proposed as senator, during his attend 
ance at Richmond, without his knowledge, which was the 
reason he had lost his election. Mr. Erskine's dispatches, 
which had been used as a trap to ensnare him, only con 
tained some newspaper S) and he had defeated the scheme 
by forwarding them after the mail. It appears plainly 
from this sketch, that we have authority for knowing the 
present party in power are divided among themselves ; 
that the Chief of the nation is still afraid of Burr, which 
is further proved by his own indiscretion ; for Jefferson 
has lately said, that whenever Burr could get to the 
Netherlands, he could command $400,000. Yet Duane 
continues his daily attacks upon Burrism, and complains 
a good deal of Burr being in town, though his bothered 
runners can not find out where he lives. Before I left 
him, he affected to disapprove of the late rising in Balti 
more, no doubt, because he can't excite the good people 
of this town to another here. He seemed surprised to 
learn I had the hardihood to dine and sup in public, on 
the day my eflagy was executed ; and when I told him I 
was always provided with a brace of pistols, he twirled 
on his seat. Having given him this impression for the 
benefit of himself and his friends, I left him, in perfect 
freedom from my toothache. I returned to the Mansion 
House, where I passed the remainder of the evening in 

miscellaneous conversation with several agreeable men.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1807. 

I have nothing material to note to-day, except my din 
ing and spending the evening with Mr. Edward T , 

whose hospitality but too successfully seduces the pru 
dence of his guests. 

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1807. 

Took a family dinner, to-day, with Jos. Lewis, who had 
yesterday appointed to take me, this evening, to see a fine 
grazing farm, about six miles from town, belonging to a 
man of the name of Sickle, at the confluence of the Dela 
ware and Schuylkill. We set out in Lewis's carriage, in 
company with a Mr. Hamilton, a very amiable English 
man, who formerly belonged to the Navy, is curious in 
paintings, of which he has a handsome collection that I 
have not yet seen, and keeps a small and well-regulated 
academy with much credit. We reached the place early 
enough to see it and the fine cattle belonging to it, to 
gether with a remarkably beautiful heifer, at a neighbor 
ing plantation of Sickle's, on our way homeward. This 
heifer, about three years old, besides her fine make, would 
weigh, it is said, fifteen hundred pounds. The farm was 
remarkable for its banks, faced with stone, and luxuriant 
pastures, of which, however, a great deal is wasted for 
want of better care, notwithstanding the crops of hay 
taken off" every spring and summer. 

SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1807. 

I am much mortified by my detention here, through the 
probably delusive hopes Burr has held out to me of the 



BAD TASTE. 499 

probable success of his efforts to raise money. I have 
almost let slip the season for descending the Ohio, for 
there is much appearance of an early winter ; and thus 
will another item be probably added to the long account 
of my sufferings by this man. 

Wrote to my wife ; read and dined at home with a com 
pany of about thirty, among whom were counted individ 
uals of thirteen different nations, and General Moreau, 
who sets out, to-morrow, for New Orleans, with a single 
companion, in the stage, by the way of Pittsburgh. The 
General spoke to nobody; but his companion, Bollman, 
assures me he is a man of little speech and no ideas, 
except on military affairs ; so that I had no loss in dining 
with a conversable party at a distant part of the table. 
Wrote this evening to Luther Martin and Doctor Com- 
mins, to put the former off his design of going to Chilli- 
cothe for Burr and myself, and to remind the latter of my 
intention to travel with him, and have a concern in his 
negro purchases. 

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1807. 

Bollman, to-day, handed me a printed estimate of the 
value and yearly profits of sugar estates in the Orleans 
territory, furnished him by Daniel Clark, now here, who 
will decline visiting me, I apprehend, until I shall have 
extinguished the last spark of Burrism within me, with 
which, I suspect, he has been sufficiently singed to dread 
the fire. Spent the best part of the morning shopping, 
after some conversation with Bollman, who further rec 
ommends himself by a disclosure of his family affairs and 
narrow circumstances, unsought altogether on my part. 



500 THE BLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The result of Clark's statement is a yearly return, in 
Acadia county, of twenty-eight per cent, on the capital 
invested, and twenty-two in the vicinity of Orleans, which 
is represented superior to any thing farming can produce 
any where else, hecause no more, in fact, than one-third 
of the capital is advanced for the first installment, the 
produce of the estate clearing itself in four years. But, 
though examples are given of what has been done by two 
or three planters for as many successive years in the vicin 
ity of Orleans, the counties of Acadia and La Fourche, as 
yet, do not furnish experience of what might be expected 
in those situations, and the best management and no acci 
dents are presumed. 

Supped this evening with Joe Lewis, and on my return 
home was blest with a letter from my beloved wife, which 
I found on my bedroom table, and probably was for 
warded, under cover from Baltimore, to Burr, as it had 
no postmark, and did not reach me through Lewis. This 
letter is of 28th of September, at which time all was well 
at Natchez. 

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1807. 

Had a note from Burr, this morning, to dine with 
him to-morrow at 4 o'clock, which invitation I have 
accepted, in anticipation of mixing, probably for the last 
time, with a few of his choice spirits. Spent the evening 
and supped, en famille, agreeably with Joe Lewis. There 
is a great fall of snow since yesterday. R. Lewis has 
solicited to see my notes, which I could not refuse. He 
pledged his discretion, in which I fully confide. 



DAVIESS S PAMPHLET.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1807. 

So much of these short mornings is consumed with 
visits, the papers, and the unavoidable waste of time 
that can not be denied to acquaintances only, that little 
business can be dispatched by me before dinner, when 
that call must be answered at 2, or even 3, o'clock. 
To-day, however, I did a little shopping before I came 
home to dress for Burr's party, which I joined at half- 
past four, consisting only of Mr. Biddel, one of his most 
attached friends, and brother to the notary public here, 
Dav. Randolph, Tom. Butler, Doctor Commins, Mr. Pol 
lock, Burr and myself. The party was as insipid as pos 
sible. Burr is evidently dejected; and though he often 
affected to urge and enliven the conversation, it lan 
guished through the stupidity of Randolph, the uncon 
cern of Pollock, the vacant reserve of Commins, the in 
capacity of Butler, the nothingness of Biddel, and the 
aversion of myself to keep it up, until 8 o'clock, when 
it expired ; and I took leave soon after the entrance of a 
General Nichol, who seemed another of Burr's gaping 
admirers, and much resembles, in manner, breeding and 
intellect, General Rupel, of Kentucky. Thus ended the 
last invitation I shall ever probably receive from this 
American Chesterfield, who is fast approaching the limits 
of that career he has so long run, through the absurd 
confidence of so many dupes and swindlers. I had yes 
terday put into my hands, for the first time, by David 
Randolph, Joe Daviess's pamphlet. It is a hasty, pas 
sionate performance, seldom alluding particularly to me 
by name, but bearing hard upon Jefferson's hypocrisy 



502 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

and neglect of the author, and the early information he 
gave him of Burr's designs and first movements. The 
book will, with all its defects, mortify Jefferson, by prov 
ing to the world that he would at no time open his eyes 
or ears to Wilkinson's intrigues with the Spanish Govern 
ment, and, therefore, to use an expression of the author, 
" the President is as much espanishized as the Brigadier." 
It has also great merit in its comments, and the parody it 
contains on Jefferson's communication of last January to 
Congress, on Burr's operations last winter on the Ohio and 
Mississippi, which has very much diverted me. This per 
formance, together with Judge Marshall's last volume of 
the Life of Washington, exposing the origin and views of 
the present Democratic party in power, have, by this time, 
I have no doubt, inspired Jefferson with a more deadly 
hatred of the Marshall faction than he has ever con 
ceived of all the Burrites he ever heard of. I was present 
ed, to-day, by a Mr. Nolta, a young Italian, who has often 
met Wilkinson at parties in New Orleans, with a caricature 
of that General & la Falstaff. It is a good resemblance, 
and pleased me, though it is not thought as well done as 
another he has made of Edw. Livingston, as a companion 
to the first, under the title of Lawyer Greyhound. I have 
paid my second week's bill here, amounting, in the whole, 
to about thirty dollars ; and for this, though I do not dine 
at home half my time, I can not have a fire in my room. 

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1807. 

Visited, this morning, the infant Academy of the Arts, 
lately established here, with Joseph Lewis, who is a sub 
scriber to the Institution, and showed me the way from 



PAINTINGS. 503 

his counting-house, where I pass half an hour every 
morning. The present collection, in a well contrived 
building, at the upper end of Chestnut Street, is slender 
in paintings ; all of which, however, I did not stay long 
enough to examine. Two fine large ones, by West, of 
scenes from Lear and Hamlet, are lent for exhibition 
by their owner Mr. Fulton ; and there are few other orig 
inals of much value, for painters will, for at least a 
century yet, find too much encouragement in Europe to 
permit the establishment of an American school. But 
the many fine casts taken, by permission, of Bonaparte, 
and now exhibited here, offer a feast to better connoisseurs 
than myself, of high relish. During the little time I 
spent there, however, I was highly pleased, among a 
great number my notice was directed to by Lewis, to 
contemplate, particularly, a large and a small Venus de 
Medicis, of which I did not like the line of straight con 
tinuation between the nose and the forehead, so justly 
condemned by Lavater. I speak of the larger of the two, 
which otherwise is exquisite. The other one is a copy in 
marble of Yenus coming out of the bath ; has a better 
face, and is extremely beautiful. The group of Laacoon 
and the Apollo of Belvidere are perfect to my admiration, 
which would not be exhausted upon them for hours ; and 
the Farnesian Hercules is as well copied in our Lavater 
as ever an engraving represented a piece of sculpture 
But Lewis's early dinner hour was at hand, and my appe 
tite for these morceaux was obliged to give way to his for 
his beefsteaks ; so I made only a first offering, on this 
occasion, of my admiration to the artists of antiquity, 
with a devout hope of discharging the full debt of my 



504 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

homage hereafter to them, when I shall speak more of 
this Institution. 

Dined with Lewis very agreeably, as usual, and, in the 
evening, young Mr. Coates, son of Samuel Coates, whom 
we knew here in '96, stepped in and invited me to dinner 
for next Monday, at his country place on the Schuylkill, 
to join a small party. 

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1807. 

Having determined, last Wednesday, I would not see 
two days more pass away without leaving my ultimatum 
with Burr, I set out this morning for his quarters, re 
solved to burst the cobweb duplicity of all his evasions 
with me upon money matters. It will be seen every 
where in these notes, how long and how insidiously he 
has trifled with my claims upon him, from the time when 
he assured Barton I was a bankrupt, and denied to him 
my possessing any legal claims upon Alston or himself; 
while, at the distance of fifteen hundred miles, he was 
writing most affectionately to me until the last interview 
I have this day had with him, in which he treated me 
not as a faithful associate, ruined by my past connection 
with him, but rather as an importunate creditor invading 
his leisure or his purse with a questionable account. The 
time therefore has fully arrived, at which I should deter 
mine whether I should attempt to secure upward of 
$7,000 for my family, or sacrifice it to an absurd and am 
phibious character of an associate and confidant in his 
views to future projects, without principle or object, and 
destitute of all means to promote them. Under these 
reflections, patience now became exhausted, and to pro- 



OLD SCORES. 505 

crastinate any longer now appeared treason to my family. 
I therefore set seriously about the task I had allotted 
myself for this morning. I found him alone, and had 
not been ten minutes with him, after he had discharged 
a shop-boy, with whom he had been trifling, I know 
not how long, about some article of dress, before he asked 
me if I had heard of Mr. Luckett's treatment of him? 
On my answering in the negative, he informed me that 
Luckett had sent a marshal to him yesterday, and obliged 
him to give bail to the amount of about $16,000, Luck 
ett's claim, I suppose, being about half that sum. This 
intelligence mortified me, as it convinced me I had lost 
time. I expressed my concern for this new embarrass 
ment he had experienced, as it might narrow his means 
to satisfy other claims which he did not consider ques 
tionable, like Luckett's. He asked me upon this, what 
claims I alluded to ? I said it was with great regret I 
should mention my own; namely, the amount of the 
account I had furnished him with in Richmond, and my 
claim for his protested draft held by Miller, with my in 
dorsement for $4,000, on account of which my property 
on the Ohio had been sacrificed to four times the amount. 
Now, had you seen how " that eye of his did from its 
lustre fly," you would have beheld a little man indeed. 
He was dumb and motionless ; but he soon recovered his 
accustomed affectation, and asked, what was the amount 
of my account, declaring he had never looked into it 
since I had handed him it. I said it was a small one, ob 
viously meaning by comparison with most others he had 
settled or secured. "A pretty small one," he replied, 



506 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

" of only about $3,000 ; " and said, he had not yet ex 
amined it. This sneer, at the amount of my account, 
and the questioning of its fairness, by referring it to ex 
amination, which he falsely said he had not given it ; for 
he looked it over the evening I presented it at Richmond, 
asked a question or two on some of the items, which I 
answered, informing him I had vouchers for most of 
them, which he said he did not want to see, and was 
satisfied it was correct ; such a diminution of that suav 
ity of address, with which he had already too often 
diverted me from my purpose, now exhibited him a heart 
less swindler in the last swoon of his disorder, and de 
termined me to hasten my departure. I suppose I testified 
my feelings sufficiently by my looks and manner, with 
out removing his doubts of the impression this treatment 
made upon me, by now telling him, as I did, that my 
time and expectations were exhausted, and I should stay 
in Philadelphia no longer; that I perceived he could 
give me no hopes of money, which I did not expect, but 
that, though I was contented to starve myself, I must 
secure something for my family, since I knew he had 
found means in that way to accommodate every other 
creditor, which was all that detained me in town. He 
now pretended he had nobody he could call upon. I 
observed, I thought it very possible he might never 
return from Europe, in which case my family must have 
a security to resort to in this country. To this remark 
he had the kindness to reply, "that when I said my 
family, I meant myself, and that I knew all his friends." 
"You do," said he, "'Mr. Blennahassett " so he has 



A CRISIS. 507 

frequently pronounced my name before, when he has got 
beyond self-management. "Sir," said I, "I must insist 
upon it, I do not know all your friends." Upon this 
contradiction, he begged my pardon, and said he really 
thought he had informed me of all who were his friends 
in that city.

CHAPTER XIV. 

WASHINGTON CITY, Oct. 29th, 1807. 

MY DEAR WIFE : To-morrow I set out from here for 
Baltimore, in company with Luther Martin, who has 
pledged himself to attend, on the part of Col. Burr and 
myself, at the Circuit Court of the United States, to sit at 
Chillicothe, on the 4th of January next, whether we shall 
personally appear or not, to see that all matters respect 
ing us are properly conducted. It is probable I shall not 
regard a non-compliance on the part of Government with, 
not a request, but a desire, I have expressed through Rod 
ney, the United States Attorney General, that they would 
dispense with my personal appearance until the ensuing 
term in September, through my wishes, in the mean 
time, to revisit my family and attend to my private af 
fairs ; for the proceedings that should necessarily precede 
a forfeiture of the recognizance I have entered into can 
not be gone through before January, 1809. The courts 
of the United States sitting in Ohio only twice a year, 
namely, in the months of January and September, Hard 
ing can explain to you how two writs of scire facias must 
be returned, in case of my absence from the district, 
before my recognizance becomes forfeited. So that my 
present plan is to push for Natchez, about the middle of 
November, in company with Doctor Conimins, by way of 



MARITAL SOLICITUDE. 509 

the Ohio. Government, while they smart under the mor 
tification arising from the issue of the proceedings at 
Richmond, seem determined to pursue Burr and myself 
until we cry mercy ; but the world shall first cry shame ! 
This evening I shall receive Rodney's answer to my let 
ter, probably negativing my demand, but that will not 
affect my movements. My affairs will detain me about 
ten days in Philadelphia, after a stay of two in Baltimore. 
I have strong expectations of putting my claims upon 
Burr and Alston on a desirable footing. 

As to news, you may inform those most interested, par 
ticularly our esteemed friend Mr. Hunt, there will be no 
war w,ith Britain, much less with Spain. This conclusion 
is not drawn merely from the President's message to Con 
gress, but from better authority. Electioneering, secretly, 
is very active here on the part of Madison, Clinton and 
Monroe, for th e exclusion of Jefferson from the next Pres 
idency, while the efforts of others to obtain the Vice 
Presidency, establish a schism in the present party in pow 
er which exhibits a warning type of the future destinies of 
this country. Tyler left this for Baltimore, this morning. 
I shall see him there and learn the manner in which he 
has obtained his discharge, which has been given him 
only verbally, by Rodney. Duane, I expect, will soon 
take a decided part against Jefferson, because he has not 
been less awkward in tampering with letters that have 
passed through his hands. 

I hope you will keep up a rational confidence in my 
resources to preserve my health and spirits ; and I beseech 
you to seek continually the utmost variety and change of 
scene, which I so well know the happy effects of upon 



510 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

you, as the only means of restoring you to my eyes in the 
state I beseech God to grant I may find you. 

Luther Martin is certainly one of the most benevolent 
men alive. His heart is overflowing with the milk of 
philanthropy, which his potations may sometimes coagu 
late, but will never acidify. 

Kiss my boys for me. Your sickness has diverted my 
reflections from them of late ; but our preserving Provi 
dence will restore us in its own time according to our 
merits. H. B. 



BALTIMORE, Tuesday, Nov. 3d, 1807. 

Col. Burr set off to-day at 1 o'clock, P. M., in the mail, 
for Philadelphia, with S. Swartwout, as he had no par 
ticular desire to behold a representation of his execution. 
I was a little more curious ; and, notwithstanding hand 
bills were this morning scattered through the town, pur 
porting that the execution of Judge Marshall, A. Burr, 
Luther Martin and myself would take place at Gallows 
Hill, at 3 o'clock this evening, I both dined and supped at 
the public table, with very large companies, here at 
Evans's, and am, after all, hearty and in good spirits. 
The mob was made up from the Point, but pledged their 
honor, which they did not violate, that they would hurt 
no person. They were followed by two troops of horse 
through the streets, to see they did their business orderly. 
All have dispersed at least three hours ago, it being now 
11, P. M. 

I start to-morrow for Philadelphia, where I am sure 
I shall not receive such public honors. I tire you with 



IN BALTIMORE. 511 

too many letters ; but it is to prevent your paying any at 
tention to the newspapers. I expect Doctor Commins and 
myself will travel together to Natchez. I pray God this 
may find you and the boys well. This is the only care 
that occupies 

Your husband, HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 



BALTIMORE, Nov. 14^, 1807. 

DEAR SIR : Your favor of the 8th inst. I have received, 
and thank you for the friendly and affectionate sentiments 
you have expressed for me. Should you return by this 
place, you will certainly see me. I shall, I flatter myself, 
occasionally hear from you, should you leave Philadelphia 
by a different route. I have written to Baldwin and Bur- 
net, and have inclosed for Judge Todd an open letter, 
under cover, to Col. Burr. I certainly should wish to 
avoid a journey to Chillicothe at so severe a season of the 
year, if thought unnecessary. Whether witnesses will at 
tend against Col. Burr or yourself, is uncertain. "Whether 
bills will be found, is more uncertain ; and it is impossible 
that trials should take place at next term, even should 
bills be found. Under these circumstances, the presence 
of neither of us ought to be necessary. We are once more 
at peace ; I mean in the city of Baltimore. The conduct 
of the mob is most unmercifully condemned and dis 
cussed ; and the leaders are, in truth, though they keep 
up the best appearances they can, heartily ashamed of 
themselves. Dr. Commins leaves me to-day, by the 
water-stage. I direct this to his care, lest you should 
have left Philadelphia. Though I shall ever feel pleased 



512 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

in having been introduced to your acquaintance, yet I 
must regret, on your account, the circumstances under 
which that acquaintance hath been formed. You will 
introduce me, though not personally, yet with my best 
regards, to your lady and your little ones; to hear of 
their and your happiness will increase mine. 

I am, my dear Sir, with great sincerity, your friend 
and obedient servant, 

LUTHER MARTIN. 
H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



To Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 11th, 1807. 

MY DEAR WIFE : As I expected when I wrote last 
from Baltimore, this day fortnight, I have found my 
reception in this city easy and undisturbed. I have 
been here a week last Wednesday, having arrived the 
5th inst. I hope .you received that letter to prepare 
you for a just reception of the accounts that must 
reach you by the papers of a rising at Baltimore, of 
which my effigy only was one of the objects. 

I am much teased by various causes of detention here 
which I can not control. The arrangement of my pecu 
niary claims on Col. Burr, and the acquisition of slaves, 
neither of them yet effected, are the principal. It is un 
certain still how soon I can even hope to leave this town. 
Many motives incite me to go round by sea, in a fine ves 
sel, with Bollman and other agreeable passengers, to sail 
about the middle of next week ; for there are reasons why 



DIFFICULT TRAVEL. 513 

I should not even appear at Marietta, though so many de 
mands call thither. But I yet think that will be my 
course. I receive the most friendly attentions from my 
friends, the Lewises, and others. 

To-morrow I dine with Mr. Pollock, a gentleman of 
fortune and great respectability, where Col. Burr has 
taken up his quarters. I wonder you have not yet drawn 
upon J. S. Lewis, for any sum not exceeding $500, 
through Harding. I am at a loss to conceive what you 
have resorted to, particularly as you call upon me, in your 
most welcome letter of 28th September, to direct the dis 
position of about 1,200 you expected to receive on your 
negro speculation. My only wish is that you should 
apply the money to your own occasions, calling to the aid 
of your judgment the advice of that excellent friend 
whom you will one day further discover I have justly 
appreciated. Butler, who is now here, made me very 
unhappy, by telling me he left him very sick, and I sin 
cerely sighed to be at his bedside. 

A large fund of stoicism will be necessary to support 
the want of letters from you till we meet ; for I suppose 
you have, according to directions long since given you, 
ceased to write ; and it would be impossible to instruct 
you how to direct to me, my change of place will be so 
variable. 

We have to-day a heavy fall of snow here, and I fear 
I shall not be able to take water on the Ohio before it 
breaks up. This, with other considerations, lends much 
to determine me upon the voyage by sea to New Orleans. 
But I can not make up my mind until I again see D. 
Commins, whom I hourly expect here from Baltimore, 
83 



514 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

with whom I must endeavor to procure some negroes, or 
by some other means, as I can not think of returning 
without some new ones, or at least our old ones from 
Ohio. 

I live here at the Mansion House Hotel, late Bing- 
ham's, in Third Street, kept by an Englishman in the 
best style I have yet seen in America. My expenses are 
heavier than I wish, on every account, but I have become 
so public a character, any thing tending to shabbiness or 
obscurity would bring discredit upon you, to avoid which 
I know you would prefer a larger share of future sacri 
fices. The company are genteel and numerous, princi 
pally foreigners, and not a Democrat in thirty, the general 
number at the house. 

My silence on your recovery and the health of the boys 
arises from inability to express my joy and thanksgiving 
to God. But I beseech you to seek the utmost change of 
company and occupation. Nothing can better insure my 
hopes of finding you re-established in your constitution ; 
and every day's experience convinces me of the wisdom 
and facility of not only mitigating the ills of life, by 
resolving to contemn their mischief, but even of our 
capability to be happy in spite of them. Without disap 
pointing contrary conclusions you would draw from our 
separation, I could give you many examples, during my 
reverses, since I left you; but you will hereafter find 
them with more satisfaction in my notes. I shall only 
add, that you should never forget that a steady pursuit 
of gaiety will prove the best prescription for the longest 
enjoyment of the summer season, and prepare the largest 
and most serene autumn of life. We have prospects 



LOVE OF STYLE. 515 

already opened to you that beckon us to wealth and 
repose; if they should prove delusive, our piety and 
moderation will insure tranquillity. 

I am much at a loss to know how to buy any thing 
here for you. I shall, however, procure some things. I 
have rigged myself out in consideration of the extrava 
gant prices of things at Natchez ; and have not forgotten 
the boys' shoes, though God knows when they will get 
them, and I can, badly guess the sizes. I could tell you a 
good deal .of what might pass for news with you, but it 
is not worth while, and could not find room here. I 
must not refuse, however, to mention that I have heard 
here young Michael de Courcy is married to a rich lady 
in England, and has a child or two. The Admiral's 
daughter is married to a Captain Dashwood, of the Navy. 
I learned no other particulars of the family. Wilkinson, 
I hear, has taken passage from Baltimore for New Or 
leans, contrary to every expectation I could form, which 
I mention as a circumstance, if true, not quite indifferent 
to my future tranquillity on the Mississippi. 

You forgot to put Kitty Percy's, and your own, hair 
into your letter, with the boys' drawings. The disap 
pointment, I hope, has not arisen from my knowing how 
to prize both. How happy I should feel, hereafter, in the 
pleasure Miss P. might enjoy, and confer upon us, by 
making a trip with us to Europe. Burr has given notice 
to the Marshal. of Virginia, to be prepared with a guard 
of gentlemen at Richmond, to conduct him from thence, 
on the 16th of next month, to Chillicothe ; but some in 
tervention or other, I apprehend, will prevent that jour 
ney. Harding will smile at this ; but let him mourn

over the misery of talents without strength of nerve or 
energy of character, which have only shone to consume 
the fame of the Chief Justice, who has disappointed 
every lawyer and friend he possessed, and may possibly 
fall a sacrifice to the mob government of the day, for 
attempting to stroke, while he should have muzzled, the 

tiger of Democracy. Remind H g continually of my 

attachment; and assure the Scotts, Major Trask, and all 
other friends, of my warm regards. War direct with 
Britain is even yet the dread of the Democrats ; but 
should it happen in six months afterward, down fall Jef 
ferson and company.

To Aaron Burr, Esq. 

MANSION HOUSE, PHIL A., Nov. 28A, 1807. 
SIR : I have reflected, with much concern, on an ob 
servation which fell from you yesterday ; namely, that 
my account was not a small one, and that you had not yet 
examined it. You may recollect, when I presented it to 
you at Richmond, I told you I had vouchers for most of 
the items it contained ; to which I will now add, that I 
can substantiate the whole, whenever it may become nec 
essary ; and, on receiving it from me, you said you were 
satisfied it was correct, and wanted to see no vouchers. 
If I have misunderstood you, on either of these occasions, 
I shall expect to hear from you in the course of this even 
ing, with a statement of your objections, if any, to my 
charges. 



TO HIS WIFE. 517 

The exact amount of my demand, on account of my 
indorsement of the bills upon which I have been sued by 
Miller, I can not immediately ascertain. I believe the 
damages are 10, chargeable with interest, as well as the 
principal, from the time the bill was returned. 

In the close of the late interesting intercourse that has 
so long subsisted between us, you must perceive, sir, I 
feel myself released from the performance of an offer I 
made you of introductory letters to the Lords Elgin, 
Courtenay and Sackville. I feel that I could not solicit 
their attentions to you as my friend ; and I should wish 
to decline doing so on any other grounds. 

I am, sir, with all respect and consideration, your 
obedient servant, HAEMA^ BLENKERHASSETT. 



To Mrs. Blennerhdssett. 

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 30A, 1807. 

MY DEAR WIFE : I have just closed a trunk which, 
with a box, a bundle of coach-harness and a demijohn of 
lamp oil, will leave to-day by the brig Mary, directed to 
you to the care of Lenlow, Turner & Co. In the bottom 
of the trunk you will find two small volumes of my 
notes, intended for no eye at ISTatchez but Harding's and 
your own. You will, therefore, when not in your hands, 
always keep them under lock and key. The ducks are to 
be put upon water, and the pointed end of the magnet 
brought near their beaks to make them approach you ; 
the blunt end will make them recede. Keep the mag 
net from wet, and do n't let it fall.

I 

I hope you will soon safely receive the things I sent 
before me, which I will follow as soon as I can ; but I find 
it impossible to avoid going to Marietta, without irrep 
arable prejudice to our affairs, and I think it better to 
be a month longer away before we meet, than to have to 
leave you again in August, which might probably happen 
if I did not appear in Ohio, where I may prevent the 
finding of other bills against me, or otherwise get rid of 
the criminal proceedings against me altogether. I there 
fore set out at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning, in the Pitts 
burgh coach, and shall not delay to write to you from 
thence or from Marietta. 

As you will observe by my notes, I apprehend I have 
broken with Aaron Burr on a writ, and shall succeed that 
way, since all others have failed to secure a demand upon 
him of $8,000, as you shall better understand hereafter. 

You may depend upon my exertions to get upon the 
water as speedily as the season and my circumstances will 
permit. I shall give charge of the key of the trunk to 
the Captain of the Mary, or Doctor Bollman, who goes 
passenger in her. I have told him he is recommended to 
your polite attention, if he should visit Natchez, as he 
proposes to do ; but beware of the most insidious influ 
ence of his manners and address, as they are irresistible 
by ordinary minds. 

It is already reported in the best circles here, that I 
have become a friend to Jefferson. This is amusing, and 
may be very serviceable. 

I have not time to add more, as the mail is near clos 
ing. Tom. Buller is to travel with me as far as Carlisle. 
From your husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT. 



BURNET AND BALDWIN. 519 

MARIETTA, Dec. 17*A, 7, P. M., 1807. 
DEAR WIFE : I have been here since Tuesday morning, 
and find appearances of every sort infinitely more flatter 
ing than I had expected. Col. Gushing has been up to 
see me, and will not leave me before noon to-morrow. I 

have an opportunity, by the favor of Wilkins, on his 

way to Natchez, of speedily informing you I shall endeavor 
to fly from the declining storm of Jacobin malice in eight 
or ten days, if the waters will favor my escape. But if they 
do not, you may be assured I have nothing to fear at Chil- 
licothe, where I can overawe the miserable speculations 
of the marshal, based upon the profits he expects to make 
of the trials there. .1 have seen all the negroes, except 
Ransom and Clara ; I think they are well disposed to ac 
company me, and I shall get them off, with more or less 
difficulty. I even propose purchasing Daniel, and a fam 
ily of six heads, for $1,400. I look daily for the arrival 
of Commins, whom I have joined in fitting out a boat at 
Pittsburgh. My coming on here without Commins, was 
to dispatch as much of my business in this quarter as I 
could, while his detained him some time above. I have 
only time to add, I have retained Burnet and Baldwin ; 
the former will be a host of law with the decent part of 
the citizens of Ohio ; the latter, a giant of influence with 
the rabble, whom he justly styled his " bloodhounds," and 
has in good training to bait Wilkinson, whenever he gives 
them the scent. God bless you and our dear boys. I hope 
I shall soon embrace you all in health, if Mr. Wilkins was 
not mistaken when he informed me he heard by letter 
from Mr. Elliot, dated in October, you were then well. 
Your husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT.

To Mrs. M. Blennerhassett. 

NINE MILES ABOVE NATCHEZ, 
Sunday, Feb. Sth, 6, P. M. 

To secure the success of the two objects of my present 
journey; namely, the conveyance to you of what pro 
perty I could bring away from the Ohio, and the enjoy 
ment of a few months' repose with you, I have deter 
mined not to yield to the hopes or fears with which I 
have approached you, by leaving my boats until Harding, 
to whom I have written, may advise me to venture my 
appearance on shore. 

Uncertain whether Dr. Shaw or my other enemies are 
yet apprised of my having failed to make my personal 
appearance at Chillicothe, on the 4th of last month, and 
ignorant how far they may speculate upon whatever news 
they may have received from that quarter since that 
period, I am resolved to continue afloat, that I may, at a 
moment's warning, start with my light keel-boat, and be, 
in about four hours, beyond the line, about sixty miles 
below Natchez, whither you can follow with your family 
and effects by my flat-boat, under the care of my friend 
Mr. Weaver, who has traveled with me. 

If this arrangement takes place, I shall want one of 
your black men, in lieu of whom I shall leave a boy; 
and you will also forward to me, or bring with you, 
such letters from Grand Pre*, as can be obtained from 
Minor, Yidal and Mr. Dunbar. 

You may now privately make your way to my boat, 
under the guidance of Mr. Weaver or Honest Moses ;* 

*A family servant. 



DIARY ENDED. 521 

one of whom will deliver you this letter. You must 
not mention my arrival to the boys or servants until I 
see them, or shall have left the shore. 

Heaven grant that I may happily embrace you in 
health and spirits. 

From your husband, HAR. BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. I refer you to Moses for all intelligence you 
may desire upon small matters. 



Thus, after the close of this memorable trial, which 
had occupied the public attention for several months, 
Blennerhassett returned to Natchez. The continued 
anxiety attendant on a tedious investigation of the charge 
of treason, in which character and life were involved; 
the accumulation of debts ; the neglect of domestic inter 
ests, and the rapid decline of his resources, were discour 
agements, indeed, under which stouter hearts might well 
have sunk without the charge of effeminacy. 

The creditors, who had advanced funds upon his obli 
gations, finding his pecuniary affairs becoming daily more 
embarrassed, were insolent and exacting. Liquidation 
was demanded ; and, when they saw that he neither had 
the funds to meet them, nor the ability to procure further 
credit, they pursued him with the precepts of the law, 
with a rapacity equaled only by their uncharitable invec 
tives. A portion of his library and philosophical appa 
ratus, which had been his amusement in prosperity, and 
the solace of his darker hours ; the remaining furniture 
possessing value to him, wholly unappreciated by others, 
were attached and sold at a criminal sacrifice. 



522 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

His beautiful mansion, together with its surrounding 
shrubbery, had been regarded and used as public prop 
erty. Its fair gardens had been destroyed, not less by the 
hands of the ruthless freebooter than the negligence of 
his tenants and the floods of the Ohio. Not satisfied 
with that which might be removed without injury to the 
freehold, the window-casings were torn out, to procure 
the leaden weights by which the sashes were raised. 
Even the beautiful stone roller, used for leveling his 
grounds, was crushed to pieces, to obtain the iron axles 
on which it ran. The island itself was extended, by a 
writ of elegit 9 at the suit of Robert Miller, of Kentucky, 
who commenced the culture of hemp, and the manufac 
turing of cordage. 

Such is but the every-day lesson of human experience ! 
Such is the sympathy of unfeeling man with the misfor 
tune and distress of his fellow man ! To-day he kneels 
at the shrine of friendship, as the bestial Caliban at the 
feet of Stephano, and calls the object of its worship, 
"god;" to-morrow shrinks cowardly from it, and returns 
his gratitude in foul misdeeds and wanton injuries. 

Cotton, at that time, commanded an exorbitant price. 
Investments in lands adapted to its culture, and slaves to 
work it, afforded rich returns for the amount of capital 
employed. Many were turning their attention to it. 
Blennerhassett conceived it a favorable mode of retriev 
ing his shattered fortune. He therefore concluded a pur 
chase of a thousand acres of land, in Claiborne county, 
at St. Catherine's, near Gibsonport, Mississippi, and 
placed upon it a small number of slaves. Here, again, 
after the varied incidents of two long years, in which he 



AT HOME AGAIN! 523 

had been buffeted about, by the whirlwind of uncourted 
excitement, he found a HOME. 

Those accustomed to battle with the vicissitudes of for 
tune but struggle the greater when encountered by oppos 
ing difficulties. On the contrary, those cradled in the lap 
of ease, are but poorly prepared to meet adversity, unless 
endowed with unusual perseverance. This latter quality 
it was not Blennerhassett's fortune to possess. Accus 
tomed not only to the comforts but the elegancies of life, 
he was a stranger to want. His sleep had never been 
disturbed by visions of distress ; nor his energies excited 
through cupidity or avarice. It may well be imagined, 
therefore, that he was but slightly qualified to sustain 
himself, under his present embarrassments. For him, 
life had but few attractions, save those that were found 
in the pursuits of science ; and to deprive him of these, 
was to deprive him of the happiness of existence. 

With a full appreciation of her husband's feelings, Mrs. 
Blennerhassett undertook to aid him in the management 
of his farm. At the early dawn, she mounted her horse, 
to convey to the overseer the instructions committed to 
her charge. In this, however, she never neglected the 
affairs of her household, or those affectionate attentions 
to her family, which render the felicities of home bright 
to the recollection of husband and child, when the mem 
ory of all else has perished. 

Devereux to Blennerhassett. 

LONDON, Sept. *lih, 1808. 

MY DEAR AND RESPECTED SIR : This makes my second 
letter to you since my arrival in this country. In my for- 



524 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

mer, I acknowledged with gratitude and thanks the re 
ceipt of your dear and most welcome letter from Rich 
mond. What trials, what misfortunes, have you not un 
dergone, and your dear and worthy Mrs. Blennerhassett 
too ! But, my friend, though great your misfortunes, 
what are they when compared to those which the gener 
ous and ill-fated Barry family have lately undergone ? I 
am really so overwhelmed with grief at the sad tidings I 
have had within these few days of that family, that I can 
scarcely arrange my thoughts so as to be understood. 
Only think of it, that poor Mrs. Barry, after the demise 
of her beloved husband in New York, hastened with her 
only remaining daughter to Madeira, in hopes of preserv 
ing her existence by a change of climate ; but, alas ! it 
was too late : she died soon after her arrival there ; and 
her poor mother, broken-hearted, is now left the last of 
her family. This melancholy and deplorable event has 
awakened all my woes. My dear friend, what is this life, 
after all ? 

From the trying afflictions you and your worthy Mrs. 
Blennerhassett have so lately experienced, I should not 
thus obtrude my griefs upon you. But they are griefs pro 
duced by the sufferings of one of the best of families, and 
who, with yours, most attract my regards of any in this 
world. Enough of this painful subject too painful to 
dwell upon. 

As I mentioned to you in my last letter, I perfectly 
agree with you in the sentiments you expressed to me 
from Richmond, and which I have long felt, I assure you. 
Yes, my friend, from what is past, and from what is gone, 
never to be recalled again, I could most willingly estrange 



525 

myself from this world to share a little content with you 
in any corner or in any obscurity. 

I have already mentioned to you that I failed in my 
application to this government. They will not even per 
mit me to visit my native country. I, knowing the cause, 
am not surprised at it; for you must know they inter 
cepted one of O'Connor's letters to me, about three years 
ago, in which he offered me a nattering rank to enter the 
French service with him. This offer, though made to aid 
misfortune more than rebellion, has operated very seri 
ously against me ; and, was it not for the precaution I took 
previous to my leaving the United States, I might now be 
immured in the Tower. But, my dear friend, the disap 
pointment does not now affect me; for, truly, I never 
cared so little as to independence in money matters as 
I do at this moment. 

Without adverting to the cause of my inquiry, I asked 
two or three gentlemen from about Cork as to the per 
sons you have named, but could gain no satisfactory in 
telligence. Had I been permitted to have gone to Ire 
land, I should have gone every length in tracing that 
subject. As I feel extremely anxious to hear from you, 
and of your estimable lady and children, I entreat you to 
write me as speedily as possible of your future plans, and 
where we are yet to meet. 

As I can not express to you, my dearest friend, what I 
feel, I shall end this scrawl with best wishes and regards 
to you, dear Mrs. Blennerhassett, and my young friend 
Dominick. 

Your most truly attached and distressed friend, 

J. DEVEREUX. 



526 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

P. S. I do 'nt mean to return to the United States 
immediately. There is no prospect I should think of 
the embargo's being very soon raised, unless for a more 
active scene of operation; and, of course, if so, there 
could he nothing to engage my attention particularly 
there; and by remaining here, I am more to myself 
from the sight of the world. Hoping that you will not 
omit writing to me by the first opportunity, I am, again, 
Yours, most sincerely, J. D. 

A remittance of 300 from Ireland, being a balance 
from Lord Yentry, on the sales of his estates, enabled 
Blennerhassett to start afresh in his new field of enter 
prise. The business correspondence between himself and 
his consignee, Joseph S. Lewis, of Philadelphia, is vo 
luminous, and of but little interest to the general reader, 
further than showing his efforts were not altogether in 
effectual. A few of these only, together with one or two 
letters from his old friends, are here inserted : 



Joseph S. Lewis to JBlennerhassett. 

PHILADELPHIA, July, 1809. 

MY DEAR SIR: On Saturday, I received from Mr. 
Harding your esteemed letter of the 9th of June, ac 
quainting me with your having consigned your son 
Dominick to me. I accept this trust with pleasure, ac 
companied, at the same time, with great anxiety; and 
you may assure yourself my care of him shall only be 
second to that of my own children. 

Mr. Harding will inform you that the Board of Health 



ADOPTION. 527 

will not permit him to come into the city before the 4th 
of August, although every one on board the ship was in 
good health, and that, therefore, they have stopped at 
Darby, about seven miles from town, where I have been 
twice to see them, and, yesterday, took Mrs. Lewis with 
me, who feels all a mother's anxious care, and enters into 
Mrs. Blennerhassett's feelings on parting with so beloved 
an object as a son. I have the pleasure to say that I 
have procured a situation for Dominick, such as I think 
you would every way approve, if you were here yourself 
one equally removed from the bigotry of a monastic 
education, and the more uncourtly forms of our society. 
The Academy to which I refer was established, about four 
years ago, by a number of our most respectable gentle 
men, for the education of their own children, and is 
conducted by two French gentlemen of the name of 
Out*. 

The situation of the school is high, healthy and pleas 
ant, about four miles north of Philadelphia, a distance 
which will afford me an opportunity of seeing Dominick 
often, and of bringing him home occasionally to spend a 
holiday. Mr. Harding being obliged to leave this morn 
ing for New York, Dominick has been placed under the 
charge of a respectable old lady, where I shall see him 
every day or two until his quarantine is out ; after which 
I shall bring him home, and, as soon as every thing is 
prepared, place him with Messrs. Carre*, who are men of 
amiable and respectable character, sufficiently rigid to 
keep their boys within a correct line. Present my best 
regards to Mrs. Blennerhassett, and also those of Mrs. 
L. ; tell her to dissipate all anxiety about her son. that 



528 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Mrs. L. will take upon herself a mother's care, and that 
my affection for his parents will insure my attention to 
his comforts, to his wants, and to his well-doing. * * * 

Yours, with great esteem, J. S. LEWIS. 

H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



From Thomas Addis Emmett. 



YORK, Sept. 15^, 1809. 

MY DEAR BLENNERHASSETT : It was not without con 
siderable emotion and pleasure that I received yours a 
few days since by Mr. Harding, and heard from him the 
first news I had been able, authentically, to collect of 
your present situation. Of what is past, it is not fit I 
should say any thing in a communication of this kind ; 
of the future, you will believe me perfectly sincere, when 
I assure you that your prosperity and happiness will 
always interest me very strongly. In return for the 
pleasing intelligence I have had of you, accept similar 
accounts of me and my family. My success has been 
greater than I could have calculated upon. My health 
has been extremely good, and Mrs. Emmett and the 
children enjoy the prosperity which has succeeded to our 
trials ; such, I trust, will also be the event of your present 
situation. Mr. Harding mentioned to me that he had 
brought along with him your oldest son, Dominick, and 
placed him at an Academy at Germantown, Pennsylvania. 

As Mrs. Blennerhassett has brought her mind to part 
with him, a thought struck me, which I now lay before 
you. I have three sons at school at Flatbush, Long 



FROM FRIENDS. 529 

Island, five miles from this city, under the care of a Mr. 
Thompson, who is very competent, a graduate of Trinity 
College,' Dublin, and of very unexceptionable character ; 
his wife is a Mary Anne Connell, cousin to Maurice Con- 
nell, of Iveragh ; came over here a widow, of the name 
of Yielding, with strong letters from Kerry friends to 
Mrs. Emmett, and was married in my house to Mr. 
Thompson. I have mentioned your son to them both, 
and can answer that he would be treated with more than 
common affection and care ; and, being at the same school 
with my own, I should have opportunities of showing 
him, perhaps, some attention, which, situated where he 
is, would be out of my power. I am not fond of sup 
planting a person like his present master, who, I presume, 
would discharge his duty, but I submit the proposition to 
your consideration. 

Adieu, my dear Blennerhassett. Do you and Mrs. B. 
receive the best wishes of me and my family for every 
thing that concerns you, and believe me sincerely 
Yours. THOS. ADDIS EMMETT. 



From, Joseph S. Lewis. 

PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 22d> 1810. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : About ten days ago I received your 
esteemed letter of 8th August, and I enter with much 
warmth into your situation and the means proposed for 
improving it. I have been engaged, in my mind, since 
its receipt, to contrive some way of meeting your desire 
of obtaining the sum you want to borrow, but I do not 

find any one here who is willing to lend money on such 
34 



530 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

distant security ; and even the offer of more than usual 
interest would serve to introduce in the mind of strangers 
a doubt of the goodness of the security ; and there are 
none of our money-lenders who would be willing to take 
the chance of being compelled to go to Ohio or the Mis 
sissippi Territory, to look after his payment. I propose, 
then, that after the sale of your cotton, which we hourly 
expect from New Orleans, you should draw, in addition 
to what our advance may then be, as much as will make 
$5,000, which you shall have at six per cent, interest per 
annum. You are to consign to us all your cotton for 
sale, on which we shall charge the usual commission 
of five per cent. * * * 

Very respectfully your friend, ' * J. S. LEWIS. 



From the Same. 

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 17*A, 1810. 

MY DEAR FRIEND: Your favor of 14th November I 
received yesterday, and am much pleased to learn the 
happy effect of my last letter upon your uneasiness about 
Dominick, whom I have not seen for a few weeks, but 
I hear from him frequently ; and, a few days ago, I saw 
Mr. Carre*, who said he was well, and spoke favorably 
of an increased attention to his studies. There is no 
doubt you can obtain excellent lodgings in the neigh 
borhood of the city, at a moderate rate, say five or six 
dollars a week each, for Mrs. Blennerhassett and yourself, 
including board. I suppose your passages would cost 
$100 each ; about half that for your son, and the same 



COTTON TRADE. 531 

rate for your servants. I should think $1,100 or $1,200 
would be an ample allowance for your expenses for a trip 
of five or six months, bating the temptations such a large 
shop as our city would afford you to lay out money for 
luxuries, etc., which, of course, your own prudence would, 
in some measure, guard you against. On the score of 
health the jaunt would be desirable, and I shall be glad 
you make use of any excuse to give Mrs. Lewis and 
myself the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs. Blenner- 
hassett. 

Very respectfully your friend, J. S. LEWIS. 



From the Same. 

January 6, 1811. 

I can not conceive any reason why the New York mar 
ket should offer a better price for cotton than ours. It is 
not quite so steady, and the people are more speculative. 
If your cotton goes there to our correspondent, we must 
pay his commission, and we should not be quite so well 
satisfied of the solidity of the persons to whom sale 
would generally be made as here. 

Your cotton has arrived, but I can not at present effect 
a sale on such terms as I like. The gloomy prospect of 
our affairs with England is such, that we do not consider 
a speculation in cotton as safe, and its value here will also 
be much affected by the proceedings of Congress regard 
ing the Bank of the United States. If the charter should 
not be renewed, and there seems much doubt of it, prices 
of every article will fall very materially. In addition to 
this, the situation of exchange is such, that bills can no A 



532 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

be drawn on London without the utmost difficulty, and 
then at a loss of seven or eight per cent. 

The proceeds of your cotton now on hand, and for 
which at present there is no sale, we estimate at $2,000. 
Yours very respectfully, J. S. LEWIS. 

In viewing the complacency with which Blennerhas- 
sett had heretofore regarded Burr's actions toward him 
self, we are at a loss whether to attribute his silence to 
the mildness of his temper, or a lack of courage to vin 
dicate his honor from the aspersions of his enemies. 
But, for his unfortunate alliance with Burr, he might still 
have reposed in the shady groves of the isle. But for 
Burr, he might have continued to enjoy those peaceful 
pursuits for which he had abandoned Castle Conway, to 
secure a home in the secluded forests of America; but 
for him, he might yet have enjoyed a competency beyond 
his wants, and luxuriated in the fields of literature, with 
out the fear of pecuniary distress. 

It was not, however, until driven to it by necessity, that 
Blennerhassett attempted to show how much he had 
really been injured by the man whom he had regarded 
and cherished as his friend ; but who had now deserted 
him in the hour of misfortune. Almost bankrupt in 
purse, with a large family dependent upon him for sup 
port, to whom could he look for indemnity for the losses 
sustained in the enterprise of Burr? He had contributed 
largely, if not entirely, to the procuring of boats, imple 
ments and provisions for the expedition, and, as yet, had 
received nothing in return. Both Burr and Alston had 
turned a deaf ear to his petitions for relief; indeed, Burr, 



LETTER TO ALSTON. 533 

had it been his desire, could afford but poor satisfaction 
from the meager remains of a once large fortune. Blen- 
nerhassett, accordingly, addressed the following letter to 
Governor Alston : 

Blennerhassett to Gov. Alston. 

LA CACHE, PORT GIBSON, Miss. TER., 

March 2d, 1811. 

SIR : As a letter from me, after so long a suspension 
of our correspondence, will probably be as little welcome 
as expected, I anticipate, on inditing it, only such atten 
tion on your part to its object as your reflections may 
deem consonant to your interest. I proceed accordingly, 
without further preamble, to apprise you, that having 
long since despaired of all indemnity from Mr. Burr for 
my losses, by the confederacy in which I was associated 
with you and him, I count upon a partial reimbursement 
from you upon grounds and motives which it is the ob 
ject of this letter to develop and recall to your recollec 
tion. Having mentioned Mr. Burr, I wish you, sir, to 
observe, that I shall never more consider a reference to 
his honor, good faith, or resources in any other light than 
as a scandal to any man offering it who is not already 
sunk as low as himself. You w^ill therefore feel, I hope, 
as little disposed to speak, at this day, of his intentions 
as of his means to indemnify his friends. It is on you, 
sir, that as regards myself, devolves this duty. The 
heroic offer you made to co-operate with your person and 
fortune in our common enterprise, gave you, in my esti 
mation, a color of claim to that succession in empire you 
boasted you would win by better titles your deeds of 



534 * THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

merit in council or the field. For examples of these 
exploits, I anxiously invoked the season of their achieve 
ment; but I confess, sir, I attached a more interesting 
value to the tender you so nobly pledged of your whole 
property to forward and support our expedition, together 
with your special assurances to me of reimbursement for 
all contingent losses of a pecuniary nature I might indi 
vidually suffer. These considerations, sir, as they in 
volved me on your responsibility, naturally refer me to 
you for the acquittal of it, and possessing such ample 
powers to discharge it, I flatter myself I shall be able to 
induce you to the full exercise of them. To this end I 
now apprise you, that the period has arrived in which I 
feel myself warranted to tell you, that in virtue of your 
oral and written assurances to guarantee me against all 
injuries to my property by reason of my participation 
in the confederacy of 1806, I finally determined to em 
bark with you, and have thereby sustained damage to the 
amount of $50,000, of which sum I now demand $15,000, 
payable at New Orleans or Philadelphia, in August next. 
The respective sums you have paid already in part dis 
charge of your written obligation, I believe, $12,500, 
together with the $15,000 now required, will leave a 
balance of $22,500, which you may, if you please, adjust 
by your obligation, on receipt of which, if required, I 
will dismiss my demand against Mr. Burr by suit in 
Philadelphia. 

Here, sir, you perceive is a demand instituted on the 
guarantee of the good faith of a gentleman, who can 
never plead specially thereto but out of a court of honor. 
Within that jurisdiction, he must acquiesce or rely on the 



REMEMBRANCERS. 535 

general issue. Your adjusting this affair in the manner 
proposed, I would, at a certain period of our acquaint 
ance, have suffered no man to question ; but the cruel, 
cold-blooded indifference with which you have so many 
years beheld a distressed family, in vain endeavoring to 
collect some fragment of the property embarked and 
wrecked in the voyage you had insured, without acquit 
ting the debt of your guarantee such a demeanor, sir, 
naturally obliges me, as a further and final result of all 
my labors and deliberations that relate to you to submit 
to your reflections, other motives of action besides those 
already offered. These are certainly of a character and 
complexion I regret it should be my lot to exhibit to the 
public. To you, however, it belongs to say whether they 
shall remain shrouded within the sanctuary of your 
own breast, or stalk forth the heralds of the private trea 
son and public perjury they will proclaim infallibly to the 
honest Democratic electors of South Carolina, who would 
thence remove you from the chair of their assembly with 
a different kind of zeal from that through which they 
placed you in it. Yes, sir, I submit it to your discretion, 
to keep concealed from your friends and from your coun 
try that led you to take part in our confederacy, which 
you pledged yourself to me to back with all your prop 
erty, worth, as you stated, 200,000 guineas, to join and 
support us at !N~ew Orleans, at the head of 2,000 to 
3,000 men, to leave with me, besides your oral and writ 
ten guarantee of indemnity for all my losses, a private 
cipher, the inscrutable vehicle of our correspondence ; 
afterward, to commit the shabby treason of deserting from 
your parent by affinity, and your sovereign in expectancy ; 



536 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPE11S. 

and then, finally, in your -letters to your Governor, to 
vilify your father-in-law, and perpetrate an open perjury 
by publicly denying all privity or connection with his 
views or projects. Assuredly, sir, a picture of this kind, 
on which I have occasionally worked during the last four 
years, can not, you must imagine, be viewed by your 
Democratic friends with less horror than a death's head 
in a phantasmagoria ; and yet, after all my labors, I feel 
no wish to exhibit it to vindicate my character in associ 
ating with Mr. Burr and yourself in the judgment of the 
mobility of the low people, or to appease the impotent 
vindictiveness of Mr. Jefferson and his miserable parti 
sans. The fact is, I have survived all the labors of body 
and mind imposed upon me by the evil genius of Jeffer 
son and of Burr, except the remaining one of exposing 
both. 

But I must bequeath to my children and friends a 
memorial of that honor, loyalty and courage, to which 
you and I made our first offerings on entering into the 
association, but which you did not follow with me in 
the expedition ; such a remembrance, containing sketches 
of Mr. Burr's cabinet and correspondence with myself 
and other associates ; the history of my interviews and 
consultations with Mr. Alston, relative to Mr. Burr's 
designs upon "New Orleans and Mexico, with ample 
references to letters and other rare and original docu 
ments, that will be lodged in Charleston or Philadelphia, 
for the inspection of the curious, the whole, sir, is now 
ready for the press, but shall not be sent away for pub 
lication until you shall have failed to announce your com 
pliance with the engagements of honor herein required

of you, by forwarding a credit for $15,000, payable as 
before mentioned, and accompanied with your obligation, 
or some other equivalent proposal, for adjusting the 
balance. Now, sir, to conclude, you may gather from 
what you have read, that I hold myself bound by no 
obligations of secrecy to any one who has broken faith 
with me, provided the disclosure work no injury to an 
innocent third person. That you may have full notice, I 
have no objection, in apprising you of the nature and 
design of the proposed publication ; but to give you an 
opportunity of keeping it out of view, by discharging 
the debt of honor you have contracted, whereby, in doing 
an act of justice, you will prevent the necessity of my 
selling to the public that detail of infamy and falsehood 
which you should exclusively purchase; that your past 
experience of my principles and temper will guarantee 
the sincerity of these sentiments, and to exemplify this 
assurance, I promise you, that whether the demand I have 
made upon you be complied with or not, I will, at any 
time after publishing my book, which shall be suppressed 
or expedited by your determination, promptly attend to 
any call you may think proper to make upon me. 

I have to add, that I have no doubt of my book's 
producing $10,000, if you do not think proper to prevent 
its appearance. Should you decide in the negative, you 
may rest assured I shall not, to save the trouble of smelt 
ing, abandon the ore I have extracted, with such expense 
of time and labor from the mines, both dark and deep, 
not, indeed, of Mexico, but of Alston, Jefferson and Burr. 
I send, besides the original, a duplicate and triplicate of 
this letter; namely, one directed to Columbia, one to 



538 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Charleston, and the third to Georgetown. This is done 
with a view, by lessening the chances of my letters' mis 
carrying, to expedite your answer, for which I shall wait 
double the time necessary to bring it to me in the regular 
course of the mails. 

I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 
COL. J. ALSTON. 

The success of his new undertaking animated Blenner- 
hassett in the hope of reclaiming his losses in a very 
short time. Such, indeed, would have been the result 
had not the war of 1812, and the embargo which fol 
lowed, put a decided check to our commercial transac 
tions. Produce, of every description, immediately fell in 
price, until the commodity would scarce pay the expenses 
of marketing. A bare subsistence, therefore, was all he 
could promise himself, until a termination of hostilities 
between the contending nations. 

But misfortunes seldom come singly. It was but a 
short time previous that he had heard of the fate of his 
island residence, rented by him to one of his Belpre* 
friends, but who was afterward dispossessed by the Ken 
tucky creditor. As the beauty of the grounds had been 
entirely destroyed, and the mansion itself much injured, 
through carelessness and neglect, it had lost its primitive 
attractions, and was now regarded as a mere convenience 
in farming. In the year 1811, the tenant raised an un 
usual quantity of hemp, which was stored in one of the 
wings of the building. On a very cold night, several of 
the slaves, who had been permitted to visit their Virginia 



KINDNESS. 539 

friends, overturned the boat in which they were return 
ing, and one of their number was drowned. Suffering 
under intense cold, they proceeded to the cellar where 
the spirituous liquors were kept, to obtain the stimulus 
for counteracting the ill effects of their accident. Pass 
ing through the entrance of the hemp-room, to which 
the stairway led, by accident they communicated the 
flame of the candle to the hemp, and, in a few moments, 
the destroying element was beyond their control. Stupid 
with astonishment, at the awfulness of the spectacle in 
the darkness of the night, they neglected to apprise the 
inmates, who would all doubtless have perished, had not 
some one of them fortunately awakened in time to give 
the alarm. Escaping, with nothing but their night- 
clothes and a few articles of furniture, they beheld with 
awe this beautiful mansion, which, but a few years previ 
ous, had been the abode of peace and happiness, adorned 
with all that could embellish or beautify its appearance, 
rapidly reduced to a mass of ruins. 



From Joseph S. Lewis. 

PHILADELPHIA, March 26th, 1811. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor of 27th ult. has just reached 
me, and it affords me much pleasure in hearing from you. 
It would be very gratifying if it were oftener. I regret 
extremely that you should be thrown back by want of a 
sufficient capital to work your estate to the best advan 
tage, and I should be extremely happy in offering you an 
increase of the credit sometime ago granted you ; but 



540 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

even that credit is very inconvenient, in consequence of 
the uncommon situation of the times. Owing to the 
charter of the United States Bank having expired, and 
the severance of our intercourse with England, a total 
stagnation of "business has occurred, and we want all our 
means to make ourselves comfortable, when our stores 
are overloaded with goods, etc. Your cotton we have 
not been able to sell a bale of, and our advances for you, 
at this moment, are about $8,000. Under all these cir 
cumstances I can not encourage you to draw any further, 
but certainly I will not dishonor those already drawn, 
and which you have advised as payable at September 'and 
January next, and the one to Capt. Yidal of $700, rely 
ing that you will, as early as possible, send your cotton 
down to our friends at New Orleans, with orders to sell 
it, or send it round here as soon as they can, as we may 
meet some chance of selling it ; and you may be assured, 
that whenever I can do it, I will extend the credit. 

I hope you may succeed in making a sale of your 
Island. I have recently heard from, Mr. Woodbridge, 
who was in town a few days ago, that your house on the 
Island was burned down, and it happened in consequence 
of Miller having stored it with hemp, which took fire 
from a candle taken in by a negro woman. I most 
heartily regret this circumstance, which must injure the 
value of the property ; but I should conceive Miller was 
liable in having done what his lease could not authorize, 
making a storehouse of a dwelling. As to Alston, there 
seems no chance of a recovery from him. 

Your letter for Dominick I will send to him ; he con 
tinues in good health, and is improving in his studies. 



BUSINESS. 541 

Mrs. L. and my family are all well. I hope you will be 
able to make your arrangements in such a way as will 
enable us to see personally that you and Mrs. B. are so 
too. Present my best respects, and believe me ever 
Yours, Jos. S. LEWIS. 



PHILADELPHIA, June 21st, 1811. 

DEAR SIR : Your favors have all been replied to. We 
have not been able to dispose of your cotton, and the 
price is nominally thirteen cents. We see no better pros 
pect for what is to come, and we therefore recommend 
your sending your new crop to Amory Callender, New 
Orleans, with orders to sell it at once, and remit us as 
soon as they can. Our political affairs do not promise 
us much amendment in the article of cotton, and the 
sooner, therefore, it can be turned into money the better. 
Dominick is well, and improves in his studies considera 
bly. Your cotton here is still on hand. 

Jos. S. LEWIS & Co. 

September 7th, 1811. 

We see no prospect of a rise in the cotton, and would 
willingly sell yours at twelve cents, if to be had, for 
there is no use in keeping it. Jos. S. L. 

H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 13th, 1811. 

DEAR SIR : Your esteemed favor of 19th ult., dated at 
Natchez, reached us yesterday, and affords us pleasure to 



542 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

learn that you and your family were recovering from 
your sickness, which has been so generally fatal upon the 
Mississippi this year. On the score of confidence in you, 
we should not decline to accept your bills for any reason 
able sum, in addition to what we are already in advance, 
but these are not times when we can do so without very 
great inconvenience. Business generally is suspended, 
and the usual facilities of procuring money are cut off. 
In fact, two years ago, the advance of $6,000 could not 
have been so inconvenient as $1,000 now. Our advance 
now is about $13,000, and taking into view your cotton 
here, and what we may receive of your next crop, the 
whole will not amount to $3,600, and this will be a long 
time first. Under these circumstances, we have con 
cluded not to accept your last bill of $600 to W. Jackson 
& Co., although the alternative is extremely painful to 
us ; but as there seems a prospect of making sale to Mr. 
Anthony, of your Island, we shall immediately write to 
him, and if it should seem likely the business can be con 
cluded in a reasonable time, we will take care that your 
bill shall not go back. "We have given as a reason for 
non-acceptance, that it is for want of advice. After 
offering your cotton upon every occasion for sale, with 
out effect, and seeing no prospect of a favorable result by 
keeping it longer, we have concluded to ship it to Liver 
pool, and have put it on board the ship United States, 
which being intended for your interest, we have no doubt 
you will approve. With respect to the present crop, we 
recommend you to direct to Messrs. Amory, Callender & 
Co., to make sale of it immediately, and remit at once to 
us, or, if they can not do this, to lose no time in shipping

it to Liverpool, consigned to Messrs. Leigh & Shellock. 
Here, it will not sell for more than at !N"ew Orleans. Our 
brother in New York sold a large parcel last week at 10J 
cents. We see no prospect of an improvement in cotton 
while the continent is shut. England has now two years 
supply on hand, and unless this market is opened to her 
manufactories, cotton will go down. Dominick is in 
excellent health, and very contented with his situation. 
With our best respects to your good lady, and our sincere 
regards for yourself, we remain, 

Your friends, Jos. S. LEWIS & Co. 

From the House of Jos. S. Lewis $ Co. 

December 1st, 1811. 

Agreeably to our annual custom, we wait on you with 
your account to this date, showing a balance in our favor 
of $12,150 T 3 5 (j. We also inclose you, on account of the 
charges on your cotton, which we have shipped by the 
United States, amounting to $909 T y<j, which is included in 
the above balance. We have no reply to our letter to 
Mr. J. C. Anthony, concerning the Island. 

December 31st, 1811. 

Your esteemed lines of 1st instant I received on Sun 
day, and should be very sorry that our private corres 
pondence should be suspended on account of the state of 
our mercantile affairs. It is true, the advance is particu 
larly inconvenient just now, but I hope soon to hear of 
your crop reaching Kew Orleans, and if your correspond 
ent there ship it at once to Liverpool, it may do well, as 



544 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the article has risen by the last accounts, and I hope we 
shipped yours by the United States at a favorable moment. 

Jos. S. LEWIS. 

February 22d, 1812. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : Your few lines of llth ult., accompa 
nying a letter to the house, lies before me. ~No circum 
stance for a long time has given me as much pain as the 
necessity of staying my hand from any further uncovered 
advances to you; but I am satisfied, however distressing 
it may be to you, thai you have correctness of mind suffi 
cient to estimate the true reason, and not feel offended at 
the circumstance. Dominick is well, but has not been in 
town since his Christmas holidays. I trust what the 
House have proposed will meet your object, and afford 
you relief. J. S. LEWIS. 

H. BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 



PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 22d, 1812. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor of llth January has reached 
us only yesterday, and its perusal has caused us some very 
unpleasant feelings, in the reflection of your situation, as 
you now paint it. "We would willingly make any sacri 
fice in reason to help you, but the reasons which induced 
the refusal of your bill still operate, and with our capital 
locked up with you, and more largely in other places, we 

have not the means, without great inconvenience, to ad- 

% 

vance further. The bill of $600 has gone back, and is 
now too late to help it, or we would go that step further ; 
but we will do this : Send your cotton to our friends at 



GOOD ADVICE. 545 

New Orleans, with orders to sell the same, if it will bring 
a price that you think enough, and if it will not, to ship 
it immediately to Messrs. Leigh & Shellock, of Liverpool, 
and you may, on its arrival at New Orleans, draw upon 
us for two-thirds of whatever our friends say would prob 
ably be the net proceeds of the cotton if sold at the cur 
rent price at that time at New Orleans. This, it appears 
to us, will relieve you, and, at the same time, make us a 
small payment on account. Your cotton will probably net 
you 12 cents, which, on 40,000 Ibs., is $4,800, two-thirds 
of which is $3,200, which is about the sum you have 
stated as being wanted by you to meet your debts and 
provide for family expenses. You have never mentioned 
to us what quantity of ground you hold, and the number 
of your negroes which would be a satisfaction to us to 
know, that in case of accident to you, these would be 
something for your family, as well as for us. 

We have corresponded with Mr. J. C. Anthony, and 
prepared to meet him at Washington, to complete the 
contract. We inclose you copies of his letters to us, by 
which you will see you are very wide in your idea of the 
value of the Island; we should think that money is 
worth more to you than any rise in the property will ever 
realize, and if he comes near your mark, should accept 
the offer. 

As to the removal of Dominick, on account of the cost 
of his education, that is quite out of the question, and no 
more need be said on that business. 

It will afford us the highest gratification to learn that 
the plan proposed meets your view, and will answer your 
purpose.

resume that feeling of independence which you so much 
enjoy ; and, in the mean time, we remain, very sincerely, 
Your friends, J. S. LEWIS & Co. 

H. BLENNERHASSETT ESQ. 

"We are informed, by his biographer,* that, after the 
trial at Richmond, Colonel Burr, believing that the polit 
ical situation of Europe afforded opportunities for ac 
complishing the object he had long contemplated, of 
emancipating the Spanish American colonies from the 
degrading tyranny of Spain, conceived the design of 
soliciting the aid of some European government in such 
an undertaking, and that with these views he sailed from 
New York for England on the 7th of June, 1808. 

During the first three months of his residence in Lon 
don, he made various unsuccessful efforts to approach the 
English Government, but there were two obstacles in the 
way, both of which were insuperable. The Spaniards 
were then resisting the invasion of Napoleon ; and 
the enthusiasm of the British nation in favor of the 
Spanish patriots, as well as the policy of the British 
Government, were absolutely opposed to any scheme for 
separating the colonies from Spain. "But, in addition to 
this obstacle," continues his biographer, " Colonel Burr, 
from the moment of his landing in England, was an 
object of suspicion and distrust to the Government." 

He afterward visited Edinburg, where he remained for 
several months; but the suspicions of the Government 



Matthew L. Davis's Memoir of Burr, Vol. II, p. 412 



COOL TREATMENT. 547 

becoming daily more aroused, he was peremptorily or 
dered back to London by Lord Melville. Here he was 
seized, conveyed to Stafford Place prison, and his papers 
searched. After an imprisonment of two days, he was 
set at large, with orders to quit the kingdom ; but, linger 
ing for a few days, he received a more decided mandate 
from Lord Liverpool to leave London on the following 
day, and the kingdom in forty-eight hours. 

In April, 1809, he embarked from Harwich for Gotten- 
burgh. On leaving England, his future movements 
seemed undetermined. He was unwilling, says his biog 
rapher, to renounce the projects which carried him to 
Europe, and all hope from England being ended, he 
looked next for aid to Napoleon, whose policy, from the 
resistance of Spain and the preponderancy of the British 
navy, was now in favor of the independence of the Span 
ish American colonies. He finally resolved to wait in 
Sweden until he received advices from America, and then 
proceed to Paris, to communicate with the Emperor. 
From Sweden he passed through Germany to Paris, vis 
iting Hamburgh, Hanover, Saxe-Gotha, Weimar and 
Frankfort, He arrived in Paris in February, 1810. 
Here he made a long and unsuccessful attempt to obtain 
an audience of the Emperor. He attributed his failure 
to the unfavorable representations of Talleyrand and the 
United States Minister. Several months of neglect and 
inattention, at length, discouraged him, and he resolved 
to return home. But here again an unforeseen difficulty 
presented itself. On applying for a passport to the 
United States, he was informed by the police that he 
could not have one to go out of the empire. After four 



548 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

months' detention, during which time he had exhausted 
his entire means, he addressed a memorial to Napoleon, 
praying permission to return home. This also passed 
without notice. He next addressed notes to Jonathan 
Russell, American charge d'affaires at Paris, and Mr. 
McRae, the American Consul, for a certificate of citizen 
ship. Russell thus harshly replies : " The man who 
evades the offended laws of his country,abandons, for the 
time, the right to their protection. This fugitive from 
justice, during his voluntary exile, has a claim to no 
other passport than one which shall enahle him to sur 
render himself for trial for the offenses with which he 
stands charged ; such a passport will Mr. Russell furnish 
to Mr. Burr, but no other." 

His situation seemed one of almost hopeless despair. 
In his diary of November 25th, 1810, he writes: "Noth 
ing from America, and really I shall starve. Borrowed 
three francs to-day. Four or five little debts keep me 
constantly in alarm altogether, about two Louis." 

" December 1st, 1810. Came in upon me this morning, 
just as I was out of bed, for twenty-seven livres. Paid 
him, which took literally my last sous. "When at Denous, 
thought I might as well go to Pelasgie; set off, but 
recollected I owed the woman who sits in the passage 
two sous for a cigar ; so turned about to pursue my way 
by Pont des Arts, which was within fifty paces ; remem 
bered I had not wherewith to pay the toll, being one 
sous ; had to go all the way round by the Pont Royal, 
more than half a mile." * 



* Davis's Memoirs of Burr, Vol. II, pp. 423-4. 



CORRESPONDENCE. 549 

At length, in July, 1811, a ship being about to sail, in 
ballast, he received permission to return. He arrived at 
Amsterdam in August, and, after a delay of a month, 
embarked for the United States ; but the vessel in which 
he sailed was captured by an English frigate and carried 
into Yarmouth. The Vigilant, for such was its name, 
and the effects of her passengers were taken possession 
of by the Government ; and as Burr had paid for his 
passage, and was reduced in funds, he found it necessary 
to remain for a time in England. Finally, on the 6th of 
March, 1812, he sailed in the ship Aurora, and arrived in 
New York in June, 1812, just four years after his depart 
ure from America. 

Blennerhassett having instituted proceedings against 
him at New Orleans, during his absence, to recover some 
securities which had been pronounced available, and, 
learning of his arrival, addressed him a communication 
upon the subject, when the following correspondence 
occurred : 



YORK, March Sth, 1813. 

SIR : Your letter of the 24th January has been some 
days in my hands, and I have been searching but in vain 
for something to enlighten me as to the nature of the 
action which you would propose to bring against Wilkins, 
etc. No objection, however, occurs to me against making 
the assignment you ask. When you shall inform me of 
the grounds of the proposed suit, if they shall appear to 
me to be well founded, and not calculated to produce a 
reaction on myself, it is probable I may accede to your 



550 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

wishes without delay, not, however, with any reservation 
of an interest as you have proposed. 

I am, sir, your obedient, A. BURR. 



To Aaron Burr.* 

LA CACHE, PORT GIBSON, April 16^A, 1813. 

SIR : Perceiving you seem disposed to assign to me 
your interest in the contract you entered into with Wil- 
kins and Morrison, in 180G, provided "I can enlighten 
you as to the nature of the action I would bring against 
them," I hasten to acquaint you that I should prefer 
suing them directly, in the character of your assignees, 
for the amount of the advance you made to them, in bills 
rendered negotiable by my indorsement, to the contingent 
recovery I might obtain against them as garnishees in a 
suit already instituted at New Orleans. 

Copies of the contract, and of the receipt of "Wilkins 
and Morrison for $15,000, in bills, shall be forwarded to 
you, and if you think proper, without delay, to transmit 
me a properly authenticated assignment of all your 
claims for the above advance, and for damages on account 
of the non-fulfillment of the contract, I will order the 
present suit commenced against you at New Orleans to 
be dismissed. As your letter of the 8th ult. appears to 
have been dictated by a spirit of accommodation, permit 
me now, sir, to test its character by suggesting that I 
have no view " to reaction " upon you in whatever opera 
tions I may essay to obtain some indemnity for my losses. 
These, Governor Alston may have stated to you, I esti 
mate at $50,000, of which his Excellency has already 



THREATS. 551 

reimbursed, I believe, $12,500, and it is very probable 
nothing short of the publication of my book, hitherto 
postponed only by sickness, will bring me any part of 
the balance so long sought in vain from his honor and 
engagements. His well-earned election to the chief ex 
ecutive office of his State, and your return from Europe, 
will, however, now render the publication more effective 
than it would have been prior to these events, and it will 
be expedited within three months from this date, if all 
other means of indemnity fail within that period. I 
would still agree to accept from any other source $15,000, 
in lieu of the balance I claim of $37,500, and, of course, 
withhold the book, which is entitled, " A Review of the

From Mr. Emmett. 

FEW YORK, August 24th, 1815. 

DEAR BLENNERHASSETT : I hope, and am willing to 
believe, that a letter. I wrote you now some four or five 
years since, and which remains unanswered, was never 
received by you. It was directed in the same way as 
this, and the uncertainty of its fate makes me wish I 
knew a more safe and sure direction. I can not, how- 



T. A. EMMETT. 553 

ever, permit the inclosed,* which I have recently received 
from Ireland, to go forward without accompanying it by 
a few words from myself. 

Mr. Berwick has written to me also, and so far as I can 
judge, considering your situation, and the almost impos 
sibility of your pursuing your claim, I think the proposal 
contained in his letter very advantageous. It is very sel 
dom that an opportunity occurs here of learning any par 
ticulars respecting individuals in your part of the world ; 
but I have been led to hope that you have found it pleas 
ant and profitable to yourself and family ; and I assure 
you few persons would more rejoice at your prosperity 
than myself. 

Mrs. Emmett presents her best compliments to you, 
and joins in sincere regards with, dear Blennerhassett, 
Yours affectionately, THOS. ADDIS EMMETT. 



* The letter inclosed by Mr. Emmett, was from Mr. Berwick, a solicitor 
in Dublin, who was engaged to collect information respecting a property 
in Ireland, called the Bawn estate, to which Blennerhassett was entitled 
in right of his descent from the Harman family.

CHAPTER XV. 

MOST, if not all, of the characters involved in the en 
terprise of Burr have passed from the theater of life ; 
their acts are left to the anxious scrutiny of an impartial 
posterity. The sanctity of the sepulcher should cover 
their remains with the mantle of charity. But an ac 
count of the origin, and a relation of the circumstances 
attending the event, may not be unacceptable to the 
readers of the present day, and will prove a theme of 
historical interest to those who follow us. 

The disaffection which had existed in the West, al 
though greatly diminished by the failure of the designs 
of the French minister, had never been entirely recon 
ciled. The zeal of the Spanish emissaries received but a 
temporary check in the abortive attempt of Wilkinson 
and Miro. Wilkinson was yet a pensioner of Spain, and 
an officer of rank in the American army. Miro had been 
gratified in his long-cherished wish to return to the 
mother country, and the Baron de Carondelet had suc 
ceeded to the government. 

In the year 1795, Governor Gayoso ascended the Mis 
sissippi with a detachment of the King's troops, destined 
to erect and garrison the fort of San Fernando de las 
Barancas. Thence he proceeded to "New Madrid, and 
held an interview with Don Thomas Portell relative to 



PLANS. 555 

the affairs of the western country. It was resolved 
to send Thomas Power with important dispatches to 
General Wilkinson. Power had twice before been in 
trusted with similar important missions. In 1794, he had 
penetrated Kentucky as a Spanish spy on the movements 
of Genet, and had also accompanied the captive Span 
iards, who had robbed and murdered Owen, the bearer 
of six thousand dollars from the Spanish Government to 
Wilkinson, it being the pension granted by the Court at 
Madrid to him and other Spanish-American emissaries in 
Kentucky. 

Power proceeded up the river in a pirogue, as far as 
Red Banks, whence he diverged across the country to 
Cincinnati, and, after numerous delays, occasioned by 
sickness, reached Lexington on the 8th of October. Here 
he found Wilkinson, to whom he delivered his dispatches 
and the verbal messages which had not been committed 
to writing. As yet, Power had been but partially admit 
ted to the secret, but Wilkinson now disclosed the whole 
design, which embraced a separation of the Western 
from the Eastern States. 

As a means of effecting this, among other plans, it was 
proposed that the mouth of the Ohio should be formida 
bly fortified ; that the works to be erected should be of 
sufficient strength to arrest the progress of an army for 
an entire campaign ; that in its construction Kentuckians 
only were to be employed this, it was presumed, would 
dissipate national prejudices and patronize the citizens of 
the respective governments. The manufacture of neces 
sary ordnance was to be carried on in the district of 
Kentucky. The establishment of a bank, with a capital 



556 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

of one million of dollars, the directors of which were to 
be chosen from the most distinguished and leading men 
of the country, was expected to wield an irresistible influ 
ence over the public councils and private sentiments of 
the Territory. Money was to be conveyed by packing it 
in barrels of coffee or sugar, unknown to the parties 
transporting it, and effectually concealing it from public 
observation. Under no circumstances was the fort of 
San Fernando to be surrendered by Spain, as such an act 
would lessen her importance and invite the rapacity of 
the American Government. As the seeds of approaching 
rupture had already been sown, it was important that 
additional fortifications should be erected, and an in 
creased number of Spanish agents distributed through 
the disaffected districts, with a sufficiency of funds for 
any and every emergency. General Clark and his ad 
herents, who were involved in the intrigues of the French 
and in the pay of the French Republic, were to be trans 
ferred to the service of Spain, with promises of greater 
emoluments, and equal participation in benefits. New 
Madrid was designated as a depositary for the munitions 
of war, of which an adequate supply was to be kept 
always on hand. 

Power was directed by Wilkinson to proceed to the 
French settlement, at Gallipolis, to sound the disposition 
of the people, who, it was conjectured, were favorable to 
the measure, and were willing to proclaim their inde 
pendence whenever, by concert of action, on the part of 
other districts, the act should be deemed available. From 
thence he was to proceed to Red Bank, where he should 
meet Sebastian, Innis, Murray and Nicholas, whom he

was to convey to the mouth of the Ohio, where Gayoso 
was in waiting to receive them. 

Having performed this mission, Power again reached 
New Madrid, where, purchasing a pirogue for the accom 
modation of his companions, toward the beginning of 
December, he set off for the Red Banks. 

On his arrival he found Sebastian only, as Innis had 
been detained at home through indisposition ; Nicholas, 
through fear that his absence from court might occasion 
suspicion ; and Murray, in consequence of his habits of 
dissipation, rendering him incompetent for business. 
Sebastian had already engaged a passage in a flat-boat, 
and the two set out for the mouth of the Ohio. Here 
they found Gayoso encamped on the opposite bank of 
the river, where he had been amusing himself in con 
structing a small triangular fort, more for the purpose 
of eluding suspicion than from any necessity the occasion 
demanded. "Wilkinson's dispatch, in cipher, was delivered 
by Power to Gayoso ; a conference between Sebastian and 
himself was held ; and, after a detention of several days 
by rain, the whole party descended to Natchez, where 
they were hospitably entertained by Gayoso at the Gov 
ernment House. 

Sebastian had been invested with plenary powers to 
co-operate with Gayoso in perfecting the plans of Wil 
kinson and his Spanish associates. Power proceeded in 
advance to New Orleans, whither he was soon followed 
by the Governor and Sebastian. 

The succeeding spring, the latter, accompanied by 
Power, sailed for Philadelphia, to reconnoiter the route 
across the Alleganies. Proceeding as far as Shippens- 



558 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

burg, they placed their baggage in a wagon, and con 
tinued their journey to Red Stone on foot. Here they 
embarked in a flat, bound to Cincinnati, where they 
arrived about the middle of May. At this point the two 
separated, Sebastian descending to Louisville and Power 
proceeding to Greenville, then the head-quarters of Wil 
kinson. 

Wilkinson had but recently learned of the arrival, at 
New Madrid, of a large sum of money, forwarded from 
the authorities in Louisiana, and requested Power to pro 
ceed immediately thither, and have the same safely 
delivered in Kentucky. Power, having satisfactorily 
performed the mission, by delivering it to Philip Nolan, 
the accredited agent of the General, returned to New 
Orleans. * 

But Power was not destined long to remain inactive. 
He had proven himself an adroit and energetic agent, 
and stood high in the estimation of the Spanish Govern 
ment. In 1797, he was again intrusted with a similar 
mission to Kentucky. Among others, he presented his 
scheme to George Nichols, an attorney at Lexington, 
who, Wilkinson had informed him, was favorable to 
Spanish interest. But no sooner had he disclosed his 
designs than Nichols rebuked him for his impertinence, 
and spurned the idea of receiving foreign gold. Power, 
finding but little encouragement in Kentucky, sought an 
interview with Wilkinson, then at Detroit. He was 
received by the General with cold civility; nay, with 
haughty abruptness. This was in public. In private he

INSTRUCTIONS. 559 

whispered, " we are both lost, without being able to de 
rive any advantage from your journey." Eumor had 
connected him with the Spanish intrigue. Power was 
known as a Spanish spy, and Wilkinson had been often 
observed in conference with him. His complicity with 
the authorities of Louisiana had been the subject of a 
communication from Wayne to Washington; and Elli- 
cott, the commissioner, was instructed to watch him. 
Through the medium of a person in the service of the 
Governor-General, Ellicott had learned of the mission of 
Power, and of the instructions with which he was 
charged. As they disclose a plan similar, in many re 
spects, to that of Burr, and as there is now but little 
doubt that it was, at least, suggestive, it is here inserted 
for future illustration. After stating the ostensible object 
of his visit to be the adjustment of the difficulties and 
securing the delay of the Spanish Government, in sur 
rendering to the United States of the forts of Walnut 
Hills and Natchez, under the second article of the treaty, 
of which fortifications Wilkinson had previously advised 
the Baron de Carondolet he was preparing to take forci 
ble possession, the instructions proceed : 

" The second object of your commission, which no one 
must penetrate, and for which reason you must retain in 
your memory, is to sound and examine the disposition of 
the people of the Western States, whose militia, it is 
reported to me, has received orders to march on the 
first advice ; and, in case that be true, you will inform the 
commandant of New Madrid of it, by the first oppor 
tunity you find. But, in order not to render yourself 
suspected, you will content yourself with putting the 



560 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

date of your letter at the bottom, and will only treat of 
indifferent subjects. If hostile preparations are making, 
yon will put before your signature a stroke like that 
which freemasons use, and which you see at the bottom 
of this letter ; the number of dots above will designate 
that of thousand men, and that below, the hundreds of 
which this expedition is to be composed. You will point 
out the number of pieces of artillery by a number of 
points placed in your nourish, according to your custom, 
the points on the left signifying tens, and those on the 
right units. This letter will be immediately sent me by 
the commandant of New Madrid, in consequence of the 
orders I shall give him. On your journey, you will give 
to understand adroitly, to those persons to whom you 
will have an opportunity of speaking, that the delivery 
of the posts, which the Spaniards occupy on the Missis 
sippi, to the troops of the United States, is directly op 
posed to the interests of those on the West, who, as they 
must one day separate from the Atlantic States, would 
find themselves without any communication with Lower 
Louisiana, from whence they ought to expect to re 
ceive powerful succor in artillery, arms, ammunition and 
money, either publicly or secretly, as soon as ever the 
Western States shall determine on a separation, which 
must insure their prosperity and their independence ; that 
for this same reason, Congress is resolved on risking 
every thing to take these posts from Spain ; and that it 
would be forging fetters for themselves to furnish it with 
militia and means which it can only find in the Western 
States. These same reasons diffused abroad, by means 
of the public papers, might make the strongest impres- 



ANTICIPATIONS. 561 

sion on the people, and induce them to throw off the 
yoke of the Atlantic States ; but, at the very least, if we 
are able to dissuade them from taking part in this expe 
dition, I doubt whether the States could give law to us, 
with such troops alone as they have now on foot. 

" If a hundred thousand dollars, distributed in Ken 
tucky, could cause it to rise in insurrection, I am very 
certain that the minister, in the present circumstances, 
would sacrifice them with pleasure ; and you may, with 
out exposing yourself too much, promise them to those 
who enjoy the confidence of the people, with another 
equal sum to arm them, in case of necessity, and twenty 
pieces of field artillery. You will arrive without danger, 
as bearer of dispatches for the General, where the army 
may be, whose force, discipline and dispositions you will 
examine with care ; and you will endeavor to discover, 
with your natural penetration, the General's disposition. 
I doubt that a person of his character would prefer,, 
through vanity, the advantage of commanding the army 
of the Atlantic States to that of being the founder, the 
liberator, in fine, the Washington, of the Western States. 
His part is as brilliant as it is easy. All eyes are drawn 
toward him. He possesses the confidence of his fellow- 
citizens and of the Kentucky volunteers. At the slight 
est movement the people will name him the General of 
the New Republic ; his reputation will raise an army for 
him, and Spain, as well as France, will furnish him the 
means of paying it. On taking Fort Massac, we will 
send him, instantly, arms and artillery; and Spain, limit 
ing herself to the possession of the forts of Natchez and 
Walnut Hills, as far as Fort Confederation, will cede to 
36 



562 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the Western States all the eastern bank to the Ohio, 
which will form a very extensive and powerful republic, 
connected by its situation and by its interest with Spain, 
which, in concert with it, will force the savages to become 
a party to it, and to confound themselves in time with its 
citizens. The public is disconcerted with the new taxes ; 
Spain and France are enraged at the connections of the 
United States with England ; the army is weak and de 
voted to Wilkinson ; the threats of Congress authorize 
me to succor, on the spot and openly, the Western States ; 
money will not then be wanting to me, for I shall send, 
without delay, a ship to Yera Cruz in search of it, as 
well as of ammunition. Nothing more will consequently 
be required but an instant of firmness and resolution to 
make the people of the West perfectly happy. If they 
suffer this instant to escape them, and that we should be 
forced to deliver up the posts, Kentucky and Tennessee, 
surrounded by the said posts, and without communica 
tion with Lower Louisiana, will ever remain under the 
oppression of the Atlantic States. 

" If you represent forcibly these reasons to Wilkinson, 
Sebastian, La Casagne, etc., and if you diffuse these no 
tions among the people, gaining by promises, which shall 
be fully realized, the best writers, as Breckenridge and 
others, you will be able to effect the most fortunate and 
most glorious commotion ; you will cover yourself with 
glory, and you may expect the most brilliant fortune ; if, 
on the contrary, you should fail in this commission, it 
will not deprive me of the opportunity of obtaining for 
you, from the minister, an appointment which will render 
you independent of hatred or jealousy." 



RECEDING. 563 

When Wilkinson, therefore, found himself publicly 
approached by Power, he conceived it prudent to dissem 
ble, to cast from himself any suspicions which this visit 
of Power might have occasioned. Hence he informed 
him that the Executive had given orders to the Governor 
of the North- West Territory to arrest him, and send him 
to Philadelphia; that there was no other resource of 
escape but by permitting himself to be conducted under 
guard to Fort Massac, and from thence to New Madrid. 
With reference to the Baron's instructions he said, that 
the project was chimerical ; that the inhabitants of the 
Western States, having obtained by treaty all they de 
sired, would not wish to form any other political or com 
mercial alliances ; that they had no motive for separating 
themselves from the interests of the other states of the 
Union, even if France and Spain should make them the 
most advantageous offers ; that the fermentation which 
had existed four years back was then appeased ; that the 
depredations and vexations which American commerce 
suffered from the French privateers had inspired them 
with an implacable hatred for their nation ; that some 
of the Kentuckians had proposed to him to raise three 
thousand men to invade Louisiana, in case war should be 
declared between the United States and Spain ; that the 
latter had no other course to pursue, under the circum 
stances, but comply with the recent treat}' which he de 
clared had overturned all his plans, and rendered useless 
the labors of more than ten years. As for himself he 
had destroyed his ciphers, and burned his correspondence 
with the Spanish Government ; that duty and honor did 
not permit him to continue it, and that the Governor of 



564 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Louisiana ought not to be apprehensive of his abusing 
the confidence which he had placed in him. He added, 
that Spain, by delivering up to the United States the ter 
ritory of Natchez, might, perhaps, name him governor 
of it, and that then he would not want opportunities to 
take more effectual measures to comply with his political 
projects.* 

These facts disclose the continued complicity of Wil 
kinson with the Spanish Government, long after his ap 
pointment as Brigadier-General of the American forces 
in the West, and at and after the death of Wayne, upon 
which event he became Commander-in-chief. 

A descent upon Mexico, on the part of many of the 
Spanish American settlers, was a subject of secret agita 
tion, during a period of years prior to the cession of 
Louisiana to France. " The emigration from the west 
ern part of the United States," writes Don Luis de Pefi- 
alvert y Cardenas, Bishop of Louisiana, in 1799, " and 
the toleration of our government, have introduced into 
this colony a gang of adventurers who have no religion, 
and acknowledge no God. They have made much worse 
the morals of our people, by their coming in contact with 
their trading pursuits." 

" The adventurers I speak of have scattered themselves 
over the districts of Attakapas, Opelousas, Ouachita and 
Natchitoches, in the vicinity of the province of Texas, in 
New Spain ; they employ the Indians on their farms, 
have frequent intercourse and conversation with them, 
and impress their minds with pernicious maxims, in har-

PRECAUTIONS. 565 

mony with their own restless and ambitious temper, and 
with the customs of their own western countrymen, who 
are in the habit of saying to such of their boys as are 
distinguished for a robust frame, while patting them on 
the shoulder, ' you will be the man to go to Mexico.' "* 

Since the year 1785, the United States had aimed at 
taking possession of Natchez and all the Territory which 
had been assigned to them by the treaty of 1783. Spain 
had persistently opposed the measure, and, through her 
emissaries in the western provinces of the Union, and her 
protracted negotiations, had succeeded in suspending the 
hostilities with which she was afterward threatened. 
Until the year 1797, she successfully eluded the claims 
of the American Government, when she was compelled 
to accede to its demands, in order not to expose herself 
to the loss of the whole of Louisiana. 

As the Americans had now become in possession of 
the new frontiers, it became more than ever urgent to 
secure to the Spanish Government an effectual barrier 
for the protection of Mexico. There were two ways sug 
gested by which this object was to be accomplished ; f 
first, to establish in Louisiana a population sufficiently 
large to defend her against any aggression ; second, to 
form a union with Kentucky and the other districts of 
the West, with the obligation, on their part, to serve as a 
rampart against the United States.

VoL III, p. 410. 



566 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

In a memoir addressed to the First Consul of France, 
by M. de Pontalba, who had been directed to collect in 
formation on the resources of Louisiana, he says : " All 
this proves that the only commercial outlet for their pro 
duce is the Mississippi ; that Louisiana can never cease to 
be the object of their ambition, as they depend on her in 
the most absolute manner ; that their position, the num 
ber of their population, and their other means, will ena 
ble them to invade this province whenever they may 
choose to do so ; and that, to preserve her, it is necessary 
to conciliate and control them by keeping up intelligences 
with the most influential men among them, and to grant 
them privileges until this province be sufficiently strong 
to defend herself with her own resources against the tor 
rent which threatens her. Should its waters be let loose, 
there is no doubt but that they would sweep every thing 
on their passage ; for the Kentuckians, single-handed, or 
allied with the inhabitants of the neighboring districts, 
may, when they choose, reach ISTew Orleans with twenty 
or thirty thousand men, transferred on large flat-boats, 
which they are in the daily habit of constructing, to carry 
their produce to market, and, protected by a few gun 
boats, loaded with more provision than they need. The 
rapidity of the current of the Ohio, and of the other 
waters which discharge themselves into it, makes it an 
easy undertaking ; and the paucity of their wants would 
accelerate its execution. A powder-horn, a bag of balls, 
a rifle, and a sufficient provision of flour this would be 
the extent of their military equipment. A great deal of 
skill in shooting, the habit of being in the woods and of 



EXPECTATIONS. 567 

enduring fatigue this is what makes up for every de 
ficiency." * 

Again, he remarks, " what entitles Louisiana to pecu 
liar attention is the fact of her being a port in the Gulf 
of Mexico, where no other power than Spain has any ; 
but what gives her still more value is, her position in 
relation to the kingdom of Mexico, whose natural barrier 
is the Mississippi. 

" It is necessary to make this barrier an impenetrable 
one. It is the surest means of destroying forever the 
bold schemes with which several individuals in the United 
States never cease filling the newspapers, by designating 
Louisiana as the high road to the conquest of Mexico, 
particularly ever since the occurring of differences with 
regard to its limits." 

Pontalba advised that peace should be observed be 
tween France and the United States ; for otherwise the 
inhabitants of the West would precipitate themselves 
upon Louisiana, and wrest it by force from the dominion 
of France. This, he declared, had been the policy of 
Spain since 1797. " It was assisted in this policy," he 
says, " by a powerful inhabitant of Kentucky,f who pos 
sesses much influence with his countrymen, and enjoys 
great consideration for the services he has rendered the 
cause of liberty when occupying high grades in the army 
of the United States ; who, from that time, has never 
ceased to serve Spain in all her views, and who will put 
the same zeal at the command of France, because he thinks,

t General Wilkinson. 



568 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

with reason, that an intimate union between her and 
Louisiana is more advantageous to his country, Ken 
tucky, than its present relation with the United States." * 

M. de Pontalba discloses the fact that he also had been 
in secret conference with Wilkinson, who had imparted 
to the French agent his knowledge of the policy and 
designs of Spain, and his own complicity with the Span 
ish authorities. " This individual," he continues, " whose 
name I shall not mention, in order not to expose him, 
but which I shall make known when his services are 
wanted, came to New Orleans in 1787. He informed the 
Spanish Government of the state of things then existing 
in Kentucky and the adjoining districts, and of the efforts 
which the inhabitants of those provinces were making to 
obtain their independence and the free navigation of the 
Mississippi. He also declared that there was a general 
disposition among the people to place themselves under 
the protection of Spain, should Congress refuse to do 
justice to their claim. 

" It is on that refusal that this inhabitant of Kentucky 
had founded all his hopes, and, in that case, he had 
offered to declare himself the vassal of his Catholic Ma 
jesty. He proceeded as such to give information of all 
that the inhabitants of that region would undertake for 
or against Louisiana, in order to increase our strength. 
It was with this disposition he went back." 

In a note at the hottom of the manuscript he adds : 
" Four times, from 1786 to 1792, propositions were made 
to Kentucky and Cumberland to attack Louisiana; and

WILKINSON. 569 

every time this same individual caused them to fail, 
through his influence over his countrymen. I make 
these facts known to show that France must not neglect to 
enlist this individual in her service." * 

A minute detail of events, which occurred subsequent 
to these transactions, and prior to the organization of the 
Burr expedition, belongs more particularly to the province 
of history. Taken in connection with the facts afterward 
developed, they point unerringly to Wilkinson, as the 
author of that famed event. From the year 1787 to 
within a brief period preceding the movements of Burr, 
he has been shown to have been closely allied to the in 
terests of the Spanish crown. He had not only secretly 
advocated disunion, but was undoubtedly a pensioner of 
the Spanish Court. From his intimacy with the affairs 
of Louisiana, and the designs of Spain and the French 
Republic, his intelligence upon all subjects involving the 
interests of either, was seldom surpassed by those of their 
own officials. A life of restless activity, an intimacy with 
the inhabitants, both of the western country and Lou 
isiana; a thorough knowledge of the topography of the 
country and the routes which penetrated the Spanish 
dominions ; a lust for power and position, with an unholy 
ambition for wealth, at the sacrifice even of honor, in 
tegrity and patriotism ; a cultivated talent for intrigue 
and a dissembler in national diplomacy, with a spirit of 
adventure, which time had not subdued, and surrounded 
by restless spirits, to whom war was preferable to repose, 
he stood unrivaled as a leader of predatory incursions 
and revolutionary leagues. 

Gayarre's History of Louisiana, Vol. Ill, p. 414. 



570 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

He was known to be the intimate friend and companion 
of Burr. They had served in the revolutionary strug 
gles together. On the fatal occasion of the fall of Ham 
ilton, he had been among the first to rally to the support 
of the declining popularity of his early associate. He 
had spent the winter preceding the close of Burr's Vice- 
Presidency, at Washington, and secured his agency in 
procuring the governorship of Louisiana. He had held 
secret counsels with him, introduced to his acquaintance 
many of his personal friends, and, as Burr repeatedly 
alleged, detailed to him all the information he possessed 
respecting Mexico, and pointed out the facilities which 
would probably be offered by the inhabitants in effecting 
a revolution. As has been related in a former chapter, 
on his first visit to the West, Burr visited Wilkinson, by 
whom he was most graciously received, and furnished 
with letters of introduction to many of the energetic and 
influential characters of the South and West. 

The project of a dismemberment of the Union, and the 
annexation of the trans- Allegany Territory to Louisiana, 
can not therefore be said to have originated with Burr. 
It was a subject of almost constant agitation in the coun 
try for more than fifteen years prior to his undertaking, 
and, at one time, embraced many leading supporters in 
the West. Nor was the invasion of Mexico a startling 
proposition, now for the first time advanced, for it too 
had its advocates, and preceding the purchase of Louis 
iana, by the United States, might have been successfully 
carried into execution. 

There was another scheme, however, which had but 
recently before been originated, and which, perhaps, aided 



MIRANDA. 571 

more than all others in giving it vitality and setting it 
on foot. 

The provinces of South America had long felt a desire 
to resist the authority of Spain. Miranda, a bold and 
energetic leader, with other of his fellow-patriots, had 
conceived the design of overthrowing the Spanish dy 
nasty, and establishing, on its ruins, an v independent 
republic. He hoped to procure, as allies, in this hercu 
lean undertaking, both the United States and Great 
Britain. With that view, he visited this country, in 
1797-'8, and sought the acquaintance of the most distin 
guished Americans. Knox and Hamilton, who stood 
high in influence and official station, favored his project. 
He afterward proceeded to England, and presented 
himself to the British ministry. They entered into his 
views. The proposition was that the United States 
should furnish ten thousand troops, and, in that event, 
the British Government agreed to supply the necessary 
funds and ships to carry on the expedition. From sev 
eral communications addressed by Miranda to General 
Hamilton, it appears that the auxiliary land forces were 
to be exclusively American, and that of the navy, Eng 
lish. The enterprise would, doubtless, have proceeded, 
had not the elder Adams, who was at that time Presi 
dent, declined entering into the arrangement. 

At the period of the commencement of the expedition, 
various favorable circumstances rendered the undertak 
ing apparently auspicious. The difficulties with Spain, 
before alluded to ; the restlessness and disaffection of 
many of the officers and soldiers of the regular army in 
the West, who had become tired of a life of inactivity

and ease, where there were no amusements to while 
away their vacant hours, nor fields of battle from whence 
to pluck the never-fading laurels of conquest ; a lack of 
harmony, not only between the civil and military author 
ities, but in the ranks of the military themselves ; all 
these considerations might well have flattered Burr that 
the fates were favorable to the adventurer. " Indeed, I 
fear treachery has become the order of the day," writes 
General Jackson to Olaiborne. " There is something 
rotten in the state of Denmark." The facetious McKee, 
in a communication to Wilkinson, remarks : " Your 
letter found me far gone in the blue devils, doubting 
whether I had better expatriate myself, and try my for 
tunes amid the storm now gathering in Europe ; how 
ever, nil disperandum Teucro duce auspice Teucro. I'll 
remain here till X'mas." 

An extensive correspondence with various distinguished 
characters of the country, assured Burr of their counte 
nance and co-operation, in the event of a war with Spain. 
Wilkinson writes him, under date of October, 1805 : " I 
fear Miranda has taken the bread out of your mouth." 
"Wilkinson's regular force consisted only of about six 
hunded men, around which the followers of Burr were 
to form. These, in fact, were the only disciplined corps 
relied on. It is said the commander had pledged him 
self to strike the blow, whenever it should be deemed 
expedient. All that was wanting, with him, was a pre 
text for the commencement of hostilities against Spain. 
" On his suggestion, Daniel Clark twice visited the coun 
try, lie held conferences, and effected arrangements, with 
many of the principal military officers, who engaged to 



INTRIGUE. 573 

favor the Revolution. The Catholic Bishop, resident at 
New Orleans, was also consulted, and prepared to pro 
mote the enterprise. He designated the priests of the 
order of Jesuits as suitable agents, and they were accord 
ingly employed. The bishop was an intelligent and 
social man. He had been in Mexico, and spoke with 
great freedom of the disaffection of the clergy in South 
America. The religious establishments of the country 
were not to be molested. Madam Xavier Tarjcon, su 
perior of the Ursuline nuns at New Orleans, was in the 
secret. Some of the sisterhood were also employed in 
Mexico. So far as any decision had been formed, the 
landing was to have been effected at Tampico." * 

Daniel Clark engaged to advance, for the purpose of 
the expedition, $50,000 ; but, being disappointed, was 
unable to furnish it. Murray, the British Plenipotentiary, 
resident in the United States, was consulted on the sub 
ject. He communicated to his Government the project 
of Burr. Col. Williamson, *the brother of Lord Balgray, 
was dispatched to England on the business ; and, from 
the manner of his reception and the encouragement he 
received, it was expected that a British naval squadron 
would have been furnished for the enterprise. 

But of all the devices which his ingenuity suggested, 
there was none so startling as his intrigue with the Span 
ish minister. Spain, although having surrendered her 
dominion in Louisiana to France, who, in turn, had ceded 
that Territory to the United States, still held possessions in 
Florida. She yet cherished her old resentments against 



* Davis's Memoirs of Burr, Vol. II, p. 382. 



574 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the American Government, and would have willingly co 
operated to effect a severance of the Union. A protracted 
and angry correspondence between the plenipotentiaries 
of both governments had given rise to much acrimony 
of feeling ; and an open rupture, if not an immediate 
resort to arms, seemed almost inevitable. It was at this 
juncture of affairs that Burr, having become familiar 
with her former intrigues through Wilkinson, dispatched 
De Pestre, his confidential agent, to Yrujo, the Spanish 
minister, offering the services of himself and followers to 
the cause of the Spanish crown. Proposals were made 
that Spain should furnish the means and arms, while the 
forces were to be supplied by Burr. 

Yrujo, however, learning, in the mean time, that so far 
from aiding the cause of his Spanish master, it was 
merely a device to procure the means and arms to wrest 
from the possession of the crown its possession in Mexico, 
withdrew his aid before the negotiations were entirely 
completed. 

" This evening," says Blennerhassett, " De Pestre spent 
an hour with me, which was passed in a more detailed 
view of his past concerns with Burr. He gave me a de 
scription of the manners and character of Yrujo, who 
is reconfirmed in his embassy to this country, in spite of 
all the efforts of the Government for his removal. This 
minister is. according to De Pestre's portrait of him, a 
shrewd politician, who pierced the cobweb tissue of 
Burr's intrigue with him at a single glance. Though he 
assured De Pestre, who was charged in Kentucky, last 
October, w*th a special mission to him, that had Burr 
opened his designs with frankness, and really projected 



MISREPRESENTATIONS. 575 

a severance of the Union, and nothing hostile to the 
Spanish provinces, he, Burr, might have had an easy 
resort to the Spanish treasury and its arsenals, while his 
confidence would have been safely lodged in the honor 
of a Spanish nobleman. But Yrujo laughed at the awk 
wardness with which Burr endeavored to mask his de 
sign on Mexico, and expressed his concern for De Pestre's 
having lost his time in such a service." 

Burr was much mortified and annoyed at the penetra 
tion of his intended victim, and at the time of his em 
barrassments on the Mississippi, by Wilkinson, declared, 
in the presence of Smith and Blennerhassett, that De 
Pestre should be hung for his ineffectual negotiations. 

Twice, as we have seen, Burr visited the West. Wher 
ever he went he spoke disrespectfully of the Government 
of his country, with the view to facilitate the consumma 
tion of his own designs. He represented it as destitute 
of energy to support or defend our national rights against 
foreign enemies, and of a spirit to maintain our national 
character ; that, in fact, we had no character at home or 
abroad. To those in whom he confided, he asserted, that 
all men of property and influence were dissatisfied with 
its arrangements, because they were not in a proper situ 
ation, to which they were entitled ; that with five hun 
dred men he could effect a revolution, by which he could 
send the President to Monticello, intimidate Congress 
and take the government of the United States into his 
own hands ; that the people of the Union had so little 
knowledge of their rights, and so slight an inclination to 
maintain them, that they would tamely acquiesce in this 
shameful usurpation. This was addressed to the inhab- 



576 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

itants of the East. In the "West, he sought to arouse 
their old and long-cherished prejudices. He told them 
they were in a state of colonial dependence on the Atlan 
tic States, and annually paid millions to the Government, 
from which they derived no benefit, nor received protec 
tion, in return. He urged that a severance of the Union 
was necessary, and must inevitably take place ; that this 
would not be effected by the operation of natural or of 
moral and political causes, but as determined by a chain 
of events ; that the destiny of the Republic was fixed, 
and that this resolution would be accomplished in less 
than two years. To the world at large, and to those with 
whom he, had not tampered, the object of his enterprise 
was held forth as a settlement of the Bastrop lands. To 
some, intimations were dropped of an approaching rupture 
with Spain, against whose provinces the expedition was 
intended ; and the conquest of Mexico was alluded to. 
To a few only his real design was developed ; but to all, 
he said, there was a great scheme in view ; that the en 
terprise was a just and honorable one, known and ap 
proved by the Government, in which the co-operation 
of the army was to be expected, in which great wealth 
was to be acquired, and that it would be fully disclosed 
at the proper time. 

Such were the preparations : a plan well matured, and 
auguring success, in the event of a war with Spain ; for 
upon this event alone, let it be remembered, had his prin 
cipal force consented to join the expedition. As soon, 
however, as intelligence had been received, that such sat 
isfaction had been rendered, on the part of the Spanish 
Government, as to obviate the necessity of a resort -to 



LOSING GROUND. 577 

arms, many of the warmest advocates of the plan aban 
doned their former designs, and turned their attention to 
scenes less dazzling but more productive of substantial 
enjoyment. " I had written a great deal," says McKee, 
" about recruiting in Tennessee, about cutting and slash 
ing and packing dollars, and enjoying otium cum. digni- 
tate, but i all our differences being settled with Spain ' knocks 
all my Utopia to the devil ! " 

Burr had dreamed too long of the wealth and splendor 
of the halls of the Montezumas, to resign their captivat 
ing pleasures for the tamer scenes of a government in 
which he was becoming daily more unpopular; and 
which, he now conceived, viewed his actions with un 
grateful suspicions. For years had he cherished the 
hope of investing himself with the regal power of that 
ancient kingdom, and transmitting its crown to his latest 
posterity. For the realization of this, had he sacrificed 
the comforts of home ; traversed the States to the ex 
tremes of Florida ; often traveling through pathless wil 
dernesses, sometimes without shelter, and occasionally 
without food, alluring to his standard men of every 
grade, prompted by every motive of action. 

Confident of the aid of Wilkinson, and the forces un 
der his command, he continued his exertions, after every 
prospect of a war with Spain had ceased. Whatever 
motive may have influenced the subsequent conduct of 
that officer, there is but little doubt that he had given 
Burr the most indubitable assurance of his firm adhesion. 
In the vagueness of conjecture, charity would, indeed, 
suggest such reasons for the change, as usually actuates 
the soldier and the patriot ; but, unfortunately opposed 
37 



578 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

to this conclusion, is his demand of the Spanish viceroy, 
of the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, " for great 
pecuniary sacrifices, in defeating Burr's plans, and, Leon- 
idas-like, throwing himself in the pass of Thermopylae.' 

Notwithstanding the suspicions with which his move 
ments were observed hy the Government, the acts of the 
Ohio legislature, and his arrest in Kentucky, Burr still 
persisted in his measures, giving confidence to his follow 
ers hy his unflinching determination. Even the procla 
mation of the President, and of the several Governors 
within the respective States and Territories along his 
route, could not deter him. But, when he was informed 
that the measures adopted by the government for his 
arrest were through the advice and at the instance of 
Wilkinson ; that he had not only proved treacherous by 
exposing the scheme and magnifying its object, but was 
the chosen instrument for his arrest ; that courage, which 
had before characterized his actions, completely aban 
doned him ; then, and not till then, did he sink under 
the accumulated difficulties which beset his path. 

He was arrested, tried and acquitted, "but his country 
refused to believe him innocent. Though stout old Trux- 
ton had testified in his favor ; though Jackson had seen 
nothing wrong in Burr's project, the popular voice con 
tinued to regard him as a traitor, whom accident alone 
had prevented from dismembering the Union. 

" The real secret of the popular belief is to be found in 
the character of Burr. In him, the elements which make 
great and good men were strangely mixed up with those 
of which we may suppose the spirits of evil to pride them 
selves. He was brave, affable, munificent, of indomitable 



JEFFERSON. 570 

energy, of signal perseverance. In his own person, he 
combined two opposite natures. He was studious, but 
insinuating; dignified, yet seductive. Success did not 
intoxicate, nor reverse dismay him. Turning to the other 
aspect of his character, these great qualities sunk to 
insignificance, beside his evil ones. He was profligate in 
morals, public and private ; selfish and artful ; a master 
in dissimulation, treacherous, cold-hearted. Subtle, in 
triguing, full of promise, he shot upwards in popularity, 
with astonishing velocity; but a skeptic in honesty, a 
scorner of all things noble and good, he failed to secure 
the public confidence, and fell headlong from his dizzy 
eminence. Here lies the secret of his ruin. There was 
nothing in his character to which the great heart of the 
people could attach itself in love ; but they shrank from 
him, in mistrust, as from a cold and glittering serpent. 
The public rarely errs in an estimate like this." 

It has been alleged of Mr. Jefferson, that he was 
privy to Burr's arrangements ; and that they were tacitly 
assented to by him. In viewing the various circum 
stances, particularly the conduct of the President himself, 
it would at first appear that such an allegation was not 
altogether groundless. Burr had been a formidable rival 
in his master-struggle for the Presidency. It had re 
quired thirty ballotings to decide the question between 
them, and Jefferson's final success was owing to a com 
promise of the members of the Senate, by which the 
votes of Vermont, Delaware and Maryland were with 
drawn from the opposition, through no particular prefer 
ences for the latter, but to conciliate parties and bury in 
silence the exciting topic. 



580 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The subject of the conquest of Mexico was daily con 
versed upon by the officers of the various Departments, 
as is clearly established by the evidence on the trial. The 
Spanish war was a theme of universal interest ; and, had 
that event happened, what cared the President whether 
the American forces paused on the banks of the Sabine, 
or carried their arms into the heart of Mexico. Already 
had arrangements been effected between the Government 
and the Spanish officers of Louisiana and Florida, by 
which those officers were to favor the Americans, in case 
of a war, and rally under the standard of the forces of 
the Union.* And such would, doubtless, have been the 



* " John Smith, a member of the United States Senate from Ohio, who 
was arrested as an accomplice of Burr, in a conversation with his friends, 
stated that, before the movements of Burr had attracted general notice, 
Mr. Jefferson requested a confidential interview with him, Smith, at which 
he inquired if he was not personally acquainted with the Spanish officers 
of Louisiana and Florida. On being answered in the affirmative, he went 
on to state, that a war with Spain seemed to be inevitable ; and that it was 
very desirable to know the feelings of those men toward the United States, 
and whether reliance could be placed on their friendship, if a war should 
take place between the two countries. At the same time, he requested him 
to'visit the country, with reference to that object. Mr. Smith stated that 
he did visit the country, as requested ; and that, on his return, he re 
ported to Mr. Jefferson that the governor, the inferior officers, and the in 
habitants generally, were not only friendly, but were desirous of attach 
ing themselves to the United States. This was in the summer preceding 
the 'war message' against Spain, which was sent to the two Houses of 
Congress, in December, 1805. Although the message was confidential, it 
soon became known to the diplomatic corps at Washington ; and the French 
Ambassador was ordered, by his master, Napoleon, to inform the American 
Government that France would take a part with Spain, in any contest she 
might have with the United States. It is a matter of history, that, after 
that notice, the project against Spain, communicated in the confidential 
message, and referred to in the conversation with Mr. Smith, was aban 
doned ; and about the same time, measures were taken to stop the move 
ments of Burr. Burners Notes, p. 294." 



PROBABILITIES. 581 

case, had a declaration of war been proclaimed ; but an 
intimation from the French Ambassador, that the meas 
ure would call Napoleon to the aid of Spain, induced the 
Government to abandon its designs, and arrest the opera 
tions of Burr. 

But, whatever may be said to the contrary, it is hardly 
to be presumed that any treasonable designs were known 
to the President; at least, no satisfactory evidence has 
ever been disclosed to implicate him with the movement. 
Had a collision with Spain actually occurred, it is prob 
able no prosecution would ever have been instituted ; for, 
in that event, American arms proving victorious, Spanish 
domination would have been swept from the continent of 
the North, and the banners of Burr would have floated 
proudly over the halls of the Montezumas.

CHAPTER XVI. 

TEN years had passed rapidly away since the occur 
rences of the "Burr expedition." The prospect of re 
gaining his fortune became daily less flattering to Blen- 
nerhassett. His means were insufficient to enable him to 
procure a sufficient number of slaves to render the pro 
duction of cotton profitable. Hence he determined to 
dispose of his Mississippi estate, and try his fortunes in 
the growing metropolis of New York. An advertisement 
of the sale describes his possessions as consisting of one 
thousand acres of land, two hundred of which was under 
cultivation ; a dwelling-house, orchard and cotton gin, 
with many other improvements, within thirty-six miles 
of Washington, Mississippi Territory, and six from navi 
gation ; also, twenty-two negroes, the whole estimated at 
the sum of $27,000. 

From the proceeds of his sale he was enabled to satisfy 
his clamorous creditors, and make a small investment in 
the stocks of the banks of New York, to which city he 
shortly after removed. 

During the interval, from the time of his removal from 
the Mississippi Territory until the year 1819, he has left 
us no record of his history. The Duke of Richmond, an 
old schoolmate, had been recently appointed Governor of 
Canada. He had heard of the misfortunes of his friend, 



583 

and addressed him a communication tendering his assist 
ance. Blennerhassett's legal attainments qualified him 
for the duties of the bench, and, through the influence 
of the Governor, he hoped to secure a judgeship in one 
of the provincial courts. He accordingly removed to 
Montreal in 1819, and resumed the practice of the law in 
partnership with a Mr. Rossiter. Their success, however, 
did not prove flattering. Clients were few, and, as it 
appears from the correspondence which subsequently 
passed between them, were not of that class which most 
rapidly advance the fortunes of the profession. Blenner- 
hassett entertained greater expectations of the bench than 
of the bar, but no vacancy occurred in the judicial corps. 
It was while here, with prospects of poverty and blighted 
hopes thickening around them, that Mrs. Blennerhassett 
wrote the following lines descriptive of the " Isle," her 
former home. They are from the overflowing of a heart 
which had passed through much sorrow, and are an 
eloquent lament over the misfortunes and ruin of the 
family and fortune of Blennerhassett : 

"THE DESERTED ISLE." 

Like mournful echo, from the silent tomb, 

That pines away upon the midnight air, 

While the pale moon breaks out, with fitful gloom, 

Fond memory turns, with sad but welcome care, 

To scenes of desolation and despair, 

Once bright with all that beauty could bestow, 

That peace could shed, or youthful fancy know. 

To the fair isle, reverts the pleasing dream. 
Again thou risest, in thy green attire, 
Fresh, as at first, thy blooming graces seem , 



584 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

Thy groves, thy fields, their wonted sweets respire ; 
Again thou 'rt all my heart could e'er desire. 
0! why, dear Isle, art thou not still my own? 
Thy charms could then for all my griefs atone. 

The stranger that descends Ohio's stream, 
Charm'd with the beauteous prospects that arise, 
Marks the soft isles that, 'neath the glittering beam, 
Dance with the wave and mingle with the skies, 
Sees, also, one that now in ruin lies, 
Which erst, like fairy queen, towered o'er the rest, 
In every native charm, by culture, dress'd. 

There rose the seat, where once, in pride of life, 
My eye could mark the queenly river's flow, 
In summer's calmness, or in winter's strife, 
Swollen with rains, or battling with the snow. 
Never, again, my heart such joy shall know. 
Havoc, and ruin, rampant war, have pass'd 
Over that isle, with their destroying blast* 

The black'ning fire has swept throughout her halls 

The winds fly whistling o'er them, and the wave 

No more, in spring-floods, o'er the sand-beach crawls, 

But furious drowns in one o'erwhelming grave, 

Thy hallowed haunts it watered as a slave. 

Drive on, destructive flood ! and ne'er again 

On that devoted isle let man remain. 

Too many blissful moments there I 've known , 
Too many hopes have there met their decay ; 
Too many feelings now for ever gone, 
To wish that thou couldst ere again display 
The joyful coloring of thy prime array; 
Buried with thee, let them remain a blot, 
With thee, their sweets, their bitterness forgot. 

And, oh ! that I could wholly wipe away 
The memory of the ills that worked thy fall; 



ADVERSITY. 585 

The memory of that all-eventful day, 

When I return' d, and found my own fair hall 

Held by the infuriate populace in thrall, 

My own fireside blockaded by a band 

That once found food and shelter of my hand. 

My children, oh ! a mother's pangs forbear, 
Nor strike again that arrow to my soul; 
Clasping the ruffians in suppliant prayer, 
To free their mother from unjust control, 
While with false crimes and imprecations foul, 
The wretched, vilest refuse of the earth, 
Mock jurisdiction held around my hearth. 

Sweet isle ! methinks I see thy bosom torn ; 
Again behold the ruthless rabble throng, 
That wrought destruction taste must ever mourn. 
Alas! I see thee now, shall see thee long; 
But ne'er shall bitter feelings urge the wrong, 
That, to a mob, would give the censure, due 
To those that arm'd the plunder-greedy crew. 

Thy shores are warmed by bounteous suns in vain, 

Columbia! if spite and envy spring, 

To blot the beauty of mild nature's reign, 

The European stranger, who would fling, 

O'er tangled woods, refinement's polishing, 

May find, expended, every plan of taste, 

His work by ruffians render'd doubly waste. 

" Misfortune having marked him for her own," Blen- 
nerhassett's anticipated promotion was never realized. 
The capriciousriess of the British ministry had removed 
from office the sympathizing friend, and he found him 
self cast hopelessly upon the world, at an advanced age, 
without health, without energy, and almost destitute of 
the means of a comfortable subsistence. 



586 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

As a last resort, he determined to prosecute a rever 
sionary claim still existing in Ireland, regarded by him 
with indifference in his more affluent days, but which 
now, in his destitute situation, recommended itself strong 
ly to his attention. Through the influence of friends, he 
hoped also to obtain an office under the English Govern 
ment, by which he might the more readily gain the 
means for conducting the suit. 

Under these considerations he left the province of 
Canada and sailed for Ireland, in 1822. As the receding 
shores of the American continent were dimly shadowed 
in the distance, he cast a glance toward the fading scene. 
A recollection of the past was no pleasing retrospect. A 
quarter of a century had passed since he had hailed those 
shores, with buoyant hopes and joyful anticipations of 
future happiness. To him, it was then a land wherein 
was to be realized all that was lovely all that was desira 
ble of earth a land of freemen, with whom was the 
abode of peace. Then, he was in the noontide of man 
hood ; blessed with health and a competency beyond his 
wants. The smile of friendship, the marked and decorous 
respect with which he was met, the welcome greeting 
all gave evidence of lasting enjoyment. But how mys 
terious are the dispensations of Providence toward the 
children of men ! He had lived long enough to see every 
one of those bright hopes perish ; his fortune had been 
lost ; his health most seriously impaired ; and, to fill the 
measure of unhappiness, he was branded, by public opin 
ion, with a design of overthrowing the liberties of that 
government which had allured him across the Atlantic. 
These were reflections gloomy in the extreme, and still 



NO HOPE. 587 

the future was not less cheerless. As the green fields of 
his native isle hroke upon his view, how like the Prodigal 
Son, who had spent his substance in a foreign shore, did 
he return to his fatherland. But for him, alas ! there 
was no " plenty and to spare ; " no fatted calf was killed ; 
no fond embrace of anxious friends. In the long space 
of twenty-five years, how many changes had served to 
break the ties which bound him to his childhood's home ! 
As again he trod the fields of his former sports, memory 
turned, with melancholy tenderness, to those boon com 
panions of his earlier years. Where, alas ! were they ? 
Nought now remained to identify him with the past; 
and he stood a stranger on his native land ! 

On the next day after his arrival in Ireland, he called 
upon his solicitor, Mr. Berwick, the gentleman referred 
to in the letter of Mr. Emmett, to consult with reference 
to the Bawn estate, then in the possession of Lord Ross, 
ci devantj Oxmantown.* But Dean Harman had been 
dead for more than twenty years, and Blennerhassett's 



* Lord Ross was formerly Sir Laurence Parsons, and was an able and 
eloquent advocate of Emancipation in the Irish House of Commons. He 
was not less a poet than an orator. Some effusions from his pen have 
found their way into, the standard history of his country, and are much 
admired by his partisans, the United Irishmen. The following lines, from 
his pen, are selected from " Wolfe Jones's Memoirs : " 

" How long, Slavery ! shall thine iron mace 
Wave o'er this isle, and crouch its abject race? 
Full many a dastard century we 've bent 
Beneath thy terrors, wretched and content. 

" What though with haughty arrogance and pride 
England shall o'er this long-duped country stride, 
And lay on stripe on stripe, and shame on shame, 
And brand to all eternity its name ?"

claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Besides, 
Lord Ross was both wealthy and influential, and was not 
disposed either to deliver up possession or suggest a 
compromise. 

Blennerhassett, on leaving Quebec, having inclosed his 

will to his wife, she responded as follows :

Nay. ten times more ; and then for more still pray ! 
What State in something would not foremost be? 
She strives for fame, thou for servility."

ECONOMIZING. 589 

Mr. Dickenson made every exertion in his power for my 
accommodation. He then advised my coming to the 
neighborhood of Tew York, and mentioned this place or 
Greenwich. 

I therefore came to Mr. Emmett for further advice, and 
he thought this place would be best, and gave me a letter 
to the Professor of the Academy here, who has been 
very kind to me. I found boarding here very high, and 
therefore engaged two rooms in a farm-house, at three 
dollars a week, and have Harmaii* with me, who has 
not, nor is likely to get, employment ; and I find, after 
all the saving in my power, I can not maintain my two 
children, Mary and myself, under ten dollars a week, in 
cluding every thing. * * * * 
My dear kind friends, the Emmetts, have been my great 
est support. Could I tell you all the affectionate kind 
ness they have lavished on us, you would scarcely credit 
even me. Mrs. Emmett was not in town when I first ar 
rived, but came in next day to see me. We cried together 
a long time, and Mr. Emmett said we were so foolish he 
must leave us. I went out with them to the country, 
where I spent three days. I did not wish to stay so long, 
but Lewis was with me, and so delighted with the beauti 
ful place and all the attention he received, that I wished 
to indulge him ; besides, I found Mrs. Emmett's advice 
and consolation acted powerfully in restoring me to some 
tranquillity; for never in my life have I been so com 
pletely wretched as since I parted from you. She would 
not hear of my doing any thing in the way of gaining a

livelihood while any prospect remained of your prefer 
ment, but cheered me with hopes of your success. They 
were then preparing to go on a visit to Potsdam, to their 
daughter ; but Harman has seen them since, and told 
them of my present plan, which they highly approve. 

It is this : on finding what my expenses, at the lowest 
calculation, amounted to here, I wrote to my sister to let 
me know what we could get boarding for in Wilksbarre, 
thinking, should you be detained any time, I might there 
make out much longer than here. To this letter, written 
a fortnight since, I have just received an answer. Sister 
is delighted, and has engaged boarding at two dollars for 
me and one for Lewis,* per week. As for Mary, I do n't 
know what they will charge ; for, intending to persuade 
her to find a place here, I never mentioned her, and now 
find it impossible to get rid of her. She positively de 
clares she will never leave me, nor suffer me to pay a 
dollar for her traveling expenses ; she agrees only to let 
me pay for her board, as she thinks my washing would 
cost me as much. 

Mr. D. wrote to me to get Mr. Emmett to address a 
recommendation to the Secretary of War for Harman ; 
but no answer has been returned, and, from all accounts, 
there are too many applicants for West Point to expect 
success. Poor fellow ! he is one of the best children, 
and the kindest of brothers. He managed Dominick as 
if he had been an old man, and now labors hard in 
teaching Lewis; so he will not forget what he already 
knows. You would be delighted to hear the Emmetts

praise him. Mrs. Emmett took me up to the top of the 
house to show me the room she had prepared for him 
when first he came, and complained of his not taking it. 
Young Swartwout overpowers him with kindness, and 
is, like many others, endeavoring to get him some em 
ployment. We shall set out for AVilksbarre in a few days.

from the bay ; and on a still night, when I could not sleep, 
but listened to the roaring of the sea, O ! it was dreadful. 
Poor Dominick, perhaps he is yet on it. God help me ! 
I have lived too long, indeed, yet I still hope to be pre 
served to meet you again; and could I render the re 
mainder of your life happy, what matters all the present 
sufferings I undergo. 

Your affectionate wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT. 

As the biography of Blennerhassett is peculiarly en 
hanced in interest by his association with this most 
devoted companion, my readers will pardon a digression 
which relates more exclusively to herself. 

After the departure of her husband for Europe, Mrs. 
Blennerhassett, with two of her sons, Harman and Lewis, 
visited her sister, a Mrs. Dow, then residing at Wilks- 
barre, Pennsylvania, where she remained until December, 
1822. The separation from her husband, the limited 
state of her finances, and the absence of her eldest son, 
who was then in the South, and exposed to the diseases 
of the tropics, had contributed to produce a state of de 
spondency from which she found it difficult to rally. To 
add to her already overburdened distress, she received 
information of the arrival in Kew York of her unfortu-

nate child, who had returned from Savannah, wrecked in 
health, from an attack of yellow fever, and a penniless 
wanderer in the streets of that crowded metropolis. He 
had been liberally educated, and had prepared himself for 
the practice of surgery. But through the indulgences of 
his youth, he had contracted habits of dissipation, and 
proved utterly incapable either of aiding his unfortunate 
parents or of providing for his own necessities. The sad 
history of her erring first-born son is thus feelingly 
related by a mother, with whom many an aching heart 
may mingle a sigh of sympathetic sorrow : 

From Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

NEW YORK, March I2th, 1823. 

MY EVER DEAR HUSBAND : Your letter of the 29th of 
August, the first I have received since you sailed from 
Quebec, brings with it sensations I can not describe. 
After the dreadful despondency 'I have endured, for a 
period longer than I could have ever conceived myself 
capable, so extreme has been my wretchedness, that I 
have often conceived myself sinking into a state that 
promised a speedy termination of my sorrows : yet, as 
often have I rallied again, and struggled against such 
forebodings for the sake of my darling Lewis alone. 
Another thing that has caused me more recently to hope, 
was a communication from Mr. Dow, saying that he had 
learned, by a letter from B. Stafford, that you had left 
Ireland, and was in London, prosecuting a suit against 
Lord Ross, in which it was generally thought you would 
be successful. Here was, then, the dreadful fear of your 
death removed, and though I had no idea that fortune 



BOARDING. 593 

would ever again smile upon us, at least to any great 
extent, I thought the celebrity of such a suit might be 
favorable to your prospects in Canada. 

I have only written once since my letter from Flatbush, 
not knowing afterward where to direct. I remained at 
Wilksbarre from the last of August to the 2cth of De 
cember, when I was induced to come here, partly by the 
hope of being more in the way of receiving your letters, 
the cross mails being very uncertain, and partly, if pos 
sible, to save poor Dominick ; but I will not anticipate. 

I wrote you that he had sailed for Savannah ; and, 
endeavoring to discard him from my thoughts, I went 
with Harman and Lewis to "Wilksbarre. I placed the 
former with Doctor Covel, a skillful and worthy Yankee, 
who paid him great attention without, as yet, demanding 
any remuneration ; the latter had the benefit of a good 
country school, which he attended regularly. Mary re 
sided with my sister, Mrs. Dow, where she did enough to 
pay for her board, and washed for us. I obtained board 
for the boys and myself at six dollars per week ; this 
agreed with my finances, and I willingly endured the 
canting and vulgarity of the people of AVilksbarre for 
such advantages. But after getting my mind composed 
on Dominick's account, having received two letters from 
Savannah, saying he was doing well, his correspondence 
suddenly ceased. Some ten weeks elapsed, when I re 
ceived another from New York, announcing his arrival 
there in the most deplorable condition, after having 
escaped, as he expressed it, burying his bones in the 
sands of Savannah, where he had had a long and re 
peated attack of yellow fever. His life had been saved 
38 



594 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

by a friendly physician ; but his protracted confinement 
had involved him so in debt, that, when scarcely able to 
walk, he shipped himself privately for New York, rather 
than be taken to die, as he must certainly have done, in 
jail. He had given his clothes and books to defray his 
passage to New York ; and, but for the humanity of an 
Englishman, who is the keeper of a small tavern here, 
might have lain down to rest in the streets of the city. 
I wrote to Robert Emmett to give him twenty dollars out 
of my half-year's dividend I had ordered to be paid to 
him, with which request he complied, and answered me, 
saying that his embarrassments prevented him from offer 
ing money, though Dotoinick had not communicated to 
him his necessities. Afterward, I received another com 
munication from D., stating that he had determined no 
longer to be a burden to me; that he had gone to the 
]STavy-Yard, to enlist as a common marine, in hopes that, 
by good conduct, he might be appointed to a good posi 
tion in the hospital; but that on being referred to the 
surgeon for examination, he was rejected, in conse 
quence of the critical condition of his health. Mr. Em 
mett had previously written me that D. was much 
improved, and that he yet hoped he might do well. I 
dreaded his enlisting, though the surgeon, on inquiring 
his name, advised him against it, and promised his in 
fluence in having him appointed as an assistant; and, 
though well aware you will blame me, I could not rest 
while his fate was so doubtful; but, in dreadful weather, 
over the roughest roads, we set out, and reached this on 
Christmas Eve. Robert Emmett was conducting me to 
their house, when Dorninick espied me, and hid, rather 



CONSULTATION. 595 

than excite my feelings in the street. 'T was well he 
did ; for the next morning, when he came to me at Mr. 
E.'s, his appearance was shocking beyond all description. 
It gave me, however, consolation to know that my timely 
appearance prevented his enlistment; for, on that very 
day, he had resolved to do so, as the only means of 
escaping starvation. He said he was quite restored ; but 
such restoration I never saw. When I witnessed my once 
dear child's situation, I felt, indeed, that I had lived too 
long. I dismissed the poor fellow with a trifle to aid his 
most pressing wants, not wishing him to return to the 
military station at Brooklyn, where, for some days, he 
had been assisting in the hospital, and living with the 
common soldiers. After consulting with my friends, Mr. 
and Mrs. Emmett, I wrote to Colonel Henderson, at 
Washington, who commands the corps, and in a few days 
received one of the most generous arid gratifying answers 
that I could have desired. He said that to have an oppor 
tunity of obliging where he owed obligations never to be 
forgotten, gave him real pleasure ; that he had taken my 
letter to the Secretary of War, and obtained the promise 
of an appointment, as surgeon's assistant, for my son, in 
Commodore Porter's Expedition, which was to sail in a 
short time ; requested me to lose no time ; and, as you 
were absent, solicited me, in the most generous manner, 
to draw on him for any sum I deemed necessary for Dom- 
inick's outfit. I showed this letter to Mr. and Mrs. 
Emmett, and, of course, not choosing to incur a pecu 
niary obligation, and as Dominick's reformed habits jus 
tified my doing the best I could for my child, we agreed 
that T ought to sell a share of my bank stock, which was 



596 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

accordingly done ; and, after the necessary clothing, with 
money sufficient to bear his traveling expenses to Wash 
ington, I bid him farewell, with more extatic happiness 
than I conceived myself capable of experiencing under 
my gloomy apprehensions as to yourself. Col. Henderson 
having requested me to send him directly to his house, 
where, I am told, he lives in very genteel style, on Dom- 
inick's arrival, received him as kindly as his own son, and 
wrote me immediately to assure me of Dominick's safety, 
and of the expected sailing of the expedition in a few 
days. 

I heard no more from D. for a week, when you may 
guess my astonishment on his entering my room like an 
apparition. To tell you what passed is useless, but I 
gathered from him enough to convince me that by the 
return of his old habits he had completely disgusted Col. 
Henderson, who had given him thirty dollars to bring 
him back to his most unfortunate mother. I gather from 
Dominick, that he received a severe reprimand from the 
Colonel, who yet assured him that if he would give him 
his word that he would never again so far forget himself 
as to get intoxicated, he should still go in the expedition. 
Dominick's answer was that he could not answer for 
himself. Thus ended the business, and thus am I bur 
dened with this unfortunate child, whose existence I 
will prolong, while my own lasts, whether you gain an 
independence, or I am obliged to retire to a situation 
which, however humble, will yet afford me the means of 
giving him bread ; and which I now no more expect him 
to gain himself than I should do had it pleased God to 
bring him an idiot into the world. My obligations, in 



FAMILY DISTRESS. 597 

that event, could not be greater to maintain him than it 
is at present ; indeed, the most hopeless idiot has no 
more claims on a mother's care and solicitude than he ; 
for I firmly believe he has no longer the power to refrain 
from drink ; and did I not guard him, even to the pres 
ervation and custody of his own clothes, he would be 
stripped at once ; yet he is to me as docile as a lamb, and 
I have placed him with a poor but excellent woman, who 
boards him for three dollars and a half a week. I can 
not trust him with money, though certainly there never 
was a more devotedly affectionate son. Harman feels 
just as I do, and were I on my death-bed I should not 
fear to resign to him the care of his unfortunate brother. 
* * * * Should you return next month, 

as your letter to Mr. Emmett mentions, I shall hope we 
may return to Canada. If your expectations are suffi 
ciently encouraging to detain you in London on this law 
writ, and should you be successful even in gaining a fair 
compromise, I trust we shall soon be able to go to you ; 
for, let our situation be what it may, never can I think 
of ending my days in this country. Mr. Emmett is in 
"Washington, but Mrs. E. showed me your letter, which 
she will retain until his return, which is expected in a 
fortnight. To tell you how I love this family would be 
impossible. It grieves me, therefore, to say that I think 
they are somewhat embarrassed, at present, in their cir 
cumstances. They lost their fine son, Temple,* last 
autumn, who died of the yellow fever, on board of the 
Macedonian. ***** *

Temple and Robert.

I have written a long letter, that you may never re 
ceive ; hut I trust, if not, you will he on the water on 
your return. My mind seems huoyed up now for hap 
piness, and whether poverty or affluence awaits us, every 
effort of my declining years shall be used to make yours 
pass with as little uneasiness as can he expected to await 
on old age and disappointed hopes. For my part, for 
upward of eight months, I have endured too much to 
look forward without hope to the future that will restore 
you to 

Your affectionate, M. BLENNERHASSETT. 



From Col. Archibald Henderson to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

WASHINGTON, Jan. 7#A, 1823. 

MY DEAR MADAM : I do not know when I have received 
a letter which has conveyed to my mind such strong rec 
ollections of mingled pleasure and pain. It has irre 
sistibly carried me hack to the period when, under your 
hospitable roof, I received every attention of hospitality 
and kindness ; it was my debut in life. I have often 
spoke, and far often er thought, of the halo that was 
thrown over my monotony of existence, in that wild 
country, by my visits at the beautiful and isolated spot of 
your former residence. I must, however, cease to write 
on this subject. As long as my heart beats and feels, I 
shall never forget your kindness ; I therefore need not 
say with how much alacrity and anxiety I took your let 
ter to the Secretary of the Navy, and how much pleasure 
it gives me to communicate to you that he has the good- 



FRIENDSHIP. 599 

ness to consent that Dorriinick may go, as a volunteer 
surgeon's mate, in this piratical expedition, with the usual 
pay and emoluments. No appointments can be now 
made, and the Secretary of the Navy will not pledge 
himself as to any future appointment; I therefore hope, 
my dear madam, you will he satisfied with what has been 
procured. I spoke to Mr. Dickinson on the subject last 
night ; he will enforce all future arrangements. 

Dominick had better come here as soon as possible, 
and bring his trunk to my house. As Mr. Blennerhas- 
sett is away, I hope I may take the liberty, which grati 
tude for former kindness now induces me to take, to offer 
my young friend any assistance Ije may require in com 
ing on to Washington, and any draft for that purpose, I 
hope he will not hesitate to make on me. I trust you 
will excuse me if I feel over-anxious ; 't is my gratitude 
alone. that prompts it. 

I now conclude, assuring you that I feel every solici 
tude in serving you and yours, and I beg you to believe 
me, with gratitude and truth, 

Sincerely yours, ARCH. HENDERSON. 



Col. Archibald Henderson to Mrs. Blennerhassett. 

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20th, 1823. 

MY DEAR MADAM : Dominick arrived a few days ago, 
and is awaiting the arrival of Captain Porter, who is 
daily expected here to proceed on the service that has 
been marked out for him. It is fortunate some little 
delay has taken place, as he is somewhat indisposed from 



600 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

the fatigue of traveling, and will not prevent his joining 
the expedition on which he is to proceed. 

I should have sooner answered your kind letter of the 
llth, but thought it better to wait until he had left me 
for Norfolk ; but as that may not be the case for several 
days, I have concluded to write lest you might feel some 
anxiety at not hearing. 

Your indisposition, I hope, may be evanescent. You 
rate entirely too high the trifling service it has been in 
my power to do you. It is indeed trifling when compared 
with that received by me from you and yours. I shall 
carry the recollection of it with me "to that bourn 
whence no traveler returns." I am much of a wanderer 
still, and I may yet hope to meet you in this world. 
Should Mr. B. still reside in Canada, I shall probably see 
you next summer, as I have it in contemplation to de 
scend the lakes to Montreal. This world, however, is 
full of change ; it may therefore be our fate never again 
to meet here, but I sincerely wish that your decline of 
life may be less checkered than its spring and summer 
have been ; that it may be rendered happy, and that the 
scions which are growing up around the parent tree, may 
invigorate, support and comfort it, until it is cut down 
by the same hand that planted and caused it to grow. 

I will write again when Dominick leaves me, and, in 
the mean time, beg you to believe me with sincere regards 
Yours, A. HENDERSON. 

In a subsequent letter, dated Montreal, September 12th, 
1823, Mrs. Blennerhassett continues her narrative : 

I had no money, having for some weeks paid my way 



PARENTAL REGRET. 601 

by borrowing from Mr. Emmett ; because, having looked 
for you by the spring ships, I wished not to encumber 
the Montreal bank stock. The whole expenses of the 
family stood me in about sixteen dollars per week. I 
found I could do nothing in the States, arid, upon the 
advice of Rossiter, concluded to return to Montreal. The 
Emmetts, with whom I consulted, agreed with me as to 
the propriety of the measure ; for New York was then 
becoming objectionable, on account of the extreme heat, 
and they were about removing to the country. They 
having invited me to accompany them, I accepted their 
kindness, and did so, taking Lewis with me, to remain a 
week. Before leaving, however, I told Dominick that 1 
must now think of his father, who had nothing, and of 
the other children, and that he must maintain himself. 
Having remained a week in the country, where every 
attention was paid me by the family in the most affec 
tionate manner, I returned to the city. Having received 
the money for two shares of m}^ bank stock, which 
Robert sold, I paid my debts, and leaving Harman with 
my necessary baggage, and money sufficient to maintain 
him until your arrival, my last severe task yet remained 
to see and bid adieu to my unfortunate, though still 
dearly loved son. Harinan sought him out, and found 
him already enlisted ! brought him to me at the Steam 
boat Hotel, dressed in a common soldier's garb, but quite 
happy and unconcerned. O God ! had I been guilty of 
the greatest crime, the punishment of that moment 
ought to have expiated it ; but the subject is too painful 
to dwell upon; I will only add, that he went with a de 
tachment up the Mississippi, and is now, I believe, acting 



602 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

as surgeon's mate, and, as yet, I have received no com 
munication from him.* 

Lewis and I had a safe, and, had I been happy, an 
agreeable journey. At Albany we received the kind 
attentions of Major Smith and family, and arrived at La 
Prairie, where we awaited our friend Rossiter, to whom 
I had previously written to have lodgings prepared for 
us. Having remained here during the night, and Ros 
siter failing to arrive as early as I expected, we crossed 
over without really knowing where we should go. But 
he met us on the bank, on his way to us, and conducted 
us to the residence of Mrs. Turnstall, who had insisted 
on my stopping with her. Her reception was truly affec 
tionate, and seemed quite hurt that I would not consent 
to remain longer than two days. Rossiter accompanied 
me to see several houses which he had examined, but 
would not engage until I came. I, after some hesitation, 
finally fixed upon the one I am now in. It was in bad 
order, but has attached to the lot a good garden, which 
to me, who desire to live retired, is the greatest acquisi 
tion. The rent being but 20 per year, determined me to 
fix myself here rather than in a lodging where boarding 
for Lewis and myself could not be obtained for less than 
ten dollars per week. You know that I must have one 
servant any how, and one is all that I have now. Mar 
keting is cheap, being now lower by half than when you 
were here. But, after all, the prospect of having a home, 

* This unfortunate youth afterward was found in a state of destitution 
in the streets of New Orleans, by Nathaniel Cox, Esq., an acquaintance 
of the family, who procured for him a situation in the Charity Hospital, 
as assistant apothecary. He remained for a short time, when he left for 
St. Louis, since which his fate is unknown. 



ANXIETY. 603 

though ever so humble, to receive you, was the chief 
inducement to my determination. This, however, like 
all my visions of hope, has faded. I see plainly that you 
are never to return here ; nor can I say that I would wish 
it, unless as a judge, for I am well assured that you would 
not again get practice as a lawyer, the idea having be 
come prevalent that you are not versed in French law. I 
fear there is no chance for your promotion to the judge- 
ship, unless the Marquis of Anglesey would write to Lord 
Dalhousie for his recommendation to Lord Bathurst, as I 
am well informed that all recommendations must pro 
ceed, in the first instance, from the Commander-in-chief, 
and I fear the interest of Sir J. Gordon Sinclair may not 
be enough with the Governor, as he and the Richmond 
faction were at variance. I wish, therefore, that you 
would make this last effort with Lord Anglesey, as I 
firmly believe it is the only one that can serve you. 
Should it fail, then turn your thoughts to something at 
home, I care not what, if it will only furnish us bread. 
But to be parted from you I can not longer bear ; and if 
being with you should have the effect of injuring either 
your interest or reputation, then let me be lodged some 
where in obscurity, where I may sometimes see you ; and, 
in the event of Lewis's being in the navy, give me the 
chance of seeing and hearing from him occasionally. 

As to your coming in December, 't is utterly out of the 
question ; and should you, to my surprise, obtain the 
appointment you seek, it can not be before next June. 
We must winter here at all events, during which time I 
hope to hear from you again. My situation at present is 
alarming. I have only six shares remaining in bank, 



604 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

after the utmost economy. 'T is true I have furnished 
my house, though humbly, and paid three months rent 
in advance, and have also one hundred dollars by me; 
but what is this? I had resolved, before I received your 
letter, to commence, at the expiration of the term now 
paid for, in a larger dwelling, and keep a boarding-house, 
which, from the reduced rents, cheap markets, and high 
rate of board, might have, at least, maintained us, if it 
did not prove profitable. But now I can not degrade 
myself while their is a hope remaining of your success. 

I have been treated with the greatest attention by all 
our former acquaintances, and visited a great deal, but, 
of course, do not entertain, nor is it expected of me ; 
while a few friends call without ceremony, and I assure 
you I am now so pleased with Montreal, that could you 
return I would never wish to leave it. * * * 

* * ****** 

To say how ardently Lewis loves you is impossible. 
Your very name fills the dear creature's eyes with tears. 
Though the first mention of his going into the navy gave 
him great delight, still the thought of leaving me caused 
him much pain. By degrees, however, I have gained his 
consent, and although he has long been, and is still, my 
greatest consolation, I nevertheless will give him up to 
one whom I feel worthy of the trust. Tell H., then, he 
shall have him. 

Could he see me at the moment I write the fiat that will 
tear me from my idolized child, while memory reverts to 
the days of his own infancy, when, with my dear aunt 
and uncle De Coursey, I passed many a happy day in 
the same house with him and dear little Michael (Ann 



HARDSHIPS. 605 

was not born at Reese), I say, could lie, or any of those 
friends who fondly recall me to their recollection, but see 
my present suffering, what a flood of sympathy would 
overwhelm me ! But I am glad they do not ; it is better 
that I suffer alone. My dear aunt Avice ! how joyfully 
would I watch over her feeble health, and share with her 
the cares and anxieties for the sick and suffering Ad 
miral ! I was much gratified to hear from you that she 
intends writing; but am I still to be an exile? 'T is 
hard ; and if my present afflictions continue, I feel that 
I can not long live. * * * * 

* * * ***** 

Farewell ! I am perfectly miserable at this long sepa 
ration. When, when will it ever end? 
Your affectionate wife, 

MARG'T BLENNERHASSETT 

In the mean time, Blennerhassett, having abandoned 
the hope of recovering the estates in Ireland, set him 
self industriously to work to procure an office under the 
English Government. From the correspondence which 
follows, it appears that, such were his necessities, he was 
willing to accept almost any position promising subsist 
ence for his family. He had been severed from his former 
pursuits ; his fortune entirely expended ; and now, a waif 
upon the sea of life, he shuddered to look forward to the 
future, while the past was a troubled dream of disap 
pointed expectation. The hour, however, had arrived for 
a sublime but terrible contest for existence. To falter 
were to perish; to be resolute, perchance victorious. 
Connected with the then-existing Government, were

many of his early classmates, and several distinguished 
dignitaries, related by the ties of consanguinity ; from the 
latter of whom, at least, he conceived he had the right to 
expect promotion. From a mass of correspondence of 
the same character, during a period of several years, I 
have selected the following letters as conveying an intel 
ligible idea of his struggles and reverses, as well as of 
those with whom fate had linked his destiny: 

To the Marquis of Anglesey.* 

LONDON, October I6th, 1822. 

MY LORD : I beg to accompany the letter, intended 
to be communicated to Lord Bathurst, according to 
your Lordship's obliging suggestions, made to me at 



* The Marquis of Anglesey, who was born in 1768, was eldest son of the late 
Earl of TJxbridge; and, after studying at Oxford, was appointed, in 1793, 
when Lord Paget, to the command of a regiment he had raised among his fa 
ther's tenantry. He served with this corps, under the Duke of York, in Flan 
ders, and again in the British expedition to Holland, in 1799. He had risen 
to the rank of Major-General, when he joined Sir John Moore's army in the 
Peninsula, and assisted in the retreat of Corunna and the battle there, 
January 16, 1809, where Moore was killed. He was married, in 1795, to 
a daughter of the Earl of Jersey, by whom he had eight children; but, 
soon after his return from Portugal, figured as defendant in a crim. con. 
suit, in which the plaintiff was Wellesley, brother to "the Duke," and 
created Lord Cowley, in 1828. who recovered twenty thousand pounds 
sterling damages. The result was, a double divorce : Lady Paget from 
him (she afterward married the late Duke of Argyle), and Mr. Wellesley 
from his guilty wife, ne Lady Charlotte Codogan. Lord Paget married 
the frail fair in 1810, and they had a large family ; two of their sons were 
members of the British House of Commons, in 1854. The trial and its reve 
lations gave much unenviable notoriety to Lord Paget. He is alluded to 
by Byron in the line, 

" And, worst of all, a Paget for your wife ; " 

and Moore, albeit little of a moralist, thus had his fling, in a didactic poem 
called " The Sceptic," a philosophical satire :

Beau Desert, on the 10th inst., with an explanation of 
the motives that urged rne to resort to the severe neces 
sity of leaving my family in America for the purpose of 
personally soliciting your Lordship's interest in behalf 
of my labors to serve the Government, as you had made 
one already, without effect, to recommend me to the Colo 
nial Department. 

The proud distinction of your Lordship's patronage 
once conferred upon me, although unsuccessful, sunk 
deep into the grateful hearts of an embarrassed family, 



" Paget, who sees upon his pillow laid 
A face for which ten thousand pounds were paid, 
Can tell how quick, before a jury, flies 
The spell that mocked the warm seducer's eyes." 

Many years subsequently, when he had become Viceroy of Ireland, 
the Irish ladies declined visiting his wife; and having caused the 
arrest of O'Connell, on a charge of seditious language, the orator, in 
another speech, said : " He has caused my wife to weep. Does he 
know the value of a virtuous woman's tear?- In 1812, -Lord Paget 
succeeded his father as Earl of Uxbridge. He had a cavalry command 
at Waterloo; and having lost a leg, was created Marquis of Anglesey. 
In 1820, he voted for the bill of Pains and Penalties against Queen Caro 
line. In February, 1828, " the Duke," who had just become Premier, sent 
him to Ireland as Viceroy ; and his conduct there was generally impartial. 
But in December, 1828, having received a letter from Dr. Curlis, the Cath 
olic Primate, which the Duke of Wellington had written to him, suggesting 
that the Catholic claims be " buried in oblivion" for a time, Lord Anglesey 
wrote back an epistle, which was published, recommending the continued 
agitation of the question. This gave great offense to George IV, who had 
become tired of eternal discussion on Catholic wrongs, and the writer was 
recalled. Two months after, the final settlement of the question was rec 
ommended in the King's Speech at the commencement of the Parliament 
ary Session. Soon after, he was again made Viceroy of Ireland, and so 
continued until September, 1833. But his latter reign was not popular. 
He has held other high offices connected with the army, and was the Senior 
Field-Marshal in the British army, in 1854, then in his eighty-sixth year.

and shed a ray of cheering hope upon the gloom of their 
despondency that the generous impulse which had before 
determined your Lordship to desire that relief, would not 
now abandon their head, whose honor and character, 
however, stood as high as when they enjoyed your Lord 
ship's esteem in early life. 

The authority given to me to make my suit through 
your Lordship to Earl Bathurst, and the condescending 
attentions ordered to be shown to me at Beau Desert, 
fully confirm your Lordship's desire, at least, to benefit 
me. Under such auspices, I can not anticipate disap 
pointment; while, for myself, my views extend not be 
yond the acquisition of a pittance on which I could sub 
sist any where, after devoting the residue of my official 
salary to the maintenance of my family, if I could not 
remove them from Canada, where there is now a judicial 
vacancy in the District of Montreal. I would accept a 
situation in India, or any other part of the world, or even 
one I should dislike of all others, that of Assistant Bar 
rister of Quarter Sessions in Ireland, in preference of 
which I would as soon choose an agency to any estate 
that would maintain me. 

In so wide a range to seek employment, the generous 
disposition of your Lordship, already manifested, to assist 
me in Canada, can not fail to succeed, if exerted, while I 
am in the way to avail myself of the opportunity. Hence 
it is that I have left my family in the most painful anxiety 
to learn the result of my endeavors in England, of which 
a total failure would result in hopeless ruin. 

Having had an opportunity of knowing that a person 
in America, over whom I possess some influence, is about

to publish a volume under the title of " Secret Memoirs 
of her Serene Highness the Duchess of Quedlinburg," a 
near relative of his Majesty, containing original letters 
of rather a scandalous character, addressed to a Col. Staf 
ford, Chamberlain to the Duke of Brunswick, of the first 
eight of which I have copies here, a publication which 
probably the King would not wish to appear, I had 
thought it my duty to engage the proprietor of these 
letters to suspend his intended publication until I could 
endeavor to ascertain the King's pleasure on the subject. 
Presuming your Lordship will approve of the principle 
of loyal concern for his Majesty's fame, for which I have 
interfered in this matter, I beg your Lordship's direction 
to guide me in controlling the proprietor of these letters, 
or leaving him to take his course. The copies in my pos 
session are, if desired, at your Lordship's orders. The au 
thenticity of the whole can be established, and an English 
translation is intended, with the French originals annexed. 
I beg to apologize for having so long trespassed upon 
your Lordship's leisure ; and with assurances of the most 
profound esteem and heartfelt gratitude, pray to be con 
sidered, my Lord, 

Your Lordship's faithful and obedient servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 



To JBlennerhassett. 

MONTREAL, January 3d, 1824. 

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Let me flatter myself that, hav 
ing, as I hope, received my last two letters, written since 
39 



610 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

I received yours inclosing the gift from my aunt, this, 
penned at the commencement of a new year, may find 
you more cheerful than myself, though my situation is in 
no way changed, and we are all well. But, it having heen 
so long since we have heard from you, and dreading the 
delays of the approaching season, my spirits have become 
exceedingly depressed. You must not forget that if I am 
condemned to live separated from you, my only solace is 
in your frequent letters. If I am not permitted, as the last 
comfort of my declining life, to watch over yours, let me, 
at least, know that you are well, and I shall not murmur. 
I trust, therefore, you will not again condemn me to the 
anxieties of a six months' silence. 

My last letter was forwarded several days since, by New 
York, and I now avail myself of the opportunity of send 
ing, by Mr. David, the Jew, who sets out for London in 
two days, trusting that some of my letters, at least, may 
reach you. 

I am told here that any young man may get into 
the marines, through naval interposition ; and as a war 
seems approaching, and poor Harman has no prospect of 
a maintenance but what I may afford: him, I wish you to 
exert yourself among our relatives to accomplish this, if 
possible. Could we succeed in getting a situation for him, 
and should you fail in procuring one for yourself, we might 
still provide for the education of Lewis, so as to fit him 
in turn for some one of the useful occupations of life. If 
I have been misinformed as to the facilities of getting into 
the marine corps, I wish to be advised as to conditions 
under which an applicant can enter without such inter 
position as my kind friend, Mrs. T , would endeavor 



611 

to get her younger son into that service, and could I be 
lieve, if necessary, purchase in. If I have harbored false 
hopes for Harman, darken them at once rather than keep 
me in suspense. 

I have been very much alarmed, since I last wrote, for the 
fate of our friend Rossiter, who has been confined these last 
five weeks with a liver complaint, which brought him to 
the brink of the grave. He is now, however, nearly recov 
ered, although it will be some time before he can get out. 

5JI >****** 

By the time this reaches you I suppose our old friend 
Devereux will be in London. He is now in Washington, 
the received ambassador from the Colombian Republic. 
His laurels have been dearly won. I would give much 
to see him, but that is impossible. However, I think 
that, should you see his name announced in London, it 
might be worth while to go and see him, as he could cer 
tainly do something for Harman, should what I have 
before proposed fail. You know my disposition too well 
to wonder at the solicitude I feel for my child; and, even 
if my efforts should all prove fruitless, it will still be a 
cause of consolation to know that I have done all in my 
power to serve him. 

I have promised you some pleasing intelligence in my 
last two letters, which I hope and believe I shall soon be 
able to communicate ; but the time for it has not yet 
arrived ; when it does, be assured that no pleasure could 
be much to me without your participation. 

The winter here is very severe ; but I find so much 
more comfort than I did last season, in Kew York, that, 
while I can live, I will not repine, and trust you will fol- 



612 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

low my example. Say every thing for me to my dear 
friends who kindly interest themselves in my behalf. 
God only knows whether ever again I shall see them or 
be permitted to enjoy any friendship, other than that of 
strangers, yet for this I am not unthankful. There are 
some of these, even, who are unremitting in their kind 
ness. While from what is called society, that is, parties, 
I am excluded, as I must necessarily be, both from my 
situation and inclinations, yet, I am seldom alone, and 
continue to take exercise enough for health, as severe as 
the season is. This is the first winter for nine years that 
I have escaped a cold, or have not suffered from a return 
of my breast complaint. It is certainly cause for thank 
fulness, as a similar attack to that of last winter would 
rob my dear Lewis of his only protection. 

Adieu ! my dear husband. Take care of yourself, and 
some happiness may yet be in store for 

Your wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT. 



To Nev. de Courcy. 
(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.) 

STOKETON HOUSE, March 29^, 1824. 

MY DEAR NEV. : How fully I am persuaded your anx 
iety to serve me is solicitous to consider the best means 
of availing yourself of such opportunities to do so, as 
this, your second visit to Portugal, may offer, I will leave 
to futurity to evince through the grateful affection of a 
distressed family, whose head is already devoted to you. 
If, therefore, you have acceded to my wish in accepting 



POLITICS. 613 

the offer I have made you, to put on paper my views of 
the best means of succeeding for me, you will not im 
agine that in so doing I have any purpose, either to 
stimulate your zeal or to induce you t ) substitute my 
judgment and policy for your own, in scenes and circum 
stances of which you will be able to judge on the spot, 
but which I can only estimate through, perhaps, a delu 
sive medium at a distance. If the suggestions I am 
about to present to you should be sanctioned by the 
results of your own observation, or modified by the char 
acters and circumstances that you will be concerned with, 
an occasional review of the former may not, however, be 
quite useless as a sort of chart on which you may prick 
off your course, not so much by the bearings and dis 
tances I have set down, as by the winds and currents of 
party and intrigue you may be affected by in the voyage. 

Without further preamble, then, I conceive the means 
of effecting my introduction into the civil service of the 
Portuguese Government can only be obtained through 
the patronage of the actual minister, whether Pampeluna 
or any other. "Without such a passport it will be in vain 
to linger in the confidence which even the King's prom 
ises may inspire, or the assurances his other courtiers 
may profess ; the former can never be realized without 
the fiat of the minister ; the influence and sincerity of the 
latter must submit to the same test. 

The best affections of a monarch, situated as is John 
VI, must ever be confined to the royal breast, powerless 
and inert, until the minister shall become the conductor 
between them and the object to which they are directed. 
Hence arises the necessity of engaging the minister's in- 



614 THE BLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

terest, at a period early enough to prevent his suspicion 
of neglect. But upon what terms, i. e., through the in 
sinuation of what future return, on the part of the candi 
date, is the first question of either doubt or difficulty that 
presents itself? Kow, whatever may be your views or 
policy of the minister, I should not hesitate to pledge 
myself to espouse them all, subject to the proviso that 
nothing therein tended to the detriment of his Majesty. 
Ever alive to the influence of this sentiment, I should 
make no compromise, nor hold any interview with the 
party of the Queen or Don Miguel, even if I could in 
trigue for my object through their influence. But to a 
candidate, circumstanced as I am, there can be no great 
difficulty in choosing between the French and English 
parties at court, should such an election become neces 
sary. In the present state of Portugal, which, politically, 
if not commercially speaking, must, under continental 
contact, yield to the destinies of Spain, I could conscien 
tiously enlist under the banners of the shortest side, 
which I would endeavor accurately to ascertain before 
hand. So far this outline is made to include advances to 
foreign ministers, as well as Pampeluna, especially the 
French and Russian, whose interest ought, at the same 
time, to be early courted. When it is represented to all 
these personages that the candidate, who had already 
obtained some royal notice of the recommendation which 
the King has favorably received of him, is qualified as a 
jurist and a scholar to serve his Majesty in any diplo 
matic or judicial office; and you may add, if every thing 
else fails, as a forlorn hope, " in an ecclesiastical charac 
ter," that in Europe or America he would strenuously 



IN EXTREMIS ! 615 

and ably advance the best interest of his patrons in a 
diplomatic character, etc. 

I trust it is not too much to expect, that if your exer 
tions should overreach their farthest aim, they will not 
altogether fall short without reaching some intermediate 
point between total failure and success, where I may find 
myself once entered upon some station in which I may 
subsist until I can thence work out promotion. I will 
exemplify my meaning here by observing, that I should 
not deem it disparagement of the condition I derive from 
my ancestry and profession, of which even poverty must 
not divest me, to accept any situation, any where, not 
even excepting Angela, which was not beneath the rank 
of a consul or collector. As to location, my preference 
would be first in Europe, next in America, any where 
preferable to the United States, where, being obnoxious 
as a persecuted supporter heretofore of legitimate mon 
archy, I could not so easily fill all the duties of a diplo 
matic station. Should such an appointment be unattain 
able, you will next try to work out one in the law ; or if 
that fail too, then, finally, endeavor to obtain such an 
establishment in the Church as in its income would enable 
me to spare you two or three hundred pounds a year, 
after leaving me as much more on which to subsist. 
Kow, this is the only topic of this letter ; I wish you to 
regard it as inviolably confidential ; for, although I could 
as easily satisfy your reason and feelings as my own, that 
I should neither offend against the duties of true religion 
and morality, in accepting such a treasure, were it not 
even justified as the best effort I could make for a 
starving family ; yet how vain would the undertaking 



616 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

prove with others ! If, then, you should be reduced to 
the necessity of canvassing for me in a spiritual charac 
ter, you need not hesitate to say of me, " que vous un 
connaissez un bon Catholique." 

I will close this tiresome letter by begging of you to 
look at it occasionally, to remind you that the time draws 
near for my return to my family, " to live or starve to 
gether, as we can, for the remainder of our days ; " * but, 
until death shall relieve us of our wants, we shall ever 
cherish the most affectionate regards for you. This con 
sideration will suggest to you the expediency of giving 
me speedy intelligence of the result of your exertions on 
my behalf. 

And believe me, etc., HAR. B TT. 



To Lord Courtney. 
STOKETON HOUSE, SALTASH, April 15A, 1824. 

MY LORD : After the long lapse of years through 
which your lordship and myself have passed with the 
respective portions of happiness and misery each of us 
has experienced since the days of our juvenile friendship, 
when boarding together at Mrs. Clapham's, it will, I 
hope, be less matter of surprise than of satisfaction to 
you to learn that your old school-fellow, Blennerhassett, 
though hitherto silent, now takes the first opportunity of 
soliciting a revival of friendly intercourse by proposing a 
correspondence which may enable him to testify the acute 

* An expression in one of Mrs. B.'s letters to himself. 



TO AN OLD FRIEND. 617 

sense he has of the injuries which have so largely been 
unaccountably suffered to undermine your lordship's 
fame and just rights, in which no one has yet antici 
pated him in standing forward to vindicate. 

It is only since my late return from America, after an 
absence of near thirty years, that I have bee^n given to 
understand your lordship has, during so many years, 
been the victim of so much malice and self-interest, with 
out the aid of a protecting arm, to turn aside those of 
the moral assassins that have beset your fame, that they 
might thereby divest you of your property. Tow, to 
grapple with the ruffians, and oust them of whatever con 
trol they may have usurped over your mind and estate, I 
tender you, under the guarantee of our juvenile friend 
ships, my services as an experienced barrister, together 
with those offices of friendship which I am disposed to 
think you might require and return iji circumstances not 
incompatible with our respective stations in life. 

But I forbear troubling you with any thing like stipu 
lation, unless called upon to do so, after having proved 
the success of the efforts I would make to deserve your 
confidence, which, in the first instance, I may, in some 
degree, appreciate from the tenor of your answer. 

If I should join your lordship's society, I would ob 
serve, my habits are those of a literary man, though I 
easily accommodate myself to any mode of life, and am 
no less than I was in boyhood, an enthusiast in music, in 
which I have become a proficient. Your speedy answer 
will be anxiously looked for by, my Lord, 
Yours most faithfully, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.

To Blennerhassett. 

MONTREAL, May 19#A, 1824. 

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Your letter, conveying the melan 
choly tidings of our much-lamented Admiral's death, not 
unexpected, should have been answered sooner if the 
state of my mind had not made me dread that my writ 
ing might grieve you more than my silence. But I am 
now more tranquil, and am at a loss for appropriate 
words of condolence. Tell my aunt Mary that I deeply 
sympathize with her in her great affliction, and that the 
image of those virtues which shone forth in her noble 
husband's character are as fresh in my recollection as 
though I had seen him but yesterday. I sincerely hope, 
if you have not already, that you may prevail on my 
aunt Avis to remain near her sister, as this will be, for a 

time at least, her only consolation. * * * 

* * ###**# 

You can not surely remain from us forever. It would 
have been better that you had not elated me with the 
hope of prosperity ; but my disappointment is over now, 
and I can even console you. Our noble friend Rossiter 
wishes for nothing so much as joining you again in busi 
ness, of which he has more than he can attend to, and 
only forbears taking a partner in hopes of your return. 
I moved the day before yesterday into an excellent house, 
at 25 rent. It is the oie you may recollect, constructed 
of stone, in the rear of the house in which we lived. 

I am quite fatigued in body and mind ; the latter, as 
you know, always weak ; yet it has achieved more than 



DESPERATION. 619 

you would credit, did you know all.* But I will soon 
write again, and hope the April packet can not be far off. 
In the mean time, do 'nt be discouraged ; we may yet do 
well here in a moderate way ; and what more, at our time 
of life, is necessary ? As to your keeping a school, it is 
nonsense (pardon the expression) ; we shall never be 
driven to this ; and here, even if we were starving, it 
would be impossible. My six bank shares are untouched 
yet ; and if you return, or should send me 25, may so 
remain for a long time. I have a comfortable house, fur 
nished as w^ell as my necessities require ; and, with the 
assistance of a good maid-servant, get along comfortably. 
In short, therefore, be easy about me on every account 
but one, your continued absence ; this it is that breaks my 
heart ; and if it is suffered to continue, I may not last 
long. Thank ISTevison for me ; certainly, should I die, he 
shall have Lewis, now my only comfort. 

The boys are well ; Lewis progresses rapidly at school ; 
but, alas ! Harman is doing nothing but indulging him 
self in miscellaneous reading, and performing occasional 
errands. He says, on your return, he will go to the South 
ern States and teach. I have written to poor Dominick, 
but have received nothing from, or heard nothing of, him 
since last August, at which time he accompanied the 
troops to the head of the Mississippi. This is, indeed, a 
sad scroll ; do n't show it to any one. When I began it, 
I was calm, and thought I was brave ; but the subjects

Rock, and other Poems," which she was then publishing, and with which 
she desired to surprise her husband. 



620 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

that have constantly recurred have overcome me, and I 
am compelled to conclude. When I recover myself, which 
I hope will be in a few days, I shall commence a long sheet 
that will prove far more acceptable. 
God bless and preserve you ! prays 

YOUR AFFECTIONATE WlFE. 



To Blennerhassett. 

MONTREAL, June 27th, 1824. 

MY DEAR HUSBAND : Could I believe in the flattering 
hope of your embarking to return to us on the 1st of 
April, any answer to your welcome letter of the 1st and 
3d of May would be useless ; but, alas ! such and so mul 
tiplied have been my cruel disappointments on this score, 
that, until I see you, I shall almost despair of our ever 
meeting again. I look for letter after letter, still hoping 
the next I receive will end my doubts ; but every one that 
arrives only adds to my perplexity. 

If my last two have reached you, my riddle, as you call 
it, has been solved ; and, what is of more importance, you 
have an outline of a plan by which, if we can not live in 
affluence, we may yet subsist with independence here. 

All those little attentions paid me at first by many of 
the citizens of this community, seemed to have been with 
drawn, until the publication of my book, which, in a few 
instances, excited a renewal of them, and which I rejected ; 
holding it better to live in solitude than again subject my 
self to the capriciousness of those to whom T feel myself 
superior. The author of " The Widow of the Rock, and 



CALCULATIONS. 

other Poems," * will, therefore, receive no favor which was 
withheld from " Mrs. Blennerhassett." I live in utter soli 
tude ; but such has been the state of my health and spirits 
for some time past, that any society would have been in 
supportable. 
******** 

I rely on none of the prospects of your advancement 
you mention, save the poor chance there may be of a 
recommendation to a new Governor, if Dalhousie, who 
has gone home with his family, does not return. The 
papers say, but this is only conjecture, that he is to go 
out to India, and that both a civil and military governor 
will be sent to Canada. Heaven only knows how this 
may be; but, notwithstanding all the fuss a few toad- 
eaters made at his departure, the general impression seems 
to be, that he is a poor creature ; while the Canadian 
party can't tolerate him. 

I exceedingly dislike this place, but do not know 
where I can be better suited ; for, as to Portugal or its 
dependencies, I turn from them in horror ; such is the 
state of that country, the success might prove our destruc 
tion. "Where there is no principle, and parties constantly 
changing, what can the fallen expect but death or im 
prisonment? Though the climate of Brazil may be fine, 
in what situation would any appointment leave you there 
if, as would certainly be the case, the Government did 
not duly pay the salary ? It would be better to commit 
suicide at once, in my opinion, than to go to any other 
Portuguese colony; and as to having any thing to do

with the Church, that would be running into the lion's 
mouth. If any employment could he obtained under an 
English nobleman, it would be desirable, even though I 
should be doomed to seek a retreat in the Welsh mount 
ains, which I should much prefer to Scotland. But I 
expect nothing from this scheme, and again repeat, that 
I fear it is here alone we can hope to end our days without 
starvation. 

! I ask myself a thousand times what I can have 
done to deserve my present forlorn condition ? Did it 
spring from the grave, I could bear it as the lot of mor 
tality. But to be a wife and the mother of two grown 
sons, and yet feel alone in the world, is a situation which 
I sometimes wonder that I can sustain ; yet, poor Dom- 
inick, in the midst of his failings, was ever kind to me, 
and now that a year has elapsed without having heard 
from him, bears more sadly upon my heart than any 

thing else.

You can't remain much longer from, your affectionate 
wife, M. BLENNERHASSETT. 



To General Devereux. 
COTTAGE CRESCENT, BATH, May 8th, 1825. 

MY DEAR DEVEREUX: After the many trying vicis 
situdes of fortune two old friends have undergone during 
nineteen years that have rolled over them since they 
received that impressing regard for you which no length 
of time or change of circumstances can ever efface from 



INFERIOR TYPOGRAPHY. 623 

their hearts, your feelings will better suggest to you than 
I can describe the agreeable surprise with which we have 
just learned you are in London. 

Assuredly, the distance of a day's journey which sepa 
rates us, can not long impede any efforts I can make to 
effect our meeting, if I shall learn by your answer that 
you do not expect soon to visit Bath, and that business is 
likely to detain you in London, more especially law busi 
ness, in which I could devote to your interest the best 
efforts of my professional labor or advice. 

Mrs. B., now here with my sister, is in too delicate a 
state of health to permit her indulging the pleasure she 
would not fail to enjoy of accompanying me to town on 
such an occasion. Of the deep regret which she will en 
tertain, on conceiving the thought of not seeing you here, 
you will be the best judge, from the ardor of her mind 
which she lent to the best feelings of her heart in conse 
crating her sense of your worth and character, in the 
poetical address to you she published, last year, at Mon 
treal, called forth on the occasion of seeing in the papers 
your intended mission from Colombia to Russia, and in 
vindication of your character, which her best sympathies 
have covered with the segis of truth and friendship 
against the gorgon of calumny that would assail it. The 
volume, containing many other things that will not be un 
interesting, I will transmit you by the Bath coach, if you

I forbear to touch upon my present condition or future 
prospects until we meet, and shall only add, that I shall 
be most impatient to learn whether I shall further hasten 
to embrace you in town, or shall soon be more gratified 
to welcome you here, where you will accept of a bed.

To J. Kingdom, Esq. 
COTTAGE CRESCENT, June 25th, 1825. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : From the generous interest I know 
you feel in the success of my proposed plan of undertak- 

London publication of the poems was never effected. The address opens 
as follows : 

" From Chimborazo's lofty brow, 

Fame spreads her eagle wings for flight; 
A hero's name she echoes now, 

To thrill the soul with wild delight. 

" On Andes' peaks thy deeds now shine ; 
In Quito's halls are joy and mirth; 
Lov'd Erin's cause, for ever thine, 

Is linked with Freedom's 'round the earth. 

" Colombia now no more shall hear 
The soul's sad echo of distress; 
The tyrant's scourge no more shall fear, 
While BOLIVAR and THEE they bless. 

" Why weeps poor Erin thus in need 

Of souls like thine to soothe her tears ? 
Why not at FREEDOM'S call we speed 
To worship at the throne she rears?"

ing the instruction of two or three other lads concur 
rently with that of my son, you have ere now expected 
something in the nature of a prospectus to be submitted 
to your consideration. I shall now offer you a sketch of 
my views, in the hope of your favoring me with your un 
reserved judgment on the subject. 

Having, by my own experience and observation, fully 
proven the wasteful expense of time, money and constitu 
tion, to obtain school and academical instruction, and its 
defects, when acquired, I have no reason to regret that 
my present restricted circumstances determine me to dis 
pense, proprid persond, to my son that discipline of the 
head and heart, which I should despair of his attaining 
in a public seminary ; and which, for a reasonable com 
pensation, I would administer to a few others of similar 
age and amiable tempers. 

It would be with me a sine qua non that the best moral 
principles had been confirmed, and the temper generous 
and tractable, in any pupil I would undertake; such 
preliminary qualifications I can vouch for in Mr. Cresser 
and my own boy. With such dispositions I would 
keep up rather a companionable than a magisterial in 
tercourse. Expecting to receive them with good moral 
instincts, I should spare no pains to arrange and eluci 
date the analysis, as well as the synthesis of their ethics, 
which I regard as the best and most solid foundation 
of all the prosperity they may aim to attain, in whatever 
vocation they may be destined for. 

As to literary acquirements, the course and compass of 
them should be regulated by the profession we have in 
view ; for instance, I should hold it preposterous for a 
40

student of law to pore longer over the intricacies of 
mathematics than was necessary to enable him to apply 
them to an elementary course of physics. This I put as 
an example of the vigilance I would exert in the economy 
of time in the selection of matter. Meanwhile I should 
never lose sight of the necessary grounding, so frequently 
disregarded or neglected at all schools, except, perhaps, 
the Royal Foundations, in which last, I admit, young men 
acquire hy seven or eight years labor, a good grammar 
of the dead languages, with little or no love for the beau 
ties of the ancients, in the study of whom they are solely 
devoted to the almost total neglect of all other acquire 
ments. I can aver that, of the four hundred boys at 
Westminster school, when I was there, six could not be 
picked out who could deliver the principles of an opera 
tion in the Rule of Three. Such a waste of young life 
was more compatible with a monastic age than with the 
present. But the tyranny of fashion further exacts four 
years more of the flower of youth to be devoted to the 
college course ; for what benefit I know not, save so far 
as it may be requisite for a more respectable ordination ; 
but with what effects it visits the constitution and morals 
of its students, I suppose, is as generally felt and admitted, 
as is the great charge for the name, rather than the sub 
stance of any learning that is gained by it. The literary 
men of Alma Mater are really self-taught products of a 
second closet education, and only regard her as their 
boarding dame. Hence I propose, for my son, to dis 
pense with a public education, feeling as I do, that if God 
Almighty vouches health to me for three years to come, 
T shall in that time provide him with a viaticum for pur-

suing his journey toward the attainment, with credit, of 
whatever profession circumstances and his talents may 
best indicate. In three years, I beg to repeat, for any lad 
no less advanced than Lewis, I could supersede the neces 
sity of all school and University education, and fit him 
for such a course of study as in five years more would 
enable him to enter on the practice of any of the liberal 
professions as well gifted and qualified as any University 
scholar whatever. 

You perceive my plan, in the whole, embraces a period 
of eight years, of which the last five are to be appropri 
ated to a mixed course of the sciences, polite literature 
and professional study, to be arranged and digested on a 
scale adapted to the views, interests and intended voca 
tion of the individual. For instance, should the bar be 
his object, he is to spend half of his last year in a special 
pleader's oflice, three months of it in an attorney's, and 
the other three in a conveyancer's office, having, during 
the last five years, kept all his Terms at the Temple. 
For a military, naval or commercial calling, I would not 
undertake to propose further than by the first three years' 
course, which would embrace enough of French, Greek, 
Latin, English, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geography, Geom 
etry, Astronomy, and no more than I should deem requi 
site at the present day for any condition. Any other 
acquirements should be sought out in an after period by 
the individual. 

If boarding should be required, it could be procured at 
Cottage Crescent, by all comparisons the most healthful 
and pleasant situation, distant one and three-fourth miles

from Bath, at the lowest terms it could be furnished in a 
good family. The tone of the society and manners is 
such as may he expected in a domestic circle whose limits 
regard as their center a retired hamster, who is an LL. B., 
has traveled much, and practiced his profession with rep 
utation both in Europe and America. It is not, he flat 
ters himself, his least recommendation, that he avers he 
had no wish to grow rich by his labors in the decline of 
his life. His only aim is to give ample value for quantum 
meruitj while, by benefiting others, he can enlarge the 
rational comforts of his own family. In his estimates, 
which, however, he is willing to modify at your sugges 
tion, he submits, that he ought to receive 100 per annum, 
independent of boarding. If it should be thought I have 
spoken less reverently than I thought to have done, I 
would refer to the bill now before Parliament, constitut 
ing a Police System for the Universities. 

Yours faithfully, H. BLENNERHASSETT. 



To Devereux. 
COTTAGE CRESCENT, BATH, Aug. 31s, 1825. 

MY DEAR DEVEREUX : Perceiving by the papers that 
commercial intercourse with Colombia is connived at by 
France, which I have thought it probable may have 
arisen from the success of your efforts on the part of 
the Republic with the French ministry ; and if I am 
right in this conjecture, I may rejoice in your having 
been, at least, the proximate cause of that recognition 



TO DEVEREUX. 629 

which seems so generally expected to be made by the 
French Government. Should this soon take place, surely 
the services you have rendered the Republic, and the 
claims you have on Bolivar, can admit of no intervention 
between you and the Colombian Government, notwith 
standing your being a foreigner, to impede your filling 
any diplomatic situation in Europe you might choose to 
accept under the Republic. Might I, in such an issue of 
your exciting political speculations, suggest that, if your 
views are not already fixed, I will not say on some more 
attached, but more competent friend, I would be most 
happy to be appointed your secretary, in which character, 
I may venture to say, I hope my industry and acquire 
ments would not disappoint your expectations. To this 
application you will 'gratify me with an early answer. 
But en attendant, if you could, without inconvenience, 
procure me a consular appointment under the Colombian 
Government, or any agency worth even 200 per annum, 
in any situation in Europe, such an addition to our pres 
ent small income would make us comfortable any where 
near you; though, I confess, we should receive it with 
considerable alloy, if it were to depend on the condition 
of our residing out of Europe. 

I have nearly, but not quite, abandoned the project of 
resuming my profession in Ireland, which is not now the 
happy home of our " by-gone years." The scheme is beset 
with too many difficulties to promise success, with a detail 
of which I will not attempt to excite your sympathies. 

Mrs. B. has sanguine hopes that the suggestions I have 
presented to your friendship may open better prospects 
for us. She begs to close this letter ; so I will only add, 



630 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

I hope we shall soon learn where we may look for the 
happiness of embracing you ; being 

Ever, my dear Devereux, faithfully yours, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

P. S. We have just heard of a new work on the 
Colombian Revolution, with which we are impatient to 
meet, that we may follow the march of your fame. Apro 
pos de la marche, I have composed some military ones, of 
which I hope your Excellency will hereafter select one, to 
be enhanced by your accepting its dedication. 

MY DEAR SIR : I can not permit your friend's letter to 
go without offering you, under my own hand, an expres 
sion of the heartfelt pleasure I received by your kind let 
ter from London, the sentiments of which so entirely cor 
respond with those I have ever cherished, that I look 
forward to the period when we shall receive the pleasure 
we formerly so much enjoyed in your society ; not merely 
in your promised visit to us here, but in a more durable 
intercourse, if we shall ever be so fortunate as to realize 
the hope of sharing with you the evening of our days. 

With every solicitude for your health and happiness, I 
beg you to believe me, 

Your faithfully attached friend, M. B. 



To the Marquis of Wdlesley. 
COTTAGE CRESCENT, BATH, November 3d, 1825. 

MY LORD : If any subject of these realms may more 
gratefully than another be supposed to exult in the 



CONFESSION. 631 

glories of the illustrious house of "Wellesley, your Excel 
lency will not doubt the sincerity of that devotedness 
with which an humble relation of that house now ven 
tures to solicit your Excellency's notice and protection. 

The grandson of Conway Bleunerhassett, who married 
Elizabeth liarman, daughter of Margaret Welleeley, who 
married Wentworth Harman, I trust the degree of con 
sanguinity which I happily derive from this descent may 
qualify me to aspire to the hope of your Excellency's 
favor, if, upon investigation of my capacity and charac 
ter, I shall be found worthy of it. 

I am of the Irish bar, since 1790 : left it for America, 
in 1795, where I have resided until I finally returned, last 
year, from Canada, to lay claim, at the solicitation of some 
friends, to certain estates of the late Dean Harman, which, 
it was confidently but erroneously believed, I was entitled 
to, in virtue of my descent from Wentworth Harman. The 
failure of this enterprise, consequent upon a long train of 
adverse circumstances, now reduces me to resort to the 
forlorn hope of praying your Excellency to locate me in 
any civil situation in Ireland, the stipend whereof may 
enable me to support a family in a state above penury. 

Confined, since my return to England, by an attendance 
on an aged sister, in feeble health, which has hitherto pre 
vented my personally paying my respects to your Excel 
lency, I beg to avail myself of this occasion to express 
my most ardent wishes for the most perfect happiness of 
that union resulting from your Excellency's late nuptials 
with a lady whose acquaintance Mrs. Blennerhassett is 
proud to recollect she made some years since at Baltimore. 

With the most profound esteem and admiring sense of 



632 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

those virtues and talents that distinguish, as they have 
prepared for history, your Excellency's character and 
fame, I pray to he considered, my lord, 
Your most humhle servant, 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

Although somewhat foreign to the object of these 
memoirs, I can not refrain from affording the reader, even 
at the peril of censure for a departure from the strict line 
of biographical narrative, and pertinency to my subject, 
a more extended acquaintance with the personages ad 
dressed and referred to in the preceding letter. 

The Marquis of Wellesley, with whom Blennerhassett 
claimed consanguinity, was the eldst son of the Earl of 
Mornington, and brother of Arthur, Duke of Wellington, 
was created Marquis of Wellesley, for his services in India 
as Governor-General, and, at the date of his letter, Vice 
roy of Ireland. He had, but the February previous, been 
married to Marianne, daughter of Richard Caton, Esq., 
of Baltimore, where Mrs. Blennerhassett had made her 
acquaintance. At the time of her marriage with the 
Marquis, she was the widow of Robert Patterson, by 
which previous alliance she became, in some degree, con 
nected with the Bonaparte family.* Their nuptials were 



* Jerome Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon I, was born in 
1784, and educated in France. He went to St. Domingo with Le Clerc, as 
a lieutenant, and soon afterward was appointed to the command of a frig 
ate. Napoleon had so high an opinion of his nautical talents, that he made 
him an admiral; he, however, was soon dissatisfied, and transferred him 
to the army, where he arose to the command of a division. About the year 
1801, Jerome visited the United States, and while here married a Miss 
Patterson, daughter of the Marquis of Wellesley's wife's former husband. 
Napoleon compelled him to divorce this lady, with a view of marrying a 



MRS. PATTERSON. 633 

celebrated when Lord Wellesley was in his sixty-fifth and 
the bride in her thirty-first year. Her sister, Louisa 
Catherine Caton, had been previously married to Sir 
Felton Bathurst Harvey, in 1817, and became a widow 
two years after. In 1828, she was again married to the 
present Duke of Leeds, then Marquis of Carmarthen. 

Perhaps no American woman, either before or since, 
has ever won such marks of distinction in Europe, as was 
bestowed on these beautiful and highly-gifted ladies. Al 
though of American parentage, and educated in the less 
ostentatious manners of Republican simplicity, there was, 
nevertheless, an inborn dignity of deportment, and an 
unaffected suavity of address, that at once admitted 
them within the royal circles of Europe, while their 
beauty and accomplishments rendered them successful 
rivals of the titled aristocracy of the old world. 

Mrs. Patterson and her sister had visited Ireland to see 
the country. Having been introduced to the most fash 
ionable circles, she soon became the center of attraction. 
Her religion, which was that of Rome, had it been at 
first revealed, might have restricted, in some measure, 
the generous hospitality which was every-where dis 
played. On her introduction at court, Lord Wellesley 
became enamored of her charms, of which one hundred 
and fifty thousand pounds were said to constitute a part: 
Her fortune, however, it is said, was greatly exaggerated 

princess of the house of Wurtemberg. This marriage took place in 1807, 
and Jerome removed to the territory of Wurtemberg, where he continued 
to reside for some time under the title of Count Montfort. He died in 1860. 
It seems rather a remarkable coincidence, that while the stepmother 
married the brother of the Duke of Wellington, the stepdaughter should 
have married the brother of Napoleon. 



634 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

by the vulgar report ; and the Marquis would have been 
the very last man to have taken it into the account in 
a matrimonial alliance. " Though Hymen," says Sheil, 
" is sometimes addicted to the study of arithmetic, yet 
Lord Wellesley would never set him at this inglorious 
task." It was indeed, with him, altogether an affair of 
the heart. She was that poetic creation an old man's 
darling. He offered her his hand, and was elated with 
its acceptance. 

In the great city of Dublin, the announcement of the 
intended nuptials produced the most profound sensa 
tion. The lord-lieutenant was soon to introduce in their 
midst a vice-queen, of wonderful beauty, and of the 
Roman Catholic religion ; of course, the wildest ex 
citement prevailed among the hitherto oppressed and 
restricted Catholic subjects. Their creed they now con 
ceived, says Sheil, " would receive a sanction from a 
pair of beautiful eyes at the Castle." She would drive 
in state to the chapel, and O'Connell and Sheil hoped 
" that her love of legitimate rhetoric might induce her to 
go in disguise to the gallery of the Catholic House of 
Commons," The Orange faction were alarmed; the 
scepter was to depart from Judah; and the Protestant 
viceroy was to be placed in Catholic leading strings, by 
the intrigues of an American beauty. It was idle, they 
said, to expect, on the part of Lord Wellesley, any very 
rigid adherence to the principles of the Protestant relig 
ion : " How powerful must be the influence of a young 
and beautiful wife upon a man of careless and vacillating 
opinions." 

The marriage may be said to have been a double one ; 



A BALL. 635 

at least, the ceremonies were twice performed ; the first 
by Dr. Magee, a clergyman of the Church of England ; 
the second, by one of the Catholic communion. Thus pol 
itics and religion were reconciled, the rancor of religious 
intolerance appeased, and both parties satisfied that the 
hy menial knot had been tied with a double bow. 

The Marchioness soon became popular in Ireland. She 
was called upon to witness much distress, caused, partly, 
by the improvidence of its inhabitants, but more immedi 
ately by the prostration of its manufacturing interests. 
It was true that her private charities were frequently dis 
pensed to individual objects ; but where poverty and suf 
fering were so universal, however large the contributions 
of her own and her husband's private benevolence, they 
could afford but limited relief to the starving poor. As 
an expedient of temporary relief, it was suggested that a 
" Tabinet Ball " should take place, under the auspices of 
the fair and newly-ennobled lady. I am enabled to con 
dense a description of the scene from an eye-witness.* 

The notice was given in order to afford the young 
ladies in the country an opportunity of coming to town, 
and the llth of May, 1826, was fixed for the metropolitan 
fete. Peremptory orders were issued at the Castle, that 
no person should appear in any other than Irish manu 
facture. A great sensation was produced by what, in 
such a provincial town as Dublin, may be considered as 
an event. Crowds of families flocked from all parts of 
the country ; and if any prudential grazier remonstrated 
against the expense of a journey to the metropolis, the

636 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

eyes of the young ladies having duly filled with tears, 
and mamma having protested that Mr. O'Flaherty might 
as well send the girls to a convent, and doom them to 
old maidenhood for life, the old carriage was ordered to 
the hall-door, and came creaking into town, laden with 
the rural belles, who were to make a conquest at the 
Tabinet Ball. The arrival of the important day was 
looked for with impatience, and many a young heart 
was kept beating under its virgin zone at the pleasura 
ble anticipation. In the interval much good was ac 
complished, and Terpsichore set the loom at work. 
Every milliner's shop gave notes of profuse and prodi 
gal preparation. 

At last, the llth of May arrived, and at about 10 
o'clock the city shook with the roll of carriages hurrying 
from all quarters to the rotunda. Here was an immense 
assemblage of young and beautiful women, dressed in an 
attire which, instead of impairing, tended to set off the 
loveliness of their aspect, and the symmetry of their fine 
forms ; the sweetness and innocency of expression which 
characterizes an Irish lady, sat upon their faces ; modesty, 
kindness, and vivacity played in their features ; and grace 
and joyousness swayed the movement of limbs which 
Chantry would not disdain to select for a model. While 
these gay festivities were proceeding, it was suddenly 
announced that Lord Wellesley and the Marchioness 
were about to enter the room. There was a sudden 
pause in the dancing, and the light airs to which the 
crowd had been moving were soon changed to the Royal 
Anthem. All were eager in their efforts to observe the 
beautiful American. A Yankee and a Papist turned into

a vice-queen ! a novelty never before witnessed in the 
long history of Ireland. There was something strange 
in this caprice of fortune; the crowd were anxious to 
behold the person with whom the blind goddess had 
played so fantastic a freak. Followed by a gorgeous 
retinue of richly-decorated attendants, the viceroy and 
his consort advanced toward the immense assembly, who 
received them with acclamation. She was leaning upon 
his arm. He seemed justly proud of so fair a burden. 
The consciousness of so noble a possession had the effect 
upon him which the inspirations of Genius were said to 
have produced upon a celebrated actor, and he looked 
" six feet high," compact, and well knit together, with 
great alertness in his movements, and with no further 
stoop than sixty winters have left upon him, with a 
searching and finely-irradiated eye, and with cheeks 
which, however furrowed, carry but few traces of the 
tropics. The victor of Tipoo Saib, and the conqueror 
of Captain Rock, entered the rotunda. 

He seemed to personate his sovereign with too elabo 
rate a fidelity to the part, and to forget that he was not 
in permanent possession of the character upon a stage 
which was under the direction of such capricious mana 
gers, and that he must speedily relinquish it to some 
other actor upon the provincial boards. He was, un 
questionably, a man of very great abilities ; a speaker of 
the first order of talent ; a statesman with wide and phil 
osophic views, who never bounded his prospects by an 
artificial horizon. He attained great fame as a politician, 
and had the merit of co-operating with O'Coimell in the 
pacification of Ireland. 



638 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

A throne, surmounted with a gorgeous canopy of gold 
and scarlet, was placed at the extremity of the room for 
nis reception ; and to this seat of mock regality he ad 
vanced with his vice-queen with a measured and stately 
step. When he had reached this place of dignity, his 
suite formed themselves into a hollow square and excluded 
from any too familiar approach the crowd of spectators 
that thronged around. A sort of boundary was formed 
by the lines of aid-de-camps, train-bearers, and pursui 
vants of all kinds. 

The Marquis was dressed in a rich uniform, with a pro 
fusion of. orders. He wore white pantaloons, with short 
boots lined with gold and with tassels of the same ma 
terial. The Marchioness was dressed in white tabinet, 
crossed with a garland of flowers. Her appearance was 
striking, not only as a very fine, but dignified woman. 
Nobody would have suspected that she had not originally 
belonged to that proud aristocracy to which she had been 
recently annexed. She had nothing of la bourgeoise par- 
venue. She executed her courtesies with a remarkable 
gracefulness, and her stateliness sat as naturally upon her 
as though she inherited it by regal descent. Her figure 
was peculiarly well proportioned. Her arms and shoul 
ders, though less suited to Hebe than to Pomona, were 
finely moulded, and her waist delicately small and taper 
ing. Her profile was marked and classical. Her com 
plexion had not that purity and milkiness of color which 
belong to Irish beauty, but it was perhaps not the less 
agreeable from having been touched by a warmer sun. 
Her brows were softly and straightly penciled ; her

cheeks well chiseled, and an expression of permanent 
mildness sat upon her lips. "If I were called upon," 
says Sheil, " to point out, among the portraitures of ficti 
tious life, an illustration of the Marchioness of Wellesley, 
I do not think that with reference to her air, her man 
ners, the polish and urbanity of her address, and the 
placidity of her expression, I could select any more ap 
propriate than the English heroine of Don Juan 

"THE LADY ADELINE AMUNDEVILLE." 

The Marquis and the copartner of his honors, and sole 
tenant of his heart, having made their obeisance to the 
company, seated themselves upon the throne. From this 
position they could command a view of the entire assem 
bly. After the ceremonies of the reception had ended, 
the festivities of the occasion were resumed, and only 
closed when the morning sun eclipsed the glare of arti 
ficial light, and admonished the exhausted dancers that 
the night was spent. 

This remarkable lady seems not to have been exempt 
from the fickleness of fortune, and to have experienced 
sad reverses in her latter days. Queen Victoria granted 
her a residence in Hampton Court Palace, a " refuge for 
the destitute " among the aristocracy, in which many 
pauperized people of rank are rent free. Here she re 
ceived a pension, either from the British Government or 
the East India Company, both of whom Marquis Welles- 
ley had served faithfully and with distinction during a 
long period of years.

From the Poet Campbell. 

10 UPPER SEYMOUR STREET, WEST, 
July VWi, 1825. 

SIR : I am exceedingly sorry that it is wholly out of 
my power to be of the smallest use to you in the publica 
tion of your musical composition. The New Monthly 
never inserts pieces of music, and I have no personal ac 
quaintance either with Mr. Braham or Mr. Sapio. The 
words are not mine, to the best of my recollection ; but I 
should not be ashamed of them. I am therefore obliged 
to return your MSS., and with best wishes I remain, 
Your most obedient servant, THOS. CAMPBELL. 

In 1825, Blennerhassett returned to Canada, only to 
complete his arrangements for a permanent removal. His 
business having been closed, accompanied by his wife 
and youngest son, he sailed from Quebec, never to return. 
His maiden sister, Avis, having offered him a home, his 
family became a part of her household at Cottage Cres 
cent, Bath, in the county of Somersetshire, England. 
The generosity of Avis, whose income was by no means 
ample, afforded them a subsistence during the remainder 
of his life. In the mean time, as is disclosed by his cor 
respondence, he strove arduously, but fruitlessly, to gain 
employment. 

Disheartened by disappointment, and suffering from 
unusual exposure, Mrs. Blennerhassett's health was found 
to be rapidly declining. The climate had proven too 
rigorous for a constitution already impaired, and the dis-

< 
ease,* to which she had long been subject, became greatly 

aggravated. A removal to another locality, where the 
changes were less extreme, was advised by her physician 
as the only certain measure of relief, The Island of 
Jersey, in the British channel, was accordingly determ 
ined on ; thither they removed, accompanied by the 
sister Avis. 

A change of Administration had been but recently 
effected in the Government, and Lord Anglesey was 
placed at the head of the Ordnance Department. Blen- 
nerhassett determined once more to appeal to the gener 
osity of his friend, and addressed him the following letter : 



ST. AUBIN, JERSEY, May 31s, 1827. 

MY LORD: With what feelings I participated in the 
general satisfaction expressed by the better part of the 
public on the triumphant establishment of the present 
Administration since your Lordship's acceptance of office 
in it, the correspondence I have been honored with by 
you, from 1819 to 1823, will more fully attest than I could 
by any assurances. 

I hope that, in inditing this letter, I shall not have ob 
truded upon the indulgence which has always heard and 
answered me. Encouraged by such reflections, I now 
beg leave to state, that my chief motive for this address 
is an anxious desire to offer to your Lordship's considera- 
ation certain suggestions relating to our cannon and 
musketry in proposals for improvements in fabricating 
cannon, by which a 24-pounder, for instance, may be

made of higher proof, and of half the weight, and at 
nearly one-half the cost of the present pieces of the 
same caliber. If this can be realized, of which I have 
no doubt whatever, though the plan was rejected by a 
committee appointed to examine it in the Duke of "Wel 
lington's Administration, who were assuredly mistaken, 
both as to the facts and principles on which the plan is 
founded, what an accession of effect and saving will be 
gained in naval as well as military projectiles, your judg 
ment will not fail to discover. The expense, however, of 
an experiment to settle the question would hardly cost 
Government 100. 

The second proposal has for its object the means of 
giving to the musket now in use all the precision and 
effect of the rifle, without any alteration of the piece 
whatsoever, and also without lessening or at all interfer 
ing with the present rate of time taken up in loading. 
The object is effected by a new mode of making the 
balls, and which is also more speedy and economical than 
the present. The success of this improvement on the 
effect of the musket is unquestionable, and has received 
the approbation of several military men, to whom it has 
been proposed. 

During my retirement from Canada, residing here with 
my family on a small income, I have abandoned all views 
of resuming law-practice, unless in an official situation 
befitting a barrister of 1790. Any civil appointment, 
however, in your Lordship's department, at a European 
station, that could be conveniently offered me ; or one in 
Europe or America for a deserving son, or a present or 
future vacancy, would be most gratefully accepted. 



DISAPPOINTMENT. 643 

I pray to be informed, whether I may or may not ad 
dress you officially, tendering the foregoing proposals, for 
lessening the cost and increasing the effect of ordnance 
and musketry for the advancement of her Majesty's 
service. I have the honor to be, etc., 

HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 



REPLY. 

OFFICE OF ORDNANCE, June 9th, 1827. 

SIR: I am directed by the Marquis of Anglesey to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 81st ult., 
and to acquaint you that his Lordship will be happy to 
receive the suggestions which you may have to offer, and 
will submit them to the consideration of the committee, 
whose province it is to examine and report upon the 
various projects brought before this department. With 
respect to your request, an appointment, Lord Anglesey 
regrets extremely, that the long list of pressing claims, 
received from his predecessor, and the very limited means 
of attending to them, will not allow his Lordship to hold 
out any expectation that it will be in his power to offer 
to your acceptance any appointment. 

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant, 

WM. GOSSETT. 
EL BLENNERHASSETT, ESQ. 

To Harman Blennerhassett, Junior. 

GUERNSEY, December &h, 1828. 

MY DEAR SON : On the 30th ult., my dear Harman, we 
received your letter of the 8th November. We grieve to

learn by it that you labor under pecuniary embarrass 
ments we can not at present relieve. * * * 
### * * * * * 

Since we had your September letter, I have heartily 
rejoiced at the station you had acquired in civil life by 
the attainment of a profession in the practice of which I 
hope and believe you will reach a standing to insure you 
a competency, if not a fortune. And with a view to 
your success I will now present a few observations to 
your consideration. 

The field of advice to a young lawyer is so large that 
it is not easy to choose on which side to enter it. I shall 
therefore only touch, as it were, upon the confines of the 
region of study, by advising you to refuse your mind to 
matters of detail in it, but seize and treasure up in mem 
ory the principles and points which you can draw from 
it for the occasion of pleading and forensic argumenta 
tion, in which your adversary may not, perhaps, be able 
to say as you can, " Condo et comparo quod mox depromere 
passim" 

Blackstone, omitting his feudal system and such other 
parts of the work as, on first reading, you can mark off 
as inapplicable to American polity and jurisprudence, 
should be your text-book. It will furnish the principles 
which will best prepare you to study those constitutions 
and laws of which you are now called upon, in some de 
gree, to direct the administration in your practice. In 
this work you ought to contemplate your vocation from 
a high post of responsibility, which the full discharge of 
duty will reward with the full meed of honor and profit. 
This sentiment will be well supported by your habitual 



ADVICE. 645 

principles of candor and integrity, which will secure to 
you the favor and countenance of the Court, which you 
must ever conciliate by decent humility, without servil 
ity; but it will expose you to insidious attacks of chi 
canery, in practice by your opponents, ever on the watch 
to overreach your contingent neglect of rules, orders or 
notices, which your vigilance must aid your industry to 
counteract in season. 

In your public speaking you must be no competitor for 
the palm of eloquence. Leaving others to aspire to that 
object, it must be your aim to stand before the Court on 
the facts, on which you can show the law and reason of 
your case upon solemn argument. When addressing a 
jury, or examining a witness, you must rather engage the 
feelings of the former by seeming to participate in what 
ever bias you have reason to suspect they entertain, 
whether derived from rumor or personal prejudice, as 
you must endeavor to win the confidence of the latter 
by the urbanity of your manner of interrogation, through 
which you can best throw him off his guard against your 
real purpose, until you have fixed him on one horn of a 
dilemma, from which he has no escape but in the conclu 
sions you have in view. This is, indeed, one of the evo 
lutions of practice, requiring the greatest dexterity and 
address, but yet to be executed with more or less success 
through exercise, directed by observation and judgment, 
which time and industry will supply, but it is never to be 
obtained when marred by fits of irritability of temper, 
against which, through regard for character and true 
interest, you should ever be on your guard, through 
all trials of life, especially those of your practice. 



646 THE BLEXNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

These observations, drawn from the sources of my own 
experience, I shall close here at present.* I have for- 



* The advice here given by Blennerhassett to his son, on entering the 
practice of law, is perhaps more spiritedly given by an Irish gentleman, 
as related by Mr. Shell : " A young barrister," says he, " who looks to 
eminence from his own sheer, unaided merits, must have a mind and frame 
prepared by nature for the endurance of unremitting toil. He must cram 
his memory with the arbitrary principles of a complex and incongruous 
code, and be equally prepared, as occasion serves, to apply or misapply 
them. He must not only surpass his competitors in the art of reasoning 
right from right principles the logic of common life but he must be 
equally an adept in reasoning right from wrong principles, and wrong 
from right ones. He must learn to glory in a perplexing sophistry, as in the 
discovery of an immortal truth. He must make up his mind and his face 
to demonstrate, in open court, with all imaginable gravity, that nonsense 
is replete with meaning, and that the clearest meaning is manifestly non 
sense by construction. This is merit, by 'legal habit of thinking;' and 
to acquire them, he must not only prepare bis faculties by a course of 
assiduous and direct cultivation, but he must absolutely forswear all other 
studies and speculations that may interfere with their perfection. There 
must be no dallying with literature ; no hankering after comprehensive 
theories for the good of men ; away must be wiped all such ' trivial fond 
records.' He must keep to his digests and indexes. He must see nothing 
in mankind but a great collection of plaintiffs and defendants, and con 
sider no revolution in their affairs as comparable, in interest, to the last 
term reports of points of practice decided in banco regis. As he walks the 
streets, he must give way to no sentimental imisings. There must be no 
' commercing with the skies, no idle dreams of love, and rainbows, and 
poetic forms,' and all the bright illusions upon which the ' fancy free' can 
feast. If a thought of love intrudes, it must be connected with the law 
of marriage settlements, and articles of separation from bed and board. 
So of the other passions, and of every the most interesting incident 
and situation in human life -he must view them all with reference to their 
legal effect and operation. If a funeral passes by, instead of permitting 
his imagination to follow the mourners to the grave, he must consider how 
far the executor may not have made himself liable for a waste of assets 
by some supernumerary plumes and hat-bands, beyond ' the state and cir 
cumstances of the deceased;' or, if his eye should light upon a requisi 
tion for a public meeting to petition against a grievance, he must regard 
the grievance as immaterial, but bethink himself whether the wording of 
the requisition be strictly warrantable under the provisions of the Con 
vention Act. 



FRATERNAL. 647 

borne until now to speak of my own health. It is, for 
my time of life, good, save a paralytic affection of the left 
arm and side, which has not left me since the 28th of last 
May, when it seized me. How it may terminate I know 
not, but whenever I shall be called away from this sub 
lunary, to another, and I doubt not a better state, I shall 
not apprehend that my soul will be any thing less jocular 
there than here. That thought in the Emperor Adrian's 
soliloquy, or rather address, to his departing soul, is not 
so happily conceived as the sportive playfulness with 
which he expresses in beautiful diminutives his philo 
sophical composure, in articulo mortis a moment of trial 



" Such is a part, and a very small part, of the probationary discipline to 
which the young candidate for forensic eminence must be prepared to sub 
mit ; and if he can hold out for ten or fifteen years, his superior claims 
may begin to be known and rewarded. But success will bring no dimi 
nution of toil and self-denial. The bodily and mental labor alone of a suc 
cessful barrister's life would be sufficient, if known beforehand, to appal 
the stoutest. Besides this, it has many peculiar rubs and annoyances. 
His life is passed in a tumult of perpetual contention, and he must make 
up his sensibility to give and receive the hardest knocks. He has no choice 
of cases ; he must throw himself, heart and soul, into the most unpromis 
ing that is confided to him. He must fight pitched battles with obstreperous 
witnesses. He must have lungs to out clamor the most clamorous. He must 
make speeches without. He must keep battering for hours at a jury that he 
sees to be impregnable. He is before the public, and at the mercy of public 
opinion ; and if every nerve be not strained to the utmost to achieve what 
is impossible, the public, with its usual good nature, will attribute the fail 
ure to want of zeal or capacity in the advocate, to any thing, rather th*an 
the badness of the cause. Finally, he must appear to be sanguine, even 
after a defeat; and be prepared to tell a knavish client that has been 
beaten out of the courts of common law, that his ' is a clear case for relief 
in equity.' The man who can do all this deserves to succeed, and will suc 
ceed ; but I will not discourage my young American aspirants, that, in the 
United States, they may not ' rationally expect to arrive at eminence in 
their profession upon less rigorous conditions.' " 



648 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

so fearfully met by vulgar hearts. I am so far sunk in 
practice, through dissuetude in my Latin, that I can not 
set about a letter in that language. The lines are these : 

" Anima vagula blandula 
Hospes comesque corporis, 
Quo nunc abidis in loco? 
Palidula, frigida, stridalis, 
Nee dabis ut soles joca ! " * 

The epithet " vagula blandula " beautifully characterizes 
the departing spirit's mild nature, and its being on the 
wing to seek its resting in unknown regions ; but those 
in the last line but one are, to my taste, unhappily chosen, 
as they exhibit the soul like a vulgar ghost or specter, 
bearing about it enough of a camel covering sufficient to 
exhibit our Divine spark ! a pale, shrieking, chilled 
being, not, indeed, capable of jesting. * * * 

Your fond father, HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT. 

The attack of paralysis of which he writes was the 
premonition of his closing career, " The silver cord was 
loosed, and the golden bowl broken." He lingered for 
sometime after ; but death, as he intimates, would at any 
time have been a pleasant messenger. The light of his 
intellect was fading, and his grasp on earthly hopes 
rapidly relaxing. After a residence of three years at St. 



' sweet, roving spirit, 
Guest and companion of my body, 
Where now will you go ? 
Pale, cold and shrieking creature, 
No more, as once, will you be capable of jesting." 



HIS DEATH. 649 

Aubin, it was deemed advisable to remove to the Island 
of Guernsey, where the landed property of Avis was 
situate. Here, at Port Pierre, a second, and then a third 
attack followed ; and, on the 1st of February, 1831, 
wearied with life, he sank to rest, in the sixty-third year 
of his age, with his head pillowed on that bosom which, 
for thirty -five years, had throbbed in perfect unison with 
his own. 

Thus has it been attempted to portray the life and 
character of Blennerhassett. From youth to age, and 
finally to the grave, we have followed his footsteps, with 
an interest excited more through our sympathy than our 
admiration of the man. In his life, there is really noth 
ing remarkable. His scientific acquirements never gave 
to mankind one single truth, nor devised a plan for the 
benefit of the human race. His is not that fame which 
bedecks with laurels the brow of the hero, or follows 
those acts which the world regards as sublimely great. 
Of these, indeed, he was never emulous. His native 
country afforded him the finest fields for militaiy noto 
riety ; and as for political preferment, the times in which 
he lived were propitious to the aspirant. The names of 
his compeers will descend to posterity in living colors as 
long as down-trodden Ireland' shall retain a place on the 
page of history. That celebrity which attended his name 
was not of his seeking. His was the peculiar tempera 
ment, fitted better for the enjoyments of private life than 
the battle-field or the political arena. For this, he re 
signed magnificence and ease for obscurity in a western 
wilderness, where he enjoyed, for a time, that uninter- 



650 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

rupted repose which had so long attracted his fancy. 
There, too, he would have doubtless remained hut for 
the circumstances heretofore narrated. 

At the death of her husband, Mrs. Blennerhassett was 
left with a family of dependent children, for whom her 
greatest exertions could hardly procure subsistence. Long 
and arduously she toiled, both mentally and physically, 
to avoid impending poverty. It was not only necessary 
that they should be fed and clothed, but it was also im 
portant that they should receive such an education as 
would, at least, fit them for the business transactions of 
life. She had now arrived at an age when elasticity, both 
of body and mind, was nearly destroyed; and this of 
itself was sufficient to prevent any expectation of future 
success. Under such gloomy prospects, she resolved to 
visit the United States and petition the Government for 
relief. 

In this, she is not to be regarded as a mendicant asking 
for alms, but rather as asserting her rights ; rights most 
wantonly violated by the officers of a government pledged 
to the protection of its citizens. The agents of the Pres 
ident had not only detained the boats and stores prepared 
for the enterprise of Burr, but had actually destroyed the 
former and consumed the latter. They had invaded the 
sanctity of her household; had appropriated to them 
selves and wasted her provisions ; broken her furniture ; 
laid waste the gardens; torn down the fences; and had 
done serious injury to the mansion. They had put Blen 
nerhassett to an enormous expense in defending himself at 
Richmond ; they, in fact, had reduced him from affluence 



TO CONGRESS. 651 

to comparative poverty. Was this extraordinary sacri 
fice to be justified, and its victims to remain unsatisfied 
from the mere fact that Blennerhassett was accused of 
hostility toward the Government ? Could such an inva 
sion of private rights have been legalized, if he had been 
found guilty of the acts with which he was charged ? 

In the year 1842, Mrs. Blennerhassett, with an invalid 
son, visited ISTew York, and, through the hands of her 
friends, preferred a petition to Congress. "With a meek 
ness of disposition which is remarkable, when we recol 
lect her grievances, she says : 

" Your memorialist does not desire to exaggerate the 
conduct of the said armed men, or the injuries done by 
them ; but she can truly say, that, before their visit, the 
residence of her family had been noted for its elegance 
and high state of improvement ; and that they left it in a 
comparative state of ruin and waste. And, as instances 
of the mischievous and destructive spirit which appeared 
to govern them, she would mention, that, while they 
occupied as a guard-room one of the best apartments in 
the house, the building of which cost nearly forty thou 
sand dollars, a musket or rifle ball was deliberately fired 
into the ceiling, by which it was much defaced and in 
jured ; and that they wantonly destroyed many pieces of 
valuable furniture. She would also state that, being ap 
parently under no restraint, they indulged in continual 
drunkenness and riot, offering many indignities to your 
memorialist and treating her domestics with violence. 

" These outrages were committed upon an unoffending 
and defenseless family, in the absence of their natural 



652 THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

protector, your memorialist's husband being then away 
from home ; and that, in answer to such remonstrances 
as she ventured to make against the consumption, waste 
and destruction of his property, she was told, by those 
who assumed to have the command, that they held the 
property for the United States, by order of the President, 
and were privileged to use it, and should use it as they 
pleased. It is with pain that your memorialist reverts to 
events, which, in their consequences, have reduced a once 
happy family, from affluence and comfort, to comparative 
want and wretchedness ; which blighted the prospects of 
her children, and made herself, in the decline of life, a 
wanderer on the face of the earth." 

Robert Emmett, the son of Thomas Addis, and nephew 
of the celebrated Irish patriot, interested himself in her 
behalf. He had been the intimate friend of Blennerhas- 
sett, and sympathized deeply with his afflicted family. 
In forwarding her memorial to the Hon. Henry Clay of 
the United States Senate, he remarks: "Mrs. Blenner- 
hassett is now in this (New York) city, residing in very 
humble circumstances, bestowing her cares on a son, who, 
by long poverty and sickness, is reduced to utter imbe 
cility, both of body and mind ; unable to assist her, or 
provide for his own wants. In her present destitute situ 
ation, the smallest amount of relief would be thankfully 
received by her. Her condition is one of absolute want, 
and she has but a short time left to enjoy any better for 
tune in this world."* 

* Mrs. B. was in the receipt of a small rent received from a house in 
England, left to the family by the sister of Blennerhassett. 



JUSTICE. 

Her statement, with regard to the destruction of her 
property, and the acts of the officers of the Government, 
were fully corroborated by William Robinson, jun., and 
Morgan Neville, both of whom were present at the island 
when the occurrences took place. An estimate of the 
property destroyed was made out by Dudley Woodbridge, 
the former partner of Blennerhassett in mercantile trans 
actions, which also accompanied her petition. 

It would be presumed that, under such a state of cir 
cumstances, the American Congress would not long hesi 
tate in granting her full indemnity for past injuries. Mr. 
Clay presented the petition, and eloquently advocated its 
justice. He had known Blennerhassett in the noontide 
of his prosperity, when not a cloud darkened the horizon 
of his effulgent future ; he had visited his rural palace, 
and regaled himself with the luxuries it afforded. He 
had partaken of its hospitalities, and been entertained by 
the sprightly conversation of its inmates. He had wit 
nessed Blennerhassett's arrest, in Kentucky, and man 
fully exerted himself in his defense. He had afterward 
witnessed his declining fortunes ; and, when destruction 
had laid waste his possessions, had wandered over .the 
ruins with feelings of unsuppressed sympathy. 

The memorial having been referred to the appropriate 
committee, of which the Hon. William Woodbridge was 
chairman, he returned a report, alike honorable to his 
intelligence and clear sense of justice. He advocated the 
claim as legal and proper, and one which ought to be 
allowed, notwithstanding it had been thirty-six years 
since the events transpired. " Not to do so would be un 
worthy a wise or just nation." 



654: THE BLENNERHASSETT PAPERS. 

The claim would doubtless have met with the favor of 
Congress, had not an event transpired, in the meanwhile, 
which rendered further action unnecessary. Death had 
visited the suffering applicant, and relieved her of earthly 
wants. In a humhle abode, in the city of !N"ew York, 
her spirit had silently departed ! No soothing hand of a 
relative fanned her fevered temples, nor wiped from her 
brow the chilly dews of expiring nature. Within that 
lonely chamber, it was reserved to strangers to witness 
the last sad scenes. She, who had been born in affluence ; 
to whom the world appeared, in early life, as Paradise 
before the fall ; who had been honored by the attentions 
of the great and the praises of the humble ; whose heart 
was ever open to the cries of distress, and whose hands 
were ever ready to relieve the wants of the needy, had, 
in her turn, to ask the charities of the world ! Although 
the kindly ministrations of a society of Irish females 
served, in some measure, to assuage the agonies of her 
parting hours, still it was hard to die thus destitute and 
deserted ; for 

" On some fond breast the parting soul relies, 
Some pious drops the closing eye requires." 

And now, as the sable hearse moved slowly along, fol 
lowed only by those devoted " sisters of charity," it ex 
cited no interest in the passing crowd. ~No mock pageant 
indicated the life or station of the deceased. In one of 
the cemeteries of that city remains all that is earthly of 
that once accomplished lady, separated from the tomb of 
her husband by the wide Atlantic. While on their

i. 

SECRET CORRESPONDENCE. 

GENERAL WILKINSON and Burr began their correspondence 
in cipher about the years 1800 and 1801, near the period at 
which the latter ascended the chair of the Vice-Presidency. 
For this purpose they adopted three different ciphers. 

The first is called the hieroglyphic : 

X 1/2) - O^l-f-^V"V^ y^vo-A" 

O President. 

O Vice-President. 

-i- Secretary of State. 

It was invented by General Wilkinson and Captain Camp 
bell Smith as long ago as the year 1794, '95, or '96, for the 
purpose of communicating confidentially with the general offi 
cers in the Western country. 

Another cipher, of a somewhat similar construction, was de 
vised by Captain Smith in 1791, in which the hieroglyphics 
representing the President and Vice-President are the same 
with those used in the cipher of Col. Burr. 

The second is denominated the arbitrary alphabet cipher; 
and was formed by Burr and Wilkinson in the year 1799 or 

1800. 

ABCDEFGH. 

- i x x A V J & 

1234

658 APPENDIX. 

This cipher was nothing more than a substitution of char 
acters in the place of letters which actually compose the alpha 
bet. It was also used in figures, from one to ten. 

The third is styled the dictionary cipher and was adopted 
by them in the year 1800. The famous letters from Burr to 
Wilkinson, of the 22d July, 1806, delivered by Swartwout at 
Natchez, and its duplicate of the 29th of the same month, 
conveyed to Bollman, were written partly in each of these two 
ciphers, and partly in English. The Wilmington edition of 
Entick's Pocket Dictionary of 1800 served as the key, by 
which such part of the letters as were written in figures were 
to be interpreted. For example, if the figures 3 and 4 were 
used, the figure 3 pointed out the page in the book, and 4 the 
number of the word intended counting from the top in the 
first or second column on the page, which latter circumstance 
was indicated by a slight mark above or below the 4. 

General Dayton's letters of the 16th and 24th July, which 
were forwarded in company with Burr's by Swartwout and 
Bollman, were written partly in hieroglyphics and the ' arbi 
trary alphabetical ciphers, above described, partly in English, 
but principally in Dayton's own cipher, of which the key-word 
is FRANCE. 

It is composed in the following manner, the letters of the 
alphabet being numbered thus : 

1234567890 
abode fghij 

In order to decipher a letter or passage written in cipher, 
take the first letter of the key-word F, fix on the letter in the 
series of the alphabet; count forward from that letter as many 
letters as are equal to the first figure in the ciphered letter; 
as 8, for example, which will give I, and I will be the first 
letter of the first word; then take the second letter of the 



APPENDIX. 659 

key-word R, and, in the same manner as in the first instance, 
count forward as many letters as are equal to the second fig 
ure ; as 2, which will give the second letter T, completing 
the first word, It. Continue the same way with the ensuing 
letters of the key-word, until they are finished ; and then 
begin again thus going through the key-word again and 
again until the letter is completed. 

In the ciphered letter the figure, or aggregate of figures rep 
resenting words, are separated by commas. 

There was another cipher in use among some of the accom 
plices in this enterprise, the key-word of which was CUBA. 
The use of this cipher may be understood from the following 
scheme and explanations :

opposite to this letter represents the first letter of that word. 
To find the figure expressive of the second letter, look for 
that letter in the second column, and the figure opposite to 
that letter, represents the second letter in the word. Continue 
in the same way with respect to the other two columns, if it 
be a word of three or four letters. But if it contains more 
than four letters, you must return to the first column, and 
proceed in the same manner ; that is, the fifth letter of the 
word is to be found in the first column under ; the sixth 
letter in the second column, and so on. Thus, if Hope was 
the first word in the epistle, look for the letter H in the first 
column under C, which is opposite the figure 6 as the repre 
sentative of the first letter; the letter is to be sought for 
in the second column, and is represented by the number 21 ; 
and so on with the letters P and E. 

In the ciphered letters, the figures representing letters are 
separated by periods. 

The reader will immediately perceive that besides France 
and Cuba, any other words might be used as key-words of 
these ciphers, according to the discretion of the writer and 
his correspondent. The difficulty of discovering the key to 
one of these ciphered letters would be still further augmented 
by the writer's shifting his key-word for different epistles, 
according to some rule previously agreed on. The difficulty 
would be incalculably increased, if the writer not only con 
tinues to shift his key -word, but the cipher itself.

II. 

THE BATTLE OF MUSKINGUM, OR DEFEAT OF THE BURRITES. 
NOVEMBER, 1806, BY GENERAL E. W. TUPPER. 

IT lias been the province of the bards in all ages to record 
the glorious achievements of their warriors. The heroes of 
the Nile, Marengo and Austerlitz, have had their honors re 
counted ; and shall not those of Muskingum live, while thous 
ands are forgotten ? Yes, ye virtuous few ! Ye also shall 
live ! and millions yet unborn, while passing, shall point to 
the shores of Muskingum and the plains of Marietta, and say, 
" There fought the brave, and there the immortal fell ! " 
The following imitation of the " Battle of the Kegs " is offered 
!.o the public, not without its many imperfections. The writer 
has, in several instances, chosen to sacrifice the harmony of 
his rhymes to the more essential article truth. 

Ye jovial throng, come join the song 

I sing of glorious feats, sirs ; 
Of bloodless wounds, of laurels, crowns, 

Of charges, and retreats, sirs ; 

Of thundering guns, and honors won, 

By men of daring courage; 
Of such as dine on beef and wine, 

And such a-s sup their porridge. 



662 APPENDIX. 

"When Blanny's fleet, so snug and neat, 
Came floating down the tide, sirs, 

Ahead was seen, one-eyed Clark Green,* 
To work them, or to guide, sirs. 

Our General brave,f the order gave, 
" To arms ! to arms ! in season ! 

Old Blanny's boats, most careless float, 
Brim-full of death and treason!" 

A few young boys, their mother's joys, 
And five men there were found, sirs, 

Floating at ease each little sees 

Or dreams of death and wound, sirs. 

" Fly to the bank ! on either flank ! 
We'll fire from every corner; 
"We'll stain with blood Muskingum's flood, 
And gain immortal honor. 

The cannon there shall rend the air, 
Loaded with broken spikes, boys, 

While our cold lead t hurled by each head, 
Shall give the knaves the gripes, boys. 

Let not maids sigh, or children cry, 
Or mothers drop a tear, boys ; 

I have the BaronJ in my head ; 

Therefore you've nought to fear, boys 

Now to your posts, this numerous host; 

Be manly, firm and steady. 
But do not fire, till I retire, 

And say when I am ready." 



* A "bold man, well known in those days, 
t Major-General Buell. 

J The only system of military tactics then in use in the Western coun 
try, among the officers, was that of Baron Steuben. 



APPENDIX. 603 



Tho Deputy,* courageously, 

Rode forth in power and pride, sirs; 
Twitching his reins, the man of brainsf 

Was posted by his side, sirs. 

The men in ranks stand on the banks, 
While, distant from its border, 

The active aid scours the parade, 
And gives the general order. 

"First, at command, bid them to stand; 

Then, if one rascal gains out, 
Or lifts his poll; G d d n his soul, 
And blow the traitors brains out." 

The night was dark ; silent came Clark 
With twelve or fifteen more, sirs; 

While Paddy Hill, with voice most shrill, 
Hooped ! as was said before, sirs. 

The trembling ranks, along the banks, 
Fly into Shipman's manger; 

While old Clark Green, with voice serene, 
Cried, " Soldiers, there 's no danger." 

" Our guns, good souls, are setting poles ; 

Dead hogs, I ! m sure, can 't bite you ; J 
Along each keel is Indian meal ; 

There 's nothing here need fright you." 

Out of the barn, still in alarm, 
Came fifty men, or more, sirs, 

And seized each boat and other float, 
And tied them to the shore, sirs. 



* Governor Meigs. 
f Name withheld. 
\ The boats had in them hogs recently slaughtered. 



664 APPENDIX. 

This plunder rare, they sport and share, 
And each a portion grapples. 

'T was half a kneel* of Indian meal, 
And ten of Putnam's apples/f 

The boats they drop to Allen's shop, 
Commanded by O'Flannon, 

Where, lashed ashore, without an oar, 
They lay beneath the cannon. 

This band so bold, the night being cold, 
And blacksmith's shop being handy; 

Around the forge they drink and gorge 
On whisky and peach-brandy. 

Two honest tars, who had some scars, 

Beheld their trepidation; 
Cries Tom, " Come, Jack, let's fire a crack; 

'T will fright them like damnation. 

Tyler, they say, lies at Belpre, 
Snug in old Blanny's quarters; 

Yet this pale host tremble like ghosts, 
For fear he '11 walk on waters." 

No more was said, but off they sped, 
To fix what they 'd begun on; 

At one o'clock, firm as a rock, 

They fired the spun-yarn cannon. 

Trembling and wan stood every man ; 

Then bounced and shouted murder; 
While Sergeant Morse squealed like a horse, 

To get the folks to order. 



* A measure of two quarts. 

t There were a few apples in the boats belonging to A. W. Putnam, of 
Belprd. 



APPENDIX. 665 

Ten men went out, and looked about; 

A hearty set of fellows ; 
Some hid in holes, behind the coals, 

And some behind the bellows. 

The Cor'ner* swore, the western shore, 

He saw with muskets bristle ; 
Some stamp'd the ground ; 't was cannon sound. 

They heard the grape-shot whistle. 

The Deputy mounted " Old Bay," 

When first he heard the rattle, 
Then changed his course, " great men are scarce ; " 

I 'd better keep from battle." 

The General f flew, to meet the crew, 

His jacket flying loose, sirs; 
Instead of sword, he seized his board; 

Instead of hat, his goose, sirs. 

'Tyler's," he cried, "on 't other side; 

Your spikes will never do it; 
The cannon's bore will hold some more; 
Then thrust his goose into it." 

Sol raised his head ; cold spectres fled ; 

Each man resumed his courage; 
Captain O'Flan dismissed each man 

To breakfast on cold porridge. 

Joel Bowen. t Buell was a tailor by trade.
